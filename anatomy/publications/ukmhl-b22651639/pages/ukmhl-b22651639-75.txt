67 matter fairly before the reader, unless I describe the experiment by which he proposed to investigate or illustrate it. A living dog, having been opened in the abdomen, has his bihary duct dissected; being divided, a tube is inserted therein. An opening is now made into his bowels, and a solution of rhubarb thrown into the canal. A tube is also inserted into the windpipe, and, by means of a pair of bellows, air is blown in to keep up artificial respiration. The medicine having been injected into the alimentary canal, the wound in the abdomen is closed, and the animal wrapped up in cotton wadding, to prevent a fall of the temperature. " Q. Then the actual operation would last about " half an hour ? " A. About half an hour. " Q. In what state was the dog at the end of that " half hom^ ? " A. Simply paralyzed by curari—having artificial " respiration, by means of a pair of bellows, kept up— " having a tube in its common bile duct, with the bile " dropping from it. " Q. And in that state it would go on for eight " hours ? " A. Not exactly; not simply in that state. The " wound in the abdominal wall being once or twice, " or sometimes three or four times, I dare say, opened, " and a substance injected into the bowels; the wound " was then closed again, and the animal wrapped up " in cotton wadding. " Q. Then, supposing that curari does not deaden " pain, would there not be very great pain during that *' eight hours ? f 2

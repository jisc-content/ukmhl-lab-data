48 contraction of the arteries was consequent on their vital force, and how far it resulted from mere elasticity. In aid of this enquiry he bled a horse to death, and then measured various arteries in different states of rest or artificial extensionâ€”First, when taken from the body; then he stretched them as far as he could, and measured them again; lastly, having allowed them to contract, he measured them a third time ; and the difference between the last and that when first taken from the body, immediately after death, he considered the degree of contraction depending on their vital, or muscular power. Then he produced inflammation in a rabbit's ear, and, hav- ing killed the animal, he injected the vessel to show the enlargement of vessels in inflammation, by com- paring the ear, which was the subject of experiment, with the other. Long ago, I observed on the useless- ness of these experiments: Do we not see the vessels enlarge before our eyes in ophthalmia? Do we not see vessels now carrying red blood, which ordinarily only carry colourless fluids? Do we not feel the artery going to a whitlow beating with more vio- lence than that in the opposite finger ? Do we not see the veins more distended returning from an in- flamed part ? Do we not feel pulsations which did not affect our sensations before ? Do we not see the part vividly red, there being no fluid in the body of that colour but the blood ? -If there be anything in medical science like demonstration, surely this is it. There is no possible objection to it, whilst, were we- disposed to refine, the case of the rabbit's ear might perhaps be open to objection. The vessels might,

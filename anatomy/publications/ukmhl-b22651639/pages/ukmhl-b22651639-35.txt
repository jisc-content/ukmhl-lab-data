In other parts of Dr. Hope's work, we find other proofs of the differences of opinion amongst Vivi- sectors, at pp. 39, 40, etc., in relation to other theories, which were formerly broached by himself, " hit noio discarded^ He adds, in relation to another theory of M.

It is worthy of remark, too, that here one of the reasons assigned is from what happens in " Dropsy of " the Pericardium;'^ thus appealing, as Vivisectors are often forced to do, to the superior authority of patho- logical phenomena in the human subject.

Many years ago I cited examples from the works of those who have been most distinguished in this mode of enquiry; j for, after all, however such differences

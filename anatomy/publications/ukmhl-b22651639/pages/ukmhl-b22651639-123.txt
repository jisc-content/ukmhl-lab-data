115 I have copied the foregoing extracts from Sir William Ferguson's evidence, because they go closer to the question that, as a practical advocate of scien- tific surgery, I have always endeavoured to hold. Of late the advocates of Vivisection have, so to speak, taken new ground—at least, some of them— and instead of testing the value or the justification of experiments on living animals, by their alleged prac- tical benefits in the study or treatment of disease, we have to hear those experiments justified by gentlemen who are termed biologists, or students of pure 23hysi- ology; that is to say, having no necessary relation to the practice of medicine and surgery. Now, no one has ever contended that it is impossible to find out something from the dissection of a living animal; but the contention is that you cannot find out anything of any value, which may not be discovered from better and more certain modes of enquiry, and that Vivisec- tion is not only unproductive, but, in fact, a great mistake. What Su" William Ferguson says of anges- thetics, as obscm'ing any question, I have long ago, over and over again, demonstrated by the plainest rules of common sense. It is no more reasonable to argue from the phenomena in an animal under an angesthetic, than it would be to reason with a man who was intoxicated by alchohol, or narcotized by opium or tobacco; but to a man who does not at once see this, all reasoning is just as useless in the one case as in the other. He is plenarily absorbed by one idea, and (like the eagle, concentrating his attention on the carrion) does not see the trap on the contiguous rock, which has been placed there to catch him. I 2

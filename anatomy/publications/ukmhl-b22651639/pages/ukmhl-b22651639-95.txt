87 The manner in which this statement is qualified, suggests some difficulties in arriving at what may bo oalled a positive and clear definition of it. A certain amount of pain, when a man can see a reasonable hope of being benefited by it, gives something indefinite, but still not unopen to objection; but the statement that the necessary death of animals, and the pain they suffer, as a sort of warranty for the proceedings of the Vivisector, is not only as an argument unsound, but, to use no other term, is either unknowing or reticent, with regard to one of the most interesting series of phenomena of natural history; that is to say, of the numerous and varied forms of phenomena which, what- ever other relations they may have, are most interest- ing. I refer to the circumstances observable alike in predaceous animals and those on whom they prey— facts which, as I have said, whatever other relations they may have, appear to have two, of which the proximate effect and general prevalence are of great interest, as evidently contributory to the painless and rapid death of the victim. These numerous pheno- mena it is not necessary that I should here detail. They may be easily deduced fi^om observations of the habits of any animals, whether beasts, birds, fishes, or insects, that are predaceous. I have only to add that pathology must be cultivated by better and higher modes of study than by Vivisection; by a more en- larged and circumspective view of the various forces which act on living beings; by a far more methodical and complete annotation of the phenomena of the living, and more accurate and constant testing any ■conclusion by the examination of the dead; by a more

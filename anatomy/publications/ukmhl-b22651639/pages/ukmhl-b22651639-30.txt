The experiments of Dr. Hope were referred to by some of the witnesses before the Royal Commission, in proof of the advantages of Vivisection. These we will now consider. The industry displayed by Dr. Hope in his in- vestigation of diseases of the heart invites our respectful recognition. Whatever be our mode of Study, industry is, after all, the material—the indispensable requisition to all useful discovery. Nevertheless, I cannot perceive that the mode which Dr. Hope adopted, in the least degTee superseded the necessity for other modes of enqmry. And further, that these are not only as accessible as are Vivisections, but infinitely superior, in their logical and scientific claims, to that mode of study, and for which it is impossible to regard experiments on living animals as an acceptable, or even reasonable substi- tute. It may occur to some, in reference to the experiments chiefly made use of by the witnesses, whether Dr. Hope can be cited as a Vivisector at all; but, not to digress, let us proceed. Affections of the heart—comprising in that term not only those which exhibit changes of structure, but those also which we understand as functional—are Tery common; and the former, sooner or later, are too frequently fatal.

I do not say that I entertain this opinion, but no one can assert that it is impossible; whilst there is no objection of this kind attached to the phenomena which I have mentioned as observable in the ordinary development of inflammation in the human subject. Hunter has been seldom studied, so far as I know, with anything like the attention he deserves. He is in some points of view a difficult author ; he is a very profound thinker, and there is a circumspect regard and perception of facts, bearing more or less on the subject he may be more immediately engaged in, which justifies that epithet of Abernethy's, which induced him so often to use the termâ€”"That Argus-eyed man, " John Hunter." But we must recollect the state of things in John Hunter's time, before we can under- stand how such a mind could entertain experiments on animals as an auspicious source of investigation; but this would lead me far beyond my prescribed limits. Hunter rendered services to medical science which have represented seeds, which have germinated already so as to afford very important truths, and which hold out prospects of sooner or later conferring- more of a positive character on medical science, than the labours of any writer with whom I am acquainted. Let us hasten then to those, and correct that idea, E

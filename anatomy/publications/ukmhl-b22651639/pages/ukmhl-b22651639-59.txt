He, therefore, fully appreciated wliat lie said of the sympathies, and, with that rapid grasp of the more immediately useful portion of any research, said: "John Ilnnter proved that the whole " body sympathised with all its parts." And here we see the beginning of that important practical deduc- tion of Abernethy's—" The Constitutional Origin of " Local Diseases." Now, these so-called sympathies are what any of my readers may, in great part, observe for themselves.

Well, John Hunter would simply say that the head sympathised with the stomach. He then went on to trace these relations between various parts, showing that sometimes the sympathising part or organ seemed to suffer more than the part whence the sympathy was excited. Now, every word of this, as we shall show, was convertible to most important purposes.

I have already remarked on the relation between John Hunter's showing that the whole body sympathised with all its parts, and the *' constitutional origin of local disease" of Abernethy; and here, I may state, lay the first germinations of that harvest, of which it is impossible as yet to predict £ 2

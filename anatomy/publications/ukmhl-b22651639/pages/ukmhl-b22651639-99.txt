Tlien again, it is evident that some direction and perhaps varied directions, might "be given by persons who may have had actual obser- vation of the results already known, or from others who may have given attention to the scientific bearings of the subject. For example, we have already some phenomena which suggest that all injurious matters, if they are got rid of at all, are expelled or otherwise rendered innocuous coincidently with powerful excite- ment of some secretion; and even where this is not effected, we have many phenomena which suggest the endeavour. It is therefore, I conceive, one direction which might be given to such experiments on the snake-bitten patient, to furnish anyone so exposed with the antidote alone, and also combined with sub- stances of great power as exciting secretion, making the vehicle alcohol, or any other matter having highly stimulating properties. I suggest these views with all possible dif&dence, and merely as exemplifying one or two of the multifarious methods in which these expe- riments could be instituted on the instant, by persons furnished with the respective means. With such opportunities on the human subject, I can- not conceive that experiments on animals can be other- wise than open to the objection of substituting for so -abundant and practical field of enquiry that which must be admitted, however otherwise viewed, as an imperfect or questionable analogy. In concluding these few remarks on Sir James Paget's evidence, I cannot but think that the time will come, as in the case of the celebrated MuUer, when he will lose his faith in Vivisection; for I infer, from the general tone of his

63 lu liis ensuing observations, lie met witli many circumstances of an exceedingly puzzling nature, but whicli lie investigated with a diligence and penetrative sagacity of observation, wliicli was rewarded by tlie discovery of facts, and suggestive of analogies be- tween tlie small-pox and tlie vaccine, wliicli was really a very proximate link in the chain which was to result in the discovery. Having remarked circumstances which led him to say, "Here the analogy between the " virus of small-pox and cow pox becomes remark- " ably conspicuous," he says : " Daring the investi- " gation of the casual cow pox, I was struck with the " idea that it might be practicable to propagate the disease by inoculation, after the manner of the small- *' pox, first from the cow, and finally from one human " being to another. I anxiously waited some time for " an opportunity of putting this theory to the test. At " length the period arrived. The first experiment was " made upon a lad by the name of Phipps, in the " spring of the year 1796, in whose arm a little of the " vaccine virus was inserted, taken/rom the hand of a " young woman, who had been accidentally infected by " a cow. Notwithstanding the resemblance which " the pustule thus excited in the boy's arm bore to variolous inoculation, yet, as the indisposition attend- " ing it was barely perceptible, I could scarcely per- " suade myself that the patient was secure from the *' small-pox. However, on his being inoculated some ^' months afterwards, it proved that he was secure. " This case inspired me with confidence, and, as soon " as I could again furnish myself with virus from the *' cow, I made an arrangement for a series of inocula-

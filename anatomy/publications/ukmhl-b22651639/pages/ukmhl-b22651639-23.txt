15 very significant of tlie little care witli wliicli sucli sources have been examined. I cannot but think that if anything like the care required had been observed, the confusion of ideas of which I have seen so many evidences, might have been avoided. When anything has been discovered by one who had been occupied in Vivisection, the discovery has been at once referred to it, and in cases wherein. Vivisection had nothing to do with the matter. John Hunter is a remarkable example of one whose useful works have been thus falsely ascribed to Vivisection, of which we shall treat in its proper place. In treating of the circulation of the blood, it is im- portant to a clear view of the subject that we should so far digress as to give some idea of the mechanical or hydrauhc arrangement by which the blood is distributed in man. Perhaps the most simple view is to say that there is a series of continuous tubes, commencing in some of large size, which are divided and subdivided into very numerous smaller and smaller tubes as they reach the various parts of the body ; having become infinitely small, they gradually coalesce into larger and larger tubes, until they return to the part whence they set out (the heart). The first-named vessels or tubes are called arteries, and are connected with the left side of the heart; the returning tubes are called veins, and deliver their blood to the right side of the heart. From this part the blood is sent through the lungs, again returned to the left side of the heart, whence it is distributed as before to all parts of the body. The arteries are of somewhat different structure from the

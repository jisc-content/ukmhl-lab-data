119 in some otlier â€” the subject of continued com- mentary. I believe tbey will severally exemplify the loose manner in which one of the subjects most impor- tant to mankind has been dealt with by some of the witnesses in the Royal Commission. The alleged dis- covery of the lymphatics by Aselli, by Vivisection, and the labours of M. Claude Bernard, must be made the subject of a careful analysis. People have no idea of the labour all these things requu^e in order to ensure that correctness which has often been so wantonly disregarded in some of the evidence. I wish, how- ever, that both the subjects of the History of the Lymphatics and the Labours of Claude Bernard, be regarded as subject of my comments still in abeyance. The former, because I desire to consult some further writers on the subject; and the latter, because he has experimented so largely, that the exposure of the fal- lacy of his investigations may, and will, require a somewhat long and elaborate analysis. I have now only an opportunity for a few remarks on either of these writers. With regard to Aselh, I beheve that his obser- vation of the lymphatics might have occurred during his operation on a living dog for another purpose; but I am well convinced that if it had been done expressly for that purpose, it was not at all necessary, as the lymphatics may be observed under favourable condi- ditions without any Vivisection at all, if an animal dies suddenly, or is killed during the process of diges- tion. But those who investigate physiology merely from an anatomical point of view, and who, as anatomists^ naturally desire to make everything an object of sight, seem to rush to the " non sequitur" conclusion that

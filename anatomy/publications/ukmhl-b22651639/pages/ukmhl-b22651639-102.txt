And I beg the reader's attention to the narrative, because, exclusive of the material facts of the case, the subjects, as a. vs^hole, are excellent illustrations of the faults which almost invariably attend Vivisectional enquiries, and which represent, as it appears to me, the founda- tion of Vivisectional errors. Physiological phenomena furnish abundant phenomena illustrating that to which I refer; where the mind, being strong in some fore- gone conclusion, is not only heedless even of very obvious facts, but entirely neglectful of that circum- spection of surrounding relations, which is so essential to all philosophical enquiries. Sir Astley Cooper was a dexterous and able surgeon. He had a rapid pro- gress to popularity and a large practice, which, when too early obtained, is somewhat unfavourable to cultm-e of the philosophic mind. There is httle time for that sustained exercise of thought which seems essential to effective study. Now, Sir Astley thought that when the neck of the thigh bone was fi^actured within the bag or capsule, which encloses the joint of the hip, repair by bony union was impracticable. He saw that the neck of the thigh bone at that part was (so to speak) somewhat isolated, when compared with other parts, or to their immediate and surrounding connec- tions, and on this ground decided that fi-acture of it could not be repaired by bony union; in other words, that the union of such an injury was necessarily Hga- mentoua. Now, the facts which would show the pro- bable unsoundness of this reasoning were perfectly well known to Sir Astley, but he appears to have had

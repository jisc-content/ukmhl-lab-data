In some cases that neglect leads to the excitement of organs, when, so to speak, the verij essence of the treatment, and the only ground of hope, is to keep those organs in the utmost practical condition of repose. This, again, is not all. The knowledge and familiarity with compensating actions, enables us to reflect light back in some most difficult cases in enquu^ing in abnormal conditions of excessive function, as to what function the oeconomy, is thus sujDplementing by transferring its labours on another.

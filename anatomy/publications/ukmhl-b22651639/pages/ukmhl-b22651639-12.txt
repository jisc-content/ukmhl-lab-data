On the other hand, a great number of persons have demm^red to the foregoing reasoning, and they have denied the accm^acy of the statements on which it is founded.

They also allege that many of the assertions of the Vivisectionists, with regard to the som^ces of particular discoveries, are demonstrably incorrect.

As'ain, it is contended that if Vivisection be thus questionable, the substitution of it for higher and better modes of enquiry into the nature and treat- ment of disease, only intensifies its scientific objections and its alleged criminality, by making it gratuitously subservient to an avowed selfishness.

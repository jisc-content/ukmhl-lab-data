37 nervous centres may have been subjected during tbe "paroxysm. Without attention to this living patho- *' logy, even morbid anatomy may lead us to erroneous "conclusions." I know a case of a gentleman who has for years lost every useful power over his lower extremities, so that he cannot walk without support, and whose arms are so nearly helpless, that he has but very restricted use of them ; who has been treated for years by bromide of potassium and other so-called remedies, without ever having had, so far as I can understand, any eflGlcient attention, much less that ana- lytical examination of his internal organs, so strongly suggested by a comprehensive view of his history, and who has accordingly obtained no result but that of slowly diminishing power. I believe, had this case been tested with more reference to the internal organs, and the correlations of the sympathetics with the spinal marrow, in which I believe Hall would have concurred, it might have resulted in the greatest benefit. To conclude, I have endeavoured to show that the experiments of Dr. Marshall Hall were unnecessary, and how from his own work, as well as from my own observations, they are superseded by the superior advantages of carefully interpreting the phenomena of the nervous system' on the living human subject; all which I hope to exemplify further when I have to consider the works of John Hunter. DR. JONES. In considering the evidence offered to the Royal Commission, nothing is more inexplicable than the absence of information as to other modes of research.

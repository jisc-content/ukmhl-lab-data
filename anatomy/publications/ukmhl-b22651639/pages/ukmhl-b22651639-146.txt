138 experimental physiology to our continental neighbours. I know of nothing which we have derived from them for many years, that I do not regret. Their absurd ministrations to some diseases, which are much more safely ministered to by scientific surgery, have only served to violate the delicacy with which one class of patients have always been treated, or to minister to the prurient and demoralizing appetencies of another. It is from these and similar views, that I beheve more men have been led to entertain such imperfect views of the relations of the beautiful science—Physiology. A science which, in its small and suggestive begin- nings, presents us with facts so plain as to be intelli- gible and interesting to the least cultivated under- standing, which are in close sympathy with our in- stincts, our feehngs, and our necessities; which, by a beautiful and gentle progression, conducts us to other facts and relations which—without in any way impugn- ing, much less dwarfing, the famihar lessons with which we commenced our studies.— invest them at every step with increasing interest and value; which, in further progress, flashes on us the startling fact that the most common of our bodily functions evince very striking connections, and exert unquestionable in- fluences on the action of the mind itself. That, thus far, a science—which may have been cultivated with no higher view than the care and safety of om^ perish- able bodies—should suggest that all the phenomena should be carefully reviewed. That new fields should now open to us, not only of bodily relations, but which require the ardent study of the philosophy of mind— and this, not on the basis of any mere metaphysical

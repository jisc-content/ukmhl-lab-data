140 ng^tural phenomenon, or evidence, of tlie healthy actions of an animal, whilst its nervous system is thus narco- tized. There are evils, too, not always inseparable from tl^e more legitimate employment of those agencies. I have known, sometimes, the most desirable and unex- pected hght thrown on the reparative power of the ceconomy, and the most splendid illustration of the superior views of Abernethy, consequent on a patient refusing—from the dread of pain—to submit to what was thought to be a necessary operation. Accidents of this kind, so to speak, must have occurred to most surgeons of experience, and with results obviously of a highly instructive character. ISTow, I fear that im- patience on the part of the patient, or, it may be, of the surgeon, has sometimes, under the comforting assur- ance of an angesthetic, led to operations, which anticipated unnecessarily the reparative processes of nature, and thus—as well as in obscm^ing from us the natural history of the disease—has been an unwelcome obstruction to a valuable scientific observation. I have thus glanced at a few of the evils of Vivisection, and the fallacies more or less connected with it. I heartily wish that we were left to the study of a beautiful science, as beneficient in its objects as it is delightful in its legitimate study; and which revolts at unnecessary sufferings, whether in man, woman, or child, or any other animal, as contrary to its principles and its scientific relations, as it is to nature, science, and morality.

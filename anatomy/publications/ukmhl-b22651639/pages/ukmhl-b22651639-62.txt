54 not so readily observed. I cannot exemplify this better than by referring to diseases, in the first place, to wliicb some Vivisectors liave dii^ected their attention. I have already cited one case in relation to the spinal marrow, where the syiivptoms were wholly referred to that part, whilst the cause lay in an organ (the liver), the functions of which are imder the influence of the sympathetic system. Again, in diseases of the heart, perhaps there is no organ in the body more fi-equently disturbed by conditions primarily occurring in other parts; nothing of this kind can be obtained by any number or variety of dissections of living animals. It is simply impossible, from such a som-ce, to elicit by experiment those phenomena which disease and dis- order—nay, even many phenomena in health—so beautifully, so teachingiy, exhibit in the living human body. The study of the correlations of diffe- rent organs, in the first place, enables us in various cases to warn and protect people from consequences •which we cannot cure, and which furnish the proofs, the truth, and justice of those warnings—painfully, it is true—but tsachingly, nevertheless, in cases wherein they arc neglected. Again, in what we term cm^e of disease, we are enabled to do more in a few days, or it may be even less, by hitting on a ]?rimarihj affected organ, than has been done in weeks—aye, I have known it even in months—^by those who have been addressing themselves to symptoms, or what is termed routine, without the smallest benefit. There are very much more serious errors which arise fi'om want of familiarity with these correlations. It is thi'ough these physiological relations that we arrive at the

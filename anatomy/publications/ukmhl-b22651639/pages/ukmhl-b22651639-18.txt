Founded on facts, truthfully stated, and flowing fi^om a reasonable and intelligible relation to such facts, it is a necessary step—a sjDecies of scaffolding essential to the construction of scientific generalisation. If simply enunciated without these conditions, it is more justly regarded, when held as a quasi imposition on your credulity; or, as one who would wish you to take on trust that which he knows or should know he ought to jDrove. I do not believe that anyone is disposed to under- yalue the discoveries of Sir Charles Bell. It is an honour to his memory that, though a teacher of anatomy, he saw the fallacy of Vivisection as a means of discovery; he was, however, so far unfortunate as to live in a time (which yet lingers on) when he could not make his discoveries credible except thi^ough the medium of the external senses.

57 anyone who will study his works, how absurd it is to trace his labours to any dissection of living animals. I used the word " gross calumny;" well, that is rather strong, but, scientifically speaking, I think it a grievous injustice to a man's memory, to whom we owe such obhgations, to associate his name with Vivisection, and to select as an example that which was demonstrably untrue. This, under many circumstances, would be unimportant, but before a Eoyal Commission a man's memory should not be so associated, and especially in aid of Vivisection, whilst our real obligations to him were not explained; and which not only exemplified better, more philosophical, and more fruitful modes of research, but which, more than anything that any- one has done, showed how superior his most matured mode of research was to that which he was only quoted to support, by the selection of a discovery falsely attributed to Vivisection, whilst the fact is that the discovery resulted from the study of phenomena which were alone to be found in the human body, and which were applied only through a careful study of the phenomena of health and disease. The thought- ful suggestions of John Hunter, in his short but laborious life, are so abundantly prolific of fruitful application — both immediate and remote — when carefully studied; that they suggest the symbol and contrast represented by the seed to the tree of the forest; whilst the endeavour to demonstrate the laws of life by dissecting living animals, seems nothing less than an attempt to supply, by the grossest species of sensuous curiosity, a substitute for the most exalted exercise of the intellectual faculties.

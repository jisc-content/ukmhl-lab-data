24 tables to expedite and facilitate more compreliensive records of phenomena. The absence of this, and the mischief resulting from it (as the reader wiU see), is acknowledged by some of our most industrious Vivisectors, as condoning or excusing investigation by Vivisection. The fact is, as I have often said, Vivisection has too commonly arisen from the investigator not having had, as the case may have been, either the pathological knowledge, the opportunity, or the industry, necessary to really philosophical pathology. Dr. Hope did cer- tainly perform experiments on^ hving animals; but it may be remarked that the experiments, which were commenced by stunning the animal by a blow on the head with a hammer, scarcely come faii'ly within what is intended by Vivisection; and I think there is some- thing of special pleading in quoting them before a Royal Commission, with a reticence which suppressed the real nature of these experiments. 'No doubt Dr. Hope performed other experiments; but, as I have observed, those which were chiefly rehed on were such as the following. " An ass, of which the pulse and ' " impulse were forty-eight in a minute, was instantly *' deprived of sensation by a smart blow on the " head. The trachea was opened, a large bellows pipe "introduced, and artificial respiration maintained; " while, at the same time, the left ribs were sawn thi'ough " near the sternum, and forcibly bent back and broken " (in order to prevent ha3morrhage from the intercostal " vessels), so as widely and completely to expose the ** heart, immediately behind the left shoulder; the "whole was accomplished in less than five minutes.

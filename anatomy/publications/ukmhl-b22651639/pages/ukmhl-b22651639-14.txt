6 a calm examination of its alleged utility, we must in justice consider some of tliose featm-es wliicli are inseparable from tliis mode of research. The Vivisec- tionist would have us believe that the knowledge of the natm-e and treatment of disease, and the practice of a Profession which walks forth with a mission of beneficence, chartered as it were by the Highest authority, can only be acquired by proceedings which, lulling our sensibility, and dwarfing for the time the most blessed attribute we have, lead us to inflict countless sufferings on animalsâ€”^beings which minister largely to om- comforts, om* necessities, om- plea- sures, and, in their relations to surrounding natm^e, present subjects of our most elevating and delightful studies. Proceedings thus alleged to be necessary are further of a character which, in the abstract, are most repulsive to the majority of mankind, and for a purpose acknowledged to be selfish, viz., the removal of evils which are almost entu'ely the results of the vices, the follies, or the ignorance of mankind. All this may be so ; there are no doubt many things which om" limited faculties do not lead us to understand, and which are "not dreamt of in om' philosophy." But I think everyone must concede that such extra- ordinary and, one would think, irreconcilable arrange- ments should not be taken on trust on the statements of mere men, and that the alleged necessity ought to be so clearly proved as to admit of no question or ambiguity. It should be a subject of more than mere scientific interest to consider how far it is possible that Vivisection, if it prove to be a wTong method, can end in a mere negative, and abandonment of it.

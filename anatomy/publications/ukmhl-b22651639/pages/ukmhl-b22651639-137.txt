Dr. Jones, in expressing his regret at the want of more accurate observation, says how mortified he had been in consulting various sources of information, in periodical and other works, to find how many opportunities—from accidents and other sources—had occurred for investigation, and yet, in some of the most instructive cases, the artery had not even been examined. Now, why was this admirable concession to the true mode of investigation not ehcited, whilst the alleged, the forced, or assumed absence of it is so often pleaded in favour of Vivi- section ? Why was it also not stated, if not to the professional, at least to the lay members of the Commission? But I do not see a word said on the subject. If Dr. Jones was quoted in favour of a mode of research of which thousands doubt the use or propriety, why was what he said in favour of a mode, the entirely unobjectionable character and superior scien- tific claims, of which no one doubts, suppressed, not ehcited, or altogether disregarded ? The frequent employment of questions more or less of a leading character, cannot, I think, be held as entirely free from objection. We do not expect, of course, that gentlemen voluntarily offering their testi- mony on a scientific subject, should be cross-examined after the manner often expedient in courts of law; but it is reasonable to require that questions should be so K

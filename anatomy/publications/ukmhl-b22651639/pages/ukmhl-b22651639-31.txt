23 logical researcli, there are no diseases wHich. are more instructive. Examined as to all their antecedents, and especially by the light of that correlation in the action of organs on which John Hunter so insisted, no diseases afford us more warning, none which enaHe us to form that prophetic prognosis (so to speak), which thus gives us oppportunity to prevent or indefinitely postpone the supervention of conditions which we are unable to cure. Were it the habit to examine diseases, as all cases should be, and I begin to think some are; their antecedents carefully recorded, their probably remote as well as their proximate causes and dependencies ; a single year, from the combined efforts of the Profession, would have afforded, not only opportunities of acquiring very accurate observations on the human subject, whilst living, but also many instances in which the interpretation of phenomena on the hving, might have been tested by examination of the dead. It is the absence of tracing all the Hnks in a chain of pathological phenomena, that has led men to that sort of confusion which confounds morbid anatomy with pathology, of which it is of course only one (however important) element. I should not venture to say as much as this, but for two reasons: the one, that I continue to see examples of imperfect investigation; and because nothing would more effectually expose the uselessness and the inferiority of Vivisection than that more careful observation and record of disease, which is still in a general sense wanting, although now not entirely without some exceptions. Many years ago, when insisting on the necessity of this, I constructed

102 â€”it was tlie practice to administer aperients for tliat purpose, and it was a long time before mj atten- tion was drawn to tliis as a most dangerous and, in fact, too fatal practice. Like all other things, the question was not free from difficulties, because if a patient applied immediately on the occurrence of the strangu- lation, and the surgeon, on failing to reduce the parts, did not delay the operation, then the bowels or other parts would probably be found in so nearly a natural state, that the relief from the bowels might occur spontaneously, or upon the administration of medicine, and yet no harm happen. So that until such cases were explained, it seemed difficult to understand the extreme fatality consequent on the use of aperients after the operation. Another difficulty in arriving at a clear view of the subject resulted from cases in which, when the operation had been performed, it was seen that the inflammation of the peritoneum had already become established; and this was regarded as a sufficient explanation of the fatal issue. We cannot always tell the exact moment when we suggest an improvement in practice ; but I recollect one case in which, having administered a mild aperient, after Mr. Abernethy's manner, that is in small doses, every three or four hours, until the effect desired, the patient, who was perfectly easy before, began, after the &st dose, as far as I remember, to be uneasy, when I instantly discontinued the medicine. Now, having cleared the cases of those which, from the healthy condition of the bowel or other parts, were calculated to obscure the subject, by furnishing in- stances where purgatives might have been administered

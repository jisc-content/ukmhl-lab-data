19 Now, I beg the reader to consider tliis statement by Harvey liimself, in connection witli the actual con- dition and the extreme simplicity of arrangement of the mechanism it was his object to examine, for I can hardly conceive anything which is more strongly suggestive of a man having actually puzzled himself by his Vivisection. If the reader does not participate in this view of the passage, let him invent a passage which he forms for the express purpose of exhibiting an investigator so puzzled, and then compare the two, as a severe test of the feasibility of the conclusion which I have ventured on drawing. But, before we quit this subject, let us apply something more authoritative than the variable manner in which this passage may be construed. A very striking and significant character in Vivisection is that this sensuous mode of investigation, which is to render things so clear, seems on every hand to present nothing more frequently than the variety of conclusions to which it has led. This brings us to a quotation very apropos to the point we are discussing, and the more as the passage comes from a writer whom some of the witnesses have quoted rather too boldly as a Vivisec- tor, and with especial reference to a series of experi- ments in which there was no Vivisection at all. I mean Dr. Hope, of whom we have yet to speak. Dr. Hope, in commenting on some erroneous conclusions of that inveterate Vivisector (M. Majendie), says : " If, " says M. Magendie, the heart of a living animal is " denuded, we easily see that the auricles and ventricles " contract 2i,n.di dilate ^].tQTn2iA,e\j.

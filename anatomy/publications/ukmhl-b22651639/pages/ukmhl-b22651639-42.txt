34 courses of remedies equally empirically applied, to the neglect of further enquiry into those parts of the ceconomy whence the mischief really proceeded. Now, I do not believe that Marshall Hall was led into this error. He was too circumspect to be blind to the various influences which it was necessary to keep in "\dew; and if his views were more or less restricted, which I do not assert, they resulted only from his having resorted to a mode of research which was unnecessary, and very inferior to that which, had it occurred to him, he was so capable of pursuing. Many years ago, I endeavoured to impress the import- ance and practical advantage of foUoAving out more fully those correlations of function so insisted on by John Hunter ; and I showed that those relations were not restricted to particular parts or to particular direc- tions ; that although the more ordinary com^se might be from A. to B., yet it might be from B. to A., or any other direction. Now this was, I contend, a much larger view of the matter, and derived from physiological and pathological facts, observed in the living human body. This led me to very important results, which, as they were really legitimate out- growths from my studies of John Hunter, I shall more fully exemplify when I treat of that author; but one case seems so pertinent to the subject treated of by Marshall Hall, that I will mention it. The pre- cepts of inductive philosophy, instruct us to en- quire and to look very much farther than the imme- 'diate object before us. Thus, supposing the subject to be muscular spasm; why, then we consider under spasm every variety we can discover, no matter how distant,

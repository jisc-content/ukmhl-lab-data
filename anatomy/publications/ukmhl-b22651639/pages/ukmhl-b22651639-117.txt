109 experimentally, but on the best judgment, on the " human subject, and proved on the human subject. " In recent times there has been more written and " said to catch the public mind than there used to be on the subject; and I have observed that frequently " certain operations in surgery have been referred to " as having been developed in consequence of experi- " ments on the lower animals. Now, John Hunter, " one of our greatest physiologists, and allowed " to be one of our greatest surgeons also, who may be ** said to this day to stand at the head of what may be " called scientific surgery in this country, is especially " celebrated for an operation which he devised on the " arteries. That operation stood for sixty or eighty years " as the most brilliant in surgery, and—in so far as I " have been able to make out (and I have enquired into " the subject)—Hunter's first experiment, if it might " be so called, was done on the human subject; and it " was long after he had repeated his op eration on the " human subject, and others had repeated it, that the " fashion of tying arteries on the lower animals origi- " nated, or was developed. That fashion was quite " justifiable at the time—^it is no longer now justifi- " able; but in regard to the surgical aspect of the " case, the experiment might have been left entirely " untouched, for Hunter had already experimented " and developed the fact on the human subject." This is quite correct, as far as the surgical aspect of the case. The experiments of Dr. Jones, as I have already shown, were only expedient or necessary, from the gross, neglect of opportunities on the human sub- ject, as he himself has stated. They were therefore, in point of fact, not justifiable at all.

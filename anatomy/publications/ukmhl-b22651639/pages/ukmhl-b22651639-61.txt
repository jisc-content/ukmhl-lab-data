JSTow, about these two simple and undeniable facts lay an important mass of consequences, which, as I contend, have been subsequently brought out by myself and, for aught I know to the contrary, by some others. I have very little doubt but that John Hunter was not wholly unaware of that for which I am about to contend, but his life was not long, his death was sudden, and his papers were burnt! Well, be that as it may, I hope some of us may obtain useful deductions from his tJioiights, and show that the germs he left may from their prolific results show how absurd, as well as unjust and misleading, it is to associate his memory with the least important things he ever did, still less to falsely refer to such experiments on animals, his really useful improvement in the treatment of aneurism. ISTow, the result of a cultivation of the phenomena of sympathy between various organs is no less than thisâ€”that the symptoms of disease in the commence- ment, and very often for a long time, are almost never the seat of the essential cause or origin of the malady. We are, of course, not speaking of accidental injuries, as wounds, fractures, etc. Multitudes of cases, in illustration, are even popularly familiar.

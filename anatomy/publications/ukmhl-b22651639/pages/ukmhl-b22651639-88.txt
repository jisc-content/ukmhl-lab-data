Asked if lie said certain things, lie said no; but he would explain what he did say, etc. Then, in the next question, he says: " I should quite be prepared to maintain that science hereafter may show that in our bodies there may be superfluous parts, reUcta of ancestral relations, which linger in us, and which (though I do not know them now) may hereafter be found to be useless, and that it is a conceivable object of science to find them out, and it might even be a *' conceivable object of practice to remove them." Asked, " Is it borne out that modifications caused by " these surgical operations are transmitted to future *' generations ? "A. I did not afi&rm that they were; but what I hinted was this. Pointing to my friends, the sur- geons, I said: ' Should advancing knowledge show ^' ' that we have superfluous parts, or organs, and *' ' especially if these are hable to disease, what a land ' of promise for operational' But that was merely " hypothetical—it was no real suggestion that the sui-- ^' geon was now to be called in. • " Q.

Now we will on this point see how far Dr. Jones himself sanctions the view I have just taken of the matter. After some very sensible remarks on the danger of hgemorrhage, the anxiety of the surgeon, and the importance of the subject, he observes that " there " are only two modes by which we are enabled to- " obtain any knowledge on these subjectsâ€”first, by *' patient observation on the human body; and, secondlyy " by direct experiments on brutes. War^ accidentSy " and disease, have never been wanting; and yet the " records of our profession afford us but few and " detached observations on the suppression of haemor- " rhage, if we contrast the knowledge we possess with " the importance of the subject. Rash conjecture " and idle hypothesis, resting on partial observation, " have usurped the place of that truth, which could '* only be discovered by a series of observations " through every stage of a process which, one would " think, claimed the strictest investigation from the *' moment that surgery became an object of individual " pursuit. The author has endeavoured to supply that " deficiency by a series of experiments on brutes; that is to say, a deficiency consequent on the neglect of careful observation and record of the opportuni- ties which have never been wanting from wars^ accidents, and disease ; to which we may add, par excellence, surgical operations. He further states *' that he does not presume that his experiments afford " an unerring guide to the corresponding changes in tha

128 Thus implying that, x>ro tanto, Vi^dsection was necessary or vindicable on account of the alleged im- possibility of arriving at the fact by any other means. Now, the idea of taking so sweeping an assertion, which, at one jump of mere ojmiion, practically gauges, as it were, the miiltifarious resources of pathological physiology, and on a matter the subject of controversy, seems to me to be altogether irreconcileable with that elaborate accuracy which sbould characterize so im- portant an enquiiy. Now let us look at the matter in the light of inexorable facts. In all judicial enquiries, wbere a single life is concerned, nothing can exceed the care, the circumspection, or the reliance on facts alone. In regard to right or wrong methods of pliysiological or pathological investigation, it is no exaggeration to say that hundreds of lives may be sacri- ficed or saved, as the one or other path is chosen. Even these observations—fragmentary and imperfect as tbey are—have furnished proofs of that assertion. In further pursuit of this subject, evidence ui favom' of Vivisectional experiments had been given as derived fi^om the works of those who, so far fi^om pleading the necessity of experiments on brutes from any intrinsic difficulty in regard to the questions which they desire to solve, avowed and excused the necessity of their mode of research, not from any intrinsic difficulty, or fi'om there not having been other means, but from the fact that, although superior opportunities had been offered in the human subject, they had been allowed to pass entirely unexamined—^in fact, in a pathological sense, shamefully neglected. I am here referring not only, but chiefly, to the work of Dr. Jones on

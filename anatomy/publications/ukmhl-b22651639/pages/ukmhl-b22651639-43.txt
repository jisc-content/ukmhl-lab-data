36 how unlike, tlie occurrence may be, either as regards the degree, the patient, or any other accompaniment; because, in pursuing a subject to obtain an insight into a common character, we sometimes find that io one case the circumstances may appear very mys< terious, whilst in another they are very simple. Now. in aid of illustration, I will endeavour to chip off, as it were, a piece from a great subject, and say a few words about that most afflicting action of muscular structures, and the practical relation of the case to the nervous system (Tetanus, or locked jaw). A man had a small abscess on his finger, of which he took no notice, until he was somewhat suddenly seized with tetanus. This induced Dr. Golding Bird (at that time my colleague) to refer him to me. Dr. Bird expected that I should at once have opened the abscess, but this I declined to do, for the following reasons: I thought it probable that the man might have had many trifling accidents to his fingers before, but he had never had Tetanus. It appeared clear that there must be some link between the abscess and the tetanus, which was not represented by either. Many common cases, as worms, etc., occm- in children, and others, of disorders of the voluntary muscles, in which the symptoms are clearly referable to disturbances in organs more or less under the influence of the sympathetic system. I enquired particularly about the patient's antecedents, his em- ployments, his habits, the diseases he might have had, and what he might know of his blood relations; and all the other points suggested in my Tables of induction, which I constructed many years ago.

44 in the treatment of aneurism, in the first place. It is tedious to have to refute statements whicli have been so often refuted already; but I know not what is to be done, if persons are found who will recklessly continue to assert what is demonstrably untrue. An aneurism is a disease which occurs in one of the vessels called arteries, through which the blood is sent forth from the heart to all parts of the body. Now these vessels, or tubes, are subject to disease. The tube sometimes becomes enlarged; but that is not the disease I am about to describe. In what we regard as aneurism, the inner coat, or lining, of the tube is ruptured, or gives way, and then the blood, being impelled against the outer coat, gradually distends it, and thus forms a tumour. This tumour becomes gradually filled by layers of the more solid parts of the blood, and thus pressing on the artery, as well as any adjacent struc- ture, in some degree diminishes the impetus of the blood through the vessel. This has a tendency to produce a natural cure, which sometimes actually takes place, thus : the blood, somewhat impeded in its usual course, flows more or less through collateral channels ; and the diseased artery, rendered thus less pervious to the current of the blood, gi-adually becomes obliterated, and thus we have what is called the spontaneous, or natural, cure of an aneurism. Affairs, however, do not often go on so desirably; on the contrary, the constant impetus of the blood produces a gradual enlargement of the tumour, which, if nothing be done, ultimately gives way, and the patient dies from haemorrhage. So much for the disease which, hke all pathological

95 his attention confined to tlie apparently naked condi- tion of tlie neck of tlie bone. That this accident was frequently repaired by ligamentous union was true, but it was not the only part where accidents were repaired by ligamentous union; nay, more, it was known that sometimes surgeons, after a while, purposely allowed some degree of motion in fractured bones, where they feared that the secretion of bone might be in inconve- nient excess, and where ligamentous union took place. Besides, he knew that this fracture took place most commonly in persons advanced in hfe, when unusual care is necessary as regards the utmost quiet of the hmb, so that no disturbance should occur in parts which it was essential to keep in apposition, and that various circumstances rendered this, in many cases, a matter of no small difficulty. JSTow, all this might be said to apply, more or less, to fractures in general, but it seems to have been lost sight of, or unappreciated, by Sir Astley. He had got the one idea of deficient reparative power, and seems to have referred failure to nothing else. Well, to prove this, as he thought, he made some experiments on animals; and here is another feature common in Vivisection. A supposition is started, contrary or irreconcileable with many known facts, or to some obvious analogy, and then an animal is experimented on to see if it be true. So that, in a vast number of cases, a man commences his experi- ment, as Sir Astley did, with the disadvantage of a foregone conclusion. He accordingly experimented on dogs; and finding that the fractures he made in the thighs of the dogs united only by ligament, he re- garded that as a confirmation of his doctrine. Now, I

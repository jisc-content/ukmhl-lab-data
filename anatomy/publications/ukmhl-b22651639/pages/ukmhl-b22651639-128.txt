120 tlie animal must be alive, althougli liis words do not necessarily convey tlie latter inference; there is perhaps something significant of it, when he says: "Sen- *^ smim Veritas, et evidentia prae omni ratione est;" and, again, " Anatomicus non nisi oculis suis credere debet." It seems to me that Vivisectors of all times, and on all subjects, seldom fail to combine with any conclusion that is proximately sound, sufficient of that which is false, to convey the idea that Vivisection always tends to more or less mislead the investigator. M. Claude Bernard is regarded, I beheve, as the most active Yivisector at this time, and it will be a very service- able contribution to the whole subject, if a careful analysis of his loliole hnown proceedings be published. This—if some of the large number who are opposed to Vivisection will adopt the plan I shall submit in the conclusion—may be easily done, as it will admit of an indefinite division of labour, and keep up not only the question itself before the public, but, what is still better, enable almost any person of ordinary education to form an opinion on the merits of the various cases. I here can only insert a few remarks, which may help the reader to form some idea of the style of reasoning adopted by so well-known an experimenter. I remarked on the following experiment some years ago, in my reply to the French Commission. I do not think I can now select any one more striking of the questionable reasoning of a Vivisector. The experi- ment consists of dissecting down to the pancreas, or sweetbread, of a living animal (in this case a dog), to obtain the secretion from that gland, by means of- the establishment of a fistulous opening.

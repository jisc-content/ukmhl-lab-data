62 to tlie modest and diffident manner in wliicTi tlie " author speaks of a fact wliicli was well-nigh conclu' sive as to the truth of his doctrine. A beautiful representation of the pustule, in an advanced stage, " is given on the second plate of the enquiry. The " character of the pustule is so correct, as to excite " some surprise that it has been so little attended to, " etc." Well, now we come to an.experiment on this point: " Mr. Tanner inoculated a cow's teat with some matter taken from the heel of the horse, and " produced a vaccine pustule." As a collateral fact this may not be without interest, but it had. nothing to do with the discovery which was, as Jenner him- self shows, based on observation. Now, by what latitude of interpretation this can be stated as the basis of Jenner's discovery, let the reader imagine. He will not find it in Jenner's " Enquiry," nor in Dr. Baron's life, nor anywhere else, that I know of, except in the evidence before the Royal Commission. Dr. Jenner, in his evidence before a Committee in the House of Commons, in the year 1802, said—" My ^' enquiry into the nature of the cow pox commenced *' upwards of twenty-five years ago. My attention to this " singular disease was first excited by observing that " among those whom I was frequently called on to in- " oculate, many resisted every attempt to give them " the small-pox. These patients, I found, had under- gone a disease they called cow pox, contracted by milking cows, affected with a peculiar eruption on " their teats. On enquiry, it appeared it had been " known among the dairies time immemorial, and that •** a vague opinion prevailed that it was a preventive of " the small pox."

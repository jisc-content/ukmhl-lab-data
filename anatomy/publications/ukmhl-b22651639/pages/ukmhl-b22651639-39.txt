31 rendered his experiments altogether unnecessary; this we may more plainly show as we proceed. I wish I had space or time to make an analysis of Dr. Marshall Hall's works as they deserve; but I have over and over asrain declared that nothino- less than an elaborate course of lectures would enable any one fully to demonstrate how unnecessary is Vivisection. I cannot forego stating one case of Dr. Marshall Hall's. Having removed the head of a frog, and suspended the animal by means of a ligature round the toes, the animal remained motionless " until he " pinched the skin in various parts, which produced " forcible muscular action, and then the elongated " form was resumed as before." He then performed the same experiment on a snake, with " precisely " similar results.

But we have still more positive facts *' in cases of Injury of the Spinal Marrow in the human " subject." He then relates a case sent him by Mr. W. F. Barlow, of Writtle, Essex, in proof.

9 Question.—Altliougli you have never performed any experiments, nor witnessed them, you have used the results of the experiments of others, have you not, as the lasis for the advance of your professional knowledge ? Answer.—I have made myself acquainted with the experiments and their results, and have turned them to such uses as I could. Could any answer convey a more measured recog- nition of a mode of study in reply to the question whether he had not made it a hasis for the advance- ment of his professional knowledge ? Could anything he more vague or unsatisfactory ? Why was so experienced a witness not requested to favour the Commission with some of the details of so vast an experience ? Why not requested to state in luhat cases he had tiu-ned it to account, and how far it had or had not answered his expectations ? I must think that allowing so experienced a witness to limit his information to such a vague generality was losing or not seehing practical information from one who, of all others, may he reasonably supposed to have been most able to supply it; and therefore suggestive of a very unsatisfactory and by no means painstaking examination.

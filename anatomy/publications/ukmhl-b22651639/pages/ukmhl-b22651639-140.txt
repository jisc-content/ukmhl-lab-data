When I had the honour of being on the Board of Managers, I ventured to suggest that light, though physiologically considered, should be regarded at first with that larger grasp, which would glance at its more extended functions in the surrounding world of nature, in its relation to its physical and chemical functions or agencies, and the somewhat larger and circumspective view thus obtained should have its light focalized on the subject, the more immediate object of enquiryâ€”the eye, its ana- tomy, and its functions; but I failed to impress the importance of such views, though they were not alto- gether without some indications of sympathy; but they appeared to be regarded as too difficult to secure a competent discussion of them. No physiologist, that I have ever heard, has discussed the subjects of hght and vision, but in so restricted a manner as to exclude some of the most beautiful points on these interesting subjects.

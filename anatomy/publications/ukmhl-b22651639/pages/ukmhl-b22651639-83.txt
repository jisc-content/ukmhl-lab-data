I do not believe tliat there is a single statement in tlie two preceding answers wliicli I cannot shew to be either absolutely incorrect or of a most misleading character. • Of Harvey we have akeady shewn that the discovery of the circulation was not the result or the effect of Vivisection. So it is not necessary to consider the somewhat sweeping assertion that physicians before that time knew nothing of dropsical affections or enlaro-ement of the liver. We have seen cases which suggest that there is a good deal yet to learn on that subject; transfusion is mentioned as a remedy for haemorrhage, as if it were an ordinary and well-estab- hshed fact. How many times has it proved suc- cessful ? We have shown that Marshall Hall took a circuitous route to establish wh.at he himself showed could only be rendered certain by his own reference to the human subject; and we showed that the practice of surgery in removing parts—not teeth merely, but whole limbs —on the supposition that the local mischief was the cause, had ended in failures so often, as to be, if not abandoned, as in cases of tetanus, tic doloreux, etc., hardly ever instituted.

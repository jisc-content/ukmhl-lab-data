96 ■will venture to say tliat not one of the circumstances necessary to the proper repair of the fractured neck of the thigh bone in the human subject, could be accom- plished in the dog, and especially that chief of all, the continually undisturbed condition of the injured parts. Now many surgeons, both here and on the Continent, took another view of the subject, and maintained that if the parts were kept perfectly still, and so maintained for the requisite time, that the fractured neck of the thigh bone would do just as well as others. Amongst these were Mr. Abernethy and Baron Larrey. But those cases which were successful, were for a time met by the allegation that the fractures were outside, or partially outside, of the capsule or bag of the joint; and as this could not be proved or disproved but by dissec- tion, much time—even years—passed away, during which the subject was a matter of opinion. At length cases were so remarked and recorded, that opportuni- ties occurred after death, and permission was obtained to examine the joint, when the practicability of bony union of the fracture in question was fully established. There were two or three examples occurred about the same time; but I think the fost undoubted specimen occurred to a very good and industrious pathologist (Mr. Langstaff), and is possibly now in the College of Surgeons, as many of the most valuable of Mr. Langstaff's preparations were, I think, bought by the College at his decease. Now, if the reader is not fatigued with this narrative, I beg his particular attention to what follows. Sir Astley Cooper was surgeon to one of the largest hospitals, and a leading teacher of Surgery.

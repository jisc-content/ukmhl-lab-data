71 the duodenum (the bowel into which the hver pours the bile). This jou may accomplish by one of two methodsâ€”either by giving your remedy by very small and repeated doses, so as to represent an interval of many hours before you obtain the action desired; or by combining mercurial or any other medicine you prefer, in larger doses, with small additions of some sedative, or larger additions of an aromatic. In con- sulting practice, I said, perhaps the small doses of aperients prove the more convenient, unless you are seeing the patient every day, because it is not always possible to hit at once the respective doses of sedative and the excitant in any one case; but the effect of the first prescription, if it does not answer yom* intention, will generally guide you as to the desired relative proportions. There are, however, a great many advan- tages arising out of this view. It will enable you, by the assistance of any sedative or aromatic, to convert almost any aperient into an excitant of the liver, and "will thus, when sent for into the country, prove to be a very efficient addition to yom' means, by enabling you to employ what you may find in the cupboard or the family medicine chest, as the case may be. The investigations, however, to which I have been thus led, have brought out some very curious results, some of which have been pubhshed in my works, and which throw entirely new lights on the actions of mercury and other things, proving that they do not produce what are usually considered their specific effects, as mercury, etc., but in virtue of a quasi poison, suggesting a most impor- tant generalization, and which I shall not live long enough, I dare say, to work out, but the first step of

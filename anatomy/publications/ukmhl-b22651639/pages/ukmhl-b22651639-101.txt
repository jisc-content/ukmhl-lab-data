93 sion, on the ground (as alleged) that he was known to be an advocate of Vivisection. I said certainly, for the reason that some one holding such alleged opinions would be there to put forth their strong reasons, and have them answered; but then I took it for granted that there should be other members who were capable of appreciating other views, or examining pathological or other relations to the questions which might be the subject of consideration. When I shall contend, at the close of my remarks, that the Commission was not happily constitutedâ€”I must not be understood as in any way presuming to express any dissatisfaction with the noble chairman, or the courtesy with which he conducted the enquiries; for there must have been, I presume, a very considerable reliance on his part, with regard to physiological matters, on the profes- sional portion of the Commission. Those who are opposed to Vivisection do not re- strict their objections to alleging that it is useless, or as occupying the place of more philosophical modes of research, or the suffering it necessarily involves, how- ever much that may be modified in some cases by anaesthetics; they also allege that experiments on living animals have been misleading, and so productive of great practical mischief. Of this last allegation there is not the smallest doubt, and this I must endeavour to show; not but that it has been done already, but those who advocate Vivisection seem to disregard any- thing that militates against the mode of study they advocate. The illustrations I select are from the works of Sir Astley Cooper and Mr. Travers, both men most popular in their day, and both surgeons of hospitals.

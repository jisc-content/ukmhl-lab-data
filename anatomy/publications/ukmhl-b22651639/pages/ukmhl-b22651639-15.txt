7 I have no idea of any proceeding in science ending in a mere negative ; time at all events is wasted, if not ill employed. As curses are said to fly homeward, it may possibly occur to some that a calm contemplation of the actual state of medical science may, as an abstract proposition, suggest doubts whether we are quite in the right way, and that although Yi^dsection be not the only, it may prove the most misleading, exemplification of it. For my part, I do not dissemble my regret at seeing so beautiful a branch of science, suggesting the highest qualities of head and heart, so largely charged with conjecture; so encumbered, as I think, with such an army of parasites, the potency and grasp so narrowed or distracted by endless s]3ecialisms ; and its high station too often marred by connections suggestive of commercial appe- tency, which should be as unknown as it is unworthy a great Profession; which, however, has a Palladium which condones its shortcomings, in ministering gratuitously more largely to suffering humanity than any other class of mankind; and which, I trust, will continue to preside over its earnest and too often thankless labours, and protect it from desecration, by the misapplication of talents, however well-intentioned they may be, until a time when a more philosophical cultivation of it shall indefinitely extend its unques- tioned utility, and raise it to the high place in philosophy which becomes its exalted functions, and which it once enjoyed.

62 the ultimate results, but whicli has already produced wliat I shall contend is tlie real basis of scientific sur- geryâ€”and not merely so, but the basis of a more posi- tive medical science. If Abernetby's improvements have not yet been fully developed, it is in great measure because be bas been misunderstood and, what is still worse, misrepresented; but truth has the property, in time, of penetrating the darkest recesses, and accordingly we see (very imperfect, it may be, but still practical) recognitions of those views so essential to all rational practice, whether of surgery or medi- cine, which it was Abernethy's object to enforce. Abernethy, however, grasping at a general result of Hunter's views, left many relations of those corre- lations of functions it was Hunter's object to expose, unappHed, and I do not observe that they had been carried out, or even observed, by Hunter, although they are the necessary outgTOwths of that which he did discover and remark on. Some of his remarks, however, show that he had not as yet observed theu' more extended relations, which, I infer from his speaking of things as quasi exceptions, are un- doubtedly more like, if not entirely the rule. In this there is a striking similarity in Mr. Boodle's first correspondence with Abernethy, and John Hunter's quasi exceptional examples. Mr. Boodle, in writing to Abernethy, observed that he had seen cases in which the organ principally disordered had not evinced it by any of the usual, or any symptoms, or something to that effect. John Hunter, as I have already remarked, said that the sympathiser was often more affected than the part with which it was sympa-

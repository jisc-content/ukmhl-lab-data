At this period I also gave cUnical lec- tures on surgery, which, as far as I know, were the first regular clinical lectures on surgery in London.

Under these advantages I naturally enough tried to improve, so far as I could, anything which I had derived from these opportunities. Now, strangulated hernia was a particularly serious affair; too many of the cases in which, as it appeared to me and another surgeon—one afterwards surgeon to the hospital—the majority terminated unfavour- ably. Many of these were due to the late period at which the patients had applied; the protruded parts had already undergone changes, which involved dangers altogether apart from any necessary to the operation.

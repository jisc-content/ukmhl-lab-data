28 may suggest that it is not an auspicious mode o£ researcli, it is no proof that it must necessarily, on that ground only, prove unproductive. There is, too, no need of anything like special pleading, to show that Vivisection is a mistake—that it is wholly unproduc- tive ; or where it tends to prove anything useful, the necessity of it is superseded by superior modes of investigation. I must not close the few remarks which I have to offer on Dr. Hope, without some reference to the treatment, l^ow, on this subject, there are many judicious observations, and I do not perceive (had I seen the cases) that I should have with- held my general concurrence; but now comes the test. I do not see one single point of real lyractical value, which any well-informed surgeon would not have arrived at without any Vivisection, or which could stand instead of more unequivocal information other- wise required, and by more legitimate means. In serious diseases we hke large comprehensive views, whence alone we derive the real value of details. In such, it matters little that a man should say, " ISfo, " Sir, that which you consider the second sound arises ** from the valves, and not fi'om the som^ce to which you " refer it." This suggests to me what Abernethy once replied to a man, who said, " I don't know, but I " think, Su% you have got a slight touch of argina.'* " Very well," said Abernethy; " but I should thank " you much more if you would inform me how I am to " get rid of it." I need scarcely add that in Dr. Hope's book, the cases in the human subject which he gives are as interesting, instructive, and honourable evidence of careful observation, as his experiments on animals were inconclusive or unnecessary.

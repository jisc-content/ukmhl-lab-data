From a more than ordinary portion escap- ing, or some other cause, the aperture causes a con- striction on the contents which have been thus pro- truded, and if these are any portion of the bowels, of com^se the passage of the canal becomes obstructed. Very soon a series of unpleasant and alarming symp- toms supervene; these I need not particularly describe. It is sufficient to observe that they combine usually more or less sickness, pain, or tenderness of the part, and obstruction of the bowels. The object of the surgeon is, of course, to free the protruded parts from the constriction formed by the aperture through which they have been protruded. This he attempts either by such measures as he thinks may relax the parts, or by enlarging the aperture by the knife; and this con- stitutes what is called the operation for strangulated hernia. This operation, which is somewhat delicate in exceptional cases, is, on the whole, very simple, consisting in a verij careful exposure of the parts protruded, and a slight enlargement of the aperture through which they have been so. Perhaps there is no subject on which there has been more mischievous writing than on this. Various measures have been at different periods recommended, scarcely any one of them entirely free from objection, especially as regards the delay to which they (more or less) have given rise. For it should be remembered that when any portion of the contents of the abdomen are thus strangulated, you can never be certain that even a single hour may H 2

I will give a result or two from my own facts. Saliva- tion, held so characteristic of mercury, can be equally effected by many other things, as aloes for one; and this, again, has been first suggested to me by bedside observation of sahvation, produced by diseased condi-- tions, where no medicine of any kind had been taken.

46 on animals, but well ascertained facts from the patlio- logy of anem^sms which occurred in the human body, and which are seldom, that I know of, ever seen in animals. The treatment suggested by these facts was very simple, viz., to place the ligature higher up, that is, nearer the source of the circulation, where it might be reasonably hoped that the artery was sound. Now, there are very many people who do not reason on facts, as John Hunter did, and who found their opinions on their imaginations or their wishes. Accordingly, John Hunter had to undergo that sort of ordeal which every man has more or less to suffer, who dares to oppose conventional errors. One rather formidable class of opponents said that the disease was not restricted to the anemismal artery, but that the arteries were generally affected; and, if a case were found in which there were diseased depositions in the arteries, which sometimes happens, there was the diffi- culty of showing that it had no necessarij relation to aneurism. The question being whether, as a local aneurism, the disease was or was not extended to the neighbouring part of the tube. A somewhat dis- agreeable controversy followed; but at length the truth prevailed, and one of the greatest improve- ments in operative sm^gery became established. Now, were John Hunter alive, I think nothing in the whole controversy would have annoyed him more than to hear it said that he discovered this improve- ment by experiments on living animals. Let us consider then what John Hunter did with regard to living ani- mals, as a just preliminary to the recording of the greater

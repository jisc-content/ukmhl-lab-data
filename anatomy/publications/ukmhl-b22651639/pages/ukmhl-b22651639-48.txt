The experiments were carefully made, and, as regards their object and result, judi- ciously and modestly put forth, in a tone which invites respectful attention. He showed the kind of ligature best adapted for tying an artery; that when an artery was so tied, the internal coat was divided; that fi'om these divided surfaces lymph was poured out which, assisted by the formation of a clot of blood, constituted the means by which the further bleeding was prevented.

Now, the ivhole of this might not have been absolutely new in practice, but that is immaterial to om' present object. Dr. Jones, in the work we are considering, corrected various erroneous suppositions which the imagination had so frequently substituted for facts, and which have so often supphed either the illegiti- mate grounds, or the inadmissible excuses for Vivi- section.

133 that, in familiarizing* liim with the dissection of a living animal, it may enable him to acquire more coolness and self-possession in operating on the human subject. If this idea, when it first was presented to me, had not been from the published opinion of a surgeon, I sliould hardly have believed it could come from a professional man. I dare not express myself in the terms which appear to me alone applicable to this low, contemptible, and debasing idea of the attributes of an operating surgeon. In the first place, as an operating surgeon, I must reject the idea as a barbarous substitute. Vivi- section may brutalize a man, so as to render him an unfeeling operator. That may be; but a man who has no better guard than this, will evince its inadequacy on^ the very first difficulty he has to encounter; he will, either do something very wrong, or make some great mistake. I have seen as many operations as most people, and I speak from what I know; but it is a curious thing that the best illustration that I could wilhngly give, is from the practice of one of those who used the very argument of which I am endeavour- ing to show the fallacy. He was performing an opera- tion—in itself one simple enough, provided that a man is prepared with the well-known cautions, which I have elsewhere pointed out—but, something occming which was not necessary, he became confused, and the result was such (as alleged) an unwarrantable prolongation of the patient's suffering, that the case became the subject of an action at law.* The real sources of cool- ness and self-possession are very different from any Surgical Commentaries on Lithotomy.

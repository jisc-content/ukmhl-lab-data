56 than is necessary to sketch some of the outgrowths of the thoughts of John Hunter, which have germinated in other soils, and in the hands of less distinguished cultivators; but which encourage the confidence and foster the hopes of less gifted enquirers, that the laws of nature lie open to that industry and common sense, of which the inductive philosophy is the directing grammar, and that, whilst the field is represented by a multitude of facts furnished by health and disease—the instruments by which they are to be interpreted are industry and common sense—the greatest obstacles, prejudice and Vivisection. Already that correlation of parts which lights up the cloud formed by a mere symptomatology, is opening new paths to the explana- tion of affections of the brain, in which the primary disturbance has arisen from the violation of physiologi- cal laws, and the disturbance of the brain fi'om its sympathy with some other organ. Any one organ may so far disturb the brain, as to weaken its powers of resistance to any class of impressions, and thus lay it open to that worst of all inflictions, insanity; where the failure is referred to some recent impression or calamity, when the impotence to resist it lay in the previous diminution of its normal power, through the reflected distm^bance of some bodily organ. T wote of this nearly forty years ago. I have lived to see the general truth recognised, and never so emphatically as by a physician, whose practice was almost entirely devoted to the treatment of the insane.

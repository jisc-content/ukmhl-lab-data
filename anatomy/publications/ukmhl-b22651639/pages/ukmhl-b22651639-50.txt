42 tlie general object was to assimilate those which he had observed to those described as occuiTing in the human subject. He says : " In justice to the accuracy " of Messrs. Petit and Morand, as a proof of the exact " agreement between these observations in the human " subject and those which have been made in the " course of these experiments on brutes, I have great " pleasm-e in giving the following interesting quota- " tions relating to the permanent means of suppressing " hgemorrhage, by the effusion of lymph, or the forma- " mation of a coagulum of lymph." In contending that these experiments were un- necessary, I can add nothing to that which Dr. Jones has himself observed, and regretted. The practice of surgery in the cases which Dr. Jones has himself mentioned, present frequent opportunities of ascer- taining all the facts connected with the hgature of arteries. To these many more might be added, but scarcely any more teaching than amputation, whether successful or otherwiseâ€”especially, however, the latter, when necessarily, arteries of different sizes are usually the subject of hgature. It is to this that Grooch refers, in the passage quoted by Dr. Jones, construc- tively in support of his views, when he (Grooch) con- cludes by saying, " which work of natm^e is pretty " evident on the shm^." (p. 78.) Had these and other cases been investigated, and then' instructive phenomena recorded, they would in a single year have fm-nished to the united observations of English surgeons alone, facts, in number, variety, and grounds of safe conclu- sion, far more valuable in every scientific sense than any amount of experiments on animals whatever.

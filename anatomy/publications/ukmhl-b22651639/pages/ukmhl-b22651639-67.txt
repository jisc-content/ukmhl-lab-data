59 as to the experiments wliich they call experiments on li^dng animals. Always begging the reader to bear in mind the real objects oi the Royal Commission, I objected to those experiments of Dr. Hope's being called Vivisectional, which were preceded by a blow on the brain with a hammer, which destroyed the sensibility of the animal; not, indeed, but that they were open to objection for other reasons, but not on the received sense of Vivisection. Further, let us hear Mr. Turner.

He observed that cows â€¢ " had occasionally a pustular eruption on the udder ; " that those who milked cows so affected contracted pustules on their hands ; and that such persons " enjoyed an immunity from small-pox.'' This is per- fectly true; but where is there anything about experi- ments on living animals? The above statement was really the basis, and, with the exception of the actual -inoculation of the boy Phipps, the onhj thing necessary to the whole success of his discovery. But, once more, to quote Mr. Turner.

Jenner observed that " those cows which had their udders affected had

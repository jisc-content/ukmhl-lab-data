My reward was being told, with what truth I cannot vouch, that the chief reason why I was not selected to a professorship —^for which there were several other unsuccessful can- didates—was, that I had given popular lectures on physiology; and yet twenty years afterwards, I found that one of the desiderata of the time was a popular kuowledge of physiology, and this from the Chair of the Royal Society. Let the opposers of Vivisection be calm and patient, but persevering. The thin edge of the wedge is inserted. A cheap periodical calmly con- ducted, having for its object a description and scientific discussion of claims of every experiment, would in a few years show on which side the truth lies, and inaugu- rate that more careful observance, study, and interpre- tation of phenomena, of which some of us have for years pleaded in vain.

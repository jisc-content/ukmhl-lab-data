18 ligible liglit over the labours of Harvey. The import- anoe of the solution deducible from it was unperceived by Fabricius, but was at once recognised by his illus- trious pupil. This view, I think, independently of all other cn^cumstances, is constructively deducible fi^om the writings of Harvey himself. We will take the very passage which the pro-Vivisection witness himself selected. Let us see, then, what Harvey himself says. *'When I first gave my mind to Vivisection as a means to discovering the motions and uses of the *'heart, and sought to discover them by actual msjpec- *' Hon, and not from the writings of others, I found the *' task so truly arduous, so full of difficulties, that I " was almost tempted to think with Fracastorius, that "the motion of the heart was only to be comprehended *' by Grod; for I could neither rightly perceive at fii'st "when the systole, and when the diastole, took place; "nor when and where dilatation and contraction occulted, by reason of the rapidity of the motion, "which in many animals is accompHshed in the twink- " ling of an eye, coming and going like a flash of hght- " ning, so that the systole presented itself now fi'om this " point, now from that. The diastole the same. Then " everything was reversed; the motions occurring, as it " seemed, variously and confusedly together. My mind •" was therefore greatly unsettled; nor did I know what " I should myself conclude, nor what believe from ■" others. I was not surprised that Andreas Lauren- "tius should have said that the motion of the heart "was as perplexing as the flux and reflux of the " Euripus had appeared to Aristotle."

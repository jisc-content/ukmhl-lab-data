It is probable that his object rel-ated to injuries of these parts, under what- ever varieties of circumstances they might have been inflicted; but there is httle doubt that his enquiries were directed in an especial degree to the treatment of strangulated hernia. To say nothing of the paramount importance of that subject, the great fatality by which it was too often characterized, the title of his book suggests the prominence that strangulated hernia held in his enquiries. This was the subject which I men- tioned in my evidence before the Commission, when I was courteously reminded that it was not a medical Committee. Therefore, as I am now writing to the medical and general public in common, I must be excused from entering into the subject rather more minutely, perhaps, than my professional readers may think necessary.

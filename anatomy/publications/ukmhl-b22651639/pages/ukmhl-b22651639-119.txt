Ill every man is acquainted witli, that he investigated " by experiments on living lower animals, partly with. â– ** a view of developing features in reference to the human subject, but more, in fact, with regard to *' physiology than with regard to practical surgery; and I, myself, have a strong opinion that such an expression coming from Mr. Syme (and he must *' have passed the middle period of hfe at that time) *' ivas a mature and valuable opinion. " Q. 1037. We have been told that, speaking *' generally, experiments of this kind are performed *' with the greatest possible consideration for the " animal, and with the greatest indisposition to inflict, *' at least, protracted suffering. Do you believe that *' to be the case ? " A. Gentlemen may fancy that, but I do not think *' that they fulfil that idea. Indeed, I have reason to *' imagine that such sufferings, incidental to such *' operations, are protracted in a very shocking *' manner. I will give you an illustration of an " animal being crucified for several days, perhaps in- *' troduced several times into a lecture room, for the *' class to see how the experiment was going on. " Q, In reference to the Society for the Suppres- " sion of Cruelty to Animals, are you aware that the " present Cruelty to Animals Act is not supposed to apply to these experiments, because of the definition *' of animal ? " A. Yes, I am aware of that feature. " Q. Do you see any objection to enlarging that *' definition, so as to include wild animals ? " A. It would be a great advantage, I think, so *' to do.

79 because an infringement of them would be regarded as a violation of tliat which is essential to the dignity of the bar. Now is it possible that any one, ridden as we are by various kinds of conventionalism, can be influenced by such reasoning as that to which I have referred, although it comes from a gentleman who is well-known as a popular physician and, as I believe, a well-intentioned and good man ? I am far from agreeing with Sir "William Gull in these fears. I yield to no man in my admiration of our glorious profession, or in the general respect and regard which I bear to the many estimable men to whom its duties have been confided; but for that very reason, I would welcome any regulation which placed restrictions either on questionable modes of scientific en- quiry, or in relation to the observance of conduct which, whether on professional or other relations, should not as strictly represent that of gentlemen, as it should be unmarred by any admixture of any thing conveyed by the term esprit du corps, or professional etiquette, which could not be identified with the highest principle in morals. We need not remark on what Sir Wilham Grull says of Vaccination ; we have already pointed out the mistakes of the evidence on that subject, in which Sir William Grull seems to follow suit. Nothing seems to me to be more teaching in Sir William GruU's evidence, than the example it affords of how far a man maybe misledby a dominant idea, however opp osed it may be to the ordinary rules and cautions necessary to scien- tific research ; but the further remarks of Sir Wilham we will not yenture to discuss, more than by copying one part of the evidence, as anyone may, we should think, estimate its worth without assistance.

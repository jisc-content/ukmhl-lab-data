and the corresponding action thereby excited. That the safety of almost all medicines lies in the efficient, however gradual, expulsion of them; and unless this end be secured, minute doses may easily become sources of the most serious mischief. The facts leading me to this sort of (distant still, no doubt) approach to a generalization, have been slowly gathered from the study of an infinite number of phenomena in the living, and tested, whenever opportunity offered, by the dead, but never by a single Vivisection. SIR WILLIAM GULL. I have not space to say much on the evidence offered by Sir William Gull, and I the less regret it because for the most part it is either irrelevant, or such as most people, whether lay or professional, may be able to answer or estimate without any instruction, from me. But not to pass over without some specimen of that which really relates to the subject of the enquiry, I will quote the following: " Q. May I ask you, as a great physician, whether " you can enumerate to us any considerable number of " therapeutic remedies which have been discovered by " this process of Vivisection ? " A. The cases bristle around us everywhere; our " knowledge of dropsical affections, of pulmonary ** apoplexy, of enlargement of the liver, and the whole " category of such affections, was due to ^ Harvey's " discovery of the circulation.* We knew nothing '* about them before; knowing, therefore, their causes. * Which, as we have already shewn, was not due to Vivisection.

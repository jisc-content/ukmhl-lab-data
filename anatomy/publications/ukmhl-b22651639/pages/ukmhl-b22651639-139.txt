131 with regard to structures, wliere the presence of blood could not be demonstrated to the eye. In my early days, it was not uncommon to hear it inferred that a part was not organised, because the vessels could not be demonstrated by injection. This Mr. Abornethy was accustomed to ridicule, saying that if the organi- sation of the part could not be demonstrated to the eye, it was luminously evident to the understanding. He meant from the changes which the part was capable of undergoing. In fact, the demonstration of structure (anatomy), which was, of course, a matter of sight, was applied to the solution of a series of phenomena, in regard to the real understand- ing of which sight was of no avail, because they could only be really appreciated by the intellect. This ten- dency to seek the real nature of function through the peculiarities of material structure is still seen, and perhaps never more so than in the very useful, but some- what excessive attention to, or interest in, minute ana- tomy; but it does little or nothing to advance positive physiology ; for it has no scientific relation to it, except in the sense that the apparatus of the chemist has to the demonstration of the questions in which he is engaged. Microscopic anatomy, however, has the negative property of disabusing people from conclu- sions which they are too ready to form from the un- assisted eye. It is to the tendency to a too anatomical point of view that I attribute the character of the physiological lectures at the Royal Institution. They have been generally given by eminent men; but they have been, in my view, rather an anatomical narrative of certain detail in the adaptation of the parts to their K 2

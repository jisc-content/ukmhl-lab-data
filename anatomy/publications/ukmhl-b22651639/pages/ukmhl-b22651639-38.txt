30 axiomatic approaclies thereto, wliicli render many curious phenomena very simple and intelligible. Dr. Marshall Hall's experiments were chiefly intended to show that there were actions emanating from the Spinal marrow, induced by impressions on the more or less distant peripheral branches of nerves which were independent of the brain, and thus not under the control of volition. I do not stop to remark on the frogs and turtles which were the subjects of some of his researches, because he also experimented on other creatures more nearly alhed to man. Now, we are early reminded by Dr. Marshall Hall's proceedings, as in some other Vivisectional matters, how true it is, as Professor Whewell has said; and to which I endeavoured to direct attention many years ago; that discoveries for the most part result fi'om the philosophical interpretation of common and even familiar phenomena. Dr. Marshall Hall, when he wishes to impress the fact of what he terms reflex action, cites the phenomena of tickhng ; and a very good illustration it is, of the violence with which muscles will sometimes act independently of volition, and in some exceptional cases, he might have added, in rather an undesirable degree. In following out these and similar phenomena, Dr. Marshall Hall arrives at some conclusions with regard to epilepsy, which are in many points interesting. We should, indeed, hesitate to adopt some of his conclusions, were it not that he accompanies them with judicious cautions, by which they are brought within lha range of the ordinaiy resources of good surgeryâ€”but which, on the same grounds, appear to me to have

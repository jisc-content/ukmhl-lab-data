ANTHONY G. JONES, Esq. Hatlierley, Gloucester. Deae Sik, Sliould anytbing beneficial result from the discus- sion whicli took place on the question of Vivisection, at the numerous meeting, held in Gloucester, on the 24th of October last, a large portion of it will have been derived from your kind assistance, and the effi- cient manner in which it was supphed. As the mutual courtesies, necessarily observed by those who have to address public assemblies, oblige them to limit the time they severally occupy, I have endeavoured to supple- ment the few remarks which I ventured on making, by the little book of which I now beg yom* accept- ance. As I would also desire to express, as emphatically as may be in my power, the sense I entertain of the service you then rendered to a cause equally impor- tant to science as to humanity, I would beg you to accept the dedication of the little volume as an earnest of the cordiality with which I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, G. MACILWAiN.

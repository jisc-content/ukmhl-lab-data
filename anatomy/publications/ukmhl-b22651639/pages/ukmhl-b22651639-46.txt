38 and tlie necessary tests they would have afforded to the value or the necessity of Vivisection. The most zealous advocates of Vivisection do not pretend that it is vindicable in cases open to other modes of enquiry. Why were not these communicated to the Com- mission ? Was this reticence the result of the bhnding influence of foregone conclusion—the absence of positive knowledge of what has already been done—or of ignorance or inattention to that which is obviously still within the grasp of Philosophical Pathology ? The experiments of Dr. Jones were cited before the Royal Commission in proof of the advantages of Vivi- section, and, had they been necessary, I should have not made any remark on them; but now let us see how the case really stands. It is clear that Dr. Jones's experiments were not instituted from any predilection in favour of Vivisection, as contrasted with more scientific modes of enquiry. He saw many cir- cumstances which it was important thoroughly to understand, of which there have been abundant opjportunities of understanding, but which opportunities had been either totally disregarded, or allowed to pass away without anything hke studious or scientific cultivation by his predecessors. I must not be misunderstood as deprecating the value of Dr. Jones's researches in the abstract; but the means he adopted were not the only nor the best, l^o man could extemporise a renewal of such neglected opportunities; they could of course only be obtained by being patiently waited for as they might occur. Abstractedly, Dr. Jones's researches were made with great care and good sense; but, had the true

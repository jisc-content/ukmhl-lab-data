Some of his opponents alleged that aneurism resulted by a so-called weakness of the tube (artery). To disprove this, Hunter dissected off the external coats of an -artery, so that the blood could be seen through the denuded inner coat; the wound was then closed in the usual manner. Now, when the animal was killed, everything was found healed and as sound as it was before. So much for the assertion that Hunter dis- covered his improvement of the treatment of aneurism by Vivisection. Now, his real Vivisections were un- necessary, but they show how much of that absurd proceeding results from the deficient study or the stupidity of others. "When what is popularly called matter, or pus, was formed in any part, it was con- cluded that it resulted from a sort of melting or solu- tion of the solid part; Hunter must have known better, because we have several diseases which prove that the idea was imfounded. Hunter, to assure others, pro- duced inflammation and pus in certain parts of animals â€”^in parts wherein he could most clearly have shown that there was none of that solution which had been supposed. But in those very parts, besides some others, the occurrence of disease had shown the same fact over and over again; so that his experiments were unnecessary. He also made experiments on arteries, but they were very different proceedings from those which represent the proceedings of some modern Tivisectors. Hunter wished to know how far the

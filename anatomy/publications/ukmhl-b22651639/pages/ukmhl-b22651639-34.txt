26 hear results from the causes to wliicli we refer it, it is (thus obtained) a very barren result. It is a mere abstraction, with not one of those instructive accom- paniments which pathological investigation in the human subject never fails to disclose, and hardly ever, in my experience, without some contribution towards the ascertainment of the causes from which the disease has arisen, or from the phenomena by which it has been accompanied. Here, again, we observe those discordant interpretations of these sensuous enquiries, which so puzzhngly exemphfy those endless dis- crepancies of opinion inseparable from this kind of investigation. I give an example or two. Dr. Hope says : " Now, the ventricular diastole (relaxation), says *' Majendie, is synchronous with the auricular systole " (contraction); consequently the auricles, after theu" *' systole, must remain in the state of spasmodic con- " traction for the period of a second and a quarter, " waiting for the next contraction of the ventricles, " which are unexcited by the stimulus of distension. " This is monstrous; its physiological impossibility " is palpable, etc." (Hope, p. 62.) Again, Dr. Hope observes: " It is easy to see how " M. Majendie has been misled hy operating on living " animals, for I have always found that when the " animal unforhmately retained the slightest degree of *' sensibility, the action of the heart was so violenft " convulsive, and rajoid, as to present the appearance " of alternate action described by M. Majendie. In " small animals also, as rabbits, whose pulse beats *' from 150 to 200 in a minute, the same appearance

82 " A. Certainly. But we cannot observe patho- logical processes in sucli patients; for instance, the *' most common of all morbid processes, viz., in- " flammation—^we only learn ivhat it is, and how it " is' to be induced, and what agents will affect it, by " observation on the living animal." It seems to me that the foregoing answer is a series of the most unintelligible matter that any physiologist, pathologist, or surgeon, can have to consider. I should say—and I think I have long since proved—that in re- gard to all the essential characters of inflammation, there is no source comparable to that furnished by observation of the living human body, whence the true nature of what is called inflammation can be deduced. Everything regarding it, that I know of, as deduced from sight merely, has only tended to obscure the real natm^e of the process. Inflammation is itself a very good illustration of the fact. The ordinary definition of it as heat, redness, pain, etc., in the part, I showed, in a scientific sense, many years ago, is so incorrect, that not one of these characters is essential to it. Professor Humphry seems to attach great importance to certain mechanical relations between the contents and the vessels of the part, though he does not state the experiment. This, however, is of little consequence, because it is impossible to deduce the laivs governing inflammation from any experiments on living animals, to be compared for one moment with the beautiful and demonstrative phenomena which may be observed in man. I stated formerly, when I was referring to the microscope and other phenomena observed by Kalten-

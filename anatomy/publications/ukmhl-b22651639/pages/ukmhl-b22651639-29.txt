21 " doctrine of the circulation as an inference or induction " only, not as a sensible demonstration. He adduced " certain circumstances, and quoted various anatomical " facts, wMch made a continuous transit of the blood from the arteries into the veins, and from the veins " into the arteries, a necessary consequence; but he *' never saiu the transit. His idea of the way in which "it was accomplished was even defective; he had no " notion of the one order of sanguiferous vessels ending "by unintGiTupted continuity, or by an intermediate " vascular network in the other order. This was the " demonstration of a later day, and of one who first saw " the light (Malpighi) in the course of the very year "when Harvey's work on the heart was pubHshed." Sm^ely nothing can be more convincing, that he founded his reasoning on the anatomical facts, show- ing that the very nature of the valves of the heart determined the course of the blood in that organ; whilst the only course permitted by the superficial veins completed the conclusion. These anatomical facts were not, and could not, be demonstrated (as I have said) on a living bleeding animal. I must now conclude all I have space for on this part of the subject. As I told Lord Cardwell in reference thereto, Harvey did not discover the circulation of the blood by Vivisection; and I added that I did not see how it was possible to demonstrate it in a living animalâ€”neither do I now; and if that which I have stated here does not convince the reader of the impossibility of doing so, and of the marvellous superiority of the dissection of the dead on such a subject as the circulation (too certainly marred

103 witli impunity, it occurred to me as unreasonable to expect that an intestine just liberated from a ligature, whicli liad been impeding the circulation in it, it might be, for hours—and sometimes, more or less, for even days—would be expected to resume its functions on the instant that the ligature was removed. And then I began to attach the phenomena to what T have enun- ciated as a general law, viz., that whenever you find mucous and serous membranes associated in the same organ, and the irritation of the mucous surface is accom- panied by some obstacle which opposes the proper rehef of the mucous (that is, by secretion), it is more than probable that you will have the irritation or its effects transferred to the serous membrane. I believe this to be an explanation of the fatality attending the use of purgative medicines in such cases, because it is general, whenever such structures are associated. These are things which are deduced from pathology in the human subject. I may mention a case or two be- fore I conclude; but now to recur to Mr. Travers. Mr. Travers, in the same book, says that the great danger of the operation for strangulated hernia is from the inflammation of the peritoneum (the mem- brane which lines the abdomen, and affords the out- side covering to the bowels). That is true; but now hear the remedy he proposes. He says: "The great means to " combat this is by purgatives. If there is no peritonitis, " we give purgatives," he says," to prevent it; and if there " is peritonitis, to cure it." JSTow no greater mistake, nor any more fatal3 I believe, was ever made, and I do not see how it is possible to dissociate it from his experi- ments on the bowels of animals, and those reparative

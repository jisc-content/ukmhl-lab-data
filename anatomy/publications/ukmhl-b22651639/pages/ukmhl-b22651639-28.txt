20 " place simultaneously witli tlie dilatation of the ven- *' tricles; and, vice versa, tliat the contraction of the ventricles coincides with the dilatation of the auricles, " etc." (Quoted hj Bouillaud, Traite 1, p. 57.) Now, hear Dr. Hope. " The great defect of this view is " that it leaves no interval of repose. It is easy to see " hoiv M. Majendie has been misled, viz., by ojjerating " on living animals; for I have always found that when " an animal unfortunately retained or regained the " slightest degree of sensibility, the action of the *' heart was so violent, convulsive, and rapid, as to " prevent the appearance of alternate action described " by M. Majendie." Again, on another statement of M. Majendie in relation to the action of the auricles and ventricles. Dr. Hope observes, " This is monstrous! " Its physiological impossibility is palpable." Again of Majendie, Dr. Hope observes, " Fortunately his high " authority is opposed by that of Harvey and Haller. " M. Bouillaud appears to follow Majendie (Bouillaud " Traite, p. 87), and this error has betrayed him into " several others respecting physical signs. Dr. Bostock "also follows Majendie, but evidently fi'om inad- " vertence, etc." Before I leave this subject, I would quote a passage from Dr. WilHs' Life of Harvey, which seems entnely to confirm my view that Harvey discovered the circu- lation as a necessary result of his examination of what (for shortness) I may call the mechanism of the circula- tion, viz., the valves and the perceptible relation of them to the cuiTcnt in which they were interposed. Dr. Willis, after some other very interesting observations, says: " For Harvey, it must be here observed, left the

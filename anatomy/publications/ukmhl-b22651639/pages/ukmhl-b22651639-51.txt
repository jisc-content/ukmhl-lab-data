43 But I need not furtlier enlarge, by any observations of my own, the instructive and significant commentary of Dr. Jones, on the absence of that assiduity, that careful and comprehensive observation of pathological phenomena, which is really the only foundation of any hope of rendering medicine and surgery a more posi- tive science.

We will consider the improvement

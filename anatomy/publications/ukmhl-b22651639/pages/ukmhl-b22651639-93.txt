I cannot say that there may not be men who take some- thing like this view of our profession. This surely cannot be the real meaning of the passage in Dr. Humphry's evidence, which, however, it seems con- structively to imply; when, instead of the study of causes by the legitimate paths of inductive research, we would endeavour to relieve the sufferings of intelli- gent beings, by minimizing these consequences, and by a mode of investigation, which would attempt the relief of sufferings evoked by ignorance or the folly of intel- ligent beings, by inflicting other and, probably, infi- nitely greater sufferings on unoffending animals.

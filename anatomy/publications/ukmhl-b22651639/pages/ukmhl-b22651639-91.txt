83 brunner, as to what was observable in the vessels of the inflamed partâ€”" What we want to know is, why " the phenomena occur at all; luhy the whole process " is set up; not how this or that feature of it may be " produced."* The law of the integral process is the desideratum^ I said, and that is not to be found in the part. I then proceeded to show, as I contend, several very important results from my observations. At one time, bleeding was almost universal in inflammation; then cases not appropriate for bleeding were referred to different morbid conditions; but I showed that, even in the most undoubted cases of inflammation, the pro- priety of bleeding, or not, depended on certain other conditions; and cited examples where inflammation had been, under the alleged conditions, successfully treated without any depletion; and to meet doubts (at that time very ready to be started) as to whether the cases might not have been mistaken, cited cases of active inflammations of the eye, accompanied by matter in the anterior chamber, which' could not be open to mistake. This, however, was not all; but I cannot pursue this matter further here. That kind of investigation which attaches so much importance to mechanical con- ditions of the minute vessels, may be interesting and curious, but it does nothing towards helping us to get at the laio governing inflammation and other diseased processes. It may furnish curious objects for amuse- ment by the microscope, but it affords in my view very little help or interest in lighting us to any generalization. There is a great deal in Dr. Humphry's * Medicine and Surgery One Inductive Science. G 2

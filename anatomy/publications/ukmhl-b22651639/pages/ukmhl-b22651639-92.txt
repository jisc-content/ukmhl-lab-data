84 remarks, which I should think would astonish some experienced pathologists; but as it chiefly rests on assertions, which are not supported by facts or reason- ing, I cannot afford more space for them. One statement is somewhat discouraging to those who may participate in the views of Professor Humphry. He says : "Pathological experiments, I think, become more " and more necessary as civilization advances. Civili- zation is the great engenderer of disease; and unless " the healing art is made to advance in proportion, " there will be, as the result of civilization, a distinct " degeneration of manâ€”physical and moral. I think " there is no doubt of that; and, therefore, it is *' necessary to take every means possible, most earnestly " and anxiously, to understand the nature of disease, and to prevent it." I hardly dare ventm'e on defining the real meaning of this passage, nor can I reconcile in any way, consistently with common sense, the apparent meaning of it. Of course, I do not know what may be Dr. Humphry's definition of civiHzation; it certainly does not convey to my mind the character that he appears so necessarily to combine with it. It seems difficult to understand how those pheno- mena which, as a whole, constitute what are called diseases, and which, either directly or indirectly, result for the greater part from the follies, the vices, or the ignorance of mankind, must necessarily be multipHed, ^ari 'passu, with the progress of civilization. I can by no extension of the meaning of " civilization," arri\-e at anything like the view here stated. Were civiHza- tion to mean notTiing but a life of luxury and sensual indulgence, or even mixed with an exaggerated form

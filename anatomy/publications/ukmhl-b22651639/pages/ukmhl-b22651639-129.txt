121 that " Yon may repeat the experiment several times " on the same dog mthout any serious inconvenience, " as the animal, ivhen jjrojyerly selected, ' does not " ' suffer much,' notwithstanding the delicacy of the " organs wounded." We are not told to what property the "properly selected" refers. Again, we are in- formed that, " In consequence of the tendency of the " fistula to heal, if you want much of the secretion, " you must perform the experiment on the same dog " several times, or on many dogs at the same time." M. Claude Bernard, remembering that he is only reasoning from analogy, and not a very close one either, asks—" Is the pancreatic juice found in man, " and that obtained from dogs, identical?" To this he answers : " I am prepared to answer in the affirma- *' tive." I suspect that those who study physiology by the light of pathology in the human subject, will not be quite so prepared as is M. Bernard - with this affirmative; but let us see how he meets the difficulty. He observes : " And if differences have heen observed, " I strongly suspect, as in the preceding cases (two " cases of pancreatic fistulge in the human subject), *' they are to be attributed to the unhealthy condition *' of the gland in the human subject in whom the " fistulge existed." For he remarks—and I beg the reader's particular attention to the whole of this reasoning—" On making infusions of the pancreas " taken from condemned criminals, by allowing it to " macerate in tepid water, a liquid entirely similar to " the pancreatic juice in the canine species is obtained. " In the normal state, therefore, secretion in the man, and, indeed, the dog, are the same." Another remark ^f M. Bernard, in regard to these artificial fistulous

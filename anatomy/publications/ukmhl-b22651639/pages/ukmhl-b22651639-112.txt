104 processes wliicli lie exemplifies. There were other errors in the treatment of these cases; and one of these was an indiscriminate recom-se to bleeding, by which a circumscribed inflammatory process may easily (with- out care and discrimination) be converted into the diffused inflammation of peritonitis. If Mr. Travers had wished to have ascertained the practical deductions least open to mistake, he should have imitated all the circumstances, so as to have rendered the parallelism of the two cases, as far as was possible, complete; but this, even though he had bled or pm'ged his dogs, would still have left many particulars, rendering it impossible to complete the analogy. But not to antici- pate a few words I have to add on the general subject, I will conclude this by adverting to two cases, exem- plifying in two states, the one the most simple, the other most dangerous in its complexities, yet both showing the advantage of avoiding the dangerous practice which Mr. Travers seemed to have deduced, or supported, on such unsafe premises as his experi- ments on animals. I operated, one evening, on a large strangulated hernia in a woman, between fifty and sixty years of age; there was nothing extraordi- nary in the case; the intestine was deeply congested, but nothing suggesting an untoward issue. The next morning I called, and. seeing her dressed and sitting by the fire, I did not recognise her, but enquired for the- patient, when she said, " I am the patient. Sir."

The other case was one of the most serious kind, and

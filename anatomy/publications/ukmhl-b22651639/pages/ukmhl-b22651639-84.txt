76 is not likely to mislead a surgeon so far as to place a ligature on the aorta, unless under some extraordinary complications of accident, which, the utmost stretch of the imagination can hardly suppose to happen or indi- cate. Sir WilHam does not seem well acquainted with the progress of the treatment of aneurism by ligature, and we have no space to insert it here. Shortly, the progress of tying larger arteries than Hunter had done, was due to Ramsden, Abernethy, Stevens, Chne, Cooper, Travers, and others, who respectively placed Hgatures on the external ihac, the common ihac, common carotid, etc. But the statement that Sir Astley taught sur- geons, etc., can, by no stretch of courtesy, be admitted. Here, as in every other subject, patholo- gical data are alone the reliable teachers. If ever the aorta is successfully tied in man, or justifiably under- taken, it can only be on some complicated condition of things difficult to imagine, and on the evidence which exists that the artery has been, in some very rare instances of disease, found on dissection of the dead, nearly, or quite, impervious; and yet the body nourished by collateral channels. Here again, as we constantly show, lies the superiority of that teaching which every sm^geon feels the essential basis of operative proceedings, viz., the observation of the living phenomena, and the inspection of the dead. I shall have occasion, in another place, to advert to some other proceedings of Sir Astley Cooper, which may well help to warn us fi'om the folly of Vivisection. Sir William has some other ideas, in which we cannot participate. He seems to object to any legal enactments tending to place restrictions

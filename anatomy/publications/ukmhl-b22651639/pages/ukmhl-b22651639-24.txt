16 veins, being firm and elastic ; the veins being thinner and readily collapsing when empty. In certain parts valves are placed, allowing the blood to pass only in one direction. These valves are placed on both sides of the heart, and also at the commencement of the arteries issuing from it. There are also valves in the veins, but chiefly, if not entirely, in those which are superficial and which are conceivably more subject to pressure fi'om without. Now, all this can be de- monstrated in the dead body by the most ordinary dissection, and in an intelligible manner on the dead body only. All ? Why not exactly ? The valves show you in what dh^ection the blood must travel; but you cannot demonstrate the terminations of the arteries in the veins, or capillaries leading to them, unless you inject the vessels by the arteries with colom^ed fluid, which -v^tII return by the veins; and now if you dissolve some wax, or other material, in the fluid, which will render it solid on cooHng, you have all that is necessary to demonstrate the fact in question. Now, I am utterly at a loss to conceive how that which can be so easily and simply demonstrated on the dead, can be demonstrated at all on the living. I can by no means accept this as a fact, nor do I find that Harvey stated that he had done so. I have in my time dissected and examined a great number of the bodies of the dead, and I have witnessed, and performed myself, a great number of operations on the li\^ng, in a long practice of my profession, always in London, and combining with private practice that of public institutions with which I was officially connected.

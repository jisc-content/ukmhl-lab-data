123 where, in their experiments on the pancreas, they describe the secretion thns obtained as being first acid, and then the very opposite, that is to say, alkaline. Then, to judge of the identity of the secretion of the pancreas in dogs and the human subject, the in- fluence of the experiment itself in disturbing the natural character of the secretion seems altogether disregarded; and with an equally bold assumption, the normal condition of the secretion in man is as- sumed in that of the secretion taken from the pan- creas of a condemned criminal, and allowing it to macerate in tepid water. Now, whatever may be thought of Vivisection, either by those who regard it as a lamentable fallacy, or by those who still are inclined to think it not without its use, there can be, I think, but one impression as to the reasoning which I have just described. For my part, it is such a " hop, *' step, and jump " kind of philosophy, that it apj)ears to me scarcely less than a miraculous abnormity of mind, which can induce any man (on a subject which requires the greatest care, the most comprehensive circumspection, to avoid interfering influences), to reason in a manner which so easily disregards so many obvious sources of fallacy. It would be cm^ous to hear what an analytical chemist would say, if he were shewn as a specimen of the normal secretion of a gland, that which had been macerated in warm water, and previously taken from the body of a condemned criminal. Surely it does not require a professional teacher to test the fallacy, or assumed value, of the conclusions in question.

The elements of fallacy are endless. In the first place, the unnatural condition of the dog renders it absolutely impossible to say what would happen. Distress and pain will very readily act on some secre- tion, but no one can predict what. The "ultima moriens" symptom in most animals, is usually accompanied by some secretion, apart from the mere relaxation of the sphincter muscles.

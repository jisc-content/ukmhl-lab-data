29 DR. MARSHALL HALL. The labours of this industrious physician and his work on the Nervous System have been cited in proof of the advantages of Vivisection. Let us consider the subject, and especially in relation to disease, whence Dr. Marshall Hall would deduce its chief claims to attention. We must not confound his many practical remarks, and the greater attention he would exact to the causes of disease, with his Vivisections. The former represent things which are still too little attended to ; the latter lead me (in which I think the reader will participate) to a somewhat different con- clusion. He will probably with me regret that so much valuable time was wasted, or not otherwise employed, in eliciting a still more practical view from the facts which it was Dr. Marshall Hall's object to discover. Those who are, or have been, constantly engaged at the bedside, will instinctively apply the question, cui bono ? to everything alleged as new; and this not only in an absolute sense, but also (and especially in relation to elaborate experiments) in a comparative sense, viz.. How far this or that discovery might not be more securely deduced from more scientific modes of enquiry. Viewed abstractedly, the Nervous System no doubt presents many phenomena more or less puzzling; but many of these become very intelligible in their practical apphcation, when we regard them as occurring in the living human hody in health and disease. Thus examined, we are able to arrive at generalisations, or

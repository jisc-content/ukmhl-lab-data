Why should they have thought that the same nerve should serve both for motion and sensation ? People do not smell by the optic, or see by the auditory nerve ; and if we do not disbelieve Sir Charles Bell's own account, he did not endeavour to solve the question by Vivisection. I cannot help regretting that there is so much of opinion in the evidence of Sir George Burrows; I cannot say that his recognition of Sir Charles Bell's or Dr. M.

I will illustrate what I intend to convey by referring to what Sir G-eorge says in reference to Sir Charles Bell.

CHAPTER III. CONCLUSION. I CANNOT at present fiirtlier multiply these com- ments on tlie evidence before tlie Royal Commission on Vivisection. If tlie question be subjected to tlie process that I have long recommended it should be, it would not be long before it engaged the intellectual examination of the public. This examination, carefully and calmly- Conducted, would soon be followed by a great diminu- tion—if not an entire abandonment—of that reticence on the subject, which has been more or less observed by a very large proportion of the more reflective members of our great profession. ISTo man, who knows how much suffering of mind and body, and, I may add, often of purse also, so invariably accom- panies any opposition to a prevailing conventionalism, will be surprised, or impatient, on knowing how many professional men distrust the practice of Vivisection; how many cordially disapprove of it on scientific, no less than on moral grounds, and yet who do not think it necessary or expedient to promulgate their senti^ ments beyond the area of their respective circles.

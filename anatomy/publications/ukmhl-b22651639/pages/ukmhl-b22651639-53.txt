45 facts carefully interpreted, lias suggested the most reasonable mode of relief. This gradual diminution of the impetus of the blood, is just what we endea- vour to effect by our various operations, such as graduated and constant pressure, or passing a ligature around the artery. The old way was to open the tumour, tie the artery at the entrance and exit from it, and trust to the collateral branches to carry on the ch'culation. There were many objec- tions to this mode of proceeding. It was serious, dangerous, and, too often, unsuccessful. John Hunter considered that the failures resulted, in many cases, from the artery being tied too near the disease, and where, the vessel being unsound, the reparative processes were not effected. You should tie the artery, said he, farther from the sac, where you probably will find that the artery is sound. This he proceeded to do; his anticipations were not long in being verified, and this forms the improve- ment he discovered in the treatment of this disease. The whole history of aneurism is very interesting, exemplifying how often it happens that the real study of disease in the living body suggests the best means of assisting nature in the cure of it. John Hunter's idea, that the artery was often diseased, was a fact ascertained by dissection of the dead; so was the fact that the diseased condition did not neces- sarily extend far above the aneurism; and that diseased -parts were not endowed with those reparative powers, which are usually found in parts which are sound. Now, these were no random shots, so to speak, of the imagination, to be proved or disproved by experiments

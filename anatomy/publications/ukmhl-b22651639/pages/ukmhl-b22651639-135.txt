127 far as tliat nnmber of them can suffice; but I do contend that the number was by no means satisfactory, as regards any branch of the great question submitted to them, and that the power of pathological investiga- tion, as disclosing and testing the suggestions of the physiologist—the one the most indispensable of any— was least impressively represented of all. One gentleman put a question, saying interroga- tively, he supposed the witness thought we had pretty well exhausted the resources of the dead-house, or words to that effect. Why, who ever thought of find- ing the great lessons of pathological research in the dead-house, except those of whom there seems to be no dearth, viz., those who confound pathology with morbid anatomy ? This is indeed an important element in pathological investigations, but it does not direct our enquiries, nor help us much (if at all) in the detec- tion of causes, but it is, nevertheless, valuable in testing our conclusions. Here again is seen the ten- dency to attach so much interest to sight. Morbid anatomy teaches us the changes that organs undergo; but what the pathologist desires, is to have such a comprehensive record of the antecedent phenomena, as to help him to the causes of that change. The questions, which are too often left to be solved by mere opinion, are just those which—^lying at the root of the whole enquiry—should have been most fully and searchingly developed, as borne out by plain and incontestable facts. For example, it was some- times asked in relation to some fact stated in favour of Vivisection, " and you are of opinion that that *' could not have beeu obtained by other means ? "

122 openings, isâ€”" In these experiments the results, by " various observers, do not agree;" and again, as if under no form could one detach elements of fallacy from this unphilosophical mode of research, M. Ber- nard observes, with a kind of " sang froid,'' not in itself insignificant, but much more valuable as coming from a Vivisector, that in " living animals, the use of " anaesthetics would appear convenient, but the hquid " thus obtained does not enjoy the usual j^rojyerties." Now let us glance at this reasoning. The object is to ascertain the nature of the pancreatic secretion, for which too many opportunities have been offered in the human subject by wars, by accidents of travel, and various other occasions in persons who have been suddenly killed in perfect health. Now then, to revert to the proceedings of M. Bernard. 1st. The animal is a living dog, well selected (we are not told how), and a painful experiment is performed on him, it may be " several times," or you may experiment "on many " dogs at the same time." Here the obscming ele- ments, inseparable from so distm'bed a condition of the nervous system, or on which system the secretion entirely depends, is so httle regarded as to any in- fluence it may exert on the matter secreted, that we are told that the experiment may be done several times on the same dog, or on several dogs at the same time; another assumption, viz., that all the dogs will produce the secretion you desire, without any qualifi- cation as to the kind, the ages, the sex, or any other of the numerous varieties observable in these animals, further multiplied as they are by domestication. We may learn the insecurity of this kind of assumption from the experiments of Tiedemann and G-melin,

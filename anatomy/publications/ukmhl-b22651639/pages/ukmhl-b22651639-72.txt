A number of cliildi-en were inoculated in " succession, one from tlie other; and after several " months liad elapsed, they were exposed to the infec- " tion of the small-pox, some by inoculation, others by " variolous effluvia, and some in both ways, but they " all resisted it." (See p. 2 of the Appendix to the Eoyal Commission of 1857.) . I think I have now said enough to show that what is intended by " Vivisection " had nothing whatever of influence in the discovery of Vaccination. Jenner trod the only path which is most auspicious for physiologi- cal or pathological discovery; that is, by the study of facts—whether of disease or other—in the Hving animal, and which has, as he demonstrated, not only the property of most probably leading you to that which you seek, but almost always to other facts of inestimable value. To have Jenner's labom^s brought forward as evidence of the advantage of dissection of living animals, to a Commission appointed specially to consider the claims of Vivisection, is something that I am unwilhng to describe by terms which many might think the most appropriate; but this I will say, that like many other parts of the evidence, it is not only not borne out by the facts of the case, but is of an entirely misleading character. If a man makes a statement which is absolutely untrue, well, it may in time be con- tradicted, though the advocates of Vivisection have nevertheless repeated assertions which have been as repeatedly refuted. But the more mischievous error is that Avhich has a mixture of truth, of which the evidence before the Commission also affords examples. This leads to confusion of ideas, which can only be

90 bites, so far from this being a warranty for experi- ments on brutes, it occurs to me, as distinguished from the right mode of proceeding, very hke the woodman cutting off the branch on which he was standing. Now, it is impossible to exaggerate the gravity of this question. It is an astounding example of our ignorance on one of the most important subjects on which medical men could be engaged. No doubt it is beset with difficulties of various kinds; but those very difficulties should not only minimize, but at once dwarf, any consideration of the difficulty or complexities, financial or other, necessary to surmounting them. I, of course, would be understood as speaking cautiously with regard to measm^es of which the institution may involve other difficulties than those which occur to me. But I cannot help believing that, with such a field for experiments, in all respects un- exampled, measures might be adopted, to which it would be unreasonable to attribute or compare any experiments on animals. I conceive that almost any number of supposed antidotes might be divided into any varieties of doses or combinations, and so distri- buted, that at least a very large number of persons might be provided with them, so that they could be taken without a moment's delay. In modifying and multiplying doses, the very fact that a man is to die in a timo varying, perhaps, from an hour, or less, to a few hours, would soon give a latitude in practice, greater than in any other known enquiry. Besides which, it is conceivable that the Indian Grovernment could devise means by which at least a great many, though perhaps not a majority, of the results might be

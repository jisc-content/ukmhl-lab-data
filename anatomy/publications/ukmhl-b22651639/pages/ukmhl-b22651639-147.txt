That what has been observed as to the outward and visible sign of disease in the body, as not representing with any security the seat of its cause, should, in harmony with the sublime compre- hensiveness of natural laws, present us with its ana- logue in the mind itself; where we perceive that the outward and visible acts, whatever maybe their intrinsic character, may be, and generally are, no expositions of the motive which led to them, and thus elevate us to a point of view, whence we have a larger and more posi- tive field for the cultivation of psychological analysis, than we could obtain from any less elaborate mode of proceeding. JSFow, to suppose that a science justifying such as- pirations as these, built not on any mere theory, but on the close cohesion and inseparable relations of de- monstrable facts, should be assisted, or even be an appropriate subject for the sensuous proceeding termed Vivisection, is, to my mind, a desecration of the highest objects to which the scientific mind can aspire, to the lowest and most barren modes of enquiry. Surely the idea of any great truth being developed in physiology by such means, is the very insanity of scienceâ€”the very bathos of intellectual aberration. The subject of auEesthetics requires more examination than has yet been given to it, on the side of science. As to its in- fluence in removing the scientific objections to Vivisec- tion, it is acknowledged to be often obscuring, and some- times inadmissible. It is, indeed, surprising how any rational being can suppose that he can educe any

25 " The pericardium was next opened, and the auricles " and ventricles fully displayed." They now observed the heart as it lay beating. Other experiments of the same kind were made. Various auscultatory and manipulatory measures were now instituted; such as listening for sounds, pinching certain parts of the organ, inserting hooks to raise the valves, thrusting a knuckle from one cavity of the heart towards another, applying the stethoscope on the heart, and similar more or less varied proceedings, by one or more of those who were witnessing the experiment. The object of all this was to ascertain to what particular part or structure of the heart certain sounds were to be respectively referred, and in this way to assist us in recognising the seat and sources of any or similar sounds emitted by the human heart during our investigation of its diseases. My first objection to this mode of proceeding is its manifest inferiority to opportunities afforded by the human subject, were they investigated by careful examinations and a faithful record; in short, by anything deserving the name of really philosophical or pathological research. It assumes in the first place that the sounds given out by the heart of the ass are identical with those of the human heart; that may be, or may not; at all events, the assumption belongs to the mode, and not to the matter. Then again, the heart of the ass was sound, not diseased. Again, the animal was placed in circumstances having no re- semblance to those under which we investigate the teart in the human subject. Then supposing that by this experiment we ascertain that the sound we

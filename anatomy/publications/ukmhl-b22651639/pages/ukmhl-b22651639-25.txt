17 On the very tliresliold of tlie Yivisectional enquiry, the wound would be so obscured by blood, as to create nothing but doubt and confusion, and this would not be rendered less puzzling by the blood from arteries and veins being of different colours. In the most ordinary operations in surgery, as tying arteries, we are obliged to have an assistant sponging our way (as it were), that we may not include anything, which we should not, in the ligature we are about to use. In operations which require more time, and where that which we may desire to remove has often more or less complicated connections with important parts, this sponging is still more necessary. Now, it is impossible to clear this state of things in a living animal, so as to do anything to convey even a proximate idea of the circulation. By inspecting the vessels by the mi- / croscope, in the frog for example, a man previously informed might get some idea of the matter; but then he would substitute a doubtful analogy, not for a moment comparable with the simple demonstration afforded by dissection of the vessels of the human subject. The effect of the interposition of valves in tubes conveying fluid could not be mistaken, and the existence of these was not unknown; moreover, the valves in the superficial veins had been discovered; and now, I think, we begin to see our way to the truth in relation to Harvey. These valves—I mean, the valves of the superficial veins—were discovered by Hieronymus Fabricius, of Aquapendente, in Italy, who was Harvey's Teacher, and this seems to have been the last point whence emanated the instructive and intel- c

Jolin Hunter's enquiries were confined to no one depart- ment of nature, nor, perhaps, to any mode of research. His experiments on heat, and other subjects, involved very interesting researches, both in the vegetable as well as the animal kingdom. Few men have left such material monuments of indefatigable labour, or ex- amples of more penetrative research. But John Hunter's elaborate and comprehensive observation of various phenomena was never more beneficially, nor, as I believe, more earnestly exerted, than in assisting him in his careful and discriminative interpretation of various but obvious facts occm-ring only in the living man. I allude to that correlation of parts which I have already mentioned, and which he called the sympathies of the body. Nothing can be more instructive, nothing more encouraging, than these long neglected labours. Abernethy used to say that when Hunter lectured on the sympathies of the body, one portion of his audience were seen to be " giggling," whilst another was disposed to go to sleep. There were, however, some of his contemporaries who knew "better the value of all that he did, and none more so than Cline and Abernethy.

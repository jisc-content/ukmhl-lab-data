92 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. the choroid plexus and posterior cms of the fornix passing into it, and is to be exhibited in its whole length, on one side, by placing the point of the knife in the cornu and cutting upwards outside the corpus striatum, and freely in the outward direction, so as to remove a large block of the hemisphere. By this section the striated structure from which the corpus striatum is named is exhibited ; and in the descend- ing cornu are seen the elevation termed hippocampus major, the fimbria (taenia hippocampi) internal to it, continued down from the posterior cms of the fornix, and the choroid plexus; also, at the extremity of the cornu, the pes hippocampi, the expanded and digitated extremity of the hippocampus major. The corpus callosum is now to be cut across about an inch from the posterior border; the septum luci- dum in front of this is to be divided with scissors, and the part of the corpus callosum thus liberated is to be reflected forwards or removed. Between the two layers of the septum lucidum the fifth ventricle can now be seen [617]; a view is also obtained of the whole upper surface of the fornix [618]. For the removal of the fornix the best mode of proceeding is to make two cuts, severing the remain- ing posterior parts of the corpus callosum from the hemispheres. Each cut should be directed forwards and outwards from the point where the back of the corpus callosum passes into the hemisphere, and is to be carried through the posterior crus of the fornix, without injury to the underlying reflection of pia mater. The back part of the corpus callosum can then be lifted up, and the fornix attached to it can

28 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. musculo-cutaneous extends as far as the wrist, reinforced by the inferior external cutaneous branch of the musculo- spiral. On the inner side the internal cutaneous will be followed to the wrist, its anterior branch in front, and its posterior branch on the dorsal aspect, the anterior branch sometimes joined by a small branch from the ulnar. Near the wrist, the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve [519], for the inner fingers, will be found emerging from the aponeurosis on the inner side, and the radial nerve [522], destined for the outer fingers, emerging on the outer side; while in front care must be taken not to injure the palmar branch of the median nerve [520], just above the annular ligament. A palmar branch of the ulnar nerve [519] reaches the hand and is to be sought for in front of the ulnar artery. The cutaneous veins of the arm and forearm must also be carefully studied [484]. Those on the outer and inner sides of the forearm, into which the veins from the dorsal surface pour their contents, are col- lected near the bend of the elbow into a radial and an ulnar vein, while in front there ascends another smaller trunk, the median, which below the bend of the elbow is very constantly joined by a deep median branch, and immediately thereafter divides into median cephalic and median basilic. These, joining the radial and ulnar respectively, form the cephalic and basilic veins which ascend on the outer and inner side of the front of the arm, the cephalic remaining superficial as has been seen, and the basilic dipping-in below the middle of the arm to join the deep veins. 6.

At the origin of these arises a mesial bunch of minute vessels which dip into the brain at the posterior per- forated spot at the back of the rhomboid space; and further out the posterior communicating artery on each side joins the posterior cerebral [422-425]. Further forwards are the divided internal carotid arteries, giving off the posterior communicating and anterior choroid arteries, and dividing into anterior and middle cerebral. The anterior choroid artery enters by the fissure between the crus cerebri and middle lobe of the brain to supply the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle. At its commencement the middle cerebral gives off a brush of small vessels dipping directly into the brain, and by their apertures of entrance forming the anterior perforated spot. Joining the anterior cerebral artery with its fellow is the ex- ceedingly short anterior communicating artery, which closes in front the circle of anastomosis completed behind by the posterior cerebral and posterior com- municating arteries, and known as the Circle of Willis. The surface of the brain is now to be more fully exposed by the removal of the arachnoid and pia mater, care being taken not to injure the origins of the nerves â€¢ and the arteries also are to be taken

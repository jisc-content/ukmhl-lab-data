DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 25 the circumflex nerve [521] curving round its hinder border. The manner in which the aponeurosis cover- ing the infraspinatus muscle splits at the posterior border of the deltoid, so as to pass partly on to its surface and partly beneath it, should be noted. When the deltoid muscle [260] has been properly studied, so far as it can be seen on its outer aspect, it should be divided near its origin; the large bursa beneath it, extending between the acromion and the shoulder-joint, should be inspected, and the posterior â– circumflex artery [435] and the circumflex nerve [521] should be displayed on the deep surface of the deltoid, and the extent of the insertion of the muscle made distinct. At this stage also the attachment of the long head of the triceps muscle of the arm [265] into the axillary border of the scapula should be fully displayed, and the manner should be noticed in which it subdivides the interval between the scapula, teres major and neck of the humerus, leaving a quadrangular space above, through which the circumflex nerve and posterior circumflex artery pass backwards, and a triangular space below, through which the dorsal branch of the subscapular artery takes its course. The investing aponeurosis is to be removed from the infraspinatus muscle [261], and that muscle is to be distinguished from the teres minor [262] wThich lies on its axillary border. The nerve to the teres minor is to be traced from the circumflex, and its gangliform swelling noted; and then the teres major and minor muscles may be studied together, so as to show their antagonistic actions in rotating the humerus when elevated. The supraspinatus

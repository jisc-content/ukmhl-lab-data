114 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. anterior belly of the digastric muscle and the mylo- hyoid muscle are to be divided near their maxillary attachment; and the lower jaw is to be sawn through near the symphysis. The divided portion of the jaw is to be turned upwards and the parts beneath dis- sected. In the fore part of the dissection will be seen the deep part of the submaxillary gland [707], with the duct of the gland (Wharton's duct) passing forwards to the lower part of the frsenum of the tongue. Close to this, adherent to the mucous mem- brane of the mouth, is the sublingual gland [708], about the size of an almond, with ducts too minute to be studied without making a special dissection {ducts of Walther and Bivini), some of them joining the submaxillary duct, and others opening independ- ently ; and crossing the submaxillary duct is the lingual or gustatory nerve [548], whose distribution along the side of the tongue is to be followed; and with the lower border of which, as it lies close to the submaxillary gland, the minute submaxillary ganglion [548], giving branches to the gland, is connected. The branch passing from the nerve to this ganglion can be traced into continuity with the chorda tympani. Further in the fore part of the dissection, resting on the mylo-hyoid, is the genio-hyoid muscle [339], and resting on the genio-hyoid is the inferior border of the genio-glossus [341], the back part of whose lingual attachment is still hid by the hyo-glossus [340]; and crossing the lower part of the hyo-glossus, to enter the genio-glossus, is the hypoglossal nerve [559]. Reaching the tongue from behind and decussating with the upper attachment of the hyo-glossus, is the

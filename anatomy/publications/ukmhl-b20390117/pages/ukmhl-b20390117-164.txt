154 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. bulb of the urethra and the prostate. The mesial incision should then be prolonged forwards, and the integument reflected from the anterior division of the perineum. In the anterior half of the perinseum, a superficial fascia or layer of the rete adiposum will be found continuous with that over the thighs and with the contents of the ischio-rectal fossa, and beneath it a layer of membranous fascia bound down to the arch of the pubes at the sides, and dipping down to be connected with the margin of the triangular ligament behind. This is what is sometimes called Colless fascia [392], and is important in the history of urinary infiltrations, as it prevents urine extravasated by injury of the spongy portion of the urethra from passing backwards into the hinder part of the peri- neum and down into the thighs. Before it has been much laid bare a blow-pipe should be introduced under it, and it should be inflated so as to exhibit that the district beneath it is cut off alike from the back part of the perinseum and from the thighs, and is also divided behind the scrotum by a mesial sep- tum, which being imperfect in front, allows the air, after it has reached the scrotum, to pass from one side to the other. As it extends forwards into the scrotum, this fascia will be noticed to become thicker, being continuous with the involuntary muscular tunic called the dartos [772, 392]. Entering beneath this fascia from behind will be found the two perineal branches [532] of the pudic nerve, and external to them, crossing in front of the ischial tuberosity, the pudendal branch [531] of the small sciatic nerve; also

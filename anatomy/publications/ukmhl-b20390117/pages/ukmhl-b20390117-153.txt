143 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. azygos, and those of the upper spaces followed so as to show whether they pour their blood into the vena azygos or left innominate vein, or both, as the case may be [479, 480]. The lung may then be replaced in its position. The right lung is next to be turned forwards, and the right pneumogastric nerve [555], lying outside the superior vena cava, is to be followed downwards; its cardiac and anterior pulmonary [557] branches are to be made out, as on the left side; and the posterior pulmonary plexus [557], the sympathetic chain [564], and the great splanchnic nerve are in like manner to be dissected. The great vena azygos [479] will be seen curving forwards above the root of the lung to open into the superior vena cava ; and when the root of the lung is dissected, the points in which it differs from that of the left lung are to be observed; namely, the bronchus entering at a higher level than the artery, the bronchial vein opening into the vena azygos, and the usually single bronchial artery arising sometimes from an intercostal vessel [747, 748]. Lying in loose tissue internal to the vena azygos will be found a slender white tube, the thoracic duct [497], sometimes double in part of its course ; and internal to this is the oesophagus [709]. With a little care, the thoracic duct may be even now traced up as it crosses the middle line in the upper part of the chest, behind the oesophagus and arch of the aorta, ascending behind the left pleura to end in the neck, at the angle of junction of the left internal jugular and subclavian veins. The arrangement of the intercostal veins entering the great vena azygos is to be exhibited,

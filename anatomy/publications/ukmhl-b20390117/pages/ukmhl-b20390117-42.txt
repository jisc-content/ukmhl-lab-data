34 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. the flexor digitorum profundus more internally ; and on turning these aside, one from the other, there will be seen in the lower part of the forearm the remaining deep muscle, the pronator quadratus, with its fibres placed transversely [273-275]. Descending to the pronator quadratus, on the interosseous membrane, can be seen the anterior interosseous nerve [520] and artery [441], whose origins have been already noted. 8. The Front of the Hand.â€”An incision may be made down the centre of the palm and crossed by another at the roots of the fingers, and the fingers and thumb may be laid open by means of an incision down the middle of each. The palmar branches of the median and ulnar nerves may be followed. The palmar aponeurosis is then to be exposed, and the firmness with which the skin is bound down to it will be noted. The central or principal part will be seen to expand towards the fingers; and at the further end transverse fibres will be observed binding its slips together [286]. A thinner part will be found dying away on each side over the region of the thumb and little finger, and care must be taken to preserve on the inner side of the hand the transverse fibres of the palmaris brevis muscle [281], extending transversely from the palmar fascia to the skin at the edge of the palm. Continuing the dissection down to the fingers, a view will be obtained of the synovial sheaths of the flexor tendons, covered in by vaginal ligaments [273] presenting almost cartilaginously strong transverse fibres opposite the first and second phalanges, and little more than some delicate crucial bands over the joints. Also the anterior digital nerves and arteries

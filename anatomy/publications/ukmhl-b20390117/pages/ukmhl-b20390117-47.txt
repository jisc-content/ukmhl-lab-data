DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 39 second phalanx, and of their lateral fibres into the third phalanx; and on clearing the expansions on the back of the first phalanges, and resuming the dissec- tion of the lumbricales, it will be demonstrated that those muscles are inserted into the extensor expan- sions, while other fibres will also be found coming from the interossei to join the expansions [278]. On raising the extensor digitorum communis, and turning it somewhat inwards, without dividing it, the five deep muscles will be brought into view, as well as the distribution of the posterior interosseous nerve and the artery of the same name [279, 280]. Four of the deep muscles emerge from beneath the extensor digitorum communis, namely, in series from below upwards, the extensor indicts passing through the sheath with the common extensor, the extensor secundi intemodii pollicis passing through a sheath by itself, and the extensores primi intemodii et ossis meta- carpi pollicis passing through a single compartment of the annular ligament : and higher up than any of these is the supinator brevis muscle embracing the neck of the radius. Piercing the supinator brevis, the posterior interosseous nerve has been already noted. It will now be found to supply branches to the supinator brevis, extensor carpi radialis brevior, ex- tensor digitorum communis, extensor minimi digiti, extensor carpi ulnaris and the extensors of the thumb and index fingers, and to terminate, after passing on to the back of the wrist beneath the tendon of the extensor indicis, in a gangliform swelling from which articular branches are distributed to the joints [522]. The posterior interosseous artery [441] comes into view

DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPEK LIMB. 1. The Back.â€”The subject being placed on its face, with the chest and pelvis supported by means of blocks, let an incision be made from the seventh cervical spine down the middle line to the most prominent part of the sacrum, another from the acromion to the upper end of the mesial incision, and a third along the crest of the ilium to the sacrum. If the subject be fat, it will be found convenient to dissect the integument of the flap thus formed care- fully separate from all the subcutaneous tissue; but if the subject be lean, it is quite possible to make a thoroughly clean dissection of the muscles at once, and at the same time save all the cutaneous nerves. Extending from the dorsal spines to the spine of the scapula will be found the lower portion of the trapezius muscle, while in the remainder of the region marked out by the cutaneous incisions is the latissi- mus dorsi [253-4]. In raising the fascia outwards from the middle line, the cutaneous branches of the posterior divisions of the spinal nerves will be detected as they emerge; and each, as it is found, may be followed through the fascia, or drawn out from it, while the

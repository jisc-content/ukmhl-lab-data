DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 117 two divisions of the fifth nerve, and the trunk of the nerve should be raised so as to get a complete view of the Gasserian ganglion [541] and of the motor root of the nerve passing under the ganglion to join the third or inferior maxillary division; but the artery should not be much interfered with, if the carotid and cavernous plexuses of the sympathetic are to be afterwards sought; and, indeed, the best plan is to leave the sinus on one side uninjured for that dissec- tion. The pituitary body [611] may be removed from the sella turcica and examined. By stripping the dura mater from the bone, the trunk of the middle meningeal artery, after entering the skull, may be brought into view [418], and in well-injected subjects, its branch entering the hiatus Fallopii, and the small meningeal branch entering by the foramen ovale, may be seen. The anterior meningeal artery entering by the side of the cribriform plate from the anterior ethmoidal artery, the posterior meningeal branch of the occipital artery entering by the jugular foramen, and the meningeal branches of the vertebral artery may also be sought. 14. The Orbit.â€”The frontal bone should be divided with the saw, either vertically or in a direction down- wards and outwards, so as to open into the orbit near its inner side, immediately external to the fovea trochlearis, and care must be taken not to direct the edge of the saw inwards lest the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve be injured as it passes through the anterior internal orbital canal. Another saw-cut should be made through the side of the skull, down- wards and forwards, to the sphenoidal fissure; the

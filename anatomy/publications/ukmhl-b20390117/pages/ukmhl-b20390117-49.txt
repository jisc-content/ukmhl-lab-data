DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 41 the three palmar interossei, arising each from the meta- carpal bone of the finger to which it belongs, and in- serted respectively into the ulnar side of the forefinger and the radial side of the ring and little fingers; and the four dorsal interossei, arising each from two meta- carpal bones, the first of them, the abductor indicis, being the muscle between whose heads of origin the radial artery passes forwards, while the two next are inserted one on each side of the middle finger, and the fourth is inserted on the ulnar side of the ring finger. 10. The Articulations.â€”Before proceeding to this dissection, a careful revisal should be made of all the parts which have been dissected and preserved; the various muscles may be divided, and the student may exercise himself in recognising the cut portions by means of their attachments. The joints are then to be examined in series from above downwards. In the coraco-clavicular articulation the conoid and trapezoid ligaments are to be distinguished, and the bursa between them is to be noted, as also the positions in which the ligaments are respectively tightened [151]. The acromioclavicular articulation should then be dissected, and studied in connection with the coraco-clavicular ligaments. Two ligaments passing across different parts of the scapula next demand attention, viz. the suprascapular ligament above the notch for the nerve of the same name, and the coraco-acromial or deltoid ligament; and the dissec- tor may then proceed to clear away the muscles which surround the shoulder-joint [152]. The insertion of the subscapular muscle will be seen to differ from the

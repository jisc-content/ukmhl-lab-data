42 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. others supporting the joint in that it pierces the capsule, and the bursa extending underneath the muscle communicates with the cavity of the joint where the capsule is pierced. An accessory or coraco- humeral band will be found strengthening the upper part of the capsule; and when the capsule has been studied the opening beneath the subscapular muscle may be enlarged to display the interior of the joint with the long head of the biceps muscle traversing it, and the glenoid ligament surrounding the scapular surface, and to allow the movements of the surfaces to be seen. At the elbow [155], the surface of the joint having been fully exposed, the orbicular ligament, binding the radius to the ulna, and the external and internal lateral ligaments, are to be dissected out; and then the membranes in front and behind, which are called anterior and posterior ligaments, but have no liga- mentous action, may be in great part removed, so as to permit of the relations of the surfaces of the bones in different positions of the limb being observed [157]. The interosseous membrane and oblique ligament [156] between the shafts of the ulna and radius may next be examined, and then the region of the wrist may be dissected [158-160]. Here, also, after observation of the outside of the joints, the ligamentous bands should be dissected out and openings through the weaker parts of the capsules should be made sufficient to allow the movements of surfaces to be seen. Thus, the lower radio-ulnar articulation may be opened in front, so as to exhibit the upper surface of the triangular fibropiate [156]; and openings in front and

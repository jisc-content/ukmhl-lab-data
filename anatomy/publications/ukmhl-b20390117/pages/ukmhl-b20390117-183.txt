DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 173 form the right and left triangular ligaments [689]; but in the region between these two ligaments it will be observed that there is a considerable depth of posterior surface where the folds from above and below do not meet; and this broad attachment is what is called the coronary ligament [689]. In the middle of the under surface the peritoneum does not pass back to the posterior surface of the liver, but is reflected more than half-way back, at the portal fissure, to the pylorus and commencement of the duodenum, so that a portion of the under surface is concealed. But on the right side of this reflection, between it and the posterior wall of the abdomen, is an opening, the foramen of Winslow, which admits the finger into a cavity ex- panding behind the stomach and bounded by the concealed part of the liver above [689]. The reflection of peritoneum in front of the foramen of Winslow is the gastro-hepatic or small omentum [690]; the concealed lobe of liver is the lobulus Spigelii [732]; and the cavity into which the foramen of Winslow expands is the sac of the great omentum, or smaller sac of the peritoneum [690]. This sac is now to be opened, and this can be done very effectually and without injury to any important structure by an incision four or five inches long immediately below the arteries running along the great curvature of the stomach. It will be found then that the sac of the great omentum descends into the pendulous peritoneum in front of the trans- verse colon, so that the peritoneum in question is simply a much elongated omentum or fold joining the stomach to the colon [690]. The continuation of the same layers from the colon to the posterior wall of

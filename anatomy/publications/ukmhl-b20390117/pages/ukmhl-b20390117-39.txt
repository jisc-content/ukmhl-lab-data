DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 31 a longitudinal cut may be made through the deep fibres of the triceps to expose the fasciculi inserted into the capsule of the elbow-joint and termed sub- anconeus. The musculo-spiral nerve [521] and superior profunda branch of the brachial artery should then be traced forwards through the external intermuscular septum, and followed down between the brachialis anticus internally and the origins of the supinator longus and extensor carpi radialis longior muscles on their outer side. The branches of the musculo- spiral to these two muscles and its twig to the brachialis anticus should be made out; and it may be at once traced down to its division on the upper part of the radius into a cutaneous nerve, the radial continuing downwards, and a deep nerve, the posterior interosseous, which is seen piercing the supinator brevis to reach the back of the forearm. Alongside of the musculo-spiral nerve and its divisions is the anasto- mosis of the superior profunda artery with the radial recurrent, and on the inner side of the brachialis anticus is the anterior ulnar recurrent artery ascending to meet the anastomotic artery. At a later stage the dissector will find the posterior recurrent branch of the ulnar anastomosing behind the internal epicondyle with the inferior profunda and anastomotic arteries, and behind the external epicondyle the recurrent branch of the posterior interosseous artery anastomosing with a branch of the superiw profunda [443]. The re- mainder of the space in front of the elbow, bounded inferiorly and internally by the pronator radii teres, should be brought fully into view, and the median nerve noted passing down internal to the bifurcation

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 155 entering from behind is the perineal branch [454] of the pudic artery. These three scrotal nerves are to be followed out after division of the fascia; and the perineal artery will be seen to give off the transverse perineal branch before passing forwards. In the space exhibited by removal of the deep layer of superficial fascia are seen, in the middle the bulb [780] covered over by the accelerator urince or bulbo- cavernosus muscle [390], and on each side the cms penis [780] clothed with the fibres of the erector penis or ischio-cavemosus muscle [391]; while behind, closely connected with the fascia where it dips deeply, is a thin muscular slip, the superficial transversus perinm [390]. These muscles are to be dissected out, and beneath them, when they are separated, will be seen the anterior layer of the subpubic fascia [395] or triangular ligament. On division of the anterior layer as close to the arch of the pubes as possible, and dissecting it towards the middle line, there will come into view the muscles and vessels and nerves situated between it and the deep layer [395]. The muscles are the deep transversus perinm [391], which is a small band directed out- wards and forwards from the central point of the perinaeum, and beneath it the transverse fibres of the constrictor urethral [391] passing partly in front of and partly behind the urethra. The continuation of the pudic artery, accompanied by small veins, and the dorsal nerve of the penis pass forwards between the layers of the subpubic fascia. Near the base of the triangular ligament will be seen the artery of the bulb [454] passing inwards from the pudic artery : it is

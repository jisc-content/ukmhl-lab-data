176 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. to a water tap, the jejunal end is to be fitted on to the tap, and water is to be run through them until the contents are completely washed away. They may then be arranged on a table and moderately inflated, so as to assist the study of the length of the different parts, the gradual diminution of the diameter of the small intestine from its commencement to its termination [717], the sacculation of the colon [723], the arrangement of its three longitudinal muscular bands, and the irregular disposition of the circular fibres by which the sacculation is determined. The ileum may then be divided about two or three inches from the caecum; a small portion may be removed from its lower end and inflated, and a similar portion from the upper end of the jejunum may be similarly inflated, and both parts may be hung up to be exam- ined when dried â€¢ while the remainder of the small intestine is to be slit open along the side by which it was attached, and immediately inspected. It may be slit either with the aid of a pair of scissors made with one of the blades long and blunt for that purpose, or with equal convenience this may be done by impaling a small piece of costal cartilage on one of the blades of a pair of ordinary dissecting scissors, and thrusting the blade so protected into the intestine. The student will then observe the greater development and fre- quency of valvules conniventes [719] in the upper part of the intestine and their disappearance below, also the much greater length and number of the villi in the upper than in the lower part, a circumstance which will be seen to advantage by placing portions of the intestine in water.

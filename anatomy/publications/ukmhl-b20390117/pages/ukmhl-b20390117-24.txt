16 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. dissection being made of the lowest insertions of that muscle; and to show the upper part of the multifidus spinae, ascending as high as the axis, the semispinalis must be divided in its whole extent. The multifidus spinae by dissection inwards from its outer attach- ments may be shown to consist of a series of fan- shaped parts • the outer fibres are most superficial and pass over several vertebrae, deeper fibres are shorter, while the deepest of all in the thoracic region extend between contiguous vertebrae and are called rotatores spince [362]. After the study of these, the levator es costarum [367], small muscles extending out- wards and downwards from the extremities of the dorsal transverse processes, and connected with the fibres of the external intercostal muscles, claim atten- tion. In series with the levatores costarum, in the lumbar region, are the external intertransverse muscles, between succeeding transverse processes, while a set of internal intertransverse muscles will be found pass- ing from accessory to mammillary processes [362]. Typical intertransversales muscles also exist in the neck; interspinales muscles are to be found in the neck and in the lumbar region. 2. The Spinal Cord.—Senior dissectors may now proceed to exhibit the spinal cord by opening the spinal canal. The laminae of the vertebrae are to be denuded; the head is to be allowed to hang over the end of the table, and the concavity of the lumbar part of the vertebral column is to be straight- ened as much as possible, by means of blocks under the abdomen. The laminae of the lumbar and thoracic regions are then to be divided partially with

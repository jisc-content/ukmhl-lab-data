DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 61 verse and round ligaments, and the surfaces of the joint [186-189]. Sometimes it is preferable instead of dissecting the hip-joint in this way, to saw through the femur and leave this joint to be dissected by the dissectors of the pelvis, who will have an opportunity of opening into it from the deep surface of the in- nominate bone, so as to show the action of the round ligament without injury to the capsule. 4. The Back of the Leg.â€”The limb having been separated from the trunk, an incision is to be made down the back of the leg as far as the heel, and the integument reflected. In the superficial fascia of the calf, the terminal branches of the small sciatic nerve will be found [531]. On removal of the subcutaneous fat the external and internal saphenous veins will be brought into view as far as the ankle [485-486]. The external passes behind the outer malleolus, accom- panied by the external saphenous nerve [533], whose double origin has been already noticed, and whose inner root lies at first beneath the fascia lata in the furrow of the gastrocnemius muscle. The internal or long saphenous vein passes in front of the inner malleolus in company with the nerve of the same name; and the terminal branches of the internal cutaneous nerve will be found on the inner side of the leg. The aponeurosis of the limb being removed, the muscles of the calf are seen, namely, the gastrocnemius [311], and underneath it the soleus [313] appearing at the sides. When it has been cleaned, the gastrocnemius may be divided near its upper part and its heads of origin may be separated and dissected closely up to the

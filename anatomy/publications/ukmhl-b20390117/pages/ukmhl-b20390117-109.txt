DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 99 the dissection of the inferior division of the posterior triangle proceeded with. The external jugular vein is to be followed to its termination in the subclavian vein, which may also be cleaned in the outward direction; the transverse cervical artery [431] with its vein will be next found crossing outwards; the scalenus anticus muscle is to be cleared, with the phrenic nerve [513] on its surface; and emerging from beneath the outer border of that muscle will be found in series, from above downwards, the two upper trunks of the brachial plexus [514], and the subclavian artery [428]. Arising from the front of the upper trunk the small nerve to the subclavius muscle is to be dissected out [516]. The upper trunk of nerve will be seen to be formed by the union of the fifth and sixth, while the second consists of the seventh nerve; the artery will be seen to curve over the apex of the pleural sac; and in many instances the posterior scapular artery [431], usually reckoned as a division of the transverse cervical, will be noticed arising from it in the space. Behind the clavicle will be found the suprascapular artery and vein. 8. Anterior Triangle.â€”The surface of the sterno- cleido-mastoid muscle [351] should now be completely cleaned, as well as the muscles in front, viz., the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and anterior belly of the omo-hyoid [350]; and at the same time care should be taken of the branches to these muscles from the loop formed by the hypoglossal nerve with communications from the cervical plexus [560], as also of the various layers of fascia in the middle line. A layer of fascia will be found extending forwards from the anterior

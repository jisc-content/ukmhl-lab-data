DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 145 and pulmonary veins [410] are to be exhibited and studied in detail. The right and left coronary arteries [411] are then to be dissected out and their origins from the aorta displayed, the right one arising from the right sinus of Valsalva [403] and sending a branch along the posterior interventricular sulcus, the left arising from the left or anterior sinus of Valsalva and giving off at its commencement a branch which descends in the anterior interventricular sulcus. In close con- nection with these arteries will be found the coronary plexus [566], in which the cardiac nerves ramify before they descend on the surface of the ventricles. Also, in the auriculo-ventricular sulcus are the coro- nary veins and sinus [468]; and on slitting up the sinus beneath the left auricle, the pair of valves will be seen by which it is guarded at its commencement. One tributary of the coronary sinus, entering it from above, the oblique vein of Marshall [468], is specially interesting, as being the vestige of a left superior vena cava in early foetal life. The right auricle is to be laid open by cutting and turning down a flap from the anterior wall, care being taken in making the incision not to approach too closely the opening of the lower vena cava, lest injury be done to the Eustachian valve [402] on the anterior and inner side of the orifice. Within the right auricle [401], the most important points to notice are the fossa and annulus ovalis on the septum between the auricles, the auriculo-ventricular opening, the open- ing of the coronary sinus placed between the auriculo- ventricular opening and back part of the vena cava inferior and guarded by the valve of Thebesius, smaller K

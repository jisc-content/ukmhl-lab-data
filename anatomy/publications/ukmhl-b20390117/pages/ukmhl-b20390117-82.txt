72 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. thoroughly exposed, are now to be followed out, and the bursse connected with them are to be studied. The vasti and crureus muscles are to be dissected as separate as possible from the underlying superior and lateral walls of the joint, and the ligamentum patellce is to be brought out clearly [191], the bursa between it and the tibia being laid open and attended to the more particularly, as it is liable to inflam- mation, which is more frequently than ordinary ' housemaid's knee' confused with inflammation of the joint. The external lateral ligament [189] is to be dissected out, and in connection with its long cylin- drical portion the tendon and bursa of the popliteus, lying between it and the femur, as also the small bursa between its fibular end and the insertion of the biceps. The flat and long internal lateral ligament is next to be dissected, and beneath it the anterior insertion of the semimembranosus with a bursa round it in the groove of the tibia. The two other insertions of the semimembranosus tendon are then to be followed, one taking part in forming the pos- terior ligament, the other expanding into the aponeu- rosis over the popliteus muscle. This aponeurosis being removed, the popliteus muscle [314] will be seen in its continuity. The joint may then be opened from above, in front of the lateral ligaments; and projecting into the interior will be found redun- dant synovial membrane resting on a pad of fat (so-called Haversian gland) below the patella, with the ligamentum mucosum stretching from the middle of this projection to the fossa between the condyles of the femur, and two edges called alar folds [192]

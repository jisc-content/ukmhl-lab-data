112 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. internal lateral ligament [244] of the temporo-maxillary articulation, or the spheno-maxillary ligament. Fur- ther forwards the artery gives off muscular branches, namely, the deep temporal, pterygoid, and masseteric [419]; and these are to be exhibited. Also in this space are to be seen various branches of the inferior maxillary or third division of the fifth nerve [546-548]:â€”two of these appear above the external pterygoid muscle, namely, the masseteric already iden- tified, from which a posterior deep temporal springs, and the middle deep temporal to the temporal muscle; piercing the external pterygoid is the buccal nerve already alluded to, destined to supply the mucous membrane internal to the buccinator muscle and the skin upon its surface, and giving off on its way an anterior deep temporal branch ; and appearing beneath the external pterygoid are two larger trunks, the anterior of which is the gustatory or lingual branch, while the posterior is the inferior dental, and is seen to enter the inferior dental canal, and, before doing so, to give off the mylo-hyoid branch, the termination of which has been already seen. Subjacent to these trunks the internal 'pterygoid muscle [343] is seen emerging from beneath the external pterygoid and passing downwards and backwards to the angle of the jaw. The course of the inferior dental canal may be laid open with the nippers, so as to display the nerves and arteries going to the teeth. The remaining part of the ramus of the jaw is now to be divided, and the temporo-maxillary articulation is to be studied. This cannot be done perfectly; for to study the whole anatomy and movements of

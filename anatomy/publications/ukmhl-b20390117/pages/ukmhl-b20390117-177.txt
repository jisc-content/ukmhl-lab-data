DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 167 Poupart's ligament to be inserted into the inner part of the ilio-pectineal line, with its free edge abutting on the crural canal [383]. 3. The Testicle and its Coverings.â€”The scrotum is to be laid open from the front, and the student should satisfy himself that its coat of involuntary muscle, the dartos [772], already seen to be con- tinuous with Colles's fascia in the perinaeum, is con- tinuous also with Scarpa's fascia in the groin [392]. The cremaster muscle [378] is to be followed down over the testicle. Its fibres are connected by fascia, and besides those already seen passing down from Poupart's ligament, there is a smaller set extending up to the pubes, partly continuous by arches with the outer set, and partly taking origin from below; but this inner part of the cremaster is inconstant and variable. Laying open the cremasteric tunic, the dissector will seek the genital branch [526] of the genito-crural nerve supplying the cremaster, also the cremasteric artery [456], a small branch of the epigastric. He will then follow the infundibuliform fascia downwards, and show its continuity with the fascia propria [771] of the testicle, and will proceed to dissect separate the elements of the spermatic cord [771]. The vas deferens [776] is recognised by its toughness, which gives it the feeling of whipcord; and the spermatic artery [451], the plexiform tributaries of the spermatic vein [481] and the spermatic nerves [567], will be easily distinguished. Also, in close connection with the vas deferens is the deferent artery [453], a small branch derived from the superior vesical.

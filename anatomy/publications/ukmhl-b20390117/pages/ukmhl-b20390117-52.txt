DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 1. The Gluteal Region.â€”The subject being placed on its face, with blocks under the pelvis, an incision is to be made from the middle line outwards, along the crest of the ilium, but not so deep as to reach down to it or divide the nerves which cross it. Another, commencing at the same point, is to be carried to the lower end of the sacrum, then out- wards, so as to reach a point about six inches below the great trochanter. The largest cutaneous nerves of this region, after crossing down over the crest of the ilium, lie between the superficial adipose tissue and a distinct deeper layer which fills up the hollow between the crest of the ilium and the upper border of the gluteus maximus muscle. The nerves thus descending are two or three branches from posterior divisions of lumbar nerves [510], which cross outside the margin of the erector spinse muscle, and in front of them the lateral branches of the ilio-hypogastric [525] and last dorsal [524] nerves. Still further forwards, below the anterior superior spine of the ilium, may be found some twigs of the posterior branch of the external cutaneous nerve of the thigh

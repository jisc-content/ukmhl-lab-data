DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 69 the upper and stronger passing superficial to the extensor hallucis and embracing the tibialis anticus. The upper part of the aponeurosis of the leg had better be removed from below upwards, as it gives origin on. its deep surface to muscular fibres. The four muscles of the front of the leg are now to be dissected fully out [308, 311]. Two of them are seen in the whole extent of the leg, namely, the tibialis anticus internally, and the extensor digitorum longus externally ; continuous with the lower border of the latter is the origin of the peroneus tertius, and arising deeply between the two longer muscles is the extensor hallucis longus. Lying deeply on the inter- osseous membrane are the anterior tibial vessels and nerve : the artery [462] will be seen piercing the membrane from behind, and immediately giving off a recurrent branch to the knee, while near the ankle it gives off an external and an internal malleolar branch. The nerve [536] may be traced back through the fibres of the extensor digitorum longus, and down- wards beneath the anterior annular ligament to the foot. It distributes branches to the four muscles upon the front of the leg and divides upon the dorsum of the foot into two branches, an external, enlarged at its termination like the posterior interosseous nerve of the arm, and supplying branches to the extensor digitorum brevis and the articulations of the foot, and an internal, cutaneous in its distribu- tion. Beneath the peroneus tertius will be found, piercing the interosseous membrane, the anterior peroneal artery [465]. On the foot, after the tibialis anticus and pero-

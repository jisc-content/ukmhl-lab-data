90 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. close to the corpus callosum lies the callosal convolution or fore part of the classical gyrus fornicatus. These two convolutions are separated from one another by the calloso-marginal fissure, which when traced back- wards is found to turn upwards and terminate on the edge of the hemisphere in front of the precuneus or quadrate lobe, which intervenes between it and the parieto-occipital fissure. From the lower end of the parieto-occipital fissure, the calcarine fissure is seen extending backwards, and the angular surface between the two is the cuneus. Continuous with the anterior extremity of the calcarine fissure the anterior calcarine extends down- wards and forwards. It bounds externally the posterior part of the old gyrus fornicatus, now dis- tinguished as the gyrus hippocampi, which, coursing beneath the back of the corpus callosum, lies between the inferior temporal gyrus and the crus cerebri^ separated from the latter by the transverse fissure of the brain, and swells in front to form the bulbus hippocampi with the uncus on its concealed side. 5. Dissection of the Brain from above.â€”This dissection is made best on a preserved specimen, or on a brain in situ ; but if the brain be in the recent condition, and has already been examined from below, care must be taken in turning it over so as not to allow the hemispheres to fall separate and tear the internal parts. Within the great longitudinal fissure the disposition of the arachnoid and pia mater is to be noted ; the corpus callosum will be seen at the bottom of the fissure, and over it the anastomoses of the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries.

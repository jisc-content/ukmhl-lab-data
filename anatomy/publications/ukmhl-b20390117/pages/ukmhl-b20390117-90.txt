80 DISSECTION OF* THE HEAD AND NECK. Passing obliquely upwards and outwards from the spine of the axis to the transverse process of the atlas is to be seen the obliquus capitis inferior muscle, and passing up from the transverse process of the atlas to the skull is the obliquus capitis superior; extending upwards from the spine of the axis to the occipital bone is the rectus capitis posticus major, while partly under cover of it and partly visible on its inner side is the rectus capitis posticus minor extending to the occipital bone from the posterior tubercle of the atlas. The great occipital nerve [510] is seen passing over these muscles; and in the triangular space left between the obliqui and recti muscles will be found the sub-occipital nerve [509] emerging above the atlas, and giving off branches to all four muscles, and the vertebral artery [428] passing inwards over it. Should the above dissection be completed in the first two days, the dissector may employ the remain- ing two days before the subject is turned either in dissecting the brain or the orbit. 2. Exposure and Removal of the Brain.â€”The brain may be removed, with the subject placed either on the back or on the face; and, although the position on the back is that more frequently chosen, there is good authority in favour of the position on the face, and it is questionable that it does not afford as much facility as the other. The process of ex- posure is the same in either case. In the post-mortem examination of a body to be afterwards seen by the friends of the deceased, it is advisable to divide the scalp by an incision from ear to ear, so that the appearance of the face shall not

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 191 observing that fibres of the levator ani muscle are always continued up above the white line to be attached along with the pelvic fascia to the horizontal ramus of the pubic bone, and that therefore the pelvic fascia is a structure internal to the levator ani, while the obturator fascia is external to that muscle, and independent of the pelvic fascia. It is convenient to describe an upper or undivided part and a lower or recto-vesical, but the student should distinctly understand that the lateral and anterior true liga- ments of the bladder are simply the vesical and prostatic portions of the recto-vesical fascia. The part of the brim of the pelvis left for the display of the attachment of the undivided pelvic fascia is to be removed with the bone-nippers or saw. The manner in which the recto-vesical fascia splits up to invest the rectum and bladder, together with the prostate gland in the male and the vagina in the female, is to be examined; also the anterior fibres of the levator ani are to be fully dissected out so as to show their position between the anterior ligament of the bladder and the posterior layer of the subpubic fascia [394]. If the bladder be partially inflated through one of the ureters, and a little tow be introduced into the rectum and vagina, the examination of the investment of these viscera with fascia will be facilitated, and the distribution of the visceral branches of the vessels and nerves better shown. The internal iliac artery will be seen to give off from the origin of the obliter- ated hypogastric artery the superior vesical branch, and, lower down, the inferior vesical to the lower part of the bladder and the vesicube seminales and prostate,

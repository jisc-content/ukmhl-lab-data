128 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. [348], and of the middle constrictor to the stylo- pharyngeal [341], are to be shown. After the dissection of the outside of the pharynx has been completed, the interior is to be brought into view by an incision extending down the middle, and another carried transversely close to the skull. The posterior nares, the pillars of the fauces, with the tonsils between them, the glottis, the oesophagus, and the Eustachian tubes opening above the soft palate, are to be studied [709]. The muscles of the soft palate are then to be dissected [347-349]. First, the view of the levator and tensor jpalati should be com- pleted. The relation of the levator to the mem- branous floor of the Eustachian tube will be seen, and the student can judge for himself if there be any possibility that the extremity of that tube can be open, as is often alleged, when the muscle is swollen by contraction [675]. Also the course of the tendon of the tensor or circumflexus palati round the hamular process, and its insertion in part into the hard palate should be seen. From the extremity of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube the few fibres termed salpingo- pharyngeus will be seen to descend when present, and running clown the uvula the levatores uvulae. If the palate and tongue be now pulled in opposite directions, and the wall of the pharynx kept on the stretch with pins, the parts will be in the position most favourable for the display of the two muscles on each side descending from the palate, namely, the palato-glossus in front of the tonsil, and the palato- pharyngeus [348] spreading out behind to the middle line of the pharynx. After these muscles have been

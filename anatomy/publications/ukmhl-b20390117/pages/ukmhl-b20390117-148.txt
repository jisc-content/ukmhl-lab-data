DISSECTION OF THE THOEAX. 1. The Parietes.â€”As soon as the upper limbs have been removed by the dissectors of those parts, the dissection of the thorax may be commenced. The external intercostal muscles [365] should be displayed in as great a part of their extent as possible; and they should be dissected away from some of the intercostal spaces, so as to show the direction of the internal intercostal muscles [366] beneath them. Also the intercostal nerves [523] of the upper six spaces should be followed between the muscles, and with them the intercostal arteries [446], each with its collateral branch running along the upper border of the rib below; and the anastomoses of these arteries with the anterior intercostal branches of the internal mammary [431] should be made out. On the left side the course of the internal mammary artery superficial to the triangularis sterni [370] may be exhibited by the removal of the second and four succeeding costal cartilages; then, in order to exhibit the relations of the pericardium and pleural cavities to the thoracic walls, the corresponding costal cartilages of the other side may be divided close to the ribs, and the ribs on

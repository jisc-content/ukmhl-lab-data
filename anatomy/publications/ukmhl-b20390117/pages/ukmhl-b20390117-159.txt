DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 149 size of the right bronchus and the more descending course of the left are to be noted, and the arrange- ment of their cartilages. The bronchial tubes are then to be followed as far as possible through the substance of the lung, and the mode of branching noted, as well as the gradual change in character of the cartilages, which at first are arranged so as to keep the tubes thoroughly open; then degenerate into mere scattered nodules. The trachea [745] should be dissected from behind. The fibrous coat should be laid open, and beneath it will be found numerous separate little glands, which send their ducts through the subjacent muscular coat to the mucous membrane. The connections of the muscular coat with the cartilages are to be exhibited, and the mucous membrane is then to be divided, and its glandular orifices and longitudinal markings noted. The bronchi and succeeding tubes should be examined by slitting them open to show the mucous membrane. Sections should also be made through healthy portions of the lung, to familiarise the eye with the appearance of the vessels and bronchial tubes in section, and the framework of connective tissue between the lobules; and the lightness of the tissue may be tested by throwing portions into water. 5, The (Esophagus and other Parts.â€”The struc- tures in the posterior mediastinum [686] now demand further attention. The descending aorta [445] and termination of the left vena azygos [480] can be more fully displayed, the oesophagus [709] can be properly cleaned, its curves can be seen, and the right and left pneumogastric nerves [558] can be exhibited on it.

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 113 this articulation it is necessary to devote the head of a young adult subject specially to the purpose, But the external lateral ligament and the capsule and interarticular cartilage can be seen [244], and also that the forward movement of the condyle in opening the mouth is a consequence of the mode of attachment of the external lateral ligament, and that the condyle takes the interarticular cartilage forwards with it. In disarticulating the joint, care is to be taken to keep the knife close to the capsule, so as not to injure the auriculo-temporal nerve [547]. The external pterygoid muscle may then be reflected forwards, and its nerve may be found, after which the muscle may be altogether removed. This allows the auriculo-temporal nerve to be traced out from its origin from the inferior maxillary trunk; also the chorda tympani [551] joining the gustatory nerve at an acute angle from behind, and the middle meningeal artery [418] passing up to the foramen spinosum, and giving off the small meningeal branch which enters by the fora- men ovale. The ptery go-maxillary ligament [356] separating the buccinator muscle from the superior constrictor should also be studied. 12. The Sublingual Region.â€”The tip of the tongue should be laid hold of and pulled forwards; and it is sometimes convenient to retain it in that position by means of a stitch attached to the nasal septum : if, however, this common, though unneces- sary expedient be resorted to, the tongue should be replaced in its proper position as soon as the dissection has been made, that the natural relations of parts in the floor of the mouth may be understood.

DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 59 view with the anterior division of the obturator nerve upon its surface, and the course of the profunda femoris artery [459], and the origins of its perforating branches may be studied. When these have been examined, let the adductor brevis be divided, and now the posterior division of the obturator nerve [526] will be seen, and the branches of the obturator nerve to all the adductor muscles can be made out. The internal circumflex artery [459] is to be followed, and will be seen giving off branches, distributed in the adductors brevis and gracilis and the obturator externus muscle, and anastomosing with the obtu- rator artery : it divides terminally into an ascending and a transverse branch which have already been seen from behind. The obturator externus muscle [291] is also to be cleaned, its relation to the hip-joint noted, and the distribution of the obturator artery [453] outside the pelvis examined. A small branch to the hip-joint will be seen to enter the joint at the notch of the acetabulum, given off either by the internal circumflex or by the obturator artery. The adductor magnus muscle is now to be examined in its whole origin, insertion and disposition, and may be divided. The rectus femoris is next to be divided, and the examination of the quadriceps ex- tensor cruris completed : first, the vastus externus is to be dissected back from its free anterior edge to its origin from behind; secondly, an incision is to be carried up through the vastus internus from the middle of its free inferior margin, so as to show both the interval of bare bone extending the whole length of the shaft of the femur, between the origin of this

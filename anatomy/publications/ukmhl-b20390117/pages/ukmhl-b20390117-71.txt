DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 63 and the dissection carried into the substance of the muscle so as to exhibit the remarkable arrangement of the short muscular fibres. The tendo A chillis [314] or common tendon of insertion of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, is to be dissected closety down to the calcaneum, and the bursa between it and the upper part of the calcaneal tuberosity is to be dis- played. The bulk of the gastrocnemius and soleus ma}^ then be removed. The fascia covering the deep layer of muscles is now fully seen, and is to be removed; when, on the fibular side will be found the flexor hallucis longus, on the tibial the flexor digitorum longus, and between them and partially covered by an aponeurotic connection joining those two muscles, the tibialis posticus [315, 317]. Descending superficial to the tibialis posticus and flexor digitorum longus are the posterior tibial artery [464] with its venae comites and the posterior tibial nerve [533]. In the upper part of its course the nerve furnishes branches to the three deep muscles and one to the soleus, and at the ankle a cutaneous branch which sends twigs to the heel, and passes on to the sole. The posterior tibial artery gives off' near its origin the peroneal, and also furnishes various small branches, namely, the nutrient artery of the tibia, a branch communicating with the peroneal near the ankle, and muscular branches. The peroneal [465] artery will be seen to pass beneath the flexor hallucis longus, and to be surrounded by its fibres close to the fibula, and to give off, besides muscular twigs, the nutrient artery of the fibula, the anterior 'peroneal perforating the interosseous membrane near

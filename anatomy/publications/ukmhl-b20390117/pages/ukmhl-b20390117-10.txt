.2 THE USE OF INSTRUMENTS. the cutting edge extending in a straight line to the point, is sometimes found in dissecting cases, and may be of use in physiological experiments; but to the practical anatomist it is of no service save for one purpose, namely, following branches of nerves; and for this the only requisite is a sharp point, which every scalpel should have. Dissecting forceps should be sufficiently weak in the spring to be used for a length of time without wearying the fingers. Lower down they should be strong, and they should taper gradually to the points. At the points it is unnecessary for them to be nar- rower than one-sixteenth of an inch, as the smallest structure can be grasped and managed with facility with forceps of that breadth of point, provided that the teeth or serrations where the points are in apposition are fine and fit into one another with perfect accuracy. Forceps need not be more than four and a half inches in length. The mode of handling the scalpel and forceps is a matter of importance, on which the success and comfort of the dissector greatly depend. The forceps ought always to be held lightly between the forefinger and thumb, their upper part moving over the forefinger. Never, on any account, should this instrument be grasped in the palm of the hand like a fork, neither should it be used to lay hold of firm and bulky structures, which can be better held with the fingers. Small branches of nerves may be seized with it without harm, but neither muscles nor arteries should ever be so seized. These structures are seriously damaged by being pinched, and should,

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 115 stylo-glossus muscle [340]; diverging from the stylo- glossus in a downward direction is the stylo-pharyngeus muscle [341]; and curving forwards over that muscle is the glosso-pharyngeal nerve [553]. On dividing the hyo-glossus muscle, the lingual artery [415] can be followed forwards, giving off the superior hyoid, the dorsal artery of the tongue, and the sublingual branch, and ending in the ranine artery to the tip of the tongue. In front of the place where the gustatory nerve descends into the sublingual region, the attach- ment of the superior constrictor of the pharynx to the jaw is seen [346]. 13. Parts within the Cranium.â€”The head is to be well raised with blocks, so as to bring the interior of the base of the skull conveniently into view (Fig. 357). The place at which each cranial nerve pierces the dura mater is to be noted, and also the attachments of the divided falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli, and the mesial process of dura mater beneath the tentorium, called falx cerebelli [578]. The superior longitudinal sinus [475], along the upper border of the falx cerebri, already opened in part of its extent, is to be followed down to the level of the tentorium, where it ends in the torcular Herophili [476], and divides into the two lateral sinuses. Along the inferior border of the falx cerebri is the inferior longitudinal sinus, which has more the charactei of a vein than of a sinus. On reaching the tentorium this sinus is joined by the vein of Galen (vena magna Galeni), which was cut across in removing the brain; and the blood from these two sources flows to the torcular along the straight sinus in the angle of union

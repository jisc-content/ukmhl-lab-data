18 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. scalpel beneath it; and when it has been laid open, the cord is seen closely invested with its vascular sheath, the _pia mater, and terminating in the filum terminate, a silvery thread which will be found among the trunks of the cauda equina, and is to be followed to its attachment [580 and 582]. By dividing the cord and dura mater above, and the nerves as they leave the spinal canal, the whole may be removed and spread out for further examina- tion. Some at least of the nerve-roots should be followed through the dura mater to show the relations of the two roots to the ganglia; and sections may be made through the cord at different levels [580-583]. Within the spinal canal after removal of the cord, the rich plexus of veins should be noted [478]. 3. The Pectoral Eegion and Axilla.â€”The subject having been turned on its back, and the shoulders supported by a block so as to throw the chest for- wards, a mesial incision is to be made along the sternum; from the upper end of this another is to be carried to the outer end of the clavicle, and thence to the fold of the axilla ; while a third is to be directed transversely from the lower end of the sternum as far as the border of the latissimus dorsi. If the subject be a female, a circular incision with a radius of an inch is to be described round the mammilla, so as to leave that part intact when the rest of the integument is raised. The extent of the mamma is to be exhibited by removal of the sur- rounding adipose tissue; and on raising the circular portion of integument till it is left attached only at the extremity of the nipple, the galactophorous ducts,

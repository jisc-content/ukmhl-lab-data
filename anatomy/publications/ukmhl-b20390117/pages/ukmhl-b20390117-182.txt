172 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. by the position of the obliterated hypogastric artery; the part above the bladder, between the two obliter- ated vessels, forming the anterior false ligament; the more horizontal portions, where the vessels are in contact with the bladder, forming the lateral false ligaments; and the ascending parts beneath the contact of those vessels being termed the posterior false ligaments [692]. In the female, on each side of the uterus, the peritoneum forms what is called the broad ligament or ala vespertilionis [692], bifurcating into an anterior part containing the Fallopian tube, and a posterior part acting as mesentery to the ovary and the round ligament of the ovary. After noting these points a pad of cloth or tow moistened with spirit may be pressed into the recto-vesical fossa, that the parts may be dry and firm before the time arrives to dissect them. Attention is next to be given to the ligaments of the liver. The transverse colon is to be returned to its natural position, and the hand is to be thrust back above the liver, when the whole upper surface of that organ will be found to be clothed with peritoneum, and the peritoneum thrown into two fossae by the falciform or suspensory ligament [689], in the free edge of which is a fibrous cord, the obliterated umbilical vein [495, 6891 coming up from the umbilicus. Then turning to the under surface of the liver, it will be seen that it is clothed with peritoneum back to its posterior margin at the two sides, and at the right extremity and along the posterior border of the left lobe the peritoneum meets back to back with the folds proceeding from the upper surface, so as to

54 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. the inferior falciform process terminates, and which is continued underneath the femoral vessels, is what is termed the pubic portion. The limits of the saphenous opening having been examined, its outer border may be divided, when the femoral artery and vein surrounded by the femoral or crural sheath will be fully brought into view; and if two incisions be made through the sheath, one over the artery and another more internally over the vein, these vessels will be seen to occupy separate compartments, while on the inside of the vein a third compartment short and blind will be found containing often a small lymphatic gland; and it is this third compartment which is termed the crural canal, and is the part distended by the descent of femoral hernia [383]. Inserting the tip of the little finger into this canal, a firm resistance will be felt on the inner side, which is caused by the margin of Gimbernafs liga- ment [376]. The integument may now be reflected from the rest of the thigh and from the surface of the knee- joint, and the subcutaneous fat should be removed in a direction from above downwards, so as to bring the cutaneous nerves into view without injuring them as they emerge from the fascia lata. A little below the anterior superior spine of the ilium the external cutaneous nerve [526] will be found emerging in two parts, the anterior a couple of inches below the posterior, and supplying the outer side of the thigh. On the fore part of the thigh, about four inches or more below the groin, the middle cutaneous branch [527] of the anterior crural appears, usually divided

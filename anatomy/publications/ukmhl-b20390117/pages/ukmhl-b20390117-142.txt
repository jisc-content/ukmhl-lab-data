132 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. from the deep aspect may now be made on the side left intact. The pterygo-maxillary fossa should then be opened into by removal of the ascending plate of the palate-bone piecemeal with the aid of bone-nippers and scissors; and the descending branches of Meckel's ganglion [545] should be followed to their distribution in the palate. The large palatine branch will be found descending with the superior or descending palatine artery, a branch of the internal maxillary artery; while the small or posterior palatine nerve and the external palatine occupy the small canals of the same names. A dissection may now be made, as before directed, of the remaining ear. 17. Vertebral Muscles and Articulations.â€”It remains for the dissector to examine the muscles attached to the vertebrae. The scaleni muscles still remain uninjured: the anterior has been already seen; and, of the fibres behind the position of the subclavian artery, those attached to the first rib constitute the middle [353], and those proceeding to the second the posterior scalenus [354]. Nearer the middle line, in front of the vertebrae, is the rectus capitis anticus major ascending to the skull; and under cover of it the rectus capitis anticus minor [354]; while between the recti and scaleni and the middle line is the longus colli muscle [354]. Ascending from the transverse process of the atlas is the rectus capitis lateralis [355]. If the muscles behind the vertebrae have not yet been dissected, they ought to be examined now according to the directions already given (pp. 79, 80). The vertebral muscles are to be cleared away, and

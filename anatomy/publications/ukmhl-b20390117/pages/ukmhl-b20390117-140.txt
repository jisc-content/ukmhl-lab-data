130 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. torini) will be seen surmounting the arytenoid cartilages, and the cuneiform cartilages of Wrisberg producing a swelling in the epiglottidean fold in front of them [739]. The form of the cartilages of the larynx is to be studied, and the crico-arytenoid and crico-thyroid articulations [740] and the movements which they permit. The remains of the tongue are to be removed, the thyro-r^oid membrane and lateral ligaments are to be examined, and the epiglottis [739] is to be dissected out so as to show its form and connections at the base. To see the remaining muscles of the larynx, the greater part of one half of the thyroid cartilage may be removed by a vertical incision near the middle line, carried down to about a line from the lower border, and another directed backwards from this, when the upper attachment of the crico-thyroid muscle [742] will be seen more fully. The fibres of the lateral crico-arytenoid muscle [742] will be observed converging to the outer angle of the arytenoid cartilage, and, above it, passing backwards to the base of the same cartilage, the thyro-arytenoid muscle [743] occupying the fold in which the vocal cord is situated. Both muscles will be seen to rest on an elastic structure connected with the crico-tlryroid ligament and the true vocal cord, namely, the crico-thyro-arytenoid mem- brane [740]. If now the mucous membrane above the true vocal cord on the side so far dissected be removed, a good view of the folds of the true and false vocal cords of the opposite side, and the ventricle between them, will be obtained, with the saccule ex- tending from the fore part of the ventricle [742].

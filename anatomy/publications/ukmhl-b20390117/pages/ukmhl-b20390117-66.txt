DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 58 hip-joint. Above the hip-joint the posterior or reflected tendon of the rectus femoris is again seen [299], and the whole of this muscle may be now dissected out and the direction of its fibres noted. The three other parts of the quadriceps extensor cruris [300] are to be displayed, namely, the vastus externus and internus, with their fibres directed downwards and forwards, and the straight-fibred crureus between the vasti and partly covered by them. Along with the muscles on the outside of the thigh there ought also to be dis- sected the ascending, transverse, and descending branches of the external circumflex artery anastomosing with the gluteal and perforating arteries and with the articular arteries around the knee [459]. The branches of the anterior crural nerve [527] may now be dissected out continuously from the parent trunk, and will be seen to fall naturally into two groups, a superficial cutaneous set whose only mus- cular branches are those to the sartorius, and a deep set which, with the exception of the internal saph- enous branch, is entirely muscular, supplying the pectineus and the different parts of the quadriceps extensor femoris. The branch to the vastus internus also gives off an articular branch to the knee which descends on the internal intermuscular septum with a branch of the anastomotica magna. The accessory obturator nerve [527], when present, passes over the brim of the pelvis, internal to the great vessels, to aid in the supply of the pectineus muscle. The pectineus and adductor longus are next to be divided and dissected well up to their attachments. The adductor brevis [295] will thus be brought into

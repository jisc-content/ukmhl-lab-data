DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 137 fore part of the sclerotic, with the cornea, may then be detached as in the former dissection, if the dissector chooses. The choroid [650] is next to be removed^ It can be torn away easily in shreds, the rents taking a direction from before backwards determined by the course of the arterioles which constitute an important part of its structure. A view will thus be obtained of the retina [656] in its position on the surface of the hyaloid membrane surrounding the vitreous humour [661]; and on removing the retina, the vitreous humour, the lens and the transparent membranes will be obtained intact. If the student has been careful in his manipulations, a dissection similar to either of those above described may be made in the eyeball of the subject. The sclerotic and cornea may be thoroughly examined, and the ciliary nerves may be traced. The choroid, iris and ciliary muscle may be displayed; and when the eyeball is opened, the lens with its capsule and the Iryaloid can be easily separated. The retina, however, as a rule cannot be exhibited.

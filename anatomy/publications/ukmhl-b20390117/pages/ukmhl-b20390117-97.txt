DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 87 away as soon as their relations to the nerves have been noted. On laying open the fissure of Sylvius, the gyri operti, insula, or island of Rett [624], will be brought into view, lying in the bifurcation of the fissure, and bounded in front and behind by the orbital and tem- poral convolutions, and externally by the lower frontal [625], a convolution which has received much atten- tion in the history of the malady known as aphasia. The origins of the olfactory tract [630, 631] are next to be noted. The lower portion of one or both of the anterior lobes may then be pared away so as to exhibit the reflected part of the corpus callosum lying in the longitudinal fissure, and terminating in two peduncles directed backwards and bounding the lamina cinerea, a delicate part of the floor of the brain, descending to be attached to the upper surface of the optic commissure [594]. Behind the optic com- missure, the contents of the rhomboid space claim attention: namely, from before backwards, the tuber cinereum or lamina of which the infundibulum is a prolongation, the corpora albicantia, the posterior per- forated spot, and the third pair of nerves. The fourth pair of nerves [595, 539] and the optic tracts may at this stage be followed round the crura cerebri to their origins by raising the cerebellum carefully; but they will be seen more fully afterwards from above. The fifth nerve is seen emerging from the pons Varolii in two parts, the small motor root placed higher up than the larger or sensory portion. Between the pons and the medulla oblongata is to be found, close to the middle line, the sixth nerve; and further out-

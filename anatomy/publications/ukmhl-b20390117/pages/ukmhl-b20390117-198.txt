188 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. inwards and removed. At the central point of the perinaeum [388] there will be found converging the superficial sphincter ani [389] disposed as in the male, the sphincter vagince [391] extending round the orifice of the vulva (representing the accelerator urinse muscles of the male), and the [390] superficial transverse muscle disposed as in the male. On each side of the rectum the ischio-rectal fossa [395] is to be cleaned out, to show the inferior hemorrhoidal and superficial perinatal branches of the pudic artery [454] and nerve [532] coming to the surface through a considerable depth of fat inside the ischial tuberosity, and the pudendal branch [531] of the small sciatic turning inwards in front of the tuber ischii to accompany them. Still removing the fat, the dissector will find the fossa to be bounded, as in the male, internally by the levator ani [388] with a layer of anal fascia [395] on its surface, externally by the obturator fascia [394], and in front by a barrier formed by the deep layer of superficial fascia, attached at the sides to the arch of the pubes, dipping in to join the triangular ligament [395], which in the female is divided mesially by the vulva. In the anterior part of the perinseum beneath the superficial fascia just mentioned will be found the crura of the clitoris [791] arising from the pubic arch and embraced by erector muscles [391] like the corresponding structures in the male. More inter- nally, a highly complicated plexus of veins, bnlbns vestibuli [792], invading the nympha or labium minus [790], will be found extending forwards to unite with its fellow in forming the glans clitoridis [792]; these plexuses correspond to the corpus spongiosum in

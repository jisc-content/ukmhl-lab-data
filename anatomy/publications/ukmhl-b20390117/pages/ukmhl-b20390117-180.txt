170 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. the transverse colon [726] crosses the front of the abdomen; and between it and the great curvature of the stomach is the pendulous great or gastro-colic omentum [690], sometimes hanging down over the colon and small intestines, and sometimes crumpled up in small bulk. Following the transverse colon to the right, and turning the small intestines a little to the left, the student will see the hepatic flexure [726] where the ascending colon is continued into the trans- verse, and behind this he will feel the right kidney; and pursuing the ascending colon downwards, he will find the intestinum ccecum [724], consisting of caput ccecum coli and vermiform appendage [725], in the right iliac region. Let him observe the termination of the small intestine in the csecum, turn the transverse colon and great omentum upwards, and follow the small intestine up from the termination of the ileum, throw- ing it to the right side till he arrives at the commence- ment of the jejunum [718], which he will recognise from its being the uppermost portion of the small intestine separated by mesentery from the abdominal wall. At this point he will see half the breadth of the last inch or so of the duodenum [717] crossed by the commencement of the mesentery; and he will do well to trace without injury to the peritoneum the partially concealed course of the duodenum between the pylorus and its termination at this point. First, he will note the terminal part of the duodenum referred to as seen on the left of the mesentery; then turning the mesentery to the left he will see a portion on the right side between it and the colon, and above the colon he will see the first part of

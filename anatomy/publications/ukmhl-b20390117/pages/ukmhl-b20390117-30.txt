22 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. thoroughly into view; and also the origins of the anterior and posterior circumflex arteries [435] given off immediately below the subscapular. The remainder of the pectoralis major is to be divided about three inches from its insertion, and as the pectoralis minor is brought into view, some twigs of the internal anterior thoracic nerve [516] may be seen piercing that muscle and passing on to the pectoralis major. There are likewise laid bare by the reflection of the pectoralis major the common origin of the coraco-brachialis muscle and short head of the biceps from the coracoid process external to the pectoralis minor, and further out, in the bicipital groove of the humerus, the rounded tendon of the long head of the biceps [263]. The pectoralis minor [259] having been cleaned and studied is to be divided, and the internal anterior thoracic nerve is to be found entering its deep surface, and is to be traced back to its emergence on the under side of the axillary artery. The internal and external anterior thoracic nerves will be found to be united to one another by a branch crossing in front of the artery. The whole course of the axillary vessels can now be cleared, and their relations to the trunks of the brachial plexus, above, behind and beyond the pectoralis minor, studied [514]. All the branches of the axillary artery already individually mentioned can be seen in series, and the three great cords of the brachial plexus giving off their branches as follows : the external cord (outside the vessels) giving off the external anterior thoracic, the musculo-cutaneous, and the outer head of the median â€¢ the inner cord (inside the vessels) giving off

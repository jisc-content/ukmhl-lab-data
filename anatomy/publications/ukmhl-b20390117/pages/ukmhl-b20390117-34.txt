26 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. muscle, occupying the fossa supraspinata, is to be dissected out in its course beneath the acromion, which, however, does not interfere with its exposure. It is then to be raised from its origin, and the supra- scapular nerve and artery are to be followed beneath it, where, after supplying it, they pass behind the neck of the scapula into the infraspinatus muscle. The infraspinatus is to be likewise raised, and the dorsal branch of the subscapular artery [435] followed, as it ramifies beneath it. Lastly, the subscapularis muscle [261] is to be dis- sected from its origin; the tendinous septa attached to ridges of the subscapular fossa are to be noted; and the bursa connected with the shoulder-joint [153] and situated between the muscle and the neck of the scapula is to be examined. 5. Subcutaneous Structures of Arm and Forearm. â€”As a general rule, it is advisable to make a longi- tudinal incision down the front of the limb, and to remove the integument at once as far as the wrist, so as to get a continuous view of the subcutaneous veins and nerves throughout this region; but some- times the imperfect preservation of the part, or other reasons, may suggest the expediency of leaving the forearm untouched until after the brachial dissection is completed. When the skin as far as the wrist has been reflected, it will be well, before attempting to remove the subcutaneous fat, to trace the intercosto- humeral nerve to its distribution, if this be not already done; then to follow the nerve of Wrisberg {lesser internal cutaneous) from its origin from the internal brachial cord [517, 518] to its termination between the

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 109 from the incisor fossae of the lower jaw, and then making a mesial incision through the integument of the chin but leaving the lip undivided, when their fibres will be seen spreading downwards and inwards towards the surface. The depressor labii is to be divided, and beneath it there will be seen emerging from the mental foramen the mental branches of the inferior dental artery [419] and nerve [547], the artery a branch of the internal maxillary, and the nerve a branch of the third division of the fifth. Beneath the depressor anguli oris and anastomosing with the mental artery is the inferior labial branch [416] of the facial. The lips ought now to be everted as much as possible, and held in that position while the mucous membrane is dissected off so as to show the labial glands [701] like small lentils, and the deep surface of the orbicularis oris muscle [333]. In this manner the attachments of the musculi incisivi [333] to the upper and lower jaws can be displayed, and the coronary branches of the facial artery, completing a circle round the mouth, may be laid bare. Lastly, the cartilages of the nose should be dissected, so as to display the form of the alar cartilages and their dis- tinctness from the triangular and septal cartilages [639]. 11. Temporal and Zygomatic Region.â€”Let the branches of the facial nerve be traced back through the parotid gland, and the main trunk followed up to the stylo-mastoid foramen. The two little branches given off at that point, viz., the auricular branch and the nerve supplying the stylo-hyoid muscle and the posterior belly of the digastric, should also be found

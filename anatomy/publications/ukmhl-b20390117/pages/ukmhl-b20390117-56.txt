48 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. membranosus [292-294], from which that muscle takes its name, coming from a facet of the tuberosity higher up than, and external to, the combined origin of the two other hamstring muscles, and covered by it as it passes down. Close to the insertion of the gluteus maximus the first perforating branch of the deep femoral artery [460] will be found upon the surface of the adductor magnus muscle. The deep branches of the gluteal artery, passing- forwards beneath the gluteus medius, may be taken as a guide for the separation of that muscle from the gluteus minimus which it conceals; and the gluteus medius [289] may be separated from the ilium, so as to show the extent of its origin as far forwards as the position of the body renders convenient; but its most anterior part is to be left to be dissected when the subject is turned. The superior and inferior deep branches of the gluteal artery [455] will thus be exposed; and the superior gluteal nerve [531], a branch from the lumbo-sacral cord, will be seen to supply the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, and to send a branch further forward than can at present be traced, which will afterwards be followed into the tensor vaginae femoris. The gluteus minimus [289] should be detached from the ilium in the same manner as the gluteus medius, to show the extent of its origin; and beneath it, on the upper border of the acetabulum, will be seen the posterior tendon of the rectus femoris muscle, which, however, will be better studied after the subject is turned. In contact with the femoral attachment of the lower border of the quadratus femoris is the upper

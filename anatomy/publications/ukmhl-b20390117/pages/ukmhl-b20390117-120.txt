110 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. [551]. The parotid gland is then to be removed : its intimate connection with the terminal part of the external carotid, and the origin of the internal maxillary and temporal arteries, will in doing this be noted, as well as its relations to muscles [706] and to the part of the cervical fascia known as the stylo-maxillary ligament [356] which extends between the lower part of the styloid process and the angle of the jaw, with its lower edge the more superficial, and so intervening between the parotid and sub- maxillary glands as to separate them completely even when much enlarged. The temporal fascia [344] is now to be laid bare, and an incision is to be made along the upper border of the zygoma, so as to show that the temporal fascia is divided here into two layers with fat between them, among which lies the temporal branch [544] of the superior maxillary nerve, the terminal branches of which have been already noted. The fascia is then to be completely divided so as to lay bare the temporal muscle. The masseter muscle [342] is to be properly cleaned, and its artery [419] and nerve [546] may be found as they emerge from the sigmoid notch of the lower jaw and enter its upper and back part, where a portion of the deep division of the muscle is left uncovered by the superficial. The zygomatic arch is to be divided with the bone-nippers as far forwards and as far back as possible, namely, in front of and behind the origin of the masseter; and the masseter is to be reflected downwards and separated from the greater part of the ramus of the jaw. so as to show the extent of its

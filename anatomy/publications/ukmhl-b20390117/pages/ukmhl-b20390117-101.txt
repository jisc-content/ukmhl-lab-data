DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 91 large knife, after wetting the blade, the hemispheres are now to be cut horizontally across, a very little above the level of the corpus callosum, and then the remaining grey matter of the callosal convolution is to be removed, so as to lay bare the whole upper surface of the corpus callosum. Note the transverse direction of its fibres, the longitudinal mark termed raphe in the middle line, and the elevations on each side called nerves of Lancisi, the thick posterior border or splenium, and the genu or curve downwards in front [616]. By means of two longitudinal incisions, one on each side of the corpus callosum, open into the two lateral ventricles separately, cutting away as much of the substance of the hemispheres as is necessary to show the whole extent of the floor. The lateral ventricles [620] will then be seen to be separated one from the other toward the front by the septum lucidum, while, further back, their internal margins retreat from the mesial plane, and in the floor of each will be seen from before backwards the corpus striatum, with the foramen of Monro internal to it [620], a delicate band called stria terminalis, the anterior and outer part of the optic thalamus [609], the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle, and a moiety of the sheet of white brain substance called the fornix [618]. The cul-de-sac in front is the anterior cornu [620] of the lateral ventricle. The posterior cornu, extending back in the posterior lobe, is to be laid open in its whole length, and on its inner side will be seen an elevation, the hippocampus minor, which may be shown to correspond with the calcarine fissure. The middle or descending cornu is marked by

118 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. ascending process of the malar bone should be divided with the bone-nippers; the piece of bone between the saw-cuts is then to be separated by a smart blow of the mallet and turned forwards or removed without injury to the facial structures on its surface; and the unroofing of the orbit, back to the cavernous sinus, should be completed by further use of the bone-nippers. The dura mater investing the contents of the orbit is then to be split open, and the frontal branch [541J of the ophthalmic nerve will be seen passing forwards and dividing into the supra- trochlear and supraorbital, which may be followed into continuity with the facial dissection. Also, passing forwards in the middle will be seen the levator palpebrce muscle [335] going forwards to the tarsal plate of the upper lid, and the superior rectus muscle of the eyeball [334] immediately below it. A little internal to this is the superior oblique muscle [335], which is to be followed forwards to its pulley at the fovea trochlearis of the frontal bone, and is to be traced thence to the eyeball. Near the back part of this muscle by its outer edge and on its upper surface the fourth nerve [539] will be seen entering it, and this is to be traced back into continuity with the dissection in the cavernous sinus. Externally to the frontal nerve the lachrymal branch of the ophthalmic division of the fifth is to be found and traced forwards to the lachrymal gland [645] at the upper and outer part of the eye; it will be found to give a com- municating twig to the temporal branch of the temporo-malar, and to send branches forwards to the outer half of the upper eyelid.

134 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. taken for a repetition on a perfectly fresh human eye. The eye of an infant is perfectly suitable. If a weak solution of bichromate of potash be used, such as may be obtained by shaking a crystal for a moment in water till it gives it a straw colour, and an aperture be made in the sclerotic to admit the solution into the interior, the dissection will be facilitated, and the specimen may be preserved in spirit afterwards without further loss of transparency of the vitreous humour than serves to exhibit the hyaloid mem- brane ; but the outer layers of the lens are rendered opaque. Specimens thus prepared have remained without deterioration for many years. A preliminary view may be obtained by making a transverse vertical section of one eye, which may be done by piercing through the sclerotic and other tunics half-way back, and dividing them round about with the scissors. In the posterior part will be seen the sclerotic [647] tinted on its deep surface with brown connective tissue, the membrana fusca [647]; inside this, the choroid coat [650], much more loaded with pigment in the ox than in the human subject; internally, the retina [656]; and between retina and choroid the pigmented hexagonal epithelium [655], which, in a bichromate of potash preparation, will often separate in scaly patches like tinder. The retina is seen to be firmly attached at the optic pore [656], and from this the retinal artery branches out. In the human eye the yellow spot of Sommering (macula lutea) is seen in the axis of the eye [656], its yellow colour contrasting with the delicate pink of the rest of the retina; in the ox eye there is no such

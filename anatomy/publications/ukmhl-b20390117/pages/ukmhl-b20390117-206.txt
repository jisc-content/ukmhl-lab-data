196 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. floor, a little elevation called wrumontanum with a minute cul-de-sac in the fore part of it called the sinus ^ocularis or uterus masculinus; immediately in front of this the openings of the ejaculatory ducts, and in the hollow at the sides of the verumontanum the openings of the tubules of the prostate. Within the bladder are specially to be noted the valvular openings of the ureters, and the space between these and the neck, termed the trigone [769]. In the female, the bladder and urethra are to be slit open from above, and the trigone [769] examined as in the male. The vagina [793] is to be cut open by an incision carried along one side, and its rugae are to be examined: they are most prominent in the lower parts, especially in front. The os uteri [786] projecting into the upper end of the vagina will next attract attention, and will be found to vary from various causes, such as age and child-bearing; but in the virgin its aperture is transverse and the anterior lip the more prominent. The uterus [786] is to be examined, and is to be cut open from the front, the incision bifurcating above, so as to show the cavity of the cervix with its ribbed mucous membrane, the os internum, the smooth mucous lining of the uterine cavity, and the termination of the Fallopian tubes at the upper angles [786, 787]. The Fallopian tubes [789] and ovaries [783-785] are to be studied, and the ovarian division of the liga- mentum latum is to be held up to the light to look for the little transverse tubes in its folds, which constitute the parovarium or organ of Rosenmiiller [789].

146 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. openings of veins called foramina Thebesii, and the musculi pectinati of the anterior wall and appendix. The right ventricle may now be conveniently opened by an incision a little to the right of the anterior interventricular sulcus, from which another may be carried along by the inferior border of the auriculo-ventricular sulcus, care being taken not to injure the anterior cusp of the tricuspid or right auriculo-ventricular valve. The convexity of the interventricular septum, the infundibular extension upwards to the pulmonary artery, and the way in which the cavity falls short of the apex having been noted, the other peculiarities of this ventricle will be better studied by comparison with the left. The left ventricle may be opened after the same fashion as the right, by means of an incision along the base, and another from the front of this directed to the left of the apex, so as to expose both the anterior and posterior musculus papillaris without injury [405]. The cusps of the mitral or bicuspid valve can then be studied, when it will be noted that the chordce tendinece of adjacent margins of cusps are gathered together to their corresponding musculus papillaris, and that the chordae tendineae arise at different levels on the backs of the cusps. The passage up to the aorta is on the right side and in front of the right cusp. Turning again to the right ventricle [404], the student will be able to contrast with the mitral valve the three cusps, anterior, posterior, and mesial, of the tricuspid valve, united by a connecting fringe at the base, and will appreciate the comparative irregularity of the chordae tendineae and columnae carneae of the

102 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. tributaries of the external and internal jugular by means of the facial communicating is to be noted [471]; after which it may be convenient to divide the exter- nal jugular. Also, behind the sheath of the great vessels the cervical part of the sympathetic cord will be seen; but it may be advisable to leave its careful dissection till later. The first branch of the external carotid artery to be followed is the superior thyroid [415]. Its offset to the sterno-mastoid muscle some- times comes off separately from the main trunk; another offset, the superior laryngeal, will be seen piercing the thyro-hyoid membrane; and piercing along with it is the superior laryngeal nerve [556], which may be traced back towards the pneumo- gastric. The other offsets of the superior thyroid artery, namely, the inferior hyoid and the crico-thyroid, having been shown, the termination of the artery in the thyroid body is to be exhibited, and the thyroid body [756] should be dissected fully out, so as to show the whole lateral lobe, the termination of the inferior thyroid artery [430] and the superior and middle thyroid veins [470]. The lingual artery [415] at present can be followed no further than the point where it becomes concealed by passing beneath the hyo-glossus muscle. Immediately above it is the facial artery [416], whose two first branches, the ascending palatine and tonsillar, can now be displayed at their origins. The ascending pharyngeal branch [415] of the external carotid may also be shown at its origin by raising the trunk. Coming off from the external carotid behind are the occipital and posterior auricular [417]; the occipital, crossed by the hypo-

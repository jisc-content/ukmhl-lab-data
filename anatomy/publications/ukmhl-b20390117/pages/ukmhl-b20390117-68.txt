60 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. muscle and the crureus, and the insertion into the aponeurosis constituting the surface of the crureus ; and thirdly, another incision is to be made vertically through the crureus to display not only the inferior limit of its origin, but also the few fibres underneath it attached to the ascending part of the synovial membrane of the knee-joint, and termed subcrureus. The obturator externus [291] and psoas and ili- acus muscles [301] may now be divided, and between the common tendon of the last two muscles and the capsule of the joint a large synovial bursa is to be noted, The capsule of the hip-joint is now to be dissected; its deficiency at the back part can be easily brought into view by flexing and abducting the femur, and its strength in front is to be noted, where it has added to it the ilio-femoral and ilio-trochanteric ligaments constituting together the Y-shaped ligament descending from the anterior inferior spine of the ilium, its inner fibres directly downwards, and its outer fibres, as far outwards as the base of the great trochanter; and it will be seen that it is in connection with this most important ligament that the anterior intertrochanteric line is so rough [187]. The relations of the head of the femur to the acetabulum in differ- ent positions of the limb are to be noted in connection with the subject of dislocations of the joint, namely, its projection forwards in extension with the toes turned outwards, together with the variation caused by adduction, and its projection backwards on turn- ing the toes inwards, with the variations according to the degree of flexion and adduction. The capsule is afterwards to be opened to show the cotyloid, trans-

32 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. of the brachial artery, while the ulnar artery inclines inwards and crosses beneath the median nerve, sepa- rated from it by the deep head of origin of the pronator teres, and the radial artery inclines outwards towards the radial nerve. Lastly, the precise extent and attachments of the brachialis anticus [264] should be made out. 7. Front of the Forearm.â€”On removal of the aponeurosis of the limb from this region there come into view on the outside the remainder of the supin- ator longus [275] muscle and the radial nerve [522], and artery [441] internal to it, the artery giving off above, under cover of the muscle, the radial recurrent, which anastomoses with the superior profunda, and, at the wrist, the superficial volar to the hand and a small anterior carpal branch. Occupying the rest of the forearm is seen a group of five superficial flexor muscles descending from the internal epicondyle of the humerus [270]. Of these the outermost is the pronator radii teres, previously brought partially into view : its insertion on the outer side of the radius, as well as the deep ulnar head of origin which separates the median nerve from the ulnar artery beneath it, can now be fully studied. Internal to this muscle are found in series from without inwards, the flexor carpi radialis, the palmaris longus (which, how- ever, is often absent), the flexor digitorum sublimis, and the flexor carpi ulnaris. Of these the flexor sublimis is the largest, and it will be seen to have an additional origin from the radius, along by the lower border of the pronator teres : its four tendons where they pass beneath the anterior annular ligament at

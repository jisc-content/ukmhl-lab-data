12 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. their nerve [515], as it passes beneath their upper border; and when those muscles have been divided by a vertical incision near their vertebral extremity, this nerve (a branch from the fifth cervical), together with the posterior scapular artery [43]], may be seen in its continuity by the dissectors of the head and neck and upper limb together. The peculiar tendin- ous attachment of the rhomboideus major to the scapula is to be exhibited from the deep side. On the posterior border of the scapula the insertion of the levator anguli scapulw [256], and on the upper that of the omo-hyoid [350] should be exhibited; and the supra- scapular artery and nerve [431, 516] may be noted as they pass respectively above and below the supra- scapular ligament, but will be better seen in a later dissection. The latissimus dorsi is to be divided by an in- cision beginning at its upper border, two inches from the mesial line, and curving downwards and out- wards to the outer border an inch below the last rib. Let the inner part be then raised, so as to exhibit the connection with the lumbar aponeurosis [365] and the origin from the crest of the ilium; and in raising the outer part, let the costal slips of origin be brought into full view, as well as their interdigitation with the external oblique muscle [376] of the abdomen. Also dissect out the posterior border of the external oblique muscle between the last rib and the ilium and the small portion of the internal oblique [377] left uncovered by the external; and note the continuity of the lumbar aponeurosis with that on which the internal oblique muscle is seen resting, namely, the

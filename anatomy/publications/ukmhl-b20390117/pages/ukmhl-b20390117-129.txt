DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 119 A quantity of fat may now be removed most effectually and rapidly by moving the scalpel back- wards and forwards with its edge directed to one side, so as to push the fat with the flat of the blade and isolate it from the important structures lying more or less longitudinally. Crossing the optic nerve will be seen the ophthalmic artery [421] giving off the lachrymal and supraorbital at the back of the orbit. As it crosses the optic nerve, it gives off a series of minute branches, the central artery of the retina and the ciliary arteries; further forwards it sends ethmoidal branches into the anterior and posterior internal orbital foramina and branches to the muscles; and in front it ends in palpebral, nasal, and frontal branches. The external rectus muscle is to be thoroughly exposed so as to show its two heads of origin [335]: and between these are to be found the other nerve- trunks entering the orbit, namely, in series from above downwards, the upper division of the third nerve, the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, the lower division of the third, and the sixth nerve [539, 542, 549]. On the outer side of the optic nerve the len- ticular ganglion [543] is to be found with its long root from the nasal nerve, as well as a branch from the sympathetic entering it from behind, and its short root from the inferior division of the third nerve coming up from below, while its branches of distri- bution, the short ciliary nerves, extend forwards and pierce the sclerotic. The nasal nerve [542] is to be traced forwards to the anterior internal orbital fora- men by which it leaves the orbit. It crosses the optic nerve, and gives off the long root of the ganglion,

DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 17 the saw, care being taken to direct the saw somewhat inwards, so as not to divide the transverse processes instead of opening into the spinal canal. The saw- cuts ought to be continued downwards and made to meet near the lower end of the sacrum, and the portion of sacrum between them should be raised with the chisel. By then using the bone-nippers alternately on the right and left side, beginning below in the lines of the saw-cuts, and passing up to the neck, where the long laminae and wide spinal canal render the saw unnecessary, the whole series of laminae may be removed in a continuous chain united by the ligamenta subflava. The extensibility and resiliency of the ligamenta subflava will thus be exhibited [123]. The sheath of dura mater, with its prolongations round the nerves, can now be cleared with the handle of the scalpel so as to show the spinal ganglia, and in some instances (most conveniently in the lower dorsal region) the nerves may be traced out to show their bifurcation into anterior and posterior divisions. The dura mater [576] is to be carefully opened by slitting it down the middle; and then will be seen the origins of the spinal nerves in pairs by anterior and posterior roots, the ligamenta denticulata binding the cord to the dura mater in the spaces between the successive nerves, and the delicate arachnoid membrane [578] surrounding the spinal cord. The loose transparent sheath which the arachnoid forms round the cauda equina, or collected bundle of lumbar and sacral nerve- roots, can be exhibited advantageously with the aid of the blowpipe, or by introducing the handle of the B

106 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. of the eye is the infratrochlear nerve [543] and the nasal branch [422] of the ophthalmic artery. Extending upwards from under cover of the orbicularis palpe- brarum is the frontalis muscle, or frontal belly of the occipito-frontalis lost in aponeurosis extending over the cranium [330]; and its innermost fibres are prolonged downwards on the nose to form the pyramidalis nasi [332], which differs from the frontalis in having its fixed attachment below. On reflecting the frontalis the corrugator supercilii [331] will come into view attached to the inner end of the superciliary ridge, and extending upwards and outwards in an expanded form for a considerable distance in close connection with the deep surface of the frontalis. Farther out, on the temporal region, will be found the ramifica- tions of the temporal artery [417] with the branches of the auriculo-temporal division [547] of the inferior maxillary nerve, and in front of this the uppermost of the terminal branches of the facial nerve [551], emerging from underneath the parotid gland and directed towards the forehead and angle of the eye- lids. The temporal twig of the temporo-malar nerve [544] is to be sought for on the surface, about an inch above the zygoma and about the same distance behind the margin of the orbit. Also at this time the attrahens and attollens auriculam muscles [330], in front of and above the ear, are to be dissected, if not already seen in the dissection of the back of the scalp. If the incision above the ear be now prolonged downwards in front of it to join the dissection in the neck, the remaining integument of the face may be

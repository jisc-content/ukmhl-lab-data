DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 107 removed from behind forwards toward the middle line. The outline of the parotid gland [706] prolonged a little over the jaw, with the duct (Stenson's) extend- ing forwards from it to enter the mouth, is to be brought into view; also the little outlying portion of the gland termed socia parotidis, and the transverse facial branch [418] of the temporal artery above the duct, and the various remaining trunks of the facial nerve issuing from beneath the anterior border of the gland and diverging as they pass forwards [551]; also the minute malar twig of the superior maxillary nerve emerging from a foramen on the front of the malar bone [544]. The continuation of the platysma myoides is to be followed over the jaw, and its posterior fibres may be traced to the angle of the mouth, forming the risorius muscle of Santorini [333]. Two muscular slips, the zygomaticus major and minor [332], are next to be exhibited descending from the malar prominence to the angle of the mouth; and internal to them, arising beneath the orbit and crossed by the facial artery is the levator proprius labii superioris [332], with the outer border of which the zygomaticus minor is usually connected. More internally is the levator communis labii superioris alceque nasi [332]; and on the side of the nose is the terminal twig of the nasal branch [542] of the fifth nerve, emerging between the bone and car- tilage and descending under cover of the compressor naris muscle; while lower down is the very small depressor alee nasi [332], arising from the incisor fossa and inserted into the septum and back part of the ala of the nose. The course of the main trunks of the

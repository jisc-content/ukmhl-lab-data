DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 35 running down the sides of the fingers, after escaping from underneath the palmar fascia, may be at once dissected out; and note should be taken of the Paci- nian bodies [81] coming off like minute bunches of grapes from the nerves, and usually capable of being easily distinguished from the fat in which they are imbedded. On reflection of the palmar aponeurosis, the super- ficial palmar arch of artery [444] and the median and ulnar nerves [520, 517] will be laid bare. From the ulnar artery is given off a deep branch [441], which sinks down between the muscles of the little finger. The superficial palmar arch will be found to be con- tinuous with the ulnar artery, and to be completed by anastomosis with the superficial volar branch of the radial, and to give off the digital branches for the three inner fingers and ulnar side of the fore- finger ; while the thumb and radial side of the forefinger are supplied from the radial artery. Both median and ulnar nerves will be seen giving off muscular branches soon after entering the palm ; and care must be taken not to divide these when fol- lowing the nerves onwards to the digits. The median nerve divides into five digital branches, one for each side of the thumb, a third for the outer side of the forefinger, and a fourth and fifth branch each splitting up to supply respectively the adjacent sides of the fore and middle fingers and those of the middle and ring fingers. The little finger and inner side of the ring finger are similarly supplied by the ulnar nerve. It may be here shortly stated that the muscular branches of the median nerve supply the

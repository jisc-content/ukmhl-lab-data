DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 67 plantar. The abductor hallucis will be distinguished by having its fibres collected to a distinct tendon on the inner side of the great toe; the flexor hallucis brevis lies next it, narrow behind, and inserted in two heads, connected with the two sesamoid bones of the ball of the toe; the adductor hallucis, placed to the outside of the short flexor, crosses the sole obliquely, concealing to a considerable extent the interossei; and the transversus pedis lies transversely, arising close to the heads of the metatarsal bones, and must not be destroyed in dissecting out the plantar arteries which pass forwards on its deep or dorsal surface. The flexor minimi digiti brevis will be easily distinguished from the abductor by being fleshy and arising from the fifth metatarsal bone. The flexor brevis and adductor hallucis are now to be divided, and the exact extent of their origins is to be carefully made out. A complete view of the plantar arch will thus be obtained, showing its inosculation in the first interosseous space with the dorsal artery of the foot. Its four digital branches to the three outer interdigital spaces and the outer side of the little toe will be seen, and also the three posterior perforating branches passing up through the three outer interosseous spaces [466]. In the first interosseous space will be found the arteria jprinceps hallucis [464], usually coming off from the termina- tion of the dorsal artery of the foot, but sometimes continuous rather with the plantar arch; it supplies the adjacent sides of the first and second toes and the inner side of the great toe. The interossei muscles will be better dissected at a later stage.

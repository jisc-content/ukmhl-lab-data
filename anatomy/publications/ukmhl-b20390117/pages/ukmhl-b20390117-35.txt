DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 27 olecranon and inner epicondyle of the humerus; also to trace the internal cutaneous branch of the musculo- spiral nerve [521] from its origin near the axilla to its distribution on the posterior surface of the arm. One or two branches will also be found springing from the internal cutaneous nerve near the axilla and ramifying on the inner side of the upper arm. The subcutaneous fat should then be removed with care in a direction from above downwards, so that the other cutaneous nerves may be detected and preserved as they escape from the aponeurosis of the limb; and we shall suppose this to be done as far as the wrist. On the inner side of the arm about the middle, the internal cutaneous nerve [517] pierces the aponeurosis, either as a single trunk or after division into its two branches, anterior and posterior. On the outer side, a cutaneous branch of the circumflex nerve, already noted, is to be found at the posterior border of the deltoid muscle, and lower down, in the line of the external intermuscular septum, appear the two external cutaneous branches of the musculo-spiral nerve [521]. In front, at the bend of the elbow, the musculocutaneous or external-cutaneous nerve [517] appears by the outer side of the tendon of the biceps. At the back, over the olecranon, is a synovial bursa which sometimes becomes inflamed; and on the inner side there is usually a small lymphatic gland. In the forearm, on the outer side, in front, will be found the distribution of the anterior branch of the musculo- cutaneous, and in the upper part the terminal twigs of the upper external cutaneous branch of the musculo- spiral nerve, while, behind, the posterior branch of the

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 171 the duodenum continued from the pylorus. If now the jejunum be again turned to the right, and the peritoneum be carefully divided transversely above the termination of the duodenum, a broad fibrous band, ligament of Treitz [718], descending from over the left cms of the diaphragm to be attached to the intestine at this spot, will be brought into view. Returning to the transverse colon, let it be followed to its splenic flexure; behind this let the position of the left kidney be observed; then follow the course of the descending colon down to the sigmoid flexure, and the sigmoid flexure into the rectum [727]. Eaising the small intestines out of the pelvis, sponge away any grumous fluid which may be collected there, and examine the position of the bladder, the depth of the recto-vesical fossa [692], and, in the female, the uterus and the ovaries, with the Fallopian tubes in front of the latter, and the deep parts of the round ligaments of the uterus [fig. 611]. In examining the position of the viscera, so far as has been now recommended, the student cannot have failed to note much of the disposition of the peri- toneum, particularly below the level of the transverse colon; but it is necessary to give it more special study. Gathering the small intestine in his hands, he will satisfy himself of the extent and direction of the line of attachment of the mesentery to the abdom- inal wall [692], and will observe to what extent the ascending and descending colon, sigmoid flexure, and rectum are clothed. Then turning to the bladder, he will see that at its sides and above it the peritoneum is thrown into folds determined, in some measure,

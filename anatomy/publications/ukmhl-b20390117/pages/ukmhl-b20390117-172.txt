162 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. ness of the posterior wall of the sheath, frequently described as total absence. The lower margin of the strong upper portion of the posterior wall of the sheath, which, it will be noticed, corresponds pretty closely with a line drawn between the most prominent parts of the iliac crests, is called the fold of Douglas [381]. The deep epigastric artery enters the sheath a little below the fold of Douglas, and at the place where it enters there are often to be noticed two diverging aponeurotic bands, one passing inwards towards the pubes, and the other passing downwards and outwards external to and continuous with the conjoined tendon, close to the margin of the deep abdominal ring [384]. The deep inguinal dissection is now to be proceeded with. The lower portion of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle is to be raised with the handle of the scalpel from the parts beneath, and is to be divided by an incision continued immediately outside the sheath of the rectus muscle down to the pubes. The external and internal pillars of the super- ficial abdominal ring will thus be brought more fully into view, so that their attachments may be studied, together with the inter columnar fascia [377], a thin membranous sheath continued from the margins of the ring, down on the surface of the spermatic cord in the male, and less distinctly developed in the female. Beneath the portion of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle now reflected, fibres of the internal oblique muscle, taking origin from the upper two-thirds of Poupart's liga- ment, extend inwards, the upper fibres lying in a

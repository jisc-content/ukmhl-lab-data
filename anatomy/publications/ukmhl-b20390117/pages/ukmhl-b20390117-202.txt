192 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. and, below this, the middle hemorrhoidal to the lower part of the rectum; and in the female there are, in addition, a uterine and a vaginal branch, the one ascending and the other descending on the side of the viscus from which it is named [453]. Besides these branches, the internal iliac gives off a number of others, namely, the obturator [453] accompanying the nerve of the same name, but sometimes replaced by a branch from the epigastric; the pudic [454] quitting the pelvis by the great sciatic notch, beneath the pyriformis muscle, and re-entering below the spine of the ischium, and now to be followed in its course bound down by the obturator fascia till it terminates in the dorsal artery of the penis and artery of the corpus cavernosum; the sciatic [453] likewise passing below the pyriformis; the gluteal [455] emerging above the pyriformis; the ilio-lumbar [455] dividing into lumbar and iliac branches which anastomose with the last lumbar and circumflex iliac respectively; and the lateral sacral [455] descending on the sacrum and giving off branches which enter the anterior sacral foramina. In following the branches of the internal iliac artery, the dissector will meet with the principal trunks of the sacral plexus [530]. He will see the formation of this plexus by the union of the lumbo- sacral cord [531] with the anterior divisions of the three upper sacral nerves, and part of the fourth; much the greater part of the plexus joining to form the great sciatic nerve [532], which with the small sciatic, inferior gluteal [531], pudic, and one or two smaller branches, emerges below the pyriformis. He

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 177 follicles, agminated glands [721], will also be seen in the ileum, if the subject is favourable; in any case the form of the patches, about a third of an inch in breadth, marked out by depressions which the follicles occupied, will be seen. 6. The Cceliac Axis and the Viscera supplied by it.â€”On turning the stomach upwards, there will be found arising from the front of the aorta below the narrow entrance into the lesser sac of the peritoneum a short artery, the cceliac axis [448], dividing into the hepatic, splenic and gastric arteries. These are to be exhibited only so far as may be done without injury to the sympathetic nerves accompanying them; and to make the dissection with comfort, it will probably be necessary to nip the lower ribs across. The gastric artery or coronary artery [449] of the stomach may be dissected first; it is the uppermost of the three, and is known by its passing up behind the smaller sac to reach the oesophageal end of the stomach and course thence along the small curvature to anastomose with the pyloric branch of the hepatic artery. The splenic artery [449] is next to be followed along the upper border of the pancreas, and forwards on the left side of the smaller sac to reach the spleen; and in this course it will be seen to give off the great pancreatic and several small pancreatic branches, and, nearer its terminal distribution to the spleen, several vasa brevia to the stomach, and the left gastroepiploic which runs from left to right on the great curvature of the stomach. Lastly, the hepatic artery [448] will be observed passing forwards below the neck of the smaller sac and ascending in front of the M

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 121 the Meibomian glands [644] and subjacent tarsal plates [643], visible through it, is brought into view, and the deep surface of the inner part of the orbicularis muscle [fig. 272] can be dissected so as to display the fibres behind the tendo oculi and the extension over the lachrymal sac constituting the tensor tarsi [331]. The lachrymal sac [646] may be laid open and the entrance of the canaliculi into it exhibited; and a probe may be passed down to test the direction and width of the nasal duct; or the catheterisation of the duct from the nose may be practised according to the surgical rules; but on one side the duct should be left uninjured for future examination.1 15. Deep Dissections of Nerves and the Internal Ear.â€”The contents of the orbit having been removed, the foramen rotundum and infraorbital canal are to be carefully laid open with the bone-nippers, to ex- hibit the superior maxillary nerve and its branches. Opposite the spheno-maxillary fossa this nerve gives off the temporo-malar branch [544], which must be sought for near the anterior part of the outer wall of the orbit before that portion of the bone is removed; two sphenopalatine branches [544] to the ganglion of that name are next detached; immediately in front of these the two posterior dental branches will be found descending on the tuberosity of the upper jawbone, while in the fore part of the infraorbital canal is given off the anterior dented branch. For the purpose of examining the posterior dental branches the outer 1 When the dissection of the orbit has been completed the eyeball may be removed and preserved for examination, according to the directions given at page 133.

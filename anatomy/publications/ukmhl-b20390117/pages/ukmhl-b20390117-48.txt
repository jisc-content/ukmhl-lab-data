40 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. where it passes back between the oblique ligament and interosseous membrane; its branch, the inter- osseous recurrent, is to be followed up on the deep surface of the anconeus behind the external epicon- dyle of the humerus, and the main vessel is to be traced to its ramifications. Also, the termination of the anterior interosseous artery [441], after piercing the interosseous membrane, is to be seen on the back of the wrist. The radial artery [442, 443] is to be dissected out in the part of its course where it winds round under cover of the extensor tendons of the thumb to reach the interval between the heads of origin of the abductor indicis and pass forwards to end in the deep palmar arch. The branches given off by the radial artery in this part of its course are also to be sought out; namely, its first dorsal interosseous branch supplying branches to the second inter- osseous space, the posterior carpal branch, and the dorsal arteries of the thumb and index finger. The posterior carpal arch is formed by the anastomosis of the posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar arteries respectively, and from it the interosseous arteries of the third and fourth spaces spring; a dorsal branch for the inner side of the little finger is sup- plied by the posterior carpal of the ulnar [441]. The inferior perforating branches of the dorsal interosseous arteries and the dorsal collateral digital branches [443] should also be studied. The deep transverse ligament [287] binding the heads of the four inner metacarpal bones on their palmar aspect may now be dissected and divided, and the interossei muscles may be studied [284]; namely,

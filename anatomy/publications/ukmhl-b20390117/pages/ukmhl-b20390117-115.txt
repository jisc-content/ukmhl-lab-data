DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 105 artery [432], the subclavian must be pulled a little forward, as the origin of this branch is on its posterior aspect, where it begins to be crossed by the scalenus anticus: it enters immediately into the chest; but before doing so, it is usually the source of the deep cervical, which passes back below the trans- verse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. 10. The Face.â€”It is sometimes deemed desirable to devote one side of the face to the study of the muscles, and the other to the vessels and nerves. There is, however, no real difficulty in making a tolerably complete dissection of all the structures on both sides. To display the frontal region, a mesial incision may be made from the root of the nose to the vertex of the head. It will be convenient then to make another incision outwards from the middle line to the inner canthus of the eye, and carry it round by the margins of the eyelids. This will allow the very superficial orbicularis palpebrarum muscle [330] to be dissected out; together with the Undo palpebrarum or internal tarsal ligament, the position of which in relation to the nasal duct will be understood on comparing the dissection with a skull. The integument of the fore- head, as far back as the ear, may then be reflected. Near the middle line will be found the supratrochlear branch [541] of the ophthalmic nerve, and frontal branch [422] of the ophthalmic artery; and further outwards, ascending from the supraorbital notch, the supraorbital branch of the same nerve and the corre- sponding supraorbital branch of the ophthalmic artery. Beneath the supratrochlear and close to the inner angle

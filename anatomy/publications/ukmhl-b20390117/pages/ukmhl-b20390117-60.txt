DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 52 [293] are to be noted. Also the posterior surface of the adductor magnus muscle [295] should be thoroughly exhibited, and the various arteries which perforate it should be attended to, namely, the four perforating arteries of the profunda femoris [460], and the popliteal [461]. 3. The Front of the Thigh.—The subject having been turned, and the pelvis supported with blocks, the examination of the parts concerned in femoral hernia will be the first thing to occupy the dissector of the lower limb. An in- cision should be carried inwards along the fold of the groin from the anterior superior spine of the ilium; from the inner end of the first incision another should be carried downwards for about four inches; and from the lower end of this a third should be carried outwards transversely.1 The integument having been reflected outwards, the subcutaneous fat or superficial fascia is to be removed in like manner, care being taken not to pass so high as to interfere with the fascia of the groin to be dissected by the dissector of the abdomen. In doing this, the lym- phatic glands and all vessels and nerves are to be left undisturbed. The lymphatic glands will be seen to form two groups • the upper group oblique, receiv- ing lymphatics from the integuments of the abdo- men, the lower part of the back and the external genital organs ; the lower group vertical, receiving the superficial lymphatics of the limb [498]. The trunk 1 The upper of these three incisions may be omitted if the dissection be arranged in concert with that of the groin, made by the dissector of the abdomen.

DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 65 digitorum brevis is to be divided near its calcaneal end, and its branch of nerve from the internal plantar found. By the reflexion of the flexor brevis, the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus, dividing into four, will be brought into view; crossed by it and connected with it is the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus, and joining it from behind is the partly fleshy, partly tendinous musculus accessorius [317]; while connected with the tendons into which it divides are four small fleshy slips, the lumbricales muscles [317]. Crossing the musculus accessorius, and passing for- wards, are the external plantar artery [465] and nerve [534], the artery disappearing beneath the outer ten- don of the flexor digitorum longus, to be continued into the plantar arch, while the nerve, after giving off a branch to the musculus accessorius, and one to the abductor minimi digiti, which will be better seen by partially dividing the broad origin of that muscle from the calcaneum, sends its deep branch in along with the plantar arch and continues on to furnish digital branches to the outer side of the fifth toe and the adjacent sides of the fourth and fifth. From the outer of the digital branches a twig for the flexor minimi digiti brevis springs, and in addition, fre- quently at least, one for the interossei of the fourth space. The calcaneal origin of the abductor hallucis may now be divided, and the bifurcation of the pos- terior tibial artery and nerve into external and internal plantar will be seen, and the internal artery and nerve may be followed on from their origin. The internal plantar artery [466], much smaller than the external, will be traced toward the inner side of the great E

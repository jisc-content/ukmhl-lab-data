124 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. the antihelix divides above. The pointed inferior extremity of the helix, the absence of cartilage from the lobule, and the manner in which the cartilage is folded round so as to form the outer part of the external auditory canal, also the fissures of Santorini, are all to be exhibited. The wall of the cranium being now sawn down to the level of the petrous part of the temporal bone, the osseous part of the auditory canal is to be laid open with the nippers, care being taken not to injure the membrana tympani [673], the flaccid portion of which, in the notch of Rivini, should be specially attended to ; the course of the tensor tympani muscle is also to be followed backwards, and the tympanic cavity gently unroofed. With a little nicety, the deep part of the Glasserian fissure can also be opened, so as to expose in its continuity the chorda tympani [673], and show the attachment of the processus gracilis of the malleus. The action of the tensor tympani muscle can now be studied, and the arrange- ment of the malleus, incus, and stapes [671]; also the tendon of the stapedius muscle [672] will be seen passing forwards through the perforation of the pyramid to the neck of the stapes. The continuity of the middle ear with the Eustachian tube in front and the mastoid cells behind should be examined, and the mastoid process should be opened in order fully to exhibit the latter. When the tympanum has been studied, the general arrangement of the labyrinth [675] should be examined. A full view of this part can only be obtained in specimens specially prepared; but with a few judicious

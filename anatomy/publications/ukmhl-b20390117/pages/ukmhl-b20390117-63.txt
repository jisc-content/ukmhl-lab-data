DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 55 into two parts, and descends to the front and inner side of the knee. The internal cutaneous nerve [527], also from the anterior crural, having previously given one or two offsets which accompany the internal saphenous vein, is likewise divided into two branches before it pierces the fascia lata â€¢ the anterior branch appears some inches above the knee, on the inner side of the thigh, while the posterior is found lower down and descends to the inner side of the leg. In front of the last-mentioned nerve a branch of the internal saphenous nerve [528] pierces the sartorius and descends on the inner side of the knee. On the inner side of the thigh there is usually found a cutaneous twig from the superficial division of the obturator nerve [526]. On the surface of the patella is the synovial bursa, effusion into which is termed ' house- maid's knee.' The nerve twigs which ramify in front of and below the patella constitute the patellar plexus [529]. The aponeurosis is now to be removed from the front of the thigh, leaving, however, a strip called the ilio-tibial band, extending from the foremost two inches of the crest of the ilium to the outer side of the knee; and the structures exposed are to be freed from connective tissue. The sartorius muscle [297], crossing the thigh in its whole length from above downwards and inwards, is to be dis- sected out, and its nerve supply coming off from the cutaneous branches of the anterior crural nerve [527] is to be shown. The hollow between the upper border of the sartorius and the groin, sometimes named Scarpa's triangle, is next to be studied [294].

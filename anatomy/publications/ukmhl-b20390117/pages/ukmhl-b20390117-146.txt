136 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. which is a very delicate torn edge, the ligamentum pec- tinatum [653]. The iris in the ox differs from that of the human subject in having a horizontally elongated pupil, and in the circular muscular fibres round the pupil being much more distinctly separated from the radiating fibres at the circumference [653]. Sections should be made to show the passage of the sclerotic into the cornea, and the lamination of the cornea [647]. The laminae are considerably separated and evident to the naked eye when bichromate of potash is used. Turning now to the lens and fore part of the vitreous humour, there is seen a series of plications, zonule of Zinn [664], corresponding with the ciliary process; and if a blowpipe or nozzle of a syringe be introduced between these plications, close to the lens, and air or colouring matter introduced, a demonstra- tion will be had of the canal of Petit [664], bounded in front by the suspensory ligament. If a slight score be then made on the front of the lens, its capsule will be ruptured, the crystalline lens will fall out, and both lens and capsule may be fully examined [662, 663]. While one eyeball is examined in the easy way now described, on the other the tunics may be removed in series. For this purpose the first incision into the sclerotic should be made well forward where it is thinnest; and in carrying the cut made with the scissors round about, care must be taken not to injure the choroid; and the ciliary nerves [654] also may be preserved. A cut may then be made back to the optic nerve; the sclerotic may be everted; and then it may be cut away close to the optic nerve. The

DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 74 spreading out below to be attached to the scaphoid, calcaneum and astragalus, the external consisting of three distinct parts related one to another as the edges diverging from one angle of a cube, the anterior and posterior parts attached to the astragalus, and the middle part descending to the os calcis [195]. These lateral ligaments are to be cleaned and the rest of the wall of the joint removed; and the movements are then to be studied. The articulations of the astragalus with the calcaneum and scaphoid next demand attention; and the dorsal membrane uniting the head of the astragalus with the scaphoid may be removed, as also the synovial membrane between astragalus and calcaneum behind, so as to allow the movements to be properly seen; but the interosseous astragalo-calcaneal ligament can only be seen from the side at present, and cannot be laid bare till the bones are separated. The inferior and external calcaneo- scaphoid ligaments [196], which support the head of the astragalus, can, however, be studied now, and it will be seen how elasticity is secured to the inner arch of the foot by the weight of the body forcing down the head of the astragalus so as to make tense the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. The remaining ligaments of the dorsum and sole of the foot should be thoroughly cleaned. Numerous short dorsal bands will be found uniting the tarsal and metatarsal bones. On the under surface fibres will be seen prolonged from the tendon of the tibialis posticus to the three cuneiform bones, the cuboid, and the second, third and fourth metatarsal bones; also the ligamentum longum plantce, or long calcaneocuboid

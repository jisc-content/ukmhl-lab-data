150 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. The thoracic duct [497] is to be followed up, if this has not been already done; and, by an arrangement with the dissectors of the head and neck, it may be pursued round the apex of the left lung to its termination in the angle of junction of the left subclavian and left internal jugular vein. Then the lower part of the thoracic portion of the sympathetic chain, together with the three splanchnic nerves [564], should be traced to their passage through the diaphragm; and the diaphragm itself [367] may be examined, so far as it can be seen from the thorax. Lastly, the articulations of the ribs and dorsal vertebrae are to be dissected out [126]. Sometimes it will happen that the dissectors of the abdomen have by this time removed the pelvis and lower lumbar vertebrae, in which case all the vertebrae which remain can be examined by the thoracic dissectors; but if that be not the case, a division should be made about the level of the tenth dorsal vertebra; and in any circumstances, the first vertebra and costal arch should be left to the dissectors of the head and neck. In front of the vertebrae will then be seen part of the anterior common ligament [123] and the stellate or anterior costo-vertebral ligaments [126]. Behind, the laminae have probably been already removed, and the posterior common ligament [123] will be seen behind the bodies of the vertebrae. The posterior costo-trans- verse ligaments [126], passing from the tips of the transverse processes to the outer ridges of the tubercles of the ribs, require little dissection; and the long costo-transverse ligaments [126] will be seen on removal of the muscular fibres from the intervals

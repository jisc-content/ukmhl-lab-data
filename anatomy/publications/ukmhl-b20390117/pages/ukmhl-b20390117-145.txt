DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 135 spot, and the optic pore is further removed from the axis. In the ox eye a portion of the choroid presents a bright glistening appearance from the presence of a structure named tapetum [651], and opposite this the hexagonal epithelium is destitute of pigment; but in the human eye there is no tapetum. In the anterior half of the divided eyeball is seen the anterior margin of the retina, smooth in the ox, but dentated in the human subject and named or a serrata [657]. In the axis of the eye, through the vitreous humour, is seen the crystalline lens [662] with the aperture of the pupil in front of it, and outside of this the iris [653] and the radiating structures named ciliary processes [652]. The crystalline lens [662] and vitreous humour [661] may be allowed to drop away from their connections; or their separation may be assisted with the handle of the scalpel. The ciliary processes and back of the iris may then be washed so as to remove from them the dense pigment adhering to them; the sclerotic and cornea may be everted, and the connection of the tunica media (of which the choroid is the posterior and the iris the anterior portion) with the sclerotic may be examined. Between the sclerotic and choroid will be found the divided ciliary nerves [654] derived from the lenti- cular ganglion. Let the connection of the iris and choroid with the sclerotic be gently broken up with the handle of the scalpel, so as to detach them from the outer coat of the eye, and at the place of connec- tion there will be seen a white ring between choroid and iris, the ciliary muscle [652], and in front of this a canal opened into, the circular sinus [655], in front of

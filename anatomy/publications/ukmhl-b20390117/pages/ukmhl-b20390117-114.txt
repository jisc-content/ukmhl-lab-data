104 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. the subclavian and internal jugular veins is to be carefully dissected in search, on the left side, for the thoracic duct curving forwards and downwards to open at this point, and on the right side for the short and much smaller though corresponding structure, the right lymphatic duct [497]. In the dissection of the left side, arrangement ought to be made with the dissectors of the thorax to see the thoracic duct in its continuity. The vagus nerve [555] is to be followed down; and on the right side, after crossing the sub- clavian artery, it will be seen to give off its recurrent laryngeal branch [557]. On both sides the recurrent laryngeal nerve will be found passing up in the angle between the trachea and oesophagus. One or two branches of the sympathetic may pass in front of the right subclavian artery, and are to be preserved; but they can be better followed at a later stage. Three branches of the subclavian artery appear prominently, one directed downwards, namely, the internal mam- mary [431], and the other two upwards, namely, the vertebral [428] and the thyroid axis [430]. In dis- secting the vertebral artery, care must be taken not to injure the sympathetic nerve, the third cervical ganglion of which lies close beside it, sending branches round it [564]. The three branches of the thyroid axis, namely, the inferior thyroid, the transverse cervical, and the suprascapular, have already been seen in their distribution; their continuity will now be displayed; and the ascending cervical branch of the inferior thyroid artery [431] will be traced upwards in the line of contact of the scalenus anticus and the rectus capitis anticus major.

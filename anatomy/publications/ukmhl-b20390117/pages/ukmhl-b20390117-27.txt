DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 19 each with its ampulla, or dilatation, beneath the cutaneous areola, will be seen; and in young adults they may be traced onwards, and their orifices may be displayed by passing bristles through them. On subsequent removal of the fascia from the pectoralis major muscle beneath, the important connections of the mamma with it will be seen; and, lastly, a ver- tical incision should be made through the gland in such a manner as to bisect the nipple [799]. Beneath the subcutaneous fascia are the pectoralis major muscle [258] and the forepart of the deltoid [260], the pectoralis extending from the chest and inner end of the clavicle, and the deltoid from the outer part of the clavicle and from the shoulder, while between the two is the cephalic vein [485]. In removing the fascia from these muscles, the following cutaneous nerves may be preserved: the anterior cutaneous branches of the six upper intercostal nerves [523] emerging with corresponding branches of blood- vessels from the fore-part of the intercostal spaces, the descending cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus [512] crossing over the clavicle, and the anterior twigs of the lateral cutaneous branches of the third and the succeeding upper intercostal nerves [523], turning inwards over the axillary border of the great pectoral muscle. The lower part of the fibres of the yplatysma myoides [328], the cutaneous muscle of the neck, will also be seen crossing the clavicle. After the pectoralis major muscle has been thor- oughly exposed, its clavicular attachment should be divided, and the divided portion of the muscle should be reflected, care being taken of the cephalic vein as

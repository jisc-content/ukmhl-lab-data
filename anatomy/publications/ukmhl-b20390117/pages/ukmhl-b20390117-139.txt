DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 129 studied, the structure and extent of the tonsil itself should receive attention. The larynx and tongue are now to be separated from the parts above, and on the surface of the tongue [704] the three kinds ofpapillae, namely, filiform, fungi- form, and circumvallate, are to be studied, especially the Y-shaped arrangement of the circumvallate. The extrinsic muscles of the tongue already seen should be dissected up as far as possible, and the- intrinsic muscles [703] then examined. Between the genio- glossus and hyo-glossus will be found the longitudinal muscle, the inferior lingualis, and by removal of the mucous membrane of the dorsum, the superior lingualis. The vertical and transverse sets of muscular fibres, as well as the terminal arrangement of the fibres of the genio-glossus, are best exhibited by thin transverse sections held up against the light. The aperture of the glottis, the arrangement of the epiglottis, and, so far as can be seen without dissection, the vocal cords having been noted [742], the mucous membrane is to be removed from the back of the larynx, and the superior and inferior laryngeal nerves should be dissected out, so as to exhibit the muscular branches of the latter and the communications of the two nerves under cover of the thyroid cartilage [556, 557]. On the back of the cricoid cartilage will be seen the two posterior crico-arytenoid muscles [742]; above them, on the arytenoid cartilages, the trans- verse fibres of the arytenoideus; and, on its surface, the decussate oblique bands of the aryteno-epiglotticlei muscles [744]. On further removing the mucous membrane the cornicida laryngis (cartilages of San- I

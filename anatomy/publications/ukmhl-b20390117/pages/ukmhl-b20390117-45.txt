DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 37 metacarpal bone along its length; while, on the inner side of the thumb, the adductor pollicis is sufficiently distinct as it comes from the third metacarpal bone. The remaining mass of muscle arising by two heads and likewise inserted into the first phalanx of the thumb by two insertions, an outer and inner, consti- tutes the flexor brevis. The abductor minimi digiti and flexor minimi digiti brevis are separated by the deep branch of the ulnar artery, and the opponens minimi digiti is distinguished by being inserted into the length of the metacarpal bone. These muscles having been seen, the deep branches of the ulnar artery [441] and nerve [520] are to be followed, and the artery will be a guide to the deep palmar arch from the radial [445], which it completes. The recurrent, superior perforating and palmar interosseous branches of the deep palmar arch are to be dissected, as also the princeps pollicis and radial branch of the index finger given off from the radial artery as it enters the hand [442-43]. 9. The Back of the Forearm and Hand.â€”The remaining integuments being removed, the super- ficial veins and the distribution of the radial [522] and ulnar [519] nerves on the back of the hand will be followed out. The arrangement of the nerves is subject to some variation : as a rule, the radial sup- plies both sides of the thumb as far as the base of the nail, and both sides of the index and middle fingers and the outer side of the ring finger as far as the extremity of the first phalanx in each case, while the ulnar is distributed to the inner side of the ring finger and both sides of the little finger as far as the

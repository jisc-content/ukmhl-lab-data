78 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, but this nerve is not to be followed at the present stage of the dis- section. Passing backwards across the space between the sterno-mastoid and the trapezius are the spinal accessory nerve [558], and lower down some branches of the cervical plexus destined for the supply of the latter muscle [513]. The cervical part of the trapezius should be divided by means of a vertical incision made in co-operation with the dissector of the upper limb; and along with him the spinal accessory nerve and superficial cervical artery [431] descending on the deep surface of the trapezius should be dissected out. Along with the spinal acces- sory the branches from the cervical plexus already mentioned are to be followed. The different nerves are often freely connected with one another beneath the muscle. The splenius muscle [358], which can be distinguished from the portion of the erector spinae along its lower border by its fibres passing from spines to transverse processes, is next to be cleaned, and afterwards divided vertically about an inch from the middle line, and its attachments dissected up to their bony connections, so as to distinguish the splenius capitis and splenius colli, and bring into view the stout muscle on which it lies, namely, the complexus [360], as also the thin strip of fibres, the trachelo-mastoid muscle, ascending between the splenius and the outer part of the complexus muscle. Also the occipital artery [417] close to the skull is to be cleared in the part of its course beneath the trachelo-mastoid and splenius muscles, and its descending cervical branch is to be followed downwards.

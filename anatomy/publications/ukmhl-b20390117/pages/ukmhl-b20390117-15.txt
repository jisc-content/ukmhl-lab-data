THE USE OF INSTRUMENTS. 7 it is most important that the student should learn in the dissecting-room to handle dexterously, since in surgery they are indispensable. Before using the saw, the bone should be laid perfectly bare by division of the periosteum. A preliminary stroke backwards at the part to be divided should be made to help the saw to catch sufficiently, and the suc- ceeding sweeps should be long and light. On no account can a lateral movement be allowed for com- pleting the division; as such an action, however natural when a difficulty is experienced, is not only destructive to the instrument, but liable to leave a jagged fracture of the bone. In the use of bone- nippers, also, all wriggling or lateral movement must be avoided. The bone to be divided should be firmly grasped, and the section made entirely by pressing the handles together. The flat side of the blades should be always turned towards the portion of bone to be preserved, as on that side only can it be secured, by proper use of the instrument, that the bone shall exhibit a direct cut unbroken by splintering. Bone-nippers are often made too long in the blade. It ought to be remembered that the shorter the blades, the greater the leverage. They ought to become narrower gently from the base to the point.

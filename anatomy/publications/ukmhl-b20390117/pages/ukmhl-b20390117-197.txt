DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 187 bearing in mind that he has already seen a con- tinuation of the same aponeurosis superficial to the erector spinse, he will understand the disposition referred to when the posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis is said to be continued into three layers. The quadratus lumborum [379] is next to be dissected, showing its attachments to the last rib, iliac crest and ilio-lurnbar ligament, and the fibres ascending and descending from the transverse processes. 9. The Pelvis.â€”The pelvis is to be separated from the upper part of the trunk by sawing through the vertebral column about the level of the second or third lumbar vertebra. All unseemly portions of integument and muscle on the outside of the pre- paration, left by the dissectors of other parts, are to be removed; and if one or both hip-joints have been left undissected by the dissectors of the lower limbs, their capsules [187] are now to be freed from their surroundings, and the psoas magnus and iliacus muscles are to be followed to their insertion [301, 302]. Poupart's ligament may be detached from the ilium, and any points not hitherto exhibited in its disposition are to be examined before clearing away the remains of the abdominal muscles; also the deep circumflex iliac artery [457] is to be followed up and its anas- tomosis with the ilio-lumbar artery [455] seen. Likewise the obturator membrane [186] should be cleared on the outside, and the branches of the obturator artery [453] on its surface exhibited. The Perinceum in the Female ought at this time to be dissected. The integuments are to be reflected

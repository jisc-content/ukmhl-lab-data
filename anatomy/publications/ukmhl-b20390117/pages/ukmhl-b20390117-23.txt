DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 15 require division. Then the longissimus dorsi, con- stituting the main part of the inner column of the erector spinas, is to have its insertions, as far as possible, individually dissected out, so as to show that they consist of an outer series of muscular slips attached to ribs and lumbar transverse processes, and an inner series, more tendinous, attached to dorsal transverse and lumbar accessory processes. At the upper part, this muscle will be found pro- longed into the neck by the transversalis colli, sl muscle connected by both origins and insertions with transverse processes, and lying close to the border of the splenius; while the transversalis colli is in turn prolonged to the skull by the trachelo- mastoid muscle already mentioned. The complexus muscle is to be divided close to its insertion, if this has not already been done by the dissector of the head and neck. The semispinalis muscle [361], separable into semispinalis dorsi and sewispinalis colli, will then be seen with fibres directed upwards and inwards over several vertebras, extending from transverse processes as low as the tenth dorsal up to the spine of the axis. Below the lower margin of the semispinalis, which is marked by flat tendons, part of the multifidus spince [361] is visible, a muscle whose fibres likewise pass upwards and inwards, but are much shorter than those of the semispinalis, while the muscle as a whole is greatly longer. To show the lower part of the multifidus spinas, the aponeurotic origins of the longissimus dorsi from the lumbar spines and sacrum must be divided, which will likewise permit a more complete

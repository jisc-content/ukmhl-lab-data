DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 95 right and left portions of the cerebrum should be separated by an incision in the middle line; the parts displayed in section should be studied, and one of the anterior crura of the fornix should be followed down to the corresponding corpus albicans, and its fibres traced as they twist within that structure and turn upwards into the optic thalamus [618]. A series of transverse vertical sections may now be made. Such a section passing through the caudate nucleus of the corpus striatum and the island of Eeil will show between them the lenticular nucleus [614] extending upwards and outwards from the anterior perforated spot, with the white matter of the internal capsule between it and the caudate nucleus, while the external capsule between it and the insula is divided by the thin grey line of the claustrum. Sections further back will show the tail of the nucleus caudatus outside the grey matter of the optic thalamus; and another close to the back of the corpora quadrigemina will show the pigmented locus cceruleus [613], Divide on each side the restiform body and the pons Varolii where they are about to enter the cere- bellum, forming the inferior and middle crura. The fourth ventricle will thus be laid open; the groove called calamus scriptorius [596] will be seen on its floor, continued up from the opening of the central canal of the spinal cord. Fibres of the auditory nerve will be seen extending to the middle line, and lower down the delicate flap called the ligula; also internal to the restiform bodies are the posterior pyramids, whose fibres may be traced beneath the grey matter of the

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 103 glossal nerve, is to be traced upwards, and the posterior auricular can be followed to its distribution, 9. Deep Dissection of the Root of the Neck.—The sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle is to be divided, and its attachments are to be thoroughly dissected out [351]. On a day arranged to suit the convenience of both tho dissector of the neck and the dissector of the arm, the clavicle is to be divided by the latter, or removed at the sterno-clavicular articulation, if it has been so agreed on, when a view will be obtained of the passage of the brachial plexus from the neck into the axilla [514]. From the brachial plexus will be seen given off the following branches above the clavicle [515, 516], besides the communicating branch to the phrenic, and the nerve to the subclavius muscle already preserved :—from the back of the cord formed by union of the anterior divisions of the fifth and sixth spinal nerves, the suprascapular nerve; from the same two trunks before they join, and from the seventh, the posterior thoracic nerve (external respiratory nerve of Bell), destined for the serratus magnus muscle; and from the back part of the fifth, the branch for the rhomboid muscles. The first part of the subclavian artery, internal to the scalenus anticus muscle, now demands attention; and the arrangement of this, as well as that of the lower part of the common carotid artery, and their relations to the veins in front of them, are to be com- pared on the right and left sides of the body [413,427]. The junction of the internal jugular and the subclavian vein to form the right or left innominate vein will be seen [469-471]; and the angle of junction between

DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 43 behind may be made to display the movements of the radius on the first row of carpal bones, the move- ments of one row on the other, and of the bones of each row one on another; and until these exam- inations have been made and the movability of the metacarpal bones at their carpal ends has been studied [161], the lateral ligaments, the oblique-fibres of the dorsal ligaments uniting the upper row of carpal bones with the radius and with the second row, and the pennately arranged anterior ligaments should be left intact. The articulation of the thumb with the trapezium should next be examined [159], and the articulations of the metacarpal bones with the phalanges, and of the phalanges one with another. In the metacarpo-phalangeal articulations of the four inner digits, when the student has dissected out the anterior ligament, he will find that its fibres arch across and act as a sling for the head of the meta- carpal bone, preventing over-extension ; and on bend- ing the joints he will find that the lateral ligaments are put on the stretch by their metacarpal attach- ments being situated far back, and that thus it happens that the fingers have only one position in flexion, while in extension, the looseness of the lateral ligaments permits separation and approximation. The carpal joints should be thoroughly laid open to show the interosseous ligaments between the carpal bones and between the carpal ends of the metacarpal bones, and to bring into view the extent of the synovial cavities [158-160].

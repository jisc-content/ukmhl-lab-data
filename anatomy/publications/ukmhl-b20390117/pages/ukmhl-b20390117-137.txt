DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 127 16. Pharynx, Larynx, Tongue and Nares.â€”The main trunks of the blood-vessels having been re- moved, the trachea and oesophagus are to be divided at the root of the neck, and the pharynx is to be raised from the prevertebral muscles and followed up to the base of the skull. An occipital ligament of the pharynx [210] will be seen running back to the tubercle on the basilar process of the occipital bone, and is to be severed. By means of the chisel and mallet the skull is to be divided so as to separate the part to which the pharynx is attached from the hinder part; and if on one side the petrous part of the temporal bone still remains, the section should be made to pass behind it. The pharynx should now be distended with tow. The glossopharyngeal nerve [554], the pharyngeal branch of the vagus [556], and the superior and re- current laryngeal nerves [557], together with the superior [415] and inferior laryngeal [430] and ascending pharyngeal [415] arteries and the palatal and tonsillar branches of the facial [416], should be followed as far as practicable, and the superior, middle, and inferior constrictor muscles [345, 346] of the pharynx, with the longitudinal and circular fibres of the oesophagus [709], should be displayed. In connection with the superior constrictor the part of the pharynx above its superior border is to be noted, and also the pterygo- maxillary ligament [356] separating this muscle from the buccinator. The middle constrictor will be seen to overlap the upper, and to be in turn overlapped by the inferior. The relations of the upper border of the superior constrictor to the levator and tensor palati

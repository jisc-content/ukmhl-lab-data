DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 161 with the sheath formed by the lumbar fascia for the erector spina?. The sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle [380] may now be opened by means of an incision in its whole length, about an inch from the middle line. The muscle [380] adheres to the anterior wall of its sheath at three or four places where it is crossed by tendinous intersections, and those adhesions must be divided without injury to the muscle. The anterior wall of the sheath can then be turned outwards and inwards, the structure of the linea alba separating the sheaths of opposite sides can be examined, and the muscle may be raised from the posterior wall of the sheath. In the lower part of the sheath, ascending from the pubes to the linea alba, is the pyramidalis muscle [380], in front of the rectus. The series of lower thoracic nerves will be seen piercing the rectus muscle; and underneath it, entering the sheath from the outside, in the lower part, is the deep epigastric artery [456], which ought to be traced in its course up through the muscle; while the superior epigastric [432], coming from the internal mammary, may be traced in the muscle from above downwards, and in many instances its anastomosis with the deep epigastric will be easily exhibited. The structure of the sheath of the rectus muscle is to be examined by raising the dissected portions of the oblique muscles, and observing the splitting of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique, and the union of its divisions with the aponeuroses of the external oblique and transversalis muscles in front of and behind the rectus. Also in the lower part of its extent is to be noted the extreme weak- L

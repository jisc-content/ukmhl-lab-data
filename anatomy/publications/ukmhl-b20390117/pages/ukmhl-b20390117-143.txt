DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 133 the movements permitted between the cervical verte- brae examined: also the upper end of the anterior common ligament will be seen. The laminas are then to be cut across, if this has not been previously done for the examination of the spinal cord; and it will be noticed that the ligamenta subflava [123] between the lower vertebras are replaced between the occipital bone, atlas and axis by white fibrous tissue [125]. Within the spinal canal the upper part of the posterior common ligament [123] is seen, and connected with it the flat band from the body of the axis to the occipital bone. When this has been reflected, the transverse ligament [124] of the atlas, with the upper and lower appendages which give it a cruciate form, will be seen ; and also the lateral odontoid or check ligaments passing outwards to the occipital bone from the odontoid process of the axis, and between them the delicate middle odontoid ligament [125]. The character of the movements of the articular surfaces of the atlas, axis and occipital bone is then to be noticed, as well as the bursa behind and in front of the odontoid process; • and the movements permitted by the articulations of the six lower cervical vertebras should also be studied [127]. If the parts be in a state of particularly good preservation, a vertical transverse section may be made through some of the vertebras to exhibit the joints of Luschka at the sides of the intervertebral discs [123]. 18. The Eyeball.—This organ should now be dis- sected, and as the dissection cannot be made com- pletely on one eyeball, a pair of ox eyes may with advantage be employed, and the earliest opportunity

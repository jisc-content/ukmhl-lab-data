108 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. facial artery and vein is to be traced from their appearance on the face in front of the masseter muscle to their termination in the angular artery and vein internal to the orbit [416]; and the lateral nasal branch of the artery will also be seen. Two deeper muscles and a nerve are now to be displayed, to a certain extent under cover of the levator proprius labii superioris. The nerve, the infraorbital [543], emerges from the canal of the same name; it is the terminal part of the second division of the fifth nerve, and sends large branches to the upper lip. The muscles arise from the canine fossa, and are the levator anguli oris [333] directed downwards and outwards, and the compressor naris [332] widening as it extends inwards on the nose. The buccinator [333], the flat muscle which supports the mucous membrane of the mouth between the upper and lower jaws, is now to be cleaned so far as it is yet laid bare; and the pad of fat between its back part and the masseter muscle is to be taken away; and coming forward on the buccinator there will be found the buccal branch [419] of the internal maxillary artery and the buccal nerve [546] from the inferior maxillary trunk. Below the mouth the depressor anguli oris, [333] will be seen extending upwards to the angle ; and internal to it, slightly concealed by it, the fibres of the flat depressor labii inferioris pass upwards and inwards, extending to the middle line. The remaining muscle of this region, the levator menti, can be seen to most advantage by first everting the lower lip and remov- ing the mucous membrane from the upper border of the levatores menti of both sides where they arise

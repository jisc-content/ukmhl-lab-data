THE OKDEE OF DISSECTION. The dissection of the body may be conveniently divided into five parts. These areâ€”the upper limb, the lower limb, the head and neck, the thorax, and the abdomen. Two dissectors may be set to work on each of the last three parts; while, in the case of the limbs, either one or two dissectors may be appointed to each, as may be necessary. If the subject be a male, at least one day should be devoted to the dis- section of the perinseum before the other dissections are commenced, as the surgical anatomy of that region cannot be well appreciated after dissection of the lower limbs, nor in other position than that for perineal lithotomy. After the dissection of the perinseum in the case of a male, or immediately on being brought into the rooms in the case of a female, the subject should be laid on its face, for the dissection of the hinder part of the scalp and neck, the muscles and other struc- tures of the back, the spinal cord, the buttock, the back of the thigh and the popliteal space. These dis- sections may usually be completed in four days, after which the subject may be turned. The upper limbs

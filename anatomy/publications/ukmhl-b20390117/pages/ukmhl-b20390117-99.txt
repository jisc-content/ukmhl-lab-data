DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 89 will be found to be continuous behind with the parietal and occipital lobes, the superior one passing in to the pre-angular or supra-marginal, and the middle into the angular gyrus, while the inferior reaches back to the lowest occipital gyrus. The fissure of Rolando, ex- tending downwards and slightly forwards from the vertex to a spot a little behind the place where the fissure of Sylvius divides into its two limbs, may always be readily distinguished by its position be- tween two elongated convolutions crossing the outer surface of the hemisphere. The convolution in front of it, the ascending frontal of some authors, but more properly named anterior Bolandic, lies between the Eolandic fissure and three others which run forwards and are named the superior, middle and inferior frontal convolutions. These three are so arranged that on the orbital lobe or under surface, the superior is con- tinuous with the inner, the inferior with the posterior, and the middle with the anterior convolution bounding the triradiate sulcus. Behind the fissure of Rolando the posterior Bolandic convolution is placed, and has, extending back from it superiorly as far as the top of the parieto-occipital fissure, where the latter indents the margin of the hemisphere, the superior parietal convolution; and beneath this two other convolutions are distinguished, namely, the angular, abutting against the superior occipital behind, and the pre-angular (sometimes called supra-margined) in front of it. The mesial surface of the hemisphere should now be examined (fig. 449). Passing from the front backwards along the edge of the hemisphere is the marginal convolution, and

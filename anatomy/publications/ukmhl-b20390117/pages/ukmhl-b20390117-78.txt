68 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 6. The Front of the Leg and Dorsum of the Foot. â€”A block may be placed under the knee, and on removing the remaining integument and the sub- cutaneous fat, there will be found, above, the distribution of cutaneous branches of the external popliteal nerve [535], and in the lower part of the leg the trunk of the musculo-cutaneous nerve piercing the fascia lata. On the dorsum the arch of vein from which the external and internal saphenous take origin will be seen; the external saphenous nerve [533] will be traced principally to the outer side of the little toe, the internal saphenous nerve [528] to the inner side of the foot, and the musculo- cutaneous [535] nerve to the inner side of the great toe and the adjacent sides of the second and third, third and fourth, and fourth and fifth toes; while the anterior tibial [536] nerve will be found becoming cutaneous between the first and second metatarsal bones, and supplying digital branches to the adjacent sides of the first and second toes. Occasionally the area of supply of the musculo-cutaneous nerve is diminished at the outer side of the foot, while that of the external saphenous is correspondingly in- creased. The aponeurosis is now to be removed, with the exception of the bands constituting the anterior an- nular ligament [326]. Of these, the most important forms a strong loop round the extensor digitorum longus and peroneus tertius muscles, and is attached to the fore part of the calcaneum in the hollow between it and the astragalus; two somewhat irregular bands continue inwards from this loop,

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. Ill attachments. The surface of the temporal muscle is then to be examined [342]. The handle of the scalpel is to be passed in closely beneath the attach- ment of the temporal muscle to the coronoid process, so as to make sure of separating from its deep surface the buccal branch of nerve â€¢ and by means of two cuts with the bone-nippers, one directed downwards from the sigmoid notch, and the other backwards from the lower part of the anterior border of the ramus, the coronoid process and fore part of the ramus are to be detached. The temporal muscle can then be reflected upwards, and what is known as the pterygoid space will be brought into view, and may be further exposed by clipping away all but the posterior border of the ramus of the jaw. On cleaning away the adipose tissue, the external pterygoid, muscle [343] will be found occupying the zygomatic fossa and directed back to the neck of the jaw; and on its surface the internal maxillary artery [418] lies in its course from the parotid region where it has been seen arising, till it dips between the heads of the external pterygoid muscle into the pterygo-maxillary fossa.1 As it comes forward below the ramus of the jaw the artery gives off the middle meningeal branch upwards and the inferior dental in a downward direction, and rests on a strong membrane descending from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone to the sharp edge of the opening of the inferior dental canal, namely, the structure known as the 1 While this is the more common arrangement, it is to be noted, however, that in many cases the artery passes along the deep surface of the muscle.

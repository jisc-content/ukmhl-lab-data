DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 151 between successive transverse processes. The move- ments permissible at the heads and tubercles of the ribs, as well as between the vertebrae, may then be examined, so far as the imperfect character of the specimen allows; and the vertebrae may then be separated to show the ligamentum colli costce [126] between each rib and its corresponding transverse process, and also the interior of the costo-vertebral joint, with its inter articular ligament. To exhibit fully, however, the movements of the vertebrae and ribs requires a thorax and vertebral column to be devoted to the purpose ; and even then it is to be remembered that the respiratory movements cannot be imitated after death [129].

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 93 be reflected forwards, so as to exhibit the appearance on its under surface named psalterium or lyra [617], caused by transverse fibres properly belonging to the corpus callosum being bounded on each side by a longi- tudinal half of the fornix. The dipping down of the anterior crura of the fornix should also be noted [618]. The reflection of pia mater, called velum interposition [619], of which the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles are the vascular edges, is now exposed, with the veins of Galen [356] running down the middle \ and, on the side of which the descending cornu has been dissected, the posterior lobe of the hemisphere may be lifted up and the transverse fissure [619] of the brain, by which the velum interpositum and choroid plexus enter from without, may be laid open to the bottom of the cornu. By this means the posterior part of the gyrus fornicatus, namely, the gyrus hip- pocampi, will be brought into view, with the sulcus hippocampi between it and the fimbria, and, at the bottom of the sulcus, the gyrus dentatus, which is simply the free edge of the grey matter of the hemi- sphere, indented by the entrance of small arteries. The choroid plexus is to be divided on each side at the entrance into the descending cornu; the pia mater behind the velum interpositum is to be raised from the corpora quaclrigemina [608], which it covers, and as it is reflected forwards, care is to be taken to separate from it, without injury, a body about the size of a small pea, the pineal body [610], which is attached delicately in front of the corpora quadri- gemina; the velum interpositum can then be raised completely, so as to display the third ventricle beneath,

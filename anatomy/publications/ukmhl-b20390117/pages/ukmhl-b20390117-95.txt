DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 85 the encephalon [593]. He will notice that the medulla oblongata, the expanded continuation upwards of the spinal cord, is terminated above by a transverse struc- ture, the pons Varolii, that the pons is continued on each side into a grey laminated structure, the cere- bellum, which forms much the larger bulk of the part which was removed from beneath the tentorium; and that above the pons Varolii a pair of divergent pillars, the crura cerebri, pass upward to disappear under cover of the cerebral hemispheres. He will further note, in a general way, the projection of each hemi- sphere into anterior, middle, and posterior lobes, and the separation of the two first by the fissure of Sylvius; also the existence of a rhomboid space between the two middle lobes, bounded behind by the crura cerebri, and in front by the optic commissure, from which the optic nerves take origin and the optic tracts diverge in a backward direction. The arrangement of the arachnoid membrane or serous envelope of the brain, and of the pia mater or vascular covering may now be examined [579]. The region between these two membranes constitutes the subarachnoid space, and demands particular attention, not only over the sulci of the cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres, but over the rhomboid space, the fissure of Sylvius, and round the isthmus cerebri, or narrow part between the cerebrum and cerebellum; also over the interval between the cerebellum and medulla oblongata, called the opening into the fourth ventricle. The arteries to be studied on the surface of the brain are the following. Behind are the vertebral arteries on the medulla oblongata, giving off the

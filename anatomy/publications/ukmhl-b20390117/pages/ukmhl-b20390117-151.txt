141 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. be dissected out. together with the branches joining them, viz., the inferior thyroids [470], internal mam- maries, and left superior intercostal [479]; and also, joining the vena cava superior above the root of the right lung, the great vena azygos [479]. The transverse part of the aorta [411] is now also seen, with the innominate [412], left common carotid [413], and left subclavian [427] arteries coming off from it; and on lifting up and turning aside the left lung, the con- tinuation of the arch into the descending aorta can be observed. Crossing the arch of the aorta between the origins of the left common carotid and left subclavian artery is the left pneumogastric nerve [556], and internal to it the cardiac branch given off by the left pneumogastric [557] in the lower part of the neck, and sometimes that from the first cervical ganglion [563]. The origin of the recurrent laryngeal branch of the left pneumogastric turning round the arch of the aorta is to be dissected out [557], as also the cardiac branches given off from the recurrent laryngeal [557]; and immediately internal to this nerve will be found a tough fibrous structure con- nected with the concavity of the aortic arch, which is the ductus arteriosus [410]. The main trunk of the left pneumogastric nerve is to be followed downwards, and its branches to the front of the root of the left lung (anterior pulmonary plexus) are to be traced [557]; and the lung is then to be thrown forward and kept in that position with a string if necessary, while the course of the pneumo- gastric is dissected further, and the branches going to the back of the root of the lung, together with the

116 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. of the falx cerebri with the tentorium. In the falx cerebelli will be found the occipital sinus, also leading into the torcular Herophili. The lateral sinuses are to be laid open in their whole course down to the jugular foramen. In the posterior part of that fora- men the commencement of the jugular vein is to be seen, while in front of it are the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric and spinal accessory nerves, the two latter separated from the former by a partition of dura mater; still more anteriorly the inferior petrosal sinus passes through the foramen to fall into the jugular vein. Along the free border of the petrous bone the superior petrosal sinus is to be laid open \ and, between the two inferior petrosal sinuses, across the basilar process of the occipital bone, is the trans- verse sinus. An incision is now to be carried from a position immediately outside the point of exit of the third nerve, backwards and then outwards, to that of the fifth, and is to be prolonged a little way forward and outward, and on raising the flap of dura mater so made, the cavernous sinus will be brought into view; and by incisions round the opening where the infundibulum descended to the pituitary body, the circular sinus uniting the two cavernous sinuses will be laid open. The positions, in the wall of the cavernous sinus, of the third and fourth nerves, and the ophthalmic division of the fifth, lying in that order from within outwards and downwards, are to be brought into view, and the sixth nerve in the floor of the sinus, and the internal carotid artery [420], as it passes through the sinus, are to be observed. The dura mater should then be dissected from the other

96 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. floor towards the cerebrum. The various lobes and laminae of the cerebellum may now be studied [603, 604]; but it is only necessary here to mention the amygdala placed on each side of the vallecula, behind the flocculus, and, in the vallecula, the inferior vermi- form process, divided from behind forwards into parts named the pyramid, the uvula, and the nodule or laminated tubercle. If care be taken in removing the membranes it will be seen that the hollow of the fourth ventricle is prolonged laterally along the whole length of the peduncle of the flocculus. At each side of the laminated tubercle is a thin layer of cerebral substance, the posterior velum, bounding the vestige of the original cavity of the cerebellum seen in the foetus and lower kinds of vertebrata. The cerebellum should now be divided by mesial section; and another vertical incision should be made backwards and out- wards, so as to exhibit the corrugated grey centre called corpus dentatum [605], found in each lateral half. A similarly shaped centre, the olivary nucleus [598], is seen on transverse section through the olivary body of the medulla oblongata. 6. Superficial Dissection of the Neck.â€”It is neces- sary that the surgically important region in which the third part of the subclavian artery lies should be studied before the removal of the arm; and it is well that in conjunction with the dissector of the arm an examination should be made of the structures passing into it from the neck. The space between the sterno-mastoid and trapezius muscles known as the posterior triangle should therefore be dissected during the first few days after the subject has been laid on

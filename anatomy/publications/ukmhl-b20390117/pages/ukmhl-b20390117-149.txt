DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 139 both sides whose cartilages have been divided may be removed, together with the subjacent pleura, back as far as can be conveniently reached in the position of the body, the sternum meanwhile remaining intact. The anterior border of each pleural sac can now be observed, the right lying close to the middle line below, or crossing it, and the left receding from the middle line, also the extent of the interval between the borders of the two sacs, which is known as the anterior mediastinum [686], and is in its lower part widened out and inclined to the left. The lungs should also be inflated from the windpipe, so as to give an idea of the extent to which they descend between the ribs and diaphragm in inspiration. After this, the sternum is to be sawn across through the manubrium and removed, and on the side on which the cartilages are left a view will be obtained of the triangularis sterni muscle and internal mammary artery from the deep aspect; and also the articulations of the costal cartilages and sternum may be examined. Two or three more of the ribs may be taken out of the way by separating them from their costal car- tilages, and nipping them across in a line with those above them. 2. The Pleura and Parts adjacent.â€”The lungs are to be raised, and any fluid or other impurities sponged away from the pleural cavities. If the parietal and pulmonary layers of the pleura be anywhere adherent, the adhesions are to be broken down with the fingers; and it is important to observe that, excepting only the reflections of the pleural membrane and the lung itself, no part of the dissection need be seriously

45 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. [526], the main trunk of which, however, does not encroach on the gluteal region. Turning upwards round the inferior border of the gluteus maximus muscle are some branches of the small sciatic nerve [531], which may be sought for by cutting clown on the lower border of the muscle, or may be more conveniently found when the subcutaneous fat and fascia have been reflected as far as that border. Piercing the gluteus maximus, close to its origin, are some small branches from the posterior divisions of the upper sacral nerves [511], and turning over the lower border near its inner edge the perforating cutaneous branch of the anterior division of the fourth sacral nerve [536]: these are to be preserved in order that their deep relations may be dissected out. The adipose tissue is now to be removed, so as to lay bare the strong fascia lata (aponeurosis of the lower limb) covering the anterior part of the gluteus medius muscle, between the crest of the ilium and the upper border of the gluteus maximus; and when that border, extending from the back part of the ilium to a point a little above the great trochanter, is reached, it will be observed that the fascia splits into a deep and a superficial part, so as to invest the muscle. This circumstance having been noted, it will be unnecessary, except for demonstration of the fascia, to leave the layer covering the gluteus maximus; and the muscular fibres may be at once cut down on, and the surface of the muscle displayed. The inferior border of the gluteus maximus is to be thoroughly dissected out in its whole extent as far as its insertion into the femur, and the synovial bursa usually present

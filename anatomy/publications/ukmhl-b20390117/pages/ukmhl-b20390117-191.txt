DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 181 The liver [731], separated from the other viscera removed with it, is to be laid with its under surface uppermost. There will then be seen the division into right and left lobes by the longitudinal fissure, the portal fissure at right angles to this, and in front of the right extremity of the portal fissure the fissure containing the gall bladder, and in the posterior border that containing the inferior vena cava; also in front of the portal fissure the quadrate lobe, behind it the lobulus Spigelii, and to the right of the lobulus Spigelii the eminence called lobulus caudatus. In the longi- tudinal fissure the obliterated umbilical vein is to be traced backwards; and at the portal fissure it will be found connected with the left portal vein, while behind that fissure it is continued into a fibrous band, the obliterated ductus venosus, leading back to the inferior vena cava [731, 483, 495], The disposi- tion of arteries, veins and ducts in the portal fissure is to be dissected out; sections are to be made through the organ, so as to show its appearance and the difference between the sections of branches of the hepatic veins kept open by the firm adhesion of their walls to the hepatic tissue, and the sections of the portal veins, hepatic arteries and ducts running together and surrounded by a loose fibrous sheath, the capsule of Glisson [734]. Also the gall-bladder is to be opened and washed, so as to show its peculiar finely honey-combed mucous membrane. 7.

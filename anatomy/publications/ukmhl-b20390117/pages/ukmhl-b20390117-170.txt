160 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. costal attachments in such a manner as to separate them from the rest of the muscle; and each costal slip of attachment, as well as the insertion into the crest of the ilium, is to be dissected out and reflected. An incision is then to be directed inwards from the anterior superior spine of the ilium, across the fibres of the aponeurosis, to the sheath of the rectus muscle; the remainder of the muscle above the incision is to be reflected inwards as far as it can be raised, and the obliquus mternus muscle [377] is to be cleaned. Posteriorly the latter has its fibres directed upwards and forwards; and in most cases a small angular part behind is left uncovered by the external oblique. The internal oblique muscle is to be dealt with in a manner similar to the external oblique; that is to say, it is to be divided near its attachments to the cartilages of the lower ribs so as to liberate both them and the insertion into the crest of the ilium, and an incision is to be carried inwards from the ilium in front, leaving the lower part of the muscle undissected in the meantime; and the upper part is to be reflected inwards to the sheath of the rectus, so as to lay bare the transversalis muscle. Between the internal oblique and the transversalis the trunks of the lower thoracic nerves and the ilio-hypogastric will be found, and are to be preserved. The transversalis abdominis muscle [378] cannot be seen in its entirety at present; but the parallel disposition of its fibres can be seen, also its origin from the crest of the ilium, and the connection of its anterior aponeurosis with the sheath of the rectus muscle, and of its posterior aponeurosis

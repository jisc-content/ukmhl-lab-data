66 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. toe; the internal plantar nerve [534], larger than the external, supplies the flexor digitorum brevis and the abductor hallucis, and then divides into four digital nerves supplying respectively the inner side of the great toe and the adjacent sides of the first and second, second and third, and third and fourth toes; and from, the first of these branches the nerve to the flexor hallucis brevis will be found coming off, and from the second and third the nerves to the two inner lumbricales.1 At this stage of the dissection the tendinous sheaths on the toes should be dissected out and divided; and the arrangement of the tendons within them, which is similar to that of the fingers [272, 273], should be examined; but the dissection of the insertions of the lumbricales must be left till a later period. The posterior tibial nerve and the tendons of the long flexors must now be divided below the ankle and reflected, and the short muscles of the great and little toes [321], together with the plantar arch or ter- minal part of the external plantar artery [465] and the deep branch of the external plantar nerve [534], are to be dissected out. In reflecting the tendons, care is to be taken not to injure the nerves to the two or three outer lumbricales coming from the branch named. The other twigs from the same branch are distributed to the adductor hallucis, the transversus pedis and the interossei; the two inter- ossei of the fourth space may, however, receive their twigs from the outer digital branch of the external 1 The second lumbricalis frequently receives its supply from the external plantar nerve.

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 123 behind, and at the upper part of that branch on the deep side of the parent trunk will be found the otic ganglion [548], connected also with the auriculo- temporal nerve and with the small superficial petrosal which passes forwards on the petrous bone imme- diately external to the hiatus Fallopii [551]. In this dissection the Eustachian tube [674] is within view, and can be still more fully displayed in that part of its cartilaginous extent which is close to the base of the skull, by removing the thin lamina of the great wing of the sphenoid bone internal to the foramen ovale. The branches of the otic ganglion can then be seen [549], one backwards to the tensor tympani [672], which is a small muscle lying along the Eustachian tube, and the other downwards to the tensor or cir- cumfiexus palati [348], which muscle is seen arising in part from the downward-curving outer border of the cartilage of the tube. On one side, however, it is well to refrain from this dissection, in order that at a later period the ganglion may be seen from the deep aspect. Proceeding now to the dissection of the ear, the pinna [668] may be first dissected by removal of the integument, so as to show the cartilage and muscles. On the foremost part of the helix is its greater muscle, and below this, at its extremity, dipping into the concha, is its smaller muscle [669]. On the outside of the tragus and antitragus are the two muscles which take name from those eminences; while on the back of the pinna are two small muscles, one, the transverse, stretching across the groove corresponding to the antihelix, and the other, the oblique, across the groove corresponding to the lower of the two parts into which

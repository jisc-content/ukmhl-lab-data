DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 183 inferior phrenic, the suprarenal, the superior mesen- teric, the renal, and the spermatic or ovarian. The great splanchnic nerves will be seen piercing the crura of the diaphragm to reach the semilunar ganglia, while the smaller splanchnic nerves end in the coeliac and renal plexuses. Still continuing the dissection of the sympathetic nerves downwards, we come to the aortic plexus, the exhibition of which has been already recommended at a prior period. The dissector having displayed these plexuses is now in a position to make a continuous dissection of the abdominal aorta from the diaphragm to its bifurcation [447]; and he may also dissect out the common and external iliac arteries and veins; and crossing over those great vessels he will see the ureters, and the spermatic or ovarian vessels, descend- ing in front of them. In addition to the aortic branches already seen, he will now observe the branches to the parietes; viz., the inferior phrenic arteries [447] given off by the aorta immediately on entering the abdomen, the lumbar arteries four on each side, and the middle sacral [448] descending from the neighbourhood of the bifurcation. By raising the right cms of the diaphragm a little from the aorta, the commencement of the thoracic duct, called receptacidum chyli [497], may be brought into view. On the sides of the vertebras are the right and left lumbar and ascending lumbar veins [480]. The position of the kidneys [759] in relation to the vertebras and other structures of the abdominal wall is to be observed, as also the relations of the struc- tures at the hilus; namely, the vein in front, the

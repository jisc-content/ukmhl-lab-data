122 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. part of the orbital wall may be removed entirely, and afterwards the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone may be nipped away with the bone-nippers till the anterior wall of the spheno-maxillary fossa is removed. There will then be obtained a view of the sphenopalatine or Meckel's ganglion [545], with the nasal and naso-palatine branches passing through the spheno-palatine foramen, the three palatine branches, one of them much larger than the others, extending downwards, and the Vidian nerve, with the minute branch termed pharyngeal, passing backwards. Also the third part of the internal maxillary artery [419], ending in posterior dental, infraorbital, palatal, Vidian and nasal branches, will be seen. The anterior dental nerve may now be followed down for a short distance in the anterior wall of the maxillary antrum, and the dissector should seek for the communicating branches extending along bony canals between the anterior and posterior dental nerves. The side of the skull should now be removed down to the level of the petrous bone, the portion of the sphenoid bone external to the foramen ovale taken away, and the Vidian canal laid open so as to follow the Vidian nerve [545] backwards. It will be found to divideâ€”one branch, the great deep petrosal, joining the carotid plexus of the sympathetic, while the other, the great superficial petrosal, may be traced by the outside of the carotid artery to the hiatus Fallopii on the anterior surface of the petrous bone. By breaking open the foramen ovale, the inferior maxillary can be laid bare from its origin; its branch to the internal pterygoid will be seen to reach that muscle from

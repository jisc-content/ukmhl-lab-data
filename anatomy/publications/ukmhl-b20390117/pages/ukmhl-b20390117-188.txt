178 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. foramen of Winslow, between the folds of the small omentum. It divides into the right and left hepatic artery before entering the liver, and from the right hepatic the small cystic artery is given off to the gall-bladder. But before its bifurcation the hepatic artery will be seen to give off other branches, namely, the pyloric branch which runs from right to left to meet the coronary artery on the small curvature of the stomach, and the much larger gastro-duodenal branch which again divides into right gastroepiploic anastomosing with the left gastroepi- ploic on the great curvature of the stomach, and the superior pancreaticoduodenal which meets the inferior pancreaticoduodenal branch of the superior mesenteric on the concavity of the duodenum. This last-named branch may be followed to its source, and the superior mesenteric may be dissected up to its origin beneath the pancreas.1 The three branches of the coeliac axis are each accompanied by a plexus of sympathetic nerves, which takes its name from the artery. These should be recognised and followed back to the coeliac plexus. Eeturning the stomach to its natural position, the dissector should now remove the whole of the remain- ing peritoneum of the small omentum, and bring fully into view the common bile-duct (ductus communis choledochus) to the right of the hepatic artery, and trace up from it the two ducts with which it is continuous, namely, the cystic duct coming from the 1 To prevent confusion it is necessary to warn the student that one or both of the branches to the liver may come from the superior mesenteric artery.

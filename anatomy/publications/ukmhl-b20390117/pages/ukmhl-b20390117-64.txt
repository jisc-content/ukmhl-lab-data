56 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. In it are to be found, close to the outside and under cover of the sartorius, the attachment of the rectus femoris [299] to the anterior inferior spine of the ilium, and, internal to this, the conjoined psoas magnus and iliacus muscles [301, 302], the iliacus to the outside and muscular, the psoas to the inside and tendinous; and descending along the groove between them is the trunk of the anterior crural nerve [527]. To the inner side of the nerve are the femoral artery and vein; and to the inner side of the vessels, and passing down behind them, the pectineus muscle [295]. Internal to the pectineus is the adductor longus, and still more internally the gracilis muscle forms the inner border of the dissection, while in an interval between the adductor longus and pectineus is seen a small portion of the adductor hrevis descending from behind the former to be inserted behind the latter [295]. The commencement of the profunda femoris artery will also be seen in the space, with the origins of its external and internal circumflex branches [459]. Below the level of Scarpa's space the femoral artery, with the vein now placed behind it, is to be followed downwards where it is covered by the sartorius muscle, and below the middle of the thigh it will be seen to become covered by a tendinous ex- pansion stretching from the tendons of the adductors longus and magnus behind to the vastus internus in front, which conceals it till it pierces the tendon of the adductor magnus [304]. In the passage thus formed, termed Hunter's canal, it gives off the anastomotica magna [460], and is accompanied by the internal saphenous nerve, a branch of the anterior

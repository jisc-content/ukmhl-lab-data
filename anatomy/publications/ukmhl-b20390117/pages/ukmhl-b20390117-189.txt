DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 179 gall-bladder, and the hepatic dud formed by the union of right and left ducts [732]; also, behind the duct and artery, the portal vein [690, 482] will be brought into view. At this stage the terminal branches of the right and left pneumogastric nerves should be followed respectively from the back and front of the oesophagus, down on the stomach [558], and in a good subject filaments may be traced from them to the hepatic, cceliac and splenic plexuses. The portal vein [482] is then to be traced up to its bifurcation into right and left portal before entering the liver, and back- wards to its sources of origin so as to show the veins of the intestines uniting into inferior and superior mesenteric veins, and passing up behind the pancreas to fall into the splenic vein and thereby constitute the trunk of the portal vein which is joined by the coronary vein of the stomach and by the pyloric, while the right portal receives the cystic vein. The manner in which the pancreas is expanded at its right extremity, so as to form what is designated its head, filling up the concavity of the duodenum, is now to be noticed, and by a slight search into the centre of the body of the gland, the main duct of the pancreas will be found [729]. This duct is to be traced through the length of the gland to its termination in the duodenum, close to the bile-duct; and near its termination it will usually be found connected with a smaller duct, opening separately, from the upper part of the head. The liver, stomach, duodenum, pancreas and spleen are now to be removed; and for this purpose it is well first to raise the duodenum, and to dissect out

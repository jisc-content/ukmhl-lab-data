174 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. the abdomen is called the transverse mesocolon [691]. Also the lobulus Spigelii can now be seen pointing downwards, and, behind the posterior wall of the sac, the pancreas [690, 728] lying transversely with the splenic artery and vein above it. On thrusting the hand upwards behind the stomach, the gastro-hepatic omentum is found to be continued on the left into the gastrophrenic ligament [691]; and at the left side of the stomach the fold joining that viscus to the spleen is displayed, the gastro-splenic omentum [690]. The peri- toneal relations of the duodenum can also now be more fully seen. 5. The Mesenteric Vessels and the Intestines.â€” The transverse colon is to be again thrown upwards against the ribs, and the small intestines are to be turned over to the left side. The exposed layer of peritoneum of the mesentery is then to be stripped off, and the process of stripping is to be continued till the whole series of ramifications of blood-vessels belonging to the jejunum, ileum, and ascending and transverse colon is exposed. The arteries will be seen to emanate from one trunk, the superior mesen- teric [450], which gives off from one side numerous branches to the small intestine, and from the other the middle colic, right colic, and ileo-colic branches. The main arches of anastomosis and the small arches on their convexities are to be cleared as far as the intestinal wall, partly by scraping with the handle of the scalpel, and partly by means of careful dissection, so as to expose not only the arteries and the accom- panying tributaries of the superior mesenteric vein [483], but also numerous twigs of sympathetic nerve

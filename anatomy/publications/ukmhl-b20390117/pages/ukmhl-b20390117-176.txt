166 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. he will observe what structures will be pushed before each form of hernia so as to constitute its coverings. The fascia transversalis and subperitoneal fat of the groin are now to be turned aside from the peritoneum, which is to be detached from them and from the deep side of Poupart's ligament. By this means a view will be obtained, from the inside, of the relations of the transversalis fascia [383] bound down to Poupart's ligament below, and the iliac fascia [382] reaching that structure from the iliac fossa, and also of the parts involved in the descent of a femoral hernia. Over the external iliac artery and vein, where they are continuous with the femoral vessels, an arch formed by the fascia transversalis will be seen, the deep crural arch [384], and on the inside of the vein a small space, the crural ring, occupied by the thin septum crurale, and forming the upper ex- tremity of the crural canal, the passage through which femoral hernia is wont to descend into the thigh, and belonging to the dissection of that part [384]. The origins of the deep circumflex iliac and epigastric arteries from the external iliac will be made evident, and in a certain number of subjects the obturator artery [453], which more frequently comes from the internal iliac, will be seen to arise in whole or in part from the epigastric [457], an arrangement which complicates the relations of a femoral hernia when the descending artery passes internal to the crural ring. After examination of these things, Poupart's ligament may be more fully examined than was possible previously, and Gimbernafs ligament [376] may be seen, consisting of the fibres extending from the inner fourth of

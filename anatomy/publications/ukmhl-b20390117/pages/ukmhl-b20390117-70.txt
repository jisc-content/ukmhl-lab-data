62 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. femur, so as to show the transverse position of the line of origin of the inner head and the longitudinal and lower position of the outer head which is in con- tact with the belly of the plantaris muscle. Beneath the inner head and separating it from the tendon of the semimembranosus a bursa will be found which usually communicates with the knee-joint, and is sometimes the seat of a glairy accumulation. The tendinous expansions on the opposed surfaces of the soleus and gastrocnemius are to be noted, and between them the tendon of the 'plantaris muscle [314], which may be divided. The plantaris muscle is sometimes absent. The 'popliteal artery [461] is now laid thoroughly bare as far as the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it divides into anterior and posterior tibial; its relation to the internal popliteal nerve at the lower part can be more fully seen ; and the nerve from the internal popliteal to the popliteus muscle is to be found descending outside the vessels to the lower border of the muscle, beneath which it turns; also the branch to the soleus, which is of larger size, will be followed down. The popliteus muscle [314] will be observed to be covered with an aponeurosis connected with the insertion of the semi- membranosus [294], which may be either raised at the present stage or left untouched till the knee-joint is dissected, as until then the femoral attachment and the action of the popliteus cannot be properly studied. The tibial and fibular attachments of the soleus muscle may now be divided close to the bone, atten- tion being paid to their extent [313]; and the deep surface of the soleus muscle is to be carefully cleaned,

71 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. external malleolus to its insertion into the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal bone, and in doing this the external annular ligament and further on the loops which bind down the tendons separately should be noticed. The peroneus longus will be seen entering the groove on the cuboid bone; but the sheath which contains it in its course across the sole to the base of the first metatarsal bone cannot be opened at present without injury to the ligaments of the foot. Lastly, the interosseous muscles are to be dissected [322]; and to do this thoroughly the transverse metatarsal ligament [327] must be sacrificed. Three plantar interossei will be found arising from the plantar surface of the three outer metatarsal bones and inserted on the inner sides of the corresponding first phalanges; and four dorsal interossei arising from the adjacent metatarsal bones bounding each of the interosseous spaces are inserted, the innermost into the inner side of the first phalanx of the second toe, and the others into the outer sides of the second, third and fourth toes. In the three outer interosseous spaces the three posterior perforating arteries passing between the dorsal interosseous digital arteries and the plantar arch are to be noted. In each of the four spaces anteriorly an anterior perforating artery passes between the dorsal and plantar digital artery. 7. The Knee-joint and Articulations of the Foot. â€”The anastomoses of the articular branches of the popliteal artery, the anastomotic of the femoral and the recurrent of the anterior tibial are to be traced [461], The insertions of muscles around the knee, not as yet

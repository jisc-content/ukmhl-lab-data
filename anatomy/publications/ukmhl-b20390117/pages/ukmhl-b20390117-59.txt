DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 51 liteal artery enters the popliteal space from the front by turning round the inner side of the femur, it is deeper than the internal popliteal nerve and to its inner side above, while, being destined to divide into two vessels below, the inner of which (the posterior tibial artery) is accompanied by the continuation of the nerve, it is naturally crossed by the nerve in the lower part of the space. The origins of the five articular branches of the popliteal artery will also be seen at this time, namely, an outer and inner superior articular branch, an outer and inner inferior articular, and an azygos branch coming off directly or from the upper and outer branch. The articular twigs of nerve already alluded to correspond with the arteries; and before the popliteal trunk is cleaned the terminal twig of the posterior branch of the obturator nerve to the knee-joint [527], if not pre- viously exhibited, should be seen piercing the adductor magnus and descending on the artery to reach the back of the joint. The integument and fascia lata separating the popliteal from the gluteal dissection are to be divided. The great and small sciatic nerves can then be traced backwards to the gluteal dissection. The muscular branches of the former nerve to the biceps, semi- tendinosus, and semimembranosus muscles may be at the same time followed, as also another to assist the supply of the adductor magnus [532]. The three hamstring muscles are to be fully dissected out, including the short head of the biceps [292]; and the shortness of the fibres of the semimembranosus [294] and the tendinous intersection of the semitendinosus

100 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. edge of the sterno-mastoid, and splitting into two sheets which, meeting the corresponding sheets from the other side, enclose, in the region below the hyoid bone, a median interfascial space, the walls of which are attached below to the sternum. Another layer, still deeper, extends down into the thorax [356]. These and the other structures met with near the middle line are to be studied in relation to the opera- tion of tracheotomy. The other structures are the inferior thyroid veins [470], the ima thyroidea artery [413] when it is present, the isthmus of the thyroid body above [756], the innominate artery [412] below, and on each side of the trachea the common carotid [413], with the internal jugular vein and pneumo- gastric nerve accompanying it. In the upper part of the anterior triangle of the neck is to be exposed the digastric muscle [338], the posterior belly of which, together with the stylo-hyoid muscle [339] extending from behind the ear to the hyoid bone, separates the district below the chin known as the digastric space from the neck proper. The nerve (from the third division of the fifth) [548] to the anterior belly of the digastric will be found at its outer border near the jaw, and, traced backwards, will be seen to be one of the branches of a small trunk, the other branch of which enters, from the superficial aspect, the mylo-hyoid [338], the flat muscle beneath the anterior belly of the digastric. The superficial and larger part of the submaxillary gland [707] must at the same time be dissected out, with the trunk of the facial artery [416], which is in close connection with it and furnishes it with twigs, and

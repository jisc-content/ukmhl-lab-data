DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 13 posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis muscle [378] : but leave all these structures un- divided. The division of the rhomboid and latissi- mus dorsi permits the scapula to be sufficiently drawn away from the thoracic parietes to bring into view the deep surface of the serratus magnus [256] extending forwards from the deep side of the vertebral margin of the scapula; and the lower margin of that muscle can be studied, as well as the relation of its superior margin to the levator anguli scapulae [256], a muscle with which in some animals it is quite continuous. Above the upper margin of the serratus magnus, passing downwards to its superficial surface, will be found the external respiratory nerve of Bell [516]. The nerve passes through the fibres of the middle scalenus muscle a little lower than the nerve to the rhomboids. There is now laid bare an aponeurosis which covers- in the deep muscles of the back, and is called the vertebral aponeurosis in the dorsal part of its extent, and the posterior layer of the lumbar aponeurosis in its lower part [365]. Along with this aponeurosis, passing outwards to the upper and lower ribs respec- tively, are the serratus posticus superior and inferior muscles [371]. These are to be defined and studied, and, together with the aponeurosis, are then to be divided, when the erector spinw muscle will be brought into view [358]. Before beginning the examination of the erector spinse, it is well that the splenius [358], a fleshy muscle of the neck, extending upwards and outwards from the middle line to the skull and upper cervical transverse processes, should be divided near

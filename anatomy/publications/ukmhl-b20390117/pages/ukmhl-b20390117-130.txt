120 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. which is to be sought between the heads of the external rectus, and further forwards the long ciliary branches, and the infratrochlear, which is to be fol- lowed forward to the inner canthus and side of the nose. The third nerve [539] is also to be traced; its upper division to the upper rectus muscle and the levator palpebrse may always be easily found, as its branches enter the deep surface of the muscles; its lower division to the inferior and inner recti and inferior oblique is of considerable size. The sixth nerve [549] is to be followed into the external rectus muscle. The inferior oblique muscle [335] is best brought into view by dividing the conjunctiva below the eyeball, and seeking for the muscle at its origin at the inner part of the orbit, near its margin. By pulling on the recti muscles it will be noted that they are connected anteriorly by fascial slips with the orbital margins. These slips, which are strongest in the cases of the external and internal muscles, may be dissected to their anterior attachments [336]. There remain still for examination the lachrymal apparatus, the inner surface of the eyelids, and the tensor tarsi muscle. The caruncnlai, plica semilunaris, and puncta lachrymalia should be looked at in the living subject; and, after that, bristles may be passed into the puncta on the dead subject, and an effort made to follow the canaliculi [645, 646]. The levator palpebral muscle is then to be divided, and the orbi- cularis palpebrarum and the eyelids should be raised from their connections above, below, and on the outside, and turned over towards the nose. By this means the tarsal conjunctiva, with the outlines of

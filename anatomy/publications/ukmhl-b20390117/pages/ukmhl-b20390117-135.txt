DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 125 applications of the bone-nippers, beginning by laying open the internal auditory meatus from above and extending the unroofing process forwards and back- wards, the cochlea [678J may be seen to lie with its base at the fore part of the cribriform plate, its cavity coiled in two circles and a half round the modiolus or central pillar from which the lamina spiralis projects into it; and the cavity of the vestibule [676] will be opened into, opposite the hinder part of the cribriform plate, while the semicircular canals can be seen in section, the superior canal crossing the axis of the pars petrosa vertically, the posterior lying close to its posterior surface, and the external placed horizontally. In making this dissection the first care should be to follow the facial nerve [550] to the place where it turns downwards, and to show the great and small superficial petrosal nerves [551] joining its geniculate ganglion; and in doing this the cochlea and vestibule will be more or less fully exposed. The fenestra ovalis and fenestra rotunda should be looked at from the vestibular side, and the mode noted in which the stapes is pressed inwards at the former when the handle of the malleus is pulled in [671]. Afterwards, the descending part of the aquseductus Fallopii may be laid open, and at the same time the muscular belly of the stapedius muscle [672], which lies close to the facial nerve, may be exposed, as also the origin of the chorda tympani from the facial nerve [551]. The styloid process should now be nipped across, and together with the muscles attached to it should be turned forwards; the upper parts of the glosso- pharyngeal [553], vagus [555], and spinal accessory [558]

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 81 be injured when the calvarium is replaced after ex- amination of the brain; but for anatomical purposes it is preferable to direct the incision along the middle line from above the nose to the occipital tuberosity. The knife is to be carried quite down to the bone, dividing the integument, subcutaneous fat, occipito- frontal aponeurosis and the pericranium; and with the fingers and the handle of the scalpel the pericranium is then to be detached from the skull and the scalp is to be reflected. At the sides, however, it will be found that the temporal fascia [344] will remain at- tached along by the temporal ridge with the temporal muscle taking origin beneath it; and these structures must be divided at the level at which the saw is to be carried round the skull. This level should be in front about an inch above the orbits, and behind should pass through the probole or most prominent part of the occipital bone, a little lower down when the subject is on its face than when it is placed on its back. Only the external table of the skull is to be sawn through; the inner table should be left uninjured. To divide the inner table resort is to be had to the chisel and mallet, with which it may be cracked completely round by a few sharp strokes. The chisel may then be inserted in the middle line in front or behind, and turned forcibly round so as to tear the calvarium away from the dura mater adherent to the deep table. In the middle line of the exposed part of the dura mater [577] will be seen a venous channel contained in its substance, the superior longitudinal sinus [475], which should be opened into, so as to exhibit its F

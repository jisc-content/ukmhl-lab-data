168 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. The testicle is now to be removed by dividing the spermatic cord, and is to be laid out for dissection on the table or on a flat dish with a little spirit or water in it. The vas deferens and other structures of the cord are to be followed to the testicle. The tunica vaginalis [771, 772], or serous investment of the testicle, is then to be opened by an incision made down the front, when the body of the testicle en- closed in the tunica albuginea will come into view, with the globus major of the epididymis above, the globus minor below, and the body of the epididymis separated from the back part of the outer side of the testis by the digital fossa. In front of the globus major will be found a little appendage, and sometimes a cyst or two, the hydatid of Morgagni, a vestige of the Wolffian body. The parietal layer of the tunica vaginalis, and the rest of the tissue round the testicle, may now be cleared away, the con- tinuity of the vas deferens and globus minor of the epididymis at the lower end of the testicle may be exhibited, and the epididymis may be partially un- ravelled [775, 776]. The globus major may be now raised from the tunica albuginea, and beneath it, if the dissection be made carefully, a series of little cones may be displayed with their apices next to the testis, their bases connected with the epididymis: these are the coni vasculosi [775], from ten to fifteen in number, and, if difficulty be found in exhibiting them, they may be stretched on glass, and dissected with transmitted light. The tunica albuginea, the fibrous investment of the testis proper, is now to be divided down the front, and from its deep surface thin septa

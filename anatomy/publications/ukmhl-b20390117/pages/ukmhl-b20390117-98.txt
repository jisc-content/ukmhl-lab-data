88 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. wards, in the angle between the pons, the medulla and the flocculus or subpedunculatecl lobe of the cere- bellum, are the seventh and eighth nerves. The inner of the two is the seventh or facial (portio dura of the seventh of Willis), while the outer is the eighth or auditory nerve (portio mollis of the seventh of Willis). The medulla oblongata [595], on being carefully denuded of its membranes, is seen to exhibit on each side of the middle line three elevations—the anterior ptjramid, the olivary body, and the restiform body, the latter entering the cerebellum. In front of the olivary body is the twelfth, or hypoglossal nerve; and between the olivary and restiform bodies are the ■ninth, tenth and eleventh nerves, viz., above, a small division, the glossopharyngeal or ninth; below it the much larger vagus or pneumogastric or tenth; and lowest of the three the spinal accessory or eleventh, the whole origin of which can seldom be removed with the brain. In the anterior mesial fissure is to be laid bare the decussation of the pyramids, and beneath the olivary body the arciform fibres will be seen. 4. Cerebral Convolutions and Sulci [625-627].— These can only be studied with advantage on a hardened specimen denuded of its membranes; but if a brain so prepared is not available, it will be well to examine them as far as possible before proceeding with the dissection. Behind the fissure of Sylvius and beneath its posterior limb will be noticed the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, and the three convolutions of its outer surface

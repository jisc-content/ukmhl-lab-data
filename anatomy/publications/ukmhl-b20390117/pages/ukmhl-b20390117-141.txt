DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 131 The movements of the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages on the cricoid cartilage, their influence on the posi- tion and tension of the vocal cords, and the muscles by which they are effected, ought to be carefully studied. The nasal fossae are now to be examined; and for this purpose the cribriform plate and the portions of the frontal and sphenoid bones in front and behind it should be sawn close to the middle line on the side least dissected; the saw should then be withdrawn, and the palate should be sawn through on the same side from below. The septum of the nose should be denuded of its mucous membrane, and the nasopala- tine nerve [545] should be looked for in its course from Meckel's ganglion to the anterior palatine fora- men ; and in a favourable specimen it, as well as the accompanying branch of the internal maxillary artery, may be traced to the palate, and the communication of the nerves of opposite sides, after passing through the foramina of Scarpa, may be shown. The three meatus of the nose are to be next examined. The relations of the upper meatus to the ethmoidal cells and sphenoidal sinus, the opening of the maxillary antrum into the middle meatus, and the communi- cation of that meatus with the frontal sinus through the infundibulum in its fore part should be looked at [640, 238]; also the direction, in the inferior meatus, which a probe or canula must take to reach the nasal duct, and the Eustachian tube [675]. The inferior turbinated bone should then be in part removed to exhibit the character of the orifice of the nasal duct. An additional dissection of the otic ganglion [548]

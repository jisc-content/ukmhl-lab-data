DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 169 [773], which must be severed, will be seen to pass between the masses of the secreting substance. Also it will be found to be lined with a thin coating of loose tissue, which in finely injected specimens is seen to consist principally of small blood-vessels, forming the tunica vasculosa [773]. In fluid, the secret- ing substance is readily separated into a multitude of lobules, and these are easily shown by slight teasing to consist of delicate convoluted tubules, very slightly adherent to one another. On dividing the testicle transversely, a section of the mediastinum testis or corpus Highmorianum will be seen, a projection for- wards from the back of the tunica albuginea; but the entrance of the seminal tubules by tubuli recti into this mediastinum, the rete testis in its substance and the emergence of the vasa efferentia to form the coni vasculosi are matters too delicate to be seen without resort to special modes of preparation. 4. Peritoneum and Position of Viscera.â€”The abdominal cavity is to be thoroughly opened by the completion of a crucial incision extending longitudin- ally from sternum to pubes, and through the umbilicus from side to side. The position of the viscera should be first examined. Above, in the right hypochondriac and the epigastric region, is the liver [730], and the extent which it occupies is to be noted. In the left hypochondriac and the epigastric region is the stomach, varying in bulk according to the degree of inflation; and when the cardiac extremity of the stomach is raised, the spleen, attached to it well back on the left, will be brought into view. Below the stomach, connected closely by peritoneum with its pyloric end,

147 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. right ventricle, and the curious moderator band when present. The much more copious network of trabecular in the left ventricle and the greater thickness of its walls will attract attention. Before opening the left auricle [402], the inferior vena cava should be divided and the heart turned upwards, so as to show the position of the auricle with its posterior wall symmetrically disposed across the middle line, and the pulmonary veins opening into it from each side. The posterior wall may then be divided by an incision across its lower part, carried upwards at each extremity close to the entrance of the veins. The freedom of the auricular wall from musculi pectinati, save only in the appendix, will be seen, and some irregular depressions opposite the interauricular septum. A probe may be passed from the right auricle forwards under cover of the annulus oralis, and in many instances will pass into the left auricle through a narrow channel, the remains of the foetal foramen ovale. The arch of the aorta may now be cut across in the middle of its ascending part, and, while the superficial cardiac nerves are still left intact, those passing down in front of the trachea to form the deep plexus [565] may be dissected fully out; the ganglion of Wrisberg, if present, will be seen close between the aorta and pulmonary artery, and the plexus may be traced onwards to the coronary vessels, on which the nerves have already been exposed, and to the anterior pulmonary plexuses. The pulmonary artery and veins and the vena cava superior being then divided, the heart will be removed from the body. The

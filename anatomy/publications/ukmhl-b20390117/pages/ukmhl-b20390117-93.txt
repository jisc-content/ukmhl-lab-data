DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 83 in situ, before removal of the basal parts, is to be preferred to immediate removal, as it allows the interior to be seen without accidental laceration or disturbance, and when the anterior parts have been first disposed of, the base can be spread out advan- tageously for display. The method of removal varies according to the position of the subject. If the subject be on its face, the posterior lobes of the hemispheres should be raised; the edge of the knife should be applied to the free margin of the tentorium close to the border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and by a firm cut the fourth and fifth nerves (patheticus and trifacial, fig. 402) may be divided along with the tentorium without being pre- viously brought into view. The knife is then to be carried along the outer attachment of the tentorium to within an inch of the middle line; at the middle of the free edge the vena magna Galeni [474] is to be divided, and the tentorium and falx may then be thrown back, the lobes of the cerebellum raised, the spinal cord and vertebral arteries in front of it cut across as low down in the spinal canal as possible, and the nerves divided in series from below upwards, close to the places where they pierce the dura mater. After dividing the third pair, the dissector will see the infundibulum descending to the pituitary body in the sella turcica [594], and on division of it will find on each side further forward the internal carotid artery with the optic nerve immediately in front of it â€¢ and on division of these the brain can be removed, care being taken to raise with it the olfactory lobes from

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 185 and the different modes of formation of the openings for the aorta, oesophagus and vena cava inferior are to be observed. Escaping from under cover of the ligamentum arcuatum externum the trunk of the last dorsal nerve [524] will be seen. The psoas magnus and iliacus muscles [301, 302] are next to be cleaned, as also the psoas parvus [302] if present. The presence of the psoas parvus is recognised by its long shining tendon on the sur- face of the psoas magnus. In cleaning the psoas magnus, care is to be taken of the genito-crural nerve [526], which pierces it, either as one trunk, or in two places after separation into genital and crural branches. The genital branch is to be traced to the inguinal canal, and the crural branch to its point of emergence from the abdomen outside the external iliac artery. External to the psoas magnus are to be dissected out the fascia iliaca [382] and the iliacus muscle, also the other branches of the lumbar plexus, namely, the Uio-hypogastric nerve [525] crossing the quadratus lumborum towards the outer part of the crest of the ilium ; the ilio-inguinal [525] distinguished from the ilio-hypogastric, when separated from it, by crossing a small part of the iliacus muscle; the external cutaneous [526] passing towards the anterior superior spine of the ilium ; and the large trunk of the anterior crural [527] hid in the groove between the psoas and iliacus muscles. Beneath the inner side of the psoas magnus will be found the remaining branch of distribution of the lumbar plexus, the obturator nerve [526], making for the obturator foramen, but occasionally giving off a small branch, the accessory

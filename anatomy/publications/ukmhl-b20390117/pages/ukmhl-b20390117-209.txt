BY JOHN CLELAND, M.D., LL.D., D.Sc, F.R.S., Professor of Anatomy in the University of Glasgow ; AND JOHN YULE MACKAY, M.D., CM., Principal and Professor of Anatomy in University College, Dundee, the University of St. Andrews ; late Senior Demonstrator in the University of Glasgow. "One cannot read this book without being forced to think, and without acquiring a feeling of reverence and admiration for the anatomist who is able to speak authoritatively, and from personal observation, upon so many varied and intricate morphological problems. . . . Dr. Mackay's de- scriptions of the muscles, heart, vessels and nerves are written in clear and vigorous language, and his account of the morphology of these structures points him out as a thoughtful and discriminating anatomist. . . • We heartily commend the book to all students engaged in the study of anatomy." —Edinburgh Medical Journal. "The more we read Professor Cleland's Manual of Anatomy the more we like it, for each time we find new features in its favour. Many of our text-books on anatomy are now overcrowded with facts, often ill-arranged and indifferently described ; Professor Cleland, however, has produced a work which, while it contains everything of importance, is not thus over congested. His descriptions are clear, concise, accurate, and comprehensive, and some of the most difficult points are rendered exceedingly simple."— Scottish Medical and Surgical Journal* '.' \ " The book is well written, and we can recommend it as a useful text-book in all the ordinary examinations in anatomy."^-jLancet.

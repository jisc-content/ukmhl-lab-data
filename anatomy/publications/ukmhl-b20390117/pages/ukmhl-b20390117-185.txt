DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 175 [566], and the mesenteric glands [499] with afferent lacteal trunks entering them, and efferent vessels pro- ceeding upwards and backwards from them. The small intestines are then to be turned to the right side, and the left branch of the middle colic artery is to be followed till it leads to the left colic branch of the inferior mesenteric artery [450]; the peritoneum is then to be stripped from that artery and its other branches, namely, the branch to the sigmoid flexure and the superior hcemorrhoidal branching down to the rectum. At this stage it is well to follow back the nerves which accompany the inferior mesenteric artery, and dissect out the aortic plexus [567], which consists mainly of two lateral cords descending on the aorta and passing onwards below its bifurcation to unite in the upper part of the pelvis to form a band about half an inch or more in breadth, the hypogastric plexus [567]. It is convenient in most instances, at this stage to remove the greater part of the intestines for examination. This is to be done by tying it at two places about an inch apart at the commence- ment of the jejunum, and similarly at two places in the sigmoid flexure, and dividing it between each pair of ligatures, then seizing the cut end of the jejunum with the left hand, holding the edge of the knife against the attached side, and severing by a slight sawing movement the mesentery from the intestine, which is quickly liberated and pulled away. The great intestine is then removed with ease. The intestines thus removed are to be taken

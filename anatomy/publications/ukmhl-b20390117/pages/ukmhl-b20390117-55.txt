DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 47 accompanying it, the small sciatic nerve [531], and the inferior gluteal nerve already noticed; then the great sacro-sciatic ligament, and in front of it the spine of the ischium with the small sacro-sciatic liga- ment extending inwards from it [185], and the pudic vessels [454, 482] and nerve [531], and the nerve to the obturator internus passing over it into the pelvis; and emerging from the small sacro-sciatic foramen the obturator internus tendon, which is continued out- wards with the gemellus superior and inferior above and below it [291]. Piercing the great sacro-sciatic ligament will be found the coccygeal branch of the sciatic artery and the perforating cutaneous branch of the fourth sacral nerve [536], and either upon the surface or within the substance of the ligament two or three loops of nerve formed by the junction of the external branches of the posterior primary divisions of the last lumbar and upper three sacral nerves [511]. The branches forming these loops may be traced back to another set of loops upon the posterior surface of the sacrum close to the foramina through which the posterior divisions of the nerves emerge. Extending outwards from the outer edge of the tuberosity of the ischium is the quadratus femoris muscle [291], which, together with the gemellus inferior, is supplied by a small nerve from the sacral plexus emerging under cover of the great sciatic nerve and descending between the obturator internus tendon and the bone. Internal to this are seen, descending from the ischial tuberosity, the combined origin of the semitendinosus and long head of the biceps, and the flat tendon of the semi-

184 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. ureter behind, and the artery between [760]. The kidney is then to be removed, the fibrous capsule is to be divided and stripped off, and a vertical trans- verse incision is to be made through the organ to display its internal structure [761]. The division into cortical and medullary substance is to be studied. With a lens there may be noted in a healthy kidney, not only the alternation of granular and striated appearance in the cortex, but also minute vesicles in the granular part, which are the Malpighian bodies. The origin of the ureter in a dilated pelvis subdivided into calyces, each containing the papillary extremity of one of the Malpighian pyramids into which the medullary part is thrown, will be noted; and the pyramids may be counted; and if one of them be squeezed, moisture will emerge from its apex; and with a lens a number of little depressions at the apex may be seen, into which the uriniferous tubules open. 8. The Posterior Abdominal Wall.â€”If the anterior parts of the thoracic wall have been preserved, the attachments of the diaphragm to the sternum and six lower costal cartilages, and the interdigitation of its slips with those of the transversalis muscle are to be exhibited [367]; then its two crura [368] arising from the bodies of the vertebrae, the ligamentum arcuatum internum arching over the psoas magnus and extending from the body to the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra, and the ligamentum arcuatum externum, arching from the first lumbar transverse process to the last rib over the quadratus lumborum, are all to be dissected out [370]. Also, the positions

DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 11 dissection of the muscle is continued. Those from the six upper dorsal nerves appear near the mesial line, being derived from the inner branches of the posterior divisions; the succeeding cutaneous nerves in both dorsal and lumbar regions are further out, being derived from the outer branches [510]. The upper and lower borders of the latissimus dorsi muscle are to be made distinct from the subjacent parts; and in the fascia over its outer edge will be found the posterior twigs of the lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves [523-4]. The origins of the muscle from the ilium and lower ribs and from the inferior angle of the scapula are to be dissected out. In the interval between the trapezius and latissimus dorsi are to be noted a portion of the rhomboideus major and a portion of the thoracic wall, varying in extent according to the position of the scapula. The trapezius muscle is to be divided by means of a vertical incision about an inch from the spines of the vertebrae; and, in association wTith the dissector of the head and neck, this incision may be continued through the cervical part of the muscle. Close to its deep surface are the superficial cervical artery [431] and the spinal accessory nerve [558-9] and one or two branches from the cervical plexus [513], which are on no account to be damaged, even by a junior dissector, but to be preserved, so as to have their continuity from above displayed by the dissector of the head and neck. The rhomboideus major and minor muscles [255] are to be freed from fascia, care being taken not to injure

98 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. distinguished as supra-sternal, supra-clavicular, and supra-acromial. 7. Posterior Triangle.â€”In pursuing the dissection just made, a considerable amount of loose connective tissue will be found, in which the descending cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus are embedded. This is now to be removed; the posterior border of the sterno-mmtoid muscle [351] and anterior border of the trapezius [253] are to be cleared, and the dis- position of the fascia stretching between them is to be noted. In the lower part of the space will be seen the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle [350] extending backwards and downwards, and bound down by an important layer of deep fascia, which invests it and is attached inferiorly to the clavicle. This belly of muscle subdivides the posterior triangle [352]. The superior division of the triangle may be cleared out first. In its upper part, connected with the descending cutaneous nerves, will be found the spinal accessory nerve [558], which is to be followed from its place of exit from the sterno-mastoid to its disappearance beneath the trapezius muscle, and also two or three muscular branches from the cervical plexus. A chain of lymphatic glands (glandulce con- mt&natce) is to be displayed along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle and on its deep surface [505]. Forming the floor of this upper part of the posterior triangle will be found the upper portions of the splenius capitis and colli [358], of the levator anguli scapulce [256], and of the scaleni [353] muscles. The deep fascia binding down the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle is now to be removed, and

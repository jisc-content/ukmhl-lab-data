53 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. of the long or internal saphenous vein [486] is seen ascending, receiving usually a large tributary on its inner side, and disappearing from view above. Also some smaller vessels are brought into view, namely, the superficial epigastric artery and vein passing up- wards on the abdomen, the superficial circumflex iliac passing outwards and upwards, and the superior and inferior superficial pudic extending inwards [459]. Superficial to the position of the femoral artery, the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve [526] makes its appearance; and more internally some small twigs of the ilio-inguinal nerve [525]. The fascia where the internal saphenous vein dis- appears is to be carefully cleared, the ducts and other structures connected with the lymphatic glands over it being preserved [305]; and it will be found to con- sist of comparatively loose structure embracing the saphenous vein, perforated by the ducts and blood- vessels of the lymphatic glands and connected round about with the firmer fascia lata; this is the cribriform fascia. Passing the handle of the scalpel in under- neath the saphenous vein where it dips in to join the femoral, a well-defined margin of the fascia lata will be found beneath it, namely, the inferior falciform process of the saphenous opening. Following this margin upwards and outwards it will be found to become less defined, being continued into the cribri form fascia; but it becomes again more definite above and internal to the entrance of the vein, where it forms the superior falciform process. The part of the fascia lata external to this opening is what is called the iliac portion, while the part internal to it, in which

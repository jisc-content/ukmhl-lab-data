Laying hold of the divided end of the inferior vena cava, the dissector may follow the tributaries of that vessel backwards towards their origin [480]: viz., the small veins from the diaphragm and suprarenal capsules; the large renal veins, the left one of which crosses the aorta; the spermatic veins in the male, or ovarian veins in the female, opening, the right one into the vena cava direct, and the left one into the left renal vein; four lumbar veins on each side; and, lastly, the two common iliac veins, by the union of which the vena cava inferior is formed [481]. The union of the common iliac veins is crossed by the right common iliac artery; and the relations of these parts are not to be dis- turbed. The coeliac axis will be found to be surrounded by a thick meshwork of nerves, the coeliac plexus [566]; and when this is followed back and traced outwards at the sides, it is seen to extend into a larger plexus, with a large knotted-looking ganglion, or clump of ganglia on each side : the whole plexus is called the solar plexus, and the ganglionic masses the semilunar ganglia [566]. From this plexus, the smaller plexuses are to be traced along the arteries from which they are named: viz., besides those already seen, the

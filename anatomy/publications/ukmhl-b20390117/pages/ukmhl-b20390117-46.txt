38 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. base of the nail; the adjacent sides of the middle and ring fingers are frequently supplied by a trunk formed partly from both nerves. The aponeurosis is to be afterwards removed from the back of the forearm, care being taken to preserve at the back of the wrist a thickened portion, the posterior annular ligament, which is fastened to the lower ends of the radius and ulna by septa, forming a series of compartments, through which the extensor tendons pass. A series of seven muscles [275-278] will be observed to radiate from the external epicondyle of the humerus and the riclge above it, the outermost of which is the supinator longus, already dissected; while internal to it, in series from without inwards lie the extensores carpi radiates longior et brevior, the extensor digitorum com- munis, the extensor minimi digiti, the extensor carpi ulnaris, and, on the inner and upper border of this, the anconeus, already dissected. The five unexamined are to be dissected now without injury to the vessels and nerves supplying them, and the compartment occupied by each in the posterior annular ligament at the back of the wrist is to be studied. The extensor minimi digiti will be distinguished by its passing through a separate compartment of the annular liga- ment, between the radius and ulna. On the back of the hand the processes given off from the tendon of the ring finger to the tendons of the middle and little finger will be observed, as also the thin transverse aponeurotic band connecting the tendons of the middle and fore finger. The tendons of the extensor communis are to be followed on the fingers, so as to show the insertion of their middle fibres into the

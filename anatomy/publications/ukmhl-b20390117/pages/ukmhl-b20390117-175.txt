DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 165 At this stage it is advisable to divide the recti muscles and open into the cavity of the abdomen by means of a transverse incision at the level of the umbilicus. Stretching upwards from the umbilicus the peritoneal fold containing in its free edge the obliter- ated umbilical vein will be noted. Lifting up the lower part of the abdominal wall, it will then be seen that it is thrown into three fossae below, one in the middle with a slight cord, the remains of the urachus [768] extending up in the middle line from the fundus of the bladder to the umbilicus, and one on each side separated from the middle fossa by the obliterated hypogastric arteries [453], which, ascending on the sides of the bladder, pass likewise to the umbilicus. The deep epigastric artery lies a little to the outside of the obliterated hypogastric, so as to leave an inter- mediate little peritoneal fossa between it and that structure; the space between the deep epigastric artery and the outer border of the rectus muscle is the triangle of Hesselbach [387]. An oblique inguinal hernia leaves the abdominal cavity at the deep ab- dominal ring, and follows the course of the spermatic cord as far as the superficial ring, and that course is named the inguinal canal [384]; while, on the other hand, a direct inguinal hernia leaves the abdomen internal to the epigastric artery in the triangle of Hesselbach, either passing internal or external to the obliterated hypogastric [385]. The student will there- fore take note of the relations which each form of hernia must necessarily have to surrounding parts, especially to the epigastric artery which is internal to an oblique hernia and external to a direct; and

144 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. and also the left vena azygos opening into the great azygos vein on its inner side about half-way down the thorax [479, 480]. The lung is then to be returned into its position. 3. The Pericardium and Heart.â€”The extent and relations of the fibrous layer of the pericardium [685] having been examined from the exterior, the sac is to be opened into by an incision in its whole length, crossed by one dividing it transversely close to the diaphragm. The reflections of the serous layer are then to be examined. The positions of parts are to be observed [406]: namely, the apex of the heart directed forwards, downwards and to the left; the auriculo-ventricular sulcus [400] lying obliquely, with the right side lower than the left; the anterior and posterior interventricular sulci marking the relative positions of the right and left ventricle, the right ventricle being placed below and in front of the left; the two auricular appendices [401], one on each side of the two arterial trunks; the pulmonary artery springing from the right ventricle, the aorta appearing on its right side, and the sulcus between them in the middle line; lastly, the superior [468] and inferior vena cava [480] entering the right auricle from above and below respectively, and, at the upper and back part of the pericardial cavity, the pulmonary veins [410] entering the left auricle, an upper and a lower from each side. The pericardium may now be dissected away from the arch of the aorta, care being taken of the cardiac nerves [557, 565]; and the arch [410, 411], the pulmonary artery, ductus arteriosus, and the systemic [468, 480]

84 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. their resting-places on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. If the subject be lying on its back when the brain is to be removed, the anterior lobes of the hemispheres, with the olfactory bulbs, are to be first raised, the optic nerves, internal carotid arteries, infundibulum and third pair of nerves are then to be severed; and after that the tentorium is to be divided near its attach- ment, the fourth and fifth nerves being divided along with it, then the other nerves in series [fig. 402], and afterwards the vertebral arteries and spinal cord; while last of all, when the brain has been dislodged, it is necessary to divide the vena magna Galeni at the point where the free margins of the falx and tentorium meet [474], to prevent the choroid plexus being torn from its place. When a fresh brain is to be hardened in alcohol, it will be advisable, if possible, to examine the blood- vessels of the base at once, and to remove the whole or the greater part of the arachnoid and pia mater, so as to lay open the sulci and allow ready entrance to the spirit. The cerebellum should also be lifted up a little from the posterior lobes of the cerebrum to allow the pia mater to be dissected at the back of the corpus callosum, so as to give the spirit ingress into the ventricles. 3. Base of Brain and its Vessels,â€”Some folds of calico moistened with preserving fluid having been arranged like a nest on a plate, so as to support the hemispheres, the brain is to be laid on it with the base turned upwards. The student will then observe, in the first place, the main masses of

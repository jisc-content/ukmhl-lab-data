158 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. with the handle of the scalpel, then dividing it in the middle line and continuing the separation, when it will be seen to be firmly bound down at the level of Poupart's ligament, while towards the middle line the space beneath it is continued into the labium in the female, and through the scrotum in the male as far as the fascia of Colles extends. This is why urinary infiltrations pass upwards on the abdomen from the scrotum, but not down into the thighs. At the lower and inner part of the portion of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle brought into view there is a separation in its fibres, the external or, more properly, superficial abdominal ring [376]; and, emerging from this opening in the male is the spermatic cord [771], consisting of structures descending to the testicle; while in the female the same position is occupied by the round ligament of the uterus [787], a structure passing down to be attached in the labium, and, except when the uterus is much enlarged, greatly smaller than the spermatic cord in the male. A little above the superficial abdominal ring, the terminal branch of the ilio-hypogastric nerve [525] pierces the aponeurosis, while through the ring comes the ilio- inguinal nerve [525] to terminate in the pubic in- teguments. The integument may now be reflected from the rest of the abdominal wall; and the subcutaneous fat is then to be removed from the structures underneath, so as at once to clear the aponeurotic anterior wall of the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle [380], separ- ated from that of the opposite side by the linea alba [381] in the middle line; and in removing the fat

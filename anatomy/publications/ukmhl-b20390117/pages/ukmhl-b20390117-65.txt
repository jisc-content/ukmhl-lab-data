DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 57 crural. On the deep surface of the sartorius, con- necting branches pass between the obturator, internal cutaneous and internal saphenous nerves constituting the subsartorial plexus [529]. The gracilis muscle may now be examined in its whole extent, its nerve from the obturator being preserved; and the relations of the tendons of inser- tion of the sartorius, gracilis and semitendinosus muscles below the knee, together with the bursa between the insertions, are to be made out [297, 293]. Behind the lower part of the sartorius the posterior branch of the internal cutaneous nerve and the internal saphenous nerve will be found piercing the fascia [527, 528]. Attention may then be directed to the region external to the upper part of the sartorius. Im- mediately to the outside, the tensor vagince femoris [290] lies covered by the ilio-tibial band of fascia lata, which may be removed from its surface; from its insertion a deep slip of fascia will be followed upwards beneath the rectus femoris to the hip-joint. Behind the tensor vaginas femoris are the remaining parts of the gluteus medius and minimus [289], and when the gluteus medius is reflected the branch of the superior gluteal nerve to the tensor vaginae should be seen. The tensor vaginas femoris is to be divided, and the gluteus medius and minimus are to be thoroughly dissected to their attachments, to show the precise extent of their insertions, as well as the bursas between them and the great trochanter, and the arch of fibres by means of which the gluteus minimus is connected with the upper part of the capsule of the

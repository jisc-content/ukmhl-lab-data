180 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. the broad fibrous band by which its termination is attached to the left cms of the diaphragm; then to lay bare the inferior vena cava at the back of the foramen of Winslow, tie it, if there be blood in it, and divide it above the ligature. The next step is to tie the oesophagus at the entrance of the stomach, and divide it above the ligature, sever the peritoneal connections of the liver, divide the vena cava inferior immediately above it, and cut the branches of the coeliac axis, when the viscera to be removed will be completely separated from the body. The stomach and duodenum are to be washed and inflated, so as to show the form of the inflated stomach, the direction of its different muscular fibres and the thick ring of circular fibres at the pylorus [711]. They may then be slit open to exhibit the depression in which the bile duct and pancreatic duct terminate [718], the large and numerous valvulse conniventes and villi of the duodenum, the constriction of the mucous mem- brane at the pylorus, the thick spongy and smooth character of the gastric mucous membrane and the rugae into which it is thrown [713]. The spleen [753, 754] is to be examined in section, so as to show its pulp and trabecule; portions of its capsule are to be torn off, to show its strength and connections; and a part of the organ may be kneaded in water, so as to remove the pulp from its trabecular skeleton; and if after the pulp has been thoroughly removed the com- pressed structure from which it has been pressed be laid for a while in water, it will recover its original form, thus beautifully exhibiting the trabecule and demonstrating their elasticity.

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELYIS. 157 by which all the structures may be exhibited con- veniently on one side; and the intelligent dissector will be able, with the consent of his partner, to modify those directions so as to suit particular cir- cumstances. A mesial incision deviating to one side at the umbilicus is to be made from the lower end of the sternum to the pubes; and another incision, if not already made by the dissector of the arm, is to be carried transversely outwards from the upper end of this, as far as the border of the latissimus dorsi; while, if the skin is intact at the fold of the groin, a third may be directed inwards from the upper iliac spine. The integument is then to be removed from the lower or inguinal portion of the abdominal wall, situated below the last incision, and it is preferable that arrangement be made with the dissector of the lower limb to raise in one flap continuous with it the integument of the upper part of the thigh and so avoid an incision along the fold of the groin. In the subcutaneous tissue underneath will be found two sets of branches [459] of the femoral artery with corre- sponding tributaries of the internal saphenous vein [486], viz., the superficial circumflex iliac vessels directed upwards and outwards, and the superficial epigastric directed upwards and inwards. These vessels course superficial to an important membranous layer of the superficial fascia, distinguished as Scarpa's fascia [382]. This is to be brought into view by cutting down on the subjacent aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle at the level of the transverse cutaneous incision, and raising the fascia from the aponeurosis

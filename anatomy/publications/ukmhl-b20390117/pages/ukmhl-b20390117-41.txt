DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 33 the wrist are disposed in pairs, those for the third and fourth fingers being in front of the other two. On raising this muscle for its complete dissection, without dividing it, there maybe obtained a complete view of the median nerve [520] from the elbow to the wrist, giving branches to the superficial flexors, with the exception of the flexor carpi ulnaris ; and also in the upper part of the forearm the origin of its deep branch, the anterior interosseous, will be seen. The course of the ulnar artery [440] as far as the hand will now also be completely exhibited. It will be found giving off at the upper part the anterior and posterior ulnar recurrent branches, which pass respec- tively in front of and behind the inner epicondyle of the humerus to anastomose with the anastomotic and inferior profunda, and immediately afterwards the interosseous artery, which at once divides into anterior and posterior interosseous, the latter piercing between the bones to the back of the forearm. At the wrist will be seen the origins of the anterior and posterior carpal branches of the ulnar artery. In contact with the artery on its inner side in the lower half of the forearm is the ulnar nerve [517], and this is to be traced up to the part already exposed behind the inner epicondyle of the humerus ; and its branches to the flexor carpi ulnaris and inner half of the flexor digitorum profundus should be seen. The deep muscles can now be displayed without division of the superficial group, or by dividing, at most, the radial origin of the flexor digitorum sub- limis. Two of the deep muscles are longitudinal, namely, the flexor pollicis longus to the outside, and c

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 195 to be each doubled on itself; and they are to be cut into, to show the reticular character of their mucous membrane. On continuing the dissection down to the prostate, the junction of vas deferens and the duct of the vesicula seminalis to form the ejaculatory duct will be brought into view [778]; and a deep mesial part of the prostate between the neck of the bladder and the entrance of the ejaculatory ducts, separated by the latter from the main mass of the gland projecting over them on the rectal aspect, will be distinguished, which is the middle lobe [778] of the prostate. It may be well to divide the penis about the middle, to note the appearance of the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum on transverse section, and the section of the artery in each corpus cavernosum, then to slit the urethra in the distal portion from beneath, so as to show the dilatation of the urethra called fossa navicularis [782] immediately inside the orifice. The remaining portion of the urethra is to be slit open from above by a cut carried close to one side of the septum of the corpora cavernosa, so as to lay bare the septum [780], then continued in a straight line on through the mem- branous and prostatic portions of the urethra and the front of the bladder. The recesses in the spongy part of the urethra, as well as the appearance of the mucous membrane, are to be noted; also the dilata- tion in the bulb and the thickening of the corpus spongiosum at that part [782]. In the prostatic part [781] are to be noted the flat and wide form of the urethra in the middle of the prostate, and the con- striction at the neck of the bladder; also in the

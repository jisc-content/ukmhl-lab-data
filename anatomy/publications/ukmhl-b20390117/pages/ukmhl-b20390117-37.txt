DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 29 been removed from the front of the arm, the biceps muscle extending from scapula to forearm may be first dissected out. On its inner side above will be found the coraco-brachialis [263] descending with the short head of the biceps from the coracoid process, and pierced by the musculo-cutaneous nerve. This nerve may be at once followed down, and its muscular branches may be exhibited [517]; namely, that to the coraco-brachialis, given off as it pierces it, and branches to the biceps and brachialis anticus as it passes down between them to become superficial by the outer side of the tendon of the former. The aponeurotic part of the insertion (semilunar fascia) of the biceps [263], extending inwards between the brachial artery and median basilic vein, and important in connection with venesection, is to be specially noted. The brachial artery [437], with the median nerve [520] in front of it, and with its venae comites joined by the basilic [485], and ending in the axil- lary vein, may now be dissected out. At its com- mencement will be seen the superior profunda branch accompanying the musculo-spiral nerve as it passes backwards into the musculo-spiral groove; a little lower down is the inferior profunda branch accom- panying the ulnar nerve [517] down to the interval between the olecranon and the inner epicondyle of the humerus, where both become concealed by the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle; and a little above the elbow the anastomotic branch will be seen extending inwards on the brachialis anticus. Also various mus- cular twigs are to be noted, and the nutrient branch entering the humerus near the level of the insertion

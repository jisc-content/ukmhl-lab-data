DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK, 97 its back, and afterwards the clavicle should be either divided or disarticulated. The shoulders of the subject having been raised on a block, the head should be allowed to hang back over the end of the table, with the face inclined away from the side to be dissected. A mesial incision may be made from the sternum to the chin, and another outwards along the clavicle to the acromion to join the incisions already made from behind, care being taken not to injure the muscular fibres of the thin subcutaneous sheet of muscle, the platysma myoides [328], and the branches of cutaneous nerves descend- ing over the clavicle. Reflect the skin towards the face, and at the same time display underneath it the platysma myoides muscle; then let this also be re- flected upwards, and dissect the trunks of the super- ficial veins and nerves. The principal superficial veins are the anterior and external jugular veins [471, 472], and they present varieties in different subjects ; but the anterior is distinguished by dipping down to the deep structures in front of the sterno-mastoid muscle, while the external jugular dips down behind that muscle. The nerves to be sought are the superficial branches of the cervical plexus, and radiate from the middle of the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle; the small occipital [511] ascends along the posterior border of the muscle; the great auricular [512] is directed towards the interval between the ear and the jaw; the superficial cervical [512] turns directly forwards before dividing over the anterior triangle or part of the neck in front of the sterno- mastoid muscle; and the descending branches are Gr

156 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. placed not far off from the deep incision in lithotomy and might be injured if arising unusually far back, or more probably by an improper extension of the deep incision too far forwards. Under cover of the mesial attachment of the deep transverse muscles is a pair of small bodies, Cowper's glands [783], the slender ducts of which, in a favourable subject, may be traced for- wards. On the left side, the pudic artery [454] and nerve [531] may now be dissected out as far as is possible in the present dissection, when the origins of the branches already exhibited will be brought into view, as well as the artery to the corpus cavernosum [454]. The anterior edge of the levator ani muscle [388], which passes directly forwards on the deep surface of the deep layer of subpubic fascia and supports the prostate, is now to be dissected out on both sides; and if the attachment of the superficial sphincter to the central point of the perinseum [388] be divided, and the rectum pushed back with the handle of the scalpel, a most instructive view of the prostate gland [778] and lowest part of the bladder, as seen when separated from the rectum, may be obtained. 2. The Abdominal Wall.â€”This dissection may be begun as soon as the subject is laid on its back. It will sometimes be found expedient to make on one side a continuous dissection of the flat muscles throughout their whole extent, and to reserve the lower part of the abdominal wall on the other side for a special examination of the parts through which inguinal hernia may take its course; but in the directions about to be given a plan is recommended

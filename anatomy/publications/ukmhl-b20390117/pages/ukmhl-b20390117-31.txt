DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. 23 the internal anterior thoracic, the nerve of Wrisberg, the internal cutaneous, the ulnar, and the inner head of the median nerve; the posterior cord (behind the vessels) giving off the three subscapular, the circum- flex, and the musculo-spiral. The long or second sub- scapular nerve has already been dissected out, the third or lowest is now seen passing to the subscapular muscle and the teres major, while the first or short subscapular, situated deeper in the axilla, ends altogether in the subscapular muscle, and will be better seen after removal of the limb [521]. A day should be arranged with the dissector of the neck for interfering with the clavicle. The sterno- clavicular articulation [150] is then to be studied by dissecting out the inter-clavicular and costoclavicular ligaments, and dividing the anterior ligament suffi- ciently to expose the interior of the joint and the inter- articular fibro-cartilage. The limb is then to be moved about so as to exhibit the relations of the articular surfaces one to another in different positions of the limb, and the tension or relaxation of the various ligamentous structures in those positions, while the posterior ligament, which is closely connected with the costoclavicular, remains untouched. The clavicle may then be sawn across, or, in the event of the dissection of the neck being sufficiently advanced, and it being deemed advisable, it may be disarticulated from the sternum. The continuity of all vessels and nerves passing from the neck to the limb, including the supra- scapular artery [431] and nerve [516], is now to be studied in conjunction, if possible, with the dissector of the neck, and those structures are then to be

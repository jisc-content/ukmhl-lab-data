94 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. and on the under surface of the velum interpositum the choroid plexuses of the third ventricle [620]. In the third ventricle attention is to be paid to the con- nection of the pineal body with the rest of the brain by a folded white lamina called the posterior white commissure [610], and to the pair of peduncles of the pineal gland lying on the edges where the white upper surfaces of the optic thalami meet their ver- tical inner surfaces, which, as well as the whole floor of the third ventricle, are of grey matter. The anterior ivhite commissure is seen in the fore part of the ventricle crossing in front of the anterior crura of the fornix, while the middle or soft commissure unites the optic thalami, but is sometimes absent. The anterior ex- tremity of the aqueduct of Sylvius or iter a tertio ad quartum ventriadum [609] will be recognised below the posterior white commissure. Between the cor- pora quadrigemina and optic thalamus, on each side, the little elevations called outer and inner corpora geniculata [612], in connection with the optic tract, are to be noted ; and between the corpora quadri- gemina and cerebellum the valve of Vieussens or anterior velum [602], with the superior peduncles of the cerebellum or processus a cerebello ad testes on the sides of it, and the fourth pair of nerves arising from its fore part. At this stage it is advisable, if the base have been previously examined, to divide the isthmus cerebri, separating the cerebrum from the posterior parts of the encephalon by a cut passing through the valve of Vieussens above and the crura cerebri below. In the section the substantia nigra [613] will be seen. The

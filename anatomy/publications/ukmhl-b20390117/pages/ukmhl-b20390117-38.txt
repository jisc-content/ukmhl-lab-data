30 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. of the coraco-brachialis.1 The aponeurosis is to be removed from the back of the arm and the single muscle occupying that region, the triceps extensor brachii [265], is to be dissected. Its long and its outer head of origin are to be raised from the musculo- spiral groove by the separation of their fibres from those continuous with the inner or short head; and a good dissector can manage this without division of the muscle, so as to lay bare the whole course of the musculo-spiral groove, and show the complete distinct- ness of the outer and long heads from the deep part of the muscle. If the aponeurosis be now removed from a small portion of the back of the forearm, between the olecranon and external epicondyle of the humerus, the anconeus muscle [267] will be laid bare, and its continuity with the horizontal lowest fibres of the triceps demonstrated. Its nerve [522], given off from the musculo-spiral high up in the musculo-spiral groove, should also be traced down to it through the deep fibres of the triceps. When this has been done 1 The artery of the upper limb is so subject to variations that it is right to attract the dissector's attention to those which he is most liable to meet with. The median nerve may be behind the vessel, and the subscapular, the two circumflex, and the two profunda arteries may all arise together from a common trunk. Frequently the brachial artery divides at a high level (or the division may even take place in the axilla), and the artery prematurely separated may be the radial; or the usually situated trunk may furnish the radial and the interosseous of the forearm, while the abnormal high branch is termed ulnar ; or lastly, the interosseous alone may be given off high. Also a vas aberrans may arise above from the otherwise normal trunk and join one of the arteries of the forearm below [438].

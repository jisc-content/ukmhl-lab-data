DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 153 of skin turned outwards. The dissector can then satisf}^ himself that on each side of the anus there is a hollow filled with fat, the ischio-rectal fossa [395], while in front there is a firm boundary of fascia and other structures. A cut from before backwards being made down into the middle of the right fossa, it will be seen that a superficial pad of fat is separated from a deeper layer, and that in the plane of separation are the inferior hcemorrhoidal artery [454], vein, and branch [532] of the pudic nerve, on their way to the surface. After finding and following these structures, the student should exhibit the walls of the fossa, namely, on the outside the obturator fascia [393], the margin of the gluteus maximus muscle [288] behind, and internally the levator ani [388] and coccygeus [389] muscles covered by the anal fascia [395]. The pudic artery [454] with its accompanying veins and branches of the pudic nerve [532] passes forwards in the outer wall of the fossa in the substance of the obturator fascia. Emerging between the levator ani and coccy- geus muscles, a small branch from the fourth sacral nerve [536] will be found coming to the surface. In front, the dissector should be satisfied, at this stage of the dissection, with feeling the position of the staff in the membranous portion of the urethra, and should beware of injuring the fasciae. This dissection should be repeated on the left side of the body; and in doing this the dissector will do well first to divide the fat filling the fossa as it would be divided in the lateral operation of lithotomy, and to note the depth to which such an incision might be carried, and feel the position of the groove of the staff between the

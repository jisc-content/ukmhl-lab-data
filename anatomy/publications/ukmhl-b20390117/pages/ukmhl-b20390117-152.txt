142 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. filaments joining them from the thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic nerve to form the posterior pulmonary plexus [557], are to be brought into view. Pursuing the dissection in a forward direction, the constituents of the root of the lung [747] are to be made plain ; namely, from above downwards, left pulmonary artery, left bronchus and left pulmonary veins, and along with these the left bronchial [446, 752] arteries given off from the aorta, and left bronchial vein [480] opening usually into the superior intercostal. Then, continuing the dissection backwards, the pleura is to be stripped from the aorta and from the back part of the thoracic wall, and the sympathetic ganglionic chain [564] lying on the necks of the ribs is to be dissected out, together with the great splanchnic nerve arising by separate origins from different ganglia from about the fifth to about the ninth. The condition of the dissec- tion of the abdomen will probably not allow the sympathetic nerves to be displayed in the lower part hid by the convexity of the diaphragm till a later period. The courses of the sympathetic branches to the lung are to be followed from the ganglia; and the double connection of each ganglion with the corresponding spinal nerve should also be shown. The fat and connective tissue should be cleared away from the back part of the intercostal spaces, so as to show the intercostal nerves and arteries lying on the deep surface of the external intercostal muscles, and the posterior margins of the internal intercostals [366] at some distance from the vertebrae. Also the arrangement of the intercostal veins is to be pre- served, the lower veins followed into the left vena

194 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 10. The Pelvic Viscera.â€”The viscera are to be removed by dividing the attachments of the corpora cavernosa, the structures attaching the urethra be- neath the symphysis, and the levator ani, coccygeus and coccygeal attachment of the superficial sphincter ani. The relation of the rectum [727] to the prostate and bladder in the male, and to the vagina in the female, is to be examined, and the rectum is then to be dissected separate from the other organs. The accumulation of circular fibres forming the deep sphincter ani [728] is to be shown, the rectum is to be slit open, so as to display the appearance of its mucous membrane, and the slight transverse plica- tions sometimes called folds of Houston, and, lastly, the region grasped by the sphincter, especially the crenated line of termination of the intestinal mucous membrane must receive attention [728]. The ureters [767] are to be followed down to their points of entrance into the bladder, and the arrangement of the muscular fibres of the bladder [770] is to be examined. This will be seen to be highly complex; and the most striking points are a superficial strip of vertical fibres in front and behind, spreading out above, and fibres circling with all degrees of obliquity. At the upper end is the urachus [768]. In the male the prostate [778] and copious prostatic plexus of veins [779], and the membranous part of the urethra [782] are to be cleared, and the vasa deferentia [776] and vesiculce seminales [777] are to be dissected out. The vesiculae seminales will be seen

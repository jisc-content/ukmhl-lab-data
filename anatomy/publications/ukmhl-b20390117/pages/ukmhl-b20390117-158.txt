148 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. competency of the arterial valves, both aortic and pulmonary, may be tested by pouring water into the vessels; and the three dilatations, or sinuses of Valsalva, opposite the three pouches of the valve in each artery, may be examined. The auricles may then be removed, note being taken of the complete absence of continuity of their muscular fibres with those of the ventricles. The auriculo-ventricular openings will then be seen lying side by side, with the aortic orifice between and in front of them, and the orifice of the pulmonary artery in front of the aortic [Fig. 310]. In the angle between the aorta and the two auriculo-ventricular openings will be found a small nodule of cartilage, with fibres extending from it. Lastly, the aortic orifice and that of the pulmonary artery are to be slit open between two of the adjacent sinuses of Valsalva, so as to show the three pouches of which each semilunar valve consists, each with thin lunulce at the sides, and a stronger part in the centre coming to a thickened point close to the margin, called corpus Arantii [403]. Also, in two of the aortic sinuses of Valsalva the origins of the coronary arteries will be seen, above the level of the segments of the valve. 4. The Air Tubes and Interior of the Lungs.â€” The ease with which the pleura can be stripped from the surface of the lungs should be tested, and in favourable circumstances it will not be hard to see the veins of this membrane running backwards in it, and twigs of bronchial arteries supplying it. The lungs are to be removed by dividing the trachea; and the bronchi are to be dissected out [751]. The greater

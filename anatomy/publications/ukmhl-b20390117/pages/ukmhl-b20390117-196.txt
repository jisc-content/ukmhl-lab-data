186 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. obturator, which passes over the pubic bone, and terminates in the pectineus muscle. The psoas magnus muscle is to be detached from its origins, so as to exhibit its separate origins from bodies and transverse processes of vertebras and to lay bare the lumbar plexus from which the nerves already- seen arise [524]. The plexus is formed from the anterior divisions of the first four lumbar nerves. The ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal are branches from the first lumbar; the genito-crural springs from the first and second; the external cutaneous is derived from the second and third nerves; and the anterior crural and obturator take origin by roots from the second, third and fourth. A trunk formed by the fifth lumbar nerve joined by a communicating branch of the fourth, is called the lumbosacral cord [530, 531], and enters the pelvis. Internal to the psoas muscle the lumbar part of the sympathetic chain [565] rests on the bodies of the vertebras; and in the groove of each vertebral body long communicating branches pass between each lumbar nerve and the corresponding sympathetic ganglion. There are usually two such branches connected with each nerve, but this is liable to variation. Turning now to the region of the quadratus lumborum muscle, the student will dissect the deep surface of the remains of the transversalis muscle [378], and will observe that it sends in a thin aponeurosis in front of the quadratus lumborum [365]; and on dividing this, and turning inwards the outer edge of the quadratus, he will see the strong attachment of the posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis to the transverse processes; and,

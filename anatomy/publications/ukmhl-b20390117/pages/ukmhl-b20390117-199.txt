DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 189 the male. By separating the cms clitoridis and bulbus vestibuli, the triangular ligament [395] already mentioned will be brought into view; and in young subjects the glands of Bartholin [792] (corresponding to Cowper's glands in the male) will be found at the back of the vulva sending their ducts forwards to open at the side of the hymen [791] or of the carunculae myrtiformes left in the situation which the hymen had occupied. The peritoneum is to be stripped from the walls of the pelvis, when attention will be given to the pelvic fascia descending on the sides and in front from near the brim [392]. This will be seen to be firmly con- nected below with the sides of the bladder, forming its lateral true ligaments, and to be continued in front into a couple of short bands with a slight fossa between, the anterior true ligaments [393, 394]. At the back of the pelvic cavity the stripping down of the peritoneum will lay bare the division of the hypogastric plexus [567] to form the two pelvic plexuses for the supply of the pelvic viscera, and the internal iliac vessels [452, 481] with their visceral branches gathered so as to form, with the fascia between them, a sheet directed forwards and having the obliterated hypo- gastric artery [453] at its upper edge. A dissection must now be made for the more complete display of the fasciae of the pelvis; and for this purpose, if the walls of the ischio-rectal fossa or the obturator fascia have been damaged on either side in the dissection of the perinaeum, the opposite side should be chosen. Much the neatest plan of making this dissection is to arrange it so that not

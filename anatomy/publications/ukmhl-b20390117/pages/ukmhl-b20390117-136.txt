126 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. nerves should be dissected out, and the pharyngeal branch [556] of the vagus should be traced from its •origin to its destination. The remaining portion of the temporal bone bounding the jugular fossa should be separated and carefully raised, search being made to find the auricular branch of the vagus (Arnold's) •entering the bone [556]; and the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (Jacobson,s) is to be seen •entering the spiculum between the jugular fossa and carotid canal [554]. The carotid canal should next be laid open, so as to enable the part of the bone external to it to be •everted and expose completely in the foramen lacerum posticum the passage of the nerves out of the cranium, the connection of the vagus and spinal-accessory, the petrous and jugular ganglia of the glossopharyngeal, and the ganglia of the root and trunk of the vagus. The uppermost ganglion of the sympathetic can now be fully dissected out [562]. Its connections upwards should be traced along the internal carotid artery into the carotid and cavernous plexus, also its communications with the four upper cervical nerves, and its cardiac branch [563]. Its pharyngeal branches uniting by the side of the middle constrictor with branches from the pneumogastric and glosso-pharyngeal to form the pharyngeal plexus should next be noted [554]. Tracing the sympathetic cord downwards, its middle [563] and lower cervical ganglia [564] in the lower part of the neck, and their connection respectively with the fifth and sixth and with the seventh and eighth spinal nerves, are to be shown, as also their cardiac branches.

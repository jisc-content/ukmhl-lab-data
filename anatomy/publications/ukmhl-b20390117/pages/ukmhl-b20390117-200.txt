190 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. only the arch of the pubes and ischial attachments of the obturator fascia shall be left uninjured, but likewise the brim of the pelvis; and this can always be managed with a little care by means of a single section with the saw, carried close by the brim of the pelvis, in such a direction as to remove a great part of the thickness of the ischial tuberosity and pass as near as possible to the sacro-sciatic notches without breaking into them. By this means the hip-joint can be removed intact, and an opportunity will be gained of opening into the acetabulum without injury to the capsule of the joint, and thus studying the action of the ligamentum teres [189]. The opening in the pelvic wall is to be enlarged with the bone- nippers as far as is possible without injury to any fascia, and the obturator internus muscle is to be removed from its position, and the peculiar divided arrangement of its tendon may be looked at before it is thrown aside [290]. A view will then be obtained of the obturator fascia [394], attached above to a white line seen extending from the spine of the ischium to the back of the pubes, and below to an arch formed by bone, except at the back part, where it passes internal to the small sciatic notch, and is attached to the sacro-sciatic ligaments. Also, above the white line is seen the undivided pelvic fascia [393], with the obturator vessels and nerves piercing it in front. It is continued below the white line into the recto-vesical fascia [393] on the upper surface of the levator ani muscle. The inaccuracy of those descriptions which describe the obturator and pelvic fasciae as one con- tinuous structure can now be easily demonstrated by

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 197 11. The Ligaments of the Pelvis.â€”Eeturning to the walls of the pelvis, the student has to examine the concentrically laminated structure of the sym- physis pubis [185], the greater and lesser sacro-sciatic ligaments [185], and the ilio-lumbar and lumbosacral ligaments [184] extending to the ilium and sacrum from the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra. The sacro-iliac articulation is then to be examined [184]. Its ventral ligament [184], situated below the joint in the erect posture of the body, is little more than periosteum, but is continuous pos- teriorly with the usually misunderstood terminal liga- ment [185]. The dorsal sacro-iliac ligament [185] is of great strength to bear the weight of the trunk, and cannot be fully seen without dividing the ventral ligament and laying open the joint. The clothing of the articular surfaces with cartilage is liable to fibrous adhesions, but in all cases it consists originally of two distinct layers of articular cartilage. The action of the pelvic ligaments, however, cannot be studied except in a pelvis which is quite uninjured. The articulations of the lumbar vertebrae one with another should be examined, and for this purpose their laminae and the back of the sacral canal should be removed now, if they have not been previously taken away for the dissection of the spinal cord. The ligamenta subflava [123] will then be noted, and the capsules of the joints between the articular processes; also the lower parts of the anterior and posterior common ligaments [123]. But what is most important to dissect in this part of the vertebral column is the arrangement of the intervertebral discs [123], which

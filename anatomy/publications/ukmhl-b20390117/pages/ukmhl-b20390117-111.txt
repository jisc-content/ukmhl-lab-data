DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 101 gives off, as it passes across the space, its submental branch; but the deep part of the gland, passing beneath the border of the mylo-hyoid muscle, may be left undisturbed at present. Also disappearing beneath the border of the mylo-hyoid muscle, not far from the hyoid bone, is the trunk of the hypoglossal nerve [559]; and by following it backwards a little way, there will be reached its branch to the thyro- hyoid muscle, and about half an inch further back the descending branch [560], which is to be completely dissected out to its distribution, and to have its con- nections with the cervical plexus followed up. The thyro-hyoid muscle can be dissected out by raising the sternohyoid from its surface without dividing it, and close to the thyroidal attachment of the sterno-thyroid muscle the external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve [556] is to be found, and it should be followed to its destination in the crico-thyroid muscle. This muscle and its fellow, together with the crico- thyroid ligament which they partially cover, as also a small twig of the superior thyroid artery directed across the ligament and capable of giving trouble in laryngotomy, may be studied at once [742]. The sheath of the common carotid artery [413] and internal jugular vein, where those vessels are crossed by the upper border of the anterior belly of the omo- hyoid muscle, should now be opened, the position of the artery, vein and pneumo gastric nerve noted, and the artery followed up so as to display the external and internal carotid arteries as far as the stage of the dissection permits. The veins will be followed at the same time, and the communication between the

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 193 will dissect the superior gluteal nerve [531], which emerges with the gluteal artery, and trace it to its origin from the lumbo-sacral cord. He will then follow the pudic nerve [531] from its origin to its distribution, and will complete the superficial dis- section of the penis by the complete removal of the integument; displaying the dorsal arteries [454] and nerves [532], and following the dorsal vein [482] back through the triangular ligament. He may now lay completely bare the fibrous exterior of the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum, and he should dissect the glans sufficiently from the extremities of the corpora cavernosa to show that it is distinct from them [779-781]. The remainder of the ischium and descending ramus of the os pubis may be removed, and the viscera withdrawn from their natural position, so as to allow the origin of the pyriformis muscle [290] and also the fourth and fifth sacral nerves and the coccygeal nerve to be dissected out on the sacrum [536]. The dissection of the sympathetic chain is to be continued down from the point where it was left off in the lumbar region, and its ganglia and communications are to be traced down to the ganglion impar [565] in front of the coccyx. Below this in the middle line, a lobulatecl structure, the size of a lentil, may be found, the so-called coccygeal gland [759]. Turning the viscera still more outwards, a dissection may be made of the coccygeus and levator ani muscles from above, so as to exhibit them as a muscular floor to the pelvis, justifying the term pelvic diaphragm sometimes used [388].

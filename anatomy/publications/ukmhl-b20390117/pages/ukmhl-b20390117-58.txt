50 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. [531] descends along the middle of the space, and is generally easily found, as it closely accompanies a large tributary of the saphenous vein, which is simi- larly placed. The fascia may be reflected, and then the space is to be cleared by dissecting out the boun- daries and afterwards laying bare the large vessels and nerves; by which means the fat will be thrown into large isolated masses which can easily be removed. The space is bounded above by the biceps on the outside, and by the semimembranosus with the semi- tendinosus internal to it on the inside [292-294]; and is bounded below by the heads of the gastrocnemius muscle [311], with the small belly of the plantaris muscle [314] appearing from underneath the external head. The structures within the space to be brought into view at present may be shortly mentioned. The external popliteal nerve [535] lies close to the biceps muscle, and gives off some cutaneous branches, par- ticularly the peroneal communicating branch descending to the short saphenous nerve at the back of the leg; and it sends in two or three articular twigs to the outer part of the knee-joint. The internal popliteal nerve [533] descends in the middle of the space and detaches a tibial communicating branch for the formation of the short saphenous; it sends two or three articular twigs to the back and inner part of the joint, and at the lower part of the space gives off muscular branches to the gastrocnemius, plantaris, popliteus, and soleus muscles. The popliteal artery [461] and vein lie close together, the vein superficial and, except at the lower part, external to the artery; and, inasmuch as the pop-

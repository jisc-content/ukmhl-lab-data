164 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. be raised from their position; and if the handle of the scalpel be introduced between them and the spermatic cord, the dissector will see the thin mem- branous connective tissue named the cremasteric fascia [378]. There is now brought into view a continuous sheet of thin fascia, fascia transversalis [383], lying beneath the transversalis muscle, attached to Poupart's liga- ment, and stronger in the neighbourhood of that structure than in the upper and inner part of the dissection. The part of the spermatic cord laid bare by the reflection of the internal oblique and trans- versalis muscles is seen to emerge from a deep position by turning over a crescentic margin of aponeurotic fibres : the place of emergence is termed the internal or deep abdominal ring [384]. On examination the ring will be found not to present a perforation, but to have from its margins a thin membranous sheath prolonged down on the spermatic cord: this is the infundibidiform fascia [384], and although but a delicate and seemingly unimportant film, is worthy of the dissector's attention on account of its liability, like the other fasciae already mentioned, to undergo enormous thickening in cases of hernia. Beneath the transversalis fascia, between it and the peritoneum, is a layer of loose adipose tissue, the subperitoneal fat; also passing upwards and inwards beneath the spermatic cord, and internal and close to the margin of the deep abdominal ring, is the deep epigastric artery [456] with an accompanying vein, and curving upwards and outwards is the deep circumflex iliac artery [457].

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. 163 transverse direction and those below arching more and more downwards; while from the upper part of the lower third of Poupart's ligament in the male, other muscular fibres take origin, which turn down- wards on the surface of the spermatic cord, and constitute the main fasciculi of the cremaster muscle [378], represented in the female by a smaller group of muscular fibres somewhat detached from the rest of the internal oblique muscle. Passing the handle of the scalpel between the divided edge of the internal oblique and the still uninjured trans- versalis muscle, the student will now proceed to investigate the relations of the lower parts of these two muscles, one to the other. He will find them usually not very distinctly separated below; but the superficial branch of the deep circumflex iliac artery [457], directed upwards and outwards between them, will serve for a guide; and he will divide the fibres of the internal oblique close to Poupart's ligament, and turn them inwards. He will then observe that the fibres strictly belonging to the transversalis muscle cease at a somewhat higher level than those of the internal oblique, and that the lower fibres of both muscles are continued into an aponeurotic expansion, the conjoined tendon [379], which is directed downwards to the pubes, and blends at its insertion with the fascia transversalis, with Gimbernat's ligament, and with the inner part of Poupart's ligament. This will be seen to more advantage on dividing and reflecting inwards the lower part of the transversalis muscle in the same way as the internal oblique was divided. Also, the upper fibres of the cremaster muscle may

70 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. neus tertius have been traced to their insertions, and the extensor hallucis to the great toe, the tendons of the extensor digitorum longus to the four outer toes are to be dissected out; also the extensor digitorum brevis [323] arising from the fore part of the os calcis and passing obliquely forwards and inwards to the four inner toes; and the nerve to that muscle is to be found coming from the external division of the anterior tibial. The continuation of the anterior tibial artery, called dorsal artery of the foot [463, 464], is to be followed to its disappearance between the heads of origin of the first dorsal interosseous muscle; and its relation to the tendon of the extensor hallucis, which crosses it and lies on its inner side, is to be noted. Its tarsal and metatarsal branches are to be traced, with the three dorsal interosseous digital branches derived from the latter. Lastly, before it sinks into the sole, the dorsal artery of the foot detaches the first dorsal interosseous digital artery. The insertion of the lumbricales muscles into the expansions of the extensor tendons of the four outer toes should now be seen, and the mode of insertion of the middle part of each expansion into the second phalanx and of the lateral fibres into the last phalanx should be made out [310]. The peroneus longus and brevis muscles are now to be dissected [306]. Their nerves will be found given off from the musculo-cutaneous ; and the division of the external popliteal trunk into the musculo-cutaneous and anterior tibial nerves will be found in close con- nection with the origin of the peroneus longus [535]. The peroneus brevis will be followed behind the

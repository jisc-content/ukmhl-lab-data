36 DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND UPPER LIMB. two outer lumbricales muscles and the short muscles of the thumb, with the exception of the adductor and inner head of the flexor brevis; while the ulnar nerve supplies branches to the muscles of : the little finger, and sends down a deep branch along with the deep branch of the ulnar artery, to supply the two inner lumbricales, the interossei, the adductor pollicis, and the inner half of the flexor pollicis brevis. The anterior annular ligament [160, 286] of the wrist should be examined and divided ; the large and surgically important bursas [275] lubricating the ten- dons beneath it should be observed, and the tendons should be separated and followed to their insertions. The flexor carpi radialis [271] will be traced into a special fibrous compartment, and on to its insertion into the second metacarpal bone. In raising the common flexors, the origins of the lumbricales muscles [274] from the flexor profundus will be brought into view, and their nerves must at this stage be traced into them; but the insertions of the lumbricales cannot be fully seen till the extensor digitorum is dissected. The sheaths on the fingers are to be cut open, and the disposition of the tendons, with the slender vincula [273] attached to their deep surface, is to be seen, as well as the extent of their thecse up into the palm. The short muscles of the thumb and little finger must next be examined [281-283]. The abductor pollicis is recognised by its parallel fibres and free edges as it passes down to the outer side of the first phalanx. The opponens pollicis is distinguished from the flexor brevis by its fibres being inserted into the

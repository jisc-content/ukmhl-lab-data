DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 73 extending laterally from it. The extent of the synovial membrane should be studied; the external or anterior crucial, and the posterior or internal crucial ligament should be shown, and their degree of ten- sion in different positions of the joint noted, particu- larly the tension of the internal crucial ligament and relaxation of the other ligaments of the joint in flexion, so as to allow rotation of the flexed leg. The loose parts of the walls of the joint should be removed so as to let the semilunar fibroplates be more fully seen, and the greater movement of the external fibroplate in flexion and extension of the joint; and to allow of a detailed inspection of the fibroplates, the lateral and crucial ligaments may be divided and the femur removed. The upper and lower tibio-fibular articulations are next to be studied, as well as the interosseous mem- brane [194]; and for this purpose the muscles are to be completely removed from the leg. The upper tibio-fibular joint presents an anterior and posterior ligament and a synovial membrane for study. The lower joint presents an anterior and posterior liga- ment and a long band, the transverse ligament, which deepens the concavity for the ankle-joint below the posterior ligament, and also an interosseous ligament which, however, cannot be seen till, at the end of the whole dissection, the bones are separated; the syno- vial cavity is a prolongation from the ankle-joint. The ankle-joint presents little which can be called an anterior or posterior ligament, although scattered fibres in its capsule are described by those names; but it has strong lateral ligaments, the internal one

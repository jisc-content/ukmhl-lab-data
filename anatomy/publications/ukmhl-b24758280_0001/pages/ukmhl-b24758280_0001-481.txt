(<?) The tliird ;perforating artery pierces the adductor magnus muscle, below the in- sertion of the adductor longus, and is distributed in a manner similar to the second perfor- ating artery. {(1) The fourth iierforating artery, the termination of the deep femoral artery, passing backwards close to the linea aspera, is distributed to the short head of the biceps and to the other hamstring mus- cles, and communicates with branches of the popliteal artery, and with the louver perforating arteries. Muscular branches.— In its course along the thigh, the femoral artery gives off several branches to the contiguous

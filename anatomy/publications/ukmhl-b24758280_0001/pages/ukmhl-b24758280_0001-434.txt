ARTERIES OF THE UPPER LIMB. A12 the annular ligament, are given off from the upper or concave side of the palmar arch. (c) The digital branches, usually four in number, proceed downwards from the convexity of the palmar arch to supply both sides of the three inner fingers, and the ulnar side of the fore finger. The first digital branch inclines inwards to the ulnar border of the hand, and, after giving minute offsets to the muscles of the little finger, runs along the inner margin of its phalanges. The second runs along the fourth metacarpal space, and at the root of the fingers divides into two branches, which proceed along the contiguous borders of the ring and little fingers. The third is similarly distributed to the ring and middle fingers ; and the fourth to the latter and the index fingers. The thumb and the radial side of the index finger are supplied fi'om the radial artery. Fig. 269.

The digital arteries are placed at first superficial to the tendons, and then they lie between them, accompanied by the digital nerves as far as the clefts of the fingers, where they are joined by the anterior interosseous arteries, branches of the deep arch. On the sides of the fingers, each artery lies beneath the corresponding nerve, and gives branches which supply the sheaths of the tendons and the joints, some of them anastomosing across the front of the bones with similar branches from the opposite side. At about the middle of the last phalanx, the two branches for each finger converge and form an arch.

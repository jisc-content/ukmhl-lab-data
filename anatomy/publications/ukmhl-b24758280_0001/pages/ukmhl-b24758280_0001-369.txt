Fig. 242, A. — The Aorta from before, with- the origins of its principal branches (R. Quain). J 1, the aorta at tlie place where it has been separated from the left ventricle, showing the semilunar valves in a closed condition, the sinuses of Valsalva, and the origin of the right and left coronary arte- ries ; 2, the ascending part of the arch, ^^■itIl the dilatation termed sinus ; 3, the third part of the arch ; 4, innomi- nate artery; 5, left carotid; 6, left subcla- vian ; 7, concavity of the middle part of the arch ; and farther down the aorta, 7, 7, indicate two out of the series of intercostal and lumbar arteries : the oesophageal arteries are also seen rising from the front of the thoracic aorta ; 8, 8, right and left renal arte- ries ; 9, 9, right and left common iliac arteries ; 10, middle sacral artery; 11, one of the inferior diaphragmatic arteries ; + , the coeliac axis ; 12, the gastric artery ; 13, the hepatic ; 14, the splenic; 15, superior mesenteric ; l6, inferior mesenteric ; 17, 17, right and left spermatic arte- ries. Fig. 242, B. — The SAME Aorta from BEHIND. (E. Quain). 4 The numbers have the same signification as in A. The origin of the right and left inter- costal arteries close to each other from near the middle line of the posterior wall of the aorta is shown. the vessel alters its course, and is directed upwards, backwards, and to the left side, then directly backwards, in contact with the trachea, to the left side of the body of the second dorsal vertebra. Arrived at that point,

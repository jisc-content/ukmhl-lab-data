ARTICULATIOXS OF THE TPPER LIMB. 156 The two rows of carpal bones are united by dorsal, palmar, and lateral ligaments. The lateral ligamejits are placed one at the radial, the other at the ulnar border of the carpus ; the former connects the scaphoid bone with the trapezium, the latter the cuneiform with the unciform. The dorsal ligainenfs consist of fibres passing in various directions ; the pahnar ligaments are chiefly composed of fibres converg- ing towards the os magnum. The bones of the first row, the pisiform bones excepted, are united by interosseous and by dorsal and palmar ligaments. The interosseous ligaments, placed on the sides of the semilunar bone on a level with its superior surface, connect it with the scaphoid and cunei- form bones, thus completing the inferior wall of the radio-carpal joint. The dorsal and jjalmar ligaments, each two in number, extend trans- versely on the dorsal and palmar surfaces from the scaphoid bone to the semilunar, and from the semilunar to the cuneiform. The bones of the second row are connected by similar means. The dorsal and palmar ligaments, each three in number, pass transversely between the contiguous bones. The interosseous ligaments are gene- rally three (but sometimes only two) in number, a strong hgament being placed between the os magnum and unciform bones, another between the trapezoid and trapezium, and a slender ligament between the OS magnum and trapezoid. A small interosseous ligament is also sometimes found between the os magnum and the scaphoid. (Fig. 142.) The synovial cavity of the carpal articulations is extensive and complicated. Passing between the two rows of carpal bones, it sends Fig. 142.â€”Transverse Section of the St- NoviAL Cavities op the Inferior Radio- ulnar, Radio-Carpal, Intercarpal, and Carpo-Metacarpal Articulations.

Note. It is to be observed that in this figure, and in others of a like kind which epresent the joint-cavities, the white or black lines indicating the synovial membranes are, for the sake of clearness, generally represented as passing over the surfaces of the articular cartilages, although this is not the case in nature. These lines therefore must be held to represent merely the whole continuity of the articular, or, as th.ey are often, called, the synovial surfaces.

139 OCCIPITO-YEETEBRAL ARTICULATIONS. The lateral or alar odontoid ligaments are two thick ancl very strong bundles of fibres, which extend from the sides of the summit of the odontoid process outwards and a little upwards to be implanted into the rough depression on the inner side of each condyle of the occipital bone, and Fig. 124. into a small part of the margin of the foramen magnum. Some of the fibres of the two ligaments are continuous across the middle line. Fig. 124.—Transverse Section similar to THAT represented IN PiG. 122, THE CRUCI- FORM Ligaments having been removed. (A.

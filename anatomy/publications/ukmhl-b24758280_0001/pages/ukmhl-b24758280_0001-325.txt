Relations.â€”The complexiis muscle is covered by the splenius, except at its lowest origins from the dorsal vertebrse and at the internal portion of its upper extremity ; the trachelo-mastoid and transversalis cervicis rest upon its series of origins, and the semispinalis colli, the posterior recti, and the obliqui capitis, together with the deep cervical artery, are concealed by it. The semispinalis muscle consists of fibres extending from trans- verse processes to spines, each bundle crossing over about five vertebras. It is described in two parts. a. The semispinalis colli is the part under cover of the complexus. It arises from the internal tubercles of the upper four or five dorsal transverse processes, and is inserted into the spines of the cervical vertebrae from the second to the fifth inclusive being thickest at its insertion into the second vertebra. The semisjmialis dorsi, not covered by the complexus, consists of narrow muscular bundles interposed between tendons of considerable length, and forms an elongated thin stratum, especially towards its lower border. It arises from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae from the tenth to the fifth inclusive, and is inserted into the spines of the last two cervical and first four dorsal vertebrse. The multifidus spin^ muscle reaches from the sacrum to the axis vertebra, passing up under cover of the semispinalis, and is much more largely developed towards the lower than at the upper end of the column. In the sacral region the fibres arise from the deep surface of the tendinous origin of the erector spinas, from the groove on the back of the sacrum as low as the fourth foramen, from the inner part of the posterior extremity of the iliac crest, and from the ligaments betv/een that bone and the sacrum ; in the lumbar region they take origin from the mammillary processes ; in the dorsal region from the transverse processes ; and in the neck from the articular processes of the four lower cervical vertebrae. From these several points the muscular bundles ascend obUquely, to be inserted into the lamina of the vertebrae, and into the spines from their bases nearly to their extremities. The fibres from each point of origin are fixed to several vertebras, some being inserted into the side of the spinous process next above, and others ascending more and more vertically as high as the fourth from the place of origin ; the longer fibres from one origin overlapping those from the origin next above. The rotatores spinss are eleven pairs of small muscles, which may be regarded as the deepest fibres of the multifidus spinas in the dorsal

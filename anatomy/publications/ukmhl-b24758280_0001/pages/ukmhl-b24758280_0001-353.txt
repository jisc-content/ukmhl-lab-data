S31 PERINEAL MUSCLES IN THE FEMALE. of the urethra : these are continuous behind with the circular fibres of the prostate, and are referred to in the description of that body. (See Structure of the Prostate.)

Varieties.—A 2^^'^J0-?{rethral muscle was describedby James Wilson (Medico- Chirurgical Trans.. London, vol. i. p. 176), and is sometimes referred to as Wilson's muscle, but has not been re- cognised as a separate mtiscle by suc- ceeding anatomists. An unstriped pudo-Tcsical band has been described, descending from the back of the symphysis to the neck of the bladder (Luschka). Nerves.—The muscles of the urethra and penis are supplied by the inferior ha3morrhoidal branch of the pudic nerve ; the levator and sphincter ani by the inferior hsemorrhoidal and by the fourth and fifth sacral and by the coccygeal nerves ; and the coccygeus muscle by the three last-named nerves. Actions.—The S2)Mncters of the anus cause by their contraction occlusion of that aperture. The contraction of the external is usually maintained involun- tarily, though it may be rendered firmer by an act of the will; that of the internal is wholly involuntary. The levator ani and coceygenft elevate the lower part of the rectum and invert its anal border, after the protrusion and eversion which accompany defecation. The transrersi acting together draw backwards and fix the central point of the perineum, thus assisting to give a base of support to the ejaculator muscle. The erector i)enis serves to compress the cms penis and thus assist in producing or at least in maintaining the erection of the penis. The ejaculator uriiuc compresses the bulb and the adjoining part of the corpus spongiosum of the urethra, so as to eject forcibly any fluid lodged in the canal. It comes into action near the end of the process of micturition, when its con- traction is mainly a voluntary act, and in the emission of the semen when it is involuntary. The constrictor urethroi and the circular involuntary muscles diminish the calibre of the urethra and expel its contents ; their fibres contract near the end of micturition, so as to assist the ejaculator in clearing the canal. B.—In the FEMALE. — In the female the anterior fibres of the levator ani embrace the vagina as they do the prostate in the male. The transversus perin^i and the spliincter ani are arranged nearly in the same manner as in the male. The erector clitoridis differs from the erector penis of the male by its smaller size alone. The sphincter vaginae is attached behind to the central point of the perina3um, in common with the sphincter ani and transversus perinsei muscles ; its fibres open out to surround the vaginal orifice and vesti- bule, closely embracing on the outer side the two bulbs of the vesti-

164 ARTICULATIONS OF THE LOWER LIMB. Fig. 148. Fig. 148â€”Transverse Oblique Section of the Pelvis and Hip-Joint, cuTTiNa the FIRST Sacral Vertebra and the Symphysis Pubis in their middle, from a Male Subject op about nineteen years op age. (A. T.) ^ 1, the first sacral vertebra ; 2, tlie divided ilium ; 3, tlie posterior sacro-iliac liga- ments ; 4, 4, the sacro-iliac synchondrosis, with a slight separation between the two plates of cartilage ; 5, the ajiterior sacro-iliac ligament; 6, the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament; 7, greater sacro-sciatic ligament ; 8, placed in front of the symphysis pubis, in the cut surface of which the small median cavity, the adjacent fibro-cartilaginous plates, and the anterior and posterior ligamentous fibres are shown ; 9, the lower part of the obturator membrane ; 10, the cartilaginous suiface of the cotyloid cavity, through the middle of which the incision passes transversely, dividing the round ligament and the synovial fat of the depression ; 11, the cotyloid ligament ; 12, the round ligament con- nected with the transverse part of the cotyloid ligament ; 13, placed on the cut surface of the head of the left femur near the depression where the round ligament is attached ; 14, 14', the upper and lower x^arts of the capsular ligament and synovial capsule. The cotyloid ligament forms a thick fibro-cartilaginous ring round the margin of the acetabulum, increasing the depth of its cavity, and bridging over the deficiency in its border. Its external surface is in contact with the capsular ligament, the internal closely embraces the head of the femur, and both are covered by the synovial membrane. Its fibres do not run parallel to the circumference of the cotyloid cavity, but pass obliquely from without inwards over its margin, one extremity being attached to the outer, the other to the inner surface. At the cotyloid notch the fibres of the ligament are continued from

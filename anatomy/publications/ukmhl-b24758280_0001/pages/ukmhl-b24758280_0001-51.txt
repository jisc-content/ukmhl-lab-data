C, and E, are reduced below the size of nature. a single centre in the presternum, ~ The next centre appears at the seventh month in the upper segment of the mesosternum. and ossilication follows in the next two segments shortly before birth. In the lower segments, ossification begins in the first year or later, and in the metasternum not before the sixth year, and often much later. In the prestermim occasionally two centres of ossi- fication appear, one above the other. In the upper segment of the mesosternum the centre is most commonly single, but in each of the following segments there are frequently two placed one on each side of the middle line. The lower seg- ments of the mesosternum unite together after puberty, but the upper one often remains separate till after the twenty-fifth year. Tlie metasternum is united to the mesosternum in middle life, the presternum in more advanced life. The bony parts formed from the lateral centres of the lower segments of the meso- sternum, as well as of the metasternum. not unfrequently remain separate for a considerable time, and occasionally, by defect of ossification or non-union across the middle line, have a permanent median aperture in the bone—the so-called foramen stcrnale. The metasternum is sometimes bifid, and in rare cases the mesosternum has been found divided to a greater or less extent from below upwards, constituting the malformation of fissura sterni, and connected in some instances with ectopia cordis. (See the case of E. Groux, described by Allen Thomson in the Glasgow Med. Journal, 1858.) III.—THE BOI^"ES OF THE HEAD. The skull, comprising the bones of the head, is of a spheroidal figure, compressed on the sides, broader behind than before, and sup]:)orted on the vertebral cohimn. All its bones, with the exception of the lower jaw, are ahnost immovably united together by lines and narrow surfaces, more or less uneven, termed sutures. The skull is divided by anatomists into two parts, the cranium aud the face. The cranium protects the brain ; the face surrounds the mouth and nasal passages, and completes witli the cranium the orbits or cavities for the eyes. The cranium is composed of eight bones, viz.: the occipital, t\YO 2^ciristal, the frontal, two temporal, the spJienoid, and the ethmoid. The face is com- posed of fourteen bones, of which twelve are in pairs, viz. : the superior ymxillarij, malar, nasal, 'jMlate, lachrymal, and inferior turVrnated lanes; and two single, viz., the vomer, and the inferior maxUla. There is also suspended by ligaments from the under surface of the cranium, the hyoid bone, which may be classed with the bones of the head. THE OCCIPITAL BONE The occipital bone is situated at the lower and back part of the cranium. In general form it is rhomboidal, and through its lower and anterior part passes a lai-ge oval foramen, forming the communication between the cranium and spinal canal. The portion of the bone behind the foramen is tahular, the narrower part in front forms a thick mass named Msilar ^process, and the parts on the sides of the foramci], bearing

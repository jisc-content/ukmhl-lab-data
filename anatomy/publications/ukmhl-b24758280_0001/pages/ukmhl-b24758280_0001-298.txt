MUSCLES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 276 nerve. A synovial sheath lines the contiguous surfaces of the tendon and pulley. lielatums.—Tliis muscle is covered by the roof of the orbit, the fourth nerve entering- its upper sui-face ; and beneath it lie the nasal nerve and the internal rectus muscle. ri-. 205.

The inferior olsli^iie is the only muscle of the eye which does not take orig-in at the apex of the orbit. It arises from a minute de- pression in the orbital plate of the superior maxillary bone, just within the anterior margin of the orbit, and close to the external border of the lachrymal groove. The muscle inclines outwards and backwards between the inferior rectus and the floor of the orbit, and ends in a tendinous expansion, which passes between the external rectus and the eyeball, to be inserted on the external and posterior aspect of the globe. Varieties.—The levator palpebrse sometimes gives off a slip from its inner border, which passes to be inserted into the trochlea, forming- the te/i.sor trocldcre of Budge. A slip of a similar nature was described by Albinus as a case of doubling of the levator palpebrjB, and by MoUinetti as a fifth rectus. The levator palpebrjB has been seen entirely wanting (Macalister). The rectus externus may have its two heads separate to their insertion, thus forming a double rectus (Albinus). Macalister has twice noted the absence of the outer head. The tramvcrsns crhifis (Bochdalek) consists of an arching slip of muscular fibres passing from the anterior and superior portion of the os planum across the upper surface of the eyeball to the outer w^all of the orbit. It is probably, as IMacalister suggests, a displaced deep slip of the palpebral fibres of the orbi- cularis palpebrarum.

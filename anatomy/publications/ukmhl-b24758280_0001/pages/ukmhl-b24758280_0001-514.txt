THE SPINAL YEINS. 492 behind the bodies of the vertebra3 in the v/hole length of the canal: i. The posterior longitudinal veins, situated within the canal on the fore part of the arches of the vertebrae: e. The veins of the spinal cord. There are likewise branches of communication, some of which connect all the other sets together, and some which bring them into connection with the general venous system. (Breschet, " Essai sur les Veines du Eachis," 4to; " Traite Anatomique sur le Systeme Yeineux," foL, 1829 ; Cloquet, " Traite dMnatomie descriptive," &c.) a.—The dorsal veins. The blood from the muscles and integument along the back of the spine is returned by a series of short veins, which ramify upon the arches and spinous processes of the vertebrae. They run forwards close to the spinous processes, and on reaching the in- terval between the arches of the vertebrse, pierce the ligamenta sub- flava, and terminate in a venous plexus within the canal. Towards the outer part of the intervertebral grooves other veins arise, which pass obliquely forwards, through the intertransverse spaces, in company with the posterior branches of the lumbar and intercostal arteries, and open into the veins which accompany those vessels.

J).—The veins of tlie bodies of the vertebrae (vense basis vertebrarum, —Dupuytren) are comparatively large vessels contained in the canals within the bodies of the vertebrse ; the arteries which accompany them being very small. They anastomose on the front of the bones with some of the superficial veins ; and the trunk of each, having reached the spinal canal through the foramen in the posterior surface of the body of the vertebra, divides into two branches, which diverge and terminate in the large spinal veins behind the bodies of the vertebra. c,—The anterior longitudinal spinal veins.—The blood collected by the different vessels here described is poured into two large veins, or rather tortuous venous canals, which extend, one on each side, along the whole length of the spinal canal behind the bodies of the vertebrae. These vessels (the great spinal veins of Breschet) are alternately con- stricted and enlarged, the constricted points corresponding with the intervertebral foramina, where they are drawn forwards, and bound Fig. 314.

E, the sternum of a child at birth. 1, 2, .3, & 4, mark the commencing ossific nuclei but on each side of the column a considerable extension of the cavity is produced by the backward direction of the posterior parts of the ribs, and thus the weight of the body is thrown further back and is more equally distributed round the vertebral column. At the same time a broad furrow is produced between the spines of the vertebrse and the angles of the ribs, in which are placed the erectores spinse muscles. The intercostal spaces are eleven in number, somewhat wider above than below, and varying in width with the elevation or depression of the ribs. OSSIFICATION OF THE BIBS AND STERNUM. The ossification of the ribs begins in cartilage posteriorly about the eighth week, and extends rapidly forwards, so as to reach the permanent cartilage about Middle Eibs about eighteen or twen- ty years op age.

Subperiosteal ossi- fication contributes largely to their sub- sequent^ growth. After puberty the centres of two small epiphyses appear in the cartilage of the head and tubercle. These become united wath the main bone before the twenty-fifth year. The ossification of the sternum begins about the sixcn month, and usually by Fi- 26. Fig. 26.—Ossification of the Sternum. (R.

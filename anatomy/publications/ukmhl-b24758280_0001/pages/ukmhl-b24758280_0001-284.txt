262 COMPAEISON OF THE LIMB-MUSCLES. From what has been said it appears that considerable difficulty still prevails in the determination of the muscular homologies of the upper and lower limbs, especially in their proximal segments and attachment to the trunk, and the com- parison of these muscles cannot, therefore, be minutely followed out. But the following table may be useful to the student of human anatomy, as presenting what appear to be the most probable views of the muscular relations in the upper and lower limbs, and as indicating the bearing upon such views of some facts in comparative anatomy as well as of some of the varieties mentioned in the pre- vious description of the individual muscles. (Upon this subject consult the works, of Humphry, Mivart, Eolleston and Huxley, previously quoted in the Osteology.) 1. la. lb. 2. 2a. 3. Ba. 4. â– in. U.

The names of muscles printed in italics are those of varieties more or less frequently found in human anatomy.

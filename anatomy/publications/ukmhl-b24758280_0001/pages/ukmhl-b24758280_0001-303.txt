281 SUPEA-HYOID MUSCLES. of this muscle has been described by Macalister, as passing superficial to the external pterygoid to be inserted into the tuberosity of the maxillary bone.

Nerves.—The four muscles above desciibed receive their motor nei-ves from one source, viz.. the external muscular branches of the fifth pair, which may be traced to the lesser or motor root of that nerve. These nei-ves are named from the muscles they respectively supply. There are usually t^-o branches to the temporal, and one to each of the other muscles. Actions.—The masseter, temporal, and internal pterygoid muscles are elevators of the lower jaw, and generally act in concert, bringing the lower teeth forcibly into contact ^vith the upper. The opposite movement of depressing the jaw. not being opposed by any resisting obstacle, requires less force, and is effected by muscles of much smaller size, the principal of which is the digastric muscle hereafter described. The external pterygoid muscle, having the gi-eat body of its fibres nearly horizontal, di-aws forwards the condyle of the jaw, and, when the muscles of both sides act together, the lower jaw is protracted so as to make the lower incisor teeth project beyond the upper : but their more usual mxode of action is alternately on the two sides, as in the grinding movement of the molar teeth, in which the horizontal movements of the external x)terygoid3 are associated with the elevating actions of the other muscles. The masseter and internal pteiygoid muscles assist in protracting the jaw ; the temporal alone is a retractor. The two pterygoid muscles of one side, in advancing one condyle of the jaw, necessarily throw the teeth towards the opposite side. MUSCLES BSTWESN THE LOWER JAW AND THE HYOID BONE. The digastric mnsde, extending from the temporal bone to the lower jaw, consists of two elongated muscular bellies united by an intervening rounded tendon. Tiie posterior belly, longer than the anterior, arises from the digastric groove of the temporal bone, and is directed downwards, forwards, and inwards i the anterior is attached • to a rough depression situated on the lower border of the lower jaw, close to the symphysis menti; it is less tapering than the posterior belly, and is directed downwards and backwards. The intervening

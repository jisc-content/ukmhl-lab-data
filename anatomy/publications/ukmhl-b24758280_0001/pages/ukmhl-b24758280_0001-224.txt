202 MUSCLES OF THE UPPER LIMB. The dorsal scapular artery- passes between it and the bone. At its lower border is the teres major separated in part by the long- head of the triceps. A bui'sa is sometimes found be- tween the tendon and the bone. Fig. 171.â€”Superficial Muscles OP THE Shoulder and Upper Limb, seen froji behind. (A.

The explanation of the remaining references will be found in the description of fig. 182. The teres major muscle arises from the flat oval smface on the dorsum of the scapula near its inferior ang-le, slightly from the axillary border of the boue, and from the septa inter- posed between it and the teres minor and. infraspi- natus. It is inserted by a flat tendon about two inches wide, into the inner border of the bicipital groove of the humerus, behind and in contact with the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, to which it is ad- herent for a short space. Close to the insertion, how- ever, the tendons of these muscles are separated by a small bursa. The fibres of the muscle are longitu- dinal.

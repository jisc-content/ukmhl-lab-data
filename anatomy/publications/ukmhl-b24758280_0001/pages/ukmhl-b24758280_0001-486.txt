ARTEEIES OF THE LOWER LIMB. 464 malleolus ; whilst the tendon of the flexor longus poUicis is to the outer side of the artery. Relation io ihe Veins and Nerve.—The posterior tibial artery, like the other arteries below the knee, is accompanied Fig. 207. by two vence comites. The iiosterior tibial nerve is at first on the inner side of the artery, but in the greater part of its course the nerve is close to the outer side of the vessel.

Branches.—The posterior tibial artery furnishes numerous small branches, and one large branch—the peroneal artery. Small Branclies.—(ji^ Several mmcnlar branclies aiise from the posterior tibial artery, and are dis- tributed principally to the deep-seated muscles in its neighbourhood, besides one or two of considerable size to the inner part of the soleus muscle. iV) The nutrient artery of the tibia, which is the largest of its kind in the body, arises from the pos- terior tibial artery near its commencement, and, after giving small branches to the muscles, enters the nutrient foramen in the bone, and ramifies on the medullary membrane. This vessel not unfre- quently arises from the anterior tibial artery. (6) A coiniminicating branch from the peroneal artery, passing transversely, joins the posterior tibial about two inches above the ankle-joint. The peroneal artery lies deeply along the back part of the leg, close to the fibula. Aris- ing from the posterior tibial artery about an inch below the lower border of the popliteus muscle, it inclines at first obliquely towards the fibula, and then descends nearly perpen- dicularly along that bone and behind the outer ankle, to reach the side of the os calcis. In the upper part of its course, this artery is covered by the soleus muscle and the deep fascia, and afterwards by the flexor longus pollicis. which is placed over it as far as the outer

EXTENSOE MUSCLES OF THE THUMB. 219 the groove on the outer border of the lower extremity of the radius, and is inserted in the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. BeJatlons.—The upper pai't of tliis muscle is concealed by tlie commoii extensor, but it becomes superScial beneath, and together Tsith the nest muscle crosses the tendons of the radial extensors of the carpus, conceals the insertion, of the supinator longus, and, beneath the extremity of the radius, crosses the radial artery. The extensor prinii intsrnodii pollicis muscle lies close to the lower border of the extensor ossis metacarpi, and is much smaller than that muscle ; it arises from the interosseous ligament and tlie radius near the middle of the forearm ; its tendon accompanies that- of the extensor ossis metacarpi through the same compartment of the annular liga- men , and passes on to be inserted into the proximal end of the first phalanx. The e:^eiisor secundi internodii pcllicis muscle, much larger than the extensor primi internodii, which it overlaps, arises immediately below the extensor ossis metacarpi from the shaft of the ulna for two or three inche and from the interosseous ligament at its lower end for about Fig. 178.—Superficial Mus- cles AND Texdons on the Back op the Wrist and Hand (after Bourgery). ^ The posterior annular liga- ment of the wrist is represented. 1, extensor ossis metacarpi pol- licis ; 1', its insertion ; 2, ex- tensor primi internodii pollicis ; 2', its insertion ; 3, 3', tendon of the extensor secnndi mter- nodii pollicis ; 4, extensor com- munis digitonnn ; 4', tendon to the middle finger, receiving the insertion of the second and third dorsal interossei; 4", division of the tendon into three portions, of which the median is inserted into the second phalanx, the two lateral passing on to be inserted into the terminal phalanx ; the union of the tendons of the third, fourth, and fifth fingers is shown ; 5, extensor minimi digiti; 5', its junction with the slip of the common extensor ; 6, placed on the lower end of the ulna, points to the extensor carpi ulnaris; C, insertion of this muscle into the base of the fifth metacarpal bone ; 7, part of the flexor carpi ulnaris ; S, placed on the os magnum, points to the insertion of the extensor carpi radialis brevior ; 8', placed on the base of the second metacarj^al bone, points to the insertion of the extensor carpi radialis longior ; 9, tendon of the extensor indicis ; 10, small part of the adductor pollicis, and deep head of the flexor brevis pollicis; 11, first dorsal interosseous or abductor indicis : in the other three interosseous spaces are seen in succession, from the radial side inwards, the insertion of the first palmar, second dorsal, third dorsal, second palmar, fourth dorsal, and third palmar interossei muscles ; 12, abductor minimi di^dti.

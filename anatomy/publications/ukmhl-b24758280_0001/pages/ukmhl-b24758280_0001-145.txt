125 COMPAEISON OF THE AEM AND LEG BONES. Figs. 110 & 111.â€”Sketch OF THE Bones op the Thoracic and Pelvic Limbs so placed as to SHOW corresponding PARTS IN BOTH. (A. The preaxial borders of "both, limbs are towards the reader's right hand, and the dorsal or true ex- tensor surfaces are shown throughout the Avhole ex- tent of the limbs. The somewhat artificial rei:ire- sentation given in these figures cannot be obtained from a single view of the specimens in one position, but it is easily brought out by slightly shifting the bones or changing the point of view. The hu- meral tuberosities are separated so as to show them on the borders of the bone.

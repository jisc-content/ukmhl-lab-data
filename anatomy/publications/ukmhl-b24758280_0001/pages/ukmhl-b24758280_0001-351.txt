S29 PERINEAL MUSCLES IN THE MALE. rectum. The under or perineal surface, invested by the thin anal fascia, is covered by the fat which occupies the ischio-rectal fossa. Tlie posterior border is continuous with the coccygeus.

Fig. 229. The coccygeus or levator coccygei muscle is composed of flesh}? and tendinous fibres, forming a thin, flat, and triangular sheet, which arises by its apex from the spine of the ischium and the lesser sciatic ligament, and is attached along its base to the border of the coccyx and the lower part of the sacrum. The fibres of this muscle diverge as they approach the middle line, while those of the levator ani rather converge as they descend. delations.—The internal or pelvic surface of this muscle assists in supporting the rectum : its external or under surface rests on the front of the sacro-sciatic ligaments, and on the gluteus maximus muscle. The levatores ani and coccygei muscles together have been named somewhat appropriately by Meyer, the pelvic diaphragm. Varieties.—The coccygeus is sometimes inserted into the side of the sacrum instead of the coccyx. A few muscular fibres have been found extending from the lower part of the sacrum to the coccyx, both in front and behind. The anterior slip is decribed by Von Behr and others as curvator, and the posterior as extensor coccygis. (See Macalister, Muse. Anomalies, p. 66.) I. GENiTO-URmARY MuscLES.—Covered by the special fascia of the perin£i3um are three muscles, placed superficially—the superficial trans- verse, the ischio-cavernosus, and the bulbo-cavernosus ; while, situated more deeply between the superficial and deep layers of the subpubic fascia^ are the deep transverse muscle and the constrictor of the urethra, sometimes described as one muscle under the name of compressor of the urethra. The transversns perin^i muscle arises from the inner surface of the pubic arch, near the ischial tuberosity, and is directed obliquely forwards and inwards to unite with the muscle of the opposite side, as well as with the sphincter ani and bulbo-cavernosus at the central point of the perino3um. It lies immediately in front of the line where the perineal dips back to join the subpubic fascia.

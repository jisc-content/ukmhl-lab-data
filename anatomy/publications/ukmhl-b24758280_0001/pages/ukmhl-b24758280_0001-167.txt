147 SCAPULO-CLAVICULAR AETICULATIOX. The acromio-clavicTilar articulation is a synovial joint uniting the outer extremity of the clavicle with the inner edge of the acromion. It is supported above by a thick and broad superior ligament, and below by an inferior ligament which is not so strong. An inter articular fihro-cartilage is frequently present, but is sometimes wanting. It is wedge-shaped, attached by its base to the superior ligament, and only partially separates the small oval articular surfaces. Fig. 133.

I 1, acromio-clavicular articulation ; 2, conoid, and 3, trapezoid part of tlie coraco- clavicular ligament ; 4, near the suprascapular ligament ; 5, on the coracoid process, points to the coraco-acromial ligament ; 6, the capsular ligament of the shoulder joint; 7, the coraco-humeral ligament; above 6, an aperture in the capsular ligament through which the tendon of the subscapularis muscle passes ; 8, tendon of the glenoid head of the biceps muscle ; 9, right half of the interclavicular ligament; 10, interarticular fibro- cartilage of the sterno-clavicular articulation ; 11, the costo-clavicular ligament ; 12 and 13, the cartilage and small part of the second and third ribs attached by their anterior costo-sternal ligaments. The coraco-clavicular ligament, which connects the clavicle with the coracoid process of the scapula, is divisible into two parts. ^\i<^ conoid ligament, which is the posterior or internal fasciculus, broad above, narrow below, is attached inferiorly to the inner part of the root ' of the coracoid process, and superiorly to the conoid tubercle of the clavicle : its fibres are directed backwards and upwards. The trapezoid ligament, the anterior or external fasciculus, slopes upwards, backwards, and outwards from the inner border of the coracoid process to an ob- lioue line extendiiig outwards from the conoid tubercle, on which it is

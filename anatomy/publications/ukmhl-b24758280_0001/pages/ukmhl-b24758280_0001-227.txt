Tiie roiddle division of the ninscle is niosu consiau: in inan : but is generally accompanied by a part of the third : the mnscnlo-cutaneous nerre passing betTveen ihem. The first and third constitute the most marked varieiies in man. and all three are found in various forms and degrees of development in dinerent animals. The intemal brachial ligament of Stnithers is a fibrous band connected vdth the inferior part of this muscle. (John Wood, on Hum. 3Iusc. Variations. >^':c., Joiim. of Anat. vol. i. p. 45.)

The loiceps ilescr ciiMti muscle has two heads of ori.a'iii: one of these, the internal or short head, arises conjointly wirh the coraco- brachialis from the coraeoid process of the scapnla by a rendon which is soon continued into muscle : the other, the long head, arises by a rounded tendon from the upper border of the glenoid fossa and glenoid ligament, within the capsule of the shotilder-joint, and this tendon, passing ove]* the head of the humerus, leaves the joint by the bicipital groove, gradually enlarging into the fleshy head as it descends. The two muscular heads, lying side by side, then unite to form an elongated and thick belly, occupying the middle and lower part of tlie arm : a

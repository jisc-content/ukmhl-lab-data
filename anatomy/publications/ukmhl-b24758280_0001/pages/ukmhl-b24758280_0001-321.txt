Actions.—The serratus posticus superior elevates the upper ribs, and is there- fore to be regarded as a muscle of inspu'ation. The serratus inferior acts du'ectly as a depressor of the lower ribs, and raay aid either in expiration or inspii-ation ; in expiration by acting in conceii: with the muscles which depress the higher ribs ; in inspiration by fixing the lower ribs and giving firmness to the origin of the diapliragm. The vertebral aponeurosis is situated on the same plane as the serratus posticus inferior, and consists of a thin lamella which separates the muscles belonging to the shoulder and arm from those which sup- port the spine and head. Its fibres are for the most part transverse ; some however are longitudinal. Above, it passes beneath the superior serratus ; below, it is connected with the tendons of the latissimus and inferior serratus muscles, and in being stretched from the spinous pro- cesses outwards across the vertebral groove, it helps to enclose the angular space in which are lodged the long extensor muscles. Dorsal axd Lumbar Fasci.^:.—Under the name of lumbar fascia or aponeurosis it has been customary to describe three layers of scrong fibrous substance sheathing the erector spinse and quadratus lumborum muscles. The deeper parts of this structure, to which by some the name of lumbar fascia is restricted, will be described along with the abdominal muscles, with which they are chiefly connected. The sujjer- ficial or posterior layer is that through which the latissimus dorsi and serratus posticus inferior muscles are attached to the spines of the dorsal, lumbar and sacral vertebrae and to tl^iC crest of the ilium. This layer, which is of considerable strength, extends outwards beyond the origin of the latissimus and serratus inferior, and being closely united with the middle layer, binds down firmly the erectores spina3 muscles : it is by some described as the lower part of the vertebral aponeurosis, with which it is continuous, by others it has been named the aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi. The sPLEXius muscle is so named from its having the form of a strap, which binds down the parts lying under it. It is attached supe- riorly in part to the cervical vertebrte, in part to the skull, and is described accordingly under two names. a. The splenius colli is attached inferioriy to the spinous processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth dorsal vertebr£e, and superiorly along with the slips of the levator angtili scapulae to the transverse processes of the first two or three cervical vertebrae. 1). The splenius capitis, broader and thicker than the preceding, arises from the spines of the seventh cervical and two upper dorsal vertebra, and from the ligamentum nuchEe as high as the third cervical vertebra. It is inserted into the lower and back part of the mastoid process, and into the outer part of the superior curved line of the occipital bone. Belat'wns.—The splenius is covered by the trapezius, the rhomboid, and the serratus posticus superior ; and at its attachment to the occipital bone by the stemo-mastoid. It conceals, in part, the complexus and trachelo-niastoid. Erector Spin.e.—This muscle may either be regarded as one large composite muscle, or as consisting of seven distinct muscles. Viewed as one muscle it may be conveniently considered as formed of three

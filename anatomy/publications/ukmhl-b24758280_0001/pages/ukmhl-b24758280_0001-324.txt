DOESAL MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. Fig. 217.â€”View op the DEEP Muscles op the Back, showing their Attachments to the Vertebral Column and Ribs. (A. T.) i On the left side the seve- ral parts of the erector spi- nse are nearly in their na- tural position, with the exception of the spinalis dorsi, which is drawn out laterally from the spines of the vertebrae ; on the right side the spinalis dorsi has Ibeen entirely removed, the ilio-costalis drawn to the outer side so as to expose its accessory muscle, and the longissimus removed, excepting small iiortions at its insertions. Superiorly on the left side, the trache- lomastoid and complex us are left nearly in their natural positions ; while, on the right side, the trachelo-mastoid lias been entirely removed, and the complexus, separated from its occipital attachment, lias been spread out so as to stretch its vertebral attachments, a, occipital protuberance; b, mastoid process ; c, bifid spinous process of the axis ver- tebra ; I, spinous process of the first dorsal vertebra and first rib ; VI, sixth dorsal spine and trans- verse process and sixth rib ; XII, twelfth dorsal spine and twelfth rib. On the left side of the figure, 1, com- plexus muscle; 2, trachelo- mastoid ; 3, serratus pos- ticus superior, detached from the vertebral column and drawn upAvards from the ribs ; 4, 4, the slips of attachment of the serratus posticus inferior to the four lower ribs ; 5, three slips of origin of the latis- simus dorsi from the lower ribs ; 5', iliac origin of the same muscle ; 6 + , common origin of the lon- gissimus dorsi and ilio-cos- talis from the ilium and sacrum, &c. ; 6, upper part of the longissimus dorsi ; 6', transversalis cervicis continued up from the Ion*

The inferior divisions terminate at the tuberosi- ties of the condyles, and enclose be- tween them a flat triangular surface of bone, which is free from imiscular attachments, and forms the floor of the upper part of the popliteal space. Towards the superior part of the linea aspera is the foramen for the medullary vessels, directed upwards into the bone. The inferior extrernitii presents two rounded eminences, the condijles, united anteriorly, but separated posteriorly by a deep intercondylar fossa or notch. Their greatest prominence is directed back- wards, and their curve, as it increases towards that part, may be compared to that of a partially uncoiled piece of watch-spring. The external condyle is the broader and more prominent in front; the internal is the longer and aCi;!)iill!'^lll\^\\Vvm more ]_)rominent inferiorly. One large articular surface, coated continuously with cartilage, extends over both con- dyles, but, opposite the front of the intercondylar fossa, it is divided by -..^ two slight linear depressions into three ^ parts, an elevated surface on each side of the fossa for articulation with the tibia ; and a grooved anterior surface J5- m m 13

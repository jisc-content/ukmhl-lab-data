The outfr surface is in its greatest extent vertical, with a slight con- vexity, and forms part of the temporal fossa. From its lowest part a long process, the zygoma, takes origin. Fig. 34.

The zygoma, or zygomatic process, is connected with the lower and outer part of the squamous portion, and is of considerable breadth at its base, which projects outwards. It then becomes narrower, and is

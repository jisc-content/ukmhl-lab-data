On each side of 16, tLo external abdominal ring is indicated. It is further prolonged upwards by a slip which runs over the bicipital groove to the great tuberosity, and gives an offset to the head of the humerus. The lower or doubled end of the tendon is closely united with the insertion of the deltoid, and a slip is prolonged from its inferior margin to the fascia of the arm.

The anterior surface is subcutaneous in the ei-cater part of its extent being coyered only by some of the fibres of the 0 2

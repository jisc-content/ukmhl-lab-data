EXTEXSOE COMIVIUXIS DIGITOEOr. 217 onwards, are joined together towards tlie middle or fore part of the second phalanx, and, having passed beyond this, are inserted into the last pha- lanx. On the index and little fingers the tendons are joined before their division, by the special extensor tendons of those digits. Fig. 17".—Deep Posterior ]\ruscLES of the ^^S- 1' FoREARil. (A. T.)

On the back of the hand the tendon of the ring-finger gives off two processes, one on each side, the lateral vincula, which pass obliquely downwards to join the tendons of the middle and little fingers : in consequence of this arrange- ment it follows that, if those two fingers be flexed, the tendon of the ring-finger is held downwards, and it becomes impos- sible to extend that finger by the action of the muscle. The tendon of the index- finger is only miited to that of the middle finger by a loose transverse, semi- transparent band of fibres, and is free in its action. A synovial membrane invests the tendons of this muscle as they pass under the annular ligament. Varieties.—The varieties of the extensor communis cligitoimn resolve them- selves chiefly into the follo^ving, viz., 1st, the occasional deficiency of one or more of the tendons of insertion, and, 2nd, more fi-equently an increase in their number. This last goes in some instances to the extent of doubling the tendon to each of the fingers, and even to tripling it to one or two of them. More frequently, however, the increase of number of the tendons is limited to the index or little finger alone. The muscular substance is also liable to be divided more deeply than usual into distinct portions for a part or the whole of its len<rth.

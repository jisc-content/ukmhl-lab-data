Branches.—It has been already mentioned that the superior prof iLiida may give origin to the pos- terior circumflex artery, and that its own origin is sometimes transferred to a branch arising from the axillary artery. The inferior profunda is likewise occasionally absent, and on that account has not been recog- nised by some anatomists as a regular branch of the brachial artery. The anastomotic artery is sometimes much re- duced in size, and in that case the inferior profunda takes its place behind the humerus. SUHaiCAIj ANATOMY OF THE BEACHIAL ARTERY. The brachial artery may be easily reached for the application of a ligature in any part of its course. In the middle third of the aim its posi- tion on the inside of the biceps muscle, where its pulsation may be felt, is a sufficient guide for the incision. From the thinness of the parts covering the artery, however, and the proximity of super- ficial veins, especially the basilic, the integuments and fascia must be divided with caution. "When the fascia has been cut through the median nerve generally comes into view, as it lies in front of the artery. Occasionally it is found necessary to divide some muscular fibres before the artery is reached. In the lower third of the arm, the median nerve being placed to the inner side, the artery is more fully exposed after division of the fascia, but here care is necessary in passing the ligature round the artery, to avoid the vente comites or their communicating cross branches, which cling very closely to the artery. From the very frequent occurrence of varieties in the mode of division of the brachial artery into the vessels derived from it, the surgeon must be prepared for many deviations from the usual position of the parts, and especially for the presence of two arteries in place of one in the lower third of the brachial region, In such cases the two arteries are most frequently close together and nearly parallel, and it will be easy to tie both vessels, ishould this be rendered necessary by the nature of the injury for which the operation is performed. But, as will be seen from what has previously been said of the abnormal forms of the brachial artery,

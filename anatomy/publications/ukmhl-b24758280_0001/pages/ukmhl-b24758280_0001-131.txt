The summit of the spine presents two pro- minent tubercles, formed by the prolonga- tion upwards on its sides of the margins of the condylar portions ; the outer being turned slightly forwards, and the inner slightly backwards. On the sides of the upper extremity of the bone are two rounded eminences, the external and infernal taber- osities; the outer one of these, somewhat smaller than the other, is marked posteriorly by a fiat surface which articulates with the fibula, while the inner presents a groove for the insertion of the semi-membranosus mus- cle. Lower down, in front, is situated the anterior tuberosity or tudercle, rough inferiorly, vAieie it gives attachment to the ligamentum patellae, and smooth above, where it is covered by a synovial ])ursa. The shaft of the tibia is three-sided, and diminishes in size as it descends for about two-thirds of its length, but increases some- what towards its lower extremity. The internal surface is convex and subcutaneous, except at the upper part where it is crossed by the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles. It is separated from the external surface by a sharp subcu- taneous, slightly sinuous crest, the shin ridge, which descends from the anterior tuberosity, and is smoothed away in the inferior third of the bone. The external surface is slightly hollowed in the larger part of its e.xtent, where it gives origin to the tibialis anticus muscle : but beneath the point where the crest disappears it turns forwards, becomes convex, and is covered by the extensor tendons. The posterior surface is traversed obliquely in its upper third by the popliteal line—a rough mark which extends upwards and outwards to the external tuberosity, giving attach- ment to the soleus muscle, and separating a triangular area, in which the popliteus muscle lies, from the space below, which gives origin to the flexor longus digitorum and tibialis posticus.

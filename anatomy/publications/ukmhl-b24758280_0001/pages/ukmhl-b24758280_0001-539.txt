517 CERVICAL LYMPHATIC VESSELS AND GLANDS. cervical glands. From these glands efferent vessels issue, which pro- gressively diminish in number during their descent, and unite into two Fig. 327. The inner half of the right clavicle and part of the sternum have been removed so as to expose the arch of the aorta, and the innominate artery and veins â€¢ the posterior belly of the omo-h3^oid muscle is removed ; and the sterno-mastoid, steruo-hyoid, and sterno- thyroid muscles, and a part of the external jugular rem have been divided so as to expose the deeper parts. a, the right innominate vein at the place where it is joined by the principal lymphatic trunk ; a, the left vein ; 5, arch of the aorta : c, common carotid artery ; d, thyroid gland crossed by the anterior jugular vein; e, cut surface of the sternum ; /, outer part of the clavicle ; 1, submaxillary lymphatic vessels ; 1', sublingual ; 2, temporal, facial and parotid ; 3, occipital and posterior auricular : 4, deep or descending cervical close to the great vessels; 5, transverse cervical; 6, deep pectoral and axillary; 7, on the vena cava superior, some of the right mediastinal; 8, on the innominate artery, some of the deeper cardiac and bronchial; to these last are seen descending some of the lym- phatics from the thyroid gland and lower part of the neck. trunks, of which the left one ends in the thoracic duct, and the other in the right lymphatic duct: sometimes, however, the main cervical lymphatic vessel terminates separately at the junction of the subclav'an and internal jugular vems, or in one of those vems immediately before their union. The lymphatics of the cranium consist of a temporal and an occipital set. Those of the temporal set descend in front of the ear,

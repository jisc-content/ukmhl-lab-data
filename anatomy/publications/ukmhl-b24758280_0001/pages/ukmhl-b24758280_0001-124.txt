BONES OF THE LOWER LIMB. 104 long diameter directed downwards and outwards ; in the female it is more triangular, or narrowed at its lower part. In the recent state it is closed by a fibrous membrane, except in the neighbourhood of the groove in its upper margin. THE PELVIS'. The ossa innominata with the sacrum and coccyx form the osseous walls of the pelvis. Fig. 90. Fig. 90. Adult Male Pelvis seen fk03i before, in the erect at- titude op the BODY. (A.

Fig. 91. Adult Female Pel- vis (A. T.) i Similarly placed with that sho\vn in the Ijreceding figure, and illustrating by com- parison with it, the principal differences between the male and female pelvis. The numbers indicate the same parts as in the preceding figure. This part of the skeleton may be considered ns divided into two parts by a plane passing through the upper border of the symphysis pubis, the sacral promontory, and the ilio-pectineal lines. The circle thus com- pleted constitutes the drim or inlet of the lower or true pelvis; the space above it, between the iliac fossse, belongs really to the abdomen, but has been called the upper or false pelvis. The inferior circumference, or outlet of the pelvis, presents three large bony eminences, the coccyx and the tuberosities of the ischia. Between the tuberosities of the ischia in front is the suh-puUc arch, which bounds an angular space extending forwards to the symphysis, and is formed by the descending rami of the ossa pubis and the ascending rami of the ischia.

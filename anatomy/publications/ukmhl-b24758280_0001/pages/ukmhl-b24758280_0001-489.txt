THE EXTERNAL PLANTAR ARTERY. 467 anastomose with the dorsal arteries ; and (d) others which ai}pear in the furrow between the middle and outer divisions of the plantar fascia. B. J'rom the jjlantar arch are given off the following more important branches. {a^ The posterior perforating branches, three in number, pass upwards through the back part of the three outer interosseous spaces, between the heads of the dorsal interosseous muscles, and on reaching the dorsum of the foot inosculate vv^ith the interosseous branches of the metatarsal artery.

(J)) The <Z/(7/7«Z branches are four in number. The ■first digital branch inclines outwards from the outer- most part of the plantar arch, opposite the end of the fourth metatarsal space,, crosses under cover of the abductor minimi digiti, and runs along the outer border of the phalanges of the little toe. The second digital branch passes for- wards along the fourth metatarsal space, and near the cleft between the fourth and fifth toes divides into two vessels, which course along the contiguous, borders of those toes, and end on the last phalanges. The th ird digital branch, is similarly disposed of on the foui'th and third toes. The fourth ends in lili& manner on the third and second toes. The digital artery which supplies the opposed sides of the first and second toes,, and that which runs on the inner side of the first toe. arise deeply between the first and second metatarsal bones, usually from that part of the arch which is formed by the end of the dorsal artery of the foot. Thus, as in the fingers, collateral arteries pass along the sides of the flexor sui-face of each of the toes. Near the base of the last phalanx these inosculate so as to form an arch, from the convexity of which minute vessels pass forwards to the extremity of the toe, and to the matrix of the nail, (c) An anterior imforatinrj branch is sent upwards by each of the digital arteries of the three outer interspaces near its bifurcation, to communicate with the corresponding digital branch of the metatarsal artery of the dorsum of the foot.

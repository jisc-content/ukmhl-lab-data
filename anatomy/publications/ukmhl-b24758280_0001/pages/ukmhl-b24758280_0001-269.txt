247 EXTEXSOE BEEVIS DIGITOETjU. digitorum, from the lower fourth of the inner surface of the fibula, from the lower part of the interosseus membrane, and from the inter- muscular septum Avhich connects it on the outer side with the peroneus brevis. Fig. 192. Its tendon is inserted into the upper sur- face of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone.

Relations.—It is placed to the outer side of the long extensor of the toes, TA'itli which it is usually united at its origin, and it passes through, the same compartment of the annular ligament with tha,t muscle. Tarlcth'S—The peroneus tertius is sometimes as large as the extensor longus digitorum ; it has been obseiTcd to terminate on the fourth, metatarsal bone ; and it is sometimes altogether wanting. The extensor brevis digitorum pedis arises from the outer surfece of the OS calcis in front of the groove for the peroneus brevis muscle, and from the lower band of the anterior annular ligament. It divides into four tapering slips each of which terminates in a tendon ; the first or most internal of these, sometimes reckoned as a distinct muscle, is inserted separately into the dorsal surface of the first phalanx of the great toe near its tarsal extremity ; and the other three become severally united to the outer border of the extensor tendons proceeding to the three next toes. Belatlons.—It crosses the dorsum of the foot somewhat obliquely, resting on the tarsus and metatarsus, and lying beneath the tendons of the peroneus tertius and long extensor of the toes. Its inner tendon also crosses the dorsalis pedis artery and the anterior tibial nerve. Varicf icf!.—The tendons of this muscle vary considerably both as to number and position, they may be reduced to two, or one of them may be doubled. The inner part of the muscle very commonly forms a distinct cxten-wi' hivvis Jialluclj being separate at its origin from the rest of the muscle ; this is regarded by Henle as the normal arrangement.

521 CONNECTION WITH THE BEAIN. The deep connection or origin of these nerves is still in some cases a matter of considerable uncertainty. Where they can be followed, the fibres may be traced to, and probably in part arise from, certain col- lections of grey substance termed " nuclei." These nuclei are further connected by other fibres with each other and with the cerebral hemi- spheres. The deep origin of the first or olfactory nerves is still doubt- ful ; the second pair are connected chiefly with the optic thalami and corpora quadrigemina; the third and fourth with a nucleus deeply placed beneath the corpora quadrigemina ; the remainder w^ith a con- tinuous series of collections of grey matter which lie beneath the floor of the fourth ventricle and in the central part of the medulla oblongata, around the central canal, as low down as the decussation of the pyramids.

The following references apply to the roots of the nerves : I, the right olfactory tract cut near its middle ; 11, the optic nerves immediately in front of the commissure; the right optic tract is^ seen passing back to the thalamus {Th), corpora geniculata {i, e), and corpora quadrigemina {q) ; III, the right oculo-motor nerve ; IV, the trochlear nerve rising at v, from near the valve of Vieussens ; V, the trifacial nerve ; VI, the abducent ocular ; a, VII, 6. the facial and auditory nerves, and between them the pars intermedia ; a, VIII, h, the roots of the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumo-gastric, and spinal accessory nerves ; IX, the hypoglossal rerve ; C I, the separate anterior and posterior roots of the suboccipital nerve.

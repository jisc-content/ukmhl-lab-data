522 THE CEANIAL NERVES. Mode of exit from the cranium.—Each of the cranial nerves in leaving the cranial cavity passes through a foramen or tubular prolongation of the dura mater : some of these nerves or their main divisions are con tamed in distinct foramma of the cranium, others are Fig. 330. Fig. 330.—Internal View op the Base op the Skull, showing the places of EXIT OP THE Cranial Nerves. (A. T.) ^ The dura mater is left in great part within the base of the skull: the tentorium is removed and the venous sinuses are opened. On the left side a small portion of the roof of the orbit has been removed to show the relation of certain nerves at the cavernous sinus and in the sphenoidal fissure. The roots of the several cranial nerves have been divided at a short distance inside the foramina of the dura mater through which they respectively pass. I, the bulb of the olfactory nerve lying over the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone ; II, the optic nerves ; that of the left side cut short; III, placed on the pituitary body, indicates the common oculo-motor nerve : IV, the trochlear nerve; V, is placed on the left side opposite to the middle of the three divisions of the trige- minus, which, together with the ganglion and greater root, have been exposed by opening up the dura mater ; on the right side the greater root is seen; VI, placed below the foramen of exit of the abducent ocular ; VII, placed on the upper part of the petrous bone opposite the entrance of the facial and auditory nerves into the meatus auditorius internus ; VIII, placed on the petrous bone outside the jugular foramen opposite the place of exit of the three divisions of the eighth pair of nerves ; IX, j^laced upon the basilar part of the occipital bone in front of the hypoglossal nerve as it passes through the anterior condylar foramen. On the left side of the cavernous sinus, the third, fourth, and ophthalmic division of the fifth nerves are seen keeping towards the outer side, while the sixth nerve is deeper and close to the internal carotid artery.

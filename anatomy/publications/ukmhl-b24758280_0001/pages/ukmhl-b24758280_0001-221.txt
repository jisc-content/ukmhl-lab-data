199 THE DELTOID MT.'SCLE. MUSCLES AND FASCIA OF TH£ SHOULDER. Fascist:.—The deep fas- cia binds together ihe mus- cles of the shoulder ^yith considerable firmness, and over the back part of the deltoid and infraspinatus muscles assumes a tendin- ous appearance. A strong and somewhat isolated por- tion, bound down to the posterior and axillary mar- gins of the scapula, covers the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles as far as they are left uncovered by the deltoid muscle. On reaching the posterior bor- der of the deltoid muscle, this aponeurosis divides in- to two layers, of which the deeper is continued beneath the deltoid to the shoulder- joint, and the more super- ficial forms a thin aponeur- otic covering of that muscle, becoming more and more slender as it passes for- wards, and isattached to the lower border of the spine.

Muscles.—The deltoid imiscle is of a triangular form and coarsely fascicu- lated, and extends^ from the most prominent part of the shoulder down a third of

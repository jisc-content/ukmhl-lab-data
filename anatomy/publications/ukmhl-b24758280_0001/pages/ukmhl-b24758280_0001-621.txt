THE LUMBAR PLEXUS. 599 two branches proceed; one of these, the larger, forms part of the anterior crural nerve; the other, a part of the obturator nerve. The fourth nerve gives two branches, which serve to complete the obturator DXIT Fig. 366. â€” Diagrammatic Outline op the Lumbar AND Sacral Plexuses with THE PRINCIPAL NeRVES ARISING FROM THEM. ^ D,XII, placed opposite the divided roots of the last dorsal nerve ; L,I to V, oj)posite the roots of the five lumbar nerves : the loops uniting the anterior j)rimary divisions of these nerves together, and the first with the twelfth dorsal are shown ; S, I to V, and C, T, the same in the sacral and coccy- geal nerves ; p, placed on some of the nerves marks the pos- terior primary divisions cut short; j), p' the plexus formed by the union of the posterior branches of the third, fourth, and fifth sacral and the coccy- geal nerves ; d, the abdominal continuation of the last dorsal nerve, from which d' the iliac cutaneous branch arises; 1, 1', the ilio-hypogastric and ilio- inguinal branches of the first lumbar nerve ; 2, the genito- crural rising by a loop from the first and second lumbar ; 2', external cutaneous of the thigh rising by a loop from the second and third ; jps, branches to the psoas muscle along the lumbar plexus ; cr, anterior erural nerve from the second, third, and fourth lumbar ; tl, branches to the iliacus ; o&, obturator nerve from the se- cond, third, and fourth lumbar nerves ; ob, accessory obtura- tor ; IV', V, loop from the fourth a,nd fifth lumbar, form- ing the lumbo-sacral cord ; 3, superior gluteal nerve ; sc, sacral plexus ending in the great sciatic nerve ; 4, lesser sciatic nerve rising from the plexus posteriorly ; 4', inferior gluteal branches ; 5, infex'ior puden- dal ; 6', posterior cutaneous of the thigh and leg ; 6, 6, branches to the obturator in- ternus and gemellus superior ; 6', G', branches to the gemellus inferior, quadratus and hip-joint ; 7, twigs to the pyriformis ; 8, 8, pudic nerve from the first, second, third, and fourth sacral ; 9, visceral branches ; 9', twig to the levator ani ; 10, cutaneous from the fourth, which passes round the lowe; border of the gluteus maximus ; 11, coccygeal branches.

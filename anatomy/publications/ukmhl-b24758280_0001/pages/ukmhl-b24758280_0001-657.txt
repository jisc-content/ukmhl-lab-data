THORACIC XERVES AXD GANGLIA. 635 Fig. 384.—Diagrammatic View of the Sympathktic Cord of tiik RicnT Side, SHOWING ITS Connections with the Piuncipal CEUEBRo-SriNAL Iskrves and tub Main Preaoetic Plexuses. ^- Cenhn'o-splnal Nerves.—VI, n poi-tion of the sixtli cranial nerve as it passes tlirongti the cavernous sinus, receiving two twigs from the carotid jilexus of the sympathetic nerve ; 0, ophthalmic ganglion connected by a twig with the carotid plexus ; M, con- nection of the spheuo-palatine ganglion by the Vidian nerve with the carotid i)lexus ; C, cervical plexus ; Br, brachial plexus ; D 6, sixtli intercostal nerve ; D 12, twelfth ; L3, third lumbar nerve ; S 1, first sacral nerve ; S 3, third ; S 5, fifth ; Cr, anterior crural nerve ; Cr', great sciatic ; pneumo-gastric nerve in the lower part of the neck ; r, recurrent nerve winding round the subclavian artery. Siimpathetic Cord—c, superior cervical ganglion ; c', second or middle ; c", inferior ; from each of the?e ganglia cardiac nerves (all deep on this side) arc seen descending to the cardiac plexus ; d 1, placed immediately below the first dorsal sympathetic ganglion ; d 6, is opposite the sixth ; I I, first lumbar ganglion ; c g, the terminal or coccygeal ganglion. Preaortic and Visecral Plexuses.—p p, pharjmgeal, and, lower down, laryngeal plexus ; p I, posterior pulmonary plexus spreading from the pneumo-gasti'ic on the Ijack of the right bronchus ; c a, on the aorta, the cardiac plexus, towards which, in addition to the cardiac nerves from the three cervical sympathetic ganglia, otlier branches are seen descending from the pneumo-gastric and recurrent nerves ; c o, right or posterior, and c o'j left or anterior coronary plexus ; o, oesophageal plexus in long meshes on the gullet ; sp, great splanchnic nerve formed by branches from the fifth, sixtli, seventh, eighth, and ninth dorsal ganglia ; +, small splanchnic from the ninth and tenth ; + + , smallest or third splanchnic from the eleventh : the first and second of these are shoAvn joining the solar plexus, so; the third descending to the renal plexus, re; connecting branches, between the solar i^lexus and the pneumo-gastric nerves are also represented ; p n', above the place where the right pneumo-gastric j^asses to the lower or posterior surface of the^ stomach ; p n", the left distributed on the anterior or ui^jDer surface of the cardiac portion of the organ : from the solar plexus large branches are seen surrounding the arteries of the coeliac axis, and descending to m s, the superior mesenteric plexus ; opposite to this is an indication of the suprarenal plexus ; below r e (the renal plexus), the spermatic plexus is also indicated ; a o, on the front of the aorta, marks the aortic plexus, formed by nerves descending from the solor and sujierior mesenteric plexuses and from the lumbar ganglia ; m i, the inferior mesenteric plexus surrounding the coiTCsponding artery ; h y, hypogastric plexus placed between the common iliac vessels, connected above with the aortic plexus, receiving nerves from the lower lumbar ganglia, and dividing below into tlie right and left pelvic or inferior hypogastric plexuses ; p I, the right pelvic plexus ; from this the nei'ves descending are joined by those from the plexus on the superior hemor- rhoidal vessels, m i', by sympathetic nerves from the sacral ganglia, and by numerous visceral nerves from the third and fourth sacral spinal nerves, and there are thus formed the rectal, vesical, and other plexuses, which ramify upon the viscera from behind for- wards, and from below upv ards, as towards i r, and r, the rectum and bladder. and ligaments. Several of these branches enter the posterior pulmonary plexns. The branches furnished bv the Joicer six or seven gcmglia unite into three cords on each side, which pass doAvn to join plexuses in the abdomen, and arc distinguished as the great, the small, and the smallest splanchnic nerve. The Great Splanchnic Iferve.—This nerve is formed bv the union of small cords (roots) given off by the thoracic ganglia from the fifth or sixth to the ninth or tenth inclusive. By careful examination of speci- mens after immersion in acetic or diluted nitric acid, small filaments may be traced from the splauchnic roots up^vards as far as the third ganglion, or even as far as the first (Beck, in the " Philosophical Trans- actions," Part 2, for 184G). Gradually augmented by the successive addition of the several roots, the cord descends obliquely inwards over the bodies of the dorsal vertebrse; and, after perforating the crus of the diaphragm at a variable

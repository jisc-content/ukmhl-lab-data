The cor- responding branches of the left side come from the left recurrent laryn- geal nerve. Pulmonary "branclies.—Two sets of pulmonary branches are dis- tributed from the pnenmogastnc nerve to the lung ; and they reach the root of the lung, one on its fore part, the other on its posterior as- pect. The anierior pulmonary nerves, two or three in number, are of small size. They join with filaments of the sympathetic ramifying on the pulmonary artery, and with these nerves constitute the anterior fidmonarij ])lexus. Behind the root of the luug the pneumogastric nerve becomes flattened, and gives several branches of much larger size than the anterior branches, which, with filaments derived from the second, third, and fourth thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic, form the posterior pulmonary plexus. Offsets from this plexus extend along the ramifications of the air-tube through the substance of the lung. CEsophageal IbranGlies.—The oesophagus within the thorax receives branches from the pneumogastric nerves, both above and below the pulmonary branches. The lower branches are the larger, and are de- rived from the cBsophageal idlexus^ formed by connecting cords between 0 0 2

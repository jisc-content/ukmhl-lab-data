THE ANTEEIOR CRUEAL NERVE. 605 The sa7'torhis muscle receives three or four twigs, which arise in common with the cutaneous nerves, and reach mostly the upper part of the muscle. The rectus muscle receives a distinct branch on its under surface. The nerve for the vastus cxtevmis, of considerable size, descends with the branches of the external circumflex artery towards the lower part of the muscle. It gives off a long slender articular filament, which reaches the knee and pene- trates the fibrous capsule of the joint.

Another large nerve divides into two sets of branches, which enter the vastus hitcrnus and the cr urcus about the middle of those muscles. The nerve of the vastus internus, before pene- trating the muscular fasciculi, gives a small branch to the knee-joint. This <77'Z'v7'«Z^/?'nerve passes along the internal intermuscular sep- tum with a branch of the anastomotic artery, as far as the inner side of the joint, where it perforates the capsular ligament, and is directed outwards on the synovial membrane beneath the liganientum patella3. B. Middle cutaneous nerve.—The middle cutaneous nerve either pierces the fascia lata divided into two branches about four inches below Pouparfs ligament, or as one trunk ■which soon separates into two branches. These branches descend side by side on the fore part of the thigh to the inner side and front of the patella. After or before the nerve has become subcutaneous, it communicates with the crural branch of the genito-crnral nerve, and also with the internal cutaneous. This nerve sometim.es arises from the anterior crural, high up within the abdomen. C. Internal cutaneous nerve.—The internal cutaneous nerve gives branches to the skin on the inner side of the thigh, and the upper part of the leg; but tlie extent to which it reaches varies with the presence or absence of the " occasional cutaneous " branch of the obturator nerve. Lying beneath the fascia lata, this nerve descends obliquely over the upper

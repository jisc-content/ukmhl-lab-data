BRANCHES OF INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERT. 446 the scrotum and the upper part of the perinasum. Given off from the pudic artery in front of the hsemorrhoidal branches, it turns upwards parallel with the pubic arch, crosses the transverse muscle of the perinasum, and rims forwards under cover of the superficial fascia, between the erector penis and accelerator urin:e muscles, supplying- both. In this course the artery gradually becomes superficial, and is finally distributed to the skin of the scrotum and the dartos. Jt not unfrequently gives off the following branch.

(<:') The transverse lierineal ai-tery, a very small vessel, is frequently a branch .of the preceding, but in some instances arises from the pudic artery. It crosses the perinteum, and terminates in small branches which are distributed to the

475 THE FACIAL VEIN. VEIHS OF THE HEAD ANB liECK. The blood returning: from the head and neck flows on each side into two principal veins, the external and internal jugular. The veins of the head and neck have generally no valves. The external jugular vein is provided with a valve at its entrance into the subclavian vein, and in most cases w^ith another about the middle of its course : and the internal jugular is also furnished with valves near its junction with the subclavian. These valves, however, are not sufficient to stop the regur- gitation of the blood, or the passage of injections from below upwards. The veins on the exterior of the cranium and face converge and unite, so as to form two trunks, the facial and the temporal veins. The facial vein lies obliquely along the side of the face, extending from the inner margin of the orbit downwards and outwards to the ante- rior border of the masseter muscle. Eesting on the same plane as the facial artery, but farther back, and less tortuous, it has very nearly the same relations to contiguous parts. It commences at the side of the root of the nose by a vein formed by the junction of branches from the forehead, eyebrow, and nose, and increases by receiving others during its course. Below the jaw it inclines outwards and backwards, covered by the cervical fascia and the platysma muscle : and soon unites with a large branch of communication derived from the temporal vein, to form the temjwro-maxillary or common facial vein, a short vessel of con- siderable size, which joins obliquely the trunk of the internal jugular.

Thefron- tfilvein commences on the roof of the skull by branches, which descend obliquely inwards up- on the forehead, maintaining communications in their course vritli the anterior branches of the temporal vein. It descends vertically, parallel Vvath the corresponding vessel of the opposite side, with which it is connected by transverse branches, and ends in the angular vein. In some instances the veins of the two sides unite and form a short trunk, which again divides into two branches at the root of the nose. As it descends from the

THE COSTO-SPINAL ARTICULATIONS. 141 to that below. In the first, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, this ligarzent is inserted into only one vertebral body, and into no fibro-cartilage. Fig. 126.

The iiiterarticnlar liga- ment is n thin and short band of fibres, which passes trans- versely from the ridge separatiog the two articular surfaces on the head of the rib to the intervertebral substance, and divides the articu- Fig. 127.—Five Dorsal Tertebr.?5, with portions OF the corresponding Rib.^. }c 1 and 2 are i^laced on the lamina? of the vertcbroe. close to the interspinous ligaments ; 3, ligamentum sub- flavum ; 4, anterior costo-transverse ligament ; 5, poste- rior costo-transverse ligament. lation into two parts, each lined by a separate synovial membrane. The ligament does not exist in the articulations of the first, eleventh, or twelfth ribs, as these ribs are each attached to only one vertebral body by a single syno- vial joint. The COSTO-TRANSVERSE ARTICULATION' unites the tubercle and neck of the rib to the corresponding transverse process by a synovial joint and ligaments, and by a longer ligam^ent to the transverse process of the vertebra above. The posterior costo-transverse ligament is a distinct band extending outwards from the posterior part of the summit of the trans- verse process to the rough external part of the tubercle of the rib. The middle or interosseons costo-transverse ligament, consists of a series of short parallel fibres, which unite the neck of the rib to the anterior surface of the contiguous transverse process. These

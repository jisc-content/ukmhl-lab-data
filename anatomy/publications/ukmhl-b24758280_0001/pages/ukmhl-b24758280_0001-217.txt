Relations.—By its deep surface, tne serratus ningnus rests on the upper ribs, the intercostal muscles, and part of the seiTatus posticus superior. Its outer surface is in contact posteriorly with the subscapular and latissimus dorsi muscles, and foi-ms anteriorly the internal wall of the axilla, being subcutaneous in the lower part of its extent. Varieties.—Not unfrequently the lovrest slip of the muscle extends to the tenth rib : in other instances the number of costal slips is diminished, occasionally br the suppression of the first, but oftener by the absence of some of the lower digitations. so that the muscle does not pass lower than the seventh rib. The muscle has been obsen-ed divided into three parts : sometimes the middle part is absent ; and in various instances the seiTatus has been observed united partially with the levator scapulae, the external intercosials, or the external oblique. With the levator scapulce it forms one muscle in many mammals. K"erves.—The nerves which supply the anterior muscles passing from the trunk to the upper limb are all derived from parts of the brachial plexus. The nerve of the subclavius is a small twig from a loop between the fifth and sixth cervical nen^es. The large nerve of the serratus mrignus, called posterior thoracic, proceeds from the same nerves and pierces the middle scalene muscle. The nerves of the pectoral muscles, named anterior thoracic, are in two Fig. IGS.

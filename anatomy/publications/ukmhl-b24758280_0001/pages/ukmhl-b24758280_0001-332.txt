From both ligamenta arcuata diaphragmatic muscular fibres take their origin, and are directed upwards to the posterior part of the tendinous centre.

The fibres arising from the cartilages of the six lower ribs form a series of serrated slips interdigitating with the attachments of the trans- versalis abdominis muscle. They sometimes arise also in part from the osseous ribs. The fibres proceeding from the ensiform cartilage form a narrow slip, sometimes divided into two, on each side of wfiich there occurs an, interval, in which the lining membranes of the thorax and

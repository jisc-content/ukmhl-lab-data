The branches of the inferior mesen- teric vein correspond with the ramifications of the artery of the same name. They commence at the lower part of the rectum in the hsemorr- hoidal plexus, and unite into a single vessel near the sigmoid flexure of the colon. From this point the vein proceeds upwards and inwards along the lumbar region, behind the peritoneum, crossing between the transverse mesocolon and the spine, or farther to the left, and then passing beneath and behind the pancreas, it reaches the splenic vein in which it terminates. Varieties.—In some cases the umbilical vein remains in some degree pervious from the point where it joins the left portal branch, up to the inner surface of the rectus muscle, and is joined in the latter situation by a branch of the deep epigastric vein, thus establishing- a communication between the external iliac and portal veins. This communicating branch, according to Lusclika, is normal,

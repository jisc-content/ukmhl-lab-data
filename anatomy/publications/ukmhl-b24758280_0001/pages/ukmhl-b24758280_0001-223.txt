THE TERES MINOR MUSCLE. 201 Helat'wns.—The supraspinatus muscle is covered by tlie trapezius and the acro- mion process. The suprascapular nerve and artery pass beneath it. The infraspinatus muscle is bound do^n by the aponeurosis which superiorly and externally divides so as to enclose the deltoid muscle. It is covered by the deltoid at its upper and outer part, and by the trapezius at its upper and inner part, by the latissimus dorsi at its lower angle, and m the intermediate portion it remains superficial. Vaj'/efic.s:—The infraspinatus muscle is sometimes very closely united with the teres minor. The supraspinatus is very constant in its form and attachments. The teres minor muscle is placed along the outer border of the in- fraspinatus, and is intimately connected vrith that muscle, a series of fibres from a narrow obliquely grooved surface on the dorsum of the scapula close to the axillary border, and from aponeurotic septa between it and the infraspinatus and teres major muscles, and is inserted by tendon into the greater tuberosity of the humerus, immedi- ately below the infraspina- Fig. 170. — Muscles of the Right Shoulder akd Arm, seen from behind.

181 METATARSAL AND DIGITAL ARTICULATIONS. dorsal and plantar ligaments are short transverse bands stretching across the five metatarsal bones from one to another. The interosseous fibres, lyiug deeply between the bones, occupy the rough parts of their lateral surfaces ; they are of considerable strength and firmness. The intermetatarsal articular cavities are lined with synovial memdrane^ which in each is continued forw^ards from that lining the joints formed between the bases of these bones and the tarsus. The first and second metatarsal bones do not articulate laterally with each other. Traiisverse metatarsal ligament.—The digital extremities or heads of the metatarsal bones are loosely connected by a transverse band, Avhich is identical in its arrangement with the corresponding structure in the hand, with this exception, that it is attached to the great toe, whereas in the hand the transverse metatarsal ligament does not reach the thumb.

Metataeso-digital and Interdigital Aeticulations.—The heads of the meta- tarsal bones are connected with the small concave articular surfaces of the first phalanges by two lateral ligaments, an inferior ligament, to which sesamoid plates are united by scattered fibres, and a synovial membrane,—all which are closely similar to those which belong to the corresponding parts of the hand. In the first metatarso-digital articulation the sesamoid plate is divided into two parts, which are fully ossified, forming the sesamoid bones. These are held together by strong transverse ligamentous fibres, and being provided with cartilaginous surfaces, move upon the corresponding grooved cartilaginous surfaces of the first metatarsal bone. The articulations of the phalanges with one another are also con- structed on the same plan as those of the superior extremity. In each, the bones are held in contact by two lateral ligaments and an inferior

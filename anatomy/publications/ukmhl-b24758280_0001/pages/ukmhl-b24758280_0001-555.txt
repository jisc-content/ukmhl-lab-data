533 THE FIFTH PAIE. summifc of tlie petrons part of tlie temporal bone. Here the larger root alters in appearance : its bundles of fibres diverge and enter tlie Gas- serian ganglion. Ttie fasciculi divide and unite in tlie expanded part of tlie nerve, so as to form a plexiform network. The smaller root passes inside and beneath the ganglion, without its nerve-fibres being incorporated in any way with it, and joins outside the skull the lowest of the three trunks which issue from the ganglion.

The ganglion of the fifth nerve or Gasserian ganglion (ganglion semi- lunare), occupies a depression on the upper part of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, near the apex, and is somewhat crescentic in form, the convexity being turned forwards. It is flattened and striated on the surface. On its inner side the ganglion is joined by filaments from the carotid plexus of the sympathetic nerve, and, according to some anatomists, it furnishes from its back part filaments to the dura mater. distribution,—From the fore part, or convex border of the G-as- serian ganglion, proceed the three large divisions of the nerve. The highest (first or ophthalmic trunk) enters the orbit ; the second, the upper maxillary nerve, is continued forwards to the face, below the orbit; and the third, the lower maxillary nerve, is distributed chiefly to the external ear, the tongue, the lower teeth, and the muscles of masti- cation. The first two trunks proceed exclusively from the ganglion

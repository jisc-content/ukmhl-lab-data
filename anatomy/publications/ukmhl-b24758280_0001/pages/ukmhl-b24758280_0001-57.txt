The adult frontal bone is sometimes divided into two parts by a median suture, the frontal suture which may be regarded as the persistence of the original foetal condition. THE TEMPORAL BONE. The temporal "bone (os temporis) takes part in the construction of the side and base of the skull, and contains in its interior the organ of hearing. It is usually described in three parts, viz., an expanded anterior and superior part, the squamous portion with the zygomatic process, a thicker posterior portion, the mastoid, and below and between these the jwtrous portion, a three-sided pyramid, exhibiting at its base externally the aperture of the ear, and projecting forwards and inwards into the base of the skull. With these is combined in the adult the styloid process or bone. It articulates posteriorly and internally with the occipital bone, supe- riorly with the parietal, anteriorly with the sphenoid, by the zygomatic process with the malar, and by'^the glenoid cavity with the inferior maxillary bone. The scinamoiis portion, or squamo-zygomatic, extends forwards and upwards from its connection with the other portions, and presents superiorly an arched border which describes about two-thirds of a circle. The i?7ner surface is marked by cerebral impressions, and by meningeal grooves. At its upper border, the outer table is prolonged considerably beyond the inner, forming a thin scale with the fluted surface looking

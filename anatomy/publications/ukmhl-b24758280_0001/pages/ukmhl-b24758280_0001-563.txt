641 THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NER^7E. Internal branches.—These consist of tlie naso-palatine, and the npper and interior nasal, which ramify in the lining membrane of the nasal fossae and adjoining sinuses. The vjijier nasal are very small branches, and enter tlie back part of the nasal fossa by the spheno-palatine foramen. Some are prolong-ed to the upper and posterior part of the septum, and the remainder ramify in the membrane covering" the upper two spongy bones, and in that lining- the jiosterior ethmoid cells. A branch, as has been already stated, forms a connection in the wall of the maxillary sinus, above the eye-tooth, with the anterior dental nerve. The naso-palatim nerce, nerve of Cotunnius (Scarpa), long and slender, leaves the inner side of the ganglion with the preceding branches, and after crossing the roof of the nasal fossa is directed downwards and forwards on the septum nasi towards the anterior palatine canal, situated between the periosteum and the pituitary membrane. The nerves of opposite sides descend to the palate through the mesial subdivisions of the canal, called the foramina of Scaq^a, the nerve of the right side usually behind that of the left. In the lower common foramen the two naso-palatine nerves are connected with each other in a fine plexus ; and they end in several filaments, which are distributed to the iDapillge behind the incisor teeth, and communicate with the great palatine nerve. In its course along the septum, small filaments are furnished from the naso-palatine nerve to the pituitary membrane, (See fig. 402. This nerve was discovered inde- pendently by John Hunter and Cotunnius ; see Hunter's " Observations on certain parts of the Animal Economy; " and Scarpa, "Annotationes Anatomic^," lib. ii.) Posterior braxches.—Tlie branches directed backwards from the spheno-palatine ganglion are the Vidian and pharyngeal nerves. The Vidian nerve arises from the back part of the ganglion, which seems to Fig. 339.

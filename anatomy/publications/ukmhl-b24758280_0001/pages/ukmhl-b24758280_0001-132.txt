The inferior extremity, much smaller than the superior, is expanded transversely, and projects downwards on its inner side, so as to form a thick process, the internal malleo- lus. Inferiorly it presents for articulation with the astragalus a cartilaginous surface, which is quadrilateral, concave from before backwards, and having its posterior border narrower and projecting farther downwards than the anterior; internally the cartila- ginous surface is continued down in a vertical direction upon the internal malleo- lus, clothing its outer surface somewhat more deeply in front than behind. The external surface, slightly concave, is rough superiorly for ligament, and smooth belov/ for articulation with the fibula. The pos- terior surface of the internal malleolus is marked by a double groove for the tendons of the tibialis posticus and-flexor longus digitorum, and more externally by a slight depression where the flexor longus pollicis lies ; the inn2r surface of the malleolus is subcutaneous. The tibia is slightly twisted, so that when the internal malleolus is directed inwards, the internal tuberosity is inclined backwards. -12 15 li THE FIBULA. The fibula, or 2Jeroneal hone, is situated at the outer side of the leg: it is nearly equal to the tibia in length, but is much more slender. Its inferior extremity is placed a little in advance of the superior; and its shaft is slightly curved, so as to have the convexity directed back- w^ards, and, in the lower half, slightly inwards towards the tibia.

401 THE BEACHIAL AETERY. Relation to Nerves. — The median nerve descends in contact with the artery, lying* on its outer side at the axilla, directly in front of it below the middle of the arm, and on the inner side at the elbow. Of the other large branches of the brachial plexus which are closely connected with the axillary artery, none continue in the immediate neighbourhood of the brachial artery along the arm. The external cutaneous and circumflex separate at once from the vessel in the axilla, the musculo- spiral soon turns backwards in the musculo-spiral groove, and the inter- nal cutaneous and ulnar nerves descend vertically on the inner side of the limb.

Branches. — The brachial artery gives some small muscular branches, which are directed outwards and back- wards to the coraco-brachialis, biceps, and brachialis anticus ; and the follow- ing larger branches which incline in- wards :— VOL.

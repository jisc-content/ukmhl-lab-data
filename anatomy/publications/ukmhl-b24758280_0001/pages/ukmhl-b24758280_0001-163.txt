143 THE COSTO-STERNAL AETICULATIONS. is much strengthened by thick periosteum, and by the radiatin] bands of the costo-sternal ligaments ah'eady mentioned. Fig. 129. Fig. 129.—Articulations op the Sternum, Clavicle, and Ribs, as seen prom before. (a. t., after Arnold.) ^ On the right of the middle line the anterior ligaments are shown ; on the left side, the front parts of the clavicle, sternum and costal cartilages have been removed so as to display the articular cavities. 1 to 10, the anterior extremities of the ribs from the first to the tenth inclusive, on the right side ; 1' to 10', the costal cartilages of the left side from the first to the tenth ; at 1', the direct union of the first costal cartilage with the sternum is shown ; at the sternal ends of the cartilages marked 2' to 6', the small double synovial cavities are shown opened; between the costal cartilages on the right side, ligamentous bands are shown stretching over the inter- costal spaces ; and on the left side, by a section, small synovial cavities are shown between the adjacent edges of the intercostal cartilages from the 5th to the 9th ; on the front of the right half of the sternum the radiating anterior costo- sternal ligaments are sliown ; 11, the ensiform process ; 12, 12', the inter-clavicular ligament ; and be- low 12, the anterior sterno-clavicu- lar ligament; below 12', the sterno- clavicular articulation is opened, showing the interarticular fibro- cartilage and double synovial cavity; 13, the costo-clavicular or rhomboid ligament. Movements of the Kibs.—Each rib is capable of a certain amount of eleva- tion and dej^ression. and of rotation on an axis passing- betv^een its vertebral and sternal ends. The beads of the ribs are, hov^ever. bound down by the interarticular ligaments so tig-htly as to prevent any gliding- motion at the attachments of those ligaments, which may therefore be regarded as the fixed points round which the ribs are moved. ^^Tien the vertebral column is bent forwards, the ribs are depressed ; and when the column is rotated, the ribs of that side towards which the upper part of the trunk is turned are raised, and those of the other side correspondingly depressed. The move- ment of the tubercle of the rib on the transverse x>rocess is of a gliding description, in the circumference of a chcle of which the head of the rib is the centre ; and as the plane in which the opposed surfaces of the costo-transverse articulation in most instances lie looks upwards and backvv'ards. the ribs are moved backwards as well as upwards in inspiration, and forwards and down- wards in expiration. The combined movements of the thoracic walls in respira- tion will be described along with the actions of the intercostal muscles. It is sufiicient at present to state that the elevation and rotation of the ribs in inspi- ration are the main causes of the antero-posterior and transverse enlargement of the chest. The angular movement is greatest in the upper and least in the lowest ribs.

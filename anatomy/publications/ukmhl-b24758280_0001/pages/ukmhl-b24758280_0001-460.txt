438 COMMON ILIAC ARTERY. The common iliac artery of the right side is separated from the front of the last lumbar vertebra, the two common iliac veins being inter- posed. The artery of the left side is crossed by the branches of the inferior mesenteric vessels. Relation to Veins,—The left iliac vein, supported on the last lumbar vertebra, lies to the inner side of, and below the left artery. On the right side there are three veins in proximity to the artery; the right iliac vein lying behind the lower part of the vessel, the left iliac vein Fig. 281.—YiEw OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF A Male Pelvis SnowiNa the ex- ternal AND IN- TERNAL Iliac Ar- teries AND THEIR BRANCHES.

By these simple arrangements uniformity of election in all the Royal Colleges of Surgeons would be effected, and such a measure of Medical Reform introduced as would satisfy the most fastidious. The Fellows of the Royal Colleges of Physicians of England, Scotland, and Ireland ought, in my opinion, to be formed in a similar way, by election from among those only who have obtained the degree of M.D., as ordinary Members of their respective Colleges; the Counsellors likewise ought to be elected by the Fellows of their respective Colleges ; thus, three grades in each of the two great divisions of the profession would be formed—Members, Fellows, and Assessors or Counsellors; an equal number of the * Notwithstanding all that a well known Professor has written against the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, in his disingenuous article on Medical Reform in the Edinburgh Review, I must refer him to acts, not calumnious assertions, in proof of the liberality of our venerable body, and contrast these with those of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Dr. Knox, who is not a member of our body, made applica- tion to the Faculty to have his tickets recognised, on his coming to lecture in Glasgow on Anatomy. The Faculty immediately informed him that his request would be complied with. I made a similar applica- cation to the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and the answer which I received from their president, after taking the sense of the meeting on this point, was, that unless I became a member of their body, and paid them £150 sterling, my tickets would not be taken if I came to lecture in Edinburgh. What a contrast!

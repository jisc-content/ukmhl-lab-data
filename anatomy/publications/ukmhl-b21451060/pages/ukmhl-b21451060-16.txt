14 ing room. This is a part of Practical Anatomy which has been far too much neglected ; and it has been my object for many years to supply this desideratum. My store of instruments is always at command, and there is not a single blood-vessel in the body that you may not frequently delegate, without in the slightest degree injuring or interfering with the careful dissecting of the parts after your operation.* But it is not so much to the advantages, great as I have proved them to be, which you enjoy as students of Anatomy, that you have been induced to make choice of Glasgow before every other locality, for the study of your profession. Noâ€”I regard our splendid Hospital, and the incalculable advantages you must derive from the study of disease in all its variety there, with the accom- panying courses of clinical lectures by all the attending physicians and surgeons, as the principal cause of your preference of this locality. Averse as I do feel to draw comparisons, which must be always invidious, I cannot refrain from the expression of my candid opinion, after a most careful examination of every hospital of note, either at home or on the Continent of Europe, that the Glasgow Royal Infirmary presents to the eye of the medical and surgical pupil the best microcosm of disease which is any where to be met with. It has been said that the Surgical Wards of our Hospital are too much crowded with accidents and operation cases, * I rejoice that so much is this department of Anatomy and Surgery prized by the talented and experienced individual at the head of the medical department of the British Navy, that, by a recent regulation, no one can be promoted from Assistant to Senior Surgeon before going through a complete course of all the operations of Surgery on the dead body.

I am sorry to remark, that there are many even in the present so much vaunted and highly enlightened age, who act as if it was their opinion that a knowledge of this important science, upon which not only Surgery and Medicine, but Physiology and Pathology, must be founded, is to be obtained by an examination of plates, books, models, and diagrams, and seem to hold in utter detestation all those means which must, by every can- did inquirer, be acknowledged as essential. It asto- nishes me not a little to hear some superficial talkers express themselves as if gratification was derived from the pursuit of dissection for its own sake, and apart from a conviction of its utility as the basis of all pro- fessional knowledge, Who, even the most enthusiastic among us, I ask, w7ould prefer the pestilential air of the dissecting room, to the healthful atmosphere of the country or the snug fireside of his study, were it not for the solid advantage he thus obtains of a know- ledge of structures which must every day be the sub- ject of operation, or the basis of all his physiological and pathological reasoning. Besides its strictly professional bearing, what an important vantage-ground does the study of this science afford to its cultivators, in the illustration of the prin- ciples of natural theology on the one hand, or in un- folding the manner in which the wonderful powers of mental manifestation and corporeal organization are entwined on the other !

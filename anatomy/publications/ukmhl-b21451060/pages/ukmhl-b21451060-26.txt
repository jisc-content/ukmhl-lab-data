24 interests have been necessarily attacked, and so much conciliation attempted in vain, that I am not astonished this right honourable gentleman, disgusted with the selfishness, the illiberality,and the mutual recriminations of the contending parties, should leave the Doctors to settle their own differences, and give up the task of Medical legislation in despair.* In conclusion, however, I would respectfully suggest to him, that if he feels disinclined to adopt so extensive a measure of reform as that which I have above feebly sketched, let him, 1st, abolish the system of apprenticeship in England ; 2d, by means of a General Council, fix a standard curriculum for the diploma of Medicine and Surgery, which will confer equality of privilege throughout her Majesty's dominions, and lastly, establish a register of all such, entitling those alone to recover their debts ; and that even by these simple enactments he will confer a boon on the profession of inestimable value. * The fierce war waged in Dublin between Trinity College and the Royal College of Surgeons—one rejecting the tickets of the other,—and the intestine strife now going on in Edinburgh between the University and the Royal College of Surgeons on the same subject, afford proofs of tho absolute necessity of some strong controlling power being brought to bear on such practices.

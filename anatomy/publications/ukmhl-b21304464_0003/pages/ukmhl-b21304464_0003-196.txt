168 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. membrane, situated above the junction of the upper and under eye-lids at the outer and upper part of the orbit, and behind the outer end of the superciliary ridge. There is a small ligament, which has been de- scribed by Soemmering, which passes from the external and posterior part .of the lacrymal fossa under the gland ; by which this gland is retained in its place. The lacrymal gland is supplied by the ophthal- mic artery, The nerves of this gland are derived from the ophthalmic nerve. There is also a cluster of smaller lacrymal glands, situated between the larger lacrymal gland, and the upper eye-lid. Of the Lacrymal Ducts. My Father discovered the lacrymal ducts, which in the human body are small; they pass out from the anterior part of the gland, and do not com- municate with each other. There are usually only five or six ducts to be seen, which terminate on the inner side of the upper eye-lid,^ near to the outer angle of the eye *. The tears pass across the eye, and are diffused by the motion of the eye-ball, and are absorbed by the puncta lacrymalia. * Vide Plate 5. of my Fatherâ€™s Treatise on the Eye and La- crymal passages, in which the ducts of the lacrymal gland are represented, and bristles are introduced into them.

From the eighth day, the glands in the axilla are a little swelled in inoculation, and this gene^ rally subsides with the affection on the arm. Cancer of the Skin. The skin is also subject to cancer. The disease shews itself under the form of small superficial tubercles or warts, of a brown colour. These warts are most frequent on the alae nasi, lips, and eye-lids. These tubercles often remain indolent for a time, and in consequence of being irritated, become ex- tremely painful, generate cancerous matter, and pour out blood. The tumour rapidly extends along the skin, and penetrates, in some cases, even to the bones. Chimney-sweepers are subject to a particular kind of cancer in the scrotum, which has been described by Mr Pott. Tumours of the skin, originating from an en- largement of the arteries or veins of the skin, also occur. Small excrescences of a purple or blue colour are frequently observed in different parts of the skin ; sometimes they are of a brown colour, rough, warty, and hairs grow from them. These have been called need materni.

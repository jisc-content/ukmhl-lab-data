OUTLINES OF ANATOM?. ments of the membranes of the round and oval > holes. The pulpy membrane of the vestible and cochlea, on which the branches of the portio mollis are dis- tributed, is the most essential part of the organ of hearing, and upon which the sense depends; all the other parts of this complex organ, are but of secondary importance. There is another nerve proper to the ear, the course of which, is very remarkable, called portio dura, which goes through the canal of Fallopius; from which a reflected branch is derived, which passes through the foramen innominatum in the pars petrosa, and is connected with the portio dura, and second part of the fifth pair of nerves; another branch, called chorda tympani, runs across the tympanum, between the inferior crus of the in- cus and the handle of malleus, at the outside of the Eustachian tube, to join the lingual of the fifth pair; and in its passage distributes branches to the muscles of the malleus and membranes of the tym- panum.

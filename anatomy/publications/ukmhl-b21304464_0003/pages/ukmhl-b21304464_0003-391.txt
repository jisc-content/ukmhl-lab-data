OF THE POPLITEAL ARTERY. 363 ^vhich, at its origin, is covered by the gastrocne- mius muscle, becomes more superficial at the head of the fibula, sends a few small branches to the cuvity of the joint, and anastomoses with the superior external, and superior internal articular artery, under the ligament of the patella. The fifth articular artery has been called the arfe- ria media: it is situated between the condyles of thethigh-bones, and suddenly subdivides into many small branches, which are distributed upon the capsular ligament and fat of the posterior part of the knee-joint. The popliteal artery descends between the heads of the gastrocnemii muscles, to which it gives se- veral branches, called sui'al; and opposite to the under edge of the popliteus -^muscle, divides into two large branches, the Tibialis Postica and Antica. The Anterior Tibial Artery perforates the upper part of the interosseous ligament; descends along the anterior surface of it between the tibia- lis anticus and extensor digitorum longus mus- cles. Above the ancle, it is situated upon the fore- part of the tibia ; it then passes under the annu- lar ligament j then between the extensor longus pollicis and tibialis anticus muscle, and passing along the upper part of the foot, at the root of the first metatarsal bone, it passes through to the sole of the foot, and communicates with the ex- ternal plantar artery.

S9 DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY. CHAPTER IL ON THE ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE URINARY ORGANS. Sect. I. ' OF THE ORGANIC DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY. rHE secretion of urine is sometimes \vholly or partially interrupted, constituting the disease called ischuria renalis *. The kidneys are sometimes inflamed. I have seen the smaller branches of the renal artery,* distended with blood in persons who have died with the symptoms of diabetes; but this mor- bid appearance is by no means constant. Suppuration is not an uncommon consequence of inflammation of the kidney, when calculi have been lodged within the pelvis of that organ ; and we also sometimes meet with the scrofulous sup- puration of that organ. Urinary concretions have sometimes w^orked their way through fistulous orifices, the conse- quence of suppuration of the kidney. * Vid. Etmdller, de Morb. intern. Cur. cap. 12.

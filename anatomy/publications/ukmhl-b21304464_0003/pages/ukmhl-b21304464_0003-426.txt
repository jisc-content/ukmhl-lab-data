Ganglia have been considered by some authors, as being analogous to the brain in office f, as being sour- ces of nerves, which are distributed upon the in- voluntary organs, and as independent of the brain, being reservoirs of nervous power, which they are capable of dispensing after the communication with the brain has been cut off. The arguments which have been advanced in support of the above theory, are, 1st, That the organs of involuntary motion con- tinue to exercise their functions in cases of per- fect hemplegia; and it has been added, that without the interposition of ganglia, there must be a de- fect in the functions of the viscera of the tho- rax and abdomen, a loss of half their nervous power. * Vid.

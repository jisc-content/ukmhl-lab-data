The younger the fcetus, the slighter the con- nection of the testes to the psoie muscles. The spermatic arteries take their rise from the aorta, a little below the renal arteries. The testes also receive their bloo4 by branches of the hypo- gastric artery, which ascend and pass close to the vas deferens. The veins of the testes are similar to those of the adult. The testes are connected by a ligament, which extends between the lower end of the testis and scrotum, which Mr J. Hunter calls gubermculum, which he has thus described : “ It is of a pyra- midal form, its large bulbous head upwards, and fixed at the lower end of the testis and epididymis, and its lower and slender extremity is ost in the cellular membrane of the scrotum This ligament, or gubernaculum, is fibrous, and provided with bloodvessels, The testes generally descend about the eighth month into the scrotum, but, ip some cases, stick in the groin. The passage through which the testes had passed, remains open in some cases. ■ Vid. Observations on certain parts of the Animal Economy^ H^ge 6.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY, 114 The nervous energy and electrical matter differ essentially in their properties.' Thus, opium and other poisons applied to the brain or muscles, destroy the nervous energy, but not electrical matter. On the other hand, mechanical and chemical substances applied to the brain, trunks of the nerves, or muscles, give pain and rouse the mus- cles into convulsive actions. Simple pressure of the brain impairs the energy of the nerves, and when that is removed, the ef- fects cease. Moderate pressure on the trunk of a nerve be- numbs the part on which the nerve is dispersed, and takes away the power the mind has, of throw- ing the muscles into action, on which the nerve terminates. On removing the pressure, the mind recovers its feeling, and power of acting ; from which it ap- , pears, that the pressure has produced its effects without destroying the texture of the nerve. A tight ligature, or a transverse section of a nerve, destroys its powers, even although the divi- ded parts of the nerve are again brought into con- tact ; whereas a ligature thrown around a nerve, or even the dividing it, does not arrest the pro- gress of the electrical matter, providing the cut ends are brought into contact. After one of the limbs of a living animal is cut off, its muscles may be repeatedly convulsed by irritating its nerves, by means of mechanical or

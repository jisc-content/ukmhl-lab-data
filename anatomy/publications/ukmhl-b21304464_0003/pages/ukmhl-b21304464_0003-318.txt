OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 2Â£)0 Bloodvessels of the Spinal Marrow. 0 The bloodvessels of the spinal marrow are de- rived from the vertebral, intercostal and lumbar arteries. The anterior spinal arteries take their rise from the vertebral arteries, descend along the whole of the anterior surface of the spinal marrow, and in the neck anastomose with the thyroid and cervi- cal arteries, in the back with the intercostal and lumbar arteries. The posterior and smaller arteries of the spinal marrow, are derived from the inferior cer- vical arteries of the cerebellum, or from the. trunks of the vertebral arteries within the skull. These arteries of the spinal marrow are subdi- vided into very small branches, which are distri- buted'^hpon the medulla and its membranes *. * Vid. A more full descriptioa of the spinal marrow in my Father's Treatise on the Nervous System, p. 28, 39, &c. Vid. also Tab. x. affixed to the Nervous System.

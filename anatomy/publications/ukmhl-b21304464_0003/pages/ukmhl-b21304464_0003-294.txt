266 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY* The next arteries sent off are called the supe- rior and inferior coronaryy which form an arte- â€¢ rial circle around the lips. A few small branches are sent off from this artery, which supply the cartilages of the nose. A branch called posterior artery of the ear^ is derived from the external carotid \ it is spent on the back-part of the ear. The Occipital is a large branch of the external carotid : it is covered by the digastric muscle at its origin ; it passes across the jugular vein, and be- tween the mastoid process and first vertebra of the neck ; in which course it is covered by thetrachelo- mastoid, splenius, and complexus muscles, and at length subdivides into many branches, which are distributed upon the middle of the back-part of the head. This artery also gives off branches to the di- gastric muscle, to the cervical glands, and anasto- moses with the thyroid artery. A branch of this artery, called auriciilary sup- plies the lobe of the ear, the parotid gland, and upper part of the sterno-mastoid muscle. A branch of this artery passes downwards, and is distributed upon the trachelo-mastoid muscle, and the other adjacent muscles. The External Temporal Artery, isthe^next large branch of the external carotid artery; it is co- vered by the parotid gland, and afterwards passes between the jaw and the meatus auditorius exter-

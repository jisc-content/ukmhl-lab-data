OF THE POPLITEAL ARTERY. 861 wards dips into the substance of the vastus exter- nu6, and anastomoses with the branches of the ex- ternal circumflex muscle. The branches of the fourth perforating artery^ are distributed upon both heads of the biceps ; and some of its branches are distributed upon the semitendinosus, and semimembranosus muscles. About two-thirds down the thigh, the trunk of the superficial femoral passes obliquely backwards between the tendon of the adductor magnus and the thigh-U)ne, and reaches the back-part of the thigh-bone, and then descends into the ham, where its cellular membrane is lodged in fat, and cover- ed by the corresponding vein, and the sciatic nerve, and well protected by the condyles of the thigh-bones. Of the Popliteal artery. There are five branches of the popliteal artery, called its articular branches, three of which are placed on the inner, and two on the outer side of the knee-joint; these branches anastomose with each other, and with the branches of the ar- teria profunda femoris, and also with those of the ^superficial femoral artery. The first branch of the popliteal artery ascends from the ham, towards the inner and lower part of the thigh, and is lost in the vastus internus

MUSCLES OF THE EYE-BALL, 159 proceeding from an object, and which diverge as they advance, are collected by the humours of thÂ© eye, and especially by the crystalline. The cone of rays, of a luminous body, forms, after passing through the crystalline lens, a second cone, the apex of which falls on the retina. The rays of light, which are perpendicular to the middle of the lens, proceed directly to the retina ; those on the left proceed to the right, and so on with the other rays; hence the image form- ed on the retina, is inverted. In the above very general account of the struc- ture of the eye, I have not endeavoured to describe the form, proportion, or refractive powers of the transparent parts of the eyes, nor the radii of their curvatures, because the limits of these Outlines prevent me from entering more at large into the? physiology of the several parts of the eye. Sect. VII. MUSCLES OF THE EYE-BALL. There are six muscles which move the eye- ball ; five of which take their origin from the sides of the foramen opticum, and have been named from their direction, or apparent action,

134 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Sect. VI. OF THE NERVES CONNECTED WITH THE BRAIN, The nerves have been divided into two great classes, viz. those said to be connected with the brain, which have been named the cerebral iiewes^ and those connected with the spinal marrow, cal- led spinal nerves. < Nine or ten pairs of nerves are described by anatomists, as taking their origin from the bruin, besides the sympathetic nerve; and twenty-nine or thirty pairs of nerves from the spinal marrow, besides the accessory nerves. But from what has been above stated, it follows, that the term origin is incorrect, as the brain might as well be said to arise from the nerves, as the nervesfrom the brain. It may be further observed, that anatomists differ very much in their statements, respecting the particular part of the brain or cerebellum, from which the nerves are said to originate ; it be- ing very difficult to trace a nerve to its real source from the medullary matter of the brain or cerebellum ; for they sink deep into the substance of the brain, and the fibres probably are intimate- ly intermixed with those of other nerves. Soemmering supposed, that the roots of the nerves, especially of the nerves of the organs of

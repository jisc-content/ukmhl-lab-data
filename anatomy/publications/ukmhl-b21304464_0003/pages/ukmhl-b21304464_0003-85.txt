OT THE PENIS. 5J7 The nature of the fluid, secreted by these glands, Jias not been discovered. • Sect, VI. OF THE PENIS. The penis, the vehicle by which the semen is introduced within the vagina of the female, is of a cellular structure, in order that it may be occa- sionally elongated, distended, and erected. The cellular structure of this organ is divided between two tubes, called corpora cavernosa penis, which are inclosed within a strong fibrous and elas- tic membrane, which bears a resemblance to a ligament, and which are disunited by an imper- fect partition, so that air or water thrown into one corpus cavernosum, readily fills the other. Both extremities of the corpora cavernosa are smaller than their bodies, and covered at their an- terior part by the glans penis; behind, they di- varicate from each other, like the strokes of the letter Y, under the symphysis pubis; and becom- ing gradually smaller, are inserted on each side by their conical extremities, into the ascending branches of the ossa ischia. The intervening spaces between the corpora cavernosa penis, are occupied by the vena ipsius penis, and the urethra ; the former is placed up- on the upper, and the latter upon the under surface «f the penis.

382 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. in the artery was florid as usual, and passed with a motion that was pulsatory, although weaker than natural.‚Äù That distinguished author very lately sent me the result of one of his experiments. Mr Fyfe jww/or, who dissected the Dog, has fa- voured me with the following account of what he had observed : The aorta was tied about an inch and a half above its division. The anastomosis between the superior and in- ferior mesenteric arteries was very much enlarged; and that artery described a tortuous course. The four uppermost lumbars on each side were very much enlarged. There was an anastamosis between the third and fourth lumbar on the right side, at the side of the lumbar vertcbrie. There were two very large anastomoses between the second and third lumbars, lying between the vertebrae and muscles of the loins on the left side; and another between the third and fourth of the same side. A small branch ran from the second lumber ar^ tery, to near the bifurcation of the aorta. The first and second lumbars came off above the obliteration of the aorta ; the third on the right side seems to have been included between the two ligatures.

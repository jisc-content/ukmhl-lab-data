T. he sac, which is of an oblong figure, is covered by the cremaster muscle, and the thin fascia of the abdominal muscles. On account of the greater shortness of the omen- tum of children, that organ is seldom contained within the hernial sac. As life advances, in consequence of the omen- tum being elongated, it gets into the hernial sac, which originally contained only a portion of the small intestine. Mr A. Burns communicated to me a case, which forms an exception to the above observation. He met with an instance in a new-born child, of the omentum, which had previously adhered to the testicle, being dragged from the abdomen, along with that organ. It sometimes happens, as in a case related by Mery, in the Academy of Sciences at Paris, 1701, that the omentum, which had been displaced, has involved the testicle, which led the surgeon to sup- pose, that the patient was afflicted by a sarcocele.

If the testicle, before it has reached the scrotum, contracts an adhesion with the other viscera of the abdomen, it may retard, or may prevent the de- scent of the intestines. Wrisberg has described several cases, in which the patients afflicted by this variety of hernia^

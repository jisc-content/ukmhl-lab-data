OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 436 thy^nus^ lodged in the anterior mediastinum, is of considerable bulk and length in the foetus, and di- vides at its lower part into two lobes, and the sub- stance of it is soft, and exhibits somewhat of a lobulated appearance ; and when cut, a whitish liquor may be squeezed out from it. The bloodvessels of this gland are derived from the subclavian, vertebral, thyroid, and diaphrag- matic arteries. The heart of the foetus is very different from that of the adult in many respects ; it is of a co- nical form, and proportionally larger, and in a very young embryo seems to fill the greater part of the thorax. There is a passage of communication between the anterior and posterior auricles, called the fora- men ovale ; the size of which, is very different in foetuses of different ages. This passage between the auricles, is by no means direct; it is oblique, and in figure some- what resembles a crescent; and the valve of the foramen ovale is formed by a fold of the lining of the auricle, and its loose edge is turned towards the left auricle. â€¢ The blood from the right auricle readily opens this valve, but cannot flow back into the right auricle, for the refluent blood shuts the valve. The valve, called the Eustachian, situated at the mouth of the vena cava inferior, is more perfect and larger in the foetus, than in the adult.

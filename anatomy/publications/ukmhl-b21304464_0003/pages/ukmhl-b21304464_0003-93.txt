65 OF THE UTERUS OR WOMB. The uterus is loosely connected to the sides of the pelvis by ligaments, and by cellular sub- stance. There is a doubling of the peritoneum, called the broad ligament of the uterus, extending from its sides to the sides of the pelvis, nearly in the course of the transverse diameter of the pelvis. The cavity of the womb bears but a small pro- portion to the external bulk of the organ, its pa- rietes being very thick. The uterine or fallopian tubes are affixed to the fundus uteri. The uterus is lined by a very soft and very vas- cular membrane. This at the neck of the uterus is tucked up into rugae, which are disposed trans- versely, and |)y some have been described as be- ing disposed in a foliated direction, like the leaves of the palm-tree. Between the rugae, there are several lacunae, which secrete a mucous fluid. The parietes of the uterus, when divided, ex- hibit a fibrous structure j and the fibres are dis- posed so irregularly, that it is impossible to detect their course. The uterus is very largely supplied with blood by the spermatic and uterine hypogastric arteries, the branches of which freely anastomose with each other. The spermatic arteries arise, as in the male, from the fore-part of the aorta, between the renal and VOL. III. E

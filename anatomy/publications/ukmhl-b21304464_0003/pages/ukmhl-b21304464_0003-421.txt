Sect. II. ' f Â» GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE DEVIATIONS FROM THE USUAL COURSE OF THE BLOODVESSELS ABOVE DESCRIBED. From the preceding statement respecting the irregularities in the distribution of the carotid ar- teries and their branches, it follows, 1st, That much danger may result from opening the wind- pipe, when the thyroid artery runs in the front of that canal. 2d, That as the carotides communes sometimes divide into external and internal caro- tids low in the neck, this might embarrass a surgeon w^ho was unacquainted with that fact in performing this operation for the carotic aneurism.

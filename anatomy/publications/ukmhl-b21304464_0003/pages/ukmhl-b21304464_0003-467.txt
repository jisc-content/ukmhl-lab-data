ORGANS OF THE FOETUS. 43& Of the Organs of Urine and Generation of the Foetus. The kidneys of the foetus consist of distinct lobes. The renal glands are almost as large as the kidneys, somewhat triangular in form, flatten- ed, and are largely supplied with blood from the diaphragmatic, renal, and lumbar arteries. The corresponding veins terminate in the renal veins, or in the vena cava inferior. The pelvis of the foetus is proportionally much smaller than that of the adult ; and hence the bladder of urine, in a very yOung foetus, may be enumerated rather among the bowels of the ab- domen, than among those of the pelvis. The bladder of urine of the foetus is more of a conical form, and,the urethra takes its rise nearer to the lowest part of the bladder than in the adult. The fundus uteri and Fallopian tubes, are also placed much higher than in the adult. The uterus of the foetus, is of a prismatic form, and proportionally longer than'in the adult. The testes of the male, and the ovaria of the female, are lodged originally in the cavity of the abdomen, below the kidneys on the psoae muscles, to which they are connected by the peritoneum. - The shape and figure of the testis, when wdthin Ee4

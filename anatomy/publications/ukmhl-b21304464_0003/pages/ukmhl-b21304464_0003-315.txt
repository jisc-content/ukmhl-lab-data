OF THE ACCESSORY NERVE. 287 and a third ganglion opposite to the head of the first rib. There are branches derived from the upper ganglion, which join with the sub-occipital nerve, and others, which, with small nerves derived from the glosso-pharyngeus nerve, form a plexus which covers the external carotid artery. A few nerves connect the uppermost ganglion of the sympa- thetic nerve with the first and second cervical nerves. From the ganglia of the sympathetic nerve, small nerves are derived, wfiich creep along the trunks of the subclavian artery and aorta, to the heart. Of the Accessoi'y Nerve. The accessory nerves arise from the sides of the medulla oblongata, and spinal marrow, and pass out at the foramen lacerum in basi cranii, along with the par vagum of the eighth pair. This nerve is connected by filaments to the posterior bundle of some of the spinal nerves, j The accessory nerves are then detadied from the eighth pair, and perforate the sterno-mastoid muscles, and terminate on the trapexius muscle. There is a branch of this nerve which is sent off before it perforates the stemo-mastoid muscle, which assists in forming the phsryngeal nerve,

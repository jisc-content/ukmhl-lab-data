NERVES, &C. OF INFERIOR EXTREMITV. 371 are also lymphatic vessels which accompany the tibial and fibular arteries, and these are connected with the popliteal glands, from which three or four lymphatic vessels pass upwards, and accom- pany the superficial femoral artery, and at length are connected with the inguinal glands. The lymphatic vessels of the scrotum, penis and glutei muscles also enter the inguinal glands. Sect. V. OF THE NERVES OF THE LOINS, AND INFERIOR EX- TREMITIES. The nerves of the loins and inferior extremi- ties are derived from the sympathetic^ lumbar and sacral nerves. Of the Sympathetic Nerves. The Sympathetic Nerves, after supplying the abdomen, approach each other upon the ante- rior part of the lumbar vertebrae, between the psoas muscle and the tendinous crura of the dia- phragm. These nerves descend, then pass over the anterior part of the os sacrum, at the inner sides of the foraminaâ€™of the os sacrum, and ter- minate upon the surface of the ossa coccygis;, when they are united by a transverse nerve. lA. a 2

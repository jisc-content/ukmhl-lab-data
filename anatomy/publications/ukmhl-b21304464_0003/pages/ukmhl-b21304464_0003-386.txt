3-58 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. A branch of this artery anastomoses with a branch of the obturator artery. Small branches of this artery also anastomose, upon the capsular li- gament of the hip-joint, with those of the gluteal artery. The internal circumflex then passes behind the lesser trochanter, and is subdivided into many small branches, some of which sink into the sub- stance of the triceps adductor femoris, others sup- ply the quadratus femoris, and obturator internus muscles. A descending branch of this artery passes outwards from beneath the quadratus femoris, anastomoses with the branches of the ischiatic artery, and terminates upon the semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and adductor muscles. The circumflex arteries also anastomose with the arteries of the periosteum. Professor Scarpa has bestowed much pains in describing and in representing this anastomosis. Vid. his Tab. 2d, affixed to his book Sull Aneu- risma. The branches proper to the periosteum,-are de- rived from the external circumflex, which enters the cruralis muscle, and which anastomose with other branches which come under the vastus in- ternus muscle. About the middle of the thigh, a considerable branch is derived from thearteria profunda, which is distributed upon the periosteum, and M'hich di-

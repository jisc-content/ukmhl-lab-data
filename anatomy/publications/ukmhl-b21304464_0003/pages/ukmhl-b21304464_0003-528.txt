APPENDIX. 500 “ Fig. 2.—represents a calculus from the kidney. The figure was taken before a section had been made of it. When divided, it was found to be composed of two kinds of matter. The whole exterior chiefly consists of uric acid. It only dif* fers from the preceding in physical properties, be- ing harder, more compact, and not apparently cry- stalline. The nucleus which the section exhibit- ed, is of a nut-brown colour, and consists of con- centric layers, thin, hard, and brittle. This nu- cleus is principally composed of uric acid, of oxalat of lime, and phosphat of lime. ** Fig. 3.—represents a uric calculus containing a little extractive matter, and about 4 percent, of mixed phosphat and oxalat of lime. It is a con- geries of very small crystals. “ Fig. 4.—represents a calculus, the chemical qualities of which are very similar to those of the last, and the proportions of the constituent parts much the same. The texture is different externally, the fracture is earthy, and internally resinous. “ Fig. 5.—represents a calculus taken from the bladder of urine. It is remarkably hard and brittle. On its exterior surface, as the figure ex- hibits, there is the appearance of a crystalline ar- rangement in the form of cubes. 1 he calculus con- sists of concentric coats very slightly adhering to-

OF THE PORTIO MOLLIS. 191 without any such appearance of fibres and net- work, as we might expect to observe from the name retina, which has been so long and univer- sally given to it; whereas, in the ear, fibres and the continuation of an intricate net-work can be seen distinctly in the semipellucid part of the la- mina spiralis, and as far as to its outer edge. “ I have, therefore, in my Lectures, long ob- served, that the term retina was improper when applied to the nerve spread out on the bottom of the eye, and had been given, not in consequence of accurate observation of the structure, but from a common favourite theory of anatomists, which supposes that the brain and nerves consist of fibres. In the ear, the term may be, with great propriety, applied to describe the appearance of the branches of the portio mollis, in their course on the lamina spiralis. “ At the outer part of the lamina spiralis, the nervous fibres and net-work become much less evident; and, upon the continuation of these membranes, on the inner sides of the gyri of the cochlea, the nerves seem to terminate in a semi- pellucid pulpy substance, very like to the retina of the eye.” Sound, according to the experiments of my Fa- ther, is as rapidly communicated through water, as through air; and thus the branches of the portio mollis distributed upon the cochlea and semicir- cular canals, are affected by the tremulous move-

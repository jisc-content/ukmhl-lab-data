103 ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.* Of Ganglia of Nerves. There are communications between a number of nerves; and where these communications take place, there is generally an enlargement or gan- glion. The ganglia are little flattened bodies connected with the nerves, consisting chiefly of medullary matter, which are different in size and shape in different nerves, and even in the same nerve, as in the sympathetic. All ganglia seem to be similar in their struc- ture. Many nervous cords may be traced on the sur- face of the ganglion, from their first attachment to the ganglion, till they have parted from it, without any substance intervening of a different texture from that of the nervous cords elsewhere. The nerves in their course upon the surface of the ganglion divide into smaller nerves, and are again collected into larger cords, in such a manner, that every nerve that comes out from the ganglion, consists of fibres from two or more of the nerves which enter the ganglion. The nerves within the ganglia retain their joint- ed appearance. The cords which come out from the under end cf a ganglion, are generally larger than those G 4

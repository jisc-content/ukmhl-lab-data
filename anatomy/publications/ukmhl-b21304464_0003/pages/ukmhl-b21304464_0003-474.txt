44S OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. In suspicious cases, how far may we conclude that the child was born alive, and probably mur- dered by its mother, if the lungs swim in water ? “ First, We may be assured that they contain air. Then we are to find out if that air be gene- rated by putrefaction. “ Secondly, To determine this question, we are to examine the other internal parts, to see if they be emphysematous or contain air ; and wc must examine the appearance of the air-bubbles in the lungs with particular attention. If the air which is in them be that of respiration, the air- bubbles will hardly be visible to the naked eye ; but if the air-bubbles be large, or if they run in lines along the fissures between the component h- buli of the lungs, the air is certainly emphysema- tous, and not air which had been taken in by breath- ing. “ Thirdly, If the air in the lungs be found to be contained in the natural air-vesicles, and to have the appearance of air received into them by breath- ing, let us next find out if that air was not per- haps blown into the lungs after the death of the infant. It is so generally known that a child, born apparently dead, may be brought to life by inflating its lungs, that the mother herself, or some other person, might have tried the experiment. It might even have been done with a most diabo- lical intention of bringing about the condemnation ©f the mother.”

10 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Of the Ligaments of the Bladder. There are two ligaments proper to the bladder, which extend from the symphysis pubis, to the upper part of the neck of the bladder, and to the prostate gland. The upper ligament of the bladder is composed of the umbilical arteries, urachus, and of the re- flected peritoneum. The urachus of the adult appears fibrous, of a white colour, and extends from the bladder to the umbilicus, where it is lost, becoming insensibly of a very small size. It is generally solid, sometimes hollow ; and it is said by Littre, that the urine sometimes passes through it, and escapes at the navel, which only happens when the neck of the bladder has been obstructed. Haller informs us, that the urachus, as it pas- ses along the umbilical chord, may be filled with mercury, for an inch and a-half. It then divides into a number of filaments,, which are lost upon the umbilical arteries. The urachus of quadrupeds passes along the chord to the allantois. The under ligament of the bladder of urine, ex- tends from each side of the neck of the bladder and prostate gland, and is fixed to the inner side of the symphysis pubis.

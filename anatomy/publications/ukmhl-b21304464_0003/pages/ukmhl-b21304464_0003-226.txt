198 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. The cuticle is connected to the subjacent mem- brane, by a number of small cellular threads, bloodvessels, and nerves. The cuticle covers every part of the true skin, except under the nails; and it is also reflected in- wards, and lines all the apertures, the nose, eyes, mouth, ears, pharynx, gullet, anus, urethra, va- gina ; and it also forms sheaths for the hairs. The cuticle is less prone to putrefaction than other parts of the body, and maybe taken off, in the form of a glove, from the hand of a putrid body. There are various furrows in different parts of the cuticle, which form figures with different angles on the back of the hand, and spiral lines on the toes. Chemical Analysis of the Cuticle. It appears from the experiments of Mr Hat- chett, that the cuticle, in all its properties, re- sembles coagulated albumen. Of the Nails. The nails make a part of the cuticle ; they con^ sist of fibres disposed in laminae, are transparent, insensible, excepting where they adhere to the skin ; and as the longest fibres of nails are outer- most, therefore the nails are thinner at their edges.

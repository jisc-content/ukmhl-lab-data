OF THE BRAIN. 125 The pia mater receives its blood froi^ the inter- nal carotid and vertebral arteries. Of tht Brain. The Brain, properly so called, which occupies the upper part of the cavity of the cranium, cor- responds in figure to the skull, to which it gives form. The upper part of it is generally of an oval fi- gure like an egg, cut lengthwise. It is composed of two portions, called by anato- mists Hemispheres, which are separated from each other by a deep fissure which receives the falx; and each of which is subdivided into lobes. Each hemisphere is arched above, irregular be- neath, and flat next the falx, and subdivided into three lobes. The anterior lobe rests upon the or- bitar process of the frontal bone ; the middle lol)e, which is separated from the anterior by the FOSSA SYLvii, occupies the cavity formed by the sphenoid and temporal bones; and the posterior lobe rests upon the tentorium cerebello superex- tensum. The surface of the brain is not uniform ; there are on it numerous convolutions, in the grooves between which the pia mater and small vessels of the brain are lodged. The under surface of the brain is much more irregular than the upper one, consisting of a num- ber of prominences.

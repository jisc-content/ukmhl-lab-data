CONGENITAL HERNIA OF THE FEMALE. 478 fibres of the oblique aponeurosis, to place itself, in so far as regards the course of the swelling, in the situation of a crural hernia.” There are many examples within my knowledge, where this mistake was never discovered till after the operation had been performed. Generally, it is unpardonable in a surgeon to confound the one disease with the other. He can never, indeed, be excusable, unless where the parts around the sac are so swelled and diseased, that there is no possibility of distinguishing Pou- part’s ligament. In congenital inguinal hernia in the female, I have found that the tumour, when it descended along the thigh, lay above the adipo-glandular fas- cia, so that it was more defined and superficial than in crural hernia. I may add, that in the case from which the annexed Plate was taken, no one could, previous to the exposure of the parts by dissection, have conjectured that the anterior side of the canal w’as so extensively wanting. This arose from the unusual resistance afforded by the oblique aponeu- rosis ; a resistance which prevented the descent of the sac along the thigh. Where the deficiency of the canal was great, and the hernia large and reducible, I have found that the finger could be made to follow the bowels, and so could be turned into the crural fo- ramen. Infants are frequently afflicted by umbilical her- nia.

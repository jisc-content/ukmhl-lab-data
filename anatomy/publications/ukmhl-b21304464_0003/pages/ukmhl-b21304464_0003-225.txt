OF THE ORGANS OF TOUCH. 197 CHAPTER VII. OF THE ORGANS OF TOUCH. Sect. I. ' OF THE SKIN. HE Skin, the common integument, is thicker on the outer than the inner part of the extremities of the body, and much thinner where flexion is required, or where it covers the more sensible parts of the body : it is also elastic. The skin consists of three, and according to Bayn- HAM, of four distinct membranes, viz. of the Epi- dermis or Cuticle, the Corpus or Rete Mucosum, of the True Skin, and of Baynhamâ€™s membrane. Of the Cuticle, The Cuticle is a transparent, insensible, lami- nated membrane, disposed in lines in many parts of the body, not uniformly thick, and perforated by the orifices of exhalent vessels, excretory ducts, and absorbent vessels, and by hairs: and the ves- sels of it are so small as not to admit the red blood.

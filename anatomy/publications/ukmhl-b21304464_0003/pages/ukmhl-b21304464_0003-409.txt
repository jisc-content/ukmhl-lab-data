’ LIGATURE OF AORTA^ 881 “ I was anxious to ascertain when even the aorta was tied, if the blood would still find its ■course by anastomosis. “ It is now more than two years ago that I opened the abdomen, by an incision of about three inches in length, close to its junction with the loins, and turning aside the peritoneum with my finger, I felt the aorta pulsating, and passing a blunt hook under it, easily put a ligature around “it. During the last winter, assisted by my friends Mr White and Mr Dean, two of our most pro- mising and intelligent pupils, I repeated the ex- periments, and have the honour of shewing to the Society the aorta tied and divided, the animal having survived the experiment, and maintained his usual health; the ligatures coming away as other ligatures upon arteries, and a successful in- jection having been made of the body, the anas- tomosing vessels are beautifully seen. These were sufficiently large and numerous to allow of a free injection of the femoral vessels. “ Some degree of weakness is produced in the hinder extremities by a ligature made upon the aorta ; but it is not sufficient to prevent the ani- mal from using them with great freedom, and would scarcely be observed by one who knew no- thing of the experiment. “ Previous to the animal being killed, the fe- moral artery and vein were laid bare j the blood

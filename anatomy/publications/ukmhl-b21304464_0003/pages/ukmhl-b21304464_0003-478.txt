It is probable, that the nutrition of the foe- tus is primarily or solely conveyed to it by the veins of the umbilical cord, whether we suppose these to be red or lymphatic* Sect. V* .OBSERVATIONS ON THE FORMATION AND USE OF THE PLACENTA. / The placenta, which consists of a foetal and maternal part, is formed by the junction of a por- tion of the filamentous substance of the chorion, with the plexus of vessels at the fundus uteri. This seems probable, by their being originally no placenta, by the decay of the filamentous sub- stance of the chorion, excepting that part of it which is attached to the fundus uteri, and also from analogy. In the cow, there are a number of glands on the inner surface of the uterus, from which a? milky liquor may be squeezed out; in these, there are excavations, into which the vessels of the cho- rion insinuate themselves ; thus the placentulae are formed. These placentulce may readily be sepa-

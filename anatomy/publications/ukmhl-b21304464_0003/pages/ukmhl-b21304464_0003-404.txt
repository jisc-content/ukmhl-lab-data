The third branch forms an arch, ' and corresponds with the external plantar artery ^ and gives branches to the muscles of the little toe, to the lumbric^les, interossei and transversalis pedis, and terminates in the muscles of the great toe. The Internal Plantar Nerve is situated on the inner side of the sole of the foot, and gives off branches to the abductor pollicis, flexor digi- torum brevis, and lumbricalcs muscles. • This nerve afterwards sends off four large' branches, which accompany the arteries; pass along the plantar sides of all the toes, excepting the little toe and the outer side of the fourth toe, 3nd terminate in tfie extremities of the toes.

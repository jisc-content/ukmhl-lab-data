' The word pterygium has been employed to denote a red-coloured membrane, of a triangular shape, which generally grows from the internal angle of the eye, and extends over the margin of the cornea ; the thickness also of the pterygium va- ries in different cases ; most frequently it resem- bles a thin vascular membrane ; at other times, it is like a fleshy tumour. . In consequence of inflammation, a dense lymph is sometimes effused between the layers of the cor- nea, which constitutes the disease called albugo or Icucoma. Fleshy excrescences sometimes grow from the cornea, and with hairs growing from the centre. Fungous tumours are sometimes, though rarely, connected with the cornea. Pustules, which appear like yellow or red spots, somewhat elevated above the surface of the cor- nea, have been observed ; and these are generally attended by inflammation, and an enlargement of the bloodvessels of the eye. . These pustules advance to suppuration ; and in their centre there is often a white chalky substance. Blood or purulent matter have in some cases been collected between the layers of the cornea: when pus has been effused, the disease is termed fungus, and appears like a spot of a yellow colour.

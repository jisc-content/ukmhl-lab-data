182 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. the fossa that lodges the condyle of the lower jaw. This muscle is fixed into the long process of the malleus within the tympanum, where it rests upon the edge of the fissure between the pars squa- mosa and peirosa. This muscle tends to draw the malleus oblique- ly forwards towards its origin ; consequently, the mcmbrana tympani, is made less concave, or is re- laxed. Tenm' Tympani. This muscle arises, by a very small beginning, from the cartilaginous extremity of the Eustachian tube, just where it begins to be covered by the pars petrosa and spinous process of the sphenoid bone, near the entry of the artery of the dura mater ; from thence running backwards near the osseous part of the Eustachian tube, it forms a very distinct fleshy belly, below a thin osseous plate, between the pars squamosa and labyrinth; and sends off a slender tendon, which makes a turn in- to the tympanum, along with the nerve called choi'- da tympani. This muscle is fixed into the posterior part of the handle of the malleus, a little lower than the root of its long process. By this muscle, the malleus and membrana tymr pani are pulled inwards tgwards the pars petrosa,

421 PLACENTA OR AFTER-BIRTH. D d 3 Sect. IX. OF THE PLACENTA OR AFTER-BIRTH. The placenta is a flat organ; to the touch spon- gy ; in form nearly circular; and about an inch in thickness in its centre, when its vessels are dis- tended. The placenta becomes gradually thinner towards its circumference â€¢, and, when fixed to the uterus, is concave next the child, and convex towards the womb. The surface of the placenta, which is at- tached to the womb, is very tender, and lobu- lated. The umbilical cord is not attached exactly to the centre of the placenta, but rather nearer to its edge ; and from the umbilical cord, the vessels spread out upon the surface of the placenta, from which they pass into its substance. The placenta is generally fixed to the fundus uteri. The large umbilical bloodvessels are disposed on that part of the placenta which is next the child; and on the side next the uterus, bloodvessels may be observed passing between the placenta and uterus.

OF THE POSTERIOR ILIAC ARTERY, 351 iftternus muscles, towards the crista of the os ilium; and anastomoses with the lumbar arteries, and circumflex of the os ilium. Sacr^ Laterales.—There are three or four of these arteries ; they sometimes take their rise from the ilio-lumbar, or from the gluteal artery. These arteries descend on the side of the os sacrum, communicate with the sacra media ; and branches of this artery enter the fora- mina of the os sacrum, and supply the cauda equina. The course of the vesical, hemorrhoidal, and pudendal arteries, which are branches of the iliaca posterior, has been already described. Arteria Glutea.—The gluteal artery, is the largest branch of the posterior iliac ; it takes- its rise from the back-part of the trunk of the iliac, passes backwards through the upper part of the great notch of the os ilium, and is subdivided into two great branches, a superjicialy and deep-seated branch. The superficial passes betw^een the gluteus maxi- mus, and medius; to both of which, it gives many branches. This artery anastomoses with the sa- cral artery. The deep-seated branch, placed under the mid- dle of the gluteus muscle, divides into Superior and Inferior branches. The branches of the Superior, are distributed on the dorsum of the os ilium, and the gluteus me-

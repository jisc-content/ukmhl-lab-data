Sometimes the cells are small and numerous, but at other times there are only two or three large cells, which communicate with each other. In quadrupeds, there are large cells or cavities communicating with the tympanum, and supply- ing the place of mastoid cells. The tympanum of the skeleton communicates w'ith the Vcst 'ible by an oval-shaped aperture, which in the recent body is filled up by membrane, and lodges the base of one of the chain of bones which passes across the tympanum. Thfe tympanum also communicates with a half of the turns of that part of the ear, call- ed Cvchlea^ by a round aperture, which is placed obliquely backwards and outwards^ and which in the recent body is shut up by a membrane. Of the Chain of Bones* There are four bones stretched across the tym- panum â€¢, the Malleus, Incus, Os orbiculare, and Stapes, which are covered by the periosteum, and articulated to each other by capsular- liga- ments. The Malleus or Hammer, consists of a round head, a small neck and handle, and two little pro- cesses.

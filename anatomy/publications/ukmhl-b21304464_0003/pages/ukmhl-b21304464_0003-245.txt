[ 217 ] CHx^PTER I. ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE MEM- BRANES OF THE BKAIN, CEREBELLUM, AND SPINAL MARROW. Sect. I. OF THE ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE DURA MATER. The Dura Mater has sometimes been inflamed; it then acquires a pink colour; and there are many small vessels on its surface, which pass into the in- ner table of the skull. Small pieces of bone are occasionally formed upon the dura mater ; these bones are commonly very thin, and have ragged edges. Cauliflower-like excresences sometimes grow from the dura mater, where a violent blow upon the head has been received. The portion of the skull over the tumour is de- stroyed, and the excrescence from the dura mater appears as an external swelling under the scalp.,

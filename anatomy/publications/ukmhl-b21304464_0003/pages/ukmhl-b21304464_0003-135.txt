OF THE BRAIN AND NERVES, 107* Sect. VI. ^ CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF THE BRAIN AND NERVES. Very few chemical experiments have been made Upon the substance of the brain. Thouret* and Fourcroyf are the only che- mists who have made experiments on the brain. Brain consists of Phosphate of Lime ; Soda ; Ammonia. Dr T. Thomson has observed, â€œ These facts are sufficient to shew us, that, exclusive of the small proportion of saline ingredients, brain is composed of a peculiar matter, differing in many particulars from all animal substances, but having a consider- able resemblance in many of its properties to -albu- men. Brain has been compared to a soap ; but it is plain that the resemblance is very faint; as scarce- ly any oily matter could be extracted from brain by Fourcroy, though he attempted it by all the contrivances which the present state of chemistry- suggested, and the alkaline portion of it is a great deal too small to merit any attention * Journal de Pliys. tom. xxxviii. p. 329- + Ann. de Chim. tom. xvi. p. 282. + System of Chemistry, vol, v. p. 540.

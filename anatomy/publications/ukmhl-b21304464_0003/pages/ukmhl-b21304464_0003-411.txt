383 LIGATURE OF THE AORTA. The third left. lumbar came off from the right side of the aorta immediately below the oblitera- tion. The fourth and fifth on each side came off near the bifurcation of the aorta. The latter are very small, and do not seem to have made any anasto- moses with the other branches. The epigastric arteries seemed to be enlarged. The knowledge which we have gained respect- ing the anastomosing arteries, has paved the way to a new and improved method of treating wound- ed or diseased arteries, by which many patients, who, twenty or thirty years ago, would have been suffered to die, are now rescued from the brink of the grave*. * My Father’s experiments upon the arteries of animals, the ebservations of Mr White of Manchester, upon the humeral artery, of Mr Astley Cooper, upon the arteries of the extre- mities, have shewn how much the lateral anastomosing arteries are enlarged when the main trunks have been obstructed. Mr A. Cooper’s history of the dissection of a limb, on which the operation for popliteal aneurism had been performed, is too important to be omitted. He has observed, “ The femoral ar- tery, which is necessarily obliterated by the ligature, was here converted into a cord from the origin of the arteria profunda down to the ham. The whole of the popliteal artery was also changed into a similar substance; and thus the natural channel of the blood from the groin to the lower part of the knee was entirely destroyed. The muscles, therefore, which usually re- ceive bloodvessels from the femoral artery, as the sartorius, the rectus, and the vasti, had no branches but from the arteria pro- funda and circumflex arteries; and the articular arteries from

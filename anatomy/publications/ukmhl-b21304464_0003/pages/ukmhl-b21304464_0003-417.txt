I procured, and still preserve the aneurismal sac, which began at the top of the anterior femoral artery, immediately below where the external iliac, after sending off the epigastric artery, divides into its anterior and profunda branches. ** From a manuscript copy of my Lectures, which was taken in short-hand, in the winter 1770-1, by Mr Thorburn, the following passage is extracted : “ We are led from these facts, to make the ap- plication to other cases; and, particularly, I may allege, that there is much probability we should be able to save the arm or the leg by making ligatures upon their arteries^ near to their very beginnings ; for water, squirted into them, passes freely by their lateral communications to their lower parts. But the chance is somewhat less in the legs, as a greater size of member must be nourished by si- milar, but smaller vessels. In one case, which you will find in the Physical and Literary Essays, the sides of the humeral artery were found grown together, by the compression of an aneurismal sac, the lateral branches probably dilating as the aneu- rismal tumor formed and increased.” I should be extremely culpable, and at the same time unjust, did I not bestow the praise that is due to those distinguished surgeons, Messrs J.

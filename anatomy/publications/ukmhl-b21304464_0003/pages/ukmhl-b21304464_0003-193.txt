165 OF THE EYE-LASHES. Of the Cilia or Eye-Lashes. The cilia or eye-lashes are implanted on the edges of the eye-lids. Those of the upper eye-lid, which are longer than those of the under eye-lid, are bent upwards, and those of the under eye-lid are turned downwards. These hairs prevent dust or other extraneous bodies from getting into the eye-ball. Muscles of the Eye-Lids. Naso-Palpebralis, or Orbicularis Palpebrarum. The fibres of the orbicular muscle are arranged parallel to the edge of the eye-lid ; and the fibres of the muscle are concentric. This muscle, arises by a tendon, from the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, from the orbitar process of the same bone, and from the internal angular process of the os frontis; its fibres are intermixed with those of the frontal and corrugator and levator labii superioris muscles, and the outer surface of the muscle adheres to the skin of the eye-lids. The fibres of this muscle decussate each other at the external angle of the eye. L 3 %

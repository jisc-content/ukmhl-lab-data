PROGRESS OF FOETUS. 429 â€¢i ning of the third month, or a little after, the fingers and toes are formed. Professor Soemmering has remarked, even in the foetus between the third and fourth month, the greatest difference in the thorax of the sexes, That , the male is not only longer and more conical, but much more prominent ih respect to the abdomen and pelvis, than the female. The female chest is not only shorter, but also wider above the fourth rib ; below, it is more contracted, and therefore less conical ; and it is also farther distant from the pelvis, as a greater space intervenes between the last rib, and spine of the os ilium. He observes. That there is also a difference in the form of the head ; the head of the male is larger, but less rounded ; the occiput, besides, is a little raised. On the other hand, the head of the female is smaller, and more rounded. The occiput is scarce- ly raised. He also observes. That the arms of the male are a little longer than those of the female ; and the scapulae are larger and more prominent. The inferior extremities of the male, according to Soemmering, are more contracted, being adap- ted to the narrow pelvis, and the thighs are more slender. At the full time, the foetus is about twenty- two inches long, and weighs from six to eight pounds.

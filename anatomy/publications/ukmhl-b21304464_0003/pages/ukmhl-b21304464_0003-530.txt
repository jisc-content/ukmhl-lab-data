APPENDIX. 502 Fig. 8.—represents a concretion of a yellow colour, which also had occupied the pelvis of the kidney. Fig. 9.—represents a concretion which had been lodged in the bladder of urine, and which had been impressed by another concretion con- tained in that organ, Explanation of Plate xxxviii. “ Fig. 1.—represents the section of a mulberry calculus, taken from the bladder of urine. It is very hard and tough, and is composed of concen- tric layers, between which there are dark lines, as if of coagulated blood. The rugged irregular globular form, is peculiar to this species, and is alone sufficient to characterise it. Its constituent parts are chiefly oxalat of lime and uric acid, with a little phosphat of lime. The oxalat of lime is insoluble in water, in alkalies, and only with diffi- culty in muriatic acid. It is inflammable, and the result of its combustion, is quicklime, or carbonat of lime, according to the degree of heat applied. The mulberry calculus is easily analysed. Pot- ash will dissolve the uric acid, acetic acid will take up the phosphat of lime, and the chief con- stituent part, the oxalat of lime, will remain undissolved.”

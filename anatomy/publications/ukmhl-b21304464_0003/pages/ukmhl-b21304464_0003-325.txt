BRANCHES OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 297 This artery takes its rise from the outer side of the trunk near to the middle of the arm, and passes downwards to the external condyle of the humerus, supplying the neighbouring parts with blood. The branch which supplies the os humeri, cal- led nutrient, is sent off about the middle of the humerus. The humeral artery then passes towards the middle of the elbow-joint; and, about an inch below the joint, divides into its two great branches, the radial and ulnar arteries *. The Ulnar Artery passes behind the pronator teres, the flexor muscles of the hand, and then be- tween the flexor sublimis and profundus digito- rum. It sends upwards a considerable branch, call- ed recurrens ulnaris, wâ€™hich is placed under the flexor muscles, and supplies the anterior and in- ner side of the elbow-joint, and anastomoses above the internal condyle with the smaller branches of the arteria profunda humeri. The artery then passes along the ulna, giving off several small branches to the fore-arm. The next branch has been called the interossea posterior, as it perforates the upper part of the in- terosseous ligament. From this artery, there is * The palm of tlie hand is supposed, in the following de- scription of the arteries, to be in front.

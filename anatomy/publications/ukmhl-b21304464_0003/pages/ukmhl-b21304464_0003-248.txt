220 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. attain a prodigious size, and the substance of the brain, bounding the ventricles, becomes unnatu- rally thin, and is not so readily torn as in the healthy state. But when only a small quantity of water has been accumulated, I have generally remarked, that the brain was softer, of a paler colour, and more easily torn than in the healthy state. Blood or serum is sometimes effused between the dura and pia mater, or within the substance of the brain or ventricles of that organ ; and in some in- stances the blood is fluid, but in others firmly coa- gulated. When the blood has been effused in consequence of external violence, the brain around the effused blood retains its healthy structure ; but in other cir- cumstances, the brain around theâ€™effused blood, loses its healthy organization, and frequently acquires the consistence of custard. When blood has been effused upon the surface of the brain, I have sometimes observed a number of small exostoses, growing from the internal table of the skull; and, in a few cases, canals pas- sing from the place where the blood had been ef- fused, filled by yellow coloured serum. Hernia of the brain sometimes occurs, from an aperture in the skull, the consequence of mal- conformation, disease, or trephining.

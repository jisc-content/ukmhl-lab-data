Outlines of anatomy. 72 The external organs of generation of the fe- male are supplied with blood by the branches of the pudic artery. The nerves of these organs are derived from the pudic nerves. The lymphatic vessels of the external female or- gans of generation pass into the lymphatic glands of the groin ; and those at the sides of the pelvis pass into the iliac,"and then into the lumbar lym- phatic glands. Conclusion. * Trom what has been already stated, it follows,, that the testes and ovaria are the most important parts of the organa of generation. The semen, secreted by the testes, is probably propelled through its long course by a muscular power, (though the muscular fibres of,the ducts be so small as to escape our imperfect sight,) and is carried to the vesiculae seminales, within which it remains till it is required.* In consequence of the return of the blood from the penis being prevented, the penis is erected ; the corpora cavernosa penis, and corpus spongio- sum urethrae are distended, by which the penis acquires the necessary firmness ; and by it the semen is introduced into the vagina of the fe- male.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY, 4-20 ' ■ Sect. VIII. OF THE NAVEL-STRING OR UMBILICAL CORD. The umbilical cord, the medium of connec- tion between the placenta and child, is not uniform as to thickness and length. It is generally thinnest near to the placenta, and about two feet long ; but in some cases does not exceed a foot, and in others is four or five feet long ; and sometimes makes two or three turns round the child’s neck. The umbilical cord con- sists of two arteries and a vein, and a thick jel- ly, which are enveloped by the chorion and am- nion. The arteries and vein of the cord are disposed in a spiral direction. In some very rare instan- ces there is only one artery. In some cases, the umbilical arteries are not dis- posed in the usual manner, but are for some way straight, and then form a sort of knot, one of the arteries being longer than the other. Owing to the thick jelly which envelopes the arteries aud vein of the umbilical cord, and the spiral course of its arteries, pressure, or the stretch- ing of the navel-string does not readily interrupt the flow of blood through its bloodvessels.

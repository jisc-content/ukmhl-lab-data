179 INTERNAL PARTS OF THE EAR. Sect. IL OF THE INTERNAL PARTS OF THE EAR. The internal ear consists of two cavities and their appendages. The J'ympanum, which is filled by air, is of an irregular figure, and about half an inch in breadth. This cavity is separated from the Labyrinth by a plate of bone, in which there is a projection, which divides the tympanum into an Anterior and Poste- rior part. There is also within the tympanum a â€¢projection formed by the aqueduct of Fallopius. There are two other eminences, one at the upper and fore part of the tympanum, for lodging the mus- cle called Tensor Tympani; and another behind the oval-shaped hole for the passage of the muscle called Stapedius. The tympanum communicates with the poste- rior fauces by the Aristotelian or Eustachian tube^ which begins at the upper and fore part of the tym- panum ; and runs forwards and inwards. This tube is like a trumpet in form, being narrow next the ear, and bony ; but much wider next the throat, and composed of cartilage. This tube is lined by a vascular membrane.

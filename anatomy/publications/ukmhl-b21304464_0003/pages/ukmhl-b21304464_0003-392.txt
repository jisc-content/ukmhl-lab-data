OUTLINES OF ANATOMF. r S64 In this course, this artery gives off the follow- ing branches : The recurrent, after it has passed through the interosseous ligament, which is spent upon the muscles of the* upper part of the leg, and which anastomoses with the inferior articula- ting artery of the knee-joint: A number of small branches to the muscles on the fore-part of the leg : 1 he external internal malleolar arteries, which supply the ancle-joint and neighbouring part of the tarsus : The tarsal arteries, which run along the ex- tensor digitorum brevis ; The metatarsal artery, which runs towards the root of the little toe. The continuation of the artery proceeds between the extensors of the great and smaller toes ; and the principal part of the artery passes to the sole of theâ€™ foot between the metatarsal bones of the great and second toes. There are a few branches detached from the ar- tery before it reaches the sole of the foot, which are distributed upon the metatarsal bones of the toes. The Posterior Tibial Artery is situated un- der the soleus muscle ; it divides, about an inch below the rise of the tibialis antica, into the Tibial and Fibular arteries. The Fibular is the smaller of these branches ; it runs down the leg along the fibula, between the

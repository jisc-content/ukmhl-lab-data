62 OUTLINES 6r ANAtbMY.' I of the body and neck of the womb, are not invest- ed by the peritoneum, but are in immediate con- tact with the bladder of urine. The tubes connected with the fundus uteri, cal- led Fallopian or uterine, the bloodvessels and nerves of the womb, are also included within the dupli- cation of the peritoneum. The broad ligament above described, is fixed into the sides of the pelvis, which is thereby di- vided into an anterior and posterior chamber. The broad ligament is subdivided into an an- terior and posterior part; in the former of which the fallppian tubes are lodged ; in the latter, the ovaria, and their ligaments. There are also round ligaments, proper to the uterus ; these arise from the fundus uteri, extend obliquely downwards, and pass into the inguinal canals, and terminate in tire groins. They are cords of a pale red colour, composed of longitudinal fibres, of cellular substance, blood- vessels, and nerves. These ligaments separate into several threads, which are fixed to the mons veneris, and labia externa. In some women, there is a canal formed by thfe peritoneum, which lies over the broad ligaments, and into which the bowels sometimes descend *. • •* Vid. my Morbid Anatomy of the Gullet, Stomach, and Intestines, p. 517.

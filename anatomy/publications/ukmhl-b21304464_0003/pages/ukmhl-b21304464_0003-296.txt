OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Â£68 This artery is placed between the under jaw- bone, and the external pterygoid muscle, and then ascends towards the back-part of the antrum maxillare ; and from it are derived the following branches : A branch which enters the cavity of the tym- panum by the fissure of Glasser ; a branch which passes through the spinous hole of the sphenoid bone, and is distributed upon the middle of the du- ra mater. A branch of this artery enters the under-jaw along with the third branch of the fifth pair of nerves, and is distributed upon the under jaw and teeth, and then comes out at the anterior mental hole, to be distributed on the incisor teeth, and muscles of the chin ; and anastomoses with the in- ferior labial artery. Several small branches of the internal maxillary artery are spent upon the pterygoid muscles, alve- olar processes, teeth, and antrum. A branch of the internal maxillary, passes in the canal under the orbit; supplies the fat in the bottom of the orbit; passes out at the fora- men infra-orbitarium, and then divided into many small branches, which communicate with the branches of the fascial artery. The Palato-Maxillary Artery, which passes through the foramen palatinum posterius, is distri- buted on the palate ; and a branch of it some- times passes through the foramen incisivum to the nose.

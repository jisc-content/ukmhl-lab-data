OF THE CILIARY PROCESSES. 147 The Optic Nerve describes a tortuous course in the orbit, and is contracted where it enters the sclerotic coat, in which there are a number of small holes. The optic nerve enters the eye-ball rather near- er to the nose than the axis of the eye-ball ; and is expanded into a very delicate pulpy substance, which is nearly transparent in the eye immediate- ly after death, called by anatomists Retina. The retina consists of a thin plane of medullary matter, which extends as far forwards as the greater dia- meter of the capsule of the crystalline lens, between the choroid coat and capsule of the vitreous hu- mour *. The retina is not of an uniform thickness ; it is considerably thicker at its posterior than at its anterior part. The retina is very thin, especially under the ciliary processes, to which it is glued, and by which it is impressed, so as to have a striated ap- pearance. Some anatomists are of opinion, that the retina is not an expansion of the optic nerve ; 1st, Be- cause, upon making a section through the optic nerve, it may be observed rather to be contracted than expanded ; Â£d, Because in some animals there is a projection of the optic nerve, and no connec- tion is said to exist between it and the retina, as in the haddock.

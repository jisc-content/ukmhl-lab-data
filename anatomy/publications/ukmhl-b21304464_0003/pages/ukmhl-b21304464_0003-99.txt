OF THE EXTERNAL PARTS. 71 cellular corpora cavernosa, which are contained in a ligamentous membrane, and take their origin from the rami of the os ischium, and ^re capable of distention, and are provided with muscles for that purpose. The clitoris is attached to the sym- physis pubis by its proper suspensory ligament; and like the penis, possesses great sensibility. The corpora cavernosa of the clitoris are con- siderably longer than the body of it. From the frenum clitoridis, descend the labia interna or nymphce, on each side to the oritice of the vagina. These are various in size in different women, and in different nations*. The nymphae are very vascular organs, inclosed In a duplication of skin ; consisting chiefly of ser- pentine branches of the pudic artery, and corres- ponding veins. On separating the nymphae, an orifice presents itsell about an inch below these, viz. the orifice of the urethra; and immediately under it, the orifice of the vagina is placed, which in a virgin is surround- ed by the membrane called hymen. Below the orifice of the vagina, and between it and the transverse fold of skin, by which the lower parts of the labia externa are united, there is a small cavity, somewhat in figure like a boat, which hence has been called the fossa navicii- lai'is. E 4 * The nymphae are very large in tlie Hottentots.

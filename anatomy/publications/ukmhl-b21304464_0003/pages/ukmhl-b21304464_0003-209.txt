* INTERNAL PARTS OF THE EAR. 181 The head of the bone is turned upwards and inwards, and forms an angle with the neck of the bone, and is laid along the membrana tympa- ni, to which it adheres. The Incus or Anvil, consists of a body, and two crura, of equal length. The shorter crus extends backwards, and is joined by ligament to the edge of the mastoid opening. The Os orhiculare is articulated with the long process of the incus. The Stapes, so named from being like a stirrup, is placed horizontally, and is divided into a head, crura, and base. The base of the bone is of an oval shape, and its edges correspond with those of the fenestra ovalis. The longest crus of the stapes is placed backwards. There are three muscles by which the chain of bones is moved. The La.vaior Tympani. This muscle arises, by a small beginning, from the extremity of the spinous process of the sphe- noid bone, behind the entry of the artery of the dura mater ; after which it runs backwards, and â€¢ a little upwards, along with the nerve, called chor- da tympani, in a fissure of the os temporis near M 3

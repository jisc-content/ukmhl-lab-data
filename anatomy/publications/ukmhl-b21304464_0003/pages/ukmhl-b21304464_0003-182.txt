OtJTLlNES OF ANATOMY. 1^4 cularly, that the rays of light cannot be refracted on entering the cornea in fishes, and therefore that their crystalline lens, which is not more dis- tant from the retina than in land animals, must possess much greater power of refraction,—ha- ving led me to suspect an error in the common opinion, and to put this highly curious point of physiology to the test of experiment, I discover- ed, That thfe spherical nucleus of the crystalline lens of the cod, which, in specific gravity, is to water nearly as 6 to 5, and to common white glass as 3 only to 10, collects the light so much 'more powerfully than water or glass does, that its focus is not more than one-sixth part of its dia- meter distant from its surface ; whereas the focus of the rays coljected by a glass sphere, is at the distance of one-fourth of the diameter of the sphere ; and the focus of the rays collected by a Sphere of water, is distant from it one-half of its diameter. “ OTi performing a similar experiment with the human crystalline lens, I found, that the focus, of parallel rays of light falling on it, is at the dis- tance of three-eighths of an inch from its cen- \ tre. “ But, although this shews, that its powers are far inferior to those of the lens of the fish, and *0, cl.

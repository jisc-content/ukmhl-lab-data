distribution of the arteries, &c. 379 but also common to the brain and heart; those organs upon which life more immediately depends : and likewise to the liver, salivary glands, pan- creas, and other secretory organs. 4th, Anastomoses are also essential to the re- generation of parts which have been injured or detached. There is an increased action of vessels in every part of the body, which is in a state of growth ; the bloodvessels of that part become larger, and more freely and frequently communicate with each other, than in other parts of the same or- gan. By means of anastomoses of vessels, a part, which has been separated, adheres and grows ; thus, a bone adheres to a bone, a muscle to a muscle, a nose may be supplied, or a tooth may be transplanted. By the inosculation of vessels, even parts of different structure are united ; thus, for instance, Mr Du Hamel found, that the spur of a cock may be inserted into the comb of the animal, where it continued to live and to grow ; and Mr Hunter found, that a human tooth adhered to a cock’s comb *. * Upon this very curious subject, the reader is refeired for further information to the works of Garengeot, Traite des Operat. tom. iii—Taliacotius.—Vesalius, Chir.

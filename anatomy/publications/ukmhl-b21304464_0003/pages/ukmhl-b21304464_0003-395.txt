artehies of the inferior extremities. 367 .Sect. II. OF deviations as to the course of the ar- teries OF THE INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. The arteries of the Inferior Extremities are much more constant as to their course, than those of the Superior Extremities. The femoral artery commonly divides into_ its two great branches, the superficial femoral, and the arteria profunda femoris, about two inches be- low the crural arch, or Poupart’s ligament. In some cases, however, I have seen the profunda detach- ed immediately under Poupart’s ligament, and, but very rarely, as low as three inches below Poupart’s ligament. There is also considerable variety as to the origin of the circumflex arteries, which sometimes take their rise from the superficial femoral artery. The tibial artery sometimes takes its rise lower than usual, sometimes as low as the middle of the tibia.* The posterior tibial artery is sometimes smaller than the fibular artery. Mr A. Burns, has stated, that he had observed one or other of the tibial or fibular arteries alto- gether wanting.

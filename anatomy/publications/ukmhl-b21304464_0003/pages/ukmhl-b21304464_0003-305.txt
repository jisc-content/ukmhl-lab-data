ARTERIES Of THE HEAD AND NECK.. 277 it has reached to the top of the breast, it divides in- to two great branches, the Right Carotid and Right Subclavian arteries ; but in some cases the arteria innominata is much longer, and runs along the front of the windpipe. In the annexed Plate xliii., a singular distribu- tion of blood-vessels is represented ; the carotids came off by separate trunks from the aorta, as also the right and left subclavian arteries; and the subclavian of the right side passed behind the trachea. In a few cases, both carotid arteries take their rise from the arteria innominata, and the left ca- â€™rotid crosses the windpipe considerably above the -Sternum. The common carotid artery sometimes divides opposite to the fourth or fifth cervical vertebra, into the external and internal carotids ; and in some cases, (as in a, specimen I saw in the Mu- seum of Mr A. Burns qf Glasgow,) the com- mon carotid, instead of dividing into tw.o great branches, divides into a number of small branches. Mr Burns shewed me another preparation, in which the carotid artery, opposite to the styloid pro- cess, divided into two large arteries; the internal ca- rotid, and a trunk which is common to the temporal and maxillary arteries ; and there were several , branches sent off instead of the external caro^ tid.

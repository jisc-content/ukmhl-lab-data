Of the Orifice of the Vagina. The orifice of the vagina is about half an inch below the symphysis pubis, and surrounded and contracted by its corpus spongiosum, and its sphincter muscle. Its aperture in virgins is very small, being contracted by the hymen, a semilu- nar-shaped membrane, the concave part of which looks upwards, and in the upper part of which there is an aperture, through which the menses are discharged. There is much Variety as to the thickness of the hymen in different women ; sometimes it assumes a circular form ; is not per- forated ; and the menses are retained within the vagina.

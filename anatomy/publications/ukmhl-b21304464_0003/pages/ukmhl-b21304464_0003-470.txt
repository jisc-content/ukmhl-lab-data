The circulation of the blood of the foetus in utero is adapted to the state of the lungs; the foetus does not breathe, and a very small portion of blood passes through these : It is diverted from the lungs by the foramen ovale and canalis arteriosus. The foetus is attached to the mother by means of the navel-string, and placenta. The navel-string is composed of two arteries and a vein, which, with a quantity of jelly, are inclosed by the membranes, called chorion and am- nion ; and the flow of blood through these arte- ries of the navel-string cannot readily be inter- rupted either by pressure, or by stretching of the cord. By means of the umbilical vein, which takes its rise from the interior part of the placenta, by many branches, the blood is returned to the body

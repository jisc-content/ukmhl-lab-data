DISEASES OF THE HYMEN. S9 Inflammation of the labia, sometimes gives rise to ulceration. The labia externa are subject to ulcers of diffe- rent descriptions. Of these, what has been named the irritable sore, is perhaps the most distressing. Venereal Texcrescences, and polypi, sometimes grow from the labia. The labia externa, are sometimes the seat of scrofulous and scirrhous tumours. The bowels have been sometimes protruded into the labia pudendi, in cases of hernia*. Sect. II. HYMEN THICKENED. The hymen is sometimes so thick, that it can- not be ruptured, and at the same time imperforat- ed ; and hence the menses are retained behind it, which sometimes occasion a considerable tumour. The nymphae are occasionally much elongated, protruded beyond the labia, and covered by an insensible skin. The carunculce myrtiformes, sometimes attain an unnatural length, and create much pain. * Vid. the Morbid Anatomy of the Gullet, Stomach,

BONES OF THE FOETUSi 433 The younger the embryo, the greater the pro- portion of the head to the rest of the body. The bones of the foetal cranium are united by membranes instead of sutures. The anterior and uppermost parts of the pieces composing the frontal bone, and the anterior and superior portions of the parietal bones, are unossi- fied at the period of birth : so that a quadrangular portion of the brain is covered by membrane on- ly ; and as a heaving is perceived at that place, it has been called fons pulsatilis, or bregma ; and the word anterior is added to distinguish it from an unossified portion at the back-part of the head, of a triangular form, situated where the sagittal and lambdoidal sutures are united ; this last has been called the posterior bregma. There is likewise an unossified portion at the fdre and also at the back-part of the pars squamosa of the temporal bone. The bones of the cranium of the foetus, bear a large proportion to those of the face, which are small, owing to the want of the sinuses and the teeth. The cavity of the thorax, is proportionally larger than in the adult; and, according to Pro- fessor SoEMMERiNci, is differently formed even at birth. The pelvis is proportionally smaller in the child at birth, and its shape is very different; the dis- tance between the ossa pubis and os sacrum, being greater than from side to side. VOL, III. E e

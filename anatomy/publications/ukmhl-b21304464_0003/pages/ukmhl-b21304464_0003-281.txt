Small encysted tumours, filled hy fat and hairs, are sometimes met with in the cellular sub- stance. Fleshy and hard tumours, which have been cal- led sarcomata, are occasionally lodged in the 'cel- lular membrane. A worm, called Gordius, and also Lice, may be enumerated among the diseases of the skin and cellular membrane. The fungus hamatodes has sometimes been ob- served in the cellular substance; this disease some- times begins as a distinct tumour, and sometimes as a general swelling of the part, and the veins in the neighbourhood of it are much enlarged ; the swelling is to the touch, soft and elastic ; and on the progress of the disease, bursts, and a dark fungous excrescence rises from the centre of it, which discharges a good deal-of blood. Upon dissection, a substance like brain is found to occupy the greater part of the tumour.

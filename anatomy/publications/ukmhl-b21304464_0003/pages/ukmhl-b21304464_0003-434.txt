406 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. of the lower pa^t of the spinal marrow are distri- buted, become paralytic, which is often followed by a suppression of urine, nuitibness, and shrink- ing of the thigh. The spinal marrow may, like the brain, be 1 much injured by the pressure of extravasated blood, or by any other cause which diminishes the diameter of the spinal canal, as by inflamma- tion of the dura mater lining it, by exostoses, curvature of the spine, by fractures, or disloca- tions of the vertebrae. The spinal marrow sometimes becomes very hard, having a cartilaginous consistence, and the investing membranes of that place become very red and inflamed. ' Scrofulous tubercles grow from the spinal liiar- row. Dropsy may also be enumerated arhong the dis- eases of the sheath of the spinal marrow. , The dropsy of the spinal marrow is frequent- ly complicated with hydrocephalus, and some- times with an imperfection of the spinal pro- cesses of the vertebiae. In the latter case, there is sometimes a free communication between the spinal marrow and the head ; hence the tumour in the back becomes larger when the head is erect, but smaller considerably upon placing the head lower than the rest of the body.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMF. 9it Tubercles of different sizes, r consisting of a solid white substance, sometimes grow from the uterus, and these are either imbedded within ithe uterus, or grow from its outer surface. The uterus is occasionally displaced, or in a state of prolapsus ; and the displacement sometimes takes place to such a degree, that the uterus protrudes beyond the external parts^ which is named the procidentia uteri. The uterus has been in a few instances, so much displaced as to fill an inguinal hernia*. > Lieutaud f has described the uterus as being in a few cases changed into an earthy substance; and masses of bone have been found within the cavity of the uterus. Sect. V. â€™ s Organic derangements of the ovarium. Dropsy is the most frequent organic derange* ment of the ovarium. The ovarium, when dropsical, consists of one bag, or of a number of small cysts, which do not communicate with each other ; and the fluid which fills these, is in some cases clear and limpid, but in others yellow and ropy. * Such a kind of hernia has been described by Senertus, Ruysch and Lallement. t Tom. 1. p. 323.

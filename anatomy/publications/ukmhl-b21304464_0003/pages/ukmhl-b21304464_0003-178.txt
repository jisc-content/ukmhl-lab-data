1-50 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. trie around the pupil; the other set issues from the pupil, as from a centre, to the circumference of the iris. The iris, according to my Father, is a muscular organ. “ Its appearance is, in all respects, so evi- dently muscular, that I think there can be no doubt of its being the sphincter of the pupil; And I can only account for its having escaped the observation of Dr Haller and Dr Wrisbero, by supposing that they had not washed off the black paint, which covers and conceals it, as well as the red vessels of the iris. “ On the inner and anterior part of the iris, and on the whole of its posterior part, the fibres are disposed like radii ; and, if they are muscular, they are well situated for dilating the pupil. But these have many more blood-vessels in their com- position, and have much less the appearance of muscular fibres, than the oval fibrous organ I have described on the fore-part of the iris. My success in the ox naturally prompted me to examine the human iris with greater attention than I had formerly bestowed on it; and in this I found, with equal satisfaction, a very distinct sphincter muscle ; but somewhat differently dis- posed ; for in man it occupies the innermost part of the iris, or forms a ring immediately surround- ing the pupil, which is equally well seen on its fore and back parts, and makes about one-fifth part of the breadth of the iris.

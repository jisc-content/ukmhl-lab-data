MUSCLtS OF THE EAl. 177 upwards, forwards or backwards; and by their com- bined actions, in the intermediate directions. There are five small muscles on the external cartilage of the ear. The Tragicus, which arises from the middle and outer part of the concha, at the root of the tragus,; and is inserted into the point of the tragus. This muscle is said to pull the ij'agus a little forzvardsi The Antitragiciis arises from the internal part of the antitragus ; upon which it turns forwards, and is inserted into the. tip of the antitragus. By this muscle, the tip of the antitragus is turn- ed outwards, and the extremity of the anlihelix is depressed. The 'Iransversus Auris arises from the promi- nent part of the concha, on the dorsum or back- part of the ear, and is said to stretch the scapha. Two muscles have been described under the names, Helix major and minor: the former ari- ses from the anterior part of the helix, and is fix- ed into the helix ; and the latter from the under and fore part of the helix, and is fixed into the helix. The Concha is a large cavity under the antihelix, which is divided by the helix into two parts; the inferior of which leads to the meatus audito- rius extcrnus. These muscles are so insignificant, as to have little or no power in pulling the helix dotvnwards. VOL. III. M I

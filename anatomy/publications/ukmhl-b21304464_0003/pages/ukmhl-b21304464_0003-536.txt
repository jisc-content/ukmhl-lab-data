APPENDIX. 508 of magnesia, of ammonia, and water, in the follow-, ing proportions; 35 phosphat of lime. 13 phosphat of magnesia. 52 water and ammonia, and slight traces of animal matter. 100 â€œ It is unusual to meet with a calculus of so great a size, and of such a composition as the present. Its composition is particularly instructive, espe- cially in a therapeutical point of view. As it con- sists of three different kinds of matter possessed of such opposite qualities, it would have been nearly impossible to have removed it from the bladder by means of chemical agents.^ Suppose the bladder capable of bearing, uninjured, the ac- tion of acid and alkalies, what would be the con- sequence of the introduction of either ? Were an acid injected when the stone was fully formed, it might dissolve the external ammoniaco-mag- nesian phosphat, which is soluble in the nitric and muriatic rfcid ; but it would not remove any of the uric acid, which is acted upon only by alkalies ; on the contrary, it is probable, that the acid would occasion a fresh deposition of uric matter, and reinlargement of the stone. But, suppose an alkali, instead of an acid, was first injected, the worst effect might be produced; and there is good reason to believe, that the deposition of the triple

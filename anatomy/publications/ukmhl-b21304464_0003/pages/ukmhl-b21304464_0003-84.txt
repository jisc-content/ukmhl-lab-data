56 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY^ that bowel is much distended, it rises slightly on the prostate gland, and is thus liable to be cut in the lateral operation of lithotomy. There are ten or twelve ducts leading from this gland, which open obliquelyinto the urethraaround the orifices of the seminal ducts, which are common to the vasa deferent ia, and vesiculae seminales. These ducts, w-hich, with their exceedingly mi- nute cylindrical beginnings, compose the greater share of the prostate gland, were filled with wax by my Father, upwards of forty years ago. and < have since been annually demonstrated in his Cour- ses of Lectures, along with an engraving of these ducts, executed by Mr T. Donaldson in 17b2. The prostate is covered by cellular substance; by a plexus of veins ; and by a portion of a few scattered muscular fibres, which Albinus has des- cribed under the name compressor prostata, but which constitute a portion of the levator ani muscle. This gland is largely supplied with arteries, veins, nerves, and lymphatic vessels. Of Cowper's Glands. Cowper’s glands are two small bodies, of a light red colour, one of which is situated on each side of the bulb of the urethra. They are about the size of a pea. Each of them has a separate ex- cretory duct, about half an inch long, which per- forates the membranous part of the urethra with a degree of obliquity. Sometimes these glands •are not to be found.

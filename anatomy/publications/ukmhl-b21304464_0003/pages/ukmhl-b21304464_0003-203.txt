external parts or the ear. 175 Baeans' of the skin, ligaments, and muscles, to the temporal bone. Different parts of it are distinguished by diffe- rent names. The cartilaginous part has been called the ala^ or wlng^ to distinguish it from the soft pendent part underneath, called the lobe. The outer border of the cartilage, has been call- ed the helix; and the semicircular part within it, the antihelix. The moveable cartilage which shuts the exter- nal passage, is named the tragus; and an eminence at the extremity of the antihelix, opposite to this, the ahtitragiis. There is a small cavity between the helix and antihelix, called innominata; and another cavity somewhat like a boat between the limbs of the antihelix, called /ma navivularis. There are certain muscles fixed in this carti- lage of the ear for elevating it, drawing it for- W’ards, and drawing it backwards ; but few' persons are capable of throwing these muscles into action. There are a few thin muscular fibres implanted upon the cartilage of the ear, which are calculated for stretching it •, but I believe I may say, that few, or perhaps none, can throw these muscles in- to action. Certain names have been appropriated by ana- tomical authors to these muscles, descriptive of their situations on the external cartilage of the ear.

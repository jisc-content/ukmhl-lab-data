9 BLADDER OF THE ADULT. breadth of a finger, or a finger and a half, inter- venes between the beginning of the urethra and the lowest part of the bladder. In the healthy state, a space, equal to two or three inches, intervenes between that part of the bladder which is covered by the peritoneum, and the ossa pubis. In some cases, the bladder rises much higher. I visited a man, whose bladder was then as high as the navel; and I was informed, that a little before, it had been still higher, and that J2 lbs. of urine had been drawn off from it. It sometimes, though very rarely happens, that the peritoneum is attached obliquely in respect to the bladder. The posterior part is more expanded, and bound- ed by a kind of cul de sac, which covers part of the vesiculae seminales, and vasa deferentia ; and between the vesiculae, the bladder is in contact with the rectum, and connected to* it by loose cellular substance, in which many veins are lod- ged. The internal surface of the bladder is smooth, when that organ is distended and besmeared by mucus. There is a part of the inner surface of the blad- der, which has been called trigone; it is rather whiter than the rest of the bladder, and bounded before by^ the urethra, and laterally by the open- ings of the ureters.

2 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. mediate vicinity of the kidneys, the right kidney is placed rather lower than the left one. The kidneys are about five or six inches long, and in figure resemble the kidney bean, and with the concavity inwards, they are elongated from above downwards, convex outwardly, and broader in the upper end, to which a gland of a very particular nature, called the renal glands is con- nected, the concave basis of which is turned to- wards the kidney. The kidneys are retained in their situation by ligaments, which are formed by a reflection of the peritoneum. The peritoneum passing from the right kidney to the liver, is called the right liga- ment, and on the left side the peritoneum goes to the spleen, and is called the ligament of the lejt kidney. The section of the kidney exhibits two difler- ent substances, viz. a cortical vascular part, and the tubular uriniferous, and a series of conical shaped bodies, which hang into the infundibula or calices, and the cavity called pelvis. The cortical part is externally smooth,; of a pale red colour, and intimately connected to the proper membrane of the kidney ; is three or four lines in thickness ; and it sends in processes which fill up the intervals between the tubular uriniferous part. On tearing the cortical part, small grains are felt in it, or seen after throwing a penetrating injection into ihe renal arteries; thence called acini of the kidney *. * Vid. Plate xxxvi.

Niy<.VES OF THE ARM. 317 root of the thumb, and gives -also branches to the* back of the hand; 9th, The Nervus Cutanews so named, from its situation under the skin, passes down along the inner and fore part of the arm. In its course downwards, it supplies the biceps muscle and coraco-brachialis muscle : and at the elbow- joint, or a little higher, is divided into txvo branches^ which have been named, from their situation on the outer an^ inner sides of the arm, external and ■internal. The external passes behind ; and its branches pass before the median basilic vein, (Vid. Plate xlv.,) and afterwards suddenly divides into a num- ber of very small nerves, which are spent upon the elbow-joint and fore-arm. * The internal branch, which is rather smaller than the preceding, crosses over the basilic vein to the inner- side of the elbow, and terminates on the inner side of the fore-arm. Vid. Plate xlv, and xlvi. 10th, The CuTANEUs Internus of Wrisberg. The Cutaneus Internus of Wrisberg also takes its rise from the axillary plexus. This nerve, which is smaller than the former, divides^ into two branches ; the larger descends along the triceps, and disappears at the under part of that muscle ; the former tvinds round to the back-rpart of the arm, and i§ spent upon the triceps.

A plexus of nerves is derived from the coeliac plexus, and from the great sympathetic nerve which envelope the renal arteries and their branches. The spermatic nerves, which follow the same course as the spermatic artery, are derived from the renal and aortic plexuses, and form the second lumbar nerves. The pudic nerves, which are branches of the sciatic nerves, follow the same course as the pudic arteries. The principal nerve of the penis, is called the dorsal nerxe ; it is placed between the correspond- ing artery and vein, and running along the dor- sum penis, terminates on the glans.

Â« The larger veins of the brain do not follow a similar course with the arteries, but pass between the convolutions of that organ, and terminate in the venous sinuses, with their orifices directed obliquely forwards, lest the blood .should flow - . backwards from the venous sinuses, into the small- er veins of the brain. The principal venous sinus has been named the superior longitudinaly the situation of which has been above described. It divides opposite to the middle of the occipital bone into the lateral sinu- ses. The blood from the lateral ventricles, cho-. roid plexuses, corpora striata and septum lucidum, flows into the iorculor IJerophili, and from it into the beginning of the lateral sinuses ; and from the lateral sinuses into the internal jugular veins. The veins of the dura mater accompany the arteries of that membrane, and terminate in the external or internal jugular vein; and a few of the veins open into Uie sinuses of the brain.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE ARTERIES, &C. 385'. at my particular request, he drew up the follow- ing statement; “ The external circumflex artery was considerably larger than usual for the supply of branches to the muscles on the fore- part of the thigh, but it had no branches for the new circula- tion. The obturator artery did not appear larger than usual, and although much pains were taken to trace any enlarged com- municating branches between the ischiatic arteries and profunda, yet no vessels capable of receiving coarse injection could be found.” In proof of what has been affirmed, I have subjoined the history of a case, published by my late Uncle: “ A patient with an aneurism was brought to St George’s Hospital. At this time the tumour was large, and extended' itself far down the arm; it had still a pulsation, and the pulse at the wrist was feeble and weak. The physicians and surgeons of the hospital, upon examining the case, were of the same opinion with Mr Fordyce*; they thought the tumour was situated too high up to attempt any operation, and advised only mild palliatives and anodynes to be given. After this, the swelling gradually increased, and its pulsation as gradually di- minished, so that at last only a tremulous motion could be observed ir it; the pulse at the wrist grew daily wetiker, and at last ceased entirely. In the end of November, or the beginning of December, tlie tumour began to rise in the middle, and at last bursting on the £9th of December, the patient died immediately of a profuse haemorrhage. “ Next day the'body was opened in presence o( all the phy- sicians and surgeons of the hospital. The axillary artery was • found to open into the large ancurismal sac, which extended above two-thirds down the arm. This sac was filled with a large lamellatcd polypous concretion, entirely of the same na- VOL. III. Bb

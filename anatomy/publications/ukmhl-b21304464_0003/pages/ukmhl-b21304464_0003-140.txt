OUTLINES or ANATOMY. 112 energy by which the nerves perform these two very opposite functions. The following experiments throw considerable light on this interesting subject. 1. A solution of opium in water applied to the surfaces of the brain and spinal marrow of a frog, renders the muscles of the extremities of its body paralytic, almost instantaneously. 2. The water of lauro-cerasus, poured into the stomach of a pigeon, kills it instafltaneously. 3. The poison of the viper, introduced into the vein of the leg of a frog, instantly gives pain, 4. The dividing the spinal marrow, before the poison of the viper is inserted into the vein of its leg, prevents it from killing the frog, 5. After cutting out the heart of a frog, and thus putting an end to the circulation of the blood, if a solution of opium be applied to the surface of the encephalon and spinal marrow, or poured in- to the abdomen, the mitscles of its limbs are depri- ved of their contractile power. It is evident, that, in these several experiments, the poisons act upon the muscles, by the medium of the nerves, and not by the medium of the blood, as Fontana has supposed. When, therefore, a poison poured into a vein, or the heart of an animal, produces similar effects on the muscles, we may safely conclude, that these are not owing to the action of the poison upon the blood, but to its action on the nerves of the blood-

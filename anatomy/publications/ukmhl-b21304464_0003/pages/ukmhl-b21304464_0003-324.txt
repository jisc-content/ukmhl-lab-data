2S6 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. % around the fore-part of the neck of the os humeri, and distributes its branches to the biceps, coraco- brachiulis and deltoid muscles, to the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint, and to the perios- teum of the bone. The axillary artery leaves the axilla, advances towards the front of the arm, and pursues its course, covered by the tendinous aponeurosis of the arm, along the inner side of the biceps, and over the brachialis muscle; and is then named hu- meral artery. The smaller branches sent from this artery go to the biceps, coraco-brachialis and brachialis in- ternus muscles. A branch, named the Profunda Humeri, takes its rise near to the insertion of the teres major muscle into the humerus \ it follows a spiral di- rection^around the os humeri, between the long and short head of the triceps muscle ; then comes out at the back of the arm, and divides into two branches, which communicate with reflected branches of the radial, ulnar and interosseous arteries. The smaller branches of this artery pass up- wards, and anastomose with the other branches of the scapulary and humeral arteries. There are secerol smaller arteries sent off from this artery to the neighbouring muscles in its course along the os humeri. I'he next considerable branch has been called Profunda Inferior or Minor.

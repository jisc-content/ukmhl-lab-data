OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. sU The vagina also receives blood from the pu- dic, and vesical arteries. The PuDic Arteries are derived from the branches of the posterior iliac, called hypogastric^ or from the ischiatic arteries. "* These arteries pass through the under-part of the notch of the os ilium, and then between the sacro.* ischiatic ligaments, to the inner sides of the tubero- sities of the ischia, from which, in the male, they advance along the inner side of the ascending branch of that bone, behind the transversalis muscle and crus penis. In the above course, there are se- veral branches derived from the trunk of the ar- tery ; 1st, The perineal artery, which ascends between the accelerator urinae and erector muscles, supply- ing with blood the fat, muscles and skin of the perineum. • 2d, The principal artery of the penis, which divides into two great branches ; one of which runs along the dorsum penis, and another artery subdivides into the arteries proper to the corpora cavernosa penis, and which supply also the corpus spongiosum urethrae *. . * Dr Camper’s Engravings of the Pelvis give very accurate representations of the course of the Pucjic Artery.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY, ^30 Sect. VI, ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE IRIS. The iris is frequently inflamed ; it loses its heal- thy colour, becomes thickened, and the pupil is much contracted. This inflammation is usually attended by an in- flammation of the sclerotic coat; and when the disease is violent, lymph is effused on the anterior surface of the iris, and also between it and the crystalline lens ; by which the light cannot reach the bottom of the eye. From violent internal inflammation of the eye, the pupil has been completely closed ; the iris is rendered immoveable, and assumes a radiated ap- pearanqif. It may not be improper to add, that in conse- quence of a wound or ulcer in the cornea, the iris has been sometimes protruded forwards through the cornea. Sect. VII. OF AMAUROSIS, OR PALSY OF THE OPTIC NERVE. The palsy of the optic nerve is not commonly attended by any manifest organic derangement of the optic nerve.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. S9^ and ulnar branches in the middle of the humerus> or In the axilla, is the most important. A surgeon, therefore, while operating for aneu- rism, should bear in mind the above irregularity ; as also, that a brunch of the humeral artery, as in fig. 1. of Plate xLiv., sometimes is situated im- mediately under the skin, and over the tendinous aponeurosis of the arm, and may be mistaken for a vein, or wounded in opening one of the subcu- taneous veins. Deviations from the common distribution of ar- teries, are more common in the inferior than in the superior extremities. The attention of the surgeon should be directed chiefly to the division of the femoral artery into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris, which, supposing the body to be erect, usual- ly takes place, about two inches beneath the crural arch.

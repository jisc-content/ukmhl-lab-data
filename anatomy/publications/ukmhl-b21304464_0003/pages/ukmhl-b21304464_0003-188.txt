160 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. The sixth muscle, the inferior oblique, takes its rise from the fore-part of the orbit. These muscles which have been called straight and oblique muscles, are not exactly so, on account - of the shape of the orbit. The above muscles terminate in broad thin ten- dons, which are inserted into the sclerotic coat un- der the tunica adnata, about one-sixth of an inch from the cornea. By the straight muscles, the axis of the eye is directed towards different points; and by their combined action, the eye-ball is directed towards any intermediate point, or in a circle by the suc- cessive action of these muscles. Rectus Superior, or Levator Oculi. This muscle passes nearly horizontally below the levator palpebrae superioris and optic nerve ; it is the thinnest of the recti muscles, and takes its rise from the upper part of the foramen opti- ciim, and is fixed into the sclerotic coat, about one-fifth of an inch from the edge of the cornea. By this muscle, the eye-ball is raised. Rectus Inferior, or Depressor Oculi. This muscle is situated in the lower part of the orbit, and takes its rise from the lower part of the

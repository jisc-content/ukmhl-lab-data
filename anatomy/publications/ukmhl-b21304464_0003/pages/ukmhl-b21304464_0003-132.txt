OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 104 which enter the upper end ; but there are excep- tions to this rule in the course of the sympathe- tic nerve. Every nerve connected with a ganglion appears to contain cords, running in opposite directions; ascending, for instance, and descending ; or where nerves are connected to the upper, under or outer part or side of a ganglion, (which is the case of the thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic nerve,) the nerve at the side appears to consist of cords, which divide into ascending and descending cords, that are combined with the cords which compose the upper and under nerves *. My Father, after having described with great minuteness the structure of the ganglia, has ob- served : “ Upon the whole, all the nerves which issue from ganglia, seem to be formed by a com- • bination of threads from many sources ; and, be- sides this, the nerves, in their passage through a ganglion, seem to receive new energy from the vascular matter of the ganglion. Hence we understand the reason why ganglia art most numerous in the nerves of organs oj chief im- portance ; as in those of the heart, or of the intes- tinal tube. Thus, the intestinal tube receives its nerves from the eighth pair, and perhaps from al- most all the spinal nerves. If the first pair of spinal nerves had run to the uppermost part of that canal, and so on, without the intervention of * Vid. Nervous System, p. 54. and Plate xx. fig. 1. B.

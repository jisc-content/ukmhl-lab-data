PROGRESS OF FOETUS. 421 The human foetus has been described as being B line in length when first perceptible. v By the seventh week, the fcEtus has been stated to be equal to a bee in size *, and, about the eighth week, to be as long as a kidney-bean, and in form to resemble two ovals of unequal size, joined by a neck. Baron Haller, has bestowed great pains in order to discover the growth of the. foetus in utero. He has stated, that it increases during the first month to a bulk 300,000 times greater than its original size *, during the second month, the in- crease is forty-eight times the size it had at the end of the first; from which time, to the ninth month, there is at an average an increase of fifteen times for each month. The younger the foetus, the larger the ovum is, and the greater the proportion of the head to the trunk. Still the foetus does not increase in size in proportion to its age. In the second month, it has been said to grow more slowly, in the third more quickly, in the fourth more slowly ; but from the middle of the fourth month to the sixth it grows more rapidly; and between the sixth and ninth month, more slowly. The embryo in the first and second month, is a little bended. In the fourth and fifth, from the addition of its extremities, it seems folded up.

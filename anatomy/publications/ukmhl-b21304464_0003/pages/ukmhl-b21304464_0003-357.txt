329 OF THE THORACIC DUCT. The upper intercostal rierms, give off branches which supply the muscles on the upper and outer part of the chest, and also branches which pass along the branches of the internal mammary ar- tery to the mammae. ' The lower intercostal nerves, supply the muscles of the thorax and of the abdomen. ^ Sect. V. OF THE LYMPHATIC .VESSELS WHICH ARE PROPER TO THE HEART AND LUNGS. Of the Thoracic Duct. This duct is formed by the lymphatic vessels of the inferior extremities, and by the trunk form- ed by the lacteal vessels. These trunks unite, and form the receptacle of the chyle, an oval-shaped bag, which is placed up- on the second lumbar vertebra. The thoracic duct passes upwards, close to the spine at first behind the aorta ; it then perforates the diaphragm behind its right crus ; reaches the thorax, and is placed between the aorta and vena azygos ; and at last terminates at the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian veins of the left side of the body.

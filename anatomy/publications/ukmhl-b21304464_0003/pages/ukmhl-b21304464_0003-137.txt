FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVES. 109 3. By experiment, it may be proved, that the nerves, without the aid of the brain,\ can excite nervous energy for any given length of time. My Father cut out the whole spinal marrow of a frog, which is lower than the third vertebrae of the head ; he kept the animal for several weeks, un- til the wound in the teguments and vertebrae had closed. The animal did not recover the feeling nor vo- luntary motion in the hind-legs. He then passed a gold probe through the body of the animal, at the upper part of the pelvis, across the sciatic nerves, and in contact with them. He then laid the animal on its back, upon a plate of zinc, and found, on touching the zinc with the gold probe, that the muscles of the hind- legs were violently convulsed. From this experiment it follows, that the ner- vous energy remained in the nerves for weeks af- ter the communication between them and the brain had been intercepted. He prosecuted the experiment, by confining the animal in a vessel made of zinc, which he fil- led half full of water, after he had twisted toge- ther the opposite ends of a gold probe ; and in this manner, every time the animal altered the position of its body, which it was enabled to do by means of its fore-legs, the gold probe alternate- ly touching, and being separated from the zinc, threw the muscles of the legs into convulsions.

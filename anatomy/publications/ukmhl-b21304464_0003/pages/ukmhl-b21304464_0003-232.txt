outlines OF ANATOMY. 204- The orifices of the absorbent vessels of the skin of fishes may be demonstrated, as my Father discover- ed in the skate. The absorbent vessels of that fish are not provided with valves; and hence any fluid thrown into their larger trunks passes readily into the smaller branches, and flows out by a number of orifices, which are regularly disposed upon the surface of the skin *. The skin is an organ of secretion. There are a number of vessels which open upon the surface of the skin, through which the matter of insensible perspiration passes. The perspirable matter may be perceived, by confining the arm in a clear glass vessel. The quantity of matter discharged by the insensi- ’ ble perspiration, is, according to the experiments of Sanctorius, Keil, Rye, Robertson, Se- chin, and others, greater than all the other ex- cretions. • ' The quantity of the insensible perspiration va- ries in different climates ; the warmer and drier the climate, ccoteris paribus^ the greater the quantity of the perspiration. The matter contains water; according to Cruick- SH ANK, an oil; and according to Berthollet, the phosphoric acid. There are also the ducts of a number of glands, which are placed under the skin, and open up- on its surface ; these secrete a concrete cerumi- nous matter, which may be squeezed out from the * Vid.

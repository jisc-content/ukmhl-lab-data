ANALYSES OF CALCULI. 605 - “ The nucleus, as represented in the figure, is of a dark brown colour; it is hard and brittle ; its form is globular, and its outline rough and ragged. It is a good example of the mulberry calculus. “ The next substance, that which surrounds the nucleus, is of a nut-brown colour, and very brit- tle ; though not hard, its fracture is resinous, and its lustre is slightly resinous; its general appear- ance is very similar to that of roll-sulphur ; its form is completely oval, and its outline quite equal. It is a perfect specimen of the uric cal- culus.^ ^ “ The third-snbstance, the envelope of the whole, is white, soft,- tough and fibrous; presenting in its section traces of crystallization, and on its exter- nal surface evident crystals. This is an equally good instance of the ammoniaco-magnesian cal- culus. “ I shall briefly describe the experiments I made to ascertain the composition of the calculus j and I shall commence with the nucleus. “ It did not effervesce, and was onlypartially dis- solved in muriatic acid, and a considerable time was required for the full effect to be produced. Ten grains of it in powder, digested in diluted mu- riatic acid for two days, were dissolved, with the exception of three grains, which put into a solution of caustic potash, soon disappeared, a few floccu- ^ li only remaining;. Hcnce it may be concluded, that these three grains were chiefly uric acid, and the undissolved part was probably extractive mat-

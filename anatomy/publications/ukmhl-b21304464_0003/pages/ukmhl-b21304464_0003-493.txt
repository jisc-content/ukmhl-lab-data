AtiMENTARY CANAL OF FOETUS. 465 months, during which the meconium was voided along with the urine. On opening the body, the colon, and the greater part of the intestines, appeared very much distend- ed, and filled with solid excrements. The rectum was three inches in length, and ended: in a canal four inches long, which passed under the prostate gland, and opened into the membranous part of â€˜ the urethra. At the place of the insertion of the canal, there was a cherry-stone, which the child had swallowed, and which had prevented the pas- sage of the excrement through the urethra. Fif th, The rectum, in a few very rare cases, has terminated in the vagina, and the faeces are dis- charged by the vagina. .The opening into the vagina is commonly so much contracted, that the child lives only for a few days, on account of the retention of the faeces. But some have lived for some years. Van Swieten * has related the history of a young woman, who had such a malconformw- tion. Benivenius f has described the case of a wo- man, who discharged her faeces by the vagina for sixteen years. * Vid. Comment, in Boerhaave, Aph. 1340. t Vid. Obs. Med. cap. 86. ' Gg VOL. III.

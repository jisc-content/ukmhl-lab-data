176 ' OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. The muscles which move the whole external cartilage of the ear, are the following : Temporo-Auricularis, or Attolhns Aurem. This muscle arises by a curved line from the tendinous aponeurosis of the temporal muscle, and is fixed by a broad tendon to the eminence on the inner side of the antihelix. By this muscle, some persons can raise the external cartilage of the ear. Zygomato-Auricularis, or Anterior Auris. This arises from that part of the aponeurosis of the temporal muscle, which covers the middle of the zygoma; it passes backwards and downwards, and is fixed into the inner side of the helix. By this muscle, the helix is drawn forwards. Mastoido-Auriculares, or Retrahentes Aurem. This muscle consists of three parts, which arise from the posterior part of the root of the mastoid process, and are fixed into the projection which corresponds with the hollow of the concha. These muscles tend to stretch the concha. By the above muscles, the cartilage of the ear is drawn:

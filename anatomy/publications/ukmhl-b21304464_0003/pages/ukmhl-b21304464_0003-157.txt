129 OF THE BRAIN. The thalami nervorum opticorum taf the cor- responding lateral ventricles, are united by a soft transverse plate of medullary substance, called the commismra mollis. Under the commissura mollis, there is a deep fissure between the thalami nervorum opticorum : this is the third ventricle ; and from it, the funnel- like cavity, called infundibulum, runs downwards and forwards to the pituitary gland. > The pituitary gland, is a small oblong-shaped body, inclosed by the dura matter, and situated in the sella sphenoidalis: it is greyish without, and medullary within. There is a transverse medullary chord imme- diately befoi'e the anterior crura of the fornix, which runs through, and unites the corpora striata, called anterior commissure; and at the posterior part of the third ventricle, under the root of the pineal gland, there is a similar, though rather , shorter chord, called the posterior commissure. In each lateral ventricle, there is a plexus of small arteries and veins, called the choroid plexus. The choroid plexuses are expanded upon the thalami nervorum opticorum, pineal gland, and corpora quadrigemina In each plexus, there is a large venous trunk, which is directed backwards; and the venous trunks of the corresponding choroid plexuses, unite behind the pineal gland, and their contents are discharged into the torcular Herophili. In the descending cornua, besides the posterior crura of the fornix, there are two rounded bodies, 'VOL. III. I

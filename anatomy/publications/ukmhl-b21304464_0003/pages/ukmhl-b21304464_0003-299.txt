OF THE OCULAR ARTERY. 271 bitaria interna, and which anastomose with the branches of the internal maxillary artery, which are distributed upon the inside of the nose. There is also a branch called Supra-Orbiiar, or in some cases branches called Supra-Orhi- taria, of the ocular artery, which fill the fora- mina supra-orbitaria, and which are distributed upon the anterior part of the occipito-fronta- lis .muscles, the skin and muscles of the up- per eye-lid, and which anastomose with the ante- rior branches of the temporal artery. There are branches of this artery which supply the perios- teum of the os frontis, and frontal sinuses. The other, and smaller branches of the inter- nal carotid arteries, are distributed upon the optic nerves, the infundibulum, and the choroid plexuses. There are two other large branches of the In- ternal carotid artery, the Arterice Anteriores Cere- bri, and the Arterias Mediae Fossae Sylvii. The Arteri^ Anteriores Cerebri, are dis- posed in a parallel manner in respect to each other: they run forwards along the under parts of the an- terior lobes of the brain, and communicate by means of a transverse canal. Each branch is afterwards subdivided into two branches ; the smaller is spent entirely upon the anterior lobes of the brain ; the larger is reflected backwards along the corpus callosum, and is di- vided into a great number of small branches, which anastompse repeatedly with tl^e smaller

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 144, The cornea, which is more or less convex in different individuals, and in different animals, is hot exactly circular. When the cornea is too convex, the rays of light are collected into a focus before the retina, and such persons are short-sighted ; but, on the other hand, when the cornea is flatter than com- mon, the foci of rays proceeding from near ob- jects are formed beyond the retina, and such per- sons are long-sighted, and can only see objects held at a considerable distance from the eye. In the healthy eye, there are no vessels on the cornea capable of receiving red blood. The cornea has been supposed to have a great effect in refracting the rays of light; because the rays at the cornea pass from the rarer medium, the air, in^o the more dense medium the aqueous fluid. Of the Choroid Coat. The Choroid Coat is much thinner than the sclerotic ; of a brown colour ; internally villous; largely supplied wdth bloodvessels and nerves; and connected to the sclerotic only by fine cellular membrane, by bloodvessels and nerves, excepting at its fore part near to the iris, where these coats are connected by the ciliary ligament. The brown colour of this coat is derived from the paint which covers its surfaces, shining through

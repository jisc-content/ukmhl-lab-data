294 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. superior: it passes transversely behind the origin of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and then through the notch in the superior costa of the scapula, and di- vides into many branches, which are distribu- ted upon the dorsum of the scapula^ and also gives branches to the shoulder-joint. The Superior Intercostal Artery, is also a branch of the subclavian ; it descends over the headsof the first and second ribs, and gives branches to the gullet, and spinal marrow. Branches of this artery are distributed upon the first and second in- tercostal spaces, and anastomose with the inferior intercostal arteries. The subclavian arteries pass behind the cla- vicles, and over the first ribs, into the axillae, are surrounded by the axillary plexuses of nerves, lymphatic glands, and fat, and called Axillary- Arteries. The first branches of these, have been called 0 the External Thoracic, or Mammary arte- ries. The first from these, called ihoracicn superior, longa, and htimeralis, supplies the serratus, intercos- tal, and pectoral muscles; the second goes to the ax- illary glands, to the mammae, and the pectoral mus- cles ; and the third supplies the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint, and anastomoses with the scapulary arteries, and supplies the deltoid, greater pectoral, and subclavian muscles. A few of the smaller branches of this artery extend to the lowest

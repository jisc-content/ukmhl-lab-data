ALIMENTARY CANAL OF FOETUS. 463 In the second species, the membrane which ob- structs the rectum, instead of being situated ex- ternally, is internal, and may be felt by intro- ducing the finger into the rectum, especially when the child cries, as it yields to the impulse of the liquid meconium contained within the rec- tum. This membrane is in some examples thin, but in others of considerable thickness; and has been said by Trioen *, to be in some instances as hard as horn. This cause of obstruction cannot in all instan- ces be removed ; as though a perforation be made through the obstructing membrane, the rectum remains constricted. The third species of malconformation, is by no means so frequent as the first, as it proceeds from the unnatural contraction of the rectum. I have seen the rectum contracted to one-third Â«f its natural diameter, so that the meconium passed with great difficulty through it, or not at all; and the child dies in consequence of the ac- cumulation of the excrement within the intes- tines. This malconformation may in some cases be re- moved, by dilating the contracted rectum by a bougie ; and it is necessary to use the bougie for a considerable time, lest the contraction should not be completely removed, or should return. * Vid.

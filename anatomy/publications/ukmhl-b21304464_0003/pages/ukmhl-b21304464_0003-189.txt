MUSCLES OF THE EYE-BALL. l6i foramen opticum, and fixed opposite to the insertion of the former muscle into the sclerotic coat.^ By the above muscle, the fore-part of the eye- ball is depressed. # Abductor and Adductor Oculi. The eye-ball is provided with an Abductor and Adductor muscle, the former of which arises from the inferior and posterior part of the fisgure of the orbit, and is fixed into the eye-ball opposite to its outer angle ; the latter the shortest, thickest and straightest of the recti muscles, arises from the side of the foramen opticum, and is inserted opposite to the inner angle of the eye. By the abductor^ the eye-ball is pulled towards the temple ; by the adductor, towards the nose. Obliquus, Superior and hiferior. The former arises from the side of the foramen opticum ; its tendon included within a bursa, pas- ses through a cartilaginous pully, fixed behind the internal angular process of the os frontis \ it after- wards is reflected under the levator oculi, and is fixed into the sclerotic coat between the insertion of the levator oculi, and entrance of the optic nerve ; the latter arises from the anterior edge of the orbitar process of the superior maxillary bone, and is inserted into the sclerotic coat between the entrance of the optic nerve, and the insertion of the abductor oculi. By the superior oblique, the pupil is turned downwards and outwards, and by the inferior, up- wards and inwards. VOL. III. L

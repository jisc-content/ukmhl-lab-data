298 OUTLINIS OP ANATOMY. also a recurrent branch, which anastomoses with the branches of the humeral artery. The posterior interosseous artery is continued downwards to the back- part of the fore-arm, and its smaller branches supply the extensor muscles of the fingers. The interossea anterior is sent off below the posterior, and is considerably larger than it. This artery passes downwards along the fore- part of the interosseous ligament, and supplies the flexor digitorum profundus with blood. A little above the wrist, this artery perforates the interosseous ligament, and divides into branch- es, which anastomose with the smaller ramifica- tions of the posterior interosseous artery. The ulnar artery then sends off many small branches, which supply the wrist; and passing over the annular ligament, forms the superficial palmar arch, from which the following branches are sent off: three digital branches which run in the interstices of the metacarpal bones to the roots of the fingers, each is subdivided into two branches; one of these runs along the radial margin, and the other along the ulnar margin of the finger : all the fingers are therefore supplied from this source, ex- cepting the outer margin of the little finger, and the outer margin of the fore-finger. Towards the points of the fingers, the arteries of opposite sides freely communicate with each other, and form an intricate plexus of vessels.

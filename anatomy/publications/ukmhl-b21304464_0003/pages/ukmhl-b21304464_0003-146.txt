118 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. bable, in the highest degree, that the nervous energy is of the same nature in them, as in other animals, and that similar experiments exciting animal electricity, would prove, that the nervous fluid is very different from the electrical. In the next place. These animals are provided with very extensive machinery jjroper to them, and undoubtedly for the purpose of giving an electrical shock, and therefore we ought, instead of supposing, that the nerves which terminate up- on it, convey to it an electrical fluid, to suppose that thene. nerves serve merely to invigorate this machinery, and to enable it to collect electrical fluid ; for if the nervous fluid or energy had been electrical, these nerves should, without the inter- vention of any machinery, have conveyed their fluid to the surface of their bodies directly, in or- der to give the shock. Upon the whole, it appears that a slight elec- trical shock excites the energy of the nerves, and that a strong one destroys it ; and that there are no just grounds for supposing, that the nervous energy is of an electrical nature. Dr Monro senior, read the following theory in 1793, to Drs Hutton and Black ; but Dr Hut- ton dissuaded him from publishing it, although it did not seem to him then to be objection- able : â€œ Whence the active matter is derived, or from what cause it is put in motion, is indeed very dif-

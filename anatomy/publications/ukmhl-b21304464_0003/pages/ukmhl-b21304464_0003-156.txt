128 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. vous System, and also in his Treatise on the Brain, published in 1797 The under surface of the fornix is impressed by a number of grooves, disposed somewhat like the strings of a lyre. Upon the fornix being removed, a vascular web is exposed, which envelopes the Corpora quadrigemina. The latenl ventricles being ful- ly exposed, the following parts come into view. In the anterior cornu of each lateral ventricle, there are two very obvious projections, the Cor- pus Striatum, and Thalamus Nervi Optici. The corpora striata, are pyriform bodies, broad be- fore, and narrow behind ; and being composed partly of cineritious, and partly of medullary mat- ter, exhibit, when divided, a striated appear- ance. The Thalami Nervorum Opticorum intervene between the posterior parts of the corpora striata, and are of a whiter colour than the corpora striata. * " An oval hole, situated under the anterior part of the body of the fornix ; behind the anterior crura of the fornix and commissura anterior cerebri; on the fore-part of the joining of the choroid plexuses of the two lateral ventricles of the brain ; and over the fore-part of the third ventricle. Hence, at this place, the lateral ventricles of the brain communicate with each other and with the third ventricle.”—Treatise on the Brain, the ijyc, and the Ear, p. 22.

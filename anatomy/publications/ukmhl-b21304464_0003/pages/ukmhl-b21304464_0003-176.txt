OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 148 The axis of the eye-ball does not correspond with that of the orbit. The axis of the orbit is di- rected obliquely outwards, whereas the axis of the eye is directly forwards ; and the axes of the two eyes are parallel. • That part of the optic nerve which enters the eye-ball is insensible. My Father has observed : “ I found that the diameter of the object which disappears is very nearly equal to one-ninth part of our distance from it *, or, that, at the distance of nine feet from a wall, a circle one foot in dia- meter is lost. If, therefore, we suppose the hu- man eye to be one inch or twelve lines in diame- ter, and that the rays of light, issuing from the object, decussate about the centre of the crystal- line lens, which is nearly three lines behind the cornea, or nine lines from the retina,—the insen- sible spot on the bottom of the eye will be one line in diameter ; and with this calculation, I found that the actual measurement of the medullary part of the optic nerve agrees very nearly. “ I next found, that an object begins to disap- pear, when the point to which the eye is directed, is one-fourth of the distance of the eye from it; and hence, upon the supposition above stated, the axis of the eye-ball will be found to be two lines and a quarter from the outer side of the optic nerve, and two lines and three quarters from its centre ♦ Tre£’,tise on the Brain, &c. p. 92.

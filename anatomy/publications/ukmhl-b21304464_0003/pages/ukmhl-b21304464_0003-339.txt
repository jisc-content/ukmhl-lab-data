‘ NERVES OF THE NECK, &C. 311 The three inferior cervical and first dorsal nerves pass between the scalenus anticus and me- dius muscle, and under the subclavian muscle, to the axilla, where they form the axillary plexus of nerves. In the axillary plexus of nerves, there is a very intimate intermixture of nervous threads*, which surrounds the axillary artery and vein. The following nerves are derived from the ax- illary plexus, , 1st, A Number of Small Nerves to the sub- scapulary, teres,major, and latissimus dorsi mus- cles. 2d, The External Thoracic Nerves, which accompany the external thoracic arteries to the pectoral muscles, mammae, and skin over these.

Tab. xv. & xvi. • “ Every nerve,” says my Father, of the spinal marrow is joined near to its exit by an arch, with the nerve above and be- low it; but the connection oP tlie several nerves of the arm, or of the leg, may be considered as chief examples of plexus.” “ M^y years ago, I was at the pains of tracing the fibres of the nerves of the arm, from their origin in the spinal mar- row to their termination in the parts of the arm, by slitting open the sheaths of all the trunks where they form the brachial plexus. I found, indeed, as I expected, that in tlie plexuses the "fibres of the different trunks were intermixed, and that every nerve under the plexus consisted of fibres of all .the nerv'es, which were tied together above its origin from the plexus,”

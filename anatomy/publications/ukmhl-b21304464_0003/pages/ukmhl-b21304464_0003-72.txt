OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. There is a small tube which arises from the lower part of the epididymis after it has been re- flected, through which the semen passes, which has been called the vas dejerens. The testes are contained in a sort of bag, called scrotum^ covered by scattered hairs ; the skin of which is browner ; more largely supplied with sebaceous glands ; and possesses a larger share of contractile power than in any other part of the The scrotum is lined by cellular substance, which has somewhat of a pale red colour, from the number of blood-vessels distributed upon it, and which has been by some anatomists described as a muscle, under the name dartos; but even in the most robust subjects, the muscular fibres arc not visible. . There is very little fat contained within the ■ scrotum, excepting near to the under abdominal aperture ; because the pressure or unnatural accu- mulation of fat might have injured the structure or function of the testes. The scrotum is divided into two sacs by a par- tition, which is composed of cellular substance; opposite to which there is a ridge in the spine of the scrotum. The spermatic cord is also covered by a sheath of peritoneum and fine cellular membrane, which in hernias sometimes attains a considerable thickness • This covering of the cord has been fully described by Dr Peter Camm;r in the Explanation of his Plates m Hen^ia,

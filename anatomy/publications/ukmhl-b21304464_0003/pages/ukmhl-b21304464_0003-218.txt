OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 190 minute fibrils issue between the outer edges the two plates. There are likewise minute holes in the sides of each of the plates which compose the lamina spiralis ; and there can be no doubt that the nerves between the plates are con* nected with those which run on their external surface. “ The last branches or fibres of the portio mollis pass through the cribriform plate, in the top of the modiolus, which is common to it and the in- fundibulum, to supply the last half-gyrus and cupola of the cochlea. “ I next observed, that the several branches of the portio mollis, in their whole course along the lamina spiralis, formed an elegant and intricate plexus, by innumerable joinings and separations of their component fibrils. “ At the root or osseous part of the lamina spiralis, the nerves are white and opaque ; but at the flexible and membranous parts, they are semipellucid. “ This change of colour is like to that we ob- serve the optic nerve undergoes on entering the eye-ball to form the retina ; and, in both, the change of colour is not very gradually made, but suddenly. “ On comparing the semipellucid outer part of the lamina spiralis with the retina of the eye> I observed a remarkable difference ; to-wit, that in tbe retina the texture seems pulpy and uniform,

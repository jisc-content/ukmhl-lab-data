DISEASES OF the COATS of the TESttCLE. 81 cd by a substance like the brain in a state of pu- trefaction^ This disease has been called the fun- gus hamatodes *. There is a disease of the testicle, which has not, as far as I know, been described by any author, in which the body of the testicle is converted in- to a substance of the colour and consistence of yel- low Wax. The testis has been described by Dr Baillie, as being sometimes cartilaginous, and sometimes even bony and occasionally it has been converted into a mass of hydatids. A wasting of the testicle is perhaps the most common organic derangement of this gland; and this disease in some instances attacks both testes. Water, pus, and calculous matter, have been said to be sometimes found in the vesiculae semi- nales. Sect. II. OF THE ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE COATS OF THE TESTICLE. The coats of the testes, being serous membranes, partake of all the organic derangements peculiar to membranes of that description. * Vid. Wardrop on Fungus Haematodefi. , VOL. III. F

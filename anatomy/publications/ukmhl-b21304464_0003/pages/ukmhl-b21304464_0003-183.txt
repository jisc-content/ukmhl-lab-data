OF THE CRYSTALLINE LENS. 155 ■+ Treatise on the Brain, &c. p. 87,-89. even to those of glass, which, of the same size and shape, would collect the light at the distance of a quarter of an inch * ; yet, as the specific weight of the human lens does not exceed that of water above a tenth part, its powers are much greater than have been supposed by authors ; and the fo- cus formed by the human lens, will be found to be situated, nearly, half-way between those pro- duced by glass and water f.” The lens is composed of a number of concentric layers, united to each other by cellular sub- stance. These layers may be disunited, by putting the lens into boiling water, or into an acid. When the lens has been steeped for some time in water, its component layers assume a radiated appearance. There is no reason to suppose, the fibres which compose the lens to be muscular, or to possess the property of changing the form of the lens ; and if the lens had been muscular, the contraction of the centre of the lens, must have occasioned the la- ceration of the external part of the lens. The crystalline lens is contained in a pellucid and elastic capsule, which is thinner behind than * " In this calculation, I suppose that the radius of the sphere of wliich the anterior part of the lens is a portion, is 7^ lines ill length, and that of its posterior part 5 lines only.”

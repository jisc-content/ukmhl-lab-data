OF THE FIBULAR ARTERY. 36S tibialis posticus and flexor longus .pollicis ; and, near to the bottom of the leg, divides into the anterior and posterior peroneal branches. The peronea anterior passes through the interosseous li- gament, and communicates with the external mal- leolar arteries. The peronea posterior descends behind the external malleolus to the outer and back part of the foot, and anastomoses with the external malleolar and external plantar arteries. The posterior tibial artery, placed between the tibialis posticus and flexor communis digitorum, follows the course of the tibia to the lower end of that bone ; and becoming more superficial, is si- tuated between the inner ancle and the tendo a- chillis. There are several small branches detached from the posterior tibial artery to the adjacent muscles, and several small branches to the os calcis, Avhich communicate with the smaller branches of the an- terior tibial artery. The trunk of the artery then passes to the sole of the foot, and before passing behind the ab- duetor pollicis, divides into the Internal and External Plantar Arteries. The Internal Plantar Artery, is placed on the inner-side of the sole of the foot, between the abductor pollicis, and tendinous aponeurosis of the sole. From this artery, several small branches are de- tached, which are proper to the muscles and in- teguments of the sole of the foot.

495 CONCLUSION. tt never escaped my thoughts 'for a moment, that the healthy anatomy is cultivated chiefly to assist the medical practitioner in ministering to the ailments and distresses of mankind, and that this application constitutes the professional value of the science, and its subserviency to the duties of a use- ful art.â€™ The Summer Course, lately instituted, takes nothing from that delivered in the winter, which the progress of knowledge had led me to superadd to it, but was intended solely for the pur- pose of prosecuting at greater length a particular branch of the general subject which has many strong claims to accurate and minute investigation. While these Outlines bear witness to the nature and extent of the subjects discussed in the Anatomi- cal Chair, I am not unwilling to hope, that they may be of considerable practical utility to the Students for whose benefit they have been designed, by ap- prizing them of the articles to be brought under their review; by suggesting the books which it may be proper to consult, in order to prepare thein for entering fully into the detail of facts and illus- trations ; and by serving afterwards as the notes of an artificial memory, to bring their knowledge readily to their recollection.

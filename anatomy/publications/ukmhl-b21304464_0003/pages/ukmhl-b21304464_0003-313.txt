OF THE EIGHTH PAIR OF NERSVE. 285 with the laryhgeal nerve, and with the accessory nerve and sympathetic. 2. The Superior Laryngeal Branch, which divides into an external and internal branch ; the former of which, joins with the intercostal nerve. The interior branch creeps along the margin of the thyroid cartilage, and its branches are distri- buted upon the epiglottis, the membrane of the pharynx, the arytenoid muscles and arytenoid gland. The exterior branch anastomoses with a ganglion of the sympathetic; and from this junc- tion of nerves, small branches are sent, which sup- ply the constrictor muscles. The eighth pair also sends branches which unite with the Sympathetic Nerve in the upper part of the chest, from which small nerves are sent to the heart. There is a large branch of the eighth pair, which takes a retrograde course ; on the right side it passes behind the subclavian artery, and on the left be- hind the trunk of the aorta ; called the recurrent. The recurrent branch of the eighth pair is join-r ed with several branches from the ganglia of the sympathetic nerve. The recurrent branches of the eighth pair ascend, and send branches to the trachea, to the oesopha- gus, and to the thyroid gland. 1 he continuation of the recurrent nerve unites with the superior laryngeal nerve ; and after the union of these nerves, there are many branches sent

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 186' “ The central pillar of the cochlea consists of two parts, called modiolus and infundibulum. The modiolus is not a solid osseous cone, as has been generally supposed, but may be con- sidered as a hollow cone, containing that branch of the portio mollis which is destined for the cochlea ; and is everywhere cribriform, for the passage of the branches of that nerve. The in- fundibulum is an imperfect osseous funnel, con- nected to the top of the modiolus. So that the modiolus and infundibulum are two hollow coni- cal bodies, connected together by their small ends. The plate which is between them, and in the cen- tre of both, is cribriform. Around the modiolus, the first gyrus of the cochlea, and half of the se- cond gyrus are described; the other half gyrus incloses the foot of the infundibulum ; and the upper ends of the gyri, which communicate with each other, are covered or inclosed by the cupola of the cochlea. “ The partitions of bone which separate the gyri from each other, are not composed of one solid plate, as authors have represented *, but consist of two plates, connected to the modiolus at some distance from each other. “ The osseous root of the lamina spiralis is like- wise composed of two plates, connected to the * l>u Verney.—Cassebohm, T. 5.

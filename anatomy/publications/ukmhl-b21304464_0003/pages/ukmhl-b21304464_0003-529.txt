501 EXPLANATION OF PLATES. liS gether, and very easily detached or broken from each other. The internal layers only differ from the external surface, in being of a lighter colour, and of a less crystalline texture. It is composed of phosphat of lime and water, without any ap- preciable quantity of animal matter. It possesses the following chemical properties : “ It neither decrepitates nor burns before the ' blow-pipe, but fuses when strongly heated. It readily dissolves, without effervescence, and ‘ without affording any sensible residue, in the mu- riatic and the nitric acids. The whole taken up by these acids, is thrown dow"n by ammonia, and the precipitated matter is quite insoluble in oxalic acid. The calculus, heated to redness in a glass tube, yields as much as 20 per cent, of water, and nothing else besides the fixed phosphat of lime. This, I believe, is- a new fact. I am not aware, that water ever before has been found combined with phosphat of lime. It is a true hydrophos- phat, and I have formed artificially a similar one, though with a smaller proportion of water. “ Fig. 6.—represents a calculus consisting chief- ly of uric acid, with a small quantity of extractive matter, and of earthy salts. It is brittle, and its fracture is resinous.” Fig. 7.—represents a large concretion, which, had been imbedded within the pelvis of the. kidney.

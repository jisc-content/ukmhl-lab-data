46’0 ' ■ OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. ‘ 4th, The aorta sometimes takes its rise from both ventricles of the heart. The 5th kind of malconformation is extremely rare ; in this, the pulmonary artery is impervious at its origin, and but a small quantity of blood flows into it by a retrograde action of the canalis arteriosus; which, to make use of the language of Dr Wm. Hunter, who has described this mal- conformation, instead of going backward as a con- tinuation of the trunk of the pulmonary artery, it began from the left branch of that artery, ris- ing upwards and forw^ards to its termination in the curvature of the aorta, nearly under or opposite to the left subclavian ; it had carried the blood., from the aorta to the pulmonary artery, and there- fore took the appearance of a branch of the aorta, rather than that of the pulmonary artery. Upon opening the right ventricle, it appeared to be almost solid flesh, and hardly any of the cavity remained open. It was therefore very plain, that there had been no circulation of blood through the right ventricle. The returning blood of both cavae, had passed through the foramen' ovale and left ventricle into the aorta, from which, by the canalis arteriosus, a small portion had been conveyed by a retrograde motion into the left branch of the pulmonary artery, and thence, no doubt, through the whole, to receive the benefit of respiration. This species of malconformation, is still more unfrequent than the preceding, and has only been

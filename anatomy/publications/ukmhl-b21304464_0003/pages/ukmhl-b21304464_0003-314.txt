The Ninth Pair of Nerves has been already described, with the exception of the branch of this nerve, called the descendens noni, which is de- rived from the branch of that nerve situated between the internal jugular vein, and internal carotid artery, and which then crosses over the carotid arteries. This branch passes down along the common carotid artery, gives branches to the omo-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, and afterwards joins the second and third cervical ganglion. Of the Sympathetic Nerve. The Sympathetic Nerve forms a plexus with the fifth and sixth pairs of nerves, upon the surface of the internal carotid artery, while it is placed in the carotic canal. The sympathetic is distinguished from the other nerves of the neck by its ganglia *.

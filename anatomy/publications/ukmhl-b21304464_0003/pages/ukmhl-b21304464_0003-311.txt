PORTIO DURA OF THE SEVENTH PAIR. 283 supplies the inferior maxillary gland, the sublin- gual gland, and muscles of the tongue. The main trunk of the nerve passes between the pterygoid muscles, and afterwards reaches the hole between the coronoid and condyloid proces- ses of the under-jaw â€¢, and from this nerve, while in the inferior maxillary canal, a number of small nerves are derived, which enter the teeth of the under-jaw. The continuation of this nerve passes outwards through the anterior mental hole, and is distributed upon the muscles of the fore-part of the chin. Of ihe Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair. The Portio Dura of the seventh Pair of Nerves, takes its origin from the pons Varolii and medulla oblongata. It is disunited from the portio mollis at the bottom of the meatus auditorius internus, and enters the aqueduct of Fallopius, where it receives a retrograde branch of the fifth pair, which has passed through the foramen innominatum, on the anterior plane of the pars petrosa. Before leaving this aqueduct, it gives off the chorda tympani, which passes between the long process of the mal- leus and incus, and along the membrane of the drum, and afterwards in a fissure at the outside of the eustachian tube. This nerve also forms ajunc-. tion with the lingual branch of the fifth pair ; and from it, branches are derived, which supply the muscles of the malleus.

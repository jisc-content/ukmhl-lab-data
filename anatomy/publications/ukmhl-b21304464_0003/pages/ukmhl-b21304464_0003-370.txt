OUrj^INES OF ANATOMY, A few small branches of the renal arteries supply the fat around the kidneys with blood, and also the renal capsules. The fat around the kidneys is also supplied with blood from the diapliragmatic arteries. Of the Spermatic Arteries, The Spermatic are the next arteries which take their rise from the fore-side of the aorta; they run towards the pelvis along the psoas mus- cles behind the peritoneum ; the right passes over the vena cava, and the left behind the cholic arte- ries. The spermatic arteries join the spermatic veins on the psoas muscle. The spermatic arteries of the male then pass along the inguinal canal, through the upper and under abdominal apertures, and are at length dispersed upon the epididymis and body of the testicles. The spermatic arteries also send branches in their course downwards lo the ureters. The spermatic arteries of the female divide in- - to two branches : the posterior pass along the broad ligaments of the uterus to the ovaria ; the anterior pass along the fallopian tubes to the uterus, and communicate freely and repeatedly with the ute- rine hypogastric arteries.

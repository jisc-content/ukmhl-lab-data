OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 162 The oblique muscles of the eye form a girth around the eye-ball, between the lens and thebottom of the eye; hence, by their pressure, they increase the distance of the lens from the retina, or increase the posterior part of the axis of the eye-ball. Sect. VIIL OF THE NERVES OF THE CONTENTS OF THE ORBIT. THE second or optic nerves have been above de- scribed. The third pair is said to arise from the under and back part of the crura cerebri; they run along the upper part of the cavernous sinuses; pass through the foramina lacera, and give branches to all the muscles of the eyes, excepting the superior' oblique and abductor muscles, and send a branch to the ophthalmic ganglion. The fourth pair arises from the medullary plate which lies over the passage to the fourth ventricle ; turn round the crura cerebri, and is spent on the superior oblique muscle of the eye. The fifth pair of nerves, tg!^ its rise by two distinct parts, from the side,|Â£the tuber annulare. Before dividing into its three graat branches, the orbitar, superior, and inferior maxillary, there is a ganglion, called the Gasserian, laid across it. The orbitar branch of the fifth pair passes imme- diately under the orbitar plate of the frontal bone, and then divides into a larger and smaller branch.

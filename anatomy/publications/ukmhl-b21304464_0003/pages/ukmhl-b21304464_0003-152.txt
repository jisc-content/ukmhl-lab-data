124 OUTLINES or ANATOMY. The Arachnoid Coat. The term Arachnoid has been applied to this coat on account of its extreme thinness, and re- semblance to a spider’s web. At the base of the brain, this coat may be easily detached from the other membranes. On account of the extreme thinness of this membrane, it is difficult to detect its structure. I am inclined to suppose it a serous membrane ; for it is subject to the same orga- nic derangements as membranes of that descrip- tion. There are no vessels proper to this coat, which are of such a size as to admit the red blood. This membrane does not enter between the con- • volutions of the brain or cerebellum. Of the Pia Mater. The third membrane of the brain, called Pia Mater, is thin and very vascular ; and from it, many bloodvessels pass into the substance of the brain. This membrane enters between the convolu- tions of the brain ; and those processes or elonga- tions have been called the Tumenta Cerebri. The pia mater also gives a lining to the ventricles of the brain.

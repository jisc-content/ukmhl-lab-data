51 OF THE SPERMATIC CORD. Sect4 III. OF THE SPERMATIC CORD. The spermatic cord is composed of the sperma- tic artery, which arises from the fore-part of the aorta, of the accompanying veins, nerves, lympha- tic vessels, and the vas deferens^ united by cellular membrane. The spermatic artery, which supplies the testis with blood, arises from the fore-part of the aorta a little below the renal artery. It descends, cros- ses the ureter, becoming gradually larger ; lies over the iliacus internlis muscle, and soon reaches the upper abdominal aperture, where it covers the root of the epigastric artery ; it then passes ob- liquely downwards and inwards along the inferior edge of the internal oblique and transverse mus- cles of the'parietes of the abdomen, and passes out at the under abdominal aperture, where it is mlich larger, in consequence of the addition of the creiriaster muscle; it then follows a straight course downwards to the testis. The spermatic artery is of small calibre ; in its course to the testis is much convoluted, and its branches are distributed upon the epididymis, and body of the testicle. My Father examined with great attention the 'liltimate branches of the spermatic artery, both D 2

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 562 muscle, by which it is covered ; it anastomoses ' with the branches of the superficial femoral, and also with the branches of the superior internal ar- ticular artery. The second branch, called Superior Internal Articular Artery, descends to the inner con- dyle of the thigh-bone, and anastomoses with the external articular artery.) This artery afterwards divides into ^wo brancheSy one of which passes over the capsular ligament of the knee-joint, and assists in forming a net-w'ork of bloodvessels which covers the patella, and a still smaller branch passes on the edge of the in- ternal semilunar cartilage, and enters the cavity of the knee-joint. The deeper-seated branch passes along the cap- sular ligament, and divides into a number of small arteries, which enter the internal condyle of the thigh. The Inferior Internal Articular Artery ascends, and is covered by the tendinous aponeu- rosis of the semimembranosus, sartorius and semi- tendinosus muscles ; and by the internal lateral ligament of the knee ; and it anastomoses with the preceding artery. There are also two external articular arteries^ a Superior and an Inferior, derived from the popli- teal artery : the former supplies the muscles in the vicinity of the outer condyle of the thigh-bone and the external lateral ligament; the latter,

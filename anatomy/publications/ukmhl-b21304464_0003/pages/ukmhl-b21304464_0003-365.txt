br THE VENA PORTARUM; 337 Of the Inferior Mesenteric Artery. o The Inferior Mesenteric Artery, derived from the left side of the aorta, descends behind the peritoneum upon the psoas muscle, and soon di- vides into an ascending branch ; and the left colic artery ; the former of which supplies the colon with blood ; and communicating with the Colica media, forms the mesocolic arch ; the latter sup- plies the sigmoid flexure of the colon, called MORRHoiDALis Interna. The continuation of the trunk of the artery descends behind the back part of the intestinum curvuro, which it supplies vvith blood, and communicates with the left colic ar- tery. Sect.

The veins correspond In their situation with the arteries above described, except the hepatic. •The large trunks of the veins, viz. the Mesen- teric, the Gastric, and the Splenic, unite in forming a large venous trunk, which lies under the head of the pancreas, and then enters the liver at its’Portae •, and hence has been called the Vena Portarum. The vena Portae reaches the liver, VOL. HI. y

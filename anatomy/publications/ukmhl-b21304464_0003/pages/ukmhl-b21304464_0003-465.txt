4S7 MAMM^ OF THE FOETUS, &C. Ee 3 The lungs of the fetus in utero, are small, dense, and firm, and bear a strong resemblance to the liver in colour and consistence, and sink in water. Their specific weight is to that of water, as 22 to 2J. Of the Mammcs of the Foetus. The mammae are large in proportion to the size of the body of the fetus, and contain a fluid, which may be pressed out from them. Of the Abdomen and its Contents. The abdomen of the fetus is conical towards the navel, proportionally larger, and also more prominent than that of the adult. The diaphragm of the fetus is much less con- cave towards the abdomen ; and hence the liver descends in the fetus, lower than the edge of the thorax. The stomach is more rounded, and its length is proportionally greater than in the adult. The larger omentum connected with the great- er curvature of the stomach, is placed more on the left side, and there is a much smaller quantity of fat connected with it. '

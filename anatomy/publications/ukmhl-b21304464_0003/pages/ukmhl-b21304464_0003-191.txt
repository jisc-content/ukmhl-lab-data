163 OF THE EYE-LIDS. Tho’larger b'ra'nch sends a nerve along the ab- ductor oculi to the lacrymal gland, and to the mem- branes and fat near it.’ -Another branch of this nerve joins with a btanch of the fifth pair, and forms the Ophthalmic Ganglion, which is placed on the outer side of the optic nerve before the foramen lacerum. The Ciliary Nerves are derived from the ophthalmic ganglion. The orbitar branch of the fifth pair also detaches the nasal branch, which passes under the levator oculi, to the inner side of the orbit. The continuation of the trunk of this nerve passes through the foramen supra or- bitarium, and is distributed on the forehead. The sixth pair of nerves' begins from the tuber annulare; they pass vVithin the cavernous sinus; then through the foramina lacera, and terminate in the abductor muscle of the eye. Sect. IX.

' The Par Vagum of the right side, situated upon the back-part of the stomach, divides into two plexuses ; one of which joins the hepatic plexus -, the' other is distributed upon* the up^ per and great left sac of the stomach'. The Semilunar Solar Ganglion*, formed by the paria vtiga and the rami splanchnici, is of an irr&gular form and from it, nerves are de- rived, which accompany the coeliac artery and it® branches. The Coeliac Ganglion Covers the aorta, and the roots of the coeliac and superior mesentevfe ar-i teries; from which a nervous plexus is derived, which covers the trunks and branches of the cce- liac and the superior mesenteric arteries. From this ganglion, the hepatic plexuses are al- so derived. From the right hepatic plexus, the right extre- mity of the pancreas is supplied; the pyloric por- tion of the stomach ; the duodenum, and the great- er curvature of the stomach. The branches of the hepatic plexus also accom- pany the branches of the hepatic »artery and vena portarum through the substance of the liver ; and are also distributed upon the gall-bladder and bi- liary ducts.

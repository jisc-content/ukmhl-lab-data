It consists of very small brilliant crystals, but slightly com- pacted together, and is in consequence very fran- gible. Uric acid, and extractive matter, are its chief constituent parts; It contains, besides, a very small quantity of phosphat of lime, about 1 per cent. “ The characteristic chemical properties of this kind of calculus are the following. It is very lit- tle acted on by muriatic acid. Nitric acid dis- solves it readily, and the solution evaporated af- fords a fine pink*coloured residue. It is partially dissolved by a caustic solution of potash or soda, and partially by water. The alkali takes up the uric acid, and the water the extractive matter. Before the blow-pipe, it inflames; emits a strong ammoniacal odour, and almost entirely consumes; leaving only a very little fixed ash, which is gene- rally phosphat of lime or magnesia, or oxalat of lime, or mixtures of these sglts. Heated in a close vessel, it affords, besides different gases, water, sub-carbonat of ammonia, and a yellow bitter oil, of a butyraceous consistence. This is the mo?t common species of urinary calculus. liS

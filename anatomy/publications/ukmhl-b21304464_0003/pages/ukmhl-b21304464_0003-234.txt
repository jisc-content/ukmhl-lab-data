OUTLINES or ANATOMY. 205 The hairs grow from bulbs of various forms,' which are imbedded within the cellular substance under the skin.' Each bulb has been said to have two capsules or membranes, with an oily fluid interposed be- tween them, from which the hairs derive their co- lour. Different opinions have been entertained respec- ting the structure of the human hairs. Accord- ing to some authors, each hair is made up of a se- ries of smaller hairs ; and according to others, each hair is a tube through which the oily fluid which gives the hair a peculiar colour, flows. It must be acknowledged, that we are still ig- norant respecting the structure of the human hairs, which are so slender as to render it extremely dif- ficult to examine their structure. In quadrupeds, the hairs are much larger ; and the bristles of the boar, when examined by the aid of the microscope, have been observed to be com- posed of a number of filaments; and in the middle of the bristle, there are two canals, which contain a liquor, called the medulla. / Chemical Analysis of Hair. From the experiments of Vauqjjelin, it ap- pears, that black hair is composed of the following ingredients ; An animal matter, constituting the greatest part.

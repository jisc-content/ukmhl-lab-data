OUTLINES OF ANATOMY, 4 The nerves of the kidneys are derived from the sympathetic nerves. >Renal Glands. The renal glands are of a yellow colour; some- what of a triangular form ; about two inches long ; and surrounded by cellular substance ; and adhere to the upper and fore parts of the kidneys. These glands are sometimes filled by a bilious- looking fluid. , Of iht Ureter^ The tube by which the urine flows from the kidney to the bladder of urine, is called ureter. The ureter arises fcj)m the inner and lower part of the pelvis or kidney, by its infundibulum. This tube is not cylindrical, but contracted where it passes over the brim of the pelvis, and between the coats of the bladdef. Generally there is only one to each kidney, but I have seen two on one side. The spermatic vessels cross over the ureters, opposite to the sacro-iliac symphysis; then the ureter crosses the common iliac artery and vein. At the base of the os sacrum, the ureters pass down- wards, forwards, and inwards, and towards the under surface of the bladder, where they cross the vasa deferentia, and then enter the bladder oh- liquely, between the muscular and mucous coats, and open by a narrow orifice at the posterior angle of the triangular space near the neck of the bladder.

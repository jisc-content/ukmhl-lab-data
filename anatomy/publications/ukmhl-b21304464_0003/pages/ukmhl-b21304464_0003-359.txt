LYMPHATIC VESSELS OF THE HEART. 331 1 Of the Lymphatic Vessels of the Heart, The lymphatic vessels of the heart accompany the coronary arteries; those of the right side pass over the arch of the aorta, to a lymphatic gland situated behind the origin of the carotid arteries, and terminate on the right side. The lymphatic vessels which accompany the left coronary artery, pass into a gland situated be- hind the pulmonary artery, between the arch of the aorta, and root of the trachea. These termi- nate on the upper end of the thoracic duct *. * The lymphatic vessels of the heart, are much smaller thaa those of the lungs; they have been very beautifully represent- ed by Mascagni in his 26th Plate.

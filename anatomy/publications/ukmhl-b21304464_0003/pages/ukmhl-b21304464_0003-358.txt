580 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. The thoracic duct is of unequal diameter : the receptacle of the chyle, the origin of the duct, is about one-third of an inch in diameter ; it is much contracted about the middle of the chest, and then becomes gradually larger as it, ascends. There are many lymphatic vessels joined to the thoracic duct during its ascent along the spine, from the bowels of the abdomen, the intercostal spaces, and from the lungs. Of the Lymphatic Vessels of the Lungs. There are two sets of lymphatic vessels pro- per to the lungs, a superficial and deeper-seated set. The former describe areolae between the lo- bules of the lungs, and pass into the bronchial glands; where these are joined by the deeper- seated lymphatic vessels, which accompany the branches of the trachea and pulmonary artery. There are some of the absorbent vessels of the left lungs which pass through glands behind the arch of the aorta. The lymphatic vessels which have passed through the bronchial glands, form trunks which ascend on the fore-part of the vena cava superior, and terminate in Steno’s duct on the right side of the neck. >

The branches of this artery, 'txz, firsty The In- ternal Mammary, which passes behind the arti- culation of the clavicle with the breast-bone ; and opposite to the inferior laryngeal artery, descends between the pleura and cartilages of the true ribs, and betweeu'the sterno-costalis and intercos- tal muscles. The branches of the internal mammary artery, are, 1. Small branches to the thymus gland. . 2. A branch which follows the same course as the phrenic nerve, and which terminates upon the diaphragm. 3. Small branches to the mediastinum and peri- cardium. 4. Branches to the intercostal muscles, and the integuments of the breast.

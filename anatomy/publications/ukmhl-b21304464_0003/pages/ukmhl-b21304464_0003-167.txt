OF THE NOSE. 139 vomer, constitute the under, inner and back part of the nose. The internal nares are two cavities placed be- tween the external nares and the posterior open- ings of the nose into the throat. The turbinated processes of ethmoid bone, and the ossa turbinata iriferiora, project into the cavi- ties of the nose, and add much to the extent of the internal surface of the nostrils. In quadrupeds that smell very acutely, the in- ternal surface of the nose is very much extended by the complex structure of the turbinated bones. Three passages into the nose have been descri- bed by Haller ; an upper passage above the tur- binated processes of the ethmoid bone ; a passageâ€™ between the turbinated processes of the ethmoid bone and inferior spongy bones; and a passage below the inferior turbinated bones ; and this pas- sage being straight, a probe may readily be pas- sed along it into the throat. The septum narium is composed of the descend-, ing plate of the ethmoid bone, of the vomer, and cartilage. , The soft parts of the nose are ; its cartilages, ligaments, membranes, muscles, and skin. There are five cartilages of the nose; the largest of which, the basis on which the lateral cartilages rest, is placed in the middle. The middle cartilage, also, forms a considerable share of the septum narium ; and is fixed to the vomer j to the spinous process of the ossa maxil-

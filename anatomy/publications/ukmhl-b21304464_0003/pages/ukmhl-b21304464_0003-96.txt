OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 68 Sect. IV. OF THE UTERINE OR FALLOPIAN TUBES. The uterine tubes are connected with the late- ral parts of the fundus uteri; are about three inches long, curved in form, like a trumpet, with the narrow end next the uterus ; and at the opposite end there are a number of fimbriated pro- cesses. These tubes are covered by the peritoneum, within which in some subjects I have observed dis- tinct muscular fibres, and they are lined by an in- ternal and soft pulpy membrane. 7'hese tubes have been observed, in animals kil- led soon after coition, firmly embracing the ova- ria by their fimbriated extremities. Sect. V. OF THE VAGINA. The vagina, the channel of communication be- tween the uterus and external organs, is very dis- tensible, curved, continued downwards and for- wards, nearly in the course of the axis of the pelvis, and in virgins considerably'wider above than below, and rather longer behind than before.

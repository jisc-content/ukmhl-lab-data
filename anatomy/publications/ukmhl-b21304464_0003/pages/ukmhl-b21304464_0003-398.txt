370 OUTLINES or ANATOMY. The lymphatic vessels form a plexus over the toes, from which many lymphatic vessels pass over the top of the foot to the inner part of the leg. There is another set of lymphatic vessels on the outer side of the foot, which cross over the front of the tibia, so as to reach the popliteal glands, which are situated around the popliteal artery. There are a number of lymphatic vessels on the inner side of the thigh, which follow the same course as the vena saphaena major, and lead to the ingui- nal lymphatic glands. The inguinal lymphatic glands vary in number and size; frequently there are only five or six dis- tinct glands ; on other occasions, a greater num- ber, and they are disposed in an upper and an un- der cluster ; and some of them lie upon the tendi- nous.aponeurosis of the thigh, but oftener beneath it. The lymphatic vessels of the thigh enter the lower cluster ; but there are some of them which are not connected with any of the lymphatic glands. The deeper-seated lymphatic vessels, which are less numerous than the superficial set, accompany the arteries, and are placed on each side of the arteries. They arise from the sides of the toes; accom- pany the plantar arteries ; and running up the leg, accompany the posterior tibial artery. There*

189 OF THE PORTIO MOLLIS. would suppose, that the two sides of each scala should have nerves distributed on them in the same manner. â€œ Accordingly, on prosecuting the branches or fibres of the portio mollis with the utmost atten- tion, I find, that they pass outwards from the ca- vity of the modiolus, through innumerable mi- nute holes or canals, which every where perforate it. Some fibrils pass between the two plates which form the septa that separate the gyri from each other. A still greater number of fibrils passes through holes between the two plates which com- pose the root of the lamina spiralis. But by far the greatest number of the nervous fibrils perfo- rates the sides of the modiolus, between the os- seous septa and the lamina spiralis. The fibrils which pass through the holes that are nearest to the lamina spiralis, run to the membrane covering the lamina spiralis; wdiilst those which are near- est to the septa, run in a contrary direction, to the membranes covering the septa. We perceive, therefore, that the part of the membrane lining each scala, which is the most distant from the modiolus, will be supplied by the terminations of of these two sets of fibrils meeting. The nervous fibrils on the surface of the lamina spiralis, seem larger, and are more regularly disposed, than those that run on the surface of the septa. Two plates are found in the outer osseous part of the lamina spiralis, and the space between them is fil- led with nervous fibres,, from which numeroiis

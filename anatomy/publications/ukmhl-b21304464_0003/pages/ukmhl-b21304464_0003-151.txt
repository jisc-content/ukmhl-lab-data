123 . OF THE BURA MATER. The dura mater is supplied with blowd from the external carotid artery ; as also from the internal carotid and vertebral arteries. Iht superior longitudinal sinus, imbedded be- tween the layers of the dura mater, takes its rise at the crista j^alli of the ethmoid bone, runs along the upper part of the falciform process of the dura mater, becoming gradually larger, and divides, opposite to the most prominent part of the os occipitis, into two lateral branches or si- nuses. The smaller veins of the brain open into the superior longitudinal sinus at its upper and back part, and their orifices are chiefly directed ob- liquely forwards. The right and left branches of the superior lon- gitudinal sinus, called the lateral sinuses, which are imbedded in the grooves of the occipital and temporal bones, follow a tortuous course, and at length terminate in the internal jugular vein. The fourth sinus or Torcular Herophili, is a short canal, situated at the junction of the falx and ten- torium, which it passes, downwards and backwards, and joins the lateral sinuses. The inferior longitudinal sinus, lodged in the under part of the falx, is very small when com- pared with the upper, and is sometimes awant- ing.

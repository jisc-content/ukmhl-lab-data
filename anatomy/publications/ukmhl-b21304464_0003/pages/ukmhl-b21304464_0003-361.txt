ABDOMINAL AORTA. 533 â€™ The Abdominal Aorta is situated on the left side of the bodies of the vertebrae ; and approaches gradually to the middle of the vertebrae. The First Branches of the Abdominal Aorta are distributed upon the diaphragm. These are two in number ; they cross over the crura of the dia- phragm ; are distributed on every *part of this muscle; and a few of the smaller branches sup- ply the renal capsule, fat of the kidney, and car- dia. The next branch is large, and short, called cor- //flc, which subdivides immediately into three branches \ the Superior gastric. Hepatic,, and Splenic arteries. The trunk of the coeliac is surrounded by the lesser curvature of the sto- mach. The Superior Gastric is the smallest of the branches; it ascends, is distributed chiefly on the right side of the cardia ; and its branches anasto- mose with the arteries of the gullet; it pas- ses upon the smaller curvature of the stomach ; and its branches are distributed in all directions, and anastomose freely with the ramifications of the hepatic and splenic arteries. The pext branch of the coeliac, is the Splenic, which runs transversely across the body behind, and then on the upper-part of the pancreas, to which it gives several branches, and divides into five or six branches in the notch of the spleen, which carry blood to every part of that organ.

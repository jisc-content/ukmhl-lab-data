BRANCHES OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 9.99 The ulnar artery also sends a branch, named ulnaris profunda, which anastomoses with the deeper-seated arterial arch, formed by the radial artery. From the superficial arch, an artery is. also sent to the thumb. At the roots of the fingers, there is generally a communication between the superficial and deep- seated arterial arches. The Radial Artery passes over the pronator teres, and then along the fore-part of the radius between the supinator radii longus, and flexor car-r pi radialis. This artery, in its course downwards, becomes more superficial, and at the wrist lies close on the radius. It sends off a recurrent branch, which passes between the tendon of the biceps, and supinator radii longus, and anastomoses at the outer part of the elbow-joint with the profunda humeri. There are many mall branches sent from this artery in its course downwards along the radius, to supply the neighbouring muscles. From the branch of the radial, called super- ficialis vola, another proceeds along the outer side of the thumb, which passes over the abductor pollicis, and anastomoses with the ulnar arch. The size of this branch is various in different in- dividuals. There are also s?nall branches of the radial ar- tery distributed upon the ligaments and bones of

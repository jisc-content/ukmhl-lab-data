OUTLINES OF ANATOMY, • •1.8G succeeded by hectic fever. The sac, containing the foetus, bursts generally about the third month of pregnancy ; a great deal of fetid matter, and coagulated blood, and sometimes bones, are dis- charged by the rectum *, vagina f, or bladder In some cases, even an entire foetus has been dis- charged from the navel §, or by the rectum j]. But in some cases the extra-uterine foetus re- mains for years within the abdomen, without gi- ving rise to any peculiar symptoms. There is a case in the Museum of the University, in which a foetus, which was in part covered by a shell of . bone, remained within the abdomen for thirty- four years. The patient had been in labour for twelve days, after which the labour-pains entirely went off. Nothing had been discharged. The patient car- ried the mass for thirty-four years. After death, it was cut out by Mr Logan, surgeon in Ayr- shire. • * Vid. PouTEAU, Melang. p. 373.;—also Winthrop, Phil. Trans. 43. '+ Vid. SMitH, Med. Comment, vol. v.; Med. and Phys.

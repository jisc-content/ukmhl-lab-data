145 COATS OF THE EYE-BALL. it; and this paint, which is thicker and darker coloured in the Negro than in the European, is of a very* peculiar nature, and is not altered by heat, by immersion in spirits, or by chemical tests. Nearly opposite to the ciliary circle, there is a dark-brown radiated circle, about one-sixth of an inch broad, called Corpus ciliare ; and near to the root of the iris, the choroid coat is folded into six- ty or seventy folds, which are lined by dark paint. The dark paint of the choroid coat serves to (pre- vent the reflection of light, and the formation of a second image. The nerves^ called Ciliary, which are flat, may be observed passing along the surface of this coat, accompanied by the long ciliary arteries, and the ramifications of the shorter ciliary arteries, also the smaller accompanying veins, which, from fol- lowing a vorticose course, have been called Ve7ue mrticosce. ' Ciliary Ligament, or Ciliai'y Circle. The ciliary ligament is composed of dense cel- lular membrane, and appears as a grey ring, which connects the choroid coat and margin of the iris to the sclerotic coat. This ligament has been stated by Soemmering to be composed chiefly of the ciliary nerves and of bloodvessels. A triangular canal ha& been described by Fon- tana, Soemmering and Murray, as .running YOL. HI. K

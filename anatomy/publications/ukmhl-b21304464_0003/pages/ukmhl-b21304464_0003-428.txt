400 OUTLINES OF ANATOMV. of our different organs, which are occasioned by stimuli. This proposition is obvious from the following circumstances: 1. Muscles, supplied by the nerves irritated, often do not act, but others at a distance. Thus, when the outside of the fore-arm is burnt, not the extensors, but the flexors of the fore-arm act, and remove it from the offending cause. 2. Muscles most connected by their nerves do not sympathise most. 3. Sympathy is not to be traced the reverse way. 4. Muscles supplied by intermediate nerves are at rest. 5. The same nerve irritated in different parts produces different motions. 6. The same nerve, gently and violently irri- tated, produces different motions. 7. The same nerve, accustomed to the stimulus^ acts less, or not at all. 8. Antagonist muscles receives nerves from the same roots. * 9. There are many sympathies, where a con- nection of nerves is not to be traced. 10. Many impulses affect the mind first. 11. Affections of the mind, without the presence of external objects, produce the same effects *. * As the late ingewieus Dr Whytt, in 1765, published a treatise on the sympathy and diseases of the nerves, in which

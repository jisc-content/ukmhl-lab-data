OUTLINES OF ANATOMT. 1870 This artery, situated on the outer side of the optic nerve, gives off a branch to the lacrymal gland; very small branches to the periosteum of the orbit; a branch which passes through the centre of the optic nerve, calledCentral Artery of the Retina, and which, on the inner side of the retina, divides into many branches, which, in the foetus, may be distinctly traced to the capsule of the crystalline lens ; as also the ciliary arteries, which, being un- equal as to length, have been divided into the longiores and bre^iores. The ciliares longer, pass through the sclerotic coat, pass along the choroid, and then subdivide into two branches, and anastomose with the corresponding arteries of the opposite side of the eye at the root of the iris. The ciliares breves, or posleriores, pass through the sclerotic coat of the eye-ball, near to the optic nerve. At the circumference of the iris, the corre- sponding ciliary arteries of the opposite sides are united, and form a circle, called the arterial circle oj the iris, from which a great number of small branches run towards the pupil, and many of them unite into arches, from which a number of small arteries are sent to the inner edge of the pupil. The muscles which move the eye-ball, and the fat in the orbit, are also supplied with blood by the smaller branches of the ocular artery. There are also small branches of the ocular ar- tery, which enter the nose, by the foramina or-

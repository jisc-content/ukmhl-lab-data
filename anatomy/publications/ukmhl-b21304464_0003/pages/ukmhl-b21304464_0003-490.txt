OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. A62 Sect. IV. OF IMPERFECTIONS AS TO THE FORMATION OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. Imperfections of the Alimentary Canal, are not unfrequent. A preternatural membrane sometimes extends across the mouth. Imperfections of a part of the intestinal canal are not uncommon, and especially those of the in- tcstinum, commonly named rectum. The first and most common malcon formation, is that in which the rectum is covered by the com- mon teguments, or by a membrane of considerable thickness. In some such cases, a swelling is perceptible, where the rectum should form the anus, which feels soft when pressed ; and on plunging a lancet into the prominent tumour, the meconium is dis- charged. This unnatural membrane is sometimes so thin, that the colour of the meconium shining through it is distinguishable *, but sometimes it is hard and thick, with a livid mark in its centre. There is a variety of this malconformation mentioned by Dr Wrisberg, in which the rec- tum terminated in a kind of cul de sac.

132 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. There are two small eminences, which have been named appendices ^ermiformes, from their re- semblance to worms â€¢, one of which is placed on the anterior and superior part of the cerebellum, the other on its inferior and posterior part. The cerebellum is joined to the cerebrum by two medullary chords, which are inserted into the substance of the cerebellum, and their fibres are intermixed with those of the medulla oblongata. There is a ventricle, foui'th, placed between the cerebellum, pons Varolii, and upper part of the medulla oblongata, and which extends from the testes to the posterior part of the cerebellum. In the under-part of the fourth ventricle, there is an angular impression, which has been supposed to bear a resemblance to a writing-pen, and is hence named calamus scriptorius. This ventricle is shut by its choroid plexus. Sect. III. TUBER ANNULARE, OR PONS VAROLII. 'I^HE tuber annulare, can only be well seen by inverting the brain. It is formed by the union of four columns, the crura cerebri and cerebelli, which form a sort of bridge ; and this in its centre is somewhat depressed. The tuber is situated upon the back-part of the body of the sphenoid and cuneiform process of the occipital bone.

54 Ol’Tl.lN)E8 OF AWATOMY. after being distended and dried, they exhibit cellular structure. Upon accurately examining .the structure of thf vesiculae, after dissecting off the cellular .substance, they are found to be composed chiefly of a long tortuous canal, shut at its upper end ; from the sides of which, similar, but shorter tubes, vary-? ing in their number in different persons, are sejit off. The vesiculae are placed obliquely, and nearly touch each other at their apices; but are at some distance at their base, which are directed back* wards. The structure of the vesiculae is nearly similar to that of the vasa deferentia; each has a strong cellular outer coat, but no muscular fi.bres are seen under the external coat. repletffi membranas sine plicarum dissolutione auferamus, ve- ram aptissime fabricam detegimus Multis etiam quadrupedi- bus structura difficilioris adhuc quam in homine indaginis est; exemplo sit erinaceus.” Vid.

372 OUTINES or ANATOMY, The sympathetic nerves, during their course to the ossa coccygis, are united with the lumbar and sacral nerves by ganglia. Of the Lumbar Nerves. The five pairs of Lumbar Nerves are connect- ed with the sympathetic nerves, and with each other. The first pair of Lumbar Nerves is connected with the twelfth dorsal, and with the second lum- bar. This pair of nerves furnishes branches to the muscles of the loins, scrotum, and to the mus- cles of the upper parts of the thighs. The second pair of Lumbar Nerves perforates the psoas muscles, to which it gives branches: and detaches also the spermatic nerves, which descend along the spermatic vessels ; and above the upper abdominal aperture, divide into two branches, one of which is distributed upon the pubes, scro- tum and testis of the male, and upon the round ligament of the female uterus and external parts of generation ; and the other branch creeps along the femoral artery, and terminates on the fore* part of the thigh. A third branch passes behind the psoas, and across the iliacus internus, and is distributed upon the muscles of the upper and in- ner part of the thigh, and terminates upon the â€¢ .vastus internus, near to the knee. /

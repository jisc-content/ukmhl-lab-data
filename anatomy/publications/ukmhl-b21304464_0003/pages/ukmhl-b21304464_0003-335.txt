VEIN^ ot THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES, ’ S07 • • Sect. III. « . ■ • t)F THE VEINS OF THE SUPERIOR EXfREMITIES. >v There ^re two sets of veins, proper to the su- perior extremities, a superficial and deeper-seated set; both of which communicate frequently with each other, and both are provided with valves. There is great variety as to the distribution of the veins in different individuals. The superficial veins of the back of the lumd go chiefly to the supcfficial, radial, and ulnar veins. The superficial radial veins on the anterior part of the fore-arm communicate with the radial ar;d ulnar veins, and with a trunk, called the media^a longa. The mediana longct. crosses over the radius, and' divides below thd elbow into the mediana cephalica and basilica ; the former terminates in the cepha- lic above the elbow, and the lattqr crosses over the humeral artery, and ends in the basilic vein, which , joins with the humeral vein. The cephalic vein runs up the arm on the outer side of the biceps musple ; and, passing between the pectoralis major and deltoid muscles, termi- nates in the axillary vein. The deeper-seated veins, named Venje comi- TEs SATELLITES, follow the saiTic coursc as the ar-

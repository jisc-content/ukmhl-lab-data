The ciliary processes are mere doublings of the choroid coat, the extremities of which hang loose in the aqueous humour. The ciliary processes are chiefly composed of a plexus of vessels ; they are not muscular, and there is no reason to suppose that they compress the lens. Sect. II. OF THE OPTIC NERVE AND RETINA. The optic nerves are commonly said to arise from the thalami nervorum opticorum* ; they are of a large size, whiter than the other nerves; are covered by the dura and pia mater ; are connect- ed to one another at the fore-part of the sella sphenoidalis. * Several anatomists, as Winslow, Zinn, Santorini, Gi- RARDi, Gall and Spurzein, are of a contrary opinion, and have affirmed, that these nerves take their rise from the Nates and Testes. In proof of which, the laSt-mentioned authors have remarked, that when the optic nerve of one side is smidler than the other, the corresponding tubercles are also smaller.

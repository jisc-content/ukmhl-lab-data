GANGLIA OF THE NERVES, S9P 2d, As the heart continues to contract ih cases of perfect apoplexy, much longer than the muscles under the immediate dominion of the will. I shall not enter more at large into the theories which have been proposed respecting the use of the ganglia * ; a subject which, like the functions of the nervous system, is still involved in an ob- scurity, which the observations' and experiments of modern anatomists have not hitherto dissipated. The last observation I shall make respecting the course of the nerves, is, that we cannot from con- nection of-nerves explain the regular movements * The reader who wishes for further information re- specting the Ganglia, is referred to the following Au- thors : Vieussen’s Neurol.

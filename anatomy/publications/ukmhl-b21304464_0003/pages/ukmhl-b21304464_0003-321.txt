BRANCHES OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. S93 T 3 rib, and, upon the back-part of the rectus muscle of the abdomen, anastomoses with the epigastric arteries. The Inferior Thyroid, or Laryngeal Artery, arises very near to the vertebral and internal mam- mary arteries. This artery gives branches to the trachea ; to the thyroid gland ; to the larynx, pharynx and oe- sophagus, and it anastomoses with the superior la- ryngeal artery. The subclavian artery bends outwards, and passes between the anterior and middle ..scaleni muscles, and then sends off the following branches. The Cervicalis Anterior, which is cover- ed by the sterno-mastoid muscle, passes upwards, . and suddenly divides into branches, which supply the muscles of the trunk of the body which are fixed into the occiput. The other and deeper branches of this artery anastomose with the -occipital and vertebral ar- teries. The Cervicalis Posterior, which takes its rise in common with the anterior cervical and infe- rior thyroid arteries; ascends on the posterior part of the neck; anastomoses with the occipital and vertebral arteries, and sends branches to the scaleni muscles, to the spinales colli, splenius, and trachelo-mastoidei muscles. The next artery which is derived from the sub- clavian, has been named the Dorsalis Scapulae

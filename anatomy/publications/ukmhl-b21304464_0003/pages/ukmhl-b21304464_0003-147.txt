U9 OF SENSATION. ficult to determine ; especially sinve the metals and water, or moist animal substances, are sup- posed to be merely conductors of electricity. Is it conceivable, that the different metals and water, or moist animal substances, contain different pro- portions of latent electrical fluid, or fluid resem- bling it; and that when the metals and animal substances are brought into contact, such a motion of the electrical or subtile fluid takes place, as produces an equilibrium in the common mass ; and that when the metals are again separated from each other, and from the animal substance, each instantly resumes that quantity of the elec- trical or subtile fluid which is proper to it; and that the rapid circulation of the electrical fluid irritates the nerve, and throws into convulsions the muscles in which it terminates ?‚Äù From the preceding observations, it appears doubtful, Whether the brain and nerves are composed of exceedingly minute tubes ; or merely of a pulpy matter inclosed within sheaths, formed by a membrane resembling the pia mater, which, besides serving with the external membrane, re- sembling the dura mater, for the defence of the pulpy matter, and for nourishing it, is capable of communicating to it the nervous energy. 2d, It appears that the energy of the nerves is not owing to an electrical matter. And, 3^, That it is probable in the highest de- gree, that the nervous energy depends on mat-

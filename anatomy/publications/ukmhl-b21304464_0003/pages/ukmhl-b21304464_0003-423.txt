distribution of the nerves. 393 Many of the lymphatic vessels are buried in the fat and cellular membrane immediately under the skin, and accompany the subcutaneous veins; others are deep-seated, and follow the same course as the arteries. A knowledge of the course of these vessels points out the source and progress of many poi- sons which are received and propagated by ab- sorption, suggests the most efficacious means of eradicating these poisons, or of arresting their progress into the blood ; and in the case of local diseases, teaches the most efficacious means of ap- plying the antidote. Sect. IV. OBSERVATIONS UPON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE . NERVES. Many of the nerves follow the same course as the branches of the arteries and veins. The nerves, in their course, are connected in three different ways ; 1st, The nerves are frequently conjoined at acute angles, or form plexuses; as in the axilla and loins. 2d, Nerves disposed in opposite directions are connected by their smaller branches, or the api- ces of these branches, forming networks j as where

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. The bloodvessels and nerves of the tongue, have a very great effect upon each other *, in proof of which, my Father observed in many of his ex- periments, that throwing a ligature around the great bloodvessel leading to this member of an animal, had the effect of diminishing the nervous energy of that part of the body ; and, on the other hand, Nuck has informed us, that when he divid- ed the nerves leading to the salivary glands, the quantity of saliva secreted by the arteries, was sensibly diminished. The papillae of the tongue are probably erected when a sapid body is applied to them ; and it seems also probable, that the flavour of some sub- stances is more distinctly perceived by one set of the papillae, than by another ; for some sub- stances make a deeper impression on the point, others on the middle, and a third set on the back- part of the tongue. There is much variety as to the perfection of this sense in different individuals, and also many peculiarities as to taste, which are in some in- stances the effect of custom, of caprice, of preg- nancy, or of disease.

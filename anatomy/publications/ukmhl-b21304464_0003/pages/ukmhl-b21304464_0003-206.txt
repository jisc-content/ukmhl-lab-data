OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 178 By means of the external cartilages of the ear, the pulses of sound are reflected into the external passage ; the intensity of which, is increased dur- ing their progress through the meatus auditorius extern us. The external meatus is not straight; it turns forwards and inwards, and ends in the membrana tympani. The cuticle with which this passage is lined, is perforated by the orifices of a number of small glands, which secrete the wax of the ear, which serves to defend the membrane of the drum from the air ; and being very bitter, may have an effect, along with the hairs in that passage, in preventing insects from entering. The external passage is closed up by the mem- brana tympani, which has lately been described as a muscle with radiated fibres. The membrana tympani, is in shape oval, about ~ of an inch long, and broad. The membrana tympani is placed obliquely in a groove of bone, and the upper part of it is turn- ed outwards, and the under inwards. The branches of the temporal and occipital ar- teries supply the external ear with blood. The nerves of the external ear are derived from the third branch of the fifth pair of nerves, and from the portio dura of the seventh pair.

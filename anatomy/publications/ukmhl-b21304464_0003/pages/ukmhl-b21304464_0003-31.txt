OF THE KIDNEYS. s The tubular 'part is of a lighter colour than the cortical, more dense, composed of small tubes united to each other. The fasciculi of urinary tubes are collected in- to conical-shaped bodies, called papillce; upon the sides and extremities of which there are visible openings through which the urine distills*. A penetrating injection sometimes imitates the secretion of urine ; that is, it passes from the re- nal artery into the uriniferous tubes, which seems to prove a continuity of the vessels. The infundibula are less numerous than the papillae, as in some instances one infundibulum is common to two papillae. The smaller infundibula are united into three large trunks, which come from the upper, middle, and lower parts of the kidney, and these form the cavity of the kidney, called pelvis. The pelvis of the kidney, which is in its middle most capacious, is placed between the large bran- ches of the renal artery and vein. The membrane of the pelvis is white, firm, but loose, and is lined by a mucous membrane. Each kidney is supplied by one or more arte- ries, called renal, which are sent off at a right angle from the aorta, and are of great, size in proportion to the bulk of the kidneys. The renal veins lead into the vena cava inferior. A2 ^ Vide the magnified figure of one of the Papillae, Plate xxx\u.

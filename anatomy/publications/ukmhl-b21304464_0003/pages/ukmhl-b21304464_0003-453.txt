PROGRESS OF GRAVID UTERUS. 425 Between the chorion and amnion, which cover the umbilical cord, there is a bag of an oval form, filled by a fluid called *vesicula alba. The quantity of the liquor amnii, is propor- tionally greater in the first than in the latter months of pregnancy. In the earlier months, the umbilical cord is very short; at the period of birth it is commonly about two feet long. The urachus constitutes a part of the umbilical cord ; it consists of thin fibres which ascend from the fundus of the bladder, and which are inserted into the navel-string. The uterus rapidly attains an unusual size, in consequence of the determination of blood to it. The difference in the size of the uterus, is con- siderable in different women ; it depends on the size and number of the foetuses, and also on the quantity of liquor amnii. The uterus does not rise so much, as to be sen- sibly felt above the ossa pubis, till after the fourth month of pregnancy. The fundus uteri is in the first place distend- ed, and then the neck of the uterus almost disap- pears. The mouth of the pregnant uterus is directed backwards, so that the axis of the uterus corre- sponds with that of the pelvis. At the fourth month, the womb measures about five inches from the fundus to the beginning of its neck.

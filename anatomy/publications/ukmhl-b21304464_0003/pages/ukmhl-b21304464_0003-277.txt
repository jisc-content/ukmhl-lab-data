On the fifth day, a small circular vesicle shews itself, which is depressed in the centre, and turgid in its circumference. During the sixth and seventh days, the vesicle increases in size, retaining its original characters; and on the eighth day the vesicle has a circular ap- pearance, and the margin is regular and well de- fined ; the centre is still more depressed, where a small crust begins to appear. If the vesicle be punctured, all its contents are not discharged at once. The vesicle is composed of many cells, and somewhat resembles a honey- comb. About the ninth day the vesicle is surrounded by a deep red coloured areola, which is to the touch hard ; and about the same time an erysi- pelatous redness sometimes takes place around the areola, and spreads so as to cover a part of the skin of the arm, equal in bulk to a circle of two or more inches in diameter.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY* 312 3d, The Sc apulary Nerves, which pass to tho muscles situated on the dorsum scapulas through the superior scapulary notch, in the upper costa of the scapula. 4th, The Articular Nerves,.which sink deep in the axilla, pass along the under edge’of the subscapularis, and accompany the posterior cir- c'umllex artery around the os humeri. From this plexus, small nerves are distributed upon the ^eres major and the deltoid muscles, and also on the capsular ligament qf the shoulder- joint. • 5th, rte Radial or Median Nerve. This nerve is placed before the trunk of the humeral artery, to which it is intimately united by cellu- lar substance. At the elbow-joint, it passes over th*e ten- don of the brachialis internus; and having per- forated the* back-part of the pronator teres, de- scends between the flexor carpi radialis and flexor sublimis, to which muscle it sends off srpall branches. From the radial nerve, a large branch called interosseous, is derived, as it passes along the inter- osseous ligament. • The interosseous nerve, in its course to the wrist, supplies the flexor muscles of the thumb and fin- gers, and terminates on the pronator radii qua- dratus. The trunk of the radial nerve passes under the annular ligament of the wrist tp the palm of the

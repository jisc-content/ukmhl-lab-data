OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 484. After delivery, inversion of the uterus some- times takes place, in different degrees; when the inversion is slight, the tumour is retained within the vagina, and the fundus uteri protrudes only to a certain degree through the mouth of the uterus ; when, on the other hand, the inversion has been complete, the vagina is also partly in- verted, and a tumour of considerable length ap- pears externally. The inversion of the uterus is sometimes fol- lowed by a profuse bleeding ; by convulsions, or syncope; or it induces distention or inflamma- tion of the bladder, by its pressure on the ure- thra ; or sometimes occasions a discharge of fe- tid matter, which is succeeded by a lingering hec- tic fever. OJ Ruptured Uterus. Any part of the womb may be ruptured. I believe the rupture of the neck of the womb to be more common than that of any other part of that organ. Rupture bf the womb has been stated by Drs Percival and Underwood to be the consequence of a fright â€¢, it may be oiving to external violence; and, according to Lieutaud, it is sometimes the ef- fect of the placenta plugging up the mouth of the womb.

353 OT THE POSTERIOR ILIAC ARTERY. Arteria Obturatoria.—This artery is gene- rally a branch of the posterior iliac artery, but sometimes it takes its rise from the epigastric ar- tery, as has been noticed in the article Hernia, in the second volume. This artery passes along the upper edge of the obturator internus muscle, and then through the hole in the ligamentous membrane, which shuts up the foramen thyroideum. The artery then divides into external and inter- nal branches, which are 'distributed upon the ob- turator muscles, the ligament of the hip-joint, and origin of the vastus internus muscle. The l;?ri'tiches of this artery anastomose with the circumflex, and the profunda femoris. Pudenda Communis.—This artery has-been al- ready described. IscHiATic Artery.—This artery leaves the pel- vis at the lower margin of the pyriform muscle, accompanied by the sciatic nerve, and is covered by the gluteus maximus muscle. It descends in the hollow between the great trochanter of the thigh-bone and the tuberosity of the ischium, a- long with the sciatic nerve. Before leaving the pelvis, it detaches branches to the intestinum curvum, obturator internus, and pyriform muscles ; and, without the pelvis, it de- taches the arteria coccygea, which passes along the posterior sacro-sciatic ligament, and gives branches to the levator ani, coccygeus muscle, the tat and bones of the coccyx.

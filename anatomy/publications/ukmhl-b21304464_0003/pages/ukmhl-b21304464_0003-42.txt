OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 14 which Mr Wilson has described, and which arise by a double tendon from the arch of the pubes, and which unite under this part of the canal*. The urethra is then inclosed in its corpus spon- giosum, which is made up of a plexus of blood- vessels. This spongy substance, which is covered by the same cellular sheath as the corpora cavernosa pe- nis, begins in the form of a conical-shaped process, the apex of which passes oblique!)' downwards in the direction of the perineum between the crur^ penis, and it is covered below and at its sides by the accelerator urinae ; and it is connected to the arch of the pubes by a strong triangular-shaped ligament. The urethra is then firmly fixed to the corpora cavernosa, along which it passes ; and having pas- sed through the glans, it terminates in a verti- cal aperture. The diameter of the urethra is by no means uni- form ; it is largest where it passes through the pros- tate gland, the bulb of the urethra, and the glans. Mr Home has been at great pains in taking moulds of the male urethra, and has published the following measurements f. * Vide Meclico-Chirurg. Transact, of London, vol. i. t To determine with precision the length as well as width of the urethra, exact casts of it were taken in wax, stretching it in the dead body as much as it would readily bear; in this way a bougie was formed of the size of the urethra The subjects from which these casts were taken were of different ages, one I

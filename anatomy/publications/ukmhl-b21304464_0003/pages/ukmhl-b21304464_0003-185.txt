OF THE VITREOUS HUMOUR. J57 divide into two distinct layers. The external con- tinues to be glued to the retina, and accompanies it to its termination, which we shall find to be in the fore-part of the capsule of the crystalline lens, about one-twentieth of an inch from its outer edge; The internal layer adheres firmly to the vitreous humour, till this is connected with the posterior part of the capsule of the lens, at the like distance, nearly, of one-twentieth of an inch from its outer edge ; and, at the distance, therefore, of one-tenth of an inch from the connexion of its anterior layer and retina with the lens. The outer edge, there- fore, of the crystalline lens, covered with its pro- per capsule only, occupies a space nearly one-tenth of an inch in breadth, between the two layers of the capsule of the vitreous humour. “ The anterior layer of the capsule of the vitreous humour being fixed to the crystalline lens, at the distance, nearly, of one-tenth of an inch from the attachment of its posterior layer,—a canal, bound- ed by the two layers of the vitreous humour, and by the edge of the crystalline lens, as its basis, is formed, which was discovered by Dr Petit, and is named after him *. Air, blown into this space, passes, of course, around the crystalline lens f. Each of the two layers of the capsule of the vi- treous humour, is tougher than the posterior part * Mem. de I’Acad. des Sciences, 172C. t Vid. Plate xli, fig. 1.

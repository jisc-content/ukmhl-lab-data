outlines of anatomy; J02 these branches, forming networks, which, at first sight, seem to resemble the anastomoses of the . bloodvessels. 3. In certain parts of the body, several nerves enter into a knot, called a Ganglion, and from the opposite side of the knot nerves are sent out. The nerves, in their course, are united by plexuses, in which the fibres of the different nerves are intermixed, and every nerve under the plexus, consists of all the nerves which entered the plexus. Some of the nerves which run in opposite direc- tions are connected by their small branches ; as the second branch of the fifth pair of nerves, with the â€˜ portio dura of the auditory nerves. In the ox, my Father remarked that the small branches which come off beyond the union of the two larger nerves, consist of the fibres of both. In the whole nervous system, the particular cords, of which the particular nerves consist, form, according to my Father *, within their proper sheaths a succession of plexuses, in which their fibres are intermixed and combined again. Thus the danger of diseases and injuries of the trunks of the nerves is materially diminished. * Vid. Nervous System, p, 44,

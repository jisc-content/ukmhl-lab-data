'257 derangements'OF THE SKIN. the observations of Dr Will an, and have'added a very brief account of his method of arranging these. Dr WiLLAN has arranged diseases of the skin in eight orders. Order 1.â€”Papul.e*, which comprise three genera, strophulus, lichen, and prurigo. The strophulus is a papulous eruption, which ex- hibits a variety of forms, and which may be de- scribed under the titles, strophulus intertinctus or .red gum, albidus, confertus or tooth-rash, volaticus, and candid us. Lichen is defined by Dr Willan to be an ex- tensive eruption of papulae affecting adults, con- nected with internal disorder, and usually termi- nating in scurf; recurrent, but not contagious. The varieties are the simple.v, pilaris, circumscrip- tus, agrius, lividus, and tropicus, or prickly heat affecting Europeans settled in tropical climates. Prurigo. Under this genus. Dr Willan has described the mitis,foi'?nicans, and senilis. In the prurigo, the papula; are larger than in the lichen, and have nearly the same colour as the skin. * PapulsB are said by Dr Willan to be very small and acu- minated elevations of the cuticle, with an inflamed base, not t'ontaining a fluid, nor tending to suppuration.

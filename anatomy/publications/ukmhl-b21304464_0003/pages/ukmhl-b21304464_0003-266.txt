OUTLlNtS OF anatomy. 238 Order 2. comprehends Squama *, or the scaly diseases of the skin, which arise from a morbid state of the cuticle. The generic diseases of this order, are /epra, psoriasis, pityriasis, and icthy* osis. The Lepra is characterised by scaly patches of different sizes, but nearly of a circular form. Of this. Dr WiLLAN has observed three species, the vulgaris, alphoides, and nigricans. The vulgaris exhibits small distinct elevations of the cuticle, which are reddish and shining, and never contain any fluid ; and in twenty-four hours, these are covered by thin white scales. In the alphoides, the scales are smaller, and their central parts are a little depressed. In the nigricans, the colour of the patches dif- fers from that of the preceding kinds ; they are dark and livid, and are not depressed in the cen- tre ; and the skin appears of a livid colour through the scaly incrustations. Psoriasis or scaly tetter. The species of this, described by Dr Willan, are the guttata, diffii- sa, gyrata, palmaria, labialis, ophthalmica, prapu- til, scrotalis, unguium, injantilis, inveterata. * Dr Willan has thus defined a scale; a lamina of morbid cuticle ; hard, thickened ; whitish and opaque. Sciales have at first the figure and extent of the cuticular lozenge?, but after- wards often increase into irregular layers, called cntsls, whicb repeatedly fall off, and are reproduced in a short time.

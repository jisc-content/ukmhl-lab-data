OBSERVATIONS ON GENERATION. 41 the influence of one copulation extends in the plant-louse, (the aphis,) to four or five genera- tions. The germ, which is saparated, is involved in an organized mass, to which it is connected by blood- vessels, by which it is nourished. Animals are oviparous, ovo-viviparous, or vivi- parous. Birds are ovipai'ous. The chick is detached, and involved in its membranes, by the vessels of which it is nourished. The ovum of the viper is retained within the body of the mother, until the contained germ be hatched ; the viper is hence ovo-viviparous. In all the class mammalia, the young is at- tached to the internal surface of the uterus of the mother, and by her juices it is nourished for a cer- tain time, and is not born until it be capable of an independent existence. All this class is there- fore viviparous. The organs of generation of the human body are of a complicated structure. It is proposed to describe, in the Jirst place, the structure of the testes by which the semen is pre- pared, and the tubes connected with it, by which it is carried to certain receptacles, called vesicula: seminaks ; and, in the next place, The structure of the prostate gland, which prepares a fluid which is mixed with the semen ; and in the third place, The structure of the organs of copulation, bv

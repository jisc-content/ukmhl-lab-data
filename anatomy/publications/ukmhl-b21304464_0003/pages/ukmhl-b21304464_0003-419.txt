LIGATURES ON ARTERIES. 391 trufiks of the arteries may be taken up in succes-. sion in the same animal, by which the greater- share of'the blood is translated to the smaller anas- tomosing vessels and without producing any al- teration in the habits of the animal. Since the preceding observations upon the ef- fects of ligatures thrown around the arteries, were published by Mr Astley Cooper, he shewed me a preparation of a limb, in which the iliac artery had been tied for a large femo- ral aneurism, in the middle of the thigh, and in the same limb there were four other aneurisms. The man died of an aneurism which burst into B b 4 " Mr Campbell, a patient of Mr Curtis, Surgeon in White- chapel, underwent the operation for popliteal aneurism, at a time when the weather was extremely cold. In three nights after the operation, he said his foot was benumbed, and when it was examined, it was found to be of a blue colour, and quite cold. Frictions were immediately had recourse to ; first, with the hand only, and, after a time, with warm flannels, and the circulation was restored, although with considerable difficulty. “ When a ligature has been applied, it is some time before the artery below becomes obliterated. Mr Foster, Surgeon of Guy’s Hospital, has a drawing in his possession of a case of popliteal aneurism, for which the femoral artery was tied in Au- gust ; the man died in January following, and when the limb was injected, the femoral artery, below where the ligature had been applied, was found to have received a part of the injection by communicating vessels. * Vid.

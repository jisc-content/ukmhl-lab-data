III. OF THE NERVES OF THE CHYLOPOETIC AND AS- SISTANT CHYEOPOETIC VISCERA. The nerves of the chylopoetic, and assistant chylopoetic viscera, are derived from the sympa- thetic ner^e ; the par vagum of the eighth pair of nerves ; and the rami splanchnici. The Rami Splanchnisi arise from the sympa- thetic nerves ; they pass through the upper and lateral parts of the smaller diaphragm, and join the great semilunar ganglion. The Paria Vaga of the eighth pair also assist in forming the semilunar ganglion. The par vagum of the left side having passed along the gullet, gets to the fore-part of the up- per orifice of the stomach, and divides into a num- ber of small nerves, which are distributed on the

DISTRIBUTION OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 30i There is much variety as to the size and course of the inferior thyroid artery. I have seen in Dr Ramsayâ€™s Museum, a speci- men, in which this artery ascended in front of the windpipe. The vertebral artery in some cases takes its rise from the arch of the aorta ; and in some very rare instances, enters the hole in the transverse processes of the third cervical vertebra, instead of that of the sixth or seventh cervical ver- tebra. The thoracic arteries are very seldom derived from the same part of the axillary artery in diffe- rent persons. The subscapulary artery sometimes arises from the thyroid artery, and it varies also much in size. In those cases, where the transverse artery of the neck is of unusual size, this artery is generally smaller than usual. There are many irregularities observed as to the distribution of the humeral artery and its branches; and it may not be improper to add, that I have seen many examples of such unu- sual distribution of arteries in both arms of the same subject. In some instances, the humeral artery divides, in the axilla, into the radial and ulnar arteries ; in other cases, in the middle of the os humeri ; and the radial artery more frequently is sent off higher than the ulnar.

GANGLIA OF THE NERVES. 397 sympathy of nerves can depend directly on their connection in their progress. I shall conclude this Chapter by a few obser- vations respecting the Ganglia of the Nerves. Ganglia are oblong bodies of an irregular form, which are connected with the great sympathetic nerve chiefly *. In some of the ganglia, there is a peculiar kind of cellular membrane, and also fat. The bulk of the ganglion exceeds very much that of all the nerves or bloodvessels which it re- ceives, which led Winslow f, Morgagni J, and also Wrisberg, to suppose, that in ganglia the different nervous filaments are intimately inter- mixed, and also that a new arrangement of the medullary substance takes places within them. The nerves to which the ganglia are attached, are distributed upon organs of involuntary mo- tion ; and though these are not under the domi- nion of the will, yet there is no peculiar me- chanism, no peculiarity in the muscular structure * Haller, speaking of the Sympathetic Nerves, has ob- served, “ Super omnes nervos ganglia sunt frequentissiraa, in. cervice quidem tria j in thorace, lumbis, ct pelvi tot, quot ner- vorum ex spinali medulla propagines intercostalis accepit: turn in cordis vicinia, sub diaphragmatc, circa arteriac cceliacae et me- sentericae originem, et circa renem passim in plexubus rctibiis.“ Element.

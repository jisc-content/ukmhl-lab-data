SClRRHUS OF THE UTERUS. 93 Tubercles sometimes grow from the uterus, and more frequently polypi, which sometimes at- tain a large bulk, and by their weight produce prolapsus uteri. The polypi which grow from the uterus, are similar to those which have been already de- scribed, as attached to the alimentary canal. The uterus is also the seat of the fungus hae- matodes, a tumour which bears a strong resem- blance in its colour to the brain, and containing cysts filled by bloody serum. Moles sometimes are found within the uterus, and the latter have been discharged, and the pa- tient has become pregnant. Earthy concretions have been described in the uterus. The uterus has sometimes been ruptured at the time of delivery. Hydatids have sometimes been contained in the uterus ; by which it is much enlarged. These hydatids have sometimes been artifi- cially removed, as in the case alluded to in the second volume, and the patient has obtained a complete recovery. Water is sometimes collected within the uterus j and if such a patient menstruates, the menses are pale and watery. In some instances, the water is for a time re- tained, but in others it comes away in gushes.

169 OF THE PUNCTA LYCRYMALIA. Of the Puncta Lacrymalia *. There are two puncta lacrymalia, a superior and inferior, through which the tears pass into the la- crymal sac. Each punctum is surrounded by a cartilaginous border, by which it is kept always open. The superior punctum is placed near to the in- ner angle of the eye, of the upper eye-lid ; it ascends for about one-eighth of an inch, and then turns inwards at a right angle ; then ascends ob- liquely. The inferior punctum passes downwards ; describes an acute angle, and then passes obliquelj upwards. The puncta approach each other; they'are se- parated by the caruncle, and sometimes form a common duct behind the tendon of the orbicularis muscle ; but in most ca^es the puncta open into the lacrymal sac separately f. The tears are absorbed by the puncta, in con- sequence of capillary attraction, and conveyed through the ducts into the lacrymal sac. * Vide Plate 6. of my Father’s Treatise on the Eye and La- crymal Ducts. + Vide a description of these ducts in Dr Monro senior’s Obs. Anat. & Phys. published 1758.

MALCONFORMATION OF THE HEART. ‘ 46l described by Mr Wilson, teacher of anatomy in London The heart resembled that of an amphibious animal, and consisted only of one auricle and one ventricle ; and, from the latter, a large artery was derived, which ascended into the chest, where it divided into two branches ; the one of which, was bent like the arch of the aorta, and the other was r distributed upon the lungs ; and from the lungs, the blood was returned by two veins which joined the vena cava superior, and entered the heart along with it. ■ The last species of malconformation, is that in which the mitral valve is imperfect, leaving mere- ly a small opening between the left auricle and ventricle. This kind of malconformation has been particularly described by Mr Allan Burns. He has observed, “ I have only seen three cases of this kind, in two of them, the mitral valve, instead of being formed of two flaps, presented only the appearance of a septum, stretching across the opening from the auricle into the ventricle, having in the centre an aperture of larger or smaller size, through which the blood passed from the one cavity into the other f.” * Phil.

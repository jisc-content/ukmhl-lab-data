276 .OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Besides the above sinuses, there is frequently found a perpendicular occipital sinus, situated in the falx cerebelli, which is sometimes double. The lateral sinuses pass out from the skull at the foramina lacera posteriora in busi cranii, and join with the internal jugular veins, and are in- closed in the same cellular sheath as the carotid arteries. The internal jugular veins receive the internal maxillary veins, the occipital, lingual, pharyngeal, superior and inferior laryngeal veins ; and a few branches from the muscles of the neck, and at last terminate in the subclaviâ€™an veins. Sect. Vllf. OF VARIETIES AS TO THE ORIGIN AND COURSE OF THE ARTERIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. There are generally three large arteries, which take their rise from the arch of the aorta; the Arteria Innominata, common to the right Carotid and Subclavian arteries ; the Left Carotid, andLcit Subclavian, which come off by separate trunks. In a very few cases, four arterial trunks take their rise from the arch of the aorta; and in some cases only two. There is also considerable difference as to the length of the arteria innominata ; in general, when

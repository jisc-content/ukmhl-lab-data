OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 194 • ‘•'I CHAPTER VI. OF THE ORGAN OF TASTE. t TnHE Tongue is the seat of the sense of taste : and is proportionally broader in man than in quadrupeds. The structure of the human tongue has been explained in a preceding volume.’ I therefore shall only observe, that the papillae which cover its surface, render it a still more per- fect organ of taste, to which the thinness of the cuticle, which covers the surface of the tongue, essentially contributes. The tongue, like the other organs of sense, is very largely supplied by bloodvessels and nerves. 'I'he tongue is supplied with blood by the ar- teria ranina, a branch of the internal carotid. The tongue receives its nerves from three diffe- rent sources ; from the 5th, 8th, and qth pairs of nerves. The upper part, and also the point of the tongue, is supplied by a branch of the inferior maxillary branch of the fifth pair of nerves.

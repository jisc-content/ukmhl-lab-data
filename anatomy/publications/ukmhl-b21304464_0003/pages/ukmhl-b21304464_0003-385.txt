BRANCHES OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. 357 and, about the middle of the thigh, is situated on the triangular space between the vastus internus muscle and the second head of the abductor mus- cle ; and the sartorius muscle passes across it. The Profunda Femoris, situated behind the superficial femoral, passes backwards, and is situa- ted in the triangular cavity between the iliacus in- ternus and pectineus muscle. The following '.branches are derived from the arteria profunda femoris. The External CiRcu mflex, which passes under the sartorius and rectus muscles, and towards the root of the great trochanter, is distributed on the rectus cruris ; and, perforating the fascia of the thigh, is spent on the skin over the hip. A large branch passes down the inside of the vastus inter- ims, and communicates with the superior articular artery of the knee. The Internal Circumflex sinks deep be- tween the pectineus, iliacus internus, and psoas muscles j it then passes into the space between the greater and lesser trochanter. An external pudic artery is sometimes derived from the internal circumflex, but more commonly from the superficial femoral artery. This artery crosses the upper portions of the pectineus and gracilis muscle, and is subdivided into a number of small branches, which are dis- tributed upon the inguinal glands, the scrotum, and pubes.

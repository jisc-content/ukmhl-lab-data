CHAPTER I. OF THE ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE SPINAL MARROW. As the Spinal Marrow and Brain are of a simi- lar structure, the organic derangements of these organs are very analogous. On account of the remarkable degree of symi- pathy and connection betwixt the spinal marrow and brain, diseases originating in the spinal mar- row, may be propagated to the brain, or vice â€¢versa. The spinal marrow may suffer, not only from' violence directly applied, but also from a shock communicated to it, as by falling on the breech, knees, or even on the feet.

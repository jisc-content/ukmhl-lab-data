OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 390 have contributed to the introduction of the new and improved method of treating aneurisms, Mr Astley Cooper has prosecuted this subject with his usual and laudable zeal, by making ex- periments on animals, which have proved many of the remarks of my Father, and have also thrown new light upon the subject. He has proved, that even the aorta itself may be taken up by ligature, in a sound animal, and that the blood still continues to be carried on in the posterior extremities * ; that the principal • “ Any great increase in diameter of the anastomosing vessels is but slowly produced, for I have injected a limb several weeks after the operation for popliteal aneurism, without being able to force the injection through communicating vessels into the parts below. To enlarge the vessels much, it is necessary that the limb should have been employed in active exertion. On account of the arteries not very readily enlarging, the limbs of those who have undergone the operation for aneurism, are for a considerable time weaker than natural. They feel the influence of cold more, are more disposed to ulcerate from slight causes, and when sores are produced, have diminished powers of restoration. On account of the languor of circulation and the diminished power of resisting the influence of low de- grees of heat, it is right, after the operation for aneurism, to clothe that limb much warmer than the other; for which pur- pose, a piece of flannel or a fleecy stocking should be applied, to prevent tlie sedative influence of cold. “ A man, who had undergone the operation for popliteal aneurism, complained in the evening of his leg being painful, and a dresser going through the ward, applied a lotion of the acetate of lead, and when the rags were removed on the follow- ing morning, the limb was found mortified.

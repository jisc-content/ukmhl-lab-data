309 nerves of the neck, &c. Tiie Sub-occipital Nerves take their rise from the beginning of the spinal marrow-by an ante- rior and postefior fasciculus. These nerves, after their exit from the spinal canal, are connected with the ninth pah’, and with the first cervical nerve ; and their branches are distributed upon the recti and oblique muscles of the head. The First Cervical Nerve passes out between the first and second vertebra«of the neck, and di- vides into two large branches. The one furnishes nerves to the extensor muscles of the head and neck, and then ascends upon the occiput, dividing into many branches, whjch are distributed upon the back-part of the head. The other bremch is \mited with the accessory nerve, the ninth pair of nerves, and uppermost ganglion of the sympa- thetic nerve, from \t?hich a nerve is sent'down- wards to the second cervical ganglion. The Second Cervical Nerve, after passing between the vertebras, is united to the middle gan- glion of the sympathetic nerve, and also to the third cervical nerve. • This pair of nerves also sends brtfnches to the sterno-mastoid muscle ; a branch, which passes downwards along the jugular vein ; a third branch, which assists^in forming the phrenic nerve •, a fourth branch, w'hich divides into many branches, viz. the inferior cutaneous nerve, •wdiich supplies the parts of the lower jaw ; tlie middle cutaneous nerve, U 3

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 472 In this hernia, the displaced bowels are situated within the canal, through which the testes pass from the abdomen into the scrotum, which, though commonly obliterated, sometimes remains open during the whole of life. The nature of this kind of hernia was long un- known. We are chiefly indebted to Baron Hal- ler, Wrisberg, Mr Pott, and to Dr and Mr J. Hunter, for our knowledge on this head. There is much irregularity as to the period at which the canal, through which the testes pass,-is obliterated. Dr Camper has published the following obser- vations on the subject; he examined for that pur- pose the bodies of seventeen new-born male chil- dren. In eleven, the canal was open on both sides ; in three, a portion on the right side was open ; and in two, a portion on the left side was open ; and in one only, the canal was obliterated on both sides. Professor Wrisberg also has published many valuable observations on the descent of the testes, to which I beg leave to refer the reader *. There is frequently a stricture in the middle of the canal through which the testes pass. In a case of this description, which I dissected, there was a stricture in the middle of the canal, jmd a part of the omentum had got beyond the * Vid. Comment. Soc. Reg- Sclent. Getting.

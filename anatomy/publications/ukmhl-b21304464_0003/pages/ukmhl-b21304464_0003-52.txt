OUTLINES'of ANx»lTOMY. The form and size of urinary concretions, gene- rally depend upon the shape of the cavities con- taining them ; hence those found vi'ithin the pelvis of the kidney, sometimes assume an arborescent ap- pearance, having taken a mould of the pelvis, and infundibula of the kidney •, and hence calculi of the bladder are generally of a round or oval figure. There is generally only one calculus within the bladder, and it is of an oval form, and smooth on its surface. The average weight of eighty calculi in the Museum of the University, is between two and three ounces; but sometimes they attain a much larger size and weight,,ten, twelve, twenty, thirty ounces, or even more. When there are two or more concretions within the bladder, they are generally of a small size, of a yellow or brown colour, and they impress each other more or less, and sometimes to such a de- gree, as to resemble a cup and ball. The state of the surface of the calculus, therefore, merits attention, as we thus distinguish whether there is only one or more calculi within the bladder of urine. The dark-coloured moriform calculi are in ge- neral smallest, but are, in proportion to their bulk, the heaviest; whereas those of a white colour, ge- nerally acquire a larger size*. * In the collection of urinary concretions, which Mr Four- CROY shewed me, there was a much greater proportion of large white concretions, than in any of the Museums of Britain, I have had an opportunity of examining.

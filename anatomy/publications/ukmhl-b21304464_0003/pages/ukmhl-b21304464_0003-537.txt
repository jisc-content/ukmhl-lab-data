509 EXPLANATION OF PLATES. salt would proceed with increased rapidity. And in all the stages of the formation of this calculus, there would be equal danger and difficulty of treat- • ment. Thus the medicines which dissolve the mul- berry calculus, precipitate uric acid, and vice versa. From various circumstances, from our knowledge of their composition, and the assemblage of dif- ferent kinds in one stone ; from the action of acids and alkalies upon calculi, and from the effects which these powerful agents have produced, when given as lithontriptics, it may be concluded, that acids and alkalies are never beneficial, when pre- scribed with the intention of dissolving a stone already formed, and that alkalies are only service- able when given as general medicines, to correct acidities,, and to repair the deranged digestive powers. These conclusions were first made by Mr Brande, in an excellent paper, published in the Philosophical Transactions, in which he afforded ample proof of the success of magnesia, given in- ternally, in preventing the formation of uric cal- culous matter.” Fig. 3.—represents a urinary concretion, which . weighed fourteen ounces, and which was ex- tracted from the bladder by the late Mr Alexan- jiER Wood.

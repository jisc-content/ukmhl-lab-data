1R.IS OR MOVEABLE CURTIN. 151 * Treatise on the Brain, &c. p. Ill, 112. Sphincter and root of the iris, the space is filled up with vessels and radiated fibres*.‚Äù The iris divides the aqueous humour into two chambers, an anterior and a posterior ; the ante- rior is placed between the posterior surface of the cornea and the anterior part of the iris. The posterior chamber is situated between the posterior surface of the iris and the anterior part of the crystalline lens. The iris receives its blood by the long ciliary ar- teries. The long ciliary arteries which supply the op- posite sides of the iris freely anastomose with each other ; and the smaller vessels of the iris form a circle around the pupil. The iris is supplied with nerves by the branches of the ciliary nerves; and these are large and nu- merous, in proportion to the bulk of the organ. The motions of the iris are involuntary, and de- pend on the quantity of light which falls on the retina ; for light falling on the iris itself produces no motion. Upon examining a minute object, the pupil is contracted, to exclude the most diver- gent rays of light, which could not be united up- on the retina. But in some animals, as the par- rot, the movements of the iris are voluntary. -K 4

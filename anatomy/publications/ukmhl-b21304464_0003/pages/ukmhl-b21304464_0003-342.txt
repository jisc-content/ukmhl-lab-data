314 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. There is another comiderabk branch sent off from the nerve before if passes into the palm of the hand, which runs along the ulnar side of the little finger, and is subdivided into two branches ; one of which runs on the side of the little finger next the ring-finger, and the other on the side of the ting-finger next the little^finger. The trunk of the ulnar nerve passes over the annular ligament of the wrist along with the ul- nar artery ; and having reached the palm of the hand, is subdivided into superficial and deep,-sea led branches; the former of which is distributed up- on the muscles of the little finger, and the op* posite sides of the little finger. ^ The deeper-seated branches of the ulnar nerve in the palm of the hand, pass between the ab- ductor and flexor parvus minimi digiti, and then form an arch, which accompanies the branches of the radial artery ; and from this deep-seated^ arch, there are branches derived, which supply the abductor minimi digiti, the flexor brevis, ab- ductor pollicis, lumbricales, and interossei mus- cles. ' From the branches of the nerves which supply the fingers, there are many lateral branches, which are distributed upon the muscles of the fingers, and which at last terminate upon the points of the fingers, by a number of srnall fibrils. There are many anastomoses between the smal- o ler branches of the radial and ulnar nerves*.

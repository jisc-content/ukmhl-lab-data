OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. through the lungs; whereas supposing the fora- men ovale, canalis arteriosus and pulmonary arte-, ry to have transmitted equal quantities of the blood, the same proportion of blood passes in the same time through both auricles and ventricles of the heart; the purpose of which is obvious, as af- ter birth they are intended to transmit equal quan- tities of blood. Hence, too, in consequence of the existence of two passages, both auricles and both ventricles re- ceive blood, which has passed through the system of the mother, and has undergone the necessary changes. There is considerable difficulty in explaining, why the umbilical vein is connected with the ve- na portarum, and not directly with the vena cava, and also why the canalis venosus is of smaller diameter than the umbilical vein, and does not cor- respond with both umbilical arteries. The umbilical vein probably is connected to the vena portarum, in order that its contents may be more equally divided between the two princi- pal veins, the vena cava and vena portarum. If the whole of the blood had gone to the vena por- tarum, the liver could not well have transmitted it; and if the whole had gone to the vena cava, the liver would not have been prepared for the in- creased quantity of blood passing into the coeliac and mesenteric arteries, when a ligature is thrown around the umbilical arteries after birth. Ano- ther reason may be, that the umbilical vein pro-

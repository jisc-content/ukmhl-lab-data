DEK.ANGEMENtS OF THE NEIIVES. 409 Br Haighton’'^. Meyer, taking advantage of the observations of Professor Reil f, that the ni- tric acid dissolves the coats and cellular substance of the nerves, but not their medullary matter, dis- tinctly proved that the nerves are rejoined by real nervous matter. He divided the left sciatic nerve of an animal; the wound healed in a short time, and the animal regained the sensibility and power of moving its limb. Upon dissection, the divided nerve was immersed in the nitric acid, and was found reunited by real nervous matter. The nerves have also been said to inflame vio^ lently ; which inflammation is succeeded by sup- puration. Soemmering has made mention of what he calls Corruptio Nervi. “ Corruptus nervus gra- cilior fit, brevior, firmior, simul atque durior, se- miperlucidus, cartilaginis in modum, coloremque cinereum induit.

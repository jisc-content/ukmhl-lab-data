DERANGEMENTS OF THE EAR. CHAPTER VII. OF THE ORGA'NIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE, EAR. THE external ear is much exposed to external injury. When divided partially, it may be readily reunited. The external ear has sometimes been much swelled in consequence of erysipelas, herpes, and other cutaneous disorders, especially during infan- cy ; and insects and other extraneous bodies have sometimes stuck in the meatus auditorius exter- nus. Wax, which becomes very hard, is sometimes accumulated in such quantity within the external passage, and upon the membrane of the drum, as to occasion dullness of hearing. The membrane of the drum is occasionally the seat of inflammation. Polypi sometimes grow from the membrane of the drum. There is in some instances an aperture in the membrane of the drum.

101 ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 'which has been called Neurilema^ which may be distinctly seen after removing the medullary mat- ter, by immersing the nerve in an alkaline solution. A number of small bloodvessels are distributed upon the neurilema. The proper nervous substance, when laid bare> appears generally of a cineritious colour ; and when examined by the aid of a magnifying glass, seems to consist of a semipellucid substance, in which a more white and opake fibrous-looking matter is disposed in transverse and serpentine lines. These serpentine transverse lines are most dis- tinct when the nerve is relaxed, but are much less evident upon the nerve being moderately stretch- ed ; and when the nerve is much stretched, it ap- pears uniform in its colour and consistence. Hence, my Father has concluded that by these lines, the nerve is accommodated to the different stages of flexion and extension of the limb. Sect. II. OF THE PLEXUSES OF THE NERVES. The nerves are connected in three different â€¢ways. 1. Nerves are joined together at acute angles, and form plexuses. 2. Nerves, running in opposite directions, are connected by their small branches, or apices of . G3

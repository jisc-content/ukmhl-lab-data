GF THIS IICTER.NAL CAROTID ARTERY. 269 The Lateral Nasal Artery, is also derived from the internal maxillary; it passes through the spheno-palatine hole to supply the nose and pitui- tary membrane which lines the nose, the ethmoidal cells, the septum narium, the ossa turbinata, an- trum maxillare, and communicates with the pala- to-maxillary artery. Sect. V. OF THE INTERNAL CAROTID OR CEREBRAL ARTERY. The Internal Carotid Artery, follows a tortuous course upon the rectus capitis major mus- cle, before entering the carotid canal. The artery having passed through the above canal, is directed upwards ; then turns horizon- tally ; enters the cavernous sinus, and perforates the dura mater, at the side of the anterior clinoid process of the sphenoid bone. This artery sends small branches to the dura mater, to the cavernous sinus, and small branches which accompany the third, fourth and fifth pairs of nerves. When the internal carotid artery has perforated the dura mater, it sends off the Ocular, or Oph- THAX.MIC Artery. â€¢ ,

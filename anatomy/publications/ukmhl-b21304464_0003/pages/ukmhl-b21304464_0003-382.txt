A small branch of this artery communicates with the perforating branches of the arteria pro- funda femoris. Of the Anterior Iliac Artery and its Brajiches, The trunk of this artery sweeps along the in- ner edge of the psoas muscle, and is situated on the outer side of the vein ; it passes beneath the crural arch, and is then called /morfl/ artery. There are two considerable branches detached from the anterior iliac artery before it leaves the pelvis, the Epigastric Artery and Circumflex of the Os Ilium. There is much variety as to the origin of the epigastric artery, (as has been explained in the ar- ticle on Hernia) : generally it takes its rise about an inch from the crural arch ; it is.then reflected upwards and inwards behind the spermatic chord, and on the inner-side of the upper abdominal aper- ture. The artery then passes behind the rectus abdominis muscle, and ascends to meet with the smaller branches of the internal mammary artery, upon the back-part of the rectus abdominis. The epigastric artery sends a small branch, which is distributed upon the pubal side of Gim- bernat’s ligament; a second, which passes through

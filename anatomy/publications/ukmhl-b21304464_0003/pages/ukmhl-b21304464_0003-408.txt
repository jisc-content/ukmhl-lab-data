OUTLINES.OF ANATOMY. 380 The wonderful extent of the power of the anastomosing vessels, has only of late been fully ascertained. Modern investigation and experiment have proved, that an obstruction of the aorta or vena cava, does not prove fatal. A case is detailed at considerable length in Volume Second of M. Desault’s Journal, in which the aorta below its arch was much eon^ tracted. He says, “ qu’ elle avoit tout-au-plus la grosseur d’ un tuyau de plume a ecrire.” He has added, ' La partie de cette artere qui se trouvoit au des- sus du retrdcissement, etoit ^ peine delatee, et celle qui etoit au dessous conservit son calibre ordinaire.” The subclavian artery, and its branches, the ex- ternal thoracic, the internal mammary, the lower intercostal derived from the aorta, and the epigas- tric arteries, were much enlarged, and, with the exception of the first artery, were tortuous. In short, in this very remarkable instance, the greater part of the blood, instead of reaching the inferior extremities by the medium of the usual channel, the aorta, had descended by the internal mammary and epigastric arteries. Mr Astley Cooper has repeatedly thrown ligatures upon the aortae of dogs, of which he has published the following account:

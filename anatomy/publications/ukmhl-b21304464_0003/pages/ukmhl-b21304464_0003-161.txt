ARTERIES OP THE BRAIN. 18S From the tuber annulare, the Medulla oblonga- ta, which resembles a cone, with its base next to the tuber annulare, takes its rise : it extends to the foramen magnum ossis occipitis; and upon the surface of the medulla on each side, there are two eminences disposed longitudinally; the one like an olive, the other like a pyramid ; hence the terms corpora pyramidalia and olvcaria. Sect. IV. OF THE ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN. The brain is supplied with blood from four dif- ferent sources, by the vertebral and internal ca- rotid arteries: These arteries follow a tortuous course before entering the brain, in order that the blood may not be sent with too great force to that delicate and important organ; and they communicate frequently and freely with each other. Sect. V, or THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. THE veins of the brain do not follow the same course as the arteries : they lead to the venous sinuses, enveloped by the dura mater, which are so constructed, and so situated, that they can nei- ther be over-distended nor compressed.

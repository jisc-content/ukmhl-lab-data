derangements of the skin. 25^9 k The following brief description may communi- cate a general idea of the disease. The names express the form of the patches or stripes ; their seat; the period of life at which they appear, or the inveteracy of the disease. The complaint begins in small distinct scales, with little or no inflammation around them. The patches are seldom as large as a sixpence; They have not an elevated border, and their cir- cumference is angular. Pityriasis consists of irregular patches of thin slight scales, which are repeatedly produced and separated, but never - produce crusts. Dr Wil- LAN has described the pityriasis capitis^ rubra^ and â€¢versicolor. Icthyosis is a permanently harsh, dry, scaly, and in some cases almost horny texture of the integu- ments, unconnected with internal disorder. The 3d Order of DrWiLLAN comprehends the Exanthemata or Rashes * ; some of which are contagious, others not, and some are attended by symptomatic fever : Some continue for a definite time ; others return at uncertain intervals. * Rash, according to Dr Willan, consists of red patches on the skin, variously figured ; in general confluent, and diffused irregularly over the body, leaving interstices of a natural co- lour. Portions of cuticle are often elevated in a rash, so as to give tlie sensation of an uneven surface. The eruption is ge- nerally accompanied with disorder of the constitution, and ter- minates in a few daj's by cuticular exfoliations.

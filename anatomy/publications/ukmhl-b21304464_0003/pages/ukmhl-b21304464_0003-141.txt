OF SENSATION. 113 vessels, with which the other branches of the ner- vous system sympathise. The next point to be considered, is, JVhether 'the nervous energy is produced by a fluid, of the same nature with, or nearly resembling that called Electrical? as has been of late years supposed by many eminent physiologists; especially since the power of the torpedo of giving an electrical shock was discovered by Mr Walsh, and the effects of animal electricity by Galvani. That the matter rendered active by the torpedo or gymtiotus, is electrical, appears highly probable or certain, by the experiments of Mr Walsh. The matter set loose in animal electricity, re- sembles so exactly the electrical, in its velocity, and in passing through or being stopped by the same substances, and in producing convulsions in the muscles of animals ; that it does not appear to me that there are just grounds for doubting of their identity. But after so much is granted, it by no means follows, that the nervous energy, or fluid, as it has been called, is electrical, or that an electrical fluid, by its direct influence, produces the convulsions of the muscles. On the contrary, my Father has endeavoured to demonstrate by experiments, that the electrical and nervous matter arc essentially different from each other ; and that, in Galvaniâ€™s experiments, the electrical matter merely proved u stimulus to the nerves.

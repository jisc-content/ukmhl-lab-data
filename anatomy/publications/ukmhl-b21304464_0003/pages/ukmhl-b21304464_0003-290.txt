Sect. III. OF THE AORTA AND CORONARY ARTERIES. The Aorta, immediately after its exit from the heart, is somewhat expanded. Behind the valves of the heart, two arteries, which are dis- tributed upon the heart, called Coronary, take their origin.

This artery detaches branches to the aor- ta, pulmonary artery, and to the auricle of the heart.

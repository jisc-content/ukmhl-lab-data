OF JHE DUCTU3 INCISIVDS. 171 • ■ s ' W' V ' the fore-part of the septum narium, passes to the inner corner of the eye, and is distributed upon the lacrymal sac. Of the Ductm IncuvviiSy or Passage from the Nose into the Mouth, This duct opens behind the incisor teeth of the upper jaw, into the mouth ; and hence has been cal- led ductus incisivus The groove for this duct is more or less distinct in different skulls ; somer times it is very manifest, but on other occasions superficial; and my Father observes, that “ in by far the greater number of human subjects, of dif- ferent ages, I have not b^een able to fijid any ves- tige of such ducts, in the bottom of the nose, or roof of the mouth ; But, in a few subjects, I have found them, open at both ends, but always very much smaller than in the quadruped. In spme of these, I passed a bristle or small probe, very readily, from the nose into the mouth. In two or three subjects, I first poured quicksilver from the nose, through the ductus incisivus, into the mouth ; and then, with a small syringe, injected through it melted wax, coloured with vermilion : And these preparations, which I have preserved and demonstrated for a great number of years, are accurately delineated in Table vi. fig. 4, 5, 6, 7.” • Vid.

OF THE DURA MATER. 121 The brain is also covered by three V:oats, cal- led the dura mater, the arachnoid coat, and pia mater. The dura mater adheres very intimately to the internal table of the skull, by a number of bloodvessels afid cellular threads, especially at the sutures. Of the Dura Mater. The Dura Mater, which has been so named, as it has been supposed to be the origin of all other serous insensible membranes, gives a general co- vering to the brain. The hemispheres of the brain and cerebellum are separated from each other by partitions, derived from the dura mater; and there is also a horizontal or middle septum between the posterior part of the larger brain and little brain, which is derived from the same source. The dura mater is composed of two layers; and between its component layers, the venous sinuses of the brain are lodged. Upon the upper surface of the dura mater, there are small bodies, which have been described by Pacchioni as being glandular. The superior vertical process of the dura mater, called, from its form, the Falx Cerebri^ separates to a certain extent the hemispheres 'of the brain. It is fixed to the crista galli of the ethmoid bone; becomes gradually broader as it extends backwards; adheres at its upper part to the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones; and is at length fixed to

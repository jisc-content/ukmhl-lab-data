EXPLANATION OF PLATES. 503 Fig. 2.—represents the surface of the same concretion. “ Fig. 3.—represents a calculus takeirfrom the kidney. From a section of it, it appears to be com- posed of successive layers of whitish and of brown- ish matter, which is soft, and of an earthy texture. The brown layers are too thin to be individually examined ; most probably they are chiefly uric acid. The mixture of the two, principally con- sists of ammoniaco-magnesian phosphat, uric acid, phosphat of lime, and water. The presence of ammoniaco-magnesian phosphat, is easily ascertain- ed. It is soluble in oxalic acid, as well as in the nitric and muriatic ; and by ammonia, it is pre- cipitated from them all, unaltered. It is not in- flammable. Heated, it affords water and caustic ammonia, and ammonia is also evolved when it is acted on by either of the fixed alkalies.” % Fig. 4.— This figure represents a concretion, which is of a rounded form, and with an uneven surface. Fig. 5.—represents a concretion taken from the bladder, which was of a very uncommon form, externally white and friable, and internally it con- tained a concretion of a dark brown colour. I i 4

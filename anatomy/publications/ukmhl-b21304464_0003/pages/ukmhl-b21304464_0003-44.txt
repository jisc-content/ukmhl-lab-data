OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 10 The glans is made up chiefly of a plexus of small convoluted veins, which communicate with the cor- pus spongiosum urethrae, and is^covered by a very fine and vascular skin, upon which there are a number of villi. The glans is besmeared by a fluid (said to be sebaceous) which is described by Morgagni f and Haller, as being derived from hard white small bodies, situated about the corona glandis, called glamlula: odorjfene. The glans is covered by the skifi which is fe- flected from the glans, so that it covers the glans when the penis is relaxed, and hence has been called prepuce ; which prepuce is fixed below to the glans by means of a fraenum, which prevents the over-retraction of the glans. The penis is supplied with blood ftom the ar- teriae pudendae •, and the veins of the penis unite, and form a large venous trunk, which passes in- to a plexus of veins, which lie in the vicinity of the prostate gland.

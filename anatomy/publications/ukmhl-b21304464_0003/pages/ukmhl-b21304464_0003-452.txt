OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 424 The chorion is considerably thicker in the ear- lier than in the more advanced stages of pregnan- cy, and is covered by flocculi of different lengths and thickness, which in a short time disappear, excepting in the upper part, where they contribute to form the placenta. one of wliich passes between the placenta and the inner surface of the uterus, and the other forms the decidua reflexa, which covers the outer surface of the chorion. The decidua envelop- ing the ovum, does not, however, merely cover the shaggy ves- ' sels of the chorion at their outward floating extremities, but aK so the whole of their external surface, as deep as the chorion. “ The chorion itself commonly appears transparent, and not covered by any layer of decidua immediately applied to it. It sometimes, ho%vever, although I believe very rarely, appears to be distinctly covered with a thin layer of decidua; and, there- fore, in those cases where it seems to be wanting, it may not improbably be supposed to be so very thin as to escape observa- tion. " What is now said, however, is to be considered as merely • conjectural. " Where the decidua reflexa is beginning to pass over the chorion, there is, at an early period of pregnancy, an angle formed between it and the decidua, which lines the uterus ; and liere the decidua is often extremely thin, and perforated with small openings, so as to look like a piece of lace. In proportion as pregnancy advances, the decidua reflexa becomes gradually thinner and thinner, so that, at the fourth month, it forms an extremely fine layer covering the chorion. “ It comes at the same time more closely in contact with the decidua, which lines that part of the uterus to which the placen- 1 ta is not fixed, till at length they adhere together • See Dr Hunter’s Anatomical Description of the Human Gravid Uterus find its contents ; published by Dr BAii,riE, p. 80. & 81,

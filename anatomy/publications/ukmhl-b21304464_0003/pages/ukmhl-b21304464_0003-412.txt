384 ouTLiNis OF Anatomy. My Father has contributed considerably to the improved method of treating aneurisms ; of which, the popliteal, although they were still capable of receiving blood, derived it, not from the popliteal artery, but from the communi- cating vessels of the profunda. " The arteria profunda formed the new channel for the blood. Considerably enlarged in its diameter, although still not equal in size to the femoral artery at the groin> it took its usual course to the back of the thigh on the inner side of the thigh- bone, and sent branches of a larger size than usual to the dexor muscles of the leg, and just midway on the back of the thigh, it began to send off those arteries which became the support of • the new circulation. " The first artery'sent off, passed down close to the back of the thigh-bone, and entered the two superior articular branches of the popliteal arteiy, which vessels supply the upper part of the knee-joint. '' The second new large vessel arising from the profunda at the same part with the former, passed down by the inner side of the biceps muscle to an artery of the popliteal, which was distributed to the gastrocnemius muscle, whilst a third artery dividing into several branches, passed down with the sciatic nerve behind the knee-joint, and some of its branches um'ted themselves with the inferior articular arteries of the popliteal, with some recurrent branches of those arteries, with arteries passing to the gas- trocnemii, and, lastly, with the origin of the anterior and pos- terior tibial arteries: and these new large communicating branches were readily distinguished from others by their tortOous; course. “ It appears then, that it is those branches of the profunda, which accompany the sciatic nerve, that are the principal sup- porters of the new circulation. They were five in number, be- sides the two deep-seated arteries, which do not accompany the nerve.

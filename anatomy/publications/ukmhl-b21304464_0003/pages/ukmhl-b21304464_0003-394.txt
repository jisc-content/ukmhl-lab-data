366 .OUTLINES OF ANATOMY.â€™ This artery passes under the flexor longus pol- licis pedis, anastomoses with the plantar arch, and gives a branch, which supplies the outer-side of the great toe, and one side of the toe next to it. The Plantaris Externa, which is larger than the internal plantar artery, passes between the flexor brevis digitorum pedis, and flexor acces- sorius, till it reaches the metatarsal bone of the little toe. This artery detaches a branch to the under and outer part of the heel, which communicates with the branches of the anterior tibial and fibular ar- teries, and several branches to the flexor muscles of the toes. This artery forms an arch between the flexor muscles, and the metatarsal bones of the small toes, and the root of the great-toe ; and from that arch, branches are sent to the interossei muscles, also three large digital branches, which, at the root of the toes, divide into two branches, which supply each side of the toes; and which, at the points of the toes, are united. The perforating branch of the anterior tibial artery, joins the plantar arch, so as to form a free communication between the arteries of the upper and under side of the foot.

153 HUMOURS OF THE EYE. pH, and its posterior part is imbedded in the vi- treous humour. The human crystalline lens varies in colour and figure at different periods of life; in the foetus it is reddish, and nearly spherical; in middle life, transparent, and in figure like a double convex lens, which is more convex behind than before ; but in old age it frequently acquires a topaze co- lour, and becomes much firmer than at a more early period of life. The crystalline lens is a soft tender substance, of unequal density ; in the centre, it is firmer, tougher and heavier, than in its circumference; and hence possesses a more equable refractive power than any artificial lens. My Father, in his Trea- tise on the Eye, has observed ; It has been ve- ry generally supposed, by anatomists and by opti- cians, that the refractive power of the crystalline lens, compared with that of water, is proportion- ed nearly to its density; or, that its power ex- ceeds that of water somewhat, on accourft of the inflammable matter which enters into its compo- sition *. But different considerations, and parti- * Halleh, in Elem. Phys. vol. v. lib. xvi, p. 402. â€œ Par- vam esse qua aquam superat, prserogativam, nuperi fatentur.

» OF THt UTERUS OR WOMB. ' 67 but in debilitated women they continue to flow for six or seven days. The quantity of fluid dischar- ged is also various; it is greater in warm than in cold climates; in the former, not more than * iv. or g V,; but in the latter, double that quantity. It has been much disputed, whether the men- Jes are derived from the vagina or uterus. I have seen the menses, in cases of prolapsus uteri, flow- ing from the vessels of the uterus ; we then also observe the mucous membrane of the uterus softer than usual, covered with villi; and can also some- times see open pores from which blood is dischar- ged. Mr Brande has lately analysed the “ menstru- ous discharge, collected from a woman with pro- lapsus uteri, and consequently perfectly free from admixture of other secretions. It had the pro- perties of a very concentrated solution of the colouring matter of the blood in a diluted serum.”—“ Although,” he adds, “ I could detect no traces of iron, by the usual modes of anal_ysis, minute portions of that metal may, and probably do exist in it, as well as in the other animal fluids which I have examined ; but the abundance of colouring matter in this secretion should have af- forded a proportional quantity of iron, did any connection exist between them *.” £ 2 * Lond.

NERVES OF THE ARM. 8U ■ It may not be improper to add, that, under the axilla, the ulnar and spiral nerves are united by small branches, from which union, a small branch is sent, which' passes under the skin which covers the triceps muscle *. 7th, The Spiral Nerve, the largest nerve de- rived from the axillary plexus, is placed be- tween the ulnar nerve and axillary artery; it passes downwards obliquely between two of the heads of the triceps, and aftgrwards to the outer side of the arm. In its course along the posterior part of the oS humeri, there are several branches detached from it to the triceps muscle, and one accompanies the spiral artery, and is spent upon the extensor mus- cles of the fore-arm. , There is also a subcutaneous branch sent off behind the os humeri, which pa*sses down to the back-part of the fore-arm, ,'and back-part of the hand, and jpins with the branches of the ulnar nerve. • The trunk of the nerve at the elbow-joint, is imbedded in the groove between the extensores carpi radiales, and brachialis internus ; and when so situated, detaches several small branches to the extensor and flexor muscles. Opposite to the head of the radius, the trunk of the nerve is subdivided into two great branches^ * Vid. Camper’s Views of the Nerves of ijie Arfy,

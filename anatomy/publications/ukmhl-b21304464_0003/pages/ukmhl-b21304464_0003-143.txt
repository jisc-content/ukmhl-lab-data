115 OF SENSATION. chemical substances: whereas electrical matter, if collected or accumulated, as in a Leyden jar, dis- charges itself at once. 1. We find that the electrical matter, whether excited by animal electricity, or collected, as in the common experiments with electrical matter, passes readily along the sciatic nerve of frogs ; the parts of which, after being cut transversely, are tied to- gether by a thread. 2. Upon placing a zinc plate under the loins of a frog, which had been separated from the upper part of the body, and with the sciatic nerves cXt posed, and touching it with a gold probe held in the right hand, as often as the left hand was ap- plied to the toes of the animal, its muscles are convulsed. 3. The parts of the frog being disposed as in the last experiment, and tied together as in the first experiment, upon touching the zinc with the side of a gold probe, held in the hand, and then applying the point of the probe to the sciatic nerve under the ligature, the muscles are instantly convulsed ; though the electrical matter had not passed into them, but had moved in the circle formed by the zinc, the gold probe, the loins, and the parts of the sciatic nerve above the point of the gold probe. 4. To prove that the electrical matter had not passed lower than the point of the gold probe, the parts of the frog being disposed as above, on touch- ing the sciatic nerve above the ligature with the H2

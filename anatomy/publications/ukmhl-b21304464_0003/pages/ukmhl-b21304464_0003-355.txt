OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE. 327 the former passes between the superior cava and ascending aorta, to the posterior part of the aorta, where the cardie nerves of the left side are added: thus, the plexus cardiacus magnus of Haller is formed. From this plexus, a branch is sent to the left coronary plexus, branches which creep along the right branch of the pulmonary artery to the heart, and a branch to the anterior coronary plexus. The lesser cardiac nerve^ passes along the ar- teria innominata and aorta, and ends in a plexus formed by the cardiac nerves on the left side of the aorta ascendens. I Of the Cardiac Nerves of the Left Side. The left cardiac nerves are superficial or deep- seated. The superficial passes behind the arch of the aorta, to the great cardiac plexus. The deeper-seated cardiac nerve, passes across the arch of the aorta; joins the cardiac nerves of the eighth pair, and forms the cardiac plexus ; and from this plexus, a nervous web extends on the left side of the ascending aorta, from which the right coronary plexus is derived, which passes between the pulmonary artery and aorta, and then along the coronary vessels.

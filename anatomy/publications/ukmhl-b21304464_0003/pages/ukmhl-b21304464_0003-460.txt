432 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. The bones of the foetus contain a much largeiT proportion of animal matter, than those of the adult, are of a grey colour, and the extremities of the long bones have a red tinge, from the number of bloodvessels proper to them. All the bones of the foetus are nearly uniform on their surfaces; whereas those of the adult, are very irregularly and deeply imprinted by the mus- cles. The bones of the foetus are filled by jelly in- stead of marrow. , The bones of the foetus are imperfect, and the greater number of them consists of several pieces; in each of which, there is a centre of ossification from wdiich fibres issue in different directions. The ossification does not go on with equal ra- pidity in all the bones. The ossification begins in the first place In the clavicles, ribs, vertebrae, and cylindrical bones, and then in the bones of the face and cranium. Each of the long bones consists of a middle shaft, an upper and under piece, which are not united to the middle piece until the period of puberty, and in each there is a centre of ossifica- tion. The ossification takes place in the flat bones from centres of ossification, and advances to the circumference of the bones. * Vid. Albinus, on the Bones of Children, and Nisbet* Osteology.

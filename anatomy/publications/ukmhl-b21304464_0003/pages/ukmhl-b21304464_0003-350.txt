OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 322 glands, and the inner membranes of the larger branches of th^ windpipe. The left bronchial arteries^ which are unequal in size, take their rise from the fore-part of the aorta; they are subdivided into many s-mall branches, which are distributed through the sub- stance of the lungs, along the coats of the pul- monary arteries and veins, and anastomose with the smaller ramifications of the pulmonary arte- ry. The Arteritk OESOpHACEiF take their rise from the aorta, or from the bronchial arteries ; they are subdivided into very minute branches, which are spent upon the coats of the gullet, and form an intricate plexus upon the innermost coat of that organ. There are also branches of these arteries distri- buted upon the posterior mediastinum and peri- cardium. The Superior Intercostal Artery is also a branch of the thoracic aorta. There are three large branches of this artery, which are lodged . within the grooves of the ribs; and the smaller branches of these arteries pass backwards to the spine, spinal marrow, and muscles of the back. The Inferior, or Aortic Intercostal Ar- teries, which are eight or ten pairs, take their rise from the back and lateral parts of the aorta, and are situated in the grooves in the under edges of the ribs between the intercostal muscles.

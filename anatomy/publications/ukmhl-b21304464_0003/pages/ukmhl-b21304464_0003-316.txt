'OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. S88 Sect. XI. OF THE SPINAL MARROW The spinal marrow is contained within the spine/ and, like the brain, is covered by the dura mater, the. arachnoid coat, and pia mater; and from its sides, nerves in pairs are derived, which pass un- der each of the true vertebrae, and under the five pieces of which the os sacrum originally con- sists. ' The arachnoid coat is closely connected with the pia mater by cellular substance ; and its outer part is connected with the dura mater between each pair of its nerves by sharp-pointed mem- branes, resembling the teeth of a saw, M'hich are said to form a ligamentum denticulatum. The spinal marrow is flattened before and be- hind with transverse folds on it, and is composed of two chords, each of which is subdivided, and consists, like the brain, of cineritious as well as of medullary matter, but the former is internal; and hence, upon dividing transversely the spinal mar- row, its internal cineritious substance has a cruci- form appearance.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY, 24<8 The species of this disease, are the Distinct and Confluent sinall-pox. Varicella, or Chicken-Pox, The vesicles in this disease, resemble very much those of the small-pox; the pustules, however, are filled by lymph, and they seldom suppurate ; crusts appear on the fourth br fifth day, and in general no scar or pit is left behind. The pustules are seldom, if ever confluent. Dr WiLLAN has described the Lenticular, the Conoidal, and the Swine or bleb-pox. Of Vaccina, or Cow-Pox. This disease appears on the teats of cows, in the form of small grey-coloured pustules, which are surrounded by an erysipelatous inflammation. The disease is communicated to persons employ- ed in milking the cows. Where the cuticle has been removed, small inflamed spots appear in a few days after exposure to the infection^ which quickly assume the appearance of blisters, and then become large vesicles of a circular form, and with a depres- sed centre. The lymphatic glands in the vicinity are af- fected, and there is an erysipelatous redness around the vesicles. These vesicles, when irritated, sometimes run into foul ulcers.

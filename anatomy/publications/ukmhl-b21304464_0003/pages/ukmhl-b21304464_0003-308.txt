280 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. ball, one or two small lymphatic glands have been observed at the side of the optic nerve. The lym- })hatics of the tongue pass into glands placed be- hind the angle of the jaw. The lymphatic vessels of the brain have been represented by Mascagni ; but they have not been seen by any other anatomist *. The superficial and deeper-seated lymphatic ves- sels of the head pass downwards to the glands M'hich are placed in the vicinity of the internal jugular and carotid arteries. These glands are large and numerous, and col- lected into clusters; and have been named the Glavdula; concatenafee colli. The lymphatic ves- sels 'from these are joined by several lymphatic vessels from the deeper parts of the thorax, and unite into a lymphatic trunk, which on the left side of the body^enters the thoracic duct near to its termination ; and on the right side, goes into a small short trunk, called the Duct of Steno. A few'of the lymphatic vessels sometimes open into the internal jugular vein, or into the subcla- vian veins, near to the junction of the internal ju- gular and subclavian veins f. * The lymphatic vessels of the brain and organs of the senses of the skull, were discovered by my Father, and are represented in his book on Fishes, I + Vid. Ol^servations on the Absorbent or Lymphatic Vessels pf the Encephalon of the Infundibulum and Glandula Pituitaiia, in my Fatherâ€™s book on the Nervous System, p. 17. j in his book on Fishes; and in his Treatise on the Brain.

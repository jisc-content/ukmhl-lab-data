OF THE ANTERIOR ILIAC ARTERY. 855' Z 2 the inguinal canal; a third to the spermatic chord, which communicates with the spermatic artery. There are many small branches of this artery, which are distributed upon the integuments of the abdomen, and which sink into the substance of the recti and other muscles of the abdomen ; and it also anastomoses with the thoracic, intercostal and lumbar arteries. Circumflex Artery of the Ilium.â€”This ar- tery arises opposite to the epigastric artery ; runs along the internal edge of the crural arch ; fol- lows a retrograde course, and reaches the spine of the os ilium ; and as it ascends, divides into branches, which supply the internal oblique and transverse muscles of the abdomen, and communi- cate with the lumbar and ilio-lumbar arteries, and with the inguinal branch of the arteria pro- funda femoris. This artery also gives branches to the psoas, sartorius and iliacus internus muscles. Of the Femoral Artery and its Branches. The femoral artery, surrounded by fat and the lym- phatic glands of the groin, lies over the ball of the thigh-bone, and covers the corresponding vein ; is afterwards lodged in the hollow at the upper and inner part of the thigh, having the adductor mus- cles on the inner side, and the rectus and sartorius on its outer side.

228 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. ■» the lens appears thicker than its circumference, the latter of which frequently assumes the appearance of a dark or black ring around the lens. The colour of the spot is various: it is either white or grey, and often the surface seems broken, like white clouds in summer, or there is an appear- ance of rays issuing as from a centre, when the dis- eased lens looks like a star. Sometimes the cataract is of a dark brown, or green hue, when the eye is examined with great attention. - The colour of the cataract is in some cases cha- racteristic of its consistence. . While a cataract is soft, and the lens is larger than common,' and seems to project beyond the pupil, the cataract is of the consistence of cream, and flows out when the capsule is punctured. This species is sometimes congenite. • There are two varieties of this*; one in which the capsule is thin and soft, the other, in vyhich the capsule is firm ; the latter has been called by Richter, cataracta cystica. Those of"a dark yellow, ash, or brown colour, are comnjonly firmer ; and in some rare cases, accord- ing to Wennel, are as hard as plaster of Paris. The harder the cataract, the smaller it general- ly is and sometimes the lens has been converted into bone. Some cataracts are partly hard and partly fluid ; sometimes fluid in the circumference, but solid in the centre, ana also mce versa.

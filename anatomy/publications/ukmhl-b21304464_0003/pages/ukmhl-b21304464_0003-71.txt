There is frequently a slight difference in the size of the testes of the opposite sides. The testes are placed obliquely, with one end upwards and forwards, and the other downwards and backwards j and are fixed to the body by means of the spermatic cord, which is attached to the superior part of the gland. ' The testes are somewhat of an oval form, flatten- ed at the sides. There is a thin and elongated body, called from its situation epididymis, which passes along the ou- ter and back part of the testis. The epididymis is somewhat larger at its upper and lower part, where it is fixed to the body of the testes; hence anatomists describe the globus major, or head of the epididymis, and globus minor, or lower part of it.

Muscles, which are subservient to very different purposes, viz. the flexor muscles, are supplied by the branches of the same nerves, which is intended to lessen the dan- ger which must otherwise have attended diseases or accidents. Thus,” (my Father has remarked,) “ let us suppose that two nerves are sufficient to supply the flexors and extensors of the fore-arm ; it is evi- dently better for us, that the one-half of each nerve goes to the flexors, and the other half to each of the extensors, than that the whole of the first nerve should have gone to the flexors, and the other half to the extensors. For if by acci- dent or disease, one of these nerves should be cut across, or lose its powers, we should on the first supposition, preserve one-half of the power both of flexion and extension, which would surely be preferable to our possessing fully the flexion, with- out any power of extension It may not be improper to add, that there is little or no reason to suppose, that the energy of one fibre of a nerve can directly affect that of a neighbouring or contiguous fibre, or that the ' • Vid.

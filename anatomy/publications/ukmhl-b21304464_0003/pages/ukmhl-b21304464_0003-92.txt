OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 64f 3d, As the number of th&se corpora lutea always corresponds with the number of fcEtuses. If a woman has had twins, there are two cor- pora lutea in one of the ovariu, or a corpus luteum in each ovarium. In quadrupeds, the number of corpora lutea, always corresponds with the number of young; 4th, As the uterine tubes, from their peculiar form, situation, and structure, are well calculated for giving passage * to the contents of the ova- rium.

The womb varies in size in virgins, and still more so in women who have had children ; and after impregnation, it never regains its original smallness. The womb, which in figure somewhat resembles a flattened pear, has been divided by anatomists into a fundus or uppermost part, a body, a neck, and mouth, or os tincse, which is placed trans- versely.

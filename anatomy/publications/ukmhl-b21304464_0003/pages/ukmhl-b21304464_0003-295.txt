OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. 267“ nus i and as it lies under the skin, it has been called the Superficial Temporal Artery. From it the following branches take their rise : a branch to the parotid gland ; a small branch to the masseter muscle, which anastomoses with the inferior labial artery •, and there is a branch which crosses the face in company with the duct of the parotid gland, and communicates with the facial and in- ternal maxillary arteries. The Deep Temporal is sent off behind the con- dyle of the jaw, and passes under the aponeurosis of the temporal muscle. Small branches of this artery, called the anterior auricular^ are distri- buted upon the fore-part of the* ear. The superficial temporal, after passing across the zygoma, divides into anterior and posterior branches. The anterior supplies the skin and muscles of the fore-part of the head, and anastomoses with the ocular and facial arteries. The branch divides info a number of branches, which supply the back-part of the head, and communicates repeatedly with the branches of the occipital artery. The last great branch sent off from the external carotid artery, has been called, on account of its si- tuation, the Internal Maxillary Artery, as it takes its rise from the external carotid artery, be- hind the upright plate of the under jaw, between the condyloid and coronoid processes of that ' bone.

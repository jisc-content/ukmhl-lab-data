There are also a few lymphatic vessels which accompany the cephalic vem, and passing be- ■ tween the‘pectoral and deltoid muscles, are con- nected with some lymphatic glands; which are found at the under-part of the clavicle.' • The deeper-seated lymphatic vessels, which ac- company the branches of the arteries, accompany the radial, ulnar, and humeral arteries, and at length join the axillary lymphatic glands. The greater number of the lymphatic vessels of the mammae and lateral part's of the chest, join with the axillary glands; and there are various branches wlijch pass over the clavicles,*and ter-, minate in lymphatic glands at the ,bottom of the neck. From the axillary glands, large lymphatic ves- sels pass beneath the subclavian muscle, and by their union form a trunk, which, on the left side of the bofly, leads. to the thoracic duct near to its termination in the angle formed by the internal- jugular and subclavian veins. On the right side of the body, the trunk form- ed by the lymphatic vessels of the superior extre- mity, joins w’ith*the large lymphatic trunk, called the Trunk of Steno,

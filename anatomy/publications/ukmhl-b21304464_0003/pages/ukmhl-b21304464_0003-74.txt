OUTLINES OF ANATOMY^ 46 The glandular part of the testicle is partially divided into lobes or parts, by a number of pro- cesses from the tunica albuginea testis, called the septula testis. 0/ the Seminiferous Tubes of the Testicle. Upon steeping the testicle for some time in wa- ter, It may be resolved into a great number of small convoluted threads or tubes, which, accord- ing to my Father, do not exceed the part of an inch in diameter ; and when filled with mer- cury, the yt-3^ part of an inch. These seminife- rous tubes may be filled by mercury, their coats being of considerable strength ; and upon these, the smaller ramifications of the spermatic arteries are distributed. The convoluted seminiferous tubes are cylinders, and do not join into trunks like the ducts of other glands, but pass into the rete testis at the back of the testis, where the epididymis is joined to it. My Father has calculated, that the testis consists of 62.500 tubes, supposing each to be one inch long ; and that if the tubes were united, they would be 5208 feet and 4 inches long*. * â€œ Utveropleniorem ctclarioremductuumtestis seminiferorum conspcctum exhibcamusj eorum diametrum, numerum, uniuscu- jusque dein longitudinem, et hinc flexuum numerum quern ab origine ad rctc testis usque perficiunt, ad calculum revocare liceat.

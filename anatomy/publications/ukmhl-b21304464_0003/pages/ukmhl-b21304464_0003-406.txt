378 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. tained where it might have been obstructed by the sudden and unequal pressure, to which par- ticular organs are exposed, occasioned by dis- tention, contortion, or the pressure of neigh- bouring organs, as in the case of the stomach, in- testines, bladder of urine, and womb. The blood, by means of the anastomoses, may occasionally pursue even a retrogade course. The extremities of the body, from various causes, are liable to partial pressure ; hence there are numerous anastomoses at the shoulder, elbow, hip, and knee joints, so that modern surgeons do not now hesitate to throw ligatures upon the sub- clavian, axillary, humeral, iliac, femoral, or pop- liteal arteries, being fully aware, that the circu- lation of the blood will be maintained by means of the lateral anastomosing arteries. 2d, It IS highly probable, that the still smaller ramifications of the arteries, are in a similar man- ner subservient to the larger anastomosing arteries, as in the case of the extremities; and I have no doubt, that the anastomoses upon the periosteum of the thigh-bone, so beautifully represented by Scarpa in his Treatise upon Aneurism, have a considerable share in supporting the circulation, when the main trunk of the artery of the thigh has been obstructed. 3d, The anastomoses of the arteries may per- haps serve other useful purposes in the animal e- conomy, as they are not merely proper to those or- gans which are exposed to the influence of pressure.

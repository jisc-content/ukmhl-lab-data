OUTLINES OF ANATOMY, 47» the anterior side of the canal, yet I have never had occasion to notice any case in which this deficien- cy existed, and was not complicated with conge- nital hernia. “ In one of the subjects with congenital hernia, the sac did not escape from the canal; in five, it had, from the peculiar state of the canal, descend- ed along the thigh, assuming to a great degree the resemblance of crural hernia ; and in one, it was bound down.by the superficial aponeurosis of the external oblique. In this person, the oblique apo- neurosis had come in reality to supply the place of the anterior side of the canal; it was so strong, that it resisted the passage of the tumour down along the thigh ; it led it down to the upper part of the labium pudendi. “ This was not the only peculiarity of the case ; for the tumour, in its course to the labium, insi- nuated itself between the fillets of the upper pil- lar of the canal, and at that point was strictured by this fillet. There was also a very obvious narrowing at the part where the sac escaped from the deficient canal. The stricture was formed by the interlacing fibres of the external oblique *, a fact which proves, that the deficiency of the canal docs not depend on the want of these fibres. “ In congenital inguinal hernia, the risk is, that we mistake the disease for crural hernia. It has been seen, that the tumour in the former, ovving to the imperfect state of the anterior wall of the canal, , comes, in the majority of cases, by separating the

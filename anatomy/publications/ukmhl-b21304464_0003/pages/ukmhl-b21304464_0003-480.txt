The gravid womb contains a quantity of a wa- tery fluid, named the liquor amnii^ by which the womb is prevented from pressing unequally upon the body of the child, which expands more equal- ly in all its dimensions. This watery fluid also renders the pressure of the foetus on the body of the mother more equal.. The foetus is expelled from the womb by the combined actions of the abdominal muscles and womb; which latter Dr William Harvey in- forms us he had seen in a quadruped, and which he has described as a motus undosus. j

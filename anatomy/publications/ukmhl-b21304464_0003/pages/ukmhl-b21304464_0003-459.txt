POSITION OF THE FOETUS IN UTERO. 431 fans in utero ut plurimum rej^eritur, adductis ad abdomen genibus, flexis restrorsum cruribus, pe- dibus decussatis, manibusqiie sursum ad caput sublatis, quarum alteram circa tempora vel auriculas, alteram ad genam detinet; ubi ma- culae albae, tanquam confricationis vestigia, in cute cernuntur : spina in orbem flectitur, caput ad genua, incurvato collo, propendet. Tali membro- rum situ, qualem in somno per quietem quaerimus^ capite superne, facieque ut plurimum ad matws' spinam versa, embryo locator*.” ' Sect. II. OF THE PECULIARITIES AS TO STRUCTURE OF THE FOETUS. The skin of the foetus is besmeared by a white greasy substance, which is insoluble in alcohol, oil, or pure water, and forms a soap with alkalies. The skin is redder than that of the adult; and though there be a good deal of fat under the skin, there is very little fat between the muscles, or within the cavity of the abdomen. The most striking peculiarities of the foetus, are, the im. erfect state of its bones, the large size of all its glands, and of the nervous and vascular sys- tems. * Vid. G.

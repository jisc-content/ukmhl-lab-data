17 OF THE URINE. Sect. V* OF THE URINE. Healthy urine is a transparent fluid, of a light amber colour, which emits a peculiar odour, has a slightly bitter taste, and the specific gravity of it varies, according to Cruickshanks, from 1.005 to 1.033. The odour of urine that has been kept for two or three days, is distinctly alkaline. The state of the urine depends much upon the state of the other secretions, particularly upon the quantity of sweat and perspiration; hence the quantity of the urine is various at different seasons of the year. The state of the urine is modified by the age of the individual. The urine of a child, whose bones are not com- pletely ossified, contains no phosphoric acid, but a large excess of benzoic acid. The urine of the old, is highly charged with the earthy phosphates, with the uric acid, and mucilage. Different kinds of food bring about a change in the urine, particularly when the di- gestive organs are weak. Various vegetable substances, taken into the sto- ijiach, communicate their flavour and colour to the urine : rhubarb makes urine of a deep yellow co- lour ; madder renders it red j and indigo commu- nicates a blue tinge.

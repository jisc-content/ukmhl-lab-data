347 VEINS or ORGANS OF URINE, &C. and from them the lymphatic vessels pass upwards to a cluster of glands, situated over the aorta, where it divides into its great branches, and which have been called lumbar lymphatic glands. Sect. IV. 9F THE VEINS WHICH CORRESPOND WITH THE AR- TERIES OF THE ORGANS OF URINE AND GENERA- TION. The Renal Veins terminate in the vena cava inferior ; the left is longer than the right, as the aorta intervenes between the left kidney and the vena cava. The veins which correspond with the arteri^ capsulares, terminate in the renal vein, and some- times in the vena cava. The Spermatic Veins are larger than the sper- matic artery, and form a plexus which accom- panies the spermatic artery ; and opposite to the lower end of the kidney, this plexus terminates in a single trunk, which ends in the vena cava, a .little below the renal v^in. The termination of the spermatic vein of the female, is similar to that of the male. There are veins which correspond with the ar- teries of the bladder of urine, which lead into the hypogastric veins. 1 he veins of the penis form a large vein, which runs along the penis, called the ve?2a ipsius penis;

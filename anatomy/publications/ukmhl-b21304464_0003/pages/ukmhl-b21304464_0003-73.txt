By means of this muscle, the testicles are drawn upwards during coition, and also somewhat com- pressed. There are two coats proper to the testicle ; the external, called tunica vaginalis, is a prolongation of the peritoneum, which forms a shut sac, and co- vers the testicle, as the pericardium covers the heart, but not in quadrupeds-j*, and is reflected over the testis, covering the epididymis, and part of the spermatic vessels, to which it closely ad- heres f. Within the vaginal coat, there is a much whiter coat; hence named tunica albuginea, which very closely adheres to the body of the testicle, and which is perforated at its posterior part by the se- minal tubes and blood-vessels of the testes. This coat is thick, and, in the healthy state, possesses but a small share of elasticity. Upon cutting through the tunica albuginea, the brown-coloured glandular part of the testes which is of a pulpy consistence, presents itself.

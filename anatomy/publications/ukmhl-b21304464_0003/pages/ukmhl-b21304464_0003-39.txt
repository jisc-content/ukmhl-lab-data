COATS OF THE BLADDER. u Of the Coats of the Bladder of Urine. Four coats are commonly said to be proper to the bladder, viz. a membranous coat, which is de- rived from the peritoneum, a muscular coat, a cellular coat, and an internal mucous coat. The peritoneum covers only the upper and back part of the bladder of the adult. The external surface of this coat is besmeared by a quantity of a serous fluid. Its internal surface adheres to the muscular coat, by means of very loose cellular membranes. This cellular membrane has not the same thick- ness, or even appearance, in every part of the blad- der. In the anterior and lateral regions, the cel- lular substance is lax, and there is a considerable quantity of fat intermixed with it. Around the vesiculae seminales, we find a dense cellular substance of a whiter colour. â€˜ The cellular substance has been stated to add considerably to the strength of the bladder; for when it is dissected off, the internal coat is pro- truded betwixt the muscular fibres. The muscular fibres of the bladder, in the heal- thy state, are of a pale colour, and but of a small size, and disposed in fasciculi, which cross each other in every possible direction, and completely surround the bladder. Some of these muscular fasciculi follow a longi-

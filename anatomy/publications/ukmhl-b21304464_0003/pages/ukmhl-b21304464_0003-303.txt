OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. 275 I The blood from the eye-ball returns to the heart partly by the medium of the facial vein, which communicates with the veins at the inner corner of the eye, and partly by the ocular veins. The principal ocular vein is formed by the cen- tral vein of the retina; by the ciliary, lacrymal, and ethmoidal veins, which correspond with the arteries distributed on the muscles of the eyes. The veins which correspond with the ciliary arteries describe nearly semicircles; meet in a centre, and form a trunk, which perforates the sclerotic coat, and the several trunks of the veins formed in the above manner open into the ocular vein. The ocular veins which anastomose with the facial veins at the inner angles of the orbits, lead into the circular sinuses of Ridley, placed around the glandula pituiraria, from which the blood flow's into the cavernous sinuses; and by the me- dium of the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses, the former of W'hich, is situated upon the ridges, and the latter, at the basis of the partes petrosae, reaches the extremities of the lateral sinuses and internal jugular veins. The anterior superior, and anterior inferior oc- cipital sinuses, placed upon the cuneiform process of the occipital bone, communicate wdth the in- ferior petrosal and lateral sinuses, and wdth the vertebral veins, S 2

OF THE EXTERNAL-CAROTID ARTERY. 265 * cks j and a' branchy called ranine, which passes under the middle of the tongue, to its point. The pharyngeal artery arises a little above the lingual; and, dividing into small branches, supplies the pharynx and fauces with blood; and it en- ters the skull at the foramen jugulare, and gives branches to the dura mater, the external membrane of the brain. The next branch, which is smaller than the preceding, is called the ascending palatine; it is covered by the styloid muscle, and is distributed upon the side of the pharynx, upon the ton- , sils, tongue, and inferior maxillary gland. Small branches are also sent to the stylo-hyoid, stylo- pharyngeus, and hyoglossus muscles. The continuation of the carotid artery rises up upon the angle of the lower jaw, at the fore-part of the masseter muscle ; and hence has been call- ed the angular, facial, or external maxillary ar~ tery. ^ This artery sends off various small branches, which are distributed updifthe muscles of the face : it ascends to the internal canthusof the eye, where it anastomoses repeatedly with the branches of the ocular and frontal arteries. A large branch of this artery has been called the hferior labial. It supplies the parts of the under-lip, and anastomoses with the correspond- ing artery of the opposite side ; and there are se- veral small branches of it, which supply the buccinator muscle.

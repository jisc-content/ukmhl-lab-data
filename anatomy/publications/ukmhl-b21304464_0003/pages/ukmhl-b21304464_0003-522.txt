6UTLINES OF ANATOMV* 491 Stowed on accuracy and minuteness of description, it is my anxious wish to keep the mind of the stu- dent continually awake to their relative position and intimate connection. On this principle, I have not neglected to note, even in the Outlines, that the form and movements of the ribs have a reference to the lungs, and the function of respiration ; that the structure of the pelvis or basin, has a reference to the functions of the bladder of urine, and of the womb *, and that the structure of the skull contributes to the acute- tiess of the organs of sense. Room has also been made for remarks of the following character,â€”that an exact knowledge of the relative situation of the bones, muscles, arte- ries, veins, and nerves, is indispensably necessary to every operation which the surgeon can be called upon to perform, and ought to have a due influence on all the steps which he may be induced to take in preparing for the relief of accident or disease. These are hints of equal importance for direct- ing the prosecution of study, and the details of successful practice. The exposition contained in these Volumes of the Winter Course of Anatomy, taught in the Uni- versity of Edinburgh, may perhaps serve to con- vince the public of a fact, well known to my pu- pils, that the Morbid Anatomy is not detached from , the healthy, and converted into the business of a Summer Session.

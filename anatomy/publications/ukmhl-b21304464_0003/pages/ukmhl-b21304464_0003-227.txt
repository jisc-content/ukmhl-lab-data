N 4 OF THE CORPUS MUCOSUM. 399 The nails are fixed at their roots by a semilunar fold of the skin, and are covered by a reflection of the cuticle. The nails grow from the roots. The nails assist us in picking up very small bodies, and are also well calculated for defend- ing the extremities of the fingers and toes. Of the Corpus Mucosum, or Rete Mucosum. The corpus mucosum, which is situated under the cuticle, gives colour to the skin. The corpus mucosum covers every part of the true skin, excepting under the nails, and connects it to the cuticle. The colour of this substance is seen through the semitransparent cuticle. The corpus mucosum is a viscid substance, which envelops a great many small bloodvessels and nerves, which pass to the cuticle. The corpus mucosum is not of an uniform thick- ness ; hence the palms of the hands and soles of the Negro, are not of so dark a colour as the rest of his body ; and even in individuals of the same nation, it is darker in some parts of the body than in others, as in the arm-pits and eye- lids. It differs not only in colour, but in thickness, in different nations; being not only of a darker colour, but much thicker and stronger in the Negro than the European ; and, in the former, may be divid- ed into layers.

449 NUTRITION OF THE FOETUS. municated with each other by anastomoses, and thus that the child was nourished; but this opi- nion does not rest upon the solid foundation of in- duction from fact, because it has been fully ascer- tained that there is no immediate communication between the foetal and maternal portions of the placenta. 2. The nourishment of the foetus has been sup- posed to be absorbed by the veins of the placenta, from the blood effused from the placenta into its cells by the uterine arteries. 3. ScHREGER has ptoposed a modification of the last-mentioned hypothesis. He supposes-that by the uterine arteries seruln is secreted, and discharged into the cells of the placenta, which is absorbed by the lymphatic ves- sels of the placenta and umbilical cord. This ingenious theory rests upon an alleged ex- istence of lymphatic vessels in the placenta and umbilical cord ; of the existence of which there can be no doubt, as several authors of credit, Mec- kel, Waltherus, Ludwig, Mascagni, Wris- BERG and Reuss, have described them, 4. The foetus has by some authors been supposed to swallow the liquor amnii, and to derive its nou- rishment from it. But as full grown and healthy foetuses have been born, and with the mouth closed, it follows, that the liquor amnii had not been sw'allowed; and besides, the liquor amnii is secreted by the ves- VOL.

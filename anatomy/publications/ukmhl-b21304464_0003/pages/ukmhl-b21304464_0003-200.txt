OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 172 Of the Caruncula Lacrymalk. The caruncula lacrymalis, is a small conglome- rate gland, of a red colour, which was supposed to secrete a share of the tears; it is situated be- tween the inner angle of the eye-lids, and se- cretes a sebaceous matter. From the caruncula, one or two hairs grow. There is a small vascular fold of the tunica ad- nata, named palpehra tertia^ which is placed be- tween the caruncula lacrymalis and the ball of the eye. Of the Chemical Analysis of the Tears. The tears, which are transparent and colourless, with scarcely any smell, but a saline taste, are composed of the following ingredients: W ater. Mucus. Muriate of soda. Soda. Phosphate of lime. Phosphate of soda. The saline parts amount only to about 0.01 of the w^hole. The specific gravity of the fluid, is somewhat greater than that of distilled water *. ♦ Thomson’s Chemistry, vol. v. p. 595;

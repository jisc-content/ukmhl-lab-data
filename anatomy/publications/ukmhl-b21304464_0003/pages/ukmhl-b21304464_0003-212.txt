OUTLINES OF ANATOMY* Of the Labyrinth or Vestible. \ The Labyrinth, placed at the inner part of the tympanum, is of an irregular form ; much smaller than the tympanum, and contains a sac which is filled by a gelatinous fluid. A part of the gelatinous fluid of the labyrinth is supposed by Cotunnius to be absorbed by two small conical-shapcd canals ; one of which he has described as taking its rise at the under-part of the scala tympani, and as terminating on the surface of the dura mater ; the other canal, he observes, descends from the vestible, and termi- nates between the layers of the dura mater. The arteries of the vestible arc derived from the vertebral arteries, which pass through the fora- mina at the bottom of the meatus auditorius inter- nus. There are several parts which communicate with the labyrinth. The three semicircular canals communicate with the vestible by five apertures ; for two of the ca- nals have a common termination. The cochlea also communicates with the vestible, and, in the skeleton, the tympanum. The canals, called improperly semicircular^ as they describe a greater portion of a circle, are three

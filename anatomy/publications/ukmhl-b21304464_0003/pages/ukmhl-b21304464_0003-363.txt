SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY. S55 Branches to the omentum; branches to the sto- mach, which anastomose with the superior gas- tric and pyloric arteries. The Right Branch of the Hepatic Artery, before dipping into the substance of the liver, sends off branches to the gall-bladder, called the Cystic, which pass along the left side of the gall- bladder, and which are subdivided into a number of very minute branches upon the villous coat of the gall-bladder. Of the Superior Mesenteric Artery. The Superior Mesenteric Artery, which 'is equal in some to the coeliac artery, takes its rise from the aorta, about a quarter of an inch below the coeliac : it is concealed by the pancreas. This artery passes over the duodenum, and is situated between the layers of the mesentery ; it turns from the left side of the spine, towards the right, forming an arch. From the left or convex side of the arch, twenty or thirty large branches are sent; each of which divides into two branches, which communicate with each other, and form arches ; from the convex part of which still smaller arteries are derived, which anasto- mose in a similar manner. There is a similar junction and separation of the smaller branches : at length the branches are straight, which pass to the intestines, and which

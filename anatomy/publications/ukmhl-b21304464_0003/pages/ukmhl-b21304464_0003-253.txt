DERANGEMENTS OF THE CORNEA. 225 Wounds inflicted on the cornea often occasion ulceration of it. The cornea has been in some cases much ex- tended ; in some such cases it becomes harder, but in others softer than usual ; it assumes a conical shape ; projects considerably beyond the eye-lids, is opaque, of a pearly colour, and often adheres to the iris. This disease is called tsta()hyloma. In a few cases, the disease continues stationary ; but in others the diseased cornea, probably in con- sequence of the stimulus of the air, and the fric- tion of the eye-lids, to which it is continually ex- posed, becomes gradually more and more promi- nent, and in general more or less inflamed. Scarpa, in his late Treatise upon the Diseases of the Eyes, has described what he has called the staphyloma of the sclerotic coat. In -this disease, the posterior.part of the sclerotic coat, at the side of the optic nerve, was elevated into an ob- long tumour, which somewhat resembled a small nut. The cornea, is sometimes, though rarely, par- tially ossified : the bony scales are generally very thin, and lodged between the layers of the cor- nea. Hairs sometimes grow from the cornea. VOI..

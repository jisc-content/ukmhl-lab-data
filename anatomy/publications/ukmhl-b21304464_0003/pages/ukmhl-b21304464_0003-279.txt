The tumour is to the touch, elastic *, it gradually enlarges, acquires a dark purple colour, and bleeds frequently ; and I have observed, that, in some iijstanccs,L it feels colder than the surrounding skin. CHAPTER V. OF THE ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE CELLULAR SUBSTANCE. ATER and pus are frequently collected in the cellular substance, and sometimes air. The most frequent organic derangement of the cellular substance is phlegmon, a tumour of a vivid red colour, with a circumscribed base, which rises into a point, and which frequently terminates in abscess.

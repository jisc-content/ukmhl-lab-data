O.UTLINES OF-ANATOMY. ' The Carotid Artery generally divides, nearly opposite to the upper margin of the thyroid card-â€¢ lagc of the larynx, into two great branches, called the external and internal carotids. The External Carotid passes behind the stylo-hyoid and digas- tric muscles, behind the angle of the lower jaw ; and during the above course, the following consi- derable branches are derived from it. The first branchy called superior thyroid^ comes off at the place of division of the common ca- rotid, descends, and suddenly divides into branches, which are distributed upon the sterno-mastoid and platysma myoides muscles, and upon the muscles which are fixed to the os hyqides, larynx, and the membrane of the larynx. The trunk of the artery always communicates with the corresponding artery of the opposite side, and also with the inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the subclavian artery. A number of small branches of this Arte- ry are distributed on the lobes of the thyroid gland. The next considerable branch is the lingual, which passes over the corner of the os hyoides, and then under the hyoglossus and genio-glossus muscles to the tongue. There are several small branches sent off from this artery, viz. a branch to the constrictor medius of the pharynx ; a branch to the hyoglossus and mylo-hyoideus mus-

CIRCULATION IN THE FOETUS. 443 â€¢of the child. This vein enters at the navel of the child; ascends in a fold of the peritoneum be- hind the recti muscles, to the anterior extremity of the fossa umbilicalis of the liver-; it passes along half that fissure ; gives branches to both lobes of the liver, and terminates in the left branch of the vena portarum, from which a part of its contents flows into the vena cava inferior by the canalis venosus. The blood of the vena cava inferior, which di- vides into two branches, flows into both auri- cles. The greater share of it passes into the left auricle, through the foramen ovale by the me- dium of the larger branch of the inferior vena cava. From the left auricle, the blood flows into the left ventricle ; and by the muscular contraction of that organ, it is propelled into the aorta and its several branches. It has been already observed, that, on account of the peculiar state of the lungs of the foetus, there were two direct passages, by which the blood is diverted from the lungs. If there had existed only one passage, the auricles and ventricle's of the right and left sides of the heart must have transmitted unequal quantities of blood. If the foramen ovale had been awanting, the right side of the heart must have received the whole of the blood, and the left side of the heart only that smaller proportion of the blood which had passed

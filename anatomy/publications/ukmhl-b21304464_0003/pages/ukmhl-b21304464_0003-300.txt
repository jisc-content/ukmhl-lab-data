The Arteri^ Medije Cerebri, or arteriae mediae fossae Sylvii, are. larger than the arteriae anteriores. These arteries are lodged in the fossae Sylvii, extend obliquely outwards, and their innu- merable branches supply the middle and posterior lobes of the brain, and anastomose with the branches of the anterior arteries, and also with those of the vertebral arteries. A few of the smaller branches of these arteries perforate the substance of the brain, supply the anterior cornua of the lateral ventricles, and also concur in forming the choroid plexuses. .The brain also receives blood by the medium of the vertebral arteries, branches of the subclavian artery. The vertebral arteries^ after having entered the head, detach large branches, which joins- with similar branches of the anterior artery of the brain, and form an arterial circle aroimd the sella turcica, which has been named the Arterial Circle of Willis.

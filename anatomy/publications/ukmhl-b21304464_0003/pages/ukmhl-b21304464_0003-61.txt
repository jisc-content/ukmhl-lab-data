DISEASES OF THE BLADDER, 33 The bladder has sometimes been enormously distended. I have seen a case, in which the bladder contained 10 lbs. of urine. The bladder is, on the other hand, occasionally very much contracted. This sometimes happens from the inordinate contraction of the muscles of the bladder, as in persons who have been killed by hanging, but more frequently it is the effect of dis- ease, and owing to the great thickness of the coats of the bladder, especially of the muscular coats, w'hich become not only thicker, but also redder than in the healthy state. The bladder has on some occasions been con- tracted in its middle, so as to resemble an hour- glass, in consequence of the irritation of a calculus of the bladder. The bladder has sometimes been divided into i three distinct compartments. Cysts, which communicate by a narrow neck with the general cavity of the bladder, have some- times been observed, and such cysts are generally of different sizes, and filled by calculi. . The coats of the bladder have sometimes been ruptured in consequence of ulceration. Rupture of the bladder also sometimes takes place from inordinate distention. Gangrene of the bladder has been described. The rectum sometimes communicates with the bladder of urine, and air is discharged with the urine. Worms have also been discharged along with the urine VOL. in. C

OF THE LUMBAR NERVES. 373 Branches of the second, third and fourth lum- bar nerves form a nerve, which has been named Obturator, as it passes through the aperture in the ligamentous membrane, which shuts up the foramen obturatorium. This nerve supplies the obturator internus and pectineus muscles, and then divides into two parts, which are distributed upon the adductor muscles of the thigh. The third and fourth Lumbar pairs of nerves are considerably larger than the preceding, arid from them the following nerves are derived. The crural nerve, which detaches branches to the iliacus internus and psoas ; and passing be- hind the crural arch, is distributed upon the mus- cles and skin of the upper and lateral parts of the thigh, and is subdivided into subcutaneous hrancheSy which are spent upon the middle, fore and inner part of the thigh, and into deeper-seated and lar- ger branches, which supply the pectineus muscles, the sartorius, triceps, adductor femoris, and the four large extensor muscles of the leg. A branch of the subcutaneous branch accom- panies the vena saphaena, and has been called by Fischer the Nervus Saphcefius. This nerve supplies the inner and fore part of the leg, and is continued to the upper and inner part of the foot. This nerve descends between the sartorius and triceps muscles, and reaches the inner side of the tibia ; and under the knee, it detaches a branch, called the Nervus Saphcenus minory which is sub- A a 3

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 516 one «f which, is deep-seated, the other more supv'^ JicioL The superficial branch descends along with the radial artery, and below the middle of the radius, is subdivided into tlie X'olar and dorsal branches. The former is distributed upon the annular ligament and muscles of the thumb ; the latter divides into a number of small branches, which are distributed upon the muscles in the vicinity of the metacarpal bones and fore-finger; and there‘are also branches oi this nerve which are proper to the fore and middle fingers, and to the side of the ring-finger next to the middle-finger. The deep-seated Ijo'anch supplies the extensores carpi radiales, perforates the supinator radii, and reaches the back-part of the fore-arm, and, descend- ing along the extensor primi internodii pollicis, arrives at the badk-part of the hand, and annular ligament of the wrist, and at length terminates on the back-part of the metacarpus, 8th, The Musculo-Cutaneus, or Perforans Casserii. The trunk of this nerve perforates the, upper-part of the coraco-brachialis muscle, and afterwards passing between the scapulo-radialis, and brachialis internus muscles, to both of which, it gives many small branches; gets to the outer side of the tendon of the scapulo-radialis muscle, and passes behind the median cephalic vein ; af- terwards it passes down the arm under the skin, and over the supinator Tadii longus, as far as the

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 526 formed by the small branches passing from the recurrent nerves of opposite sides, and by the branches of the sympathetic nerves, which go to the heart. This plexus covers the larger bran- ches of the pulmonary artery; and there are some small branches of nerves which creep along the smaller ramifications of the pulmonary ar- tery. This plexus, has been called the anterior pul- monary plexus of nerxies^ in contradistinction to the posterior pulmonary plexus^ formed by the eighth pair, and which are situated behind the root of the lungs. The pulmonary plexuses being detached, the eighth pair divides into chords, which surround the oesophagus, and which form what anatomists have described as the oesophagean plexuses. Of the Sympathetic Nerve. The branches from the sym.pathetic nerve, creep along the surface of the arteries and veins con- nected with the heart. Of the Cardiac Nerves of the Right Side. On the right side, there are two principal nerves, the great and smaller cardiac nerves. The trunk of

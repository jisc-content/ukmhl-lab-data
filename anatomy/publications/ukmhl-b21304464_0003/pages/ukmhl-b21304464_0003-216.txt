188 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. and superior fossula. The nerves which go to the vestible and semicircular canals, pass through the inferior fossula; and those which go to the vestible, through the superior. My Father has also described in the following words, with great care, the minuter ramifications of the branches of the portio mollis, distributed upon the semicircular canals, cochlea, and vea* tible : “ I found, that the portio mollis is composed of two branches nearly equal in size ; one of which supplies the vestible and semicircular ca- nals, and the other the cochlea: “ That each branch consists of a great number of small chords: That the small chords of both branches pass through different minute holes into the vestible and cochlea, or, that the bottom of the canal in the back-part of the os petrosum, commonly call- ed meatus audltorius internus, is cribriform. “ As the osseous partitions which divide the cochlea into its gyri, as well as the lamina spiralis, which divides the gyri into scalae, are connected to the circumference of the modiolus ; we might expect to find the branches of the portio mollis conducted, from the modiolus, to the membranes lining the cochlea, by means of these partitions, or between or along the outer sides of the two osseous plates which compose them, as well as between the two lamellse which compose the lamina spi- ralis, or along the outer sides of these; as we

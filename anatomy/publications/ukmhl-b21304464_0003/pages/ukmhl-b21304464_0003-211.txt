M 4 OF THE STAPEDIUS. J83 by which the membrane of the drum is made more .concave and tense. Stapedius. This muscle arises by a small fleshy belly, from a little cavern in the pars petrosa, near the cells of the mastoid process, before the inferior part of the passage for the portio dura *, its tendon passes through a small round hole in the side ol the same cavern â€¢, enters the interior part of the tympanum, and is inserted into the posterior part of the head of the stapes. By this muscle, the stapes is drawn obliquely upwards, by which the posterior part of its base is moved inwards, and the anterior part out- wards. The air within the tympanum increases the . force of the sound; to which the tension of the membrane of the drum and of the chain of small bones essentially contributes ; and the vi- brations of sound are thus communicated from the membrane of the drum to the membranes of the round and oval apertures, and the tension of the chain of bones is probably adapted to the kind of sound. The parts which communicate with the tympanum increase the intensity of the sound.

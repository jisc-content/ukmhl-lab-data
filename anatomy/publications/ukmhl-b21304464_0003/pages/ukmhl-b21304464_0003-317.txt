289 OF THE SPINAL MARROW. Every nerve derived from the spinal marrow consists of an Anterior and Posterior bundle of nervous fibres^ each of which has its proper hole in the spinal marrow ; on the outer side of which they are involved in a common sheath ; and when this has been dissected with care, a ganglion is discovered in the posterior bundle. The spinal marrow terminates in a conical point, about the lower part of the second lumbar verte- bra. The nerves connected with the spinal marrow become longer as we follow them within the dura mater, from the head downwards to the lower end of the spinal marrow. The nervous filaments, un- der the termination of the spinal marrow as a sin- gle chord, or lower than the second lumbar vete- bra, on account of their length, are disposed in a parallel manner in respect to each other, and some- what like the. hairs in a horseâ€™s tail; hence that portion of the spinal marrow has been called cau- da equina. The posterior branches of the spinal marrow in the neck, are connected to each other by smal- ler nerves. On the outside of the dura mater, the spinal nerves are connected on their fore-part to a nerve called the great sympathetic net've, and joined to each other by large arches, from which the mus'- cles of the head, trunk and extremities, 'are suc- cessively supplied.

392 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. the abdomen, about thirteen weeks after the iliac artery had been tied ; and as the limb had been well injected, the anastomoses of the internal iliac with the femoral artery, and arteria profunda, were well displayed. The anastomosis between the internal iliac, and femoral artery, was by means of the internal and external pudic arteries along the penis, which ar- teries fully joined, and were considerably enlar- ged. The anastomosis with the profunda, was by the ischiatic artery on the gluteus maximus, and by a still larger branch, which passed from the ischiatic to the profunda on the sciatic nerve. The gluteal artery also freely anastomosed with the external circumflex artery, over the outer part of the ilium. The obturator artery, formed free anastomoses with the internal circumflex. The epigastric artery had its natural supply of blood cut olF by the ligature on the external iliac artery; the epigastric gave off the obturator, which joined freely with the lateral sacral artery of the internal iliac, and then the epigastric re- ceived its blood from the internal iliac, by the media of the lateral sacral and obturator arteries. . Before concluding, it may not be improper to add, that the slow and gradual expansion of the lateral anastomosing arteries, affords a satisfactory explanation of the coldness of the limb, which sometimes succeeds the operation for aneurism ;

360 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. the superior branch of the profunda ascended up- on the posterior part of the long head of the bi- ceps flexor cruris, and divided into two small branches which inosculate with two similar branches of the ischiatic artery, so that, upon the above mentioned muscle, arterial circle is form- ed by the conjoined branches of the ischiatic and superior perforating branch of the profunda fe- moris. In this preparation, there was another arterial circle formed upon the dorsum of the os ilium, immediately above the acetabulum, by the con- joined branches of the external circumflex artery,â€™ and a small gluteal artery. I have made the more particular mention of these arterial circles, or as they may be called double anastomoses, found in the above described, case, as Scarpa has not represented such arterial circles in his very splendid and accurate Plates of the arteries of the head, neck, superior and in- ferior extremities. In most cases, the perforating branches come off separately, as mentioned below ; but, in other instances, I have seen them derived from a com- mon trunk. The second perforating branch, passes through the adductor maximus muscle, and divides into a number of small branches, which are distributed upon the biceps flexor cruris. The third perforating artery, passes over the short head of the biceps flexor cruris, and after-

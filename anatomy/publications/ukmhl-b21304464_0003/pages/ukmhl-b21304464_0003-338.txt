310 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. which supplies the parts around the angle of the jaw ; and a branch, which supplies the back-part of the ear, called posterior auricular, and which subdivides into branches, which are distributed on the back-prart of the ear and temple; the platys- ma muscle ; the parotid gland, and which commu- nicate with the portio dura of the seventh pair. The continuation of the second cervical nerve is spent upon the extensor muscles of the head ancl neck, and the letator scapulae. The Third Cervical Nerve joins with the middle ganglion of the sympathetic nerve, with the trunk of the fourth cervical nerve, and assists in forming the phrenic nerve. A branch of this nerve joins with the middl^ ganglion of the sympathetic* nerve. . This nerve afterwards divides into external and internal branches; the former supplies the upper part of the scapula, the latter supplies the mus- cles and skin at tbe upper part of the neck and shoulder. The Fourth Cervical sends branches to the middle ganglion of the sympathetic nerve *, to the deep muscles, of .the neck *, glands of the neck ; and it is connected to the phrenic nerve, and to the fifth cervical nerve. The Fifth Cervical Nerve is joined to the fourth and to the sixth cervical. The Sixth Cervical is considerably larger than the preceding, and joins the Seventh Cer- vical Nerves behind the clavicle.

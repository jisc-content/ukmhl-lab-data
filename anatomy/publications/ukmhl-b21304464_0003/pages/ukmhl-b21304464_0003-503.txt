Dr Wrisberg, and Mr Pott, also make men- tion of the intimate connection between the pro- truded bowels, and the testicle, and also of the difficulty of disuniting them. When the testicle has descended no lower than the UNDER ABDOMINAL APERTURE, it somctimes happens, that the intestine slips past it into the scrotum. Mr Pott met with two such cases; the pa- tients could not wear a bandage, on account of its pressure on the testicle. Sometimes the testicle in the groin has proved a cause of strangula- tion. This species of hernia may generally be dis- tinguished from the scrotal, from the difficulty of distinguishing the testicle, which is involved by the protruded parts.

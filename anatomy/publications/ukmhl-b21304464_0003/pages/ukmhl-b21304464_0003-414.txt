OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 386 “ When a Student, I made an experiment along with Mr Emmet, afterwards State Physician in Ireland, of tying up and cutting both carotidcs comjnimes of a dog, w’hich was mentioned then to the Students of Anatomy; and of which, an ac- 'count was afterwards published by Dr Emmet in Ireland, on the supposition, that such an operation might be useful to persons labouring under epi- lepsy and other disorders. “ In the year 1759, when I began to deliver the . whole course of lectures on Anatomy in this Uni- versity, I shewed to the Students, and continued to do so annually, that the humeral artery did not divide into its radial and ulnar branches, till it had got about an inch below the joint of the el- bow ; and, therefore, that the wound commonly made in the artery on bloodletting at the elbow, was made in the trunk of the humeral, and not in the radial artery, as Dr Wm. Hunter had sup- posed. tnrc as those generally found in large aneurisms of long stand- ing ; and along with it a quantity of fluid and grumous blood. The beginning of the sac seemed to be continued with the coats of the artery, but the rest of it to be formed of the neighbouring cellular membranes, &c. in the same manner as the sides of any common encysted tumour. The humeral artery run behind the mQ\\r\smd\ ioe, hill tras impcrviotis for about half an inch, im- mediatehf below where the axillary artery opened into the large .sac, its sides being grown together, as we found by making a hole into the artery below, and introducing a probe upwards, and then cutting open the vessel upon the probe till we came to the part where it was stopped."

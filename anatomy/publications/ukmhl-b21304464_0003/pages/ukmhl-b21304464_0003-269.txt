OF ROSEOLA AND PURPURA. 241 • • . t 2. That accompanied by ulcerous cynanchci • 3. The scarlatina maligna. Roseola. This term has been used to express a rose-coloured efflorescence of the skin, which is of various figures, and the patches are generally larger and more irregular than those of the measles. They are at first red, but soon assume the roseate hue peculiar to this complaint. The fau- ces are often tinged of the same colour, with a slight enlargement of the tonsils. The efflores- cence appears first in the evening or during the night, and continues vivid through the following day. On the fourth day, only slight specks of a dark red colour are perceptible, which disappear on the fifth day. In many cases, the eruption is limited to the face, shoulders or neck. This is not an idiopathic disease ; but is rather connected with fevers of different descriptions. Dr WiLLAN has described the following varie- ties of it; the cEsi ’wa, autumnalis, ammlata, injan- tUis, variolosa, vaccina, and miliaris. Purpura, or Petechice sine Febre.—The petechias sine febre, are small circular purple spots, about the size of a coriander seed, which appear sud- denly and without fever, and go off slowly. VOL.

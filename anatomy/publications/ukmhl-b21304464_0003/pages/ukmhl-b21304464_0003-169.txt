OF THE NOSE. 141* ^rom these oval-shaped bodies, a great number of small nerves pass through the holes in the cri- briform plate. These nerves divide into two fasci- culi ; the one set is distributed upon the septum narium, upon which they form a very intricate plexus. My Father was, I believe, the first who accurately described the course of these small nerves. The other part of the olfactory nerves is distri- buted upon the turbinated processes of the eth- moid bone. The ethmoidal, sphenoidal and frontal sinuses, communicate with the nose, and are lined by the continuation of the membrane which lines the no- strils. The frontal communicate with the ethmoidal sinuses, wdiich communicate with the nose at its upper and lateral parts behind the os unguis. The sphenoidal sinuses open into the upper and back part of the nose, and the maxillary sinuses communicate with the nose by an aperture placed • nearly in the middle between the turbinated pro- cesses of the ethmoid bone and the inferior turbi- nated bones. The air, the vehicle of all odours, when impreg- nated with certain odours, and inhaled, excites the sensation we call smelling •, and to render the sen- sation the stronger, the internal surface of the nos- trils is of very considerable extent; and in gene-

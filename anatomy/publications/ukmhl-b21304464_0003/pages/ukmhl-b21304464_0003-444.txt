At the ninth month it is flat; and there are a number of cavities on its inner side, containing a viscid jelly, which plugs up complete- ly the mouth of the uterus. When delivery has commenced, this jelly is detached, and by extend- ing the mouth of the womb, facilitates labour. This viscid gluten is discharged along'with the liquor amnii, and exhibits a distinct cast of the lacunae of the orifice of the uterus, v/ithin which it had been lodged. The arteries of the uterus at the ninth month are very large and numerous, and freely commu- nicate with each other, and upon the inner side of the womb are remarkably tortuous. The veins of the womb follow the same course as the arteries ; are considerably larger than the arteries; and, on account of their great size, have been named by some anatomists, *cenous sinuses. The lymphatic vessels of the uterus increase as much as the bloodvessels of that organ in conse- quence of pregnancy, and are about the size of a common writing-pen ; very numerous, and form a plexus over the greater part of the substance of the womb.

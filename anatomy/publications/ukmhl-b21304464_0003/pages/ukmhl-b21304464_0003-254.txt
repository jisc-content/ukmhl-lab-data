226 OOTLINES OF ANATOMY, Sect. II. or INFLAMMATION OF THE EYE-BALL, The eye-ball is extremely subject to inflamma- tion, which is sometimes limited only to the in- ternal parts of the eye-ball, or chiefly to the re- tina. When the inflammation is external, vessels fil- led by red blood are seen ramifying upon the cor- nea ; and frequently there are little vesicles con- taining red blood upon the cornea, sometimes ac- companied by the effusion of blood between the tunica adnata and sclerotic coat. There is a kind of inflammation of the eye- ball, which is attended with the discharge of a yel- low or greenish matter ; and this form of the dis- ease has been called the purulent ophthalmia. It may be proper to add, that Mr John Pear- son has described an ophthalmia, connected with, the lues venerea, which bears a strong resemblance to the ophthalmia tarsi of scrofulqus children. . I

DISEASES OF THE PREPUCE AND PENIS. 83 The most frequent organic disease of the sper- matic cord is the varix of its veins ; and Vvhen the veins have,been much distended, the sperma- tic cord becomes of an unnatural size, and is to the feeling soft, and has sometimes been mistaken for an inguinal hernia. Sect. IV>. f ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE PREPOCE, ANO BODY OF THE PENIS. Sometimes the prepuce is so tight, that it can- not be drawn back, which is very inconvenient; for, in this case, the sebaceous matter secreted by the glandulae odoriferae, cannot be washed off; in- flammation follows, and an excoriation, which has been mistaken for a virulent gonorrhoea. The above circumstance led to the practice of drcum- cisim. â–  * Sometimes, when the fore-skin has been drawn back, it cannot be drawn forwards. Sometimes the prepuce has been so much enlar- ged and hardened, that it conceals the glans penis. The glans penis is the seat of herpes and vene- real chancre. Venereal verrucae often appear ori the glans or prepuce. They are of a red colour ; of an irre-^ gular form ; and have a spongy fungous appear- ance ; and are often the remains of chancres. F 2

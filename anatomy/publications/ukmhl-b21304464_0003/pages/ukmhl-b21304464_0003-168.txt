OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 14D laria superiora ; and to the anterior paH of the asal lamella of the ethmoid bone. â€¢ The anterior lateral cartilage is bent forwards, and forms what is commonly called the tip of the nose, and the posterior form the wings of the nose. These cartilages are covered by cellular mem- brane, fat, a number of sebaceous glands, by skin, and by the following muscles, by which they are moved, viz. by the compressor narium, and part of the occipito-frontalis, which is fixed into the nose, and by the levator and depressor labii supe- rioris alaeque nasi. The nose is lined by a spongy and very vascu' lar membrane, which is constantly lubricated by mucus, which exudes from a number of pores on the surface of this membrane. This membrane is not of an uniform thickness, being thinner at the external nares. In the fore-part of the nostrils, there are a num- ber of hairs. The nose is supplied with nerves by the first or" olfactory pair of nerves, and by the fifth pair. The olfactory nerves take their rise by three roots from the corpora striata, situated in the an- terior cornua of the lateral ventricles: they are flattened ; are disposed in grooves in the under part of the anterior lobes of the brain, and ap- proach each other as they pass forwards; and thus terminate in an oval-shaped body, which rests up- on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 52 fected ;'and these affections, which are often limit* cd to the neck of the bladder^ are either idiopa- thic or symptomatic. The bladder is also subject to inflammation, and the inflammation is sometimes limited solely to the neck of the bkdder, arid sometimes to the internal coat of that organ. The inrierrriost coat of the bladder, being a rtii- cous membrane, is subject to all the organic de- rangements of membranes of that description. Polypi, similar to those of other mucous mem- branes *, sometimes grow from the internal coat of the bladder. Fungous excrescences sometimes are found con- nected to the internal coat of the bladder, which are often encrusted by calculous matter. Scirrhous tumours are sometimes found withirl the bladder; these tumours are of different sizes. The bladder has sometimes almost entirely fil- led, by a substance not unlike the brain in its con- .^istence. The veins of the internal chat of the bladder, sometimes become varicose. The bladder sometimes forms part of the con- tents of a hernial sab. I have described a case f, in which the bladder has been displaced, in consequence of a prociden- tia of the rectum, and prolapsus uteri. * Vid. the Description of Polypi, connected with the mu- cous membrane of the stomach and intestines. + Vid, Morbid Anatomy of the Gullet, Stomacli, &c. p. 52S<

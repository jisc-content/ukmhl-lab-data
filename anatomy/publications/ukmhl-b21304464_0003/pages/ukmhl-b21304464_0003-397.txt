VEINS OF THE INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. 8&S The femoral vein receives all the veins which correspond with the branches of the femoral ar- tery, and those of the arteria profunda. The veins, from the inguinal glands and external, organs of generation, are also joined to the deep femoral vein, which passes under the crural arch: it is then named anterior iliac vein. The anterior iliac vein receives the circumflex, epigastric, and sometimes the obturator veins. The hypogastric vein, formed by the conjoined veins, which correspond with the branches of the hypo- gastric artery, is united with the iliac vein. The anterior and posterior iliac veins form the common iliac ; and by the union of the common iliac veins, the Vena Cava Inferior is formed, which, at its origin, receives the sacral and lumbar veinsv Sect.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 422 The placenta, when divided, seems to be com- posed chiefly of bloodvessels, which are distributed through it in all directions. By filling the vessels of the placenta, it becomes about two inches thick; and if the injection be thrown into the arteries of the mother, called uterine^ the injection fills only one-half of the placenta, as that organ consists of two distinct parts, which do not communicate with each other, and between which are cells that are filled by throwing a pe- netrating injection into the arteries or veins of the uterus. These foetal and maternal parts of the placen- ta may be separated from each other, by steeping it for some time in water, until a slight degree of putrefaction has begun. The structure of these distinct parts is not pre- cisely the same ; the portion called fcetal bears a strong resemblance to the lungs, and the arteries of that part terminate in the veins ; but in the maternal part cells are interposed between the smaller ramifications of the arteries and veins, and the cells of the whole placenta freely com- municate with each other.

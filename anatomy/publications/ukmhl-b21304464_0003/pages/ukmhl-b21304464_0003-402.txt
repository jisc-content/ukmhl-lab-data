OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 974 divided into very minute fibrils upon the inner and back part of the leg, and terminates behind the inner ancle, Of the Sacral Ner>ves, The sacral nerves consist of an anterior and pos- terior fasciculus ; the anterior nerves are large, the posterior very small, and distributed upon the back part of the os sacrum and the glutei mus- cles. The anterior sacral nerves fill up the holes in the anterior part of the sacrum, and are united with each other, and with the branches of the sympathetic nerve. The first, second and third sacral nerves join with the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves, and form the Sciatic nerve, the largest nerve of the body. The sciatic nerve passes through the notch of the os ilium ; then between the tuber ischii and trochanter major, where it is covered by the gluteus maximus. The sciatic nerve descends in the back part of the thigh between the long flexor and adductor maximus, and then into the ham. In this course, it gives off small branches to the scrotum of the male, and to the labia of the female ; and to the perineum ; to the long head of the biceps ; and a few subcutaneous branches, Avhich terminate in the skin of the calf of thq

A The intercostal veins correspond in size and si- tuation with the intercostal arteries. The lower aortic left intercostal veins unite, and form the beginning of the Vena Azygos, which crosses the aorta, runs upwards along the spine, and receives during its ascent the intercos- /tal veins of the right side of the chest, as also the bronchial veins, and then joins the Vena Cava Superior. There is also a venous trunk on the left side of the body, called Left Vena Azygos, which is formed by the superior intercostal veins, and bronchial veins of the left side, and veins of the gullet. The left, or smaller vena azygos, terminates in the subclavian vein of the left side.

328 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. From the great cardiac plexus of the left side, a nervous plexus extends on the left coronary ar^ tery ; and from this, small nerves creep along the surface of the left coronary arteries, to the point of the heart *. The cardiac nerves being sent off, the sym- pathetic nerves unite into a trunk behind the subclavian artery, and descend along the heads, and over the heads of the ribs, and a ganglion is formed by their junction with the intercostal nerves f. From the sixth, seventh, and eighth dorsal ganglia, branches arise, which form the nerve calr led by Haller, nervus splanchnicusy which passes through the appendix of the diaphragm, and sup-^ plies the bowels of the abdomen, Of the Intercostal^ or Dorsal Nerves. These nerves, after being sent off from the spinal marrow, are lodged in the grooves in the lower edges of the ribs, and advance to the fore- part of the chest between the intercostal muscles. There are branches of these nerves which sup- ply the muscles in the vicinity of the spine, the intercostal muscles, and also those of the abdo- men. * Vid.

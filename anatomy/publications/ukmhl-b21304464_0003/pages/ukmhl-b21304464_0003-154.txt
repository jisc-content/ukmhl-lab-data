126 OUTLINES or ANATOMY, The brain, when divided by an incision, is found to be neither uniform as to colour nor consistence. The outer part of it is somewhat of a colour resem- bling burnt wood ; soft and very vascular; but in- ternally white or medullary, as anatomists speak, though improperly, as this part of the brain is not like marrow. In the section of the medullary part of the brain, a number of red points, or the orifices of cut vessels may be perceived ; and upon exami- ning with attention the medullary matter, a num- ber of Jibres, disposed in different directions, may be perceived, and more especially by the aid of ' magnifying glasses. The falx cerebri divides the brain only to a cer- tain extent. Upon removing it, a broad white medullary plate, extending horizontally across the brain, and which unites its hemispheres, presents itself: this has been named, from its white and hard appearance, Corpus callosum. A horizontal section of the hemispheres of the brain, made on a level with the corpus callosum, exposes the greatest proportion of medullary to the cineritious substance, and the medullary substance assumes an oval shape. We thus form what has been called the Centrum ovale of Vieussens. There is groove or raphe extending longitu- dinally along the corpus callosum, and on each side of it a medullary chord, from which many transverse fibres proceed.

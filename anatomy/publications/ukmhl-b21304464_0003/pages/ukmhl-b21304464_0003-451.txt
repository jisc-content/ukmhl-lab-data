The ovum consists of the membranes which con- tain the fetus and liquor amnii. There are four membranes in the earlier months, the amnion, chorion, decidua, and decidua rejtexa. A part of the decidua is reflected, forming the fourth covering. Dr Hunter has particularly described this reflection *. D d 4 * It is a membrane of considerable thiclcness, and is some- times of a yellower colour than the decidua vera f. The ovum lies between a part of the decidua reflexa, both of which unite into one membrane at the edge of the placenta; or the decidua vera divides itself at the edge of the placenta into two laminae, i" If it did not lead to some risk of producing an erroneous opinion with regard to the formation of the decidua, I think it would be better to call the decidua vera, by the name of the decidua uteri ; and the decidua reflexa, by the name of the decidua choriL This would render it more easy, to acquir-k â– a clear idea of the whole membranes-

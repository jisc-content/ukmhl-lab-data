12 OUTLINES OF ANATOMy. tudinal direction, a few a circular, and most of them an oblique course. The muscular fibres of the bladder of the foetus are proportionally thicker than those of the adult. The bladder of a child is morp irritable and more powerful ; and the urine can then be dis- charged to a greater distance than in advanced life. The longitudinal fibres form the external stratum. The oblique and circular fibres are placed be- neath the longitudinal ; but these fibres are so much intermixed with the other fibrps of the blad- der, as to render it very difficult to follow out any Onp packet of fibres. Some of the muscular fasciculi of the bladder, in some instances, contract to a great degree, so that the bladder is divided, like a sand-glass, iptp two cavities. The cellular coat of the bladder, is of a white colour, and readily dilated. The innermost coat of the bladder, when distend- ed, is perfectly smootfi, and is besmeared .by a quantity of mucus. The follicles which secrete the mucus haye beep said to be apparent in the catarrhus of the bladder; but I must confess that I never have been able to observe them. The urine is expelled by the joint contraction of the detrusor iirinae, and the muscles of respira- tion ; the muscular fibres around the neck of the bladder being at the same instant relaxed.

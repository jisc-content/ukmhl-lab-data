BRANCHES OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. 359 vides into ascending and descending branches; the former of which, join with the smaller branches of the external eircumflex artery, and the latter with the superior articulating branches of the popliteal artery, and also with a branch derived from the popliteal artery, which is dis- tributed upon the periosteum, covering that part of the thigh-bone in the vicinity of the con- dyles. The arteria profunda femoris, inclines towards the inner side of the thigh, after giving off the circumflex arteries, and is lodged in the cavity be- tween the second head of the adductor muscle, and the vastus internus muscle. There are four perforating arteries, derived from the profunda femoris. The first perforating artery, after having pas- sed through the adductor muscle, appears on the back thigh, about two jinches below the quadra- tus femoris, and divides into two branches ; one of which runs upwards to the great trochan- ter, is subdivided into small branches upon the gluteus maximus muscle, and anastomoses with the smaller branches of the gluteal artery. The other branch passes into the substance of the vas- tus externus muscle, and anastomoses with the smaller ramifications of the external circumflex artery. Dr Ryan made for me a very beautiful prepara- tion of the arteries above described, in which, Z %

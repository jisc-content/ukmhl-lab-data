OF THF VISTIBLE, 185 in number ; the Superior, the Posterior, and Ex- terior. These osseous canals are not of an uniform size, being enlarged at one end, into what has been called by anatomists ampulla; and they include within them cartilaginous canals. Of the Cochlea* The cochlea, so named from its resemblance to a turbinated shell of the snail kind, is composed of two complete turns and a half; and a central pil-. lar, called modiolus, which is continued to the middle of the second turn. These turns are separated from each other .by a partition, called lamina spiralis, into two windings, called its scalce; the one communicates with the tympanum by the foramen rotundum, and is hence called scala tympani; the other communicates with the vestible, and therefore has been called scala vestibuli. These scalae are of'a conical figure; they are narrowest at the apex of the cochlea, where they communicate with each other by a common tube, infundibulum ; one end of which begins at the termination of the modiolus, and the other end is fixed to the osseous top or cupola of the cochlea. My Father has investigated with much care the structure of the cochlea, and his account of it I have subjoined :

ANALYSES OF CONCRETIONS. 507 third portion, digested in a solution of potash, was, excepting a few flakes that remained, entire- ly dissolved. These results allow us to conclude, that the nut-brown substance is principally uric acid. â€œ The white crystalline substance was dissolved by the muriatic acid without effervescence ; It did not flame when heated, and became only slightly discoloured ; the fixed residue it affbrded was fu- sible, when strongly heated. Ten grains of the white substance in powder, heated to dull redness in a bent glass tube, yielded much water, strongly impregnated with ammonia ; the residue was of a slight brownish hue, from the charcoal pro- duced, from an inappreciably minute quantity of animal matter ; the residue weighed only 4.8 grs. It did not change the colour of turmeric paper, nor effervesce with oxalic acid, which only par- tially dissolved it; therefore no oxalat of lime was present. The oxalic solution, separated from the insoluble part by filtration, was precipitated by ammonia. This precipitate, heated to redness, weighed 1.3 grs., and was phosphat of magnesia. The part undissolved in the oxalic acid was oxa- lat of lime, for it affbrded quicklime by calcina- tion. The proportion of this phosphat, would ap- pear equal to 3,5 grains, by deducing the quantity of phosphat of magnesia, from the whole of the fixed residue. Thus, the white envelope, seems to be composed of phosphat of lime, and phosphat

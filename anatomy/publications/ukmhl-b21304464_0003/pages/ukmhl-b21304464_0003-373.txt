ORGANS OF URINE AND GENERATION. 345\ Sect. II. VARIETIES AS TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE AR“ TiiRIES PROPER TO THE ORGANS OF URINE AND GENERATION. Deviations from the usual course of the above 1 arteries seldom occur. Instead of one large renal artery, I have seen tvyo or three separate trunks running to the kid- ■ The pudic artery sometimes is attached to the lateral and inferior part of the bladder of urine and instead of passing outwards between the sa- cro-sciatic ligaments, according to 'Mr A. Burns, “ traverses the upper segment of the prostate gland.” He has added ; “ In all instances of this lusus, which have come to my knowledge, the ar- tery has run above that portion of the prostate gland which projects beyond the side of the ure- thra.” There is considerable variety as to the origin of the obturator artery. Sometimes it takes its rise by a short, and sometimes by a long trunk from the epigastric artery, as has been particularly de- scribed in the article upon Hernia in the Second Voluipe.

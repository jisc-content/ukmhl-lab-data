25 OUTLINES or ANATOMY. composed of the phosphate of lime, resemble chalk ; stain the fingers or cloth; are easily broken; are to the taste insipid ; and insoluble in water, but soluble in nitric or muriatic acids, from which the earth may be precipitated by ammonia or fix- ed alkalies. The calculi composed of phosphate of magne- sia and ammonia, are of a brilliant white ajjpear- ance ; â€œconsist of lamellar crystals ; and their cry- stals assume a prismatic form. These have a sweet- ish taste ; and are very soluble in diluted acids. The thii'd class includes those consisting of the oxalate of lime, and silica; and which are scarce- ly soluble in acids, or in alkalies. Calculi composed of the oxalate of lime, are of a dark chocolate colour ; very heavy ; very hard ; generally rough on their surface ; sometimes resem- bling a mulberry. They seldom or never attain a large sire ; are insoluble in alkalies ; and are very slowly dissolved in diluted acids; and when burnt, a quantity of pure lime, equal to one-third of the calculus, is left. The fourth class contains concretions, which contain a proportion of muriate of ammonia. Such calculi, when^treated with water, are in part dissolved, and the remains consist of pure uric acid. The matter dissolved is composed of urea, and partly of muriate of ammonia. The Jifth class includes those calculi which are composed of cistic oxide. They are white, dense and brittle. 1.

OF THE ORGANS OF TASTE. Ip5 The eighth pair of nerves arises from the sides of the corpora olivaria of the medulla oblongata;, and consist on each side of the pars vaga and glos- so-pharyngeus. Both these nerves pass out through the hole in the base of the skull, common to the temporal and occipital bones. A branch from the glosso-pharyngeus joins with the digastric branch of the portio dura. The glosso-pharyngeus gives off branches, which^ uniting with the pharyngeal branch of the eighth pair and sympathetic nerve, form the plexus which covers the internal carotid artery, from which branches go to the heart. The glosso-pharyngeus supplies the tonsil, the upper part of the pharynx, the epiglottis, and then divides into branches, which are distributed upon the middle of the root of the tongue. The ninth pair of nerves arises from the under and lateral parts of the corpora pyramidalia ; and pass through the superior condyloid holes. The nerv'es of opposite sides are then conjoined by a cross branch with the sub-occipital nerve. The nerve then descends between the internal carotid arte- ry and internal jugular vein ; crosses the carotid arteries, and sends a branch down along the com- mon carotid, called descendens noni. The trunk of the nerve afterwards passes behind the facial and , temporal veins ; and upon the hyoglossus muscle, this nerve divides into many branches, which sup- ply the middle of the tongue, and joins with the ramifications of the lingual branch of the fifth pain Na

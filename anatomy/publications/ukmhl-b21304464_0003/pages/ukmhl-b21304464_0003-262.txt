An obstruction to the flow of tears into the nose, occasions the distention of the lacrymal sac, and a sensible tumour at the internal angle of the eye.

The lacrymal sac sometimes ulcerates, and its contents are discharged externally ; and this is of- -ten attended by a caries of the os unguis. Stricture sometimes occurs in the Nasal Ducts.

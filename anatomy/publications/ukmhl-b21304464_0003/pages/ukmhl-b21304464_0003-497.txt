diseases Ot CHILDREN AT BIRTH. 4)69 woman who has chancres, or by sucking a woman whose breasts are diseased. ' Hydrocephalus may be enumerated among the diseases of the foetus in utero ; the child is born with a large head, and in many cases dies, after making a few convulsive inspirations; but there are others who have lived many years with this disease, and the head gradually attains a larger and larger size, until it measures perhaps thirty- five or forty inches round. The brain of cliildren cut off by this kind of hydrocephalus, hears a strong resemblance to a bag filled with water, and the water is remark- ably limpid and transparent, and contains much less albumen than the water accumulated in cases of dropsy within the chest, belly, or within the vaginal coat of the testis. â€¢ > The substance of the brain is in some cases not above half an inch in thickness ; and when the whole brain and cerebellum have been removed, these are found to have lost a half or two-thirds of their weight. But when the disease comes on a few years after birth, it generally proves fatal in six or eight weeks, and the brain exhibits a very different appearance. It commonly looks as if it had been steeped in water, is not much lighter than in the healthy state, and its ventricles contain generally from a quarter of an ounce to four or five ounces of clear watery fluid.

208 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. OJ the Uses of the Fat. The fat serves a variety of purposes. By filling up the interstices, it gives the members of the body their proper form, and also defends the more delicate parts. It perhaps serves to lubricate the interior parts. The omentum, in structure, very much resembles the subcutaneous fat, and probably renders the sur- face of the abdominal bowels slippery ; as in the quadruped, it extends the whole length of the ab- domen, but in man generally descends no lower than the umbilicus. The fat, like other parts of the body, is constant- ly changing : it exudes, and is wasted by exer- cise, chiefly in consequence of the absorption of it by the lymphatic vessels. -Perhaps fat re-absorbed into the system may serve some very useful purpose in the animal economy. Tat is very nutritious. Dr Stark lived for se-. veral months on suet and water, and was well nou- rished during that time, “ but at last fell a martyr to Cheshire cheese.” Analogy seems to put this point beyond the reach of controversy. Tt has been observed, that dormant animals, though very fat at the com- mencement of winter, become very lean towards its conclusion. The absorption of a considerable quantity of fat has been stated to communicate to the serum of the blood a whitish tinge.

Wc observe that the muscular fibre varies its operation according to the purpose to be ser- ved. That, for instance, when a muscular fibre is punctured, it vibrates, which is the fittest means of throwing off the offending cause ; that the alimen- tary canal, acted on gently by the food, performs a very complex peristaltic motion ; that the abdo- minal muscles act slowly and steadily in ex- pelling the contents of the rectum, but suddenly and convulsively in vomiting; that the blad- der of urine, from which there is a small outlet, performs a slow and uniform contraction in dis- charging its contents, whilst the heart contracts with a jerk. 3. The more we consider the various sponta- neous operations, the more fully we shall be con- vinced that they are the best calculated for the preservation and well-being of the animal *. many of the above arguments against the then common aecounta of the cause of the sympathy of nerves are mentioned, I think it necessary to observe, that I had delivered all the above ar-' guments in my course of lectures eight years before Dr Whytt printed on that subject, and three years before he wrote and de- livered lectures upon it.‚Äù * Vid.

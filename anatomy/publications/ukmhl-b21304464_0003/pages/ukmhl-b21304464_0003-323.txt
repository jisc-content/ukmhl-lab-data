BRANCHES OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 295 part of the scapula, and supply the latissimus dorsi, and subscapulary'muscles, with blood. The axillary artery passes along the origin of the subscapulary muscle, and gives off a large branch, named Infrascapularis ; which divides into two great branches, the scapularis interna, and arteria dorsalis, scapula ii^erior. The Scapularis Interna, passes downwards to the under part of the scapula, giving branches to the teres major and subscapularis muscles; and some of its branches anastomose freely with the arteria dorsalis scapulae superior. The Dorsalis Scapula Inferior, winds round the neck of the scapula to the back-part of that bone, is covered by the infraspinatus muscle, and inosculates, upon the fossa infra spinata, with the branches of the superior scapulary artery. The next considerable branch, has been named the Articularis posterior., which takes its rise between the subscapularis and teres major muscles, and then passes around the posterior part of the os humeri, between that bone and the long head of the triceps, and the deltoid muscles. From this trunk, several small branches of arteries take their rise, which are distributed upon the capsu- lar ligament, the biceps, coraco-brachialis, and sub- scapulary muscles. The CiRCUMFLEXA Anterior, is also a large branch of the axillary artery. It passes transversely between the coraco-brachialis muscle and biceps, â€¢ T4

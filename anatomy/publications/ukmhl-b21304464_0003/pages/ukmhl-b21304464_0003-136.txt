108 OUTLINES or ANATOMY. Sect. VII. OBSERVATIONS ON THE FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVES. The nerves are capable of exercising theiT functions independently of the brain. Various arguments may be employed in sup- port of such an opinion. 1. My Father found, after cutting the sciatic nerve of a frog transversely, and after he had cut out all that part of the spinal marrow to which the pelvis and lower extremities are connected, the circulation of the blood continued for many months in the hind-legs; and after wounding or fracturing the bones, the wounds closed, and callus reunited the disjointed parts of the bones, and many new-formed vessels could be seen in the scars, and in the callus. Now, without the action of the bloodvessels, circulation could not have been continued, nor could the callus have been formed. 2. The application of the ordinary chemical or mechanical stimuli to the nerve, which had been previously divided, and beyond the part of it which had been divided, excited convulsions of the muscles for a length of time. In this in- stance, there can be no influx of nervous fluid from the brain.

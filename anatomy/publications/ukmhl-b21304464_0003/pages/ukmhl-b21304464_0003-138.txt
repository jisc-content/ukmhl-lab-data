OUTLINES or ANATOMY. no By this apparatus, the legs were daily convul- sed several hundred times. After confining the animal in the above state for several weeks, the convulsions continued to be as freqi-ent and violent the last day of the experi- ment as they had been the first. From the above facts, it appears, that nerves may exist after all connection with the brain has been intercepted, and may for a great length of time, not only retain their usual size and struc- ture, but are capable of furnishing nervous tner- gy, sufficient to carry on circulation and secretion, and to excite convulsions of the muscles, when powerful stimuli are applied to the nerves: Therefore, the brain has improperly been named the origin of the nerves; the nerves may with equal propriety be named the origin of the brain. Further, the bulk of the human nerv^es does not bear the same proportion to the brain as those of many quadrupeds and fishes, which feel acute- ly, and exercise their muscles with as much force as we do. The size of the nerves bears a propor- tion to the size of the organs on which they arc spent; but the brain is very small. Further, in some vermes of considerable size, as in the sepia loligo, the brain is exceedingly small; and in the echinus esculentus, it is entirely want- ing. It therefore becomes doubtful, whether we ought, with authors, to consider the brain as the fountain of the proper energy to the nerves^ or

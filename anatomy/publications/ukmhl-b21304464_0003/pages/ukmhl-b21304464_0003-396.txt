OUTLINES OF ANATOMY^ 36d Sect. III. OF THE VEINS OF THE INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. I There are two sets of veins in the inferior ex- tremities, a subcutaneous and deeper-seated set, which communicate with each other freely and re- peatedly. The superficial veins of the inferior extremi- ties, which are situated under the skin, are uni- ted into two trunks, called Venai; Saph^en^. The vena saphaena-minor is formed by the veins of the outer side of the foot. This vein ascends on the outer side of the ancle ; and on the back of the leg upon the gastro- cnemius externus, and terminates in the popliteal vein. The Vena Saph^ena Major, formed by the veins on the upper part of the foot, runs along the inner ancle and inner edge of the tibia, and to the inner and upper part of the thigh, where it passes through the fascia lata of the thigh* and terminates in the deep femoral vein. The deeper-seated set of veins, or vense comites satellites, accompany the arteries. The tibial, fibular and sural veins, terminate in the popliteal vein, which lies over the popliteal artery.

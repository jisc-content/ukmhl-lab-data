OUTLINES OF ANATOMY- 408 its growth, but at tjmes increases rapidly. Such tumours have distinct cysts,* and they contain blood ; and when divided, seem to be composed of a very thick viscid jelly, in which there are a few whiter fibres, which seem to be the continuation of the nervous fibres of the opposite extremities of the tumour. I examined with care a tumour of this descrip- tion, which was connected with the radial nerve of a lady, and caused such acute pain, not only in the tumour, but also through the whole member, that she readily submitted to its removal. The sore healed in about a month, when the tumour returned, and increased rapidly to a great size, from which a fungus grew out. The arm, therefore, was amputated. Two years afterwards, a tumour appeared over the left eye. On opening the head after the pa- tientâ€™s death, the brain was found in a fungus state. The nerves sometimes shrink j as when we lose the sight of one of the eyes, the optic nerve of that eye becomes evidently smaller than that of the other. It may not be improper to add, that the nerves which have been cut through, if kept in contact, are frequentlys reunited by real nervous matter, as has been proved by the experiments of Arne- MAN, CrUICKSHANK*, FoNTANAf, MEYER^yand * Phil.

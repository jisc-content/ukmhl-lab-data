106 . OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. we acquire certain sensations ; as by means of the nerves distributed upon the organs of sense. The terminations of the nerves, which are pro- per to the organs of sense, are only covered by the neurilema ; and hence the nerve seems to the naked eye to be of a delicate fabric •, but when examined by the aid of a powerful magnifying glass, it appaars to be composed of a number of very small threads, which form with .each other a most intricate plexus *. . Sect. Vi The nerves are connected either with the brain or with the spinal marrow ; of the former, nine or ten pairs have been enumerated, besides the sympathetic ; and of the latter, twenty-nine or thirty pairs, besides the nerves, called accessory. The nerves follow somewhat of the same course as the arteries. They are generally so disposed in the cellular substance and fat, or between the in- terstices of the viscera and muscles, or between the processes, or on the inner sides of the bones, as to be as far as possible removed from external injury. * Vid. my Father’s Treatises on the Eye and Ear.,

67 THE CEREBELLUIVt. 131 which the infundibulum, pituitary gland, corpora albicantia, and optic nerves, are. situated. Sect. II. OF THE CEREBELLUM. The cerebellum occupies the inferior cavities .of the occipital bone, and is placed below the pos- terior lobes of the brain *. The cerebellum is in form and sixe very diffe- rent from the cerebrum ; and in different animals bears a different proportional size to the brain. It is rather flattened above, rounded below, and proportionally much broader than the brain, and it presents! a laminated surface ; between which, the pia mater insinuates itself. It, has the same coats as the brain. Like the brain, it is divided into two great lobes; or hemispheres, each of which is subdivided into lobules. In the cerebellum, there is a greater proportion of cineritious substance, than in the brain ; and the medullary matter seems, when the cerebellum is cut vertically, to be distributed through it, some- Avhat like the branches of a tree. I 2 * Gallâ€™s views of the relative situation of the cerebellum, in respect to the brain, and of the appearance of the .surface and intimate structure of the cerebellum, are by far the best wliich have been hitherto published.

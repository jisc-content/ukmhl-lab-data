117 OF SENSATION. the right hand, and then applying th^ left hand to the toes of the other frog, the muscles were im- mediately convulsed. In this last - experiment, the whole electrical matter produced in animal electricity, passed through the nerves alone, and eicited convulsions of the muscles in which they terminate^ whether the electrical matter is passmg upwards or downwards along the nerve and muscle. From these experiments, it is proved, that whilst the electrical fluid is passing from the toes, upwards along the muscles, it does not throw them into convulsions, but that it does so, as soon as it begins to pass along the trunk alone of the nerve. At that instant, therefore, the elec- tricalfluid is moving in the direction upwards, and the nervous energy is moving downwards, from the trunk of ihe nerve into the muscle, or in the trunk of the nerve, the electrical, and the nervous ener- gy are moving and acting in contrary directions. Hence we are led to infer, that the nervous ENERGY IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ELECTRICAL, AND THAT THE NERVE IS MERELY STIMULATED BY THE ELECTRICAL FLUID. The electrical fluid and the nervous, are not the same \ and, further, the electrical shock com- municated by the Torpedo and Gymnotus, does not proceed from the fluid of their nerves. In the first place. The brain, and nerves of the torpedo resemble exactly the same parts in the skate, and other flat fishes \ and hence it is pro- H3

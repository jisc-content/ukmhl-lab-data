OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 3 Of the Bladder of the Adults when Distended. In order to form an accurate opinion of the figure of the bladder, it is necessary to fix the attention, first, upon its anterior; then upon its posterior; and, lastly, upon its lateral por- tions. Upon the bladder being distended, that part of the body of it which lies upon the rectum, in the first place, changes its figure; the fundus ascends towards the umbilicus; the bladder almost fills the cavity of the pelvis; the anterior part of it presses upon the ossa pubis ; the lateral portions are rounded, and the posterior presses upon the rectum. Should the bladder he still further dilated, its body inclines over the symphysis pubis, and forms a manifest tumour above the pubes ; and in conse- quence of the cellular substance \vhich connects the bladder to the ossa pub^s, stretching it, it does not press much upon the rectum ; and in such a distended state, the inferior and anterior part of the bladder is in immediate contact with the abdominal muscles. The inferior part of the bladder is somewhat of an oval form; and the breadth from one side to the Qther is rather greater than from the fore to the back part. The urethra in the adult does not take its rise from the lowest part of the bladder: about the

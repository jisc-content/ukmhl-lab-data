116 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. probe, convulsions of the muscles were not ex- cited. But as a ligature on the nerve did not in the first experiment interrupt the electrical fluid ; and, as in the fourth experiment, the electri- cal fluid did not pass lower than the point of the gold probe, there is no reason for supposing, that it should have passed lower than the point of the probe in the third experiment; and, there- fore, that, in the third experiment, the convul- sions were excited, not by the electrical matter pas- sing into the muscles, hut by the nervous energy roused into action by the stimulus of the electrical fluid. 5. Upon cutting two living frogs across at the loins, and after laying the posterior parts in opposite directions, and placing these on a zinc plate, on touching with a gold probe held in the right hand, the foot of one of the frogs, if the left hand was applied to the toes of the other, there were no convulsions produced. This experiment shews, that the fluid produced in animal electricity, does not excite convulsions of the muscles, u'hether it passes upwards or down- wards through them. 6. But when after placing the posterior parts of the frog in opposite directions, as in the fifth ex- periment, and cutting across all the parts of the pelvis of both frogs, excepting only the trunks of the sciatic nerves, and touching a plate of zinc, put under one frog, with a golden probe held in

164 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. When the eye-lids are open, there is always a wrinkle in the skin in each eye-lid, which is most obvious in the upper, in consequence of the eye- lid being drawn under the edge of the orbit. The eye-lids are composed of thin skin, fat, and a portion of the orbicularis muscle, and of the tarsal cartilages situated at the edges of the eye-lids ; and are connected to the orbits by con- densed cellular substance, which has been impro- perly called ligament. The eye-lids are united at each end, and are said by anatomists to form the angles ox cant hi: The internal is rounded, but the external is acute. The Tarsal Cartilages are not of an uniform breadth ; they are broadest in the centre ; and â€¢ their edges are so shaped, as to form a groove for the tears when the eye-lids are shut. Of the Ciliary Glands. The ciliary glands, which are composed of a number of follicles, are placed between the tarsus and lining of the eye-lids. From these glands, a sebaceous matter is de- rived, which passes the ducts of these glands, call- ed the puyicta ciliariay which are placed upon the edges of the eye-lids.

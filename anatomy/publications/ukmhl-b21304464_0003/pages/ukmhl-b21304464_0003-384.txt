OUTLINÂ£S OF ANATOMY. 356 The artery is covered by the fascia lata of the thigh. The first artery derived from the superficial fe- moral artery, is the superior External Pudic, which crosses the heads of the pectineus and gra- ciles muscles, and gives branches to the ingui- nal glands, to the scrotum, and anastomoses with the branches of the epigastric artery. The small branch of this artery proper to the scrotum, .in some cases of large scrotal hernia?, attains a large size. A little lower down, the Inferior and Exter- nal Pudic Arteries take their rise. These arteries are subdivided into several small branches, which are distributed upon the heads of the triceps adductor femoris ; the pectineus mus- cle ; the skin of the scrotum ; the integuments of the penis; and also upon the skin of the abdo- men which covers the ossa pubis ; and several of the branches of this artery anastomose with those of the penis. About two inches under the crural arch, the fe- moral artery divides into two great branches, which are nearly equal in size. The branch which fol- lows the same direction with the trunk has been called the anterior superficial femoral artery, and the other, which sinks deep among the muscles, the artcria profunda femoris. The trunk of the superficial femoral artery de- scends obliquely to wards the inner side of the thigh;

25 URINARY CONCRETIONS. The greater number of urinary concretions, when divided, exhibit a laniellated structure, and the constituent lamellae are generally different in colour, consistence, density, and chemical com- position ; the external lamellae being often thick- est, porous, and of a white colour. Very few concretions are formed upon an extra- neous body. In the central part of many of them, there are evidently a number of small crystals, glued together by animal matter. It sometimes happens, that one concretion is moveable within another, which is owing to the effusion of blood, occasioned by the irritation of the calculus, which blood shrinking, the smaller calculus is moveable within the larger. As these concretions are formed upon the prin- ciple of crystallization, a urinary concretion may be formed, wherever there is any nucleus to attract the salts of the urine. Urinary concretions may be divided into five classes. The first includes those composed of uric acid, and of urate of ammonia. Such concretions are of a brown or yellow colour, of a lamellar and radiated texture; and are soluble in alkalies. The precipitation is accomplished by acids. The precipitate is soluble in nitric acid; the solution i$ of a pink colour, and tinges the skin red. The second class includes such, as consist of the phosphate of lime, and the phosphate of ammonia and magnesia, which are soluble in acids. Those

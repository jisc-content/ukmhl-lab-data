The cutis vera, according to Dr Thomson, is a peculiar modification of gelatine; and is â€œ ena- bled to resist the action of water partly by the compactness of its texture, and partly by the vis- cidity of the gelatine of which it is formed Sect. II. OF THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SKIN. The skin is subservient to three different pur- poses : it is the seat of the seme of touch ; it is an organ of absorption ; and of secretion. JElvery part of the surface of the body, may be said to be the seat of the sense of touch. Every part of the skin does not possess the same degree of sensibility, the cuticle being much thick- er, and the nerves being more numerous, in some than in other places. By this sense we are less apt to be deceived than by the other senses, there being no intermediate body between the substance and us, when that substance affects the nerves of touch.

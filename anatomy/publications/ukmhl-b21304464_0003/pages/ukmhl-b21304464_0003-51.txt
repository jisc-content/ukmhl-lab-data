23 UJR.INARY CONCRETIONS. OF URINARY CONCRETIONS, AND THE OR- GANIC DEIIANGEMENTS OF THE URINA- RY ORGANS. CHAPTER I. OF URINARY CALCULI, OR URINARY CONCRETIONS. TThe word calculus is by no means applicable to those concretions which are occasionally formed in the urinary passages. Urinary calculi, with the exception of those con- sisting of oxalate of lime and silica, are similar to the constituent parts of the urine, and are merely concretions. These concretions are different ih size, colour^ figure, consistence, weight, and in their chemical ingredients. Urinary concretions may occur in any part of the uriniferous canals, or in any place into which the urine may be effused. B4

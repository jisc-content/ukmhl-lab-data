A a 4 ' OF THE SACRAL NERVES. 3/5 The Popliteal Nerve covers the popliteal bloodvessels of the ham, and is divided below the knee into an external and internal branch, or into a fibular and tibial nerve. The Fibular Nerve detaches the cutaneous nerve, which supplies the gastrocnemius muscle ; a second branch, which passes to the outer part of the leg, and terminates in the same side of the foot; a third branch, which perforates the pero- neus longus, and which ends in the middle of the outer part of the foot. The fibular nerve also detaches deep-seated branches; a branch to the peroneus longus; a branch to the tibialis anticus ; to the extensor pol- licis, and small nerves which adhere to the coats of the tibial artery. A branch also, which accompanies the anterior tibial artery and its ramifications. The Tibial Nerve passes between the heads of the gastrocnemius; perforates the gastrocnemius internus ; passes between the flexor digitorum lon- gus and the gastrocnemius, and along with the pos- terior tibial artery, to the under part of the leg. The branches of this nerve supply the heads of the gastrocnemius, the tibialis posticus, flexor digitorum, aud flexor pollicis muscles. The Tibial Nerve then passes in the"] hollow of the os calcis, and divides into the External and Internal Plantar Nerves. The external plantar nerve gives branches to th e heel; and passing along the foot, divides into

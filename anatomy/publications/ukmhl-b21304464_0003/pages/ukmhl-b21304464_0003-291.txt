' ARTERIES OF THE HEAD. 263 The left coronary artery passes between the left auricle and ventricle, and is subdivided into ante- rior and posterior brancheSj which are distributed on the left side of the heart. The aorta, after having sent off the coronary ar- teries, rises upwards, and somewhat to the right side ; then passes over the right branch of the pul- monary artery ; it then forms an arch opposite to the two uppermost dorsal vertebrjE, which passes over the left branch of the trachea, behind which it descends. From the arch of the aorta, three large trunks usually take their rise ; the arteria innominatai common to the right carotid and right subclavian arteries; and the left carotid and left subclavian arteries, which are separate trunks. Sect. IV; OF THE ARTERIES OF THE HEAD, AND SOME OF THOSE OF THE NECK. The head is supplied with blood by the Caro- ' TiD and Vertebral arteries. The Carotid Arteries ascend on each side of the vertebrae of the neck, between the internal ju- gular vein and the trachea, and behind the exter* nal extremities of the stcrno-mastoid muscles. R4

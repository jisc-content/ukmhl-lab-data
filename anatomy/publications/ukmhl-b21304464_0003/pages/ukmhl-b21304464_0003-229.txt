OF THE CUTIS VERA.. 201' The fibres of the cutis vera are very intimate- ly interwoven with each other, like those in the felt of a hat, and cross each other in every di- rection, so that it is impossible to trace their course. The skin of the extremities of the fingers and toes, is disposed in ridges. There are a number of papillae or small pro- cesses, on the surface of the cutis vera, and which are most numerous in the more sensible parts of the body, as upon the lips, the penis, and at the points of the fingers and toes, where they are placed in double rows upon the ridges. These papillae have commonly been supposed to be formed by the terminations of the nerves of the skin, and of a plexus of small bloodvessels. , In the skin of the belly and thighs of women who have had children, there is a growth of an imperfect new skin, between the parts of the true skin. In the human body, there is no muscle which extends over the whole body like the thin mus- cle which corrugates the skin of the horse or the dog. The only muscles in the human body which bear an analogy to it, are the occipito-frontalis and platysma myoides.

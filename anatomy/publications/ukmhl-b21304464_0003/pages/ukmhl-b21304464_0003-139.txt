Where the mind is influenced, we are said to feely in the common sense of the word. But in many instances, where the nerve of a muscle is diseased, or has been divided, or after the heart or other muscle has been separated from the body, the puncturing the muscle produces convulsive actions. Such an effect cannot be explained on mechani- cal principles: hence there probably has been some kind of feeling, which has produced an ac- tion which may be compared to the feeling which vegetables seem to possess, *in consequence of which their juices are moved and changed by se- cretion.

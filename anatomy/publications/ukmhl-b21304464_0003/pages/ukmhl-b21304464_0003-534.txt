-APPENDIX. S06 ter. Ammonia was added to the muriatic solu- tion, and the precipitate well washed and dried, weighed 6-4 grs. Heated to redness, it inflamed, and afforded a white earth, which had the caustic taste of quicklime. It was dissolved with effer- vescence in muriatic acid, and the salt obtained by the evaporation of this solution to dryness was completely redissolved by water,â€”a proof of the absence of all insoluble phosphats.. It may, there- fore, be concluded, that the 6.4 grs. were oxalat of lime. To ascertain whether the nucleus con- tained any water, 10 grs. of it were heated in a bent glass tube ; the result was, the production of a quantity equal to a drop or two. From these experiments, the nucleus seems to consist of uric acid, oxalat of lime, and water, in the following proportions per cent.: 30 uric acid. 64 oxalat of lime. 6 water. 100 ** The nut-brown substance exhibited all the charateristic properties of uric acid. Heated before the blow-pipe, it inflamed, emitted an am- moniacal odour, and was almost entirely consum- ed ; The ash that remained from five grains was just visible, and not a quantity nearly sufficient for examination. Another portion of it, heated with nitric acid, acquired the pink colour j and a

63 OF THE OVARIAr 1 SiiCT. II. OF THE OVARIA. I The ovaria constitute the most essential part of the female organs of generation for trom these, the rudiment of the foetus is derived. The ovaria somewhat resemble the testes in shape and size, in the prime of life, but are more flattened laterally, and their long diameter is plaeed transversely. In old age, the ovaria become much smaller. The ovaria in young women, are sometimes ir- regular on their surface. The ovaria consist of a spongy yellowish substance ; within which, the transparent ovula are contained, which are inclos- ed within a dense cellular covering, and perito- neum. That a something necessary to impregnation is derived from the ovarium, is obvious; 1st, As those women are barren whose uterine tubes are obstructed. 2d, From the remarkable difference between the ovaria of a virgin, and those of a woman, who has had children. Upon examining the ovarium after impregnation, a cavity is found within it, which is particularly observable in the cow, is in- closed by a substance which, from its colour, has been called corpus luteum.

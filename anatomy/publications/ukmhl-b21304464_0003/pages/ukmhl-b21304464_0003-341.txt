NERVES OF THE ARM, &-C. 31S • hand, where it is covered by a thick tendinous apo- neurosis ; and in that situation, ‘divides into seven branches; two of* which lead to the thumb, one to the side of the fore-finger next the thumb. The other branches are derived from two trunks, and supply the opposite side of the fore-finger, both sides of the middle finger, and the side of the ring-finger next the middle finger. * There are several smaller n.erves also sent from the radial nerve, which are distributed upon the lumbjicalcs muscles; and there are others which accompany the branches which form the super- ficial palmar arch. The nerves of the opposite sides of the fingers are united at their points, and at length terminate by a great many small nerves. • 6th, Ulnar Nerve. This large nerve passes along the triceps muscle ; and. at the elbow, oc- cupies the groove between the inner condyle of the os humeri and olecranon ulnae. The nerve then passes through the heads of the flexor muscles, and follows the same course as the ulnar artery along the fore-arm. Near to the lower end of the ulna, there arc iXL'O or three, small branches sent off, which pass to the back of the hand, * between the ulna and the flexor carpi ulnaris; from* which there are various small nerves, which supply the wrist, and which jom with the branches of the spiral nerve. ,

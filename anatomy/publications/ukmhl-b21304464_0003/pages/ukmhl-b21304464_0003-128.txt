100 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. mal; and the spinal marrow very much exceeds in bulk any of the nerves connected with it; but the spinal marrow of some warm-blooded animals IS much larger in proportion to the brain, and especially in fishes. In these animals the trans- verse diameter of the brain scarcely exceeds that of the spinal marrow. The acuteness of the intellectual faculties pro- bably depends on the bulk of the brain ; whereas the force and rapidity of voluntary motion appear to depend upon the proportion of the nerves dis- tributed to the organs of sense. In those animals which are superior to man in strength, the nerves are larger ; and in the classes of Fishes and Insects, which are remarkable for the acuteness of their feeling, and the rapidity of their motions, the nerves of the limbs are much larger than in the human body. The higher orders of animals have the same number of senses as man; but many of the infe- rior animals are destitute of some of these. The nerves appear to be tough cords, which is owing chiefly to their investing membranes. Upon dissecting a nerve, it is found to be covered by membranes similar to those which cover the brain. The outer membrane is very tough, and fibrous in structure ; the second coat is much thinner, and the third is a vascular membrane, similar to the pia mater of the brain. Besides these cC)ats, there is a membrane which divides each nerve into its component filaments,

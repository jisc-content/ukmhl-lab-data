DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. 35'. 3. In some rare cases, the greater part of the urethra has been constricted, as when the urine does not flow through it, but through an artificial opening in the bladder. 4. Stricture of the urethra sometimes originates from the imperfect formation of that canal. The urethra behind the stricture is much enlar- ged, and sometimes it gives way, and the urine is discharged at a fistulous orifice in the perineum. Ej:planatio)i of Plate- 4t0th. This plate was copied from a specimen of an unusual variety of stricture, which was followed by a fistula in perineo. . The urethra between the stricture and the bladder, was somewhat enlarged, as also that portion between the stric- ture and the glans, so that the urethra represents two cones, with their apices joined at the stricture. The coats of tlie bladder were also somewhat thick- ened. r A probe has been inserted into the fistula.

82 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. On account of the firmness of the coats of the testicle, an inflammation of that organ is attended with great pain, as the membrane does not readily yield. The coats of the testicle admit of considerable extension, as is evident in cases of swelled testi- cle and hydrocele, or when blood has been effused within them ; and they also regain their former bulk, upon the water which had distended them, being removed ; and whence we infer that they possess a considerable share of contractility. The coats of the testicle sometimes have been partially ossified, and cartilaginous bodies have frequently been observed growing from them. Sect. III. OF THE ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE SPER- MATIC CORD. The spermatic cord partakes of many of the organic derangements of the testes above descri- bed ; thus it is reduced to a scirrhous, or to a scrofulous state, when the substance of the testi- cle is in that morbid state. Sacs, containing water, sometimes adhere to the spermatic cord, or are found within it. Polypi are sometimes connected to the sper- matic cord, and have been mistaken for ingui- nal herniae.

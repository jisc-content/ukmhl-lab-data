J36 •• - OUTLINES OF ANATOMY* upon the villous coat are subdivided into very mi- nute branches, which terminate upon the villi. There are several small branches of this artery sent to the pancreas, which afterwards supply the duodenum, and anastomose with the branches of the cceliac. The larger branches of this artery on the left side convey blood to the jejunum and ileum; and these branches anastomose with each other by transverse arches. The larger branches of this artery on the right side are placed between the layers of the mesoco- lon, and have been named, ^ 1st, The Colic A Media, or Anastomotica, which supplies the middle of the transverse arch of the colon ; and the left branch of this artery commu- nicates with the colica sinistra, and inferior me- senteric artery. 2d, The Colica Dextra ; by means of which the right side of the colon is supplied with blood. 3d, Small branches, which are distributed on the omentum, and communicate with the arteriae gas- tro-epiploicae. ‘ ^ 4th, The Ileo-Colic, which supplies that part of the ileum which terminates in the colon j and from which a branch is derived, which commu- nicates wdth the colica dextra.

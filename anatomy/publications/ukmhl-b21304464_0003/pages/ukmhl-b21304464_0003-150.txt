OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 122 the middle horizontal partition between the great and smaller brains. The tentorium cerebello superextensum, or trans- verse middle septum, is fixed to the grooves and transverse ridges of the os occipitis, to the ridges or partes petrosae of the temporal bones, and to the posterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid bone. Between the transverse septum and posterior clinoid processes, there is an oval-shaped aperture, where the cerebrum and cerebellum are united. The falx and tentorium cerebello superexten- sum, the connected and continuous processes of the dura mater, support and stretch each other, and prevent the opposite sides of the brain from gra- vitating upon each other when we lie on either side; and also support the posterior lobes of the larger brain from pressing on the smaller brain. The falx minor or septum, between the hemi- spheres of the smaller brain, is fixed to the middle perpendicular ridge of the os occipitis, and termi- nates at the edge of the foramen magnum ossis occipitis. There are also venous sinuses on the base of the skull, formed by the dura mater. On each side of the sella sphenoidalis, the dura mater is extended between the anterior and posterior clinoid processes. The dura mater lines the superior orbitary fis- sures, and the foramina of the skull; and the du- ra mater also forms a sheath for the spinal mar- row.

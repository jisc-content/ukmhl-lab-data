40 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. ^ 3. Some worms are multiplied by being divided^ as polypi, &c.; in these, there is no distinction of sexes, no copulation. 3. In some instances, both sexes are united in the same individual, as in the hermaphrodite, and in monoecious plants; but in others, though each individual possesses the parts of both sexes, yet the assistance of another individual, which it fe- cundates, or by which it is fecundated, is ne- cessary, as in many worms and snails. 4. In the higher orders of animals, the sexes are distinct^ and certain organs of the male are ap- propriated to the formation of a fecundating liquor, and there also are certain organs of the female which may be fecundated. Fecundation is accomplished by the deposition of the male semen, in or about the germ. In many instances the semen is applied to the ova only after they have been deposited, as in many fishes, and frogs. In the class Mammalia, the semen is introduced by the penis into the vagina during copulation; thus the ova are fecundated within the body of the female, and the foetus is not discharged until it is capable of independent existence. The effect of copulation is very different in differ- ent classes of animals. In general, only one preg- nancy is the result; but in some'animals, as in do- mestic fowls, the influence of a single copulation extends to all the eggs the hen lays in eight or ten successive days \ and it has been stated, that

203 OF THE SENSE OF TOUCH. Dr Reid has justly observed : “We perceive not one quality only, but many, and these of dif- ferent kinds. The chief of these are heat and cold, hardness and softness, roughness and smooth- ness, figure, solidity, motion, and extension; where- as the senses of smelling, of tasting and hearing, are very simple and uniform ; each of them ex- hibiting one kind of sensation, and thereby indi- cating only one of the qualities of the bodies.” There are some animals, as the bat, which are so constructed as to receive such delicate impres- sions of resistance, motion and temperature, that 'Spallanzani has been led to suppose that they possess a shth sense. He observed, that these animals when set at liberty, after he had put out their eyes, and had stopped their ears and noses, were capable of flying through subterraneous crooked passages vvithout striking against the walls, and even avoided many obstacles which were put in their way. The skin is also an organ of absorption. There are some anatomists who have described the man- ner in which the absorbent vessels of the skin take their rise from that organ. But I believe that the absorbent vessels of the surface of the human skin cannot be demonstrated, though there cannot be a doubt that the skin is an organ of ab- sorption ; for mercury, turpentine, and various other substances rubbed upon the skin, are rapid- ly taken into the general system.

6 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. The bladder of infants is proportionally larger than in adults. In consequence of continued distention, the blad- der acquires a larger size in women who lead a se- dentary life, or who live much in society, and are in the habit of retaining their urine for a long time: it becomes not only longer, but also much broader, and generally, as Celsus has observed, in- clines to one side. The figure of the bladder rvaries no less than its size. The bladder of the foetus is in figure like a pear, and its length is nearly three times greater than its transverse diameter, and a small part only of it is contained within the pelvis; for the fundus vesicae ascends very near to the umbilicus. The anterior part of it is not covered by the peritoneum ; so that at this period of life it is possible, when the bladder is. only half-full, to make an opening into it above the ossa pubis. The upper aperture of the pelvis of the foetus is so small, that the rectum distended by the me- conium, almost fills the whole pelvis. When a child is three or four years old, the pelvis has generally attained such a size as to admit the blad- der. Of the Figure of the Bladder in the Adult, The bladder of the adult is much shorter in proportion than in the foetus in its undistended

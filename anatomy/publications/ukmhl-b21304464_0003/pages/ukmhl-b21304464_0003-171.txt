COATS OF THE EYE-BALt. 143 Three coats have been enumerated, as being proper to the eye-ball; and there is a fourth, by which it is retained in its proper place, called Tunica adnata. Tht'tunica adnata is merely a reflection of the skin from the eye-lids, which extends over the eye-ball, serving to fix it in its place, and to pre- vent extraneous bodies from passing from the fore to the back part of the orbit. A small quantity of cellular substance inter- venes between this coat and the white of the eye. The tunica sclerotica, an opaque, white, elastic, dilatable, fibrous membrane ; is of unequal thick- ness ; has few vessels on it, derived from the ci- liary arteries; and possesses little sensibility. This coat surrounds the whole ball of the eye, ex- cepting that part of the ball occupied by the cor- nea. This coat is tough and strong, and well calculated for determining the shape of the eye, and for sup- porting and defending the more delicate and more useful parts of that organ. The tendons of the ,muscles which move the eye-ball are fixed to the sclerotic poat. The Cornea which forms the convex transpa- rent part of the eye-ball, consists of many thin plates, united by cellular substance ; and these, when united, form one plate, which is thickest in the centre. The cornea is covered by the thin edge of the tunica sclerotica, I

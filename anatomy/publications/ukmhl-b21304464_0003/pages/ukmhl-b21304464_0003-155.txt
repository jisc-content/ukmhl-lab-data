OF THE BRAIN. 127 On cutting down on each side of the corpus callosum, we get into two oblong cavities, placed horizontally, and which Baron Haller has named, on account of their figure, Ventriculi tricornes, each of them having three cornua. The anterior and posterior cornua of the late- ral ventricles, are placed nearly horizontally ; the middle cornua descend, and then run forwards into the middle lobes of the hemispheres. By a vertical section, the corpus callosum is found to be bent downwards at its anterior and posterior parts; the continuation of which latter forms what anatomists have called the Fornu', from its resemblance to a vault. Between the corpus callosum and fornix, the septum, called lucidum, is placed, which is nar- row before, becomes gradually broader, and is composed of two plates of medullary substances. The fornix has four crura or pillars, two anterior and two posterior ; and the latter are the larger, and descending into the inferior cornua of the lateral ventricles, form distinct processes, which have thin puckered edges, and have been called the Corpora fimbriata. The under part of the fornix is joined to the Thalami Nervorum Opticorum, by a membrane called Tela choroidea. There is an oval aperture of communication between the lateral ventricles of the brain and the third ventricle, which has been described by my Father, in his book on the Ner-

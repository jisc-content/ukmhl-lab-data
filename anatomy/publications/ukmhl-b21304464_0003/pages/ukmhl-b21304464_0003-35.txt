BLADDER OF THE ADULT. 7 state, and it is contained within the cavity of the pelvis, unless when much distended. Of the Bladder when Undistended. The bladder, when undistended, has somewhat of a triangular figure ; the fundus of it is direct- ed towards the urachus, is nearly on a level with the symphysis pubis, and rests upon the rectum of the'male, and vagina of the female. When the bladder is very much contracted, as in persons who have suffered a violent death, the figure of the bladder is somewhat rounded, and si- tuated lower down in the pelvis. In the contracted state of the bladder, the peri- toneum is loose between the bladder and rectum ; and in this state of the bladder, the rectum forms a considerable projection inwards upon the blad- der ; and in women, it is more obvious, as the va- gina adds to the bulk. Thus the bladder is di- vided into two lateral projections, in which calcu- li are frequently lodged; and in women, who have had several children, these lateral projections of the bladder become still more manifest. The cellular substance around the bladder is very loose, and especially that between it and the superior part of the symphysis pubis; whereas that between the rectum and bladder is more dense and less capable of dilatation.

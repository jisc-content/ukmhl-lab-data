OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 284 Theportio dura then leaves the aqueduct, passes through the foramen stylo-mastoideum, irom which ^ a number of small nerves issue out, which supply the parotid gland, the muscles of the eye-lids, face, and neck, and which join with those of the supe- rior maxillary nerve upon the face Oj the Eighth Pair of Nerves. The.Eighth Pair of Nerves takes its rise by se- veral roots from the bases of the corpora olivaria, and consists of two parts, the par vagum ■a.nd glosso- pharyngcus ; the latter has been already described. The Par vagum, descends in the same cellular sheath with the jugular vein, and common caro- tid. From the par vagum, the following branches are derived : « 1. The Pharyngeal Branch, the branches of ■ which, supply the posterior part of the constrictor muscles of the pharynx, and other branches join * Vid. Monro’s Nervous System, p. 43. " The'most remarkable connection of this kind is in tli6 human face, whoie the portio dura of the auditory nerve is joined to the second and third branches of the fifth pair of nerves. Many of these nerves joined, are so small, that it is difficult to trace the fibrils of which they consist; but, in the larger branches, both in man ‘ and in the ox, I have certainly found, that the smaller branches which come off beyond the union of two larger nerves, consist ef fibres from both.”

CONGENITAL HERNIA OF THE MALE. 473 constricted part of the canal, and had attained an unnatural bulk. The canal for the testes has been sometimes observed to be contracted at its upper, and also in its under parts, and sometimes, according to Dr Wrisberg, in two different places at the same time. Sometimes the testicles are detained in the groin, and have been mistaken for an inguinal hernia, and upon that supposition, trusses have been worn. The size and figure of this hernia is various, and depends upon the situation of the stricture in the canal; should the stricture be seated near to the under part of the scrotum, the hernial tumour then assumes an oblong figure, and is equally large in its upper, as in its under part, and the tumour passes out perpendicularly from the abdomen ; be- cause, in a child at birth, the spermatic cord docs not pass obliquely through the parietes of the ab- domen, as in the adult, but passes directly through these, and hence the peculiar shape of the herniary tumour. Lobstein has described a case of congenital hernia, in which the tumour descended as low as the knee. 7 he sac of the congenital hernia sometimes ac- quires a preternatural thickness, sometimes it is of an unusual thinness. Mr Arnaud relates a case, where the sac was so thin, that he divided it, in

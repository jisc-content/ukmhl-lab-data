OUTLINES OP ANATOMY, 384 A large artery is derived from this trunk, called the Gastric A Inferior Sinistra, which passes along the greater curvature of the stomach, and communicates with the gastrica dextra. From this artery, the pancreas, omentum and mesocolon receive several small branches. There are four orjwe branches of the splenic artery, call- ed vasa hrevia, which are spent on the great left sac of the stomach, and anastomose with the branches of the left superior and left inferior gas- tric arteries. The Hepatic Branch, or Right Branch of the CoELiAC Artery, is concealed by the pan- creas ; it passes forwards and upwards behind the pylorus ; and, near to the neck of the gall-blad- der, divides into the Gastrica Inferior dex- tra, and the proper Hepatic Artery. From the gastrica dextra, the following branches are derived : The Arteria Pylorica, which supplies the pylorus; The duodenalis, which is dispersed on the right portion of the duodenum; Small branches to the pancreas. The trunk of the artery then passes along the great curvature of the stomach, and anastomoses with the arteria epiploica sinistra, a branch of the splenic artery. The hepatic artery, during its progress along the great curvature of the stomach, is subdivided into the following branches ;

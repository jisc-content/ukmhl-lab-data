84) OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. The acrid matter of the glandulae odoriferce, scrofula and scurvy, sometimes produce ulceration of the glans penis somewhat like to that occasion- ed by lues venerea. Cancer of the penis sometimes occurs in advan- ced life ; it begins like a warty excrescence ; and from the glans, the disease extends to the body of the penis. ' Sometimes the disease begins in the prepuce, and extends to the glans and along the body of the penis ; and at length destroys that organ. Ossification of the corpora cavernosa penis some- times takes place. Gangrene should also be enumerated among the organic derangements of the penis, and is frequent- ly the effect of venereal chancres that have been improperly treated. Ulcers have sometimes, though'very rarely, been observed in the urethra. Calculi sometimes have stuck partly in the ure- thra, and partly within the neck of the blad- der. Calculi have also been lodged within the ure- thra, and sometimes under the prepuce. In some instances, the urethra has terminated behind the glans penis.

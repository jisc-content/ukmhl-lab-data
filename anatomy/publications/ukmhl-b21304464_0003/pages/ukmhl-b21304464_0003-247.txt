A watery fluid is frequently collected within the ventricles of the brain, and sometimes, though rarely, between the membranes of the brain. The quantity of watery fluid collected is very- various, amounting in some instances to one or two ounces only, but in others to several pounds. Children are sometimes born with this disease ; the bones of the skull are disunited from each other, as in Plate xxii; and the head thereby at- tains an unnatural magnitude ; the child in a few instances lingering under the disease for several months or years. Such has usually been called the chronic form of hydrocephalus. In other instances, the water is rapidly effused after the bones of the skull have been consolidat- ed, and the patient generally dies in four or five weeks; this is the acute hydrocephalus. There is a third and intermediate stage, which has not been described by any author with wâ€™hose works I am acquainted. In this form of the disease, the sutures of the adult give way ; the bones of the skull are separated j and the patient lingers under the disease for several months. When a large quantity of water has been ac- cumulated within the ventricles of the brain, these

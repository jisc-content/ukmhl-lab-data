518 ANATOMY. They possess valves, and, according to Rivington, both spermatic veins have usually valves at their orifices. In the female the Ovarian veins ascend from the ovaries and terminate like the male spermatic veins. They form in each broad ligament a plexus, which anastomoses with the veins of the uterus. Rivington observed their valves to resemble in arrangement those of the spermatic veins. The Renal veins pass almost transversely, one from the hilus of each kidney, into the sides of the vena cava. The left renal vein is longer than the right, and crosses in front of the abdominal aorta. Crisp and Rivington have observed valves in these veins, especially where they join the inferior cava. The SuPRA-EENAL or Capsulae veins lie just above the renal, and proceed from the supra-renal capsules; the right opens into the inferior cava, the left into the left renal, or sometimes the phrenic vein. The Pheenic veins open into the inferior cava, close to the diaphragm. The Hepatic veins arise in the substance of the liver from the capillaries of the lobules; they converge to the fossa in which the inferior cava is situated, and open into it. The Common Iliac vein is formed by the junction of the external and internal iliac veins. It commences near the sacro-iliac joint, and ascends to the level of the disc between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebral, when it joins its fellow to form the inferior vena cava. As the junction takes place to the right of the mesial plane, the right vein is shorter than the left, and ascends nearly verti- cally behind, and then to the outer side of the right

ANATOMY. 548 The lymphoid tissue in the centre of a lymph follicle has a more open meshwork than at the periphery, where the reti- form tissue is more compact and often simulates the appear- ance of an investing capsule. When a number of folUcles lie close together, as in a Peyer’s patch, the separate follicles may be connected together by intermediate retiform tissue. The lymph follicles possess considerable vascularity. Not only do the blood-vessels form a network around the follicles, but, as may easily be seen in injected solitary and Peyer’s glands, capillaries pass from the periphery to the centre of each follicle, and form in it a wide meshed plexus, the strands of which are in relation to the susten- tacular framework.

In the solitary and Peyer’s glands of the intestine, where their arrangement has been chiefly studied, a net- work of lymph capillaries has been seen around the peri-

TEETH. 759 is produced from the epithelium, and the dentine, pulp and cement from the sub-epithelial connective tissue. The development of the temporary teeth will first be con- sidered. If a vertical section he made through the mouth of a young human embryo about the 6th or 7th week, its cavity may be seen to be lined by a stratified epi- thelium, continuous with the layer ■ of stratified epiblast forming the c.uticle of the face. Along the edge of the gum, corresponding in position to that of the future jaws. Fig. 208.—Vertical transverse section through the Mouth of a young Human embryo, np, naso-palatine region; t, tongue; m, mouth; I, I, 1,1, lips; d, d, primitive dental grooves with epithelial contents in upper gum; d', d', similar structures in lower jaws; «, e, cuticular epiblast; A, A, hair follicles; e', epiblast prolonged into the mouth. the epithelium is of some thickness, and an involution of the epithelium into the subjacent connective tissue has taken place. Owing to this involution a narrow furrow or groove in the connective tissue is produced, which con- stitutes the primitive dental groove of Goodsir, This groove is not, however, an empty furrow, but is occupied by the involuted epithelium. The sub-epithelial connective tissue is soft and gelatinous, and abounds in corpuscles, which are especially abundant in the connective tissue at the

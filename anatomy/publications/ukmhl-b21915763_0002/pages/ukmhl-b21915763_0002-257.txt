STRUCTUEE OF LUNGS. 637 from its funnel-shaped form, whilst the lumen of the ter- minal bronchus is named the lohular, or alveolar passage The relation of the air cells to the lobular passage is not Fig. 174.â€”Semi-diagramatic longitudinal section through an Infundibulum. 6, terminal hroncliial tube; 16, lobular passage; ua, air-vesicles; in a'the nu- cleated elastic membranous wall of a vesicle is shown ; a, pulmonary artery; c, c, pulmonary capillaries; e', ciliated epithelium; e, e, tesseiated epithelium lining air-cells. unlike that of a number of small chambers opening into a common corridor. The air-vesicles have an average dia- meter of about inch, though they not unfre- quently are larger in size, and are always bigger at the end than at the commencement of an inspiration. The air- vesicles in the same infundibulum are separated from each other by septa, or partitions, so that they do not com- municate directly with each other, but only through the common corridor, or lobular passage : it should be stated, however, that these partitions sometimes break down, and permit contiguous air-vesicles to communicate. The air- cells in adjacent infundibula do not communicate at all, but are separated by a thin layer of intermediate connective tissue, and by the pulmonary capillaries.

I;YMPHATIC GLANDS. 549' phery of the follicles. Frey has described the bases of these follicles as invested by a system of spaces or pas- sages, continuous with and capable of being injected from the lymphatic system. It is possible that these spaces communicate with the meshwork of the retiform tissue of the follicle, but the communication has not been definitely ascertained. There can be no doubt, however, that the lymph follicles are appendages of the lymph-vascular system, and are the seats of production of lymph corpuscles. Nothing is known of the arrangement of the nerves in relation to the lymph-follicles. Lymphatic Glands. The Lymphatic Glands are nodal swellings occurring in the course of the lymphatic vessels. They are abundantly distributed throughout the body, and are found in clusters in the groin, axilla, neck, chest, abdomen, &c,, as has been described in the section on the distribution of the lymphatic vessels. They often are arranged as a chain of glands connected together by intervening lymph vessels. They are round or oval in shape, and vary in size from a small shot to a kidney bean. It is not uncommon for the glands to enlarge and for adjacent glands to become fused together. Each gland receives at one end several lynlphatic vessels called vasa afferentia, and from it lymphatic vessels, called vasa efferentia, emerge; which in their onward course may become afferent vessels for glands situated higher in the course of the lymphatic vessels (fig. 150). Where the efferent vessels pass out of a gland a depre.ssion on its surface, named the hihis, is often seen.

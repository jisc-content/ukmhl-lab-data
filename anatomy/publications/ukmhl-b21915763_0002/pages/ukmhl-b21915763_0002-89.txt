EXTERNAL CAROTIE ARTERY. 469 nator; deep temporal branches which enter the deeper surface of the temporal muscle. The third set of branches arise in the spheno-maxillary fossa, and enter foramina or fissures in the bones of the head. They are as follows ;—superior maxillary branch runs downwards and forwards on the upper jaw, supplies the gum, and sends superior dental branches through small foramina in the upper jaw, which accompany branches of the superior dental nerve to the pulps of the upper teeth : infra-orbital branch enters the infra-orbital canal, and emerges on the face, along with the infra-orbital nerve, at the infra-orbital foramen; it supplies the lower eyelid and adjacent parts of the face; descending palatine branch runs down the posterior palatine canal along with the descending palatine nerve, and emerges at the posterior palatine foramen on the back of the hard palate to supply the palatal mucous membrane : spheno-palatine branch runs inwards to the nose, along with the spheno-palatine nerve, and supplies the nasal mucous membrane; one branch runs down the nasal septum, and appears on the roof of the mouth at the anterior palatine foramen : vidian branch passes backwards by the side of the vidian nerve through the vidian canal, and supplies the Eustachian tube and adjacent part of the pharynx : pterygo-palatine branch runs backwards, along with the pterygo-palatine nerve, through the pterygo-palatine canal to the roof of the pharynx. The branches of the external carotid artery may be arranged according to their distribution in five groups :— Is^. To thyroid body and larynx : superior thyro artery. 2d. To tongue : lingpal artery.

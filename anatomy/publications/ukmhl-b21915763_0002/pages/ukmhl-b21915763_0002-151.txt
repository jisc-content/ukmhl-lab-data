531 LYMPHATIC VESSELS. opposite tlie body of the first lumbar vertebra, they enter the receptaculum chyli or dilated commencement of the thoracic duct. As the lacteals ascend in the mesentery they pass through a number of bodies, about the size of, or some- what larger than, flattened peas, called the mesenteric glands, and as they unite in their ascent, they diminish in numbers and form larger vessels than when they emerged from the coats of the bowel. Similar vessels, though fewer in number, arise in the mucous membrane of the large intestine, but not in intes- tinal villi- They also ascend to join the thoracic duct, and pass through glands similar to those within the mesentery. , Distribution of the Proper Lymphatic Vessels. The Proper Lymphatic Vessels are. situated in the other parts of the body than [the intestine and its mesenteric folds. By their junction with each other they form two lymphatic trunks, named the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct. The Thokacic Duct commences in the cavity of the abdomen about opposite the body of the first or second lumbar vertebra, where it forms a dilatation, the recepta- culum chyli, which receives not only the lacteal vessels, but the lymphatics from the other abdominal viscera, from the abdominal walls, and from the lower hmbs. The thoracic duct passes through the opening in the diaphragm which transmits the aorta, ascends in front of the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae, at first to the right of the aorta, and

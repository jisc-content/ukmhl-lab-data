ANATOMY. 786 The convoluted tubes and Bowman’s capsules occur only in the cortex of the kidney; and they, with their contents, are the characteristic structures seen in it ■ on microscopic examination. Strictly speaking. Bowman’s capsule is the dilated commencement of a urinary tubule, which possesses the long and complicated course described as the con- voluted, looped, intermediary and straight tubules, before it opens on the surface of the papilla at the ductus papil- laris. The cortex of the kidney contains many thousands of Bowman’s capsules. The intermediary tubes are also found only in the cortex. The looped and straight tubes occur both in the cortex and in the medullary pyramids. The diameter of the several kinds of tubes is not uniform. The straight tubes within the papilla are from -g-^th to ^jig-th of an inch, that of their branches -g-^th, which is also about the diameter of the convoluted tubes. The looped tubes are considerably smaller, and the limb, which descends from the intermediary tube into the medullary pyramid, is wider than that which ascends from the pyra- mid to the convoluted tube. Bowman’s capsules vary in diameter from xi-g-th to each. The wall of each tube is formed of a delicate membrane, or tunica propria. Generally speaking, the membrane is extremely thin and homogenous, with occasional nuclei, but Frey states that in the looped and con pointed tubes it is thicker than in the straight tubes; and in the ductus papillaris, the tunica propria is said to be absent. The tubes are lined by an epithelium, which varies in its character in different localities. In the ductus papillaris the epithelium consists of low columns. In the straight tubes it is much more distinctly columnar. In the inter-

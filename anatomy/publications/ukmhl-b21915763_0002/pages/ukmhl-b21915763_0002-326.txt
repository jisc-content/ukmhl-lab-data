ANATOMY. 70(-. vessel, and a wrinkled or puckered condition of tke villns, sometimes seen after death, is occasioned. The villus also contains blood-vessels ; a small artery enters at its attached base, and terminates in a capillary plexus, situated in the peripheral part of the matrix, close to the cap of epi- thelium ; from the plexus a vein arises, which leaves the villns at its base, and joins the veins in the sub mucous coat. Various theories have been put forward to account for the mode of passage of the chyle, during digestion, from the lumen of the intestine into the lacteal vessels of the villi; but the question cannot even yet be regarded as definitely settled. The appearance of a network of minute tubules within the matrix, extending from the epithelial investment to the lacteal, which Letzerich supposed to be the channels along which the chyle flowed, is doubtless produced by the arrangement of the strands of the retiform tissue. There seems little doubt, that both the cells of the epithelial investment, and those of the retiform tissue of the matrix, become distended with the particles of chyle previous to its passage into the lacteal. The view advanced by Schafer, that the corpuscles in the meshes of the reti- form tissue may serve as carriers of the fatty particles of the chyle into the lacteals, is but another mode of expressing the function of these cells advocated thirty years ago by Goodsir. The mucous membrane of the small intestine is abun- dantly provided with secreting glands, named the glands of Brunner and of Lieberkiihn. Brunnerâ€™s glands are conflned to the duodenum; they belong to the compound racemose group of glands, and

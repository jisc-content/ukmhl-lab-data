682 ANATOMY. those which go to the liver between the two layers of the gastro-hepatic omentum. The vessels and nerves of the jejunum and ileum are between the anterior and posterior layers of the mesentery, and those of the transverse colon, sigmoid flexure, and rectum, between their respective mesenteric folds. Between the layers of the omenta, and those of the mesenteric folds, fatty tissue is developed, often in considerable abundance. The general cavity of the peritoneum consists of two compartments, which communicate with each other through a constricted passage, the so-called Joramen of Winslow. The larger of these compartments, or greater cavity of the peritoneum, is opened, when the anterior abdominal wall, and the parietal layer of peritoneum, which lines it, are cut through. It extends from the diaphragm above to the pelvis below, is in front of the stomach, great omentum, and intestine, and is the best known of the peritoneal compartmentSi The smaller compartment or lesser cavity of the peritoneum, lies behind the gastro-hepatic omentum and the stomach, and is prolonged downwards between the descending and the ascending layers of the great omentum as the sac of the omentum. Its posterior boundary is formed by the layer of peritoneum, which ascends in front of the pancreas to the diaphragm, to become continuous with the posterior layer of the coronary and the left lateral ligaments of the liver. It is closed in below by the omentum, trans- verse colon, and transverse meso-colon, and above by the liver, diaphragm, and coronary ligament. It is walled in on the left by the spleen and gnstro-splenic omentum, whilst on the right it communicatss with the greater cavity of the peritoneum through the foramen of Winslow.

511 CRANIAL BLOOD SINUSES. dura mater immediately adjacent to each sinus. They are without valves j but the superior longitudinal sinus has an irregular inner surface, owing to the projection of fibrous bands into its lumen. The Veins of the Brain ramify in the pia mater, and are arranged in a superficial and a deep group :— The superficial veins of the cerebrum pass out of the convolutions into the pia mater covering the outer surface Fig. 138.—Dura mater and Cranial Sinuses. 1, Falx cerebri; 2, tentorium ; 3, 3, superior longitudinal sinus; 4, lateral sinus; 6, internal jugular vein; 6, occi- pital sinus; 6', torcular Herophili; 7, inferior longitudinal sinus; 8, veins of Galen; 9 and 10, superior and inferior petrosal sinuses; 11, cavernous sinus; 12, circuiar sinus, which connects the two cavenious sinuses together; 13, ophthal- mic vein from 16, the eyeball; 14, crista gaUi of ethmoid bone. and the inner face of the cerebral hemispheres, and open into the superior longitudinal sinus, though some of the veins of the inner face open into the inferior longitudinal sinus. The veins from the convolutions on the lateral and under surfaces of the cerebrum open into the cavernous,

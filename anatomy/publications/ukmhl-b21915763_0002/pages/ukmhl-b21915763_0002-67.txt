.447 ULNAR ARTERY. carpi radialis, palmaris longus, and flexor sublimis digitorum muscles, and then descends, covered only by the skin and fasciae, close to the radial border of the flexor carpi ulnaris, as far as the radial side of the pisiform bone, when it passes under cover of the palmaris brevis muscle and the palmar fascia and forms the superficial palmar arch. It rests when in the fore arm for a short distance on the brachialis anticus, and then on the flexor profundus digitorum; at the wrist it lies on the anterior annular ligament; in the hand on the flexor tendons of the fingers, and the branches of the median and ulnar nerves. It is accompanied by the deep ulnar veins. The median nerve is separated from the commencement of the artery by the deep head of origin of the pronator teres. About the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the fore arm the ulnar nerve comes into relation with the artery, and passes along with it to the hand, the nerve being close to the inner side of the artery. The ulnar artery in the fore arm gives origin to the following branches;â€” a. Anterior Ulnar Recurrent arises close to the origin of the ulnar, and ascends in front of the brachialis anticus to anastomose with the anastomotic artery. h. Posterior Ulnar Recurrent arises close to the anterior, and passes upwards, and backwards to the interval between the inner condyle and olecranon. It and the anterior recurrent supply the muscles in front, and to the inner side of the elbow joint. c. Interosseus is the largest branch of the ulnar, and arises high in the fore arm; after a course of about an inch it divides into the anterior and posterior interosseous branches. The anterior interosseous artery passes down the

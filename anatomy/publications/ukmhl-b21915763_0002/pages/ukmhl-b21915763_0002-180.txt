ANATOMY. 560 work for the blood-corpuscles and the lymphoid corpuscles of the spleen pulp. The colourless lymphoid corpuscles have distinct nuclei, relatively large to the size of the cells, and with them are a few cells, also with distinct nuclei, but with a larger proportion of protoplasm, and somewhat polygonal in shape. In addition to the red blood cor- puscles possessing the normal appearance, shrivelled red corpuscles and pigment granules are also seen, together with large cells containing several red corpuscles or pigment granules. Frey supposes that these large cells are colourless corpuscles, which have taken into their interior either entire red corpuscles, or portions of their substance, which present the appearance of clumps of yellow pigment. Owing to the elasticity of the fibrous coat and trabecles of the spleen, and the free communi- cation of the blood-vessels with these interstices, they at times become engorged with blood ; if the splenic artery be artificially injected, they are easily distended by the injection. The splenic artery is the largest branch of the coeHac axis, and is large in relation to the size of the spleen. It divides into five or six branches before entering the hilus. After it has passed into the spleen it continues to divide and subdivide, branching dichotomously, without any anastomoses between its branches. When traced down to its finest ramifications it breaks up into clusters of branches or penicilli, which are usually compared in their arrangement to the hairs of a paint brush, though Frey regards them as more like the branches of a willow tree deprived of its leaves. The branches of the artery are enclosed in a sheath continuous at the hilus with the

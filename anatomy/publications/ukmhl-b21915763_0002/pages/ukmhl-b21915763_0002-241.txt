THE PLEUH^. 621 the surface of the diaphragm, to which the pericardium is attached, are not covered by the pleural membranes. The two pleural membranes are perfectly independent of each other, and although they both extend towards the mesial plane of the thorax, they do not come in contact with each other, except in some cases, where they touch immediately behind the body of the sternum. The in- terval between .the two pleural membranes occupies the mesial plane, or sterno-vertebral diameter of the thoracic cavity, and is named the mediastinum, mediastinal space, or interpleural space. The mediastinum is bounded late- rally, therefore, by the two pleurae; it is not an empty space, but is occupied by the heart and pericardium, and by certain structures situated both in front of and behind the pericardium. The heart and pericardium fill up the greater portion of the interpleural space, and the region they occupy is called the middle mediastinum. Owing to the projection of the heart to the left, the middle mediasti- num extends more to the left than to the right of the mesial plane. As the phrenic nerves lie between the sides of the pericardium and the mediastinal pleura, they are also placed in the middle mediastinum. The narrow interval between the front of the pericardium and the back of the sternum is the anterior mediastinum, which inclines from above downwards to the left of the mesial plane. It con- tains the left triangularis sterni muscle, the origins of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, in the infant and child the thymus gland, and in the adult the lobes of fat into which the gland has degenerated ; also some loose areolar tissue. The wider interval between the back of the pericardium and the front of the bodies of the vertebraj

571 SUPRA.-RENAL GLANDS. groups of rouudish or ovoid nucleated cells. The middle layer, or zona fasciculata, is relatively thick, and its connec- tive tissue is arranged in longitudinal meshes, perpendicular to the surface of the gland; the spaces or alveoli of the meshwork are elongated, and occupied by groups of poly- hedral cells, arrangeddn parallel columns, so that this layer presents a striated appearance. The inner layer, or zona reticularis, is thin, and its connective tissue forms a small meshed network occupied by groups of polyhedral cells. The cells of the several layers of the cortex are distinctly nu- cleated ; the protoplasm is coarsely granular, and in those of the inner layer contains pigment granules; sometimes delicate protoplasm processes jut out from the periphery of the cells. In all the layers the spaces of the meshwork, occupied by the groups of cells, are traversed by a very fine reticulum of connective tissue, which separates the indi- vidual cells in each group from each other. The medullary part is so soft as to be easily broken down. It is separated from the cortical part by connective tissue, and is traversed by a trabecular stroma of connec- tive tissue, which forms a network, in the meshes of which the medulla cells are lodged. These cells are polyhedral in form, with a clear nucleus, and finely granular protoplasm, free from fat and pigment. Delicate processes not un- frequently jut out from the periphery of ^the cells, and give them a stellate form. Henle showed that they are stained deep brown by chromic acid, or bichromate of potash, which is not the case with the cortical cells. The supra-renal glands are supplied with blood by the capsular branches of the aorta, and by the capsular branches of the phrenic and renal arteries. They pierce

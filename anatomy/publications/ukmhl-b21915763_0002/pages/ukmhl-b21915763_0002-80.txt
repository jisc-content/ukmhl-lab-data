â€¢460 ANATOMY, The Ophthalmic branch arises close to the anterior clinoid process, enters the orbit, along with the optic nerve, through the optic foramen and runs forwards and inwards above the optic nerve to end in branches to the nose and forehead. It gives origin to the following branches: lachrymal, which runs forwards in relation to the outer side of the roof of the orbit, and supplies the lachrymal gland, conjunctiva, and eyelids: arteria centralis retince, which passes into the optic nerve, enters the eyebaD along with it, and supplies the retina : ciliary branches, which accompany the optic nerve and pierce the sclerotic coat to ramify in the choroid coat, ciliary processes, and iris: muscular branches to the muscles ; anterior and poderior ethmoidal branches, which pass through the ethmoidal foramina, and supply the adjacent part of the dura mater; palpebral branches to the two eye-lids : nasal branch to the root of the nose : supra-oc'bital branch, which passes through the sujjra-orbital notch to the skin and muscles of the forehead : and a frontal branch, which is distributed to I the forehead, internal to the supra-orbital. The branches of the internal carotid for the supply of the brain are the middle and anterior cerebral and the IDOsterior communicating. Tlie Middle Cerebral artery extends outwards into the Sylvian fissure, divides into branches in the pia mater, and supplies the island of Eeil, the orbital convolutions, the inferior and ascending frontal convolutions, and the convolutions of the parietal and temporo-spheuoidal lobes : it also gives perforating branches through the locus perfo- ratus anticus to the corpus striatum, and sends a choroid branch to the choroid plexus of the velum interpositilm

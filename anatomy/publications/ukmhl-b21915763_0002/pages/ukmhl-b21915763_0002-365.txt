The Teeth are calcified organs developed in connection with the mucous membrane of the mouth. Their primary use is that of biting and grinding the food; but in man they serve as aids to speech, and in many animals act as instruments of ofiFence and defence. Arrangement and Form of the Teeth. Teeth are present in the greater number of the mam- malia, in which class they are implanted in sockets in the alveolar arches of the bones of the upper and lower jaws, and form only a single row in each arch. In a few mammals, as the toothed whales and the sloths, only one generation of teeth is produced, and when these drop out, they are not replaced by successors; these animals are called Monophyodont. In the majority of the mam- malia, however, there are two generations of teeth; a temporary or milk set, which are deciduous, and are replaced by a permanent or adult set; these animals are called Diphyodont. But in speaking of two generations of teeth it is not to be supposed that all the teeth in the adult jaw have had temporary predecessors, for the molar or back teeth have only a single generation. A few mammals, as the toothed whales, havejthe teeth uniform in size, shape, and structure, and are named Homodont ,â€¢ 3 B

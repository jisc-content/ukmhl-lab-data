451 RADIAL ARTERY. ' M. To elbow joint: anterior and posterior ulnar recur- rent, posterior interosseous recurrent artery. 4dh. To wrist joint: anterior and posterior ulnar carpal. bth. To muscles of hand : deep ulnar artery. Qth. To digits : the four digital arteries. The Kadial artery extends down the radial side of the front of the fore arm, turns round the outer side of the wrist, below the styloid process of the radius, to the back of the hand â€¢, then passes between the first and second metacarpal bones to the palm, across which it runs as far as the fourth metacarpal bone, where it joins the deep branch of the ulnar, and forms the deep palmar arterial ARCH. In the fore arm the radial artery is placed so near the surface that it is covered only by the skin and fasciae, though in muscular arms the supinator longus overlaps it. It lies on or over the radial tendon of the biceps, the supinator brevis, pronator teres, radial origin of the flexor sublimis, flexor poUicis longus, and pronator quadratus muscles, and on the lower end of the radius. To its outer side is the supinator longus; to its inner side the pronator teres in the upper, and the flexor carpi radialis in the lower part of its course; as it lies between the tendons of the supinator longus and flexor carpi radialis, its pulsa- tions can be readily felt in the living body. It is accom- panied by the deep radial veins, and the radial nerve is close to its outer side in the middle third of the fore arm. At the wrist and back of the hand the radial artery is crossed by the three extensor tendons of the thumb, and rests on the external lateral ligament of the wrist and the back of the carpus. As it enters the palm it goes between the two heads of

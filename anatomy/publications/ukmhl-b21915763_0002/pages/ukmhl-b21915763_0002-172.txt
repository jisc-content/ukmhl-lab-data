The trabecles are arranged in a cylindriform manner, and enclose alveoli, which contain lymph follicles that possess a cylindrical form. Here also, as in the cortex, the lymphoid tissue of the follicles within adjacent Fig. 152.—Semi-dingrammatic view of the medullary part and the hilus of a J.ympliatic Gland. As, stroma of hilus; ve, vas efferens; a, artery ending in capillaries; c, capsule; trabeculaj; lymph passage;/, follicles, highly magnified. filveoli is continuous through gaps in the intervening trabecular wall. The medullary lymph follicles are sur- rounded by lymph passages, continuous, on the one hand, with the lymph passages in the cortical part of the gland, and on the other, with the vasa efferentia, with which the medullary substance comes iuto direct relation at the hilus. The medullary lymph passages can be injected from the vasa efferentia. The surfaces of the trabeculm W’hich bound the lymph passages both in the cortex and medulla are covered by a layer of endothelial cells con-

550 ANATOMY. Each lymphatic gland is surrounded by a capsule, which consists of intei'lacing bundles of connective tissue intermingled with non-striped muscular fibres, which in some animals, as the ox, are very numerous. When a section is made through a gland it is seen- to consist of an external, yellowish-red, rtical part, and of a central, more deeply red, medullary part, which, however, reaches the surface at the hdus. From' the capsule thin laminae pass into Fig. 150.—Cluster of [Lymphatic Glands of .-i on'Kofonoo the sroin, between some of which fusion ^ae COlTlCul, SUDStauce has taken place, va, vasa afferentia ve, , c • ‘i. vasa efferentla; a, a, small arteries, and. lorm in It a Natural size . i i i trabecular framework, which divides the cortex into a number of compartments or alveoli. These alveoU contain rounded nodules, consisting of the proper glandular or follicular tissue of the lymphatic gland, which is arranged therefore as a number of follicles, called the follicles of the cortex. As the trabeculae do not form perfect partitions between adjacent follicles, the tissue of one follicle is to some extent continuous vath that of those which lie around it. These follicles are formed of lymphoid tissue, resembling in structure the lymj^hoid follicles already

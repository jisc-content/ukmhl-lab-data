UEINARY BLADDEE. 79a of the calyx, but the circular fibres have been described by Henle as forming a circular muscle around the papilla, where the mucous membrane is refiected on it. The coats of the ureter receive blood through small, branches of the renal, spermatic, and inferior vesical arte- ries. Nerves from the spermatic and hypogastric plexuses also pass to them. URINARY BLADDER. The Urinary Bladder is the reservoir in which the urine collects prior to being expelled along the urethra. It. varies in size, shape, and consequently in position, with the amount of urine it contains. When quite empty it lies in the cavity of the pelvis, behind and above the pubic bones and symphysis. When moderately full it rises slightly above the pubic symphysis into the hypogastrium, and, as its distension increases, it ascends still higher into this region. The empty bladder is flattened in form; when moderately full it is rounded; when much distended it is ovoid, and its longest axis is directed from above, downwards and backwards. The following parts may be recognized in a weU-dis- tended bladder, a base, an apex, an anterior a posterior and two lateral surfaces, and a cervix or neck. Its base or fundus is directed backwards towards the second part of the rectum, from which it is separated, in the male, by the vesiculse seminales, and the recto-vesical layer of the pelvic fascia. Its a'pex is directed forwards to the h)q)ogastrium, and from it a fibrous cord, the obliterated urachus, proceeds towards, and often as far as the navel. The 3 E

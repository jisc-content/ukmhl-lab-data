ANATOMY. 432 wall of the abdomen, and the ilio-lumbar branch of the internal iliac artery in the iliac fossa. These inosculate with the branches of three arteries which run from before backwards in the same parietes. Thus the internal mam- mary branch of the subclavian artery descends behind the cartilages of the ribs, and gives off the anterior inter- costal branches, which run outwards to join the superior intercostal and aortic intercostals in the thoracic wall; also the musculo-phrenic branch which inosculates in the diaphragm with the aortic intercostals and the phrenic branches of the aorta; whilst the internal mammary ter- minates in the anterior wall of the abdomen by inosculating with the deep epigastric artery. From the external iliac artery arise two branchesâ€”the deep epigastric and deep circumflex iliac. The deep epigastric ascends behind the rectus abdominis, inosculates with the superior epigastric of the internal mammary, and with the lower intercostal and lumbar branches of the aorta. The deep circumflex iliac runs outwards along the line of the iliac crest, and inosculates with the lumbar arteries and the ilio-lumbar of the internal iliac. In the region of the pelvis the trans- verse branches of the middle sacral artery inosculate with the lateral sacral branches of the internal iliac. The statement has frequently been made that the visceral and parietal branches of the aorta do not anastomose unth each other, but injections which I made some years ago proved that, both in the thoracic and abdominal cavities, slender anastomosing communications exist between the two sets of branches. In the abdominal cavity a wide meshed plexus of small arteries, which I have named the sub- or extra-pentoneal plexus, lies in the fat outside the

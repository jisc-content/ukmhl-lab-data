850 ANATOMY. At the orifice of the urethra are some slight folds of the mucous membrane. The Nymphce, or labia minora, are two muco-tegumentary folds, which lie one on each side of the vaginal orifice, and form the lateral walls of the vestibule. When they are removed the bulbo-cavernosus muscle is exposed, and situated partially under cover of each half of this muscle is a highly vascular structure, the Bulb of the vestibule. The vestibular bulb is about one inch long, and consists of a complicated venous erectile network, the veins from which communicate with the vaginal plexus of veins and with the veins of the clitoris. A smaller venous plexus in front of the bulb has been named by Kobelt the pars intermedia. The two vestibular bulbs represent, in the female, the two halves of the erectile part of the bulb in the corpus spongiosum penis. The muco-tegumentary surface of the nymphse is covered by a squamous and stratified epithelium, and opening on its surface are the ducts of numerous small mucous glands. Two glands, named the Glands of Bartholini, o?’ Duverney, or the vulvo-vaginal glands, open each by a long duct into the vestibule close to the orifice of the vagina. These glands vary in size from a pea to a small almond, and lie between the transversi perinei muscles aud the posterior end of the bulbus vestibuli. They are homologous with Cowper’s glands in the male, and like them possess the compound racemose type of structure. At the anterior part of the vestibule is situated the Clitoris, a structure about 1^ inch long, which represents in the female the penis of the male, but has no urethra enclosed in it. It is attached to the sides of the pubic arch by two crura, which become the coiqmra cavernosa

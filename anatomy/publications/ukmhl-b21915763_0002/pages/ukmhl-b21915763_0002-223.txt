VESSELS AND NERVES OF LARYNX. 603 Vessels and Nerves of the Larynx. Tte larynx receives its supply of blood from the-superior laryngeal branches of the superior thyroid arteries, which pierce the thyro-hyoid membrane; from the crico-thyroid branches of the same arteries, which form an arch on the crico-thyroid membrane, and from the inferior laryngeal branches of the inferior thyroid arteries, which pass to the lower and posterior part of the larynx. Veins correspond to these different arteries. Lymphatics are distributed in the mucous and submucous tissues. The nerves of the larynx are the superior and inferior laryngeal branches of the pneumogastric. The superior laryngeal nerve divides into an external and an internal branch. The external branch is small, and descends to sup- ply the crico-thyroid muscle. The internal branch pierces the thyro-hyoid membrane, and divides into two parts; the upper or epiglottic branch supplies the mucous covering of the epiglottis, the aryteno-epiglottidean and hyo-glossal folds of mucous membrane; the lower part supplies the mucous lining of the middle and lower parts of the larynx, and gives a branch to the arytenoid muscle. The inferior or recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies branches to all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx except the crico-thyroid. It also communicates with the superior laryngeal nerve, and gives some small twigs to the mucous membrane.

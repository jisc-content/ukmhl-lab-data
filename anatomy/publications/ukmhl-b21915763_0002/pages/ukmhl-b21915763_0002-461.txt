UTEEUS. sn peritoneum. The interval between the uterus and the bladder, bounded laterally by the utero-vesical folds is the utero-vesical pouch of, the peritoneum, whilst the interval between the uterus and rectum, bounded laterally by the utero-rectal folds, is the utero^ectal pouch, or pouch of Douglas. Both the utero-vesical and utero-rectal folds of peritoneum contain fasciculi of non-striped muscle, con- tinuous with the muscular coat of the uterus. Those in the utero-rectal folds are most distinct, and extend back" wards to the rectum in the region of the second sacral vertebra. Luschka conceives that they can draw the uterus backwards, and has named the arrangement the muscvlus retractor uteri. The broad ligaments of the uterus are expanded folds of the peritoneum, which not only serve as lateral liga- ments for the organ, but enclose the Fallopian tubes, the ovarian, and round ligaments, the par-ovarium and the vessels and nerves of the uterus and ovaries. The ovaries also are attached by their anterior borders to the posterior surface of the broad ligaments. The round ligament, or ligamentum teres, is a round cord about five inches long, attached to the upper angle of the uterus, below and in front of the Fallopian tube. It passes forwards and outwards to reach the internal or deep abdominal ring; it then enters the inguinal canal, along which it passes, and leaves it at the external or superficial abdominal ring to end by becoming continuous with the subcutaneous tissue of the pubic region. The round ligament is chiefly composed of non-striped muscular fibres continuous with the muscular wall of the uterus, and some of these fibres spread out between the layers of the 3 H

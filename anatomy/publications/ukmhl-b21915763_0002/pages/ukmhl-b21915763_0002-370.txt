ANATOMY. 750 two posterior cusps; in the second lower molar the fifth cusp is usually absent, or only rudimentary in size, but in the lower wisdom tooth it is often present. The fangs of the first and second upper molars are three in number, and divergent; two on the outer or buccal side, one on the inner or palatal side; in the upper wisdom the fangs are frequently partially conjoined, though trifid at the point. The fangs of the first and second lower molars are two in number, an anterior and a posterior, of which the anterior is the larger; they usually curve backwards in the jaw; in the lower wisdom the fangs are usually conjoined, but bifid at the point. The crowns of all the teeth bpcome more or less flat- tened by use, so that the incisors lose their sharp cutting edge, and the cusps of the premolars and molars are worn away. The temporary or milk teeth are smaller than the per- manent teeth. They are more constricted at the neck, where the crown joins the fang, especially in the milk molars, the fangs of which alsa diverge more widely than in the permanent set. The second temporary molar is bigger than the first. The crown of the first upper molar has three cusps, two buccal, one palatal: that of the second four cusps. The crown of the first lower molar has four cusps j that of the second five, three of which are buccal, two lingual. The temporary teeth lie more vertically in the jaws than the permanent. The alveolus, or socket for the lodgment of the single fanged teeth, is a single socket; in the multi-fanged teeth, the socket is divided into two or three compartments, accord- ing to the number of fangs. The socket is lined by the

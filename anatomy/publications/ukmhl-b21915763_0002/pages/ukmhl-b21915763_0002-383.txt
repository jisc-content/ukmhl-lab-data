TEETH. 763 increases in quantity, apparently by a proliferation of its cells; nerve fibres are developed in it; it does not undergo calcification, and persists as tbe pulp of the tooth. The papilla of the tooth has essentially, therefore, the same Flo. 212.â€”Section through the dmtlne an 1 pulp cavity of a young tooth, p, the pulp, with V, one of its.vessels, and o, layers of odonio-blast cells giving off pro- cesses into d, the dentine.

In both in- stances the hard matrix is due to a special differentiation of the protoplasm of the formative cells; the dentinal fibrils are the equivalent structures to the soft contents of the lacunae and canaliculi, and the persistent pulp is equivalent to the cellulo-vascular contents of the Haversian canals. Prior to the embryo tooth becoming sacculated, changes had taken place in the enamel organ. Those cells of the enamel organ, v?hich lie next the dental papilla, are con- tinuous through the neck of the enamel organ, with the deepest layer of cells of the oral epithelium, which cells are elongated columns set perpendicularly to the surface on which they rest. Similarly the cells of the deepest

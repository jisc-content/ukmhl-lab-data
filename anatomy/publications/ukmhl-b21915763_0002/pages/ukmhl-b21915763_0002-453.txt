OVABY. 833 it penetrates between and aronnd the spherical cor- puscles, and separates them from the columnar corpuscles on the outer surface and in the involuted germ epithe- lium. Collections of these spherical cells then become enclosed in the substance of the stroma of the ovary, and form the egg-chains and egg-clusters described by Pfliiger and Waldeyer. As the examination of the developing ovary is made by means of vertical sections into its substance, the egg-chains appear as if enclosed in tubes, and have led to Fig. 229.—Vertical section throngh the Ovaiy of the Human foetus, g, g, germ epithelium, with o, o, developing ova in it; s, s, ovarian stroma, containing c, c, c, fusiform connective tissue corpuscles ; v, v, capillary hlood-vessels. In the centre of the flgiu-e an involution of the germ epithelium is shown; and at the left lower side a primordial ovum, witii the connective tissue corpuscles ranging themselves round it.—^After Foulis. the impression that the ovary was a tubular gland. But, from Fouhs’s observations, it would appear that these so- called tubes are produced by sections through furrows and depressions between irregular prominences on the surface of the ovary, which prominences are owing to the ex- pansion of egg-clusters situated under the germ epithe-

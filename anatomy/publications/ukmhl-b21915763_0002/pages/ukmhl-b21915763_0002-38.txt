418 ANATOMY, iu front, and the sixth dorsal vertebra behind. It passes behind the sternum obliquely upwards and to the right, as the ascending aorta, or ascending part of the arch, to the level of the second right costal cartilage. It then changes its direction, and passes from right to left and from before backwards as the transverse part of the arch of the aorta. It is often stated that the transverse part of the arch reaches the left side of the spine on a level with and close to the left of the body of the seeond dorsal vertebra, but John Wood has pointed out that it approaches the spine at the lower border of the left side of the body of the fourth dorsal vertebra, and first touches the spine at the disc.between the fourth and fifth dorsal'vertebrae. Here it again changes its direction and runs vertically down- wards, as the descending part of the arch, in close contact with the left side of the body of the fifth dorsal vertebra as far as its lower border, when it becomes the descending thoracic aorta. The ascending aorta is enclosed within the bag of the pericardium, and has at its origin the three semilunar valves with the sinuses of Valsalva. The pulmonary arterial trunk is at first in front of and then to its left side; the right auricular appendage and superior cava are to its right side, and the structures going to the root of the right lung lie behind it. The transverse part of the arch lies behind the sternum, left pleura, and left lung, and is crossed by the left phrenic, pneumogastric, and superficial cardiac nerves. It is placed in front of the trachea, oesophagus, and thoracic duct, and the left recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks round its lower surface and behind it. Its lower surface is in relation to

ANATOMY, 472 iliac arteries. Each, common iliac lies behind the perito- neum covering the posterior wall of the abdomen, and is overlapped by the small intestine. Each is crossed by the ureter and the branches of the sympathetic cord to the hypogastric plexus, and the left in addition by the inferior mesenteric vessels. Each is in front of the bodies of the two lower lumbar vertebrae, but the two common iliac veins are interposed between the right artery and the last lumbar vertebra, whilst the left common iliac vein lies below its corresponding artery, No collateral branches arise from the common iliac. The External Iliac artery is the commencement of the great arterial trunk for the lower limb; it is the larger of the two branches of bifurcation of the common iHac, and passes downwards and outwards within the cavity of the abdomen as far as Poupart’s ligament, where it becomes the femoral artery. It lies behind the peritoneum cover- ing the posterior wall of the abdomen, and is over- lapped by the intestines. It rests on the fascia covering the inner border of the psoas muscle close to the j>elvic inlet. The external iliac vein lies behind the upper end of the artery, but on the same plane and internal to its lower end, where it receives the deep circumflex iliac vein, which crosses in front of the artery. The genito- crural nerve is at first external and then anterior to it; lymphatic glands and vessels run close to its anterior and inner aspects. Its only branches are distributed to the muscles of the abdominal wall, and are as follows :— a. Deep Epigastric artery arises just above Poupart’s ligament and ascends, immediately to the inner side of the internal or deep abdominal ring, to the anterior wall of the

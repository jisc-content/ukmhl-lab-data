ANATOMY. 834 liutn. Waldeyer believed that of the cells in the imbedded ' egg-clusters, some developed into ova, whilst others greatly- multiplied in numbers and formed the cells of the mem- brana granulosa, whilst the surrounding vascular stroma formed the wall of the Graafian follicle. Hence he regarded both the ova and the follicular epithelium as derived from the germ epithelium. The researches of J. Foulis have led to a modification of this opinion. The primordial ova undoubtedly arise from imbedded spherical cells of the germ epithelium. But Foulis has traced delicate processes of the connective tissue stroma, with its charac- teristic fusiform corpuscles, penetrating between the indi- vidual cells of the egg-clusters, so as to separate these cells from each other, and to give to each cell a special envelope of stroma tissue. The connective tissue corpuscles of the stroma are closely applied to the peripheral part of the yelk protoplasm of the primordial ovum, so as to dimple its surface. The vascular stroma surrounding each pri- mordial ovum then forms the wall of the Graafian foUicle, whilst the fusiform connective tissue corpuscles rapidly proliferate into the cells of the membrana granulosa, which originally form only a single layer. According to this view, therefore, whilst the ova are specially modified germ epithelium cells, the cells lining the Graafian follicle are derived from the corpuscles of the connective tissue stroma. With the increase in the number of the cells of the membrana granulosa they become arranged in several layers, and the discus proligerus is produced; as the expansion of the follicle goes on, the liquor folliculi is secreted. The cells of the membrana granulosa have a diameter of about ^o^ooth inch.

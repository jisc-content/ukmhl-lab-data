LYMPHATIC GLANDS, 551 described, and tbe mesbes of the reticulum are crowded with lymph corpuscles. Surrounding each of the follicles, and bounded by the trabeculae, is a space traversed by a reticulum of the retiform connective tissue, the stellate Fig. 151.—Semi-diaffraimnatic view of thc’stmctuve of the eortex of a Lymphatic Gland, c, capsule; t, t, tiabecuiiE; p, lymph passage with retifoim tissue; /, lymph foUicle; v a, vas afferens communicating with lymph passages; a, arte- ries and hlood capillaries. Highly magnified. cells of which are continuous on the one hand with the retiform tissue of the follicle, and on the other with the tra- becular framework of the cortex. This space contains lymph corpuscles, which are easily washed out, and it obviously resembles the lymph spaces or passages which invest the bases of the follicles of a Peyer’s patch. It communicates with the vasa afferentia, from which it can be injected. Owing to the continuity between the tissue of adjacent follicles, their surrounding lymph spaces are also continuous with each other, and form an anastomosing set of lymph passages within the cortex of the gland. The medullary part of the lymphatic 'gland is also

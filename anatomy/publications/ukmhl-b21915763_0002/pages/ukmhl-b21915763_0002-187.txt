THYROID GLAND. 567 tissue of the follicles has not been traced. They leave the thymus along with the blood-vessels, and join the lym- phatic glands in the anterior mediastinum. Fine nerves pass to the thymus along with the arteries, and offsets of the cardiac plexus are said to enter it. The lymphoid tissue of the thymus gland may serve as the centre of production of the large lymphoid intra- thoracic tumours, sometimes developed in the anterior mediastinum. THYROID GLAISTD. The Thyroid Gland, or Thyroid Body, is a very vascular organ, of a reddish-brown colour, situated in the anterior part of the neck, in close relation to the sides and front of the windpipe. It consists of two lateral lobes united together by an intermediate median lobe or isthmus. Each lateral lohe is about two inches long, one inch wide, and three-quarters of an inch in thickness. The lateral lobe lies in close relation to the side of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, and extends as far down as the fifth or sixth ring of the trachea; and it is connected to the laryngeal and tracheal cartilages by areolar tissue. The median lohe or isthmus varies in its vertical diameter from -j- to J inch ; it passes transversely across the front of the trachea opposite its third and fourth rings, and connects together the lower ends of the two lateral lobes. The thyroid gland is covered by the sterno-hyoid, sterno- thyroid, and omo-hyoid muscles, and its posterior border comes into relation with the common carotid artery.

728 ANATOMY. whilst the posterior part contains a slender fibrous cord formed by the obliteration of a vein of the foetus, named ductus venosus. The longitudinal fissure is often bridged across by a band of liver substance called pons hcpatis. The under surface of the left lobe is smooth, and overlaps the anterior surface of the stomach. The under surface of Fig. 197,—Under surface of the Liver.

Starting from about the middle of the longitudinal fissure is the portal or transverse fissure, which extends foi from three to four inches across the under surface of the right lobe. It is the gate {porta) of the liver, the htlus or fissure of entrance into the organ of the portal vein,

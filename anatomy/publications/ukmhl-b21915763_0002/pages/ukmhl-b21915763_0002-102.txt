482 ANATOMY. d. Do'/jalis Hallucis arises as the artery dips into the first metatarsal space, and runs along the dorsal surface of the great toe. e. First Digital branch arises in the sole and runs along the inner border of the plantar surface of the great toe. f. Second Digital branch also arises in the sole, and dividing into two, supplies the adjacent sides of the great and second toes. The PosTEKioE Tibial artery is the larger of the two terminal branches of the popliteal, and continues the course of that artery down the back of the leg as far as the inner ankle, where it divides into its two terminal branches, the internal and external plantar arteries. In the upper two-thirds of its course, it is placed deeply in the limb under cover of the great muscles of the calf, but in the lower third it lies to the inner side of the tendo Achillis, and is covered by the skin and fasciae; imme- diately prior to its termination, however, it passes under cover of the origin of the abductor haUucis. It rests from above downwards on the tibialis posticus, flexor longus digi- torum, the tibia, and ankle joint; at the inner ankle it has the tendons of the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digi- torum between it and the inner malleolus, and the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis to its outer or calcaneal side. It is accompanied by two venae comites. The posterior tibial nerve is at first to its inner side, and then crosses behind to descend on the outer side of the artery. Its branches are as follows :â€” a. Muscular branches to muscles of back of leg. h. Nutrient branch to shaft of tibia, c. Calcaneal branch to skin of heel.

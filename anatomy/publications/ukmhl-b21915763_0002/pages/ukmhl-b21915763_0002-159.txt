LYMPHATICS OF LOWER LIMB, 639 to the internal saphenous vein, named femoral glands, and a superior, . lying parallel to and immediately below Poupart’s ligament, named inguinal glands. The femoral glands receive the superficial lymph-vessels which ascend along the thigh. The inguinal glands receive the super- ficial lymph-vessels from the outside of the thigh, the anterior abdominal wall, and the organs of generation. From both sets of glands lymph-vessels proceed which perforate the fascia lata, at and near the saphenous open- ing, and join the deep lymphatics of the limb. The deep lymph-vessels of the lower limb ascend from the sole and dorsum of the foot, along with the anterior and posterior tibia! and the peroneal arteries. In the popliteal space they enter lymphatic glands situated in close relation to the popliteal artery. From these glands efiferent vessels emerge, and ascend along with the femoral artery to reach the deep lymphatic glands of the groin, where they are joined by the efferent vessels from the superficial glands. They then ascend on the inner side of the femoral vein, through the crural canal, or innermost compartment of the femoral sheath, enter the abdominal cavity, and become continuous with the deep lymph-vessels and glands which accompany the external iliac artery. Structure of the Lymphatic Yesseh, The lymphatic vessels consist of vessels that can be seen with the naked eye, and of lymph capillaries. The Larger Lymphatics have in many respects the structure of veins, and like them possess three coats. Th« outer coat consists of white fibrous tissue, interniinglea with elastic fibres, and a few bundles of non striped mus-

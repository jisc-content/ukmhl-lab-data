KIDNEY. 783 kidney, that of the sheep, and of mammals generally, the lobules become fused together into a single organ. To obtain a knowledge of the structure of the gland, it will be necessary to make longitudinal sections through the organ from the convex border to the hilus. When this is done, the ureter will be seen to enter the kidney at the hilus, and to dilate into a wide pelvis, which divides, either directly or indirectly, into several short, truncated Fig. 219.â€”a longitudinal section througli the kidney.

ANATOMY. 564 tliat leave the spleen at the hilus, along with the branches of the splenic artery. It seems now to have been established that the blood of the splenic artery flows into capillaries; but before it enters the veins, it has to traverse the interstices of the intervas- cular network of the spleen pulp, in which interstices quantities of lymphoid cells are situated, which cells are washed into the blood stream, and are conveyed into the splenic vein; so that the spleen pulp serves as a centre for the production of white blood corpuscles, and the blood of the splenic vein contains a larger proportion of white blood corpuscles than that of the splenic artery. The spleen, therefore, may be compared with a lymphatic gland, but with this difference, that while in the latter the stream which flows through the organ and collects the lymph corpuscles is lymph, in the former organ it is blood. The lymphatics of the spleen form a superflcial and a deep set. The superflcial lymphatics were injected by Alex. Monro, secundus, and form in the oxâ€™s spleen a network of large vessels with distinct valves. Deep lymphatics, continuous with the superficial set, ramify in the trabecular framework. According to Tomsa, deep lymphatics accompany the arteries, and probably form networks around the Malpighian corpuscles. It has also been surmised that they arise from the lymphoid tissue in the coat of the smaller arteries. Nerves from the solar plexus accompany the splenic artery and its branches throughout the substance of the spleen. Ganglion cells have been described on these nerves.

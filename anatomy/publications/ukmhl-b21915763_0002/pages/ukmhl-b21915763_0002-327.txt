SMALL INTESTINE. 707 mu resemble generally in structure the mucous and salivary glands. The minute lobules of these glands lie in the submucous coat, and the excretory duct pierces the mucous membrane to open on the surface. The wall of the duct is formed of connective tissue lined by columnar epithe- lium. The finest branches of the duct are continuous with the acini or gland vesicles, and W. Krause states that their membrana propria consists of a layer of polygonal fiattened cells. The gland vesicles contain the secreting cells, which are columnar in form; and Schwalbe has described in- ter-ceUular passages, between these cells which communi- cate, as in the salivary glands, with the excretory duct. A plexus of capillary blood- vessels is distributed outside the membrana propria of the gland vesicles, and lym- phatic vessels lie around the lobules. Into the duodenum, about the junction of its descending and horizontal portions, the duct of the pancreas, and the bQe duct from the liver, open by a com- mon orifice. These glands may be regarded therefore as accessory glands to this portion of the small intestine. Fig. 191.—Vei tical section through the wall of the duodenum, showing the Glands of Brunner.

500 ANATOMY, THE VEINS, The veins are the vessels which convey the blood from the capillaries back to the heart, and in their course in- crease in size, by junction or anastomosis with each other. The rootlets of the veins spring from a network of capil- lary vessels ; they communicate with each other and form a venous plexus, from which larger veins arise. The veins in the body are more numerous than the arteries, and possess collectively a greater capacity than the arteries. In most of the veins delicate valves are found, which possess a semilunar form, and are usually arranged in pairs, and a pouch-like dilatation of the waU of the vein is opposite each segment of the valve. When the blood flows along the veins towards the heart, the valves lie against the wall of the vessel; but if pressure be applied to a vein so as to obstruct the on- ward flow of the circulation, then the blood passes into the pouches between the wall of the vein and the valve adjacent to the seat of pressure, so as to force the seg- ments of the valve across the lumen of the vein and stop the regurgi- tation of the blood. The valves are found especially in the veins of the limbs, where the circulation is likely to be interfered with either Fio. 136.â€”A Vein cut open to pv the pressure of the muscles on sliow a pair of viJves.

755 TEETH. to decussate witli each other. The rods are marked by faint transverse lines: they are solid structures in the fuUy formed enamel, and are polygonal in form. When cut across transversely, they are seen to be hexagonal or pentagonal, and about 5 0^0diameter. Fissures are often seen extending into that surface of the enamel, which rests on the dentine j and I agree with Tomes’s statement, that dentine tubes may sometimes be seen to enter the deep surface of the enamel. The free surface of the enamel of an unworn tooth is covered by a thin membrane, named the cuticle of the enamel, or Nasmyth's membrane. This membrane can be demonstrated by digesting an unworn tooth in a dilute mineral acid, when it separates as a thin flake from the free surface of the crown. It is a horny membrane, which resists the action of acids. Waldeyer states that when treated with a solution of nitrate of silver, it presents the appearance of figures bke large epithelial cells. Its deep surface is pitted for the ends of the enamel rods. As the crown of the tooth comes into use, Nasmyth’s membrane is worn off, and the enamel itself by prolonged use is thinned and worn down. In persons who live on hard food, that requires much mastication, it is not uncommon to find the grinding surface of the crowns of the molar teeth worn down quite flat, and the dentine exposed. The Cement, Crusta petrosa, or Tooth hone, forms a thin covering for the surface of the fang of a tooth, and extends upwards to the neck. It is of a yellowish colour, and is usually thickest at the point of the fang; though in the multifanged teeth it sometimes forms a thickish mass at the point of convergence of the fangs. It possesses the

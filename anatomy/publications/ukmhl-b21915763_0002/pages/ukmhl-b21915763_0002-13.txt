CHAPTEE YII. VASCULAE SYSTEM. The human body and the bodies of all the more highly organized animals are traversed by a system of closed, branching tubes or pipes, technically called Vessels, some of which in man are nearly an inch in diameter, others so small as to require a microscope for their examination, others again of every intermediate size. In connection with the vessels is a central organ, the Heart. The heart and the vessels collectively constitute the Vascular System. When examined after death the vessels are frequently found to be empty, but during life they contain fluids. Some contain Blood, and form the Sanguiferous or Blood- vascular system; others contain Lymph, and form the Lymph-vascular system. The lymph-vascular system is not distinct from and independent of the blood-vascular system, but communicates with it at several points. The vascular system is a hydraulic apparatus, possessing a pump, pipes, and valves. The heart is the pump, which works, not by the movements of a piston, but by the con- traction of its muscular walls; the vessels are the pipes which convey the contained fluid, and tliey are provided in certain localities with valves for directing its flow. 2 C

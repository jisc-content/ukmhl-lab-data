475 FEMOKAL AETERY. inches above the opening in the tendon of the adductor magnus it lies in Hunter’s canal—a canal bounded exter- nally by the tendon of the vastus internus, posteriorly by the tendons of the adductor longus and magnus, and anteriorly by a fibrous prolongation from the tendon of the vastus to those of the two adductors. When in this canal the artery ia in close relation to the inner surface of the middle third of the femur. Close to the apex of Scarpa’s triangle it is in relation to the inner border of the sartorius muscle, which forms a definite guide to the position of the artery. Behind the artery is the psoas muscle, by which it is separated from the capsule of the hip joint and the head of the thigh bone; lower down the artery is ia front of the pectineus, but separated from it by the deep femoral vessels, and still lower the artery has the tendons of the adductor longus and magnus posterior to it. The femoral vein is at first on the same plane and internal to the artery, and is enclosed along with it and the femoral lymphatics in the femoral sheath ; about the apex of Scarpa’s triangle the vein sinks behind the artery, and remains posterior to it as far as the popliteal space. The long saphenous vein is superficial, and to the inner side of the artery, and separated from it by the fascia lata. The anterior crural nerve is to the outer side of the artery near the base of Scarpa’s triangle j of its several branches the internal cutaneous nerve crosses the artery near the apex of the triangle: the internal saphenous accompanies the artery into Hunter’s canal, but when the artery leaves the canal to enter the popliteal space, the nerve perforates its fibrous waU, and becomes cutaneous near the inner side of the knee joint. The branches of the femoral artery are as follows :—

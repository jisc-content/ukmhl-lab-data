516 ANATOMY. System of the Inferior Vena Cava. The Infeeior or Ascending Vena Cava collects aiid conveys to the right auricle of the heart the blood ■which circulates in the lower limbs, in the abdominal and pelvic walls and viscera. It is chiefly situated in the cavity of the abdomen, and is formed by the junction of the two common iliac veins on the right side of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra (fig. 140); it ascends to the right, close to the abdominal aorta, for some distance; when it reaches the under surface of the liver it lies in a fossa in that organ, and is separated from the aorta by the right crus of the diaphragm; it then pierces the tendon of the diaphragm and the fibrous layer of the pericardium, and opens into the lower and posterior part of the right auricle. Except the Eustachian valve at its auricular orifice, it is without valves. Several veins, corresponding to branches of the abdominal aorta, open directly into the inferior vena cava; as follows:— The Middle Sacral vein joins either the commence- ment of the cava, or the left common iliac vein. The Lumbar veins collect the blood from the posterior wall of the abdomen, and open into the posterior wall of- the inferior cava. As already described (pp. 503, 505), these veins also communicate with the azygos vein. The Spermatic veins ascend from the testicles, one in each spermatic cord, in which it forms a plexiform arrange- ment. At the internal or deep abdominal ring it runs upwards behind the peritoneum and opens on the right side into the inferior cava, on the left into the left renal vein.

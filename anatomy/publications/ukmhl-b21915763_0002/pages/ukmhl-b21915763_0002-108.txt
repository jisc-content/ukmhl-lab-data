ANATOMY. 488 branch to the ilium through the nutrient foramen in its ventral surface. /. Internal or Dee'p Pudic artery pierces the pelvic fascia, passes out of the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and appears in the buttock below the pyriformis muscle, where it lies on the spine of the ischium. It then goes through the small sacro-sciatic foramen, runs forwards along the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa, in close relation to the inner surface of the obturator internus muscle, and ensheathed by the obturator or parietal layer of the pelvic fascia; it continues its course forwards behind the triangular ligament of the urethra, and in close relation to the side of the pubic arch, then pierces the triangular ligament, and terminates by dividing into the dorsal artery of the penis and the artery for the corpus caverno- sum. It is accompanied by the deep pudic vein, and the pudic nerve. Its branchesjare as follows : inferior liceinorr- hoidal arises in the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa, passes through the fat in that fossa, and is distributed to the lower end of the rectum, the sphincter ani, and the skin around the anus : superficial perineal arises in the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa, and runs forwards to supply the fascia and skin of the scrotum : transverse peri- neal, a small branch to the structures between the anus and the bulb of the urethra: artery of the bulh, a short but important artery which arises behind the triangular liga- ment of the urethra, passes transversely or obliquely inwards, then pierces the ligament to enter the back of the bulb; sometimes the artery of the bulb arises nearer the ischio-rectal fossa, and runs very obliquely forwards in order to reach the bulb j were the lateral operation of

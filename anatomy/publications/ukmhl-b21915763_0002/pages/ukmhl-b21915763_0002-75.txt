455 INOSCULATIONS IN UPPER LIMB. brandies of the axillary. Around the elbow joint the three descending branches of the brachial artery, viz., the superior profunda, inferior profunda and anasto- motic, inosculate with the four ascending or recurrent arteries. Thus, at the outer and anterior part of the joint, the superior profunda anastomoses with the radial recur- rent, and at the outer and posterior the superior pro- funda with the posterior interosseous recurrent; at the inner and anterior part the anastomotic inosculates with the anterior ulnar recurrent, and at the inner and posterior the anastomotic and inferior profunda with the pos- terior ulnar recurrent. If the brachial artery were tied or occluded from any cause, these anastomoses would enlarge and convey the blood into the arteries of the fore arm. In the front of the fore arm the short muscular branches of the radial and ulnar arteries anastomose with each other, and with the anterior interosseous of the ulnar; and on the back of the fore arm, the posterior interosseous with the perforating branch of the anterior interosseous. Around the wrist joint not only are there the inosculations of the carpal arches, but the anterior carpal arch anastomoses with the anterior interosseous and the recurrent branches of the deep palmar arch; and the posterior carpal arch with the perforating branch of the anterior interosseous. In the hand the anastomoses are numerous ; not only does the ulnar artery itself join the volar and index branches of the radial artery to form the superficial palmar arch; and the radial artery itself join the deep branch of the ulnar to form the deep arch; but the palmar interosseous branches of the deep arch anastomose with the digital branches of the superficial arch; again the two digital

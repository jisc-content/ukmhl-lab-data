489 INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. lithotomy to be performed in such a case the artery would in all probability be cut through : artery of the corjjus cavernosum enters the crus penis, and is distributed in the erectile structure of the corpus cavernosum penis : dorsal artery of the penis pierces the suspensory liga- ment of the penis, runs forward in the subcutaneous fascia on the dorsum of the organ, sends branches into the corpus cavernosum, and ends in the glans penis and prepuce. â€˜In the female the internal pudic artery is much smaller than in the male, owing to the small size of the clitoris as compared with the penis. It gives off a similar set of branches, but the superficial perineal is distributed to the labium, the artery to the hulb supplies the bulbus vestibuli, and the terminal branches supply, the one the crus and corpus cavernosum of the clitoris, the other the dorsum and glans of the clitoris. g. Gluteal artery, the largest branch of the internal iliac, pierces the pelvic fascia, and passes out of the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen in close relation to its upper or iliac boundary, and appears in the buttock immediately above the pyriformis muscle, where it divides into a superficial and a deep branch. The superfi(^l branch runs between the gluteus medius and maximus, and enters the maximus to supply the upper portion of that muscle. The deep branch divides into two parts, one curves outwards along the border of attachment of the the gluteus minimus to the superior curved line, the other runs straight between the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, along with the superior gluteal nerve; both divi sions of the deep branch reach the tensor fasciae femoris 2 I

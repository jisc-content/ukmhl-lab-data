PREFACE. Paet I. of this Introduction to Anatomy was pub- lished in February 1875. By the publication of Part II. the work is completed. With a few excep- tions, the illustrations in tliis Part have been drawn on the wood, from original material and specimens, by my assistant. Dr J. HaUiday Scott, to whom I desire to express my thanks for the care he has taken in delineating the several objects. Except when stated otherwise, the microscopic objects, from which the illustrations of the minute anatomy of the organs have been taken, were prepared with his customary care and skill by my assistant, Mr A. B. Stirling. My thanks are also due to my friend. Dr J. A. PiusseU, for the trouble he has bestowed in revising the proof-sheets. March 1877.

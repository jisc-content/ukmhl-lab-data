PITUITAEY GLANDS. 573 PITUITAEY GLAND. The Pituitary Gland, or Hypophysis cerebri, is a small body, about the size of a pea, situated in the pituitary fossa in the upper surface of the body of the sphenoid bone. It is attached to the base of the brain by the funnel-shaped process, or infundibulum. It is divided into two lobes, an anterior and a posterior. The anterior is the larger, is invested by a capsule, and is divided by a framework of connective tissue into a number of small alveoli, which are occupied by groups of polygonal cells arranged in the form of columns. Blood-vessels pass into the connective tissue framework, in which is found a capillary plexus. The posterior lobe possesses a frame- work of connective tissue, intermingled with varicose nerve fibres, and small cells, some of which are polygonal, others fusiform. A plexus of capillaries lies in its connective tissue stroma. The anterior lobe corresponds in its type of structure with the supra-renal capsules, whilst the pos- terior lobe is an appendage of the brain. The pituitary body is larger in proportion in the fcetus than in the adult, and the cavity of the third ventricle is prolonged into it through the infundibulum. Though its function has not been ascertained, it is found throughout the vertebrata at the base of the brain.

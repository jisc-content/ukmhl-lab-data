543 OEIGIN OF LYMPHATICS, cavities have, therefore, been regarded as great lymph spaces freely communicating with the lymph-capillaries. But the fluid which the serous cavities contain is not lymph in the proper sense of the word, but a thin serum, in which a few lymph corpuscles may be suspended. In the view that the serous cavities are lymph spaces they may be regarded as affiliated to the lymph-lacun^ of the lower vertebrata. In the frog, for example, spaces exist in the subcutaneous region, which communicate with the lymphatic system, and in the same animal the aorta and other large arteries are enclosed in perivascular lymph spaces. The thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct are, as already described, the great channels of communication between the lymphatics and the veins, but other smaller connections have also been described in the human body. Wutzer saw in one subject two offshoots from the thoracic duct opening into the vena azygos. Nuhn has observed lymph-vessels opening into the renal veins and inferior cava; and Petrel has seen lymphatics communicating with the portal vein, renal veins, and vena azygos. It is possible that these smaller communications may enlarge and serve as important channels for the flow of lymph and chyle into the blood, in cases where the thoracic duct has become obliterated by pressure from an aneurism of the thoracic aorta. It maybe stated, that in amphibians, reptiles, and some birds, pulsating vesicles, with muscular walls, named lyni'pJiatic hearts, occur in connection with the termination of the lymph-vessels in the venous system, and, by their contraction, drive the lymph into the veins. No lymph hearts have, however, been found in the mammalia.

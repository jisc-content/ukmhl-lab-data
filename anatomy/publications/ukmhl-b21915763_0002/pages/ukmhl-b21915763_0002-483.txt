PLACENTA. 863 permanent cliorion, wliich. forms the outer envelope of the embryo, and is the proper medium of attachment to the wall of the uterus. The mode of origin of the secondary or persistent chorion has now to be considered. From the margin of the area germinativa a delicate fold arises, which, by becoming more and more elevated, gra- dually extends itself above the back of the young embryo, until at last the folds from opposite sides meet in the middle line, become continuous with each other, and form the membrane of the amnion. Between the amnion and the back of the embryo is a space, the cavity of the amnion, which increases in size by the secretion of the liquor amnii into it. The amnion consists -of two layers, an outer and an inner, and as it is derived from the area germinativa it is necessarily continuous with the blasto- derm. The inner layer of the amnion, which lies next the amniotic cavity, consists of tessellated epithelial cells, is derived from the epiblast, and is continuous with the cuticular layer of the embryo. The outer layer of the amnion is a thin stratum, continuous with the somato- pleure layer of the mesoblast, and formed of stellate and spindle-shaped cells, hke the corpuscles of embryonic con- nective tissue. The amnion is the most internal of the foetal membranes, and forms an ovoid bag in which the foetus and liquor amnii are contained. But before the amniotic folds meet to become continu- ous with each other, the free edge of each fold is bent out- wards, and, by a continuous process of growth, gradually spreads around the ovum, immediately within the zona pellucida, so as to form a layer, which was named by Von

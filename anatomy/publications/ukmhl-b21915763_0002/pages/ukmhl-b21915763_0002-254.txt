634 ANATOMY. aud sub-pleural connective tissue is the seat in the adult lung of the colouring matter, which gives the lung its dark colour. As a lobule of the lung is a miniature lung, it consists of the structures which characterise the lung itself. The bronchial tithe, before it enters the lung, resembles in form and structure the trachea. After it has passed in at the root, it immediately begins to divide into smaller bronchi. The process of division and sub-division goes on, usually in a dichotomous manner, as the bronchi extend into the lung substance, until at last minute bronchi are produced, which pass to the lobules of the lung, and are called lobular bronchial tubes (fig. 173). A lobular bronchial tube divides within the lobule into two or more terminal branches, which end by dilating into a number of minute chambers, called the 'pulmonary vesicles, air-vesicles, alveoli, or air-cells. The larger bronchial tubes within the lung correspond generally in their structure to the trachea; though with some modifications in the arrangement of the constituent tissues. The cartilage is not in the form of rings, but of irregularly-shaped plates arranged at intervals around the sides of the tube, which is cylindrical in form, and not, like the trachea, flattened posteriorly. These plates diminish in size and frequency in the smaller bronchi, and finally disappear when the bronchi attain a diameter of not more than about -j^th of an inch. The cartilaginous framework in both the bronchi and trachea keeps the air-tube open, and allows the free ingress and egress of air. The hbro- elaslic membrane connects the cartilaginous plates together ; it diminishes in strength and thickness as it extends into

654 ANATOMY. have described a cluster of glands at the tip of the tongue, between the genio-hyo-glossus, stylo-glossus and lingualis, opening by four or five ducts on the under surface of the tip. Structure.â€”The ducts of these mucous glands consist of a delicate membrane lined by a single layer of columnar epithelial cells. The terminal branches of the ducts, which enter the lobules, end in a series of saccular dilata- tions, the acini, alveoli, or gland vesicles, which contain rounded or polygonal secreting cells. A collection of such vesicles forms a lobule. The lobules are bound together by intermediate connective tissue, in which the blood- vessels divide into a capillary network, that ramifies on the outer surface of the delicate membrane forming the wall of the gland vesicles. The Salivary Glands op the Mouth are the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual glands. The Parotid gland is the largest salivary gland, and oc- cupies the parotid hollow between the ascending ramus of the lower jaw, the mastoid process of the temporal bone, the external auditory meatus, and the zygoma. Its anterior border overlaps the masseter muscle, and the excretory duct emerges out of this border. A prolonga- tion of gland substance, the socia parotidis, frequently accompanies the duct for a short distance. By its deep surface the gland passes as far as the styloid process, the parotid fossa in the temporal bone, the digastric muscle, internal carotid artery, and internal jugular vein. The gland is enclosed in a capsule formed of the cervical fascia. Passing into the gland is the external carotid artery, which gives off in it the occipital, posterior auricular, temporal and

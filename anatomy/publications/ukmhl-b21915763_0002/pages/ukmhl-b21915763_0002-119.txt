BLOOD CAPILLARIES. 499 arrangement of the tissues of the organ itself. In muscles, for instance, the strands of the capillary network are elon- gated, parallel to and between the muscular fibres and fasciculi: in most glands the network is irregularly poly- gonal : around the lobules of adipose tissue the spaces of the network are more rounded ; in papillary projections, like those of the skin, or mucous membranes, or placental vilU, the capillaries are arranged in the form of loops, which either may, or may not, be united into a network. The capillaries lie in the interstices between the proper tissues of the part or organ, and do not penetrate into the interior of the cells or fibres of which the tissues are com- posed. Organs vary considerably in their vascularity, and the vascularity of an organ depends upon the relative pro- portion of the capillaries that it contains to the proper substance of the tissue of the organ. The vascularity of an organ is in relation to its degree of functional activity, aijd in infancy and youth when parts are actively growing, their vascularity is greater than in adult life, when the growth has ceased. Some structures, as adult cartilage, the cornea, epithelium, hairs, nails, cuticle, and endothe- lium, have no capillaries passing into their substance, and are therefore non-vascular.

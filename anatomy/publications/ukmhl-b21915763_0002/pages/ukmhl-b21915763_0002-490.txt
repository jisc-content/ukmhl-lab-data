ANATOMY. 870 possesses two horns, the chorion becomes greatly elongated, and extends as far as the ends of both horns. In the Human ovum all trace of the zona pellucida has disappeared before the 10th day, and the secondary chorion, as Reichert’s observations show, is then an epi- theliated membrane, with unbranched villi projecting from, but not completely covering, its outer surface. At the 2nd week the chorion is covered with villi, which at the 3rd week are branched, and about the 4th week have ac- quired blood-vessels, from the growth into them of the vessels of the allantois. About the 6th week some of the villi begin to atrophy, and at the end of the 2nd month, when the ovum has attained the size of a hen’s egg, the viUi have disappeared from one pole, and are arranged over a discoid surface, which represents the placental area throughout the remaining period of gestation. In the mature placenta the villi are very arborescent, and extend from the chorionic to the decidual surface ; the terminal branches, which lie next the decidua, being attached to the placental surface of that membrane. The chorion and the basis substance of each villus are formed of a gela- tinous connective tissue continuous with a similar tissue in the umbilical cord. In it the branches of the umbilical vessels ramify, and the capillaries form simple or some- times double loops in the collateral terminal branches of the villi. Each villus is invested by a layer of cells, which have been recognised by anatomists since Dalrymple figured them upwards of thirty years ago, and to which Goodsir gave the name of the external cells of the villus. These cells are somewhat flattened, though not squamous, are rectangular in outline, and closely applied to each other

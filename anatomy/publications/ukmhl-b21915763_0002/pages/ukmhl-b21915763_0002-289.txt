669 (ESOPHAGUS. ■which, goes to Meckel’s ganglion, and sends branches to the palate in the descending palatine branches of that ganglion. The palato-pharyngeus and palato-glossus are probably supplied by the pharyngeal branches of the vagus. The sensory nerves to the mucous membrane are derived, from the second division of the fifth, through the descending palatine branches of Meckel’s ganglion. Sympathetic nerve fibres also probably accompany the descending pala- tine nerves. (ESOPHAGUS. The (Esophagus, or Gullet, is an almost cylindrical tube, about 9 or 10 inches long, which transmits the food from the pharynx to the stomach. It commences in the neck opposite the body of the sixth cervical vertebra, where it is continuous with the pharynx. It passes down the lower part of the neck, traverses the cavity of the thorax, pierces the diaphragm at the oesophageal opening, enters the abdo- men, and becomes continuous with the cardiac end of the stomach close to that opening. It lies in front of the bodies of the vertebrae, and follows the antero-posterior curvatures of the spine, but, at the lower part, both of the neck and thorax, it inclines somewhat to the left of the mesial plane. It is placed behind the trachea, the arch of the aorta, the heart, and pericardium. In the thorax it is situated in the posterior mediastinal division of the inter- pleural space, with the vena azygos to its right, and the descending aorta at first to its left and then behind it. It is closely accompanied in the greater part of its course by the pneumogastric nerves, which form a plexus around it. Structure.—The wall of the oesophagus consists of three

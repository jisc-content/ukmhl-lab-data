ANATOMY. 794 anterior surface, directed downwards and forwards, is in relation to the pubic bones and symphysis, and to the anterior wall of the abdomen, in the region of the hypo- gastrium, to all of which it is attached by loose areolar tissue. The posterior surface, directed upwards and back- wards, is covered by peritoneum, and is separated from the first part of the rectum by the recto-vesical pouch, in which some coils of the small intestine may be lying. The lateral surface is partially covered by peritoneum, and has the vas deferens and obliterated hypogastric artery running along it. The nech is situated immediately in front of the base, and gives origin to the urethra; it is the lowest or most depending part of the bladder, and in the male is embraced by the base of the prostate gland. Passing to the bladder are two important membranes, which, together with its vessels and ducts, retain it in position. These membranes are the peritoneum and the pelvic fascia. The Peritoneum forms the false ligaments of the bladder, and is arranged with reference to it as follows :â€”The peri- toneum is reflected from the rectum to the posterior surface of the bladder as two folds, named the posterior false liaaments. which form the lateral boundaries of the recto- vesical pouch, or pouch of Douglas. Having reached the bladder the peritoneum covers its posterior surface, and extends for a variable distance over the base or fundus; in the empty bladder the peritoneal covering for the base is more extensive than when the bladder is distended. The peritoneum passes over the sides of the bladder as far as the obliterated hypogastric arteries, when it is reflected to the side walls of the pelvis as the late>'al false ligammts.

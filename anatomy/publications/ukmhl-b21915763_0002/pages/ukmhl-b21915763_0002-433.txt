813 EJACULATOKY DUCTS. corresponds with, that of the sacculated portion of the vas. The tubular glands in its wall pour their secretion into it, so that its fluid contents consist not only of semen, but of the special secretion of these glands. The Common Ejaculatory Ducts are two in number, each being formed by the junction of the vas with the duct of the vesicula of its own side. Each common duct is about one inch long. They lie close together, and pass forwards, between the middle and lateral lobes of the prostate gland, to open in the prostatic part of the urethra, on the summit of the colliculus seminalis, one on each side of the mouth of the prostatic vesicle. Their walls are much thinner than those of the vesiculse seminales, the diminution being especially marked in the fibro-elastic coat. The excretory apparatus of the testicle, known by the several names of vasa eflferentia, epididymis, vas deferens, and common ejaculatory duct, is characterized by the extra- ordinary length and convoluted character of its tube. Whilst the actual distance between the testicle and the prostatic part of the urethra, in which the excretory apparatus ultimately opens, is not more than a few inches; the length of the tube which conveys the secretion into the urethra amounts to many feet. The inference which may naturally be drawn from this arrangement is, that the secretion of the testis passes but slowly from the gland to the vesiculae seminales and urethra, and probably undergoes a considerable amount of elaboration in its course.

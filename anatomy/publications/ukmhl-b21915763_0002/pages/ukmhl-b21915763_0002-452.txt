ANATOMY. 832 subjacent tissue abounding in corpuscles, wbicb projects from the interstitial tissue of tbe Wolffian body, and sub- sequently becomes tbe vascular stroma of tbe ovar3^ Both tbe epithelium and tbe vascular stroma of tbe ovary are differentiations of tbe cells of tbe mesoblast. Tbe superficial epitbelium is named by Waldeyer tbe germ epithelmm, for from its cells tbe ova are i^roduced. It consists of columnar corpuscles, arranged side by side so as to cover tbe free surface of tbe ovary. Each germ epitbelium corpuscle consists, as bas been pointed out by J. Eoulis, of an elongated, columnar-sbaped nucleus, invested by so tbin and delicate a layer of protoplasm, that tbe nucleus forms tbe most noticeable part of tbe corpuscle Tbe corpuscles are from o-j^T^tb to oJo^tb inch in tbeir long, and about -g-J^tb in tbeir short diameter. Waldeyer showed that changes then took place an some of these germ epithelial corpuscles; tbe nucleus swelled out into a spherical body, tbe protoplasm around the nucleus increased considerably in quantity, a nucleolus appeared within tbe nucleus, and the corpuscles assumed a spherical form, and formedâ€™a primordial ovum. At the same time involutions of tbe columnar germ epitbelium into tbe substance of tbe ovary are taking place on various parts of its surface, and some of tbe corpuscles of this involuted epitbelium pass through modifications in form and struc- ture similar to those seen in the epitbelium on tbe free surface of tbe ovary, so that spherical corpuscles, or pri- mordial ova, appear also in it. Tbe sub-epitbelial tissue, or ovarian stroma, now contains multitudes of fusiform connective tissue corpuscles, with some capillary blood- vessels. A coincident growth takes place in it, so that

TEETH. 767 series of milk-papillre are not, however, simultaneously pro- duced. From the observations of Goodsir, it has been shown that the milk-papilla of the anterior molar in the upper jaw appears about the seventh week, then the canine papilla, the two incisor papillae, and the posterior molar papilla are successively formed, the last making its appear- ance about the end of the tenth week. The dental papiUae in the upper jaw immediately precede the papillae of the corresponding teeth in the lower jaw. The eruption of the milk teeth into the mouth does not begin to take place until the latter half of the first year of extra-uterine life, and is not completed until between the second aud third year. Though variations occur in the date of eruption of each tooth in different children, it may be stated that the incisors usually appear from the seventh to the ninth month; the anterior molars from the twelfth to the sixteenth month; the canines during the seventeenth or eighteenth month; the posterior milk molars from two to two and a half years. The milk teeth begin to be shed about the sixth year by the dropping out of the incisors. The last to be shed are the canines, which do not fall out until the tenth or eleventh year. The shedding of the milk teeth is preceded by the absorption of the fangs. This is effected, as was satisfactorily shown by J. Tomes, by the agency of a group of cells situated at the bottom of the sockets. As these cells occasion absorption of the tooth tissue, similar to that occurring in the bone tissue from the action of the large, many nucleated osteo-klast cells (p. 172), they may appropriately be called odonto-klasts. The development of the permanent teeth will now be con- sidered. In the description of the arrangement of the

Watney states that a deli- cate reticulum continuous with the most superficial layer of corpuscles of the connective tissue is prolonged between the epithelium cells. In the axis of the viUus one, or perhaps two, minute lacteals or chyle vessels are situated, which serve as rootlets of origin of the lacteal division of the lymph vascular system. The lacteal is a capillary tube, wliich ends near the apex of the villus, as a dilated microscopic cul-de-sac. By its ojDposite extremity it becomes continuous with a plexus of lacteals in the submucous coat. When treated with nitrate Fig. 190.—A transyerse section through an intestinal Villus A, showing its epi- thelial investment, and the matrix of Lymphoid tissue; c, columnar epithelium ; g, goblet-sliaped cell; I, lacteal; »•, r, lymphoid retiform tissue; v, v, trans- ver.sely divided blood-vessels. B, free ends of columnar epithelium, with mouths of foul’ goblet-shaped cells, x 300. of silver, its waU is seen to consist of flattened endothelial cells, which are connected with the retiform tissue of the matrix substance. In the matrix substance, around the lacteal vessel of the villus, is a layer of non-striped mus- cular fibro-cells, which is continuous with the general muscular layer of the mucous coat, and extends as far as the apex of the villus. By the contraction of this layer the (?hyle during absorption is propelled along the lacteal

TEETH. 765 stellate, and form with each other an anastomosing net- work of cells like those sometimes seen in the gelatinous connective tissue. After the tooth has become sacculated, and coincident with the transformation of the odonto-blast cells of the dental papilla into dentine, calcification begins in the elongated prismatic cells of the internal or enamel epithelium; their protoplasm becomes calcified, and they become the rods or prisms of the enamel. As the hardening takes place from the periphery to the centre of each cell, the axial portion may, as Tomes pointed out, remain soft for some time in the axis of the enamel rod. With the in- crease in length and with the calcification of the cells of the enamel epitheUum, the stellate gelatinous cells disappear, and the outer ends of the enamel rods come in contact with the cells of the external enamel epithelium. By some observers the external epithelium is supposed to disappear without undergoing any special differentiation, but by others it is believed to undergo conversion into Nasmythâ€™s membrane. In this manner the crown of a tooth is formed, and it is lodged in a membranous sac formed by the differentiation into a fibro-vascular membrane of the surrounding connec- tive tissue. Whilst within its sac the crown of the tooth possesses the characteristic form of the group of teeth to which it belongs. After the calcification of the enamel rods is completed, it can undergo no further change either in shape, or in increase of size. Whilst the crown of the tooth is being formed, ossifica- tion of the jaws has been going on, and the tooth, with its membranous sac, has become lodged in an alveolus or

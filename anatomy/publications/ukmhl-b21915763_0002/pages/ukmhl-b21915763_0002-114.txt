ANATOMY. 494 The miter coat of the artery, or tunica adventitia, con- sists of interlaced bundles of white fibrous tissue mingled with elastic fibres. In the larger arteries, the proportion of elastic tissue increases in the deeper part of this coat, so as to form an elastic layer. In some arteries, as the aorta, splenic, and renal arteries, bundles of non-striped muscular fibre arranged longitudinally or obliquely, have been de- scribed in the deeper part of the outer coat. The middle coat consists in medium-sized arteries chiefly of non-striped muscular fibres, arranged transversely to the long axis of the artery, so that this coat is sometimes named the circular or muscular coat. The muscular coat forms several layers, which may be peeled asunder. Be- tween the layers, as well as between the muscular fibres in each layer, elastic fibres are found. In the largest arteries, as the aorta and pulmonary, the proportion of the elastic to the muscular constituent of this coat is so very greatly increased as to form layers of elastic tissue in the middle coat. The elastic fibres of the middle coat pass on the one hand into the elastic layer of the outer coat, and on the other into the elastic layer of the inner coat. The inner coat or tunica intima has its free surface, i.e., the surface next the lumen of the artery, formed of a single layer of flattened, elongated, squamous endothelial cells, which give a smooth glistening surface for the blood to flow over. Oiitside the endothelium is an extra-endothelial layer, consisting of a delicate connective tissue in which stellate corpuscles are situated : outside this layer is the elastic or fenestrated layer, which forms the chief thickness of the inner coat. The fenestrated layer consists of an elastic membrane, which may be slit up into several strata.

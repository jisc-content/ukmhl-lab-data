618 AITATOMY. tracheal cartilage with, the cricoid cartilage, aud completes the wall of the trachea posteriorly by passing between the posterior ends of the cartilaginous rings. The muscular tissue consists of non-striped fibres, which lie in the posterior wall of the trachea, under cover of the fibro-elastic membrane. They pass for the most part transversely, and not only extend between the posterior ends of the cartilaginous rings, but lie also opposite the intervals between them. The submucous coat is distinguished by containing, especially in the posterior wall of the trachea, longitudinal bundles of elastic fibres. In this coat are situated numer- ous compound racemose glands, the branches of which on section are like cylindrical tubes : they are lined by a columnar epithelium, and the excretory duct opens on the free surface of the mucous membrane. The mucotis membrane lines the inner surface of the trachea, and is elevated on the posterior wall into longi- tudinal folds, which correspond to the bundles of elastic fibres in the submucous coat. The free surface of the mucous membrane is covered by a layer of ciliated colum- nar epithelium, amidst which goblet-shaped cells are inter- spersed. Between the deeper ends of the ciliated epi- thelium, smaller spindle-shaped, or rounded, cells are found in considerable numbers. Deeper than the epithelium is a muscular layer, the muscularis mucosÂ®. Lymphoid tissue is also found diffused throughout the sub-epithelial tissue of the mucous membrane, and occupjfing the intervals between the vesicles of adjacent racemose glands. The trachea is supplied with blood by brauches from the laryngeal branches of the inferior thyu'oid arteries. Lyur

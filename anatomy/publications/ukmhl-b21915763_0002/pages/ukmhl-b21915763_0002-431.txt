811 VAS DEFERENS. possess a distinct lining of columnar and ciliated epithelial cells, but the ciha disappear in the globus minor. The blood and lymph vessels and the nerves of the testicle are continuous with those to which reference has been made in the description of the spermatic cord. According to Letzerich, the nerve fibres pierce the proper wall of the seminal tubules, and end in clumps of proto- plasm, having a direct relation to the sperm cells. Haller described a tubular diverticular prolongation from the globus minor of the epididymis by the name of vas aherrans. It varies in length from inch to 14 inches, and lies parallel to and between the epididymis and the vas deferens, and is convoluted like the former tube. In structure it resembles the vas deferens. Girald^s discovered in 1857 a small body situated beneath the tunica vaginalis, covering the front of the spennatic cord, immediately above the head of the epididy- mis, which has been named the 'parepididymis, or organ of Giraides. It varies in size from a mere speck to a body 4 or 5 lines long, and consists of small convoluted tubes lined with a squamous epithelium. The Vas Deferens is the tubular duct, about two feet in length, which conveys the semen from the epididymis to the urethra. It arises from the globus minor of the epididymis, with the convoluted tube of which it is con- tinuous. It is tortuous at its commencement, and ascends behind the epididymis, then enters the cord, and is con tinned upwards, behind the spermatic vessels, through the inguinal canal, as far as the internal or deep abdominal ring. Here it leaves the spermatic vessels, curves round the outer side of the deep epigastric artery, and sinks into

LARGE INTESTINE. . 721 in two laysrs from without inwards. Tho outer layer con- sists of longitudinal fasciculi, which are not as a rule dis- tributed uniformly in_ the wall, but in the ccecum and colon are collected into three longitudinal bands, which start from the ccecum, where it is joined by the appendix vermiformis, and extend along the colon to the rectum. One band extends along the meso-colic or attached aspect of the bowel, another along the anterior aspect, whilst the third is situated on the inner aspect of the ascending and descending colon, and the under aspect of the transverse colon. As these bands are not so long as the colon itself, they occasion the puckering or constric- tions in the wall which separate the sacculi, so that when the bands are cut through the sacculi disappear. The colon then becomes more elongated and cylindriform. In the appendix vermiformis the longitudinal layer is not collected into bands, but arranged uniformly along the wall. In the rectum, also, the longitudinal layer is spread uniformly along the wall, and forms a well-defined red- coloured layer. Slender fasciculi have been described as passing from this layer to the adjacent pelvic fascia, and to the subcutaneous tissue about the anus, and Luschka has traced some bundles into the anterior sacro-coccygeal ligament. The inner layer of the muscular coat consists of circular fasciculi distributed around the wall of the large intestine. In the rectum this layer increases in thickness, and in proximity to the anus forms a circular muscle, the sphincter ani internus, which is a strong band, about half an inch broad, around the lower end of the rectum. In the large, as in the small intestine, the muscular coat

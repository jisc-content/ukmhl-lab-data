ANATOMY. 42 G and ileum; in their course they bifurcate, and the branches of bifurcation of adjacent arteries inosculate to form arterial arcades, three or four series of which may be found in the meseutery; from the series next the intestine branches pass to the wall of the bowel: c, ileocolic branch, which passes to the right iliac fossa to supply the lower end of the deum, caecum, and ascending colon: d, right colic branch, which runs to the ascending colon to supply it: e, the middle colic branch, which passes between the layers of the meso-colon to the transverse colon to supply it. AH these colic arteries bifurcate, anastomose, and form arterial arcades after the manner of the branches to the small intestine. The Inpekior Mesenteric artery arises from the aorta a short distance above its bifurcation. It lies behind the peritoneum covering the posterior wall of the abdomen, and passes downwards to the left iliac fossa, where it enters the meso-rectum, and takes the name of superior hcemorrhoidal artery, and supplies the coats of the rectum. It gives off a, the left colic branch, which runs to the descending colon to supply it ; h, sigmoid branch, which runs between the two layers of the meso-colon to the sigmoid flexure to supply it; these branches bifurcate, anastomose, and form arterial arcades as on the right side. The arteries which supply the coats of the alimentary tube from the oesophagus to the rectum, anastomose freely with each other in the wall of the tube, or iu its mesenteric attachment, and the anastomoses are usually by the for- mation of arches or loops between adjacent branches. Thus the oesophageal branches of the aorta anastomose with each other and with the oesophageal branch of the

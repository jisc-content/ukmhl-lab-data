665 SOFT PALATE. from the ascending pharyngeal branch of the external carotid, the ascending palatine and tonsillar of the facial, and the palato-pharyngeal and descending palatine branches of the internal maxiUary. The motor nerves of the pharynx are derived from the pharyngeal branches of the vagus, the external laryngeal nerve and the glosso- pharyngeal nerve. The sensory nerves arise from the pharyngeal branches of the glosso-pharyngeal, and from the pharyngeal branch of Meckelâ€™s ganglion, which latter supplies the mucous lining of the nasal part of the pharynx. Sympathetic nerve fibres pass to the pharynx from the superior cervical ganglion. The motor, sensory, and sympathetic nerves unite to form the pharyngeal plexus situated behind the middle constrictor muscle. The Soft Palate forms an inclined plane, which pro- jects, downwards and backwards into the pharynx, from the posterior border of the hard palate. It is less dependent at the sides than in the mesial plane, where it forms an elongated body, the uvula. From its position it is in rela- tion both to the mouth and the pharynx. Its anterior or oral surface is smooth, and gives origin on each side to a fold, which curves downwards to the side of the root of the tongue, to form the anterior pillars of the palate or fauces. Its posterior or pharyngeal surface, also smoooth, gives origin on each side to a fold, which, springing from the base of the uvula, curves downwards and backwards to be lost in the side walls of the pharynx; this pair of folds forms the posterior pillars of the palate or fauces. Structure. The soft palate is complex in structure, and consists of muscles, mucous membrane, glands, blood and lymph vessels, and nerves. The muscles of the soft 2 u

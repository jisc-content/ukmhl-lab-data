CHAPTEE XII. EEPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. The Keproductive System consists of organs, the office of which is to provide for the perpetuation of the race. These organs differ from each other in the two sexes : but, both in the male and female, the materials essential for the reproductive process are the products of two genital glands, and are conveyed along a system of tubes and passages. Male Oegaijs of Eepeoduction. The essential organs of Eeproduction in the male are the Testicles, or genital glands, in which the semen is secreted. From each testicle a duct proceeds, called Vas Deferens, which conveys the semen to the Urethra. The male urethra is for the greater part of its extent contained in the Penis, or organ of copulation. Certain accessory structures to the male generative apparatus are named Vesicute Seminales, Prostate Gland, and Cowperâ€™s Glands.

673 ABDOMEN. tlie fascia transversalis: the linea alba occupies its middle line, and about the middle of the linea alba is the um- hiliens or navel: the anterior wall below is formed by the two pubic bones with the symphysis. The lateral walls, or flanks, are formed above by the flat muscles of the abdomi- nal wall and the fascia transversalis, and below on each side by the ilium and ischium with the muscles attached to them. The posterior wall is formed by the lumbar spine, sacrum, and coccyx, and by the muscles attached to these bones with their accompanying fasciae. The abdomen is primarily divided into the pelvis and abdomen proper. The pelvis is subdivided into the false pelvis, or part above the pelvic brim, and true pelvis, or part below the pelvic brim. The abdomen proper is subdivided into nine regions, the boundaries of which are not regulated by anatomical struc- tures, but by certain lines drawn upon the surface of the body, which are supposed to be prplonged through thp cavity in imaginary planes. An upper horizontal line is drawn on a level with the most prominent part of the ninth pair of costal cartilages, and a lower horizontal line on a level with the summit of the iliac crest. Through these lines the abdomen is divided into three zones, an upper or costal, a middle or lumbar, a lower or iliac. Each of these zones is subdivided into three regions by two vertical lines drawn perpendicularly upwards from the middle of Poupartâ€™s ligament. The costal zone is sub- divided into two lateral regions, the right and the left hypochondrium, and a middle or ejiigastrium; the epigas- trium lies immediately below the xiphi-steruum, in the interval of divergence between the costal cartilages of

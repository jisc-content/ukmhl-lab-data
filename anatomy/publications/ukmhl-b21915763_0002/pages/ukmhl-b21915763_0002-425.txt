805 TESTIS. cord consists of the spermatic artery, a branch of the abdominal aorta; of the spermatic veins, which form a well-marked plexus, called the pampiniform plexus: of lymphatics, which communicate with the iliac and lumbar lymphatics : of nerves which are derived from the aortic plexus of the sympathetic, aud accompany the spermatic artery, and of the vas deferens. But the vas deferens has a small special artery accompanying it, a branch of the superior vesical artery, and the coverings of the cord receive the cremasteric branch of the epigastric artery. The genital branch of the geuito- crural nerve supplies the cre- master muscle. The testicle is suspended by the spermatic cord and its coverings in the scrotum, in which it lies obliquely; the left testicle being usually a little larger aud more dependent than the right. It is ovoid in form, compressed laterally ; and pos- sesses two lateral surfaces, two borders, and two extremities. It is about li inch in its ver- tical diameter, li inch in its antero-posterior diameter, and 225—The Testicle, as seen from ’ behind; wi, globus major; 6, the half an inch from side to side eiobus minor of ■ epididymis; vd, vas deferens. The whole of the exterior of the gland, except the posterior border, is smooth, aud invested by the visceral layer of the peritoneum. The

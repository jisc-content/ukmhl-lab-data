ANATOMY. 700 be freely moved about in the abdominal cavity, so that they are apt to be displaced from tbeir natural position, and, when a rupture occurs, to become tbe most usual contents of the hernial sac. The lower end of the ileum passes into the right iliac fossa, where it becomes continuous with the large intestine, at the junction of the coecum and ascending colon. Though the line of demarcation between jejunum and ileum is an arbitrary one, yet the upper end of the jejunum may be distinguished from the lower end of the ileum by being wider, and having a thicker mucous membrane, in which the folds called valvuloe conniventes are larger and more numerous. There is occasionally found projecting from the lower third of the ileum a short prolongation of that tube, which forms an elongated hollow process, terminating at its free end in a cnl-de-sac. It is named diverticulum Uei. It may vary in length from half-an-inch to sis or seven inches, and usually projects from the convex aspect of the circumference of the bowel. On rare occasions it has been seen to be attached to the wall of the abdomen in the region of the navel by a slender band of fibrous tissue. The diverticulum is of interest as representing a per- sistent condition of the omphalo-mesenteric or vitello- intestinal duct, which in the embryo connects the umbilical vesicle with the primitive intestine. Structtire of the Small Intestine. Â« The wall of the small intestine consists in the greater part of its extent, of four coats, named from without in- wards, serous, muscular, submucous, aud mucous coats.

589 CARTILAGES OF LARYNX, backwards, diverging from each other to form a retreat- ing angle, and enclosing the smaller cartilages of the larynx. Each plate is marked on its outer surface by an oblique ridge for the attachment of the thyro-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, whilst the inner surface is smooth, and for the most part covered by mucous membrane. The upper border of each plate is attached to the hyoid bone by a broad fibro-elastic membrane, the thyro-hyoid mem- brane, and the lower border is united to the upper border of the cricoid cartilage by the crico-thyroid membrane. The posterior border gives attachment to the palato- pharyngeus and the stylo-pharyngeus muscles, and is pro- longed into two cornua. The superior cornu is attached to the tip of the great cornu of the hyoid by a rounded elastic band, the thyro-hyoid ligament, in which a nodule of cartilage, cartilago triticea, is often situated j the inferior cornu is short, and articulates with the side of the cricoid cartilage by a movable joint. The Cricoid, or ring-like cartilage, is the lowest cartilage of the lar3mx, and completely surrounds the tube. Its vertical diameter posteriorly is about one inch, but an- teriorly not more than inch. Its outer surface possesses posteriorly a mesial vertical ridge, to the side of which is a depression for the origin of the posterior crico-arytenoid muscle (fig. 161). On each lateral aspect of the cartilage is an articular facet for the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage, anterior to which is a surface for the attachment of the crico-thyroid muscle. The inner surface of the cricoid cartilage is smooth, and lined by mucous membrane. Its lower border is almost horizontal, and is attached by membrane to the first ring of the trachea.

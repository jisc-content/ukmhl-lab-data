LARGE INTJISTINE, 723 ia the small intestine, are also present; but no Peyer s patches. The muscularis mucosm resembles generally that of the small intestine. Of the blood-vessels of the large intestine, the arteries are principally derived from the colic branches of the superior mesenteric and the several branches of the inferior mesenteric artery; but the lower end of the rectum receives the middle hsemorrhoidal branches of the internal iliac, and the inferior hsemorrhoidal branches of the pudic. The veins which correspond to these arteries for the most part join the superior and inferior mesenteric veins, and are consequently rootlets of the portal vein. But the veins which belong to the middle and inferior hsemorrhoidal arteries form a plexus about the anal orifice, which partly joins the superior hsemorrhoidal vein, and through it the portal vein, and is partly connected through the middle and inferior hemorrhoidal veins with the internal iliac vein, and through it with the inferior vena cava. The veins about the anus are very apt to become varicose, and to form the excrescences termed hemorrhoids or piles. The lymph vessels are arranged as in the small intestine, except that they are not prolonged into villi. Nervous plexuses with ganglion cells are found in both the muscular and submucous coats. They proceed from the superior and inferior mesenteric plexuses, but the rectum â– receives branches from the hypogastric plexus, and from the third and fourth sacral spinal nerves.

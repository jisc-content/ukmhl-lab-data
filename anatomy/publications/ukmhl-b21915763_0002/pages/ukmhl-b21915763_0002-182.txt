562 ANATOMY. body possessed a definite capsule which, separated it from the surrounding spleen pulp, but it is now known that the appearance of a capsule is due to only a greater density of the peripheral layers of the lymphoid tissue, of which the Malpighian body is composed. The meshes of the lymphoid tissue of the Malpighian body are infiltrated with colourless lymph cells. Busk and Huxley showed that the retiform tissue which forms the supporting framework of these lymph cells is continuous with the retiform tissue of the pulp. Capillaries are distributed within the Malpighian bodies, which may arise either from the arteries that penetrate them, or may enter them from without. The capillary terminations of the finest branches of the splenic artery, both in the Malpighian bodies and in the surrounding spleen pulp, do not end directly in veins, but, according to W. Muller and Frey, open into the interstices of the intervascular network already described. The wall of the capillary, it is said, loses its tubular form, and its endothelium becomes continuous with the stellate cells of the retiform connective tissue of the pulp. Schweigger- Seidel and W. Muller state, that whilst some of the capil- laries possess simple walls, others have distinct sheaths, consisting of a delicate connective tissue with round or elongated nuclei, and Frey has pointed out, that as this sheath approaches the arterioles, it assumes the char- acters of lymphoid tissue. If the splenic artery be carefully injected, the injection passes out of the capillaries, and forms an anastomosing stellate network, situated between the colourless corpuscles of the spleen pulp. At first sight it appears as if the

758 ANATOMY. nerves and blood-vessels of the tooth, which pass into the pulp, through the foramen at the point of the fang. The vessels form a beautiful plexus of capillaries. The nerves are sensory branches of the fifth cranial nerve. They enter the pulp as medullated fibres, which divide into very fine non-medullated fibres, that form a net- work in the peripheral portions of the pulp. Boll de- tected delicate branches of this network passing outwards between the odontoblast cells, but no twigs were seen to enter the dentine tubes. The pulp of the tooth is the remains of the formative papilla., out of which the dentine or ivory has been produced. In adult teeth changes that lead to the production of osteo-dentine and vaso-dentine may take place in it. Through the dentinal fibres an organic connection is preserved between the dentine and the pulp, and the sensitiveness exhibited by the dentine in some states of a tooth is not necessarily due to the passage of nerves into it, but to its connection with the sensitive dentine pulp. Development of the Teeth. In studying the development of the teeth, not only has the mode of formation of the individual teeth to be exa- mined, but the order of succession of the different teeth both in the temporary and permanent series. The teeth are developed in the mucous membrane or gum, which covers the edges of the jaws of the young embryo, and their formation is due to a special differentiation in the arrangement and structure of portions of the epithelial and sub-epithelial tissues of that membrane.

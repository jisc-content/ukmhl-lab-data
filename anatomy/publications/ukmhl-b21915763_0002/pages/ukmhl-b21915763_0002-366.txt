In Man the dentition is Diphyodont and Heterodont. The single row of teeth in each alveolar arch of the human jaw is characterised by the crowns of the teeth being of almost equal length, and by the absence of any great interspace, or diastema, between the dijfferent teeth, or of irregularities in the size of the interspaces, so that the teeth form an unbroken series in each jaw. The span of the upper dental arch is slightly bigger than that of the lower, so that the lower incisorg fit within the upper, and the lower molars, being inclined obliquely upwards and inwards, are somewhat overlapped by the upper molars. The upper and lower dental arches terminate behind in line with each other, and the teeth^are equal in number in the two jaws. Man possesses 32 teeth in his permanent dentition, arranged in four groups, viz,—8 incisors, 4 canines, 8 / fore called Heterodont. In every Heterodont mammal, possessing a complete denti- tion, four groups of teeth are found, which are named in- cisor, canine, premolar, and molar teeth. Each of these

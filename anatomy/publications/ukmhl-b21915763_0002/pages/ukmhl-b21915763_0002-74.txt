It frequently inosculates with the ulnar artery to assist in forming the superficial palmar arch. k. Recurrent branches run to the front of the wrist to supply the synovial membrane enveloping the flexor tendons. l. Perforating branches pass between the heads of the three inner dorsal interossei muscles to the back of the hand. m. Palmar Interossei, three in number, descend on and supply the interossei muscles in the three inner metacarpal spaces. The branches which arise from the radial may be arranged according to their distribution in six groupsâ€” Isi. To muscles of fore arm : muscular arteries. 2cf. To elbow joint: radial recurrent artery. 2>d. To wrist joint: anterior and posterior radial carpal and recurrent of deep arch. Aith. To muscles of thumb : superficial volar artery. bth. To interossei muscles : dorsal and palmar inter- osseous arteries. 6^7t. To digits: arteria magna pollicis and art. radialis indicis. Inosculations take place freely in the upper limb be- tween the branches of the different arteries. Around the shoulder the scapulo-humeral set of branches of the axil- lary anastomose with each other, and with the posterior and suprascapular branches of the subclavian. In the upper arm anastomoses take place between the mus- cular branches of the brachial and the circumflex

407 THE HEAET. wall of tlie chest is of importance in connection with the diagnosis of disease of the valves. The pulmonary open- ing lies behind the articulation of the third left costal car- tilage with the sternum, and the trunk of the pulmonary artery ascends, prior to its bifurcation, as high as the level of the second left costal cartilage. The aortic opening, somewhat lower down than the pulmonary, and posterior to it, is situated behind the left border of the sternum, on a level with the third intercostal space. The right auriculo- ventricular or tricuspid opening, lies behind the sternum, on a level with the fourth pair of costal cartilages. The left auriculo-ventricular or mitral opening is on the same plane as the right tricuspid opening, but to its left side. Structure.â€”The walls of the cavities of the heart are chiefly formed of striped muscular fibre, over the contrac- tions of which the Will exercises no control; but, in addition, connective tissue, a little fibro-cartilaginous tissue, the endocardium, and vessels and nerves are also found. The muscular fibres are collected into fasciculi, which have a reticulated arrangement, and the fibres themselves branch and again unite to form a complicated network. The fibres of the walls of the auricles are distinct from those of the ventricles, so that the auricular and ventricular compartments are connected together, not by an inter- change of muscular tissue, but by an intermediate ring- like arrangement of fibres of connective tissue, known as the auriculo^entricular rings. The muscular fasciculi of the auricles are arranged in two strata. The deeper stratum consists of fibres proper to each auricle, some of which run obliquely in the wall, others surround the auricula, and others are prolonged in rings into the coats of the vense

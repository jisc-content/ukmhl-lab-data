THORAX. 611 increase during the inspiratory, and diminish during the expiratory movements. The capacity of the thorax in men is greater than in women. In women, during respir- ation, a greater range of movement takes place in the upper part of the thoracic walls than in men, in whom the lower part of the chest passes through a wide range of movement. In young children again the diaphragm, much more than the thoracic walls, is concerned in inspiration, and the abdominal viscera are therefore much depressed, and the anterior abdominal wall is pushed forwards. Modifications of the natural form of the thorax may arise from congenital malformations of its walls : from external pressure artificially applied, as tight lacing ; from diseases of its walls, as in curvatures of the spine : or from diseases of the viscera contained in its cavity, as from pleuritic effusions, emphysema, aneurisms or other tu- mours, &c. When the bones of the shoulder girdle, and the great muscles which pass from them to the walls of the chest are in position, and when these are covered by the fascia and skin, the external configuration of the chest is very ma- terially modified. The outward projection of the shoulders, more especially in men, causes the transverse diameter to be greater at the upper part of the chest than lower down; and the pectoral and scapular muscles add materially to the thickness of the anterior and posterior walls of the chest. In order to assist in localising precisely the position of the important organs within the chest, it is customary to map out the surface of the integument into certain areas or regions, and to apply to these regions descriptive names. Thus, the region corresponding to the sternum is the sternal

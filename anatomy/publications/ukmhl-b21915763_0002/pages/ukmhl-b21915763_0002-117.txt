497 BLOOD CAPILLAEIES. THE BLOOD CAPILLAEIES. The blood capillaries are the minute tubes which connect together the terminal branches of the arteries and the rootlets of the veins. They vary in diameter from to inch, and the finest capillaries are so narrow that only a single blood corpuscle can lie in the transverse dia- meter of the tube. The structure of the wall of a capillary blood vessel is very simple. It consists of a single layer of elongated, squamous endothelial cells, united together by their somewhat crenulated margins, so as to form the wall of the tube. The outlines of these cells can be de- monstrated after the addi- tion of a solution of nitrate of silver. The nuclei of the cells are coloured by carmine, or can be seen after the addition of acetic acid. Minute spots are sometimes seen be" tween the cells, which have been interpreted as orifices or stomata in the capillary waU, but the accu- racy of this interpretation is very doubtful. The en- dothelial wall of the capillaries is continuous with the endothelial lining of the arteries and veins, so that a con- tinuity of the walls of the blood tubes is ensured. In many localities, as the lymph-glands and follicles, the spinal cord, the ovaries, (fee., the endothelial waU. is invested by a deli- cate coat of connective tissue, which forms a tunica adven- Fig. 134.â€”The endothelial wall of the capillaries of the retina.

The Anterior Intercostal Fibrous Membrane stretches between the lower border of one costal cartilage, and the upper border of the cartilage immediately below it. It lies superficial to the intercartilaginous part of the internal intercostal muscle. In the case of the sternal ribs, the membrane reaches from the anterior border of the external intercostal muscle to the side of the sternum, whilst in the case of the a-sternal ribs, it connects their cartilages without reaching the sternum. The Posterior Intercostal Fibrous Membrane stretches between the lower border of the neck and shaft of one rib and the upper border of the neck and shaft of the rib immediately below. It reaches from the posterior border of the internal intercostal muscle as far as the head of the rib ; it is in relation to the inner surface of the posterior fibres of the external intercostal muscle, and between the two are the intercostal vessels and nerve. The Triangulis Sterni muscle lies behind the costal car- tilages of the lower true ribs. It arises from the side of the xiphi-sternum and the sternal ends of the sixth and seventh costal cartilages; it passes obliquely upwards and outwards in separate digitations to be inserted into the costal cartilages, from the second to the fifth inclusive, at their junction with the bony part'of the rib. The Intra- or Sub-costal muscles are irregular in number and size. They are situated on the inner surface of the ribs in the region of the angles, and are chiefly found attached to the lower ribs. Their fibres run obliquely

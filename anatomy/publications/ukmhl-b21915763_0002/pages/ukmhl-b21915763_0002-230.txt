610 ANATOMY. bra. The point of the xipbi-sternum is opposite the body of the twelfth dorsal vertebra in expiration, but in in- spiration is raised to opposite the body of the eleventh vertebra. The base of the thorax is filled in by the diaphragm, which forms the floor of the thorax and the vaulted roof of the abdomen. At the end of an expiration, the summit of the diaphragm mounts as high as the level of the sternal end of the fourth intercostal space on the right side, but not quite so high on the left; from this summit level it slopes downwards and backwards to the costal origins of the muscle. The thoracic surface of the diaphragm is therefore convex. The diaphragm is perforated to allow of the passage of the oesophagus, nervi vagi, aorta, and sympathetic nervous cords downwards into the abdomen, and of the thoracic duct, vena azygos and inferior vena cava upwards into the thorax. The antero-posterior diameter of the thorax is less than either the transverse or vertical diameters. The antero- posterior diameter in the mesial plane, i.e., the sterno- vertebral diameter, though it increases from above down- wards, is less than it is on one side of the sternum, for the projection forwards of the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae, and the backward slope of the posterior ends of the ribs, cause a considerable hollow at the side of the vertebral bodies, in which the posterior border of the lung is lodged. The transverse diameter rapidly increases from the first to the 6 th or 7th ribs, and then diminishes somewhatdown to the 12th rib. The vertical diameter is much greater, owing to the more backward slope of the diaphragm at the costo- vertebral than at the costo-sternal wall. All the diameters

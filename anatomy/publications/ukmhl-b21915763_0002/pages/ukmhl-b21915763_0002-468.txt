ANATOMY. 848 mucous membrane wbicb is elevated in the virgin into two longitudinal folds, one on the anterior, the other on the posterior wall, and into numerous transverse folds; these folds almost entirely disappear in women who have borne several children. The free surface of the mucosa is covered by a stratified squamous epithelium, into which numerous papillae project. The ducts of numerous small mucous glands and follicles open into it; lymph corpuscles and lymph follicles are also scattered through it. It is supplied with blood by branches of the uterine, vesical, and vaginal arteries, derived from the internal iliac. The veins corresponding to these arteries form a vaginal plexus around it. Lymphatic vessels form plexuses in its wall. Its nerves, derived from the hypogastric plexus of the sympathetic, and from the 4th sacral and pudic nerves, also form plexuses in which are numerous microscopic ganglia. The external orifice of the vagina is, in the virgin, to a large extent closed up by a fold of the mucous membrane, named the Hymen, This membrane does not form a com- plete partition, but is usually semilunar in shape, with the concave free border directed towards the pubes. At times the hymen passes completely round the orifice of the vagina, when it is pierced by a circular opening near the centre. In rare cases the hymen is imperforate. The hymen is ruptured in the act of copulation, and its remains form some papillary elevations around the orifice of the vagina called camnmlce myrtiformes. The Bulho-cavernosns muscle, or compressor hulhi, sur- rounds the orifice of the vagina and the wall of the vesti- bule. It is formed of striped muscle, which arises from

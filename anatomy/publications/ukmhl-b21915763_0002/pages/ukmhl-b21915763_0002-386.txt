ANATOMY. 766 socket in the jaw, which alveolus is closed in by the gum. In order that the crown of the tooth may come into use as a masticatory organ, it has to be elevated to the level of the gum, which is absorbed by the pressure, and the crown then erupts into the cavity of the mouth. The process of eruption is due to the development of the fang, which, as it grows in length, elevates the crown of the tooth and forces it outward. The dentine of the fang is developed from the odonto-blast cells of the pulp in a manner similar to that already described for the development of the den- tine of the crown. The cement or crusta petrosa is de- veloped from the connective tissue lining the alveolus, which forms the alveolo-dental periosteum. It is therefore an ossification in membrane. As the temporary or milk teeth precede the permanent 3 4 Fig. 214.—One-half the lower jaw of a fojtus about the 11th or 12th week, show- ing the dental papillte in the order of their appearance. 1, the first milk molar; 2, the canine; 3 and 4, the two incisors; 6, the second milk molar.— From Goodsir.

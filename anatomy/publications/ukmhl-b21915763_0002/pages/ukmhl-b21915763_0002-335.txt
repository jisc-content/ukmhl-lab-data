LARGE INTESTINE. 715 wards towards the pelvis, or be elevated in. front of the stomach, or thrown to the right or left side. This ten- dency to displacement of the transverse colon should be kept in mind in the diagnosis of diseases of the abdominal viscera. The Splenic Flexure of the Colon is continuous on the one hand with the transverse colon, and on the other with the descending colon, and is attached to the diaphragm by the phrenico-colic fold of peritoneum. It lies in the left hypochondrium in close relation to the spleen. The Descending or Left Colon connects the splenic and sigmoid flexures, and occupies the left lumbar region. It is attached by areolar tissue to the left kidney near its outer border, and to the fascia covering the left quadratus lumborum. As low as the level of the 3rd lumbar vertebra it is in relation to the outer border of the quadratus, but from that level to the ilium the quadratus muscle lies be- hind the descending colon. Owing to its posi tion, and the absence of a peritoneal covering posteriorly, the surgeon opens into this segment of the bowel when he wishes to form an artiflcial anus. The Sigmoid Flexure of the Colon connects the de- scending colon with the rectum. It lies in the left iliac fossa, but as the sigmoid meso-colon, which forms its peri- toneal attachment, is of some length, it is freely movable, and not unfrequently hangs into the pelvis, or even extends across into the right iliac fossa. The Rectum is the terminal segment of the large intes- tine, and extends from the sigmoid flexure to the orifice of the anus. It occupies the cavity of the pelvis. It com- mences opposite the left sacro-iliac joint, and passes at first

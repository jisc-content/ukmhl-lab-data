806 ANATOMY. posterior border gives attacbment to the epididymis, which is the convoluted commencement of the vas deferens. The epididymis consists of an upper end, the globus major, or head of the epididymis ; a lower end, or globus minor, and an intermediate part, the body of the epi- didymis. From the globus minor the vas deferens pro- ceeds. The epididymis is to a large extent covered by the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis, but at its upper and lower ends it is closely united to the testicle. Be- tween the globus major of the epididymis and the upper end of the testicle is a small pedunculated body, called the pedunculated hydatid of Morgagni. Structure of the Testis and Epididymis. The Testicle, in addition to its serous envelope, is invested by a dense fibrous coat, the tunica albuginea, which gives oflf along the posterior border of the gland a strong prolongation into its interior, named the corpus Highmorianum or mediastinum testis. But, in addition, slender processes arise, generally from the inner surface of the tunica albuginea, which pass inwards to the medias- tinum testis, and collectively form the septa testis. Through this arrangement the interior of the gland is divided into a number of lobular compartments, occupied by the seminal tubes. The tunica albuginea, the mediastinum testis, and the septa testis are formed of connective tissue. Kolliker states that non-striped muscular tissue occurs in the tunica along its posterior border, and in the septa testis. Blood-vessels, continuous with the spermatic artery and veins, are also distributed over its inner surface.

PLACENTA. 869 the amnion, which is covered therefore, in whole or in part, by the wall of the sac of the allantois. As a conse- quence of this arrangement, the bag of the amnion in these mammals is altogether, or in great part, separated from the inner surface of the permanent chorion. So large and persistent is the sac of the allantois in the ordinary Kuminantia, in the Camelidse, Tragulidse, Soli- peda, and cloven-hoofed Pachydermata,^that M. H. Milne- Edwards has grouped them together as Megallantoids ; whilst he has placed the Carnivora and Pinnipedia, from the smaller size of the sac of the allantois, in a Mesallan- toid legion of mammals. The Rodentia, Insectivora, Chei- roptera, Quadrumana, and Man are characterised by the small size of the sac of the allantois, or even by its com- plete disappearance as an independent chamber: hence Milne Edwards has grouped them together in a Micrallan- toid legion. The disappearance of the allantois as a dis- tinct sac is correlated with the great expansion of the amnion, and increase in the amount of amniotic fluid. As the bag of the amnion expands it grows outwards towards the chorion, and in the Sloths, the Apes, and the Human Female, reaches, and adheres, through the intermediation of a gelatinous connective tissue, to the inner surface of that membrane, so that when the chorion is cut through, the amnion is at once exposed. The chorion is the most external of the foetal membranes. When first formed, it is globular or ovoid in shape. In uniparous mammals, as the Sloths, the Apes, and the Human Female, where the uterus is single, it preserves, with but little alteration, this form throughout intra-uterine life; but in most uniparous mammals, where the uterus

ANATOMY. 590 Its upper border slopes from behind downwards and for- wards, and possesses a pair of articular facets pos- teriorly for the two ary- tenoid cartilages; whilst in front of these facets it gives attachment to the crico-thyroid membrane and lateral crico-arytenoid muscle. The cricoid cartilage is connected to the thyroid by a pair of crico-thyroid joints and the crico-thyroid membrane.

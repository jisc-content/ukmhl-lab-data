Each vas afferens, invested by its sheath of connective tissue, passes to a Bowman’s capsule in its immediate neighbourhood, the wall of which it appears to perforate at one pole. It divides in the capsule into from four to eight branches, which subdivide into capillaries, and form a vascular, tuft or glomerulus, called the Malpighian tuft, situated opposite to the junction of the capsule with the urinary tubule. From the capillaries of the tuft a vessel arises, which Fis 222-Section through the cortex of the kidney.

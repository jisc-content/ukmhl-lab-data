433 PARIETAL BRANCHES OF THE AORTA. peritoneum. On the one hand, it communicates with the perforating branches of the renal arteries and with slender branches of the capsular, spermatic, colic, and pancreatic arteries, and in the region of the diaphragm with the capsular branches of the hepatic artery. On the other hand, it communicates with the phrenic arteries, the lower intercostals, the lumbar branches of the aorta, and with the ilio-lumbar, circumflex iliac, and epigastric branches of the iliac arteries, which also go to the wall of the abdomen. In the pelvis also the visceral superior hsemorrhoidal artery anastomoses with the middle and lateral sacral arteries. The extra-peritoneal plexus supplies the gangliated cord of the sympathetic and the fat and lymphatic glands lying outside the peritoneum, and it also gives origin to vasa vasorum for the coats of the aorta and vena cava. This plexus may, when the visceral branches of the aorta are obstructed, aid in an important manner in carrying on the circulation. In a subject examined by J. Chiene, in the dissecting-room of the University of Edinburgh, where the cceliac axis and the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries were obliterated at their origins, the blood flowed from the parietal arteries, into these visceral arteries and the viscera they supplied, through a great enlargement of the arteries of the extra-peritoneal plexus. In the thoracic cavity a similar plexus, which I have named the extra- pleural plexus, lies between the pleura and pericardium; it communicates, on the one hand, with the phrenic and mediastinal branches of the internal mammary arteries, and on the other passes in front of the root of the lung to join the bronchial system of-vessels. Another portion of this plexus joins, on the one hand, the intercostal arteries

ANATOMY. 694 branch at their deeper end: they have been called tlie mucous glands. They are lined by a columnar epithelium, the cells of which at the deeper end of the gland are more cubical in form, and have a clouded granular appear- ance. The other kind of gland is situated in the remain- ing part of the gastric mucous membrane, and consists of tubes which divide usually into four branches ; they have been named the peptic glands. The cellular lining of these peptic glands closely corre- sponds with the dimorphous arrangement in the human stomach already referred to. The twu) forms of cells in the branched part of the gland were first observed/ by Kolliker in the dog, and have since been specially studied by Heidenhain, Rollett, and Frey. According to the last two observers, the axial layer of cells is absent in a certain extent of the gland tube, below the place where the columnar epithelium Fig. 187.—Vertical section i n i t • throiiKh the Gastric mucous ccases, and the Cellular lining membrane of a cat, to show . i r . • thetubularpepticg lands, c, COnSlstS merely 01 a coiitinuous columnar epitlielium near the • n t gland mouth i p, peptic cells; layer of jieptic cells.

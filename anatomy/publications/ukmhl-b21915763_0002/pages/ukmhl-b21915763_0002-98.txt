ANATOMY. 478 from the femoral artery may be arranged according to their distribution as follows :â€” Is^. To glands, fat, and skin of groin : superficial pudic, epigastric and circumflex iliac arteries. 2cZ. To muscles : muscular branches, profunda artery. 2)d. To bone : nutrient artery. Uh. To hip joint: external and internal circumflex arteries. bth. To knee joint: anastomotic and descending branch of external circumflex artery. The profunda artery with its branches is the great muscu- lar artery of the thigh. Occasionally in the upper limb an ar- rangement similar to the profunda in the thigh occurs, when the circumflex, subscapular, superior and inferior profunda arteries arise by a common trunk from the axillary artery. By some descriptive writers the part of the femoral prior to the origin of the profunda is called comnion femoral ; which is then said to divide into a superficial femoral and a deep femoral artery, the deep femoral being looked upon therefore as a terminal branch of bifurcation, and not as a large collateral branch. The Popliteal artery is the direct continuation of the femoral artery; it commences at the opening in the ad- ductor magnus, passes down the popliteal space, or ham, as far as its inferior angle, and reaches the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it divides into two ter- minal branches, the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. It lies immediately behind the back of the lower end of the femur, the posterior ligament of the knee joint, and the popliteus muscle, so that it is in close relation to the floor of the popliteal space, and is separated from the surface of

SMALL INTESTINE. 703 ileum, aud to their presence is due the velvety appearance of the mucous surface. They are nob found elsewhere than in the small intestine. As they are the parts of the mucous membrane directly concerned in the absorption of the chyle, their structure is interesting and important. Each villus is invested by a cap of epithelium continuous with the general epithelial covering of the mucous mem- brane. The epithelium con- sists of a single layer of columnar cells, compactly ar- ranged side by side. The deep attached end of the cell is frequently attenuated into a slender filament. The broad free end, as was first figured by Goodsir, possesses a border distinct from the general body of the cell.

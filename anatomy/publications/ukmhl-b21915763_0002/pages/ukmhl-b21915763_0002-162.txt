By Virchow and others it has been thought that the connective tissue corpuscles are continuous with the lymph capillaries, and these also have been named juice canals. In some localities, as around the sobtaiy and Beyer’s glands, as well as around the glands of Brunner and other, acinous glands, the lymph capillaries at their origin have not the form of cylindrical tubes, but are dilated into irregularly-shaped spaces, lined by an endothelium. Around the arteries of the pia mater, both external to and in the substance of the brain and spinal cord, are situated lymph- spaces, in the form of hollow cylinders, and termed the peri-vascular canals; and a similar arrangement has been seen around the small vessels at the border of the cornea. In the sub-endothelial tissue of the serous membranes a close network of lymph capQlaries is situated, which, as Kecklinghausen pointed out, communicate with the serous cavity through small open- ings, or stomata, on its sur- face. These openings, as has already been described (p. 140), are surrounded by Fio. 145.—Endotlielial cells from the . . , peritoneal serous membruno.

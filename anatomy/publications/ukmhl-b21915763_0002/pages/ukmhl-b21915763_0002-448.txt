ANATOMY. 828 follicle, and the inner part of the wall is not so strongly fibrous as that which lies next the surrounding stroma. The inner surface of the wall of the sac is lined by some layers of cells which constitute the memhrana granulosa, nr so-called epithelium of the Graafian follicle. 1'hese Fig. 227â€”Section through the cortical part ot the Ovaiy; e, surface epithelium; s, s, ovarian stroma; 1, 1, large-sized Graafian follicles ; 2, 2, middle sized, and 3, 3, smaller sized Graafian follicles; o, ovum within Graafian follicle ; V, V, blood-vessels in the stroma; g, cells of memhrana granulosa. cells are columnar, and possess elliptic nuclei : they have no cell wall, and are very delicate and soft in texture. At one spot they form a little mass called the (iiLmulus, or discus proligerus, in which the ovum is im- bedded. The Graafian follicle contains some liquid, secreted doubtless through the agency of these cells, and, as the secretion accumulates, the follicle approaches the

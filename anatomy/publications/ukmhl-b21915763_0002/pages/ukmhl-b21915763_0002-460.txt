840 ANATOMY. Fallopian tubes, are generally thinner. The body of the uterus is hollowed out into a triangular cavity, which communicates at its base with the Fallopian tubes. The base of the triangular cavity is at the uterine fundus, the opposite end is at the cervix, where it communicates with the canal in the cervix by a circular constricted opening, named the os uteri internum. The cavity of the cervix is elongated and somewhat fusiform. The aperture of communication between the cervix and the vagina is transversely elongated, and named the os uteri externum. The os externum is bounded by two thick lips, the pos- terior of which is longer than the anterior, because the posterior wall of the vagina is prolonged higher on the uterus than is the anterior wall. From the oblique direc- tion of the uterus, the anterior lip reaches lower down in the vagina than the posterior lip. Structure of the Uterus. The uterus possesses three^ coats, a serous, a muscular, and a mucous. The serous, or external coat, covers the posterior surface of the neck and body, the fundus, the anterior surface of the body, but not the anterior surface of the neck of the uterus : it is also prolonged from the back of the cervix uteri on that part of the posterior wall of the vagina, which lies behind the posterior lip of the os uteri. It is reflected from the sides of the uterus, as the broad ligaments, which are prolonged to the sides of the pelvis : in front it is reflected to the bladder as the two utero-vesical folds, whilst behind it is reflected to the rectum as the two utero-rectal folds of

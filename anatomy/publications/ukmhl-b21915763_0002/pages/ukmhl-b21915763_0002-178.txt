558 ANATOMY. trabecles of this framework, possess a similar fibro- elastic and muscular structure to that of the fibrous coat. The blood-vessels ramify in the interior of the spleen in close relation to the trabecles. The intervals between the trabecles are irregular in form and size, and are occupied by a soft reddish substance, the spleen pulp. If a section be made through the spleen, and’ a current of water be directed on the surface of the section, the spleen pulp is easily washed out of these inter- vals, and the trabecular framework is left. The examination of the more minute structure of the spleen is attended with many difficulties, more especially as regards the mode of ter- mination of the splenic artery, the commencement of the vein, and the relation of the splenic blood-vessels to the spleen pulp. When the pulp is examined micro- scopically, it is seen to contain fine blood-vessels, spheroidal bodies called the Malpighian corpuscles, nu- merous cells, and a delicate reticulum of connective tissue. By one set of ob- servers, as W. Miiller and Frey, it is believed that the blood in passing from the splenic artery into the splenic vein flows into channels, which have no continuous tvibular walls, so that it comes ' Fig. 154.—The trabecular framework t, t. of the Spleen after the spleen pulp has been washed out; c, c, the fibrous coat seen in section.

PULMONAEY VEINS. 501 They are absent in the veins of the lungs, of the brain, in the venae cavae and hepatic vein, and in the veins of several of the abdominal viscera. Some of the veins lie in the subcutaneous fat, and are called superficial veins, others lie amidst the muscles, and form the deep veins. The deep veins usually accompany the arteries, and are named after them; in many localities an artery is accompanied by two veins, termed its venae comites. Some of the deep veins, as the cranial venous sinuses, do not however run along with arteries. The superficial veins do not accompany arteries. Frequent anastomoses take place between the superficial and deep veins. The veins are arranged primarily into two groupsâ€”the Pulmonary veins and the Systemic veins. PULMONARY GROUP OP VEINS. The pulmonary group of veins consists of the veins which convey the arterial blood from the lungs to the left auricle of the heart. Two Pulmonary veins are formed in each lung by the coalescence of the venous radicles, which arise from the pulmonary capillary plexus. They run to the root of the lung, where they are placed anterior to the pulmonary artery and bronchial tube, and end by opening into the back of the left auricle. The pulmonary veins anastomose with each other in the substance of the lung. They are devoid of valves, and do not possess a greater capacity than the pulmonary arteries.

846 ANATOMY. and lie in close relation to the muscular fasciculi. They freely communicate with each other and give rise to the uterine and ovarian plexuses of veins. During pregnancy the veins within the muscular coat increase greatly in ske, and form a cavernous-looking arrangement in the muscular wall. Lymphatic vessels form a network in the muscular wall, from which larger lymphatics proceed, that pass be- tween the layers of the broad ligaments. From the observa- tions of Leopold, it would appear that lymph spaces exist between the bundles of connective tissue of the mucosa, the walls of which spaces are formed of the flattened en- dothelial cells investing those bundles, and that similar endothelial sheaths invest the glands and blood-vessels. The nerves of the uterus arise from the hypogastric and spermatic plexuses of the sympathetic, and from the 3rd and 4th sacral nerves. Their arrangement and distribu- tion have been investigated by Tiedemann, Robert Lee, Snow Beck, and Frankenhauser. They form numerous plexuses, in which both medullated and non-medullated nerve flbres and nerve ceUs are found. They are distri- buted in the muscular wall, and Frankenhauser states that the flbres can be traced into the nuclei of the contractile muscular fibre-cells. By some authors the nerves are said to increase in size during pregnancy.

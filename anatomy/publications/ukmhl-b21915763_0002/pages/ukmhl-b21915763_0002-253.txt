633 STRUCTURE OF LUNGS. Fio.. 172.â€”Portion of the Lunft of a foeta ciilf, to show the division into Lobules. At the right horder.of the figure the indi- vidual lobules have been separated from each other. Natural size. tlie lohnles of the lung. These lobules are uot limited to the surface, but are found in great numbers throughout its entire substance, where they are so closely packed together that their boundaries are indistinct. The lung may therefore be regarded as built up of many thousands of lobules. In the human foetus, but more readily in foetal sheep and calves, the lobules may be teased asunder without much difficulty, by tearing through the intermediate connective tissue. In the adult lung they are more closely united to- gether, but their boundaries are often rendered distinct by the formation of pigment in the intermediate connective tissue. The lobules are about the size of peas; they are irregulaAy pear-shaped, the broader end being directed towards the surface of the lung, whilst the narrow end receives a terminal branch from the bronchial tube. The coniuctive tissue of the lung not only separates the lobules from each other, but forms a layer beneath the pulmonic pleura, which is on the one hand continuous with the interlobular connective tissue, and on the other with the sub-endothelial connective tissue of the pleura. Con- nective tissue also surrounds the bronchus and blood- vessels at the root of the lung, and is prolonged along with the Vessels and bronchus, as their tunica adventitia, into the substance of the organ, where it becomes continuous vdth the interlobular connective tissue. The interlobular

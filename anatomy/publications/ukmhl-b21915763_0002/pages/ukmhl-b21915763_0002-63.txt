443 AXILLARY ARTERY. following branches j acromial thoracic, which passes out- wards to the deltoid and the region of the acromion : humeral thoracic, which descends, at the side of the cephalic vein, between the deltoid and greater pectoral muscles to which it gives branches: pectoral thoracic, which supplies the two pectoral muscles: clavicular thwacic, which supplies the subclavius muscle. c. Long Thoracic, or External Mammary, runs parallel to the lower border of the lesser pectoral muscle to the lateral wall of the chest, and in woman supplies the mammary gland. d. Alar Thoracic, a short branch to the fat and lym- phatic glands of the axOla: it sometimes arises from the subscapular or long thoracic arteries. e. Subscapular arises opposite the lower border of the subscapularis, along which it runs to the inferior angle of the scapula and lateral waU of the chest j it supplies the serratus magnus and the muscles of the posterior wall of the axilla : it gives off a large dorsal branch, which turns round the axillary border of the scapula, in the triangular space bounded by the teres minor, teres major, and long head of the triceps, which branch ramifies on the dorsum of the scapula to supply the teres minor and infra-spinatus. /. Anterior Circumflex, a small branch, which runs out- wards in front of the humerus to the bicipital groove, where it sends a branch along with the tendon of tlie biceps to the shoulder joint, and terminates in the deltoid muscle. g. Posterior Circumflex, a large branch, which winds round the back of the humerus, along with the circumflex nerve, in the quadrilateral space bounded by the teres minor, teres major, long head of the triceps and shaft o[

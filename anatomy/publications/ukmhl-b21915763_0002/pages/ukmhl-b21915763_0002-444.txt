ANATOMY. 824 penis. These arteries branch, and the branches for the most part end in capillaries, which open into the inter- trabecular venous compartments, but in the bulb helicine arteries are found. Veins arise in the corpus spongiosum, some of which join the dorsal vein, whilst others form veins corresponding to the arteries of the bulb. The distinctive character of the corpus spongiosum is the presence of the urethra in it. The spongy part of the urethra is about six inches long. It is continuous behind with the membranous part, and when it enters the bulb presents a dilatation. In front of the bulb the urethra diminishes in calibre, and remains of uniform diameter until it enters the glans penis, when it again dilates into the fossa navicularis. The fossa terminates anteriorly at the constricted orifice at the end of the glans. The urethra, as seen in transverse section through the body of the corpus spongiosum, is widest transversely; in the fossa navicularis it is widest vertically, which is also its greatest diameter at the external orifice. The mucous lining is covered, except near the orifice, bj’ columnar epithelium, and opening on its surface are the ducts of numerous small racemose glands. Depressions or lacunse also open on its surface, one situated in the roof of the fossa navicularis, and named the lacuna magna, being most conspicuous. External to the mucous membrane is a layer of non-striped muscle, together with a venous plexus. The penis is well provided with lymphatics, which form networks in the glans, the prepuce, and around the mucous membrane of the ui’ethra. They communicate with the inguinal glands in the groin.

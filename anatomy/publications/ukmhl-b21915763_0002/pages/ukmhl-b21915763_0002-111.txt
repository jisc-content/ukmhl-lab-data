491 INOSCULATIONS IN LOWER LIMB. equally small proportion from the external iliac artery. Its origin from the epigastric is due to a great increase in the size of the pubic branch of that artery. When the obturator arises from the epigastric it enters the pelvis behind its pubic wall, and in its course passes usually to the outer side of, more seldom to the front and inner side of the crural ring ; a point to be kept in mind in connec tion with the anatomy of the parts concerned in femoral hernia. Important anastomoses take place not only between branches belonging to the ihac system of arteries, but between some of these branches and those of other arte- ries. In the wall of the abdomen, as already described, the deep epigastric and circumflex iliac of the external iliac, and the ilio-lumbar of the internal iliac, anastomose with the internal mammary of the subclavian, and with the lower in- tercostal and lumbar branches of the aorta. At the sacral wall of the pelvis, the lateral sacral of the internal iliac anastomoses with the middle sacral of' the aorta, and with the superior haemorrhoidal termination of the inferior mesenteric artery. At the anterior wall of the pelvis behind the os pubis, the pubic branch of the deep epi- gastric anastomoses with the pubic branch of the obturator. In the lower limb the following inosculations take place around the hip joint: in the buttock and region of the trochanter major the gluteal and sciatic branches of the in- ternal diac with the external and internal circumflex branches of the profunda; in the region of the trochanter minor the obturator of the internal iliac with the internal circumflex of the profunda.

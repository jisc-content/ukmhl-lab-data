416 ANATOMY. PULMONARY GROUP OF ARTERIES. The pulmonary group of arteries consists of the trunk of the pulmonary artery and of its branches. (Fig. 116, f. 11, 15.) The TRUNK of the PULMONARY ARTERY arises ' from the conus arteriosus of the right ventricle. It is about two inches long, and passes upwards, backwards, and to the left as high as the level of the second left costal cartilage, when it divides into the right and left pulmonary branches. In its course it lies at first in front of the origin of the aorta, and then passes to the left of the ascending part of the aortic arch, to bifurcate into its two terminal branches immediately below the transverse part of the arch. It is attached to the aorta by areolar tissue, and the two are invested by a common envelope of the serous layer of the pericardium. The Right Pulmonary artery passes to the right almost transversely behind the ascending aorta and the superior vena cava to the root of the right lung, where it lies between the right pulmonary vein and the bronchial tube. The Left Pulmonary artery is shorter than the right. It runs in front of the descending aorta to the root of the left lung, where it lies above the bronchus and pulmonary vein. A fibrous cord, the remains of the ductus arte- riosus, is attached on the one hand to the left pulmonary arteiy close to its origin, and on the other to the lower surface of the transverse part of the aortic arch. In the foetus the ductus arteriosus is a short wide vessel, which conveys blood directly from the pulmonary artery into the aorta. After the birth of the child it is no longer required,

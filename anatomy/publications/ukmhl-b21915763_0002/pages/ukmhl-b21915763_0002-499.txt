PLACENTA. 879 the utero-placental veins may be injected from it. The spaces in the interior of the placenta for the transmis- sion of the maternal blood have been variously termed the cavernous spaces, the placental sinuses or lacunm, the cells of the placenta, the intervillal spaces, and the placental bag or sac; they freely communicate with each other, not only in the same lobe, but in adjacent lobes, through imperfections in the interlobular dissepiments. These spaces belong to the maternal vascular system, and they are obviously an expansion of the dilated capillaries to be seen in the decidua serotina as early as the first month of gestation. Owing to the expansion of the intra-placental maternal capillaries into these irregular sinuses, a thinning and expansion of the vascular wall has at the same time taken place, so that it cannot, as a rule, be recognised as a distinct layer bounding tlie maternal sinus; but one may sometimes see a layer of great delicacy on the exterior of the villus, between its cellular covering, already described, and the maternal blood space, which from its position represents the wall of the intra-placental maternal vessels. As to the cellular investment of the villus, at first sight it may appear to be only its proper epithelial covering- derived from the outer epithelial layer of the chorion. But the cells are not squamous; they differ therefore from the epithelial covering of the chorion, and can readily be stripped off the villi. I am of opinion that they are de- rived from the intra-placental prolongations of the decidua. Through the expansion of the maternal sinuses, the cells of the decidua, situated superficially to the dilated capillaries, have been pressed so closely to the villi as to become incor- porated with them, and apparently to form a part of their

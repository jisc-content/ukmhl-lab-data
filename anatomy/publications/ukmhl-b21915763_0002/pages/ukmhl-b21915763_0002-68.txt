448 ANATOMY. fore arm, lying on the interosseous membrane, and between the flexor longus pollicis and flexor profundus digitorum muscles, as far as the pronator quadratus muscle, when it divides into two terminal branches—one to reach the front of the carpus, the other and larger pierces the interosseous membrane to reach the back of the carpus. It is accom- panied, when in front of the interosseous membrane, by the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve. It supplies muscular branches to the deep muscles of the fore arm; a median branch, which is occasionally an artery of considerable sixe, accompanies and supplies the median nerve, and descends with it to the palm of the hand; nutrient branches, to enter the foramina in the shafts of the radius and ulna. The joosierio?’ interosseous artery passes backwards through the interos- seous space, and between the supinator brevis and extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis muscles to supply the muscles on the back of the fore arm ; it giVfes off the posterior interosseous recurrent branch, which ascends under cover of the anconeus to the internal between the outer condyle and the olecranon. d. Muscular branches to muscles of fore arm. e. Posterior Ulnar Carpal, a small and inconstant branch, arises opposite the wunst, and forms an arch with the posterior radial carpal on the back of the carpus, and supplies the articulations. /. Anterior Ulnar Carped, also small and inconstant, is covered by the flexor tendons, and forms an arch with the anterior radial carpal on the front of the carpus, the arti- culations of which it supplies.

423 VISCEEAL BKANCHES OF THE AOKTA. The (Esophageal arteries, four or five in number, arise from the descending thoracic aorta, and supply the coats of the oesophagus. The Pericardial branches are very small arteries, vt^hich arise either from the descending thoracic aorta or the oeso- phageal arteries, and supply the back of the bag of the pericardium, and the lymphatic glands and loose tissue of the posterior mediastinum. The branches of the aorta which supply the Viscera of the Abdomen proper arise either singly or in pairs. The single arteries are the coeliac axis, the superior mesenteric, and the inferior mesenteric, which arise from the front of the abdominal aorta; the pairs are the two capsular, the two renal, and the two spermatic or ovarian, which ari^e from its sides. The single arteries supply viscera, which are either completely or almost completely invested by the peritoneum, and the veins corresponding to them are the roots of the vena portte. The pairs of arteries supply viscera developed behind the peritoneum, and the veins corresponding to them are rootlets of the inferior vena cava. The CiELiAC Axis is the first visceral branch of the abdominal aorta. It arises from the front of that vessel between the two pdlars of the diaphragm, above the pancreas, and is surrounded by the solar plexus of the sympathetic. It is a thick, short artery, which almost immediately divides into the coronary, hepatic, and splenic branches. The Coronaria veniriculi artery is the smallest branch, and passes upwards and to the left to the cardiac orifice of the stomach, where it subdivides into an amphageal branch

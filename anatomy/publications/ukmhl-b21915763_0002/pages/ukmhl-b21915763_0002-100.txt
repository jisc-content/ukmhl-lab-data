480 ANATOMY. internal tuberosity of the tibia and under cover of the internal lateral ligament to the inner side of the knee. /. Inferior External Articular runs outwards under the outer head of the gastrocnemius and the external lateral ligament, and above the head of the fibula to the outer side of the knee. q. Azygos Articular pierces the posterior hgament of the knee, and is distributed to the crucial ligaments and synovial membrane. li. Cutaneous branch or branches arise either from the popliteal or from its muscular arteries to supply the skin of the popliteal space and calf of the leg. The Antekior Tibiae artery is the smaller of the two terminal branches of the popliteal. It passes at first directly forwards between the tibia and fibula, then descends on the front of the leg as far as the front of the ankle, where it becomes the dorsal arteiy of the foot. As it passes forwards it lies above the upper end of the tibialis posticus and the interosseous membraue. On the front of the leg it rests on the front of the interosseous membrane for about its upper two-thirds, but for the rest of its course on the front of the tibia. In the upper part of the leg it is deeply placed between the muscles, with the tibialis anticus on its inner side, and the extensor communis digitorum and extensor longus hallucis on its outer side. Above the ankle, where it rests on the tibia, it is covered by the anterior annular ligament of the fascia of the leg, and is crossed by the tendon of the extensor longus ’hallucis. It is accompanied by the two venae comites, and the anterior tibial nerve lies in close relation to it. Its branches are as follows ;— _.

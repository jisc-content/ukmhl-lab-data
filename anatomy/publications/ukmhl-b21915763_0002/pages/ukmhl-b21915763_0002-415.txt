795 PELVIC FASCIA. It also extends to tlie apex of tlie bladder, where it is re- flected to the anterior wall of the abdomen, along the line of the urachus, as the superior or false ligament. The anterior surface of the bladder is not covered by the peri- toneum, so that when the bladder rises above the pubes it can be opened without injuring that membrane. The cervix likewise has no relation to the peritoneum. The absence of a peritoneal covering, on the anterior part of the base of the bladder, enables the surgeon to puncture the bladder from the rectum without injuring the serous membrane. The Pelvic Fascia gives rise to the true ligaments of the bladder. As this important fascia is intimately related, not only to the bladder, but to all the other pelvic viscera, it will be advisable to examine its arrangement generally. The pelvic fascia is attached to each side of the pelvic brim, and to the back of the bodies of the pubic bones; it descends into the pelvis on the inner surface of the internal obturator muscle, is prolonged downwards as far as the spine and tuberosity of the ischium, to both of which it is attached, and is often called the obturator fascia. Be- hind the spine of the ischium the fascia is prolonged backwards as a thin membrane on the anterior aspect of the pyriformis muscle, sacral plexus of nerves, and great sciatic foramen. It lies behind the internal iliac artery and its branches, and is pierced by the gluteal, sciatic, and pudic arteries in their course to the great sciatic foramen. From the relation of this part of the fascia to the anterior, lateral, and posterior part of the pelvic wall, it may appropriately be called the parietal division of the pelvic fascia. On a line with the spine of the ischium and the back of

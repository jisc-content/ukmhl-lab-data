ANATOMY, 740 fossa for the vena cava and the fissure for the umbilical vein. They anastomose freely with each other in these localities, and have blind terminations; they are not sur- rounded by hepatic lobules. They are lined by columnar epithelium. The lymphatics of the liver form a superficial and a deep set. The superficial set ramifies beneath the serous coat, where it forms a network. Each capsular branch of the hepatic artery is, according to T. A. Carter, accom- panied by a pair of lymphatics, which are connected together at intervals by short transverse branches, so that the artery is moreâ€™ or less ensheathed by lymphatics. The deep lymphatics accompany the portal vein and hepatic artery as far as the intervals between the lobules, where they form interlobular lymphatics, which, like the corresponding branches of the portal vein, run around the lobule. Carter has traced into the lobule towards its centre minute branches of the interlobular lymphatics; Macgillavry considers that the intra-lobular capillaries are surrounded by lymph spaces; A. Budge has injected lymph-vessels in the wall of the central vein of the hepatic lobules, and Kolliker has observed lymphatics surrounding the hepatic vein. Kisselew has described lymph-follicles in relation to the interlobular lymphatics of the pig. The nerves of the liver arise from the coeliac plexus of the sympathetic and from the left pneumogastric. They accompany the portal vessels in their distribution, and supply the muscular coats of the vessels. According to Pfliiger, nerves may be traced to the secreting cells within the lobules. The obliterated umbilical vein, to which reference has

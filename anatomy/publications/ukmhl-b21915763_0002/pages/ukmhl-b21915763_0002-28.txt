ANATOMY. 408 cavae and pulmunary veins, whilst fibres extend longitu- dinally and obliquely along the waU of the coronary venous sinus. The superficial stratum consists of fasciculi, which run obliquely from one auricle to the other on both the anterior and posterior surfaces, and are said to be prolonged into the auricular septum. The muscular waU of the ventricles is much thicker than that of the auricles, and the waU of the left ventricle is about three times thicker than the right. The fibres vary in their direction in different parts of the thickness of the ventricular walls. The superficial external fibres run on the anterior surface of the ventricles obliquely from above downwards, and from right to left, and dip into the anterior ventricular groove to enter the septum, whilst on the posterior surface they extend across the posterior ven- tricular 'groove. At the apex of the heart they turn inwards in a whorl-like manner, and, as was known to Lower and Gerdy, become continuous with superficial fibres on the inner wall of the ventricle. At the base of the ventricles, some of the superficial external fibres are attached to the auriculo-ventricular and arterial rings, but the greater number turn round the border of the auriculo- ventricular openings, and, as Pettigrew has shown, become continuous with the superficial internal fibres, which run ob- liquely in the reverse direction. The internal fibres are also prolonged into the musculi papiUares, the chordm tendineae springing from which serve therefore as tendons of inser- tion of these muscles. Deeper in the substance of the wall the fibres are arranged in different degrees of obliquity, and about the centre of the thickness of the wall are seen to lie in the horizontal plane.

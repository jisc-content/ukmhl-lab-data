THE HEAET. 399 apex, an anterior and aâ€™posterior surface, a right and left border. The base lies backwards, upwards, and to the right, opposite the 4th to the 8th dorsal vertebrae. The apex is directed downwards, forwards, and to the left, opposite to the interval between the 5th and 6th left ribs, where it comes into relation with the anterior wall of the chest about IJ inch below the nipple, and inches from the middle line of the sternum. The anterior surface is convex, and in relation to the back of the lower half of the sternum, of the 3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th left costal carti- lages, and the 3d, 4th, and 5th right costal cartileges. The pleurae and lungs overlap this surface of the heart, being separated from it by the pericardium. The posterior surface is flattened, and in relation to the diaphragm. The right border is thin when compared with the left border, which is shorter and more rounded. About two-thirds of the heart are situated to the left of the mesial plane of the thoracic cavity. The outer surface of the heart is marked by grooves, which indicate externally its division internally into four chambers or cavities. One of these grooves, called the auriculo-ventricular groove, runs around the heart, both on the anterior and posterior surfaces, from border to border, and marks off the two auricles from the two ventricles. This groove is more distinct on the back than on the front of the heart, for it is concealed anteriorly by the origins of the aorta and the pulmonary artery. Two longitudinal grooves extend from the base to the apex of the heart, one on the anterior surface, the other on the posterior. They indicate the separation of the heart into a right and left portion or side. The right side consists of the right auricle and right ventricle, the left side of the left auricle

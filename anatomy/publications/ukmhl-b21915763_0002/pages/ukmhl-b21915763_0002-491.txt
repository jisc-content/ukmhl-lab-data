PLACENTA.. 871 by their margins, so that they form a continuous layer. This layer of cells can be peeled off the villus, and be- longs, as was stated by Goodsir, to the cellular structure of the decidua, which has become adherent to the villi in the course of the development of the placenta. The Maternal Placenta is formed by a special modi- fication of the uterine mucous membrane. When the fertilised ovum is received into the cavity of the uterus the mucosa undergoes important changes. It swells up, becomes thicker, softer, and more vascular. Its epithelial covering loses its columnar form; its glands enlarge, and their orifices become more distinct; the inter- glandular tissue increases largely and rapidly in quantity, by a multiplication, not only of the cells of the surface- epithelium, but by a proliferation of the corpuscles of the sub-epithelial connective tissue, so that the glands are separated from each other by a much greater amount of interglandular tissue than in the non-gravid state ; the blood-vessels not only increase in numbers but in size. At the same time the free surface of the modified mucosa becomes divided into a number of irregular areas by fur- rows, and on the free surface of these areas, more espe- cially near the furrows, the mouths of''the utricular glands may be seen to open in considerable numbers. The modi- fied mucosa constitutes the decidua vera or iiterina. The fertilized ovum attaches itself to the surface of one of these areas; and the decidua, immediately surrounding the place of attachment, grows around the ovum so as to enclose it and to form the decidua reflexa or decidua ovuli; the place of junction of the decidua, growing up from opposite sides of the attached border of the ovum beinÂ°- ^ O

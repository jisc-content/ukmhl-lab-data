716 ANATOMY. obliquely downwards and to the right until it reaches the middle line of the sacrum; secondly, it closely follows the curvature of the sacrum and coccyx, lying in relation to their anterior surface; thirdly, when it reaches the tip of the coccyx its terminal or third part inclines downwards and backwards for about one inch and a half to the anal orifice. The upper end, or first part of the rectum, is invested by peritoneum, and is attached to the front of the sacrum as far down as its 2nd or 3rd vertebra by the peritoneal fold, termed meso-rectum. The second part extends from the 2nd or 3rd sacral vertebra to the tip of the coccyx, is attached to the bone by areolar tissue, and is in relation also to the pelvic fascia. The peritoneum does not form a complete investment for the second part of the rectum; at first it covers it anteriorly and laterally, lower down only ante- riorly, and stiU lower it leaves it, to be reflected, in the male on the back of the bladder, in the female on the back of the vagina. The third part of the rectum is in relation to the pelvic fascia and the levatores ani muscles, by which parts it is supported and retained in position. In the male the bladder, vesiculaa seminales, and prostate gland are in front of the rectum; but in the female its anterior surface is in relation to the uterus and vagina, to the latter of which it is intimately connected. The anus opens on the surface of the middle line of the perineum, midway between the two ischial tuberosities, and the skin surrounding the orifice is thin and wrinkled when the open- ing is closed. Immediately beneath the skin is the sphincter ani extemus muscle, which forms a thin layer of fasciculi, arranged in a series of ellipses around the orifice. It is attached behind to the tip of the coccyx, surrounds the

ANATOMY. 540 cular fibre. The middle coat is formed of circularly- arranged non-striped muscular fibre, intermingled witli elastic fibres. The inner coat consists on its free surface of a layer of elongated, flattened, endothelial cells, outside which is a layer of elastic fibres arranged longitudinally. The valves of the lymphatics are simple folds of the inner coat. They usually consist of two semilunar segments, lying side by side. They occur much more frequently than in the veins, and as the wall of the lymphatic has a slight sinus or bulging opposite each valve, the vessel, when distended, has a beaded or moniliform appearance. The Lym'ph Capillaries lie between the tissues of the organs in which they are situated. They are arranged in a network or plexiform manner, the meshes of which are polygonal. The capillary wall is formed of a single layer of elongated, flattened, endothelial cells, the outlines of which can be stained on the ad- dition of a solution of nitrate of silver. The lymph capillaries, where they pass into the larger iieneath the pei'itoneal covering of the lymph - VCSSels, difier diaplinigm. From a preparation made ^ from the blood capil- laries in possessing indications of a beaded or varicose appearance, due apparently to an imperfect valvular arrangement in the interior of the tube.

;82i PENIS. skin is the suspensory ligament, whicli forms a triangular band passing from the symphysis pubis to the dorsum of the penis. When the loose integument is removed from the penis, it is seen to consist of three longitudinal and parallel columns, the two corpora cavernosa, and the corpus spon- giosum urethrae. The corpora cavernosa are the proper erectile parts of the penis, and form its dorsum, sides, and root. In the body of the penis they are closely united together, but at its root they diverge from each other and form the crura penis, which are attached to the sides of the pubic arch in front of the triangular ligament. Each crus is attenuated at its attached end, but in front of its place of attachment it dilates into the bulb of the corpus cavernosum. On the dorsum penis is a shallow groove, which marks the line of union of the corpora caver- nosa on this aspect of the organ : on the under surface is a deep furrow, in which the corpus spongiosum is lodged. Each crus penis, and the part of the corpus cavernosum immediately continuous with it, is connected with the erector penis muscle. The erector penis, or ischio- cavernosus muscle, arises from the inner surface of the ischial tuberosity : it passes forwards in close contact with the under surface of the crus, and is inserted into the fibrous coat of the corpus cavernosum. Structure.â€”The corpora cavernosa possess a dense white coat of fibro-elastic tissue, the tunica albuginea, which is not only prolonged from one cavernous body to the other, but forms a mesial septum between the two. This septum is perforated by numerous slits, which lie parallel to each other, so as to give it a comb-like appearance, hence the

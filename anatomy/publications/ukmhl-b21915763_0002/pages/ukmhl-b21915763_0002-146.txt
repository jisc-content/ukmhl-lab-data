526 ANATOMY. Structure of the Veins. Veins, like arteries, are enclosed in a fibrous sheath. The thickness of the wall of a vein is considerably less than that of an artery of equal size. The thinness of the venous wall enables the colour of the blood to be seen through it, so that veins have a bluish-purple colour. Veins have three coats,—an outer, middle, and inner. The outer coat, or tunica adventitia, is formed by an interlacement of white and yellow elastic fibres of con- nective tissue; it possesses considerable strength, though it has no great thickness. In some veins, more especially those of the abdominal cavity, non-striped muscular fibres are found in this coat, arranged as a longitudinal network. e Fio. 142.—Stnictnre of n Minute Artery A nnd Vein V. e, external coat or adven- titia; m, transversely aiTanged muscular tissue of the middle coat.

The middle coat consists of non-striped muscular fibres, arranged transversely around the vein, and mingled with these muscular fibres are white and yellow elastic fibres of connective tissue, which mostly run in a longitudinal

SOFT PALA.TE. 667 constrictor, and enters the soft palate in the posterior part, in which it may be traced up to the mesial plane. Levatores or Azygos uvulce consist of two fasciculi, one on each side of the mesial plane of the uvula, which arise from the spine of the palate plates of the palate bones, and descend into the uvula towards its tip. Tensor or Circumjlexus palati arises from the scaphoid fossa at the root of the internal pterygoid plate, and from the outer third of the wall of the Eustachian tube : it descends in the pterygoid fossa, and ends in a tendon which hooks round the root of the hamular process, and pierces the wall of the pharynx between the pterygoid and pterygo-maxillary origins of the superior constrictor j it enters the soft palate and expands into an aponeurotic tendon, which blends in the mesial plane with that of the corresponding muscle, and is attached to the under surface of the palate plate of the palate bone. The constrictors of the fauces are as follows:â€” Palato-glossus forms, along with its fellow, a sphincter arrangement in the soft palate, anterior palatine pillars and tongue. It lies in the soft palate in close relation to the mucous membrane of the anterior surface, descends in the anterior pDlars to the sides of the root of the tongue, into the substance of which it enters. By its contraction it constricts the pharyngo-oral orifice. Palato-pharyngeus has been described on p. 662. The action of the muscles of the soft palate and pharynx in connection with the process of deglutition has been described on p, 88. From their attachment to the wall of the Eustachian tube, the tensor and levator palati muscles can, when the soft palate is fixed, act on the tube. The

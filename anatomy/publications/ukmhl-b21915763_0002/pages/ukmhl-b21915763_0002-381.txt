761 teeth. a narrow string of epithelial cells, continuous on the one hand with the epithelial lining of the mouth, and on the other with the enamel organ. This epithelial string forms the neclc of the eno/nel organ. After a tune, however, the growth of the connec- tive tissue, forming the lips of the primi- tive groove, causes the neck of the ena- mel organ to atrophy, so that all communi- cation between the Fig. 210.—Vertical section through the gum to enamel Organ and the show the formation of the Dental Papilla, e! n • -i ',.1.

Magnified, ig cut off J the con- nective tissue on the opposite lips of the 'groove becomes continuous, and the embryo tooth, being now completely enclosed in a cavity or sac, formed by the gelatinous con- nective tissue of the gum, has entered on what Goodsir termed its saccular stage of development. When enclosed in its sac the embryo tooth, though per- fectly soft, acquires a shape, which enables one to recognize to what group of teeth it belongs. After a time it begins to harden and to exhibit the characteristic tooth structure. The dental papilla is more vascular than the surrounding connective tissue, from the blood-vessels of which its vessels are derived. The papilla abounds in cells which are, in the first instance, rounded and ovoid in shape. Changes then t^e place in the cells situated at its periphery, which become elongated and branched, and form layers of cells, which Waldeyer has appropriately named odonto- 3 c

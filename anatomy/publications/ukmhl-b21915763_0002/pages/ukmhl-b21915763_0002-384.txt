They undergo a greater elongation, and form six-sided prismatic cells, which Kolliker has named the internal or enamel epithelium. The cells of the most superficial layer of the enamel organ lie in contact with the vascular connective tissue, which Fig. 213.â€”Vertical section through gum of Sheep in the region of the molar teeth. p, the papilla of a milklmolar; 1, the inner, 2, the middle, and 3, the outer layers of the enamel organ; n, tlie neck of the enamel organ; e', the superficial epithelium; ct, ct, ct, the sub-epithelial connective tissue which subsequently forms the sac of the tooth; r, the cavity of resere occupied by epithelium.

They form the external epi- thelium of the enamel organ, and slender papillary prolon- gations of the connective tissue frequently project into this epithelial layer. The cells of the enamel organ, situated between its external and its internal epithelium, become

MUSCLES OF LAEYNX. 599 The crico-thyroid muscles increase the tension of the vocal cords. As to the mode in which this tension is occasioned there is a difference of opinion. It is usu- ally believed that the crico-thyroid muscles rotate the thyroid cartilage about a transverse axis, passing horizon- tally through the two crico-thyroid joints, and de- press the anterior border of the thyroid cartilage so as to elongate the vocal cords in front. But some anatomists hold that the thyroid cartilage is fixed by the action of the thyro-hyoid muscles, that the crico-thyroid muscles then rotate the cricoid cartilage on the thyroid, by drawing the front of the cricoid cartilage upwards, which depresses the back of the cricoid and the arytenoid cartilages, and Fig. 1G6.â€”Diagram of the Rima Glottidia, to illustrate the action of the muscles on it. A transverse section has been made through the larynx on a level with the true vocal cord and the bases of the arytenoid cartilages.

In the right hand figure the rima is shown as almost closed by the action of !ca the pair of lateral arytenoids and ar, the arytenoid muscle, ta, ta, the pair of thyro-ary- tenoid muscles. In the left hand figure the rima is shown widely open by the action of pea, the pair of posterior crico-arytenoid muscles; C, the upper border of the cricoid cartilage. elongates the posterior ends of the vocal cords. The thyro- arytenoid muscles approximate the opposite ends of the vocal cords, and thus relax them, by drawing the thyroid

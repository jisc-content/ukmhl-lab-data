SaIj)vf>go-pharyngeus muscle, when present, arises from the cartilage of the Eustachian tube j its fibres descend in the postero-lateral wall of the pharynx, to be inserted along with the palato-pharyngeus. The muscular wall of the pharynx is enveloped by a fibrous membrane, the tunica pharyngis externa, which is continuous superiorly with the fibrous membrane covering the buccinator muscles. Between the muscular and mucous coats of the pharynx is the tunica pharyngis interna, which forms in the posterior wall of the nasal part of the pharynx a well-defined fibrous membrane. It is attached above to the petrous-temporal, the basi- sphenoid, and the pharyngeal tubercle of the basi- occipital. From this tubercle a slender band passes longitudinally down the middle line of the posterior wall of the pharynx and forms a common insertion for the three pairs of constrictors. As the tunica interna descends in the wall of the pharynx it becomes thinner, and is finally lost in the submucous coat. The mucous coat of the pharynx lines the canal, and is continuous through the several openings with the mucous membrane lining the Eustachian tubes, nose, mouth, larynx, and oesophagus. The epithelium covering the mucous membrane of the nasal part of the pharynx is columnar and ciliated over a considerable surface, but elsewhere the pharyngeal epi- thelium is tesselated and stratified; and in the latter localities, vascular papillae project into the epithelial

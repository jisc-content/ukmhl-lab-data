ANATOMY. 444‘ the humerus : it ends in the deltoid muscle, for which it is the principal artery of supply. The branches of the axillary artery may be arranged according to their distribution in three groups :— Is^. To walls of thorax: short thoracic, long thoracic, pectoral thoracic, terminal branches of subscapular artery. 2c?. To scapulo-humeral region : acromio-thoracic, clavi- cular thoracic, humeral thoracic, anterior and posterior circumflex, and dorsal branch of subscapular artery. • 3(?. To fat and glands of axilla : alar thoracic artery. The branches to the walls of the thorax anastomose with the superior intercostal of the subclavian, the aortic inter- costals and the anterior intercostals of the internal mam- mary. The branches to the scapulo-humeral region inos- culate with the posterior scapular aud supra-scapular branches of the subclavian. Both series of inosculations enlarge, and form secondary channels for the conveyance of blood to the upper limb, when the third part of the sub- clavian artery is tied. The Brachial orHuMER.AL artery is the direct continuation of the axillary. It commences at the lower border of the tendon of the teres major, and passes down the u^iper arm to a little below the bend of the elbow, where it divides into two terminal branches, the radial and ulnar arteries. In this course it lies at first to the inner side of the shaft of the humerus, but lower down it inclines to the front of that bone. It is covered by the skin and fascite, and at the bend of the elbow it is crossed by the thin tendon of the bicejis, which is inserted into the fascia of the fore arm. It is in relation behind to the long head of the triceps, but is separated from it by the musculo-spiral nerve

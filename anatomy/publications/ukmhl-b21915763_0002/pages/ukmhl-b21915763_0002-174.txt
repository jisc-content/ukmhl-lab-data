ANATOMY. 554 The Ductless Glands. In several part's of the body soft, vascular, glandular- looking organs are found, which differ from secreting glands in not possessing an excretory duct, and, in conse- quence of this anatomical character, have long been known as the DUCTLESS glands, or glands without ducts. The spleen, thyroid gland, thymus gland, supra-renal cap- sules, pineal gland, and pituitary body are all distinguished by this peculiarity. From recent observations on their structure and functions, it has been ascertained that some of the ductless glands have a physiological relation to the blood-vascular system, and they have consequently been called the blood-vascular glands. As two of these glands, viz,, the spleen and thymus, contain large quantities of lymphoid tissue, and are the seats of production of lymph corpuscles, they have been named blood-lymph-vascular GLANDS. It is possible that the thyroid gland, the pituitary and pineal glands, and the supra-renal capsules, may have a physiological relation to the vascular system, but as their structure differs in some particulars both from each other, and also from that of the spleen and thymus, their exact function is even yet involved in much obscurity. It may also be stated, that by some observers the coccy- geal and intercarotic bodies have been referred to the blood-vascular glands, but their structure more closely approaches that of a modified rete mirabile. I have pre- ferred, therefore, to group these glands together by the term Ductless Glands, which expresses an anatomical character common to the whole series, rather than to employ the term Blood-Vascular Glands, used by many writers,

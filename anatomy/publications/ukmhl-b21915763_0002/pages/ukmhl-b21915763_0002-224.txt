CHAPTEE IX. EESPIEATOEY SYSTEM. The Respiratory System is composed of organs, wHcli are engaged in the interchange of gases between the blood and the atmospheric air. Through their instrumentality, the blood acquires oxygen from the air, imparts to it carbonic acid and watery vapour, and becomes changed from impure venous into pure arterial blood. In man and the higher vertebrates the interchange of gases is effected through the medium of a long branching tube, called the Windpipe, and of two vascular spongy organs, the Lungs. But as the windpipe has no direct communication with the ex- terior of the body, and opens superiorly into the pharynx, the atmospheric air has to pass, through either the nose or mouth into the pharynx, before it can enter the windpipe. The nose is the proper jjassage for its transmission, and constitutes therefore a part of the respiratory apparatus. As the nose is also an organ of sense, its anatomy has been described under that head (p. 322). The process of respiration consists of two acts, with intermediate pausesâ€”breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in, or Inspiration, consists in drawing air into

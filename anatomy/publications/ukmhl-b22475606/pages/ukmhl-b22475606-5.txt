ART, SCIENCE, MECHANICS, AND ENGINEERING. numbers written in detail as before, are 3 ten-thous. 1 thous. 8 hund. 1 ten and 4 units 1 ten-thous. 9 thous. 7 hund. 8 tens and 6 units. Here we at once perceive that we cannot proceed as in the last example, for G units are more than 4 units, and 8 tens than I ten, and further on we find 9 thous. standing beneath 1 thous. Dut recollecting that we may add the same number to both of the given numbers, without altering their difference, (and the difference is that which we are in quest of,) we proceed to apply the principle in this manner: add ten to the 4 units of the upper line, making 14 units, and one to the 8 tens of the under lines, making 9 tens ; so that the numbers will now read 3 ten-thous. 1 thous. 8 hund. 1 ten and 1 4 units, 1 ten-thous. 9 thous. 7 hund. 9 tens and G units. Again, add 1 hund.= 10 tens to the 1 ten in the upper line, making 11 tens, and 1 hund. to the 7 hund. of the under line, making 8 hund. so that now the numbers will read 3 ten-thous. 1 thous. 8 hund. 11 tens and 14 units, 1 ten-thous. 9 thous. 8 hund. 9 tens and G units. Lastly, add 1 ten-thous. = 10 thous. to the 1 thous. of tho up- per line, making 11 thous. and 1 ten-thous. to the 1 ten-thous. of the under line, making 2 ten-thous., so that the number will read 3 ten-thous. 11 thous. 8 hund. 11 tens and 14 units, 2 ten-thous. 9 thous. 8 hund. 9 tens and 6 units. Now, these numbers are not the same as those given ; but we know that their difference must be the same since we have made', exactly the same additions to each ; and by subtracting the one from the other, as we did in the first example, we get as the dif- ference sought 1 ten-thous. 2 thous. 0 hund. 2 tens and 8 units, that is 12028. Therefore 31814 — 19786 = 12028, and the proof is, that 19786 + 12028 = 31814.* We may now imbody these processes in a rule, as follows : I. Write the number which is to be subtracted, (which is of course always the lesser of the two and is called the subtra- hend,) under the other, (which is called the minuend,) so that its units may fall under the units of the other, the tens under the tens, and so on. I Subtract each figure of the lower line from that above it, f that can be done. When that cannot f/e done, add 10 to the upper figure, and then subtract the lower figure, but when that is tone, recollect to add 1 to the next figurp in the lower line before subtracting it from its corresponding figure in the upper line. Example.—Find 867543267—1645*67345= ? Arrange the numbers as directed in I. of the rule. Here f—5 = 2 ; 6 — 4 = 2; 2 — 3 is mpossible, but 12 — 3 = 9, and ■arry 1; then 3 — (1 + 7) = 3 — 8 s again impossible, but 13—8=5 tndcarry 1; 4—(1 + 6) = 4 — 7 is Iso impossible, but 14 — 7=7 ■ud carry 1; 5 — (1 + 5) = 5 —is also impossible, but 15 — 6 = 9 47 iS,f0U',‘dcd1 °n the evident fact- that a number is not altered in value by placing ciphers on the left of it. Thus, 3wa is the same as 00321, for it means 3 hundreds, 2 tens, and 1 unit, and 00321 means in reality nothing more ; for 0 ten-thousands, 0 thousands, 3 hundred, 2 tens, and 1 unit merely differs in saying that the number contains no tens’of thousands, and no thousands. It would be very different, how- ever were the ciphers placed on the right; for then the 3 would become tens of thousands, the 2 would be thousands, and the 1 would mean a hundred, and the ciphers would denote that there were no tens or units. The following are instances in which these remarks are applicable : 8360006 1842007 6756 90009 30000680 9091 8353244 1751993 29991589 When two or more numbers are given to be subtracted from two or more other numbers, it is generally best to add together all those'belonging to the minuend, and then all those belonging to the subtrahend, and to take the sum of the one set from the sum ot the other ; thus,— Minuend =867543267 Subtrahend = 164567345 Remainder = 702975922 nd carry 1; 7—(1 + 4) = 2/; 6 — 6 = 0; and 8—1 = 7. rhe work is readily proved by adding together the remainder nd subtrahend, the sum of- course should be the minuend.

Answer, 4686. 1 What is 2572 — 183 + 17856—1273 + 534? Answer, 19506. There is an expeditious and elegant mode of subtracting num- bers by means of what is called the arithmetical complement. It is not takeft notice of in our elementary treatises on arithmetic because it requires the learner to know something about the principle before he can practise it with success, and this is rec- koned superfluous, in the art of ciphering. We shall try to make it plain. \ Let it be required .to find 1000 — 732. The answer by the common rule, is 268 ; but we shall obtain exactly the same result by subtracting the units from 10, and the other figures successively from 9.* ° Thus, 10 — 2 = 8 ; 9 — 3=6; and 9 — 7 — 2. We may therefore state it as a rule, that to subtract a number from 1,followed by as many ciphers as the number has figures, the figure in the unit’s place must be subtracted from 10, and the others from 9 : Thus, 1000000—708367 = 291633. This process, which is so easy that it scarcely deserves to be counted an operation, is made use of for our purpose in the following manner :— Let the difference 3487—259 be required. It is here evident that by decomposing 3487 into 2487 + 1000, the difference between it and 259 is not altered, and we shall have 2487 + 1000 — 259 ; but 1000 — 259 = 741 ; Therefore, 2487 + 1000—259 = 2487 + 741 =3228. Thus, instead of subtracting 259, we have, in fact, added 741 and all cases of subtraction may be reduced to cases of addition in the same way. The following subtractions may be made by this mode, and then we will show how the rule may be somewhat shortened. 1660 — 786 = 874 46S6 — 996 = 3690. All that is necessary to the shortening of the process, is the admission of this principle : the difference between two numbers is not altered by adding a number to it, if at the same time we subtract the same number from it. Let this number always be 1, followed by as many ciphers as the number to be subtracted has figures. Thus, suppose it is required to find the difference 9846 635. t This is the principle noticed in the note preceding 9 tens, and 10 units. for 1000 = 9 hundreds,

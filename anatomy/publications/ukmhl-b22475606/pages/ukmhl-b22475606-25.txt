In conformity with this view of the subject, - are fractions ; and the term fraction may even extend to whole numbers : and all equal to 17. for example, are fractions 4. According 'to our new notation, which we thus find includes all our former ideas of number, and others besides, the part above the line is called the numerator, and that beneath, the denominator, and both of these are called terms of the fraction. The numerator takes its name from its expressing the number of parts of a certain kind that are taken ; the denominator, from its giving name, as sevenths, ninths, to the parts into which the unit is divided. As long as the numerator is less than the denomi- nator, the fraction is less than 1 ; thus, j| is less than 1 zu for the denominator is the unit divided into 20 parts, and we must there- fore have 20 such parts to make 1; but the fraction ^ shows that 7hCUU33t!ty Considcred containa only 10 such parts. Similarly, lT 33’ are a11 less than l.and are sometimes, for that reason, termed proper fractions. On the other hand, when the nume- rator is equal to, or exceeds the denominator, the fraction is equal to, or greater than 1 ; thus £ is equivalent to 1, for it is tne fifth part of 1 repeated 5 times, or it is the magnitude of qach of the parts which result from dividing 5 into's equal parts T' f 3-I’ are all equal to 1 and consequently vuated by the explanation that every fraction may be regarded as a division to be performed. But if wanted it is this : Divide the numerator by the denominator. For example, how many units are there in - ? Since f = 1, it is plain that as often as 2? con- 6 ' 6 tains -so many units there will be. therefore, Now 23 = 6 + 6 + 6+ 5; f ■H\+l ff+S= 1 + 1 + 1 +1=3 + }- or 4 and this agrees with the rule ; for 23-6 give 3 for quotient and 5 for remainder ; and the sixth part of 5 is |; therefore Similarly 23-6 = 3 + 2-or 32- 1 = 39 = 5 = 7 + 2- £ = 83-5-11 = 7 +£ ““=150+14= log 3j5 = 30715 = 20r, 13 equal to each other. Again, | is greater than 1 : for the unit is here divided into 7 parts only, and the nume+tor consists of 12 or 7 + 5 such parts, that is of a whole unit afkd five-sevenths of a unit over, or using signs - = 1 §.. Expressions such as | f > in which ^e numerator is equal to or exceeds the\lenomina- tor, are usually called improper fractions; and when ahvexpres- sion consists of a whole number and a fraction, as 1£, it is com monly called a fractional or mixed number,' 5. There are two ways in which a fraction may be considered If we have, for instance, such a fraction as f, we may regard-it either as the third part of 2, or as twice the third part of 1 This is, indeed, plain from the foregoing discussion upon the division of 17 by 5; but in order to bring the principle more pro- minently before the mind, let the line a b be two yards ; I > and divide each of the yards a c and c b into three equal parts Ihen because a e = e p = f b, and divide the length a b into three parts, a e is the third part Of 2 : it is therefore £. But a e is twice a d, and a d is the third part of one yard a c ; and a third of a 1 »} Therefore a e=£ is twice £. Hence to get a length equal to two-thirds of a yard, it makes no difference whether we divide two yards into three equal parts and take one of them, or whether we divide one yard into three equal parts and take two of them. The symbol £ is made to stand for both these operations, since they both lead to the same result. By the same sort of reasoning we conclude that one-fifth of three and three-fifths of one, are identical and truly expressed by ? • and the double interpretation may be extended to all other cases’ 0. Ihe meaning may appear somewhat ambiguous when the numerator of the fraction is greater than the denominator For example, according to the latter interpretation, | would mean that 1 is divided into five equal parts, and that 8 of them are to be taken. The explanation is, however, very easy : the case requires simply that as many units be each divided into fifths as will give more than 8 such parts, and that 8 of them arc to be taken to form the numerator of the fraction. Thus, supposing the line a b to represent two yards, 8 8. The converse of this problem is the conversion of whole and mixed numbers into fractions, and is frequently needed. The rule is this : Multiply the integral part by the given deno- minator and the product increased by the numerator of the fractional part (if there be any such part) is the numerator of the new fraction. J As an example, express 3 in fifths. Since every 1 in 3 is t, therefore 3 = 5_d~ 5 — — 'J? 5 5 5 * Again, how many eighths in 7§ ? In 7 there are, reasoning as before, 7X8, or 56-eighths; therefore 7 and 3-eighths must contain 56 + 3, or 59-eighths; consequently 7— — Similarly 7 expressed in ninths is 5? 9 7~expressed in thirds is 3 3 9iJ expressed in twelfths .119 expressed in hundredths is 100 These two processes are the inverse of each other, and mutually prove each others’ results. 9. We come now to by far the most valuable property of a fraction. It is one, however, which we anticipated when we showed (Art. 14, page 142,) that the dividend and divisor may be either multiplied or divided by the same without affecting the quotient. As the greater part of the operations upon fractions have’ an immediate reference to the principle involved, we can- not he too particular in impressing it upon the mind of the student. It is the following :— The vhjue of a fraction is not altered by multiplying both its numerator and denominator by the same quantity. That is, | is the same as T\ or we shall obtain the result by dividing 1 yard into 12 parts, and taking 9 of them, and by dividing it into 4 parts and taking 3 of them. To prove this, let a e be a yard or any other definite length ; divide it into 4 equal parts, a b, b c, (hvided each into five equal parts; the whole number of parts is tinn f hCSe We {lre t0 take 8’ n^ely, ad, to form our frac- expressed by^ Part ** a flfth °f one >"a,'d- 8 ^ch fifths is truly to^i™ aSrnto"reckoned necessary in arithmetical works fraction Til the mtegers contained in an improper ■ ruction. The necessity of such a rule has, however, been ob- c d, and d e, and divide each of these parts into 3 equal parts ; then a d is But it is also +, for the whole line is divided’ into 12 equal parts, and ad contains 9 of them ; that is, we vet the same length by dividing a yard into 12 equal parts, and ta- king 9 of them, as we get by dividing it into 4 equal parts, and ta- king 3 of them. We have, therefore, no difficulty in concluding generally that f and T+ are the same thing. It follows from this that every fraction admits of innumerable alterations in its form, without suffering any change of value. Thus 12 3 4 2 4 6 8 2 * 9 8 10 12 14 16 , 49 — 56 — <tC- .5 — 6_ 7_S_ 10 — Vz ~ 14 — 16 ~ “C- ' 2S - L° r 35 : . 12 ' M On the same principle, it is shown that the terms of a fraction may both be divided by any number without any alteration of its value. This hardly needs demonstration : for | and T9 are the same, and f is made from +, by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3. 10. Though the two fractions f and -+ are the same in value, and either of them may be used for the other without error, yet

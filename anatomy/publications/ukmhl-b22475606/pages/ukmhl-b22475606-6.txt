48 THE IMPERIAL JOURNAL OF Ilcre, by adding 1000 and subtracting 1000, we get 9846 + 1000 — 635 — 1000 ; But, by performing the operation 1000 — 635, we get 9846 + 365 — 1000. Now, all that remains to be done is, to add 365 to 9846, and to subtract 1 from the thousands of the result; but we might put the 365 in place of the ciphers in 1000, provided we put some mark upon the 1 to show, that while the other figures are to. be added, that this one is to be subtracted. This is done by placing a dash, answering to the sign of subtraction, over the 1, making it 1, and making 365 — 1000intol365. This artifice will convert the above expression into 9S46 9846 + f365 = 9211 ; 1365 a calculation which is otherwise shown in the margin. The quantity 1365, is what is called the arithmetical 9211 complement of 635 ; and generally to find the arith- metical complement of any number, we must subtract the units figure from 10, the others from 9, and place 1 on the left of the result. It will also be observed, that this complement, added to the number, gives 0 for the sum. Tims 635 + 1365 = 0000 = 0. Farther, every case, where it is required to subtract a number wc may add its arithmetical complement. As we can readily perform such subtractions as 1000 — 635 mentally, in fact, as quickly as we can write the figures, the arithmetical complement furnishes us with a very neat and expe- ditious way of taking the balance of a successive set of additions and subtractions. For instance,— 32731+5729— 371 — 4834, 32731 takes the form shown in the margin ; the complement 5 <29 of 371 being 1629, and that of 4834 being 15166 ; _1629 the l’s in the columns must of course be subtracted 15166 as before shown. _ Presuming that the preceding principles are well 33loo understood, we may now show how sufficient exercise upon them maybe obtained, without putting ourselves to the needless trouble of writing such columns of “ questions tor exercise,” as we usually find in books. Let the indus nous student take a series of numbers, each containing one figure more than the preceding one ; say 271, 3567, 46891, 506<98, ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 111V71 trill 11 I'll'-' ^ivvvv****Q » •!

We might indeed state it as an axiom, that those students who find the greatest number of difficulties in learning mathe- matics, make the best mathematicians; and conversely, those who find the study exceedingly easy, rarely arrive at any degree of proficiency. The reason is obvious; the one class arc thinkers, and the other believers; the former must see that all is fairly demonstrated, the latter care not for the demonstration of any- thing. The skin is composed of four coats, the external, two middie, and the internal. 1st. The external coat is a thin cuticle, or scarf skin, endued with little sensibility, intended for a covering to the body, to protect it from outwmrd irritation, and shield it from immediate contact with the material substances and ele- ments that surround it. It is full of pores, covered with scales, perforated by the extremities of the perspiring and absorbing vessels, the ducts of the glands of the internal skin, and by the hairs. The nails and cuticle are connected, and in diseases of the skin, if the cuticle exfoliates, the nails are also pushed off; and after death, they both separate from the true skin underneath them, by maceration and putrefaction. The cuticle and nails are equally destitute of nerves and sensation. The nails are com- posed chiefly of a membranous substance, which possesses the properties of coagulated albumen, and contains a little phosphate of lime. Horns and nails have nearly the same component parts. The cuticle projects over the roots of the nails. The nails do not become scaly ar.d exfoliate like the cuticle, they grow from a root like the hair, though they are evidently a con- tinuation of the cuticle. The hairs grow from bulbous roots, situated in the cellular membrane, beneath the cuticle. The bulb is vascular, and connected by vessels with the cellular tissue. It consists of a double membrane, and the cellular texture lying betwixt them is filled with a bloody fluid. I he hair arises from the bottom of the internal sac, and when a hair is extracted, if the sac or bulb be left entire, it will be re- generated. The European has the longest hair; the Asiatic next; thirdly, the American; and lastly, the African; men of a dark sallow complexion are generally hairy on the breast and shoulders. There is very little difference in the growth of hair and wool; wool grows thickest in summer, and finest in spring and autumn; the fleece becomes coarse and hairy in a warm climate. A hair appears to be a kind of tube enveloped in a cuticle, its surface is covered with scales; hence its disposition to entangle with other hairs. A hair which is soft and flexible, and loses its curl in moist weather, parts easier with its gelatine than a strong elastic hair, which retains its curl, and parts with its oelatine in small quantities, with difficulty. Black haiis aie composed of an animal matter, which constitutes the greatest proportion,—a white solid oil, small in quantity; a grayish green oil, more abundant; iron, the state unknown; oxyde of man- ganese, phosphate of lime, carbonate of lime, very scanty; silica, and sulphur. . . ... The human cuticle is white, and does not vary its hue in dit- ferent individuals. It is as colourless in the African, as in the European; in the American Indian, as in the Asiatic. This fact may be easily proved, by a very simple experiment. If we apply a cantharides blister to a white man’s skin, it raises the cuticle, by causing a fluid called the serum, to form underneath it; now the skin, raised by the blister, is the external white coat, which I am describing. If you apply a blister to a negro's skin, the cuticle (or external coat,) which rises up and covers the serum, is also white, as white as the cuticle of a Scotchman. This experiment proves, that it is not the external cuticle which makes the negro black; for his outward skin, or cuticle, is as white as the European’s. The varied coloured skins of different individuals arise from other natural causes, which I will briefly explain, when describing the second coat. The cuticle is chiefly composed of a modification of coagulated albumen : coagulated albumen is that tasteless substance, which constitutes the out- ward portion of a boiled egg. In the negro, the internal surface of the cuticle is darker and softer than the external. The second, or mucous coat, lies in immediate contact with the upper, and is composed of numerous blood-vessels and nerves, which give it exquisite sensibility. You cannot touch any part of your body where the cuticle is thin, without feeling a sensation of contact with the second coat. It w white°in the European, and also in the infant negro, for about

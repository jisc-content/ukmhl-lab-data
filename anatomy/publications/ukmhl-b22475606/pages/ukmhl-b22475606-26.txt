The method of doi.m this was explained in our last chapter ; where it was like- wise’shown that when two numbers are divided by them gr^test common measure, the quotients are prime to each other When the terms of a fraction are reduced to this condition ; that is, in canable of being both measured by any number greater tha , SSto-l t. b, reduced,» i ..!»«.< »d cannot be expressed more simply or by any fraction having a smaller numerator and denominator. From all this it appears that a fraction is reduced to its lowest terms when its numerator and denominator are divided by their greatest common measure, or have all their common factors expunged. It frequently happens that the greatest common measure evident on inspection, as in the following instances where the com- mon factors are accented :— ft 2X4' 2 9 1X9' _ 1 ?_8 __ \x T, -- * — — ./ — n qi — q v o 9 35 5x7 5 12 3 X 4 3 81 9xy y 19 1 X 12" 1 1* 2x7’ _2 24 _8xJ^ 8 5 = OT = 4 21 = 3x7 -3 21 -7 X 3T 7 When the terms of the fraction are large numbers, it then be- comes necessary to apply the rule for finding the greatest com- mon measure of two numbers in order to eliminate the common factor of the terms. The following are instances : 22 X 404' 22 : 999 X 404' — 99 113 X 122* _ 113 1 — nn . - mn. — oo M.-ficun 764 X 122 764 have already shown that this division does not affect their value.

Our first object is to find equivalent fractions having a common denominator; but as a matter of course, it is of great importance that the denominator be as small as possible, and this is always the case when the numerators and this denominator have no common measure. A vain, the common denominator which fulfils these conditions, is=the least common multiple of all the denominators given, and is found as explained in our last Chapter, (Art. 10.) The method of proceeding will be best understood by an example. Let the given fractions be 1 2 3 7 9 17 £. 2 3 4 6 10 12 18 21 Find the least common multiple of these denominators: it is 12G0, and the equivalent fractions to be found, cannot obviously have a less common denominator than this, and it needs not be vreater. Taking it therefore as the denominator wanted, we find a set of multipliers for the numerators of the given fractions, simply by dividing the multiplier by all the denominators in succession. Thus 1260 v2 = 630 1260 = 4= 315 1260 = 10 = 126 1260 = 3 = 420 1260 = 6 = 210 1260 = 1-' — 10o 1260 = 18 = 70 1260 =21 = 60 We now multiply every given numerator by the result of its denominator in the preceding list, for the numerator of the equivalent fraction, and write 1260 for the common denominator of all, as follows :— , 1 . 630 1 X 630 = 630; therefore - is ^ 4 x 7 X 5 _ 1' x 7 X 1 8X6 xTo _ 2' X 6 X 2' 2x6x2 12 X 19 X 33 _ 2* X 3* X 3’ _ 1' X 1' X 3_ 3 18 X 24 X 11 — S' X 4' X 1' 1' X 2 X 1 2 21 X 16 X 4 _ 3 14 X 32 X 8 8 7 X 25 X 30 _ 3 28 X 35 X 100 56 11. Since the relative magnitudes of fractions depend upon two numbers, it is not always easy, at first view, to pronounce which of two quantities so expressed is the greater, cspocmlly if ,b, hicrh numbers. For instance, take 4 and Tr. ne- , 2 . 810 2 X 420 = 840; therefore - is — 3 X 315 = 945; therefore 3 . 945 ‘ 12(10 7 X 210 : , , 7 . 1470 = 1470; therefore - is r,c() 9 X 126 : , 9 . 1134 = 1134; therefore ^ is - 1260 , , 5 . 525 5 X 105 = 525; therefore - is -5=5 , , 17. 1190 17 X 70 = 1190; therefore ->s ^ 8 X 60 = 480; 8 . 4S0 therefore - is i2«j the terms are high numbers. For instance, take r and rv. Be fore we can compare their values, or express their sum or differ- ence by a single number, we must effect such a change on one or both of them, that their component units shall be the same. Let the terms of % be multiplied by 15, and the terms of by 5, then | becomes 4*, and *§ becomes and as these new fractions have the same values as those given (art. 9.) and express parts of the same unit, for the denominator in both is the same, we are able to pronounce on their relative magnitudes, and as we shall afterwards see, are able to find their sum or difference with comparative facility. To show how this i3 done, we shall take an example. Ret the proposed fractions he £. f, ft, *. Multiply both terms of 1 bv 4X6X3; both terms of J by 2X0X3; both terms of I by 2 X 4 X 3 ; both terms of | by 2 X 4 X 6 ; then it appears that The following instances may be managed exactly in the same way, and will afford sufficient exercise in the rule, should they be worked over with care.

This is the rule commonly given ; and it is at once obvious, tliat it must always succeed in forming a new set of fractions, having a common denominator. Baton examining the resulting fractions of the foregoing example, we find that all the nu - rators and the common denominator are divisible by 1 -, and ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. CHAPTER VII.

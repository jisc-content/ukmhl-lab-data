68 THE IMPERIAL JOURNAL OF without any change in the problem. Again our odd term is 5 days, and the answer sought is x days ; and since a greater number of days must obviously be allowed to 19 men than to 57 men, to accomplish the same amount of work, it follows that x is greater than 5 ; and consequently, of the two numbers, 19 and 57, the former is the first term of the proportion. The state- ment is, therefore, as follows:— men. men. days. days. k v/ K'r 19 : 57 :: 5 : x = - ^ - = 15 Six yards of cloth,^ wide, were required for a certain purpose; how many yards are necessary, the width being -y ? Although in this question thff four terfps are all yards, we see that in one case they represent length, and in the other breadth ; and that 6 yards and the unknown quantity are of the same kind—namely, length. The second pair of terms of the proportion is, therefore, 6 yds. : x yds. Also, the broader the cloth, the less must be the length necessary ; and f being greater than f, we must find x greater than 6. Consequently, f must be the first term, and f the second of the proportion ; thus, f : £ :: 6 : x. But as the first ratio will not be changed by multiplying its terms by the same number, we may get rid of the fractional form in which these terms are expressed, by multiplying them by a multiple of their denominators ; that is, by 3 X 4, Or 12. This multipli- cation being performed, the proportion becomes 8:9 :: 6 : x, when x = ~ 6£ 8 That is, 6£ yards of cloth, of § yd. wide, are equivalent to G yards of £ yd. wide. It often happens, especially in commercial questions, that the terms given consist of various denominations. This has the effect of rendering the calculation more lengthy; but it in no way affects the principle. Thus, suppose we have this question :— What is the price of 18 yds. 2 qrs. 2 nails of cloth, at the rate of 3 yds. 2 qrs. for £1 16s. ? Here the term sought is money, the corresponding term being £1 16s. ; and since 18 yds. 2 qrs. 2 nails will cost more than 3 yds. 2 qrs., we make the least of these quantities the first term.' The statement is, therefore, this :— 3 yds. 2 qrs. : 18 yds. 2 qrs. 2 nls. : : £1 16s. : £x. But as we cannot multiply and divide by the first terms in their compound state, and as they admit of multiplication without affecting the question, we reduce them both to the same deno- mination ; namely, nails. We also reduce the third term to the lowest name contained in it; namely, shillings. The statement, thus modified, is as follows :— 56 nails : 298 nails : : 36 shillings : x shillings. We might now proceed to multiply 36 shillings by 298, and to divide the product by 56 ; by which we would find the value of x = 191££ shillings. But, observing that the first and second terms are both divisible by 2, we perform that operation, which does not affect the ratio ; and the statement is reduced to the following :—■ 28 nails : 149 nails : : 36 shillings : x shillings. We might solve the question also with these numbers, from which we would find x = 191-lf- shillings as before; but, since the first term is a divisor, and the third a multiplier, it will evidently not affect the value of x; that is, the answer sought, to divide these terms by 4, and, this done, the propor- tions is as follows, 7 nails : 149 nails : : 9 shillings : x shillings, and this is not suceptible of further reduction without introduc- ing fractions. To find x then, we have 9 shillings X 149 , x shillings = 1 =1914 shillings = £9 11s. 6|d. f The compound quantities in this question might have been con- verted into fractions, and the operations performed by the rules for multiplying and dividing fractions, thus, yards. yards. 3i = i : 18£ = J-iA : : £14 _.£j. : , „9X 149 X 2 2683 whence a: = £ 7x8x. _ £ 2g() _ £9 11s. 6fd.£ Or the quantities might have been converted into decimals, and the operations performed by the rules for decimals, thus, 3'5 yds. : 18 625 yds. : : £l-8 : £x, and, dividing the first two terms by 5, this becomes ‘7 yds. ; 3'725 yds, : : £1‘8 : £x whence x = £ 18 X_ £&'™5 =£9 11s. 6|d. ‘42857 ... From the preceding operations it then appears that the first and second terms must be of the same kind and denomination, and that the third term may be reduced to any denomination which may be the most convenient; observing that the answer will be a quantity of the same name. The first and second terms, and also the first and third terms may be multiplied or divided by any number without affecting the answer—which allows of the terms being reduced, and the operation abridged or made more convenient. No precise rule, however, can be given for the performance of these modifications ; and it depends entirely upon the ingenuity of the student, to detect when they are applicable, and to what extent. Sometimes the proportion appears deficient in the number of its terms, as in the following question :— A ship’s crew have provisions left for 10 days’ rations, but wish to remain at sea for 15 days ; to what must each ration be reduced ? Here we do not find four terms ; but it is evident that one of them is understood, and that the problem is equiva- lent to the following The ration 1 would be given to each man were they to remain at sea 10 days ; but, as they are to be at sea 15 days, what fraction of the ration 1 should be allowed him ? The statement is obviously 15 : 10 : : 1 : x = •£. Similarly—If a reservoir be filled by one pipe in 6 hours, by another in 5} hours, and by a third in 4| hours ; in what time will it be filled by the three pipes all running together ? The first consideration here is the portion of the reservoir which is filled by the first pipe in 1 hour, that is this question : If the whole be filled in 6 hours, what part will be filled in 1 hour ? In answer, we have 6 hrs. : 1 hr. : : 1 : x = £. And similarly for the other two, we have 5£ hr. : 1 hr. : : 1 : x = -jr; 4f hr. : 1 hr.: : 1 : x = X3T. Thus, the three pipes running together will in 1 hour fill this frac- tion-nf the reservoir, viz., £ -)- -j- XST, that is, -j- + iV — 4; ahd the question now becomes : If 4 of the reservoir be filled in 1 hour, in what time will the whole be filled ? It will evi- dently require more than 1 hour : the proportion is therefore as follows, 4 (of cap. of reservoir) : 1 (whole cap. of reservoir):: 1 hr.: x hr. whence x = 1 hr. -4- 4 = 1 hr. X £ = £ hr. = If hr.; that is, the three pipes will, when all running together, fill the reservoir in If hour. Questions of this,, kind may, however, be resolved indepen- dently of the rule of three : thus unity (1) being divided by the times in which the reservoir would be filled by each of the pipes separately, gives the fractions of it which they would severally fill in the given unit of time ; and that unit, being divided by the sum of the fractions of^Ihe whole capacity thus filled, gives the whole time. For instance'.'sin the question above, the times are 6 hours, 5£ hours, and 4£ hours, and 1 divided by each of these quantities gives the fractions £, XT, X3T, the sum of which, as found above, is 4 ; and 1 hour, divided by 4, gives If hour as before. \ It frequently happens that questions contain more than three given quantities. When these consist, of two periods in which the terms are respectively of the saniq kind, and vary propor- tionally, the question constitutes what iq termed a compound, proportion, and its solution belongs to "the Double Rule of Three. The following is an example;— \ If 20 men can build 160 yards of wall in 15 days, how many yards ought 30 men to build in 12 days ? Ilehe the 20 men and 15 days may be regarded as associated agencies in producing the effect expressed by 160 yards, and 30 men and 12 days in producing the effect x yards to be found ; but the efficiency of 20 men working 15 days may be expressed by 20 X 15 or 300 and the efficiency of 30 men working 12 days by 30 X 12 or 360. Now as 160 yards is the effect produced by 300, it is obvious that x must be greater than ICO yards, since the agency to effect

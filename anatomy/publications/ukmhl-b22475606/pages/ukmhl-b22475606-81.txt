It l)as been already observed that the needle is Vrged in opposite direction's in different parts of the circle ; ^hat, in the northern or remote portion, its tendency is onward from west to north, and north to east; but in the adjacent or southern portion, the tendency is from west to south, if • Kilt lniiemimk nn i- ^ I , L Fig!7. . , — - “,vj ^ auuLu, me uumuiueu acuuii oi an electric current upon ooin and south to east ; but inasmuch as at the neutral point oft poles of a magnetic needle, balanced in the usual way upon the eft, the/tangential force is in a direct line with the its centre, and we shall first take the case of a current mov- needle itself which is therefore at right angles to the line jug downward in a vertical wire external to the circle in connecting its pole with the conducting wire, this force, so ft’hich a horizontal magnet moves.

When the conducting wire is placed very near the circle round which the pole of the needle moves, the dispro- portion between the unequal portions of the circle is con- siderably augmented, and becomes still greater, the nearer the wire is approached to the circle ; thus, in figure 7, the arc n, o, p, is extremely small compared with the larger arc N> p ; but if the needle be placed at the least possible distance from the line connecting the centre of motion with the conducting wire, and upon the left side, in place of passing over the diminished arc to attain the point, r, of stable equilibrium, it will in- stantly recede from that point and move in the op- posite direction, as if repelled, until by the circuitous route it reaches the point of per- manent neutrality. 30. If we suppose the con- ducting wire to pass through the circumference itself, in such case, the arc which in the former case separated the two neutral points is reduced to nothing, and therefore if the needle be placed on the left of the wire, but nearly in contact with it, as- in figure 8 ; it will move all round the circle, un- til it reaches the other side of the wire ; but then, its position will be unstable ; for, the impetus it has already received will suffice to carry it past this point, and then it, of course, receives a fresh im- pulse, so that it may be as- sumed to be capable of main- taining a state of continued revolution. If the conducting wire be placed within the circle, the neutral points have, in such case, no existence, and under such circumstances, the needle would perpetually revolve in the same direction, if the substance conducting the current were of such a nature as to admit of the passage of the needle across it. 31. It may be here observed, that when the arcs of oscil- lation of the needle are small, the influences which tend to bring the needle to its point of rest bear a very near pro- portion to the arcs themselves ; so that the motions of the needle in this respect depend upon the same law as those of the pendulum ; for which reason they are available in esti- mating the comparative intensities of the electro-magnetic influences when acting on the needle at different distances, and with greater or less quantity of current; for the force will be found to be strictly proportional to the square of the number of oscillations performed by the needle in a given time. 32.

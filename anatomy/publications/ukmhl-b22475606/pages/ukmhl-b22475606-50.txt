368 THE IMPERIAL JOURNAL OF to left of the vertical line, we might proceed with the multiplica- tion, commencing always with that figure of the multiplicand which is immediately over the figure of the multiplier, taking no account of those to the right. But we may observe, from the ex- ample, that it is necessary to consider, both what is carried directly iu the formation of the different lines and what is car- ried from the addition of the first column on the right. Now, the first of these may be allowed for, by carrying the tens which result from the multiplication of the figure immediately on the right of that above the figure of the multiplier ; and both cor- rections may be allowed for at once, by taking the nearest num- ber of tens in that product; that is, by carrying 1 from 5 up to 15 ; 2 from 15 up to 25 ; 3 from 25 up to 35—and so on. Thus, for 24, we carry 2, but for 26, we carry 3—because 24 is more nearly 2 tens than 3 tens, and 2G is more nearly 3 tens than 2 tens. We shall now write the example in this abridged form, with the explanation of the several steps upon the right. 5'247 ( Multiplier reversed; units’ figure falling under second 5633 \decimal place of multiplicand. ('Product by 3; figure to begin with 4; but 3 times 1574 - < 7 = 21 ; nearest tens 2, which carry to 4X3 making (j4; put down 4 and carry 1 ;the rest as usual. Product from second 3 of multiplier; figure to begin with 2; figure to carry 1 from 4X3^ rest as usual. Product from 6; figure to begin with 5; figure to carry 1 from 2X6; rest as usual. . (Product from 5 ; figure to begin with 0; carriage ° " \figure 3 from 5X5. This is equally near 2 tens and 3 tens; but we at once see that, by going back an- 17 65 other step, we would have obtained a carriage of 1 making 26. It will here be observed, that our rule has failed to give us the nearest possible value of 5 247 X 3'365 to two places of de- cimals, a nearer approximation being 17 66. The error is, how- ever, very small, and if greater accuracy be required than the rule ensures, it may be obtained by finding a decimal place more than is wanted, and striking it off after the addition is made. The rule, then, may be stated as follows :— To multiply two decimals together retaining only n decimal places—. I. Reverse the multiplier, striking out the decimal point, and place it under the multiplicand in such a way that what was its units’ figure shall fall under the ?ith decimal place of the multi- plicand, placing ciphers, if necessary, on the right of the multi- plicand, so that every figure of the multiplier shall have a figure or cipher above it. II. Multiply, as usual, with this difference, that each figure of the multiplier must begin with the figure of the multiplicand which comes immediately over it, taking care to add to the pro- duct the nearest number of tons which would be obtained by the multiplication of the figure immediately on the right of that taken. III. Place the first figures of all the lines under one another; add as usual, and mark off n places from the right for decimals. The following examples will fully illustrate this rule. The first two lines are the multiplicand and multiplier, and the number of decimal places to be retained will be seen from the results. 36-3771 •0699268 3-4641016 9-99339 •9975641 17-32508 363771 •0699268 346410160 933999 14657990 8052371 327394 029341 346410160 32739 62934 242487112 3273 4S94 10392305 109 350 692820 11 42 173205 3 3 2771 363-529 •0697564 60-0158373 Division admits of a simplification analogous to that explained for multiplication. Thus, supposing 320-31768 is to be divided by 93-4525, and only six places of decimals be required—we proceed as follows:— Having found the two first 934525) 3203176'S (3'427599 figures 3'4 in the usual manner, we suppress the right hand figure 5 of the divisor instead of annexing a cipher to the re- mainder, as in the common 2803575 3996018 3738100 process. To find the next partial quotient 2, we have therefore for dividend 257918 93452 5)257918 186905 and divisor 93452, with any carriage which may arise from the suppressed figure 5. The 9345 25)71013 65416 operation gives us, for the next remainder, 71013, which is to be divided by 9345 for the next 934 525)5597 4673 partial quotient 7. This gives us a remainder, 5597, to be divided by 934 for another 93 4525)924 841 quotient figure 5. And so on. As in multiplication it is ne- cessary, each time, that a figure is neglected from the divisor to add to the following 9 34525)83 81 934525)2 product the tens which that figure would have given. The pro- cess may now be put into the form of a rule thus— To divide one decimal by another retaining only n places of decimals in the quotient. Proceed one step in the ordinary division and determine what part of the quotient the figure is which is thereby found. Pro- ceed in the ordinary way until the number of figures remaining to be found be at least one less than the number of figures in the divisor ; then, instead of annexing ciphers ih the ordinary way, abridge the divisor one figure at each step, taking care in multi- plying the abridged divisor to carry the nearest ten from the figure which is struck off. Repeat this operation, striking off at every successive step one figure from the divisor until no figures are left; then, since it is known, from the first, in what place the first figure of the quotient is, and also how many decimal places are required, we can tell from the beginning, how many figures there will be in the whole quotient. Should the divisor contain more figures than are wanted in the quotient they may be struck off before commencing the division ; and if there be ciphers on the left of the divisor they may be omitted, taking care to move the decimal point of the quotient as many places to the right as there were ciphers struck out. The following examples will fully illustrate the rule. The quotients are written beneath each, to save room, and the number of decimal places required is marked over each example.

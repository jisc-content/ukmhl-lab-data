352 THE IMPERIAL JOURNAL OF which is possible, and gives x = 3 j j miles. From this we con- clude that the poiut of meeting is M2 and not M, ; and the cor- rectness of the solution is easily proved by verification. In this instance, then, the impossible subtraction occurred in conse- quence of x being taken in a direction exactly opposite to the true one. 61. Comparing the equatio formed from these problems, find From Problem I. Incorrect, 40 1853. a: = 3 (12—a:), Correct, 40 -j— a; = 3 (12 -j- ®), or at ^ ——— — years after 1853. From Proclem II. Incorrect, 55—x 45-f-a; Correct, years l(fore miles west of P. miles east of P. From these instances, the following princiftje will be under- stood :— 1°. When the value of x deduced from an eqvtetion, contains an impossible subtraction, the meaning of x has b&en misunder- stood in forming that equation, and requires to be mtered. 2°. The equation will be corrected by changing Uhe sign of every term which contains x only once as a factor. 4The rule is not extended to such terms as xx, xxx.\ 3°. The result will be corrected by inverting the ternrB of the impossible subtraction, (that is, by changing 36 — 4() into —36) and giving to a: a meaning directly opposite tq that which was supposed when the incorrect equation was obtained. Example.— The state of A and B’s affairs is such, that if they gain £200 and £100 respectively, A will be half as rich as ; but if they gain £700 and £200 respectively, A will he twice m rich as B. What is the actual state of their affairs ? Three cases present themselves :—1. Both parties may possess property. 2. Both may be in debt. 3. One may have property, and the other only debt. there is c x -}- d greater than a x b, and not equal to it. Let the sign of those terms containing x be changed; the proposed equa- tion then becomes b — a x = d — c x which gives d—b and this is possible. This anomaly then resolves itself into the preceding, and the equation and result are rectified in the same way. Problem in illustration.—A and B, in the course of a journey between the towns of C and D, travel in the same direction; A at the rate of 9 miles an hour, and B at the rate of 7. They are, at the same moment of time, at A and, B, distant 20 miles from each other. At what point between C and D are they together ? | | p j , —j ID M, A B Mo The problem does not state, whether they travel towards C or D. Suppose then that they travel towards C, and are together at M., and let AM, =x. Then A moves through AM, = x - hours. / And B moves through BM, = 20 x in 20 -j~ x hours. or These times are equal 20 —a: whence x = 180 £x. Try the first of these suppositions, and let A’s property be Then £(x -j- 200) = A’s property when he has gaihed £200. When B has gained £100, he is twice as rich as A is after gaining £200. £2 (x -J- 200) = B’s property when he has gained £100. And £2 (x -f- 200) — £100 = £(2# -f- 300) ■=£ B’s original pro- perty. Again : £(at-f—700) = A’s property when he has gained £700. £(2 .c-f—300) -j- £200 = B’s property when he has gained £200. By the question, A is now twice as rich as B; consequently, x + 700 — (3 x -j- 300) -{- 200, whdnce 700—1000 which is impossible. Try the second case, and modify the equa- tion by 2°, and let £x be A’s debt. This gives 700 • — (300 — 2x) 200, whence 1000 — 700 and . . x— £100. This explains A’s circumstances. To find out B’s, we know that when 4 has gained £200, his property is 'C'oftA and therefore, by the question, the property of B is £(200 £2(200 x) when he has gained £100 ; consequently, £100 — £2(200—x) =£(2fe—300)is B’s debt = £200 — £300 £ 100-{— €2,200—r) = £(300—2ar)is B’sproperty=£300—£200 or £100. The answer to the question therefore is: A is in debt £100, and B has £100. 62. Anomaly 2.—The solution of a x -f b = c x -f d d — b ——. If it should now happen that d is greater than b, and c greater than a, there is then an impossible subtraction in the denominator of the result, and it is otherwise obvious that the equation is absurd ; for c and d being greater than a and b, which is impossible, let AM , = x. 9 7 7 —9 Suppose now that they travel towards D, and Then A moves through AM3 = x in - hours. And B moves through BM, = x— 20 in x — 20 hours. The times are equal whence x — 180 9 — 7 which is possible, and gives x = 90 miles. Tire answer then is: If theydravel towards C, they were together at M2 ; and if they' travel towards D, they will be together at M2; and M2 is 90 miles from As present situation, and 90 — 20 or 70 from B’s. [It is ‘.at once obvious that is a correction of but Exercise.—A’s agi as old as B ? Ans. years ayo. 63. Anomaly 3.—If is 30, and B’s 9. When will A be four times ever: but A was four times as old as B two ax — c x = d solving a x -j- d — c x -j- d, thus: d—b we afterwards find that a is less than c, and d less than b, it shows that in subtracting c x -f- b from each side of the equation, we have subtracted too much, since by this supposition both sides are less than c x -j- b. Subtract then tti-f d, and we get b — d—cx — ax, whence b — d -d' and the subtractions are both possible. This then resolves itself into the error of process noticed in Art. 71, and does not arise from a misconception of the problem.

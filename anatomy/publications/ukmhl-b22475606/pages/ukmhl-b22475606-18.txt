THE IMPERIAL JOURNAL OF 114 That one figure of the given dividend appears on the right of every partial dividend. 2d. That for every figure of the dividend not employed in the first partial division, there is a quotient figui e ° 9^ From the nature of the numeration scale, it is obvious that no partial quotient can exceed 9, which is the highestnumber of only one figure : should a partial product come out 10 or more, there is an error in the preceding step. 10. From the foregoing principles, the following rule for division is deduced :— , I. Write the divisor and dividend in one line, and place e- versed parentheses on each side of the dividend. , II Cut off from the left of the dividend, the smallest numbei of figures which make a number as great or greater ^anfihe divisor- find what number of times the divisor is contained in these, and write the figure which results as the first figure of the ^lll^MuUiply the divisor by the quotient figure, and subtract the product from the number which was cut off' as a partial dividend, from the left of the given dividend (If tto^duet cannot be subtracted, that is, if it is greater than the part of the dividend cut off, the figure placed in the quotient a less (inure must be taken. On the other hand, if after the sub traction, the remainder be greater than the divisor, the quotient figure has been taken too small, and a greater one must be taUnf on ^ qj tU remainder place the figure of the dividend which comes next after those at first how often this number contains the divisor and ^ inq figure on the right of the first figure of tlw quotient, the divisor by it, and subtract the £ partial dividend. (Should it happen at any mainder, increased by the figure of the dividend taken down is less than the divisor, a 0 must be placed m the quotient, and'.an- other fiqure of the dividend brought down; and this must be re- peated fff necessary, until the augmented remainder is capable lof containing the divisor, or the figures of the dividend are ex- ^TVroceed with all subsequent partial dividends as directed in IV., continuing the process till all the figures of the div are brought down. The following example illustrates this rule 485)423105(873 3880 3540 3395 1455 1455 0 so great as it in general appears to the beginner. We take the following example to show how it is accomplished—Divide 423405 by 485. Taking the four figures on the left of the dividend to form a number capable of containing the divisor, we do not see immediately how often 4234 may contain 485. To aid us in guessing, we observe that 485 is betwTeen 400 and 500, and that if it were either the one or the other of these numbers, the question would be reduced to finding how often 4 or 5 is contained in 42. The reason is, that 4 or 5 being con- tained in 42 as often as 400 or 500 is in 4200, and this last differs little from 4234. We see at once, then, that our . quotient figure cannot be greater than 10, nor less than 8: it cannot be so great as 10; for on that supposition, the three figures on the left of the dividend would contain the divisor once, which they do not. It only remains, then, to try whether 9 or 8, employed as a multiplier of 485, yields a product which can be subtracted from 4234, and we find that it; u 8; 8^,there- fore, is the first figure of the quotient. When 485X8 — 3880 subtracted, and the next figure (0) of the dividend annexed, we find the second partial dividend to be 3540. Reasoning upon our divisor as before, we observe that the noxt quotient figure can- not he greater than 8, nor less than 7 ; but as 485 is nearer to oOO than to 400, we try 7, which results from a division of 351 by 7, the supposition turns out to be correct; for 48oX / -3395, and this subtracted from 3540, leaves 145, which is less than the divisor. By annexing 5 to 145, we get 1455, our third partial dividend, and as 1455 approaches to illl’ we try 3 for our next quotient figure, and find that 485 X3— 14jj. It would now be highly advantageous to repeat the foregoing three articles, with the following examples :— Divisor. Dividend. Quotient. 251 )577556(2301 502 755 753 256 251 Remainder 5 Proof. 2301 Quotient. 251 Divisor. 2301 11505 4602 5 Remainder. 577556 Dividend. 3978 6331 197028 = 234 ~ 301 - If 21 Prove that 224091 = 4309 X 52 + 23. Aiso, that ?^J=23 = 4309 x 26. Is 215414 = 1781X121+13? Here we take the first three figures on the left of the dividend, as the first partial dividend, and dividing by the divisor, we write in the quotient the number 2, resulting from the division, and multiply the divisor by this number. We write the product 502 under the partial dividend 577. The subtraction be- ing performed, we bring down the 5 hundreds of the dividend, and an- nex the figure to 75, the remainder. We divide this new partial dividend by the divisor, and obtain 3 as the second figure of the quotient; we multiply the divisor by this number, and subtract the product 753. To the remainder, 2, we annex 5, the tens’ figure of the dividend, making a partial dividend 25. But as this does not contain the divisor, (or, as we say for the sake of uniformity of exnression. as 2o contains 251, 0 ... times,) we write 0 for the next figure of the quotient, and bring down 6, the units’ figure of the dividend, making the partial di - dend 256. This containing the divisor once, we therefore write 1 l the units’ place of the quotient, and subtract the divisor, that is, 251X1 = 251, from the partial dividend 256; this gives a re- mainder 5. Therefore 577556 = 251X 2301 -f-5. When the divisor contains several figures, as in the foregoing example, some difficulty may be felt in discovering how often t is contained in the partial dividend. Although nothing but practice can enable us to do this with facility—for with every one it is a sort of guess-work—yet the difficulty is not in reality ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. CHAPTER IV.

CHAPTER XII. THE JOISTS. The bones composing the skeleton are articulated, or joined, to one another, in three different ways. 1st, They are found dove- tailed into one another, with the intervention of a very thin layer of cartilage, and are quite immovable. 2d, They are connected by means of one or more layers of cartilage between them, and ligaments or fibrous bands on their outsides, tying them together, and admitting of more or less motion. 3d, They are united by means of cartilages, ligaments, and synovial membranes, which united apparatus form the most perfect joints, such as are found between the bones of the extremities. The unions of the bones of the cranium are called sutures, from the Latin word signifying to sew, because they seem as if stitched together; the fibres of the one bone forming prolonga- tions which pass into the notches or spaces left by the similar prolongations of the other, as is seen in the figure of the skull already given at p. 296, ante. Between these runs a thin layer of cartilage. These sutures run in determinate lines over the head, as seen in the drawing of the cranium just referred to ; but, in an article of this kind, for popular reading, it would be out of place to give a more detailed description of them. The bones of the spine are united by thick layers of a peculiar cartilage, mixed with ligaments, placed between them, admitting of but little motion between any pair of bones, but allowing con- siderable ^ curvatures to take place in the whole length of the spine. The reason of this arrangement obviously is, that the spinal marrow which is contained in the canal formed by the con- tiguous rings of the twenty-four vertebras, may not be subjected to any injurious pressure or twisting at any one point; and the proof of this remark again is, that when a man has his spine fractured or dislocated, the spinal marrow is either torn through, or pressed upon so as to be unfit for its office, or an inflamma- tion is excited in it, which results in its destruction, so that incur- able palsy, and a piecemeal death, are sooner or later the results. Strong ligaments also pass down the spine in front and behind, binding its different pieces together. A very beautiful adapta- tion of the joints of the spine to the habits of its possessor may bo observed in a cod, salmon, or other large fish, where the op- posed surfaces of the vertebrae will be found hollowed so as to form two cups, between which an almost jelly-like cartilage serves as a ball, thus completing a double bali-and-sockct-joint. In the human spine, because its motions are not required to be so extensive, the resemblance to a ball-and-socket-joint is but remote, yet still the principle on which it is formed is quite the same. Ligaments, it should be stated, are composed of numerous straight fibres collected together, and arranged into short bands o >anous breadth, parallel or radiating, and interwoven with others which cross them, so that they cannot, even on the dis- secting-table, be split up into threads. Sometimes the ligament is so formed as to surround the articular ends of two bones which move upon one another, and here it is called a capsule, or cap- sular ligament. Ligaments are not extensible nor elastic; hence, when any attempt is made to stretch them too far, great pain is the result, and inflammation follows, and they are said to be sprained,—if the force applied be greater still, they may even be entirely ruptured. The different parts of the pelvis are united by means of car- tilage and ligaments, each bone having its articular surface covered with cartilage; and these are laid together, with or without the intervention of a third layer, and are bound firmly by liga- ments passing over them. Such are the joints between the two haunch-bones, and between them and the rump-bone. The joints of the extremities, it has already been remarked, are of a more complicated nature. The ends of the bones en- tering into the joints, having their forms adapted to one another, are covered with cartilage, then they are tied together by liga- ments ; and, in addition, a membrane called synovial, is spread over the ends of the boiies and lines the ligaments, forming a shut bag, whose inner surfaces are everywhere in contact, and to obviate friction are moistened with a bland mucilaginous fluid, called synovia. The synovial membrane has a smooth velvety surface, like the membrane which lines the mouth and nose. The fluid which serves the purpose of oil to the joints, does not, in reality, contain any oil, yet it has very much the feeling of oil when rubbed between the fingers. When it increases too much in quantity it produces dropsy of the joints. The figure in the margin is a plan of a finger joint, one of the simplest of the perfect joints, b b are the two bones; l l, the two side ligaments, which may be felt at the sides of the finger, tying together those parts of the two bones between which there is the least motion. The cartilages are seen marked by cross lines, covering the ends of the bones, r and inside of these, the synovial membrane is seen lining both them and the ligaments. A space is represented within the joint, merely for the sake of making its component parts plainer ; but, in reality, there is no space or cavity within a joint, all the surfaces being in close contact. The structure of articular cartilage has been already described in p. 268 ; it is only necessary here to remark, that it seems to prevent any of that jarring which might be expected to result, were the hard surfaces of bones to be brought with violence im- mediately into contact. The motions permitted in joints maybe referred to four heads; viz., gliding, flexion and extension, circumduction, and rotation. 1st, Gliding is the simple movement of one articular surface upon another, and exists to a greater or less extent in all the joints. In the least moveable joints, as those of the solid parts of the hands and feet this is the only motion which is permitted.

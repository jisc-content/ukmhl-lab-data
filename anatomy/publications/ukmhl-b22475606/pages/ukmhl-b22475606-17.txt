But again, 144 is made up of 100, 40 and 4 ; and 100 contains 8, 12 times and 4 over, 40 contains 8, 6 times and 0 over, 4 contains 8, 0 times* and 4 over. Therefore lOO-J-40-f 4 contains 8, 12-|-5-}-0 times and 4-J- O-j-4 over, or 144 contains 8, 17 times and 8 over. But 8 con- tains 8, 1 time, and therefore 144 contains 17 eights and 1 eight or 18 eights. The proof that 144 8 = 18 is that 18X8= 144, or that the divisor and quotient multiplied together produce the divi dend. o. In applying this principle to other cases of division.it is not necessary actually to separate the dividend into parts before commencing the process : the same may be done more concisely during the working. To illustrate this, let it be required to divide 11115 by 9. The question is to find a number which multiplied by 9 will give 11115; but that number will be ascertained by finding out how often 9 can be subtracted from 11115. We might therefore proceed to subtract 9 continually, as we did 23 a former example, until the dividend is ex- hausted ; but it will obviousl/not affect the result to subtract as many\ines at a time as we may find convenient, tak- ing care to mark at each step how many are taken away. Now we at once see that 11115 is greater than 1000 times 9; we therefore take away 9000 at once ; the quantity 2115 which remains is greater than 200 times 9 (for 9 X 200 = 1800, whereas the remainder has -1 hundreds); we therefore take away 1800 leaving a remainder of 315 ; this remainder again is greater than 30 times 9— 270; this number being subtracted, there remains 45 which 7® kn,ow t0 be 5 times 9. Therefore 11115 contains 9, 1000 4-200 4-30 4-5 times, that is 1235 times. The process is shown on the margin above. In this operation it will be observed that we really separated the dividend 11115 into parts in finding that 11115 = 9000 4- 1800 4- 270 -f 45 and had these parts been known to us previous to commencing the operation, we might have proceeded with the divi- sion as on the margin. 70000, which exceeds 40761. But we observe that 40, the first and second figures together, contains 7 more than 5 times and ess than 6 times; therefore, 40,000 contains 7 more than 5000 times, and less than 6000 times. But 40761 also contains 7 more than 5000 times, for 40761 is greater than 40000 ; it also contains 7 less than 6000 times, because 6000 times 7 is 42000 IZT0" ~Urno-Ltha/“ 407GL We “ay therefore subtract* o000 times 7 = 3o000 from 40761, which leaves a remainder of 5761. The quotient sought is therefore 40761 35000 = 5000 times 7 5000 4-5 7 7 It remains now to 5761 5600 = 800 times 7 161 140 = 20 times 7 315 270 30 times 9 45 45 5 times 9 0 9000 9 1800 9 270 = 1000 200 ~ — 30 Therefore 45 ~9 11115 9 = 1235 J-Jr0m these. ‘lustrations it is obvious that the only difficulty the d vknrUrSt’ 18 "h firdlng r h0W many times we nlay subtract .

Proceeding as before, we ob- serve that 5 does not contain 7, but that 57 does contain it more than 8 times, and less than 9 times ; therefore, 5700 contains it more than 800 times, and less than 900 times; as does 5761; subtracting the 800 times 7, or 5600, there re- mains 161. The quotient is there- fore 5000 4-800 + il1. Now, 16 contains 7 more than 2 times, 21 21 = 3 times 7 0 40761=5823 times 7 and less than three times; therefore, 160 contains 7 more than 20 times,;and less than 30 times; as does also 161 ; subtracting then 20 times 7, or 140, there remains 21. Now, 21 contains 7 just 3 times ; and this being subtracted, the dividend is ex- hausted. We therefore conclude that 40761 = 5000 4-800-}-20 4-3 = 5823. The following examples may be gone over in the same man- ner :— 1656 = 552 5 97587 =13941 3 5 7 7. The same method illustrated above is applicable however great is the divisor. One other example will make this plain ; let it be the following—Divide 4298689 by 576. We here observe, that it takes the four figures on the left of the dividend, namely, 4298, to 4298689 4032000 = 7000 times 576 2G6689 230400 = 400 times 576 make a numberwhich is greater than 576, the divisor: the dividend is therefore separated into 4298000 and 689. Now, 4298 is found to contain 576 more than 7 times, and less than 8 times; therefore 4298000 contains it more than 7000 times, and less than 8000 times; and subtracting 576 X 7000 from the dividend, the remain- der is 266689. The four figures, namely 2666, on the left of this remainder, contain 576 more than 4 times, and less than 5 times, therefore the 36289 34560 = 60 times 576 1729 1728 = 3 times 576 1 remainder. whole remainder contains it more than 400 times, and less than 500 times; and 576 X 400 being subtracted, there arises the new remainder. With this the same operation is repeated until it appears that the quotient is 7000 400 4" 60 -(- 3 and 1 over. 8. It will be observed in examining the foregoing examples, 1st. That it is unnecessary to write the ciphers which are placed hrn VOI on the right of each subtrahend, pro- vided we take care to keep the signi- ficant figures in their proper places without them. 2d. That it is unneces- sary to put down those figures of the dividend which fall over ciphers as they do not begin to be of use in form- ing the quotient until significant figures fall under them ; and 3d. That the figures of the quotient might be written in succession in the usual way. The last example is shown in this abridged form at the side, and it is particularly to be remarked : 1st, Divisor Dividend Quotient. 576)4298689(7463 4032 2666 2304 3628 3456 1729 1728

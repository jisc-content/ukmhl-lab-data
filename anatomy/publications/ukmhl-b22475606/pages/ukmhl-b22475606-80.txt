162 THE IMPERIAL JOURNAL OF Thus, 4 ab X 3 cd X 5 mq might bo written 4 aft 3 cd 5 mq. But as multiplications may be made in any order without affect- ing the numerical result of the operation,* we profit by this circumstance to collect, for the sake of simplicity and symmetry of expression, all the numerical coefficients together by the arithmetical rule. Thus, instead of writing 4 ab 3 cd 5 mq, we write 4'3'5 abcdmq, or CO abcdmq, which is more concise, and in every respect more convenient. It is, however, to be borne in mind, that this is only a conven- tional conveniency ; and that the one form of expression is identical with the other in signification. 13. From this, then, we conclude, that if the quantities! to be multiplied have coefficients, these must be multiplied together as in common arithmetic, and that the literal product must be written consecutively, as directed in the rule, Art. 11. The fol- lowing are examples :— 2 ax X 4 bb X 5 ax = 2 X 4 X 5 ax bb ax — 40 aa bb xx ^ px X 2 pq X 7 ax = £ X 2 X 7 px pq ax = 7 app q xx x pq X 3 p X 3 q = 3 pp qq f XH X £ yz X ! xz = xx yy zz JaiiXfmjXIpvX am = aa mm n p qr. 14. The multiplication of complex quantities is resolvable into the same operation as that explained, as exemplified in arithmetic; when the quantities to be multiplied together consist of several parts, every part of the one must be multiplied by every part of the other, and the sum of all the partial products must be taken as the total product of the two quantities. In algebra, these partial products can be found by the rules given above; although, as we shall presently see, the process presents a peculiarity which is not found in the arithmetical operation. Let it in the first place be required to multiply a-\-b by c, that is, to find c times a -f- b. Here the product of a by c is ac, and the product of b by c is be ; but the product of the sum of a and b by c, is manifestly the sum of the product ac and be; that is ac -J- be. Hence J c times {a -J- 6) = c {a -f- &) = ac -j- be. Again, let it be required to multiply a — b by c; that is, to find c times a — b. The partial products as before are ac and be; but since a is greater than a — b by the quantify b, it is therefore clear that c times a; that is, ac, is greater than c times a — b, by the quantity be; consequently, be must be sub- tracted from ac, which gives ac — be for the product required. Hence c times (a — b) = c (a — 6) — ac — be. The same reasoning clearly applies whatever be the number of terms in the multiplicand. These two cases, therefore, furnish the following rule for the multiplication of a complex quantity, by a quantity of one term ; namely, Write the multiplier into every term of the multiplicand. In the practical application of this rule, we commonly multiply from left to right. The follow- ing is an example :— Multiply ab -f- c — 2 d -f- 3 m — 4 n — qx by 2 z Product 2 abz -)- 2cz — 4 dz -)- 6 mz — 8 nz — 2 qxz. The following exemplify also the use of brackets in this rule .— 2 ax (a -J- 6 — e -f- 1) =2 aax 2 abx — 2 acx -f- 2 ax \xy (x — z) -{-z (1 — s) — | xxy — \ xy -{- z — zz * It must be observed that this proposition is here assumed, not proved; and we may remark, that although so simple as almost to he thought self-evident, no faultless demonstration of it has yet been given. The following is an instance, ah — ba for « x 1=1 xa; that is, a taken 1 time is the same as 1 taken a times ; hut a x b, is b times as great as a x 1, and b x a is also b times as great as 1 x a, which is the same as oxl; therefore ab — ba. This proof may be extended to abc — eba = cab — bca — bac. + By quantities we understand such magnitudes as can be represented by numbers; we may therefore without impropriety speak of their multi- plication and division, hearing in mind, however, that a multiplier is always an abstract (never a concrete) number: the multiplier is the answer to the question, How many times ? J: A quantity written before or after a quantity placed within brackets, is to be multiplied into every term of the enclosed quantity. ab (x — 1) — 6c (1 — x) — cd (1-f-a) = abx — ab — be -f- hex — cd — cdx m — c—-|-1)-j-pp } = amn -(- burn — ernn — dmn -j- mn mpp. 13. When the multiplier is composed of several terms, we have the following cases :— I. Let it be required to multiply a b by c -j- d. Here a -)- b is to be taken c -j- d times, that is c times -J- d times ; now c times a b, is ac -\- be, and d times a -(- b, is ad -f- bd; but c -f- d times a -f- 6 must manifestly be the sum of these partial products; that is, (ac -|- be) -j- {ad -f- bd) which, taking away the brackets, becomes ac -{-be -{- ad -(- bd. 2d. Let it be required to multiply a—b by c-\-d. Here c times a—b by c is ac — be, and d times a — b, is ad —bd ; and the sum of these products is (ab — be)-{-(ad — bd); that is, taking away the brackets, ab — be -{-ad — bd. From these and similar examples then, we conclude that the multiplier being the sum of several terms, the total product sought is composed of the sum of the partial products of the multiplicand by every term of the multiplier. Suppose now that the multiplier contains a subtractive term, it is clear that the products formed by that term, must be taken with a contrary sign to that which they have by the pre- ceding rule. Treating this condition as above, let us inquire, II. What is the product of a -[-6 bye — d? This question is by definition the following : what is c times (a -f- b) — d times (a -j- b) ? Now c times & is ac -f- be, and d times a -f- b, is ad^\-bd; consequently, c times (a -f- 6) — d times (a -J- b) = (ac -[- be) — (ad -f- bd) that is (c — d) times (a -J- 6) = (ac -{-be) — (ad -j- bd) or (a-j-&)X(c — d) = ac -f- be — ad — bd, and this last is therefore the product sought, with the brackets struck out. 2d. What is a — b multiplied by c — d ? The answer to this question must obviously depend upon the same reasoning as that employed in finding the answer to that preceding. We have in the first place— c times (a — b) — d times (a — b) = (ac— be) — (ad — bd) that is, (a —b) X (c — d = ac — be — ad -f- bd by taking away the brackets of the product. From these two, and other like examples, we conclude, that when a term of a multiplier is preceded by the sign —, every partial product formed by that term will have the contrary sign to that of the corresponding term of the multiplicand. 16. The preceding operations and the rules to which they lead, are directly deducible from the principles exemplified in Art. 14. Thus putting c-{-d = m; then (a-j-6) X (e-)-ci) becomes (a -j- b) m — am -j- bm ; and putting for m its value we have am -{-bm a (c -{- d) -{-b (c -{- d) = ac -{-ad -{-be -{- bd Again putting c — d — n : then (a — b) X (c— d) becomes (a — b) n — an —bn ; and putting for n its value we have an — bn = a (c — d) — b (c — d) = ac — ad — be -j- bd. 17- The multiplication of all complex quantities may be reduced to this last case by representing the sum of the positive terms in each of the two factors by a and c respectively, and that of the negative terms similarly by b and d; it then only remains to assign the values of the partial products ac, be, ad, bd. To render this plain, suppose that it is required to multiply 5 x — 3 y -f- 2 z by xy — 2 z. The multiplicand may obviously be written (5 x + 2 z) — 3 y ; let 5 x -)- 2 z — a and 3 y = b then ox — 3 y -{- 2 z r= a — b; similarly put xy = eand 2 z = d; then xy — 2 z — c — d. The product of a — b by c — d is ac — ad — be -1- bd but ac = (5 x + 2 z) X xy = 5 xx y + 2 xy z ad=(5 x-{-2 z)Y. 2 z = \0 xz -{-±zz be = 3 y X xy = 3 xyy and bd = 3yX.2zr=§yz ac—ad—be -{-bd=5 xxyf-2 xyz—( 10 xz-{- 4 zz)—3 xyy\ 6 yz • =6xxy-{-2 xyz—10 xz — 4zz—3 xyy-{-8yz which is the product of 5 a; — 3 y 2 z by xy — 2 z. 18. Observing the results obtained in these cases, we find that

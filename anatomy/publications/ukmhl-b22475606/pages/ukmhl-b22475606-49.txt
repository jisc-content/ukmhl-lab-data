The ankle-joint may be dislocated forwards, or to either side. This never happens without one ol the ankles being broken off, the ligaments being so strong that the bone will break rather than they should give way. The dis- location of the ankle can scarcely take place without a wound coexisting. And here is a suitable opportunity for explaining what is meant by a simple, and what by a compound disloca- tion. A simple dislocation is one where the bones are displaced, but the joint is not laid open ; a compound one need not be more serious in so far as the bones are concerned, but is accompanied with a wound leading into the joint, which, consequently, in- flames and suppurates, and brings the sufferer into great danger of losing his limb, if not his life. In the same way, a simple frac- ture is when a bone is broken without a wound ; a compound one Is where there is a wound communicating with the broken surfaces. The joints across the foot are numerous, and not easily de- scribed in a treatise of this kind. There is one joint across the middle of the tarsus, or solid part of the foot, which, in some persons, admits of a good deal of lateral motion ; and, in such feet, is liable to be sprained. Another joint runs across between the bones of the tarsus and those of the instep. An accurate knowledge of these joints is necessary to the surgeon ; for in those severe accidents which are constantly occurring to the labouring population, where a part of the foot is crushed, he is often enabled to preserve a useful foot, by cutting away the in- jured part, at one of those joints, leaving still the heel to rest upon, and an artificial apparatus is adapted to the stump, to re- present the anterior part of the foot. The joints of the toes re- quire nothing particular to be said of them—only that they are similar to those of the fingers, but much smaller. In persons who drink much wine, they are apt to become affected with gout; and in elderly people, the joint at the ball of the great toe is apt to be drawn, so as to make an ugly projection on the inner side of the foot—become exposed to pressure from the shoe, and so produce a corn, which, from its situation, is incurable. The most common disease of joints is their inflammation Sometimes this is acute, as after injuries, or from rheumatism The synovial bag becomes inflamed, and forms an inordinate quantity of fluid, which distends the joint enormously. It is ac- companied with intense redness and acute pain, and requires bleeding and other such treatment, to reduce it. In scrofulous persons, the inflammation does not assume this acute form, but is low and long-continued ; the synovial membrane forms puru- lent matter, instead of merely an increased quantity of its natu- ral secretion ; the matter gradually works its way to the surface, making one or two ulcerated openings, leading directly into the joint ; and, by and by, the cartilages are destroyed—so that, if a probe be introduced, the ends of the bone are felt to be bare and rough. In this state the patient’s general health suffers much ; he becomes affected with shiverings, profuse night-sweats, and purgings, and unless the limb were amputated, he would speedily die. In the cases of the shoulder and elbow, an opera- tion has come much into use within the last twenty years, by which an incision is made through the skin, and the diseased ends af the bones cut out; a new false joint forms, and the use of the limb is, in a great measure, recovered. MATHEMATICS. CHAPTER IX. abbreviations in the multiplication and division of DECIMAL FRACTIONS. Tim rules already given for the operations of multiplication and division of decimals, are generally applicable ; but it fre- quently happens that the work is more laborious than is neces- sary to obtain the degree of accuracy which the results are re- quired to have. Thus, supposing it is required to find the pro- duct of 5-247 multiplied by 3 365, true to two places of decimals only, the rule given does not furnish us with any other mode of proceeding than that of making the full multiplication, and after- wards abridging the result. The actual result is 5 217 X 3-3G5 = 17 656155, which, made true to two places, is 17"66. Here, then, we have found four places of decimals more than were wanted. It might, at first sight, appear that this superfluous labour might be somewhat abridged, by abridging our multiplicand and multiplier previous to making the multiplication. Were we to attempt such a modification of the process, it would be at the expense of accuracy. Thus, supposing we reduce our factors by one place each, and make the multiplication, we then have 5-25 X 3-37 = 17-6925. Here we have still two places more than are wanted ; and, what is more, the second place is incorrect. The reason of this is very obvious. The error introduced by taking 5-25, instead of 5 "2 4 7, has been taken 3 37 times, and the error made by taking 3’37, instead of 3’365, has been taken 5'25 times ; and the pro- duct, 17'6925, contains the sum of these multiplied errors. The sum of these errors is '036345,* which, taken from 17"6925, leaves 17"G56155, the product found by the first process. But we have only been able to make the correction by a knowledge of the original errors. This mode is, then, both laborious and deficient in point of accuracy. To replace it by a rule which has neither of these defects, it is, however, necessary, in the first place, to premise that in any case of multiplication, we may write the figures of the multiplier in a contrary order—(for example, 1635, instead of 5361)—provided that, in the operation, we move each line one place to the right instead of moving it to the left. This is shown in the following instance, in which the operation is given at full length, according to both methods : Common Method. 31215 5361 31215 187290 93645 156075 With Multiplier inverted. 31215 1635 156075 93645 187290 31215 167343615 167343615 The results are here the same ; and the reason is at once obvious, from an inspection of the two processes. Suppose now that we wish to multiply 5'247 by 3"365, in such a way as to obtain a product correct to two places of decimals, we have only to apply this principle, talcing care to place that figure in the reversed multiplier, which occupied the unit’s place, immediately under the second place of decimals in the multipli- cand. The process is written below. Here we have cut off, by a vertical line, the four places of decimals which are not wanted in the result. But it is very plain that had we neglected these figures entirely, our product would have been faulty ; for, looking at the first column on the left of the vertical line, we find 4, 7, 1, 2, of which the first figure, 4, comes fromf 4'X 3" ; the 7, from 2' X 3" ; the 1, from 5' X 6" ; and the 2, from 0' X 5"—together with the carriage from the pre- ceding multiplications. Were it not, then, that there are certain figures to be carried from right 6.247 5633 1574 1 157 41 31 482 2 6235 17-65 6155 * This is not strictly the sum of the errors referred to, but the real amount of error committed—which, expressed generally, is Aa + B 5 — ab, where A and B are the altered factors, and a and b the errors of alteration. As a and b are, however, very small, a b may he neglected, since it must be greatly smaller than either a or b. Thus, in the example, a =-003 and b = -005; therefore, a i =-000015. The following is a very simple rule for judging how far a product obtained from two contracted factors can be relied upon. Thus, taking A and B as the factors, if they are true to only one decimal place, then their product is within A ; of the truth; if they are true to two decimal places, then the product is within——; if to three, within A "I and so on. Thus, taking the values of A and B, in the 2000 5*25 4- 3*37 example, which are true to two places, we have =’0431, for the possible error in their product, 17-6925; so that the true answer must be between 17-6925 —-0431 = 17 6494, and 17-6925 -f *0431 = 177356; but at what point the rule does not enable us to determine. f The ' means that the figure over which it is placed is in the multiplicand, and ", that is in the multiplier.

SCAPULO-CLAVICULAR JOINT. 173 The conoid ligament, the posterior and intei'nal fasciculus, is a dense band of fibres, conical in form, the base being turned upwards, the summit downwards. It is attached by its apex to a rough depression at the base of the coracoid process, internal to the preceding; above, by its expanded base, to the conoid tubercle on the under surface of the clavicle, and to a lino proceeding internally from it for half an inch. These ligaments are in relation, in front, with the Subclavius ; behind, with the Trapezius: they serve to limit rotation of the scapula forwards and backwards. The Interartioular Fibro-Oartilage is most frequently absent in this articulation. When it exists, it generally only partially separates the articular surfaces, and occupies the upper part of the articulation. More rarely, it completely separates the joint into two cavities. 131.—The Left Shoulder-Joint, Scapulo-Clavicukr Articulations and Proper Ligaments of Scapula. _ There are koo Synovial Memlranes when a complete interarticular cartilac^e exists ; more frequently there is only one synovial membrane Ackons The movements of this articulation are of two kinds, i. A gliding motion of the articular end of the clavicle on the acromion. 2. Rotation of th! scapula forwards and backwards upon the clavicle, t»e extent of this rotation beino- limited by the two portions of the coraco-clavicular ligament.

Similar to that of the other long bones. Developmmt. Bj three centres: one for the shaft, one for the inferior extremity, and one for the olecranon (fig. 92). Ossification commences near the middle of the shaft about the fifth week, and soon extends through the greater part of the bone. At birth the ends are cartilaginous. About the fourth year, a separate osseous nucleus appears in the middle of the head, which soon extends into the styloid process. About the tenth year, ossific matter appears in the olecranon near its exti-emity, the chief part of this process being formed from an extension of the shaft of the bone into it. At about the sixteenth year, the upper epiphysis becomes joined, and at about the twentieth year the lower one. Articulaiions. With the humerus and radius. Attachmejit of Muscles.

The Radius is situated on the outer side of the foi-earm, lying parallel with the ulna, which exceeds it in length and size. Its upper end is small, and forms only a small part of the elbow-joint; but its lower end is large, and forms the chief part of the wrist. It is one of the long bones, prismatic in form, slightly curved tjctrf""" ■ longitudinally, and like other long mi bones has a shaft and two extremities. .rrv T- fr'' ™''''^y Presents a head, neck, and tuberosity.

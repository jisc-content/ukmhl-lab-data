HEART—LEFT AURICLE. 659 The mius is cuboidal in form, and concealed in front by the pulmonary artery and aorta; intex-nally, it is separated from the right auncle by the septum aurxcu- larum ; behind, it receives on each side the pulmonary vems, being free xn the rest ^Tappendh auncvU is somewhat constricted at its junction with the auricle; it is loLTx^narrower, and more curved than that of the right side, and xts margms more deVy -Rented, presenting a kind of foliated appearance Its d:rect^n xs forwards and towards the right side, overlapping the root of the pulmonary artery. In order to exnmino its interior, ft horizontal incision should be made along J^t^J^^^j^ border of the amide to the ventiicle j and from the middle of this, a second incisiou should be carried upwards. The following parts then present themselves for examination :— The openings of the four pulmonary veins. Auriculo-ventricular opening. Musculi pectinati. The puhnonary veins, four in number, open, two into the right, and two into the left side of the auricle. The two left veins frequently terminate by a common opening. They are not provided with valves. 359.—The Left Auricle and Ventricle laid open, the anterior Walls of both being removed. BrlrilfjaasarJ ihrm •ricuJo^ertCn The auriculo-ventricular opening is the large oval aperture oiF communication between the auricle and ventricle. It is rather smaller than the corresponding opening on the opposite side. The musculi pectinati &xe fewer in number and smaller than on the right side ; they are confined to the inner surface of the appendix. On the inner surface of the septum auricularum may be seen a lunated impres- sion, bounded below by a crescentic ridge, the concavity of which is turned up- wards. The depression is just above the fossa ovalis in the right auricle. u 'J 2

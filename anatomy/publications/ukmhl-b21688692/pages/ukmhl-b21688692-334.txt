Of the lio-aments, the internal, or deltoid, is of very great power-so much so that it usually resists a force which fr-actm^es the process of bone to which it is attached, lis middle portion together with the middle fasciculus of the external lateral ligament, binds the bones of the leg firmly to the foot and resists displacement in every direction. Its anterior and posterior fibres limit extension .and flexion of the foot * The fact should be remembered in operative surgery.

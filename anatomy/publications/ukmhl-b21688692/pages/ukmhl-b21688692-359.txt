SUPERFICIAL CERVICAL REGION, 223 This muscle divides the quadrilateral space at the side of the neck mto two triangles, an anterior and a posterior. The boundaries of the animo. Wangle are front, the median line of the neck; above, the lower border of IJe body of the jaw, and an imaginary line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process behind, the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid muscle. The boundaries of thej;o.W triangle are, in front, the posterior border o the Sterno-mastoid; below, the upper border of the clavicle; behind, the anterior margin of the Trapezius. * I s3.â€”Muscles of the Neck, and Boundaries of the Triangles. The anterior edge of the muscle forms a very prominent ridge beneath the skin, which it is important to notice, as it forms a guide to the surgeon in making the necessary incisions for ligature of the common carotid artery, and for cesophagotomy. Belations. By its superficial surface, with the integument and Platysma, from which it is separated by the external jugular yein, the superficial branches of the cervical plexus, and the anterior layer of the deep cervical fascia. By its deep surface, it rests on the sterno-clavicular articulation, the deep'layer of the cervical fascia, the Sterno-hyoid, Sterno-thyroid, Omo-hyoid, the posterior belly of the Digastric, Levator anguli scapute, the- Splenius and Scaleni muscles. Below, it is in relation with the lower part of the common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, pneumogastric, descendens noni and communicans noni nerves, and with the deep lymphatic glands; with the spinal accessory nerve, which pierces its upper third, the cervical plexus, the occipital artery, and a part of the parotid gland. Nerves. The Platysma myoides is supplied by the facial and superficial branches * The anatomy of these triangles will be more exactly described with that of the vessels ot the neck.

232 MUSCLES AND FASCIA. The Levator Palati is a long, thick, rounded muscle, placed on ihe outer side of the posterior nares. It arises from the under surface of the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and fVom the adjoining cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube; alter passing into the pliarynx, above the upper concave margin of the Superior constrictor, it descends obHqucly downwards and mwards, its fibres spreadi^ig out in the posterior surface of the soft palate as far as the middle lino, where they blond with those of the opposite side. Uelations Externally, with the Tensor palati and Superior constrictor. Mei- mlh, with the mucous membrane of the pharynx. Posteriorly, with the mucous iW of the soft palate. This muscle must be removed and the pterygoid attachment of the Superior constrictor dissected away, in order to expose the next â„¢he Oircumflexns ov Tensor Palatii. a broad, thin, riband-like muscle, placed on the outer side of the preceding, and consisting of a vertical and a horizontal porttn The vertical portion arises by abroad, thin, a^d flat lamella from the scaXid fossa at the base of the internal pterygoid plate, its ongxn extending as F WV-is thesTDineof the sphenoid; it also arises from the anterior aspect of c^^til^^^^^^^^^^^ tlfe Eustachian tube; descending vertically between the internal pteiygoid plate and the inner surfoce of the Internal pterygoid muscle iUerminates'^inrtendon which winds round the hamular process, being retained in thrs'uation by some of the fibres of origin of the Internal P^^Tgo^d -u^^^.

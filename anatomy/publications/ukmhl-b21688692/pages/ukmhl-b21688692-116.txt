Bevelupment of the spine.—The first trace of the future spinal column is found at a very early period of foetal life, constituti ig the chorda clorsalis or notochm-d (Fig. XLVIII.). This is a cylindrical tube, composed of a transparent sheath, containing embryonic cells, and extending from the cephalic to the caudal extremity of the fcetus below the spinal canal. The protovertehroB or primitive vertehrce appear early, as dark spots, which soon enlarge and form quadrangular laminse, one on either side of the chorda dorsalis, commencing in the cervical region. These spread out and bend towards each other, so as to come into contact around the spinal canal and enclose it, forming the rudiment of the future bodies and arches of the vertebrse, as weU as of the vertebral and other muscles. This primitive vertebral column is, however, entirely membranous until about the sixth or seventh week, when cartilage begins to be deposited in it. The proto- vertebrse do not coincide with the permanent vertebrEe. On the contrary, each primitive vertebra separates into two parts, the upper part belonging to the permanent vertebra, which lies above the point of separation, and the lower one to that below. The chorda dcrsalis becomes gradually atrophied, except at the part corresponding to the intervals between the permanent vertebrse, where it forms the intervertebral discs. The par- ticular facts relating to the ossification of the spinal column wiU be found at pp. lO et seq. Development of the cranium in general, and oftheface.-The foetal cranium is developed from the primitive vertebral discs surrounding the upper extremity of the chorda dorsalis. These advance in the form of a mem- branous capsule, which covers the end of the chorda dorsalis, forming the rudiment of the base of the skull, and moulds itself on the cerebra vesicles, so as to constitute the membrane in which the vault of the skuU is developed. The membranous capsule presents at the base of the skniU two thickenings (lateral trabecule of Eathke) directed forwards, and enclosing an opening (pituitary opening) which is partly closed by a thinner membrane-the middle trabecula. The upper end of the chorda dorsalis terminates in a pointed extremity, which extends about as far forwards as the body of the sphenoid bone, where it becomes lost abou the tTation of the pituitary body, ^^^^^f^^^^^^^^^^^^ cartilao-e in the part corresponding to the base of the skull and the tra b"ut!

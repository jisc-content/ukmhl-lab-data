The colourless elements consist of granular matter; nuclei, about the size ot the red blood-discs, homogeneous or granular in structure; and nucleated vesicles m 354,_The Malpigliian Corpuscles, and their Eelaiion with the Splenic Artery jiud its JSranches. small numbers. These elements form, probably, one-half or two-thii'ds of the whole substance of the pulp, filling up the interspaces formed by the partitions of the spleen, and lying in close contact with the walls of the capillary vessels, so as to be readily acted upon by the nutrient fluid which permeates them. Thus in well-nourished animals, they form a large part of the entire bulk of the spleen, whilst they diminish in number, and occasionally are wanting in starved animals. The application of chemical tests show that they are essentially a proteine compound. The coloured elements of the pulp consist of red blood-globules and of coloured corpuscles, either free, or included in cells. Sometimes, unchanged blood-discs are seen included in a cell; but more frequently the included blood-discs are

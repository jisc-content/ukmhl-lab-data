56 THE SKELETON. mental foramen, for the passage of the mental nerve and artery. This foramen is placed just below the root of the second bicuspid tooth. Running outwards from the base of the mental process on each side, is a well-marked ridge, the extei-nal oblique line. The ridge is at first nearly horizontal, but afterwards inclines up- wards and backwards, and is continuous with the anterior border of the ramus; it afibrds attachment to the Depressor labii inferioris and Depressor anguli oris, below which the Platysma myoides is inserted. The internal surface (fig. 57) is concave from side to side, convex from above downwards. In the middle line is an indistinct linear depression, corresponding to the symphysis externally ; on either side of this depression, just below its centre, are four prominent tubercles, placed in pairs, two above and two below; they are called the genial tubercles^ and afford attachment, the upper pair to the Genio-hyo- glossi muscles, the lower pair to the Genio-hyoidei muscles. Sometimes the tubercles on each side are blended into one, or they all unite into an irregular eminence of bone, or nothing but an irregularity may be seen on the surface of the bone at this part. On either side of the genial tubercles is an oval depression, the sublingual fossa, for lodging the sublingual gland; and beneath the fossa, a 57.â€”Inferior Maxillaiy Bone. Inner Surface.

At the back part of the sublingual fossa, the internal obhque line (mylo-hyoidean) commences ; it is at first faintly marked, but becomes more distinct as it passes upwards and outwards, and is especially promment opposite the last two molar teeth ; it affords attachment throughout its whole extent to the JSlylo- hyoid muscle, the Superior constrictor of the pharynx with the pterygo-maxUlary ligament, being attached above its posterior extremity, nearer the alveolar margm. The portion of bone above this ridge is smooth, and covered by the mucous membrane of the mouth ; whilst that below it presents an oblong depression, the submaxillary fossa, wider behind than in front, for the lodgment of the submaxillary gland. The external oblique line and the internal or mylo-hyoidean line divide the body of the bone into a superior or alveolar, and an inferior or basilar portion. The sicperior or alveolar border is wider, and its margins thicker behind thaai m front. It is hollowed into numerous cavities, for the reception of the teeth ; these cavities are sixteen in number, and vary in depth and size accordmg to the teetH which they contain. To its outer side, the Buccinator muscle is attached as tar

There is one between the sides of the scaphoid and caboid; a second between the internal and middle cuneiform bones ; a third between the middle and external cuneiform ; and a fourth between the external canoiform and cuboid. The scaphoid and cuboii, when in contact, present each a small articulatmg facet, covered with cartilage, and lined either by a separate synovial membrane, or by an olfset fiom the great tarsal synovial membrane. 3.

The Internal Galcaneo-Guhoid (Inter- osseous) Ligament (fig. 144) is a short, but thick and strong, band of fibres, arising from the os calcis, in the deep groove which intervenes between it and the astragalus ; and closely blended, at its origin, with the superior calcaneo- scaphoid ligament. It is inserted into the inner side of the cuboid bone. This ligament forms one of the chief bonds of union between the first and second row of the tarsus. The Lo7ig Gahaneo-Guboid (fig. 145), the more superficial of the two plantar ligaments, is the longest of all the liga- ments of the tarsus ; it is attached to the under surface of the os calcis, from near the tuberosities, as far forwards as the anterior tubercle ; its fibres pass forwards to be attached to the ridge on the under surface of the cuboid bone, the more su- perficial fibres being continued onwards to the basis of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. This ligament crosses the groove on the under^ surface of the cuboid bone, converting it into a canal for the passage of the tendon of the Peroneus longus. , „„^;ntr The Short Galcaneo-Guhoid Ligament lies nearer to the bones than the P^^^'^^^^S' from which it is separated by a little areolar adipose tissue.

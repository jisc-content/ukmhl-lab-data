52 THE SKELETON. superior turbinated crest is a narrow horizontal groove, wbich forms part of the superior meatus. i p The external surface is rough and irregular throughout the greater part ot its extent, for articulation with the inner surface of the superior maxillary bone, its upper and back part being smooth where it enters into the formation of the spheno-maxillary fossa; it is also smooth in front, where it covers the onfice of the antrum. Towards the back part of this surface is a deep groove, converted into a canal, the posterior palatine, by its articulation with the superior maxillary bone. It transmits the posterior, or descending palatine vesse s, and a large nerve The anterior border is thin, irregular, and presents opposite the inferior turbinated crest a pointed projecting lamina, the maxillary process which is directed forwards and closes in the lower and back part of the opening of the antrum, being received into a fissure that exists at the inferior part of this aperture. The posterior border Cfiff qo) presents a deep groove, the edges of which are serrated for articulation wifh the pterygoid process of the sphenoid. At the low^ part of thisJ^order is seen a pvramidal process of bone, the pterygoid process or tuberosity of the palate which is received into the angular interval between the two pterygoid plates of the sphenoid at their "inferior extremity. This process presents at its b^k part three grooves, a median and two lateral ones. The former is smooth, and forms part of the pterygoid fossa, affording attachment to the Internal pterygoid muscle; whilst the lateral grooves are rough and uneven, for articulation with the anterior border of each pterygoid plate. A few fibres of the External pterygoid muscle also arise from the tuberosity of the palate bone. The base of this process continuous with the horizontal portion of the bone, presents the apertures of the accesso^ descending palatine canals ; whilst its outer surface is rough for articulation with the inner surface of the body of the superior maxillary bone. . , The superior border of the vertical plate presents two well-marked processes separated by an intervening notch or foramen. The anterior, or larger, is called the orbital process; the ^OBi^riov,ihe sphenoidal. _ nr. a hiVher The OM Process, directed upwards and outwards is p aced on a higher level than the sphenoidal. It presents five surfaces, which enclose a ^^^^^J/^^^^^^^^^ lar cavity and is connected to the perpendicular plate by a narrow constricted nik Of these five surfaces, three are articular, two non-ai.icular or -f^^^^^^ The three articular are the anterior or mcu^Ua^y -^f^^'Jortt^^^^^^^^^ wards, outwards, and downwards, is of an oblong form, and rough for ai-ticulation with the superior maxillary „ , . tt- / u,.„p^\ Le.

It ordinarily presents a small open cell, which communicates with the sphenoidal sinus, and the margins of which are ser- rated for articulation with the vertical part of the sphenoidal turbinated bone. The internal or ethmoidal surface is directed inwards, upwards, and forwards, and articulates with the lateral mass of the ethmoid bone. In some cases, the cellular cavity above-mentioned opens on this surface of the bone; it then communicates with the posterior ethmoidal cells. More rarely it opens on both surfaces, and then communicates both with the SjilicnoitJal /irocas yea. articmltiJ- ^vre. Arvcoc OVUL* ORiZONTAL PLATE

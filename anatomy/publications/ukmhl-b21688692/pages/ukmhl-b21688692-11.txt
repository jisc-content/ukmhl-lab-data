PREFACE THE TO SEVENTH EDITION. npmS EDITION hfis received a most careful revision botli of the text and of the sections on Visceral Anatomy. In the former department of the work the Editor has to acknowledge the very vahiable assistance received from his friend, Professor Darling-, of New York University, who has been so kind as to commimicate to him all the verbal and other errors which he has noted in the course of several years during which he has used ' Gray's Anatomy' as the text-book for his class. For other assistance the Editor is indebted to his former pupil, Mr. E, J. Spitta, late Demonstrator of Anatomy at the School of St. George's Hospital, by whom the section on the Ana- tomy of the Kidney in the present edition has been entirely re-written. The illustrations which have been incorporated in this edition from the ' Handbook for the Physiological Laboratory ' are from original drawings by Dr. Kleix. 18 Great CiainERLAXD Place: Dcceniher 1874,

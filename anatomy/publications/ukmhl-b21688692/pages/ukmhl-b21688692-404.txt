The fragments being removed, the tendons of the posterior Scapular muscles will be fully exposed, and can be examined. A block should be placed beneath the shoulder-joint, so as to make the muscles tense. The siq:)raspinous aponeurosis is a thick and dense membranous layer, which completes the osseo-fibrous case in which the Supraspinatus muscle is contained; ailbrding attachment, by its inner surface, to some of the fibres of the muscle.

When this fascia is removed, the Supraspinatus muscle is exposed.

cxxvi GENERAL ANATOMY. communicating witli the part of the aUantois afterwards converted into : the Wadder. As the future uriniferous tubes grow they become convo- ' luted, so that the whole subst-.uico of the kidney seems at first t(; resemble cortical tissue. Then the ends of the tubes become straight, and the pyramidal structure is developed. The suprarenal bodies are formed independently both of the kidneys and Wolffian bodies. ' , , ji 4i • i The Wolf an lochi, or primordial kidney, is perceptible about the third week forming a mass of cells which soon give rise to a hollow organ, situated on either side of the primitive vertebrte, and extending from the heart to the lower end of the embryo, terminating above in a mUU-mc and openiuo- befow into the bladder. The structure of the Wolffian body is m many respects analogous to that of the permanent kidney. It is composed partly of an excretory canal into which opeu numerous' conduits,' rectilinear at first, but afterwards tortuous, and partly of a cellular or glandular struc- ture in which Malpighian tufts are found. It is fixed to the diaphragm by a superior ligament, and to the spinal column by an inferior or lumbar lio-ament. Its office is the same as that of the kidneys, viz., to secrete fluid containing urea, which accumulates in the bladder. Wlien the permanent kidneys are formed, the greater part of the Wolffian body disappears. The rest takes part in the formation of the genital organs. ^ The Internal genital organs have at first no distinctive signs ot sex. i hey are developed from the Wolffian body, the genital gland, and the conduit of MliUer. The genital glands are masses of cells which are formed towards the sixth week of fcetal life. They are produced from the middle blasto- dermic layer, and lie on the inside of the Wolffian body, to which they ^ attached by a mesenteric layer of peritoneum. The conduit of Muller or genital duct, is formed at the same time as the genital gland and like it from the middle blastodermic layer. It is at first a mere cellular cord and then represents a canal, the upper part of which is closed; the lower opens into the bladder. It lies internal and anterior to the duct ot '"^T^ttll pint no difference of sex is perceptible ; but fi-om this stage, towards the commencement of the third month, the internal organs of the female and male begin to assume a different appearance.

CLAVICLE. 85 convex, nearly subcntaneous, being covered only by the Plafcysma ; bat correspond- ing to the inner half of the bone, it is divided by a more or less prominent lino into two parts : an anterior portion, elliptical in form, rough, and slightly convex, for the attachment of the Pectoralis major; and an upper part, which is rough behind, for the attachment of the Steruo-cleido-mastoid. Between the two musculai- impressions is a small subcutaneous interval. The posterior or cervical surface is smooth, flat, directed vertically, and looks backwards towards the root of the neck. It is limited, above, by the superior border; below, by the sub- clavian border; internally, by the margin of the sternal extremity; externally, it is continuous with the posterior border of the flat portion. It is concave fi-om within outwards, and is in relation, by its lower part, with the suprascapular vessels. It gives attachment, near the sternal extremity, to part of the Sterno- hyoid muscle; and presents, at or near the middle, a foramen, directed obhquely outwards, which transmits the chief nutrient artery of the bone. Sometimes, there are two foramina on the posterior surface, or one on the posterior, the other on the inferior surface. The inferior or subclavian surface is bounded, in front, by the anterior border ; behind, by the subclavian border. It is narrow internally, 82.—Left Clavicle. Anterior Surface.. 83.—Left Clavicle.

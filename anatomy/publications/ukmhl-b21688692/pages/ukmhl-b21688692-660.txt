The Spinal Nerves. THE spinal nerves are so called, because tbey take tbeir origin from tbe spinal cord, and are transmitted through the intervertebral foramina on either side of the spinal column. There ai^o thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves, which are arranged into the following groups, corresponding to the region of tlie spine, through which they pass :— Cervical Dorsal Lumbar Sacral Coccygeal 8 pairs. 12 „ 5 • .> 5 >. It will be observed, that each group of nerves corresponds in number with the vertebrce in that region, except the cervical and coccygeal. Bacb spinal nerve arises by two roots, an anterior, or motor root, and a posterior, or sensory root. Roots of the Spinal Nerves. The anterior roots arise somewhat irregularly from a linear series of foramina, on the antero-lateral column of the spinal cord, gradually approaching towards tbe anterior median fissure as they descend. The fibres of the anterior roots, according to the researches of Dr. Lockhart Clarke, are attached to the anterior part of the antero-lateral column; and, after penetrating horizontally through the longitudinal fibres of this tract, enter the ^rey substance, where their fibrils cross each other and diverge m all directions, Hke the expanded hairs of a brush, some of them running more or less longi- tudinally upwards and downwards, and others decussating with those of the opposite side through the anterior commissure in front of the central canal K511iker states that many fibres of the anterior root enter the lateral column of the same side, where, turning upwards, they pursue their course as longitudinal fibres. In other respects, the description of tbe origin of the anterior roots by these observers is very similar. The posterior roots are all attached immediately to the posterior white columns only ■ but some of them pass through the grey substance into both the lateral and anterior white columns. Within the grey substance, they run, longitudinany, upwards and downwards, transversely, through the posterior commissure to the opposite side, and into the anterior column of their own side The posterior roots of the nerves are larger, but the individual filamente are finer and more delicate than those of the anterior. As their component fibrils pass outwards, towards the aperture in the dura mater, they coalesce into two bundles, receive a tubular sheath from that membrane, and enter the ganglion which is developed upon each root. Ti.e posterior root of the first cervical nerve forms an exception to these chiracters It is smaller than the anterior, has frequently no ganglion developed nnon it and when the ganglion exists, it is often situated within the dura mater. ' The ant; or roots are the smaller ;f the two, devoid of any ganglionic enlarge- ment their component fibrils are collected into two bundles, near the inter- vertebral foramina.

ARTICULATIONS. 156 below, to the upper edge of the laminas of the axis. This ligament supplies iho place of the ligamenta aubflava, and is in relation, behind, with the Inferior oblique- muscles. 118. Occipito-Atloid and Atlo-Axoid Ligaments, Posterior View, The Transverse Ligament* (figs. 119, 120) is a thick and strong ligamentous band, which arches across the ring of the atlas, and serves to retain, the odontoid process in firm connection with its anterior arch. This Hgament is flattened from [19.â€”Articulation between Odontoid Process and Atla.s, before backwards, broader and thicker in the middle than at either extremity, and firmly attached on each side of the atlas to a small tubercle on the inner surface * It has been foimd necessary to describe the transverse hgament with those of the atlas and axis ; but the student must remember that it is really a portion of the mechanism by which the movements of the head on the spine arc regulated; so that the connections between the atlas and axis ought always trfbe studied together with those betweeu the latter bones and the skull.

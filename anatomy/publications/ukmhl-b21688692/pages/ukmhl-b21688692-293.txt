As it crosses the odontoid process, a small fasiculus is derived from its upper and lower boi-dors ; the former passing upwards, to bo inserted into the basilar process of tlio occipital bone; the latter, downwards, to be attached to the root of the odontoid process ; hence, the whole ligament has received the name of cruciform. The transverse ligament divides the ring of the atlas into two unequal parts: of these, the posterior and larger serves for the transmission of the cord and its membranes : the anterior and smaller contains the odontoid process. Since the lower border of the space between the anterior arch of the atlas and the transverse ligament is smaller than the upper (because the transverse ligament embraces firmly the narrow neck of the odontoid process), this process is retained in firm connection with, "the atlas when all the other ligaments have been divided. The Oapsular Ligaments are two thin and loose capsules, connecting the articular surfaces of the atlas and axis, the fibres being strongest on the anterior and external part of tke articulation. 120.—I Occipito-Axoid and Atlo-Axoid Ligaments.

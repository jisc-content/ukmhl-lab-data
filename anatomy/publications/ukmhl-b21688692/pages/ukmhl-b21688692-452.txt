It arises from the middle third of the external surface of the shaft of the fibula, internal to the Peroneus longus ; from the anterior and posterior borders of the bone ; and from the inLcrnn.Hcular septa separating it from the adjacent muscles on the front and back part of the leg. The iibres pass vertically downwards, and terminate in a tendon, which runs in front of that of the precsding muscle through the same o-roove, behind the external malleolus, being contained in the same fabrons sheath and lubricated by the same synovial membrane ; it then passis through a , separ'ite sheath on the outer side of the os calcis, above that for the tendon of the Peroneus longus, and is finally inserted into the dorsal surface of the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, on its outer side. ^ .t. . • Belaiioris.

The Peroneus longus and brevis are supplied by the musculo-cutaneous branch of the external popliteal nerve. Actions The Peroneus longus and brevis extend the foot upon the leg, in con- iunction with the Tibialis posticus, antagonising the Tibialis anticus and Peroneus tertius which are flexors of the foot. The Peroneus longus also everts the sole of the foot: hence the extreme eversion occasionally observed m fracture ot the lower end of the fibula, where that bone offers do resistance to the action ot this muscle Taking their fixed point below, the Peronei serve to steady the leg upon the foot This is especially the case in standing upon one leg, when the tendency of the superincumbent weight is to throw the leg inwards : the Peroneus longus overcomes this tendency, by drawing on the outer side of the leg, and thus main- tains the perpendicular direction of the limb. ^urmcal Anatomy.

Organs of Digestion. TiHB Apparatus for the digestion of tlae food consists of the alimentaiy canal, and of certain accessory organs. The alimcntani canal is a musculo-membranous tube, about thirty feet in length, extending from the mouth to the anus, and lined throughout its entire extent by mucous membrane. It has received different names in the various pai-ts of its course: at its commencement, the mouth, we find provision made for the mechanical division of the food (mastication), and for its admixture with a fluid secreted by the salivary glands (insalivation) ; beyond this are the organs of de- glutition, the pharynx and the oesophagus, which convey the food into that part of the alimentary canal (the stomach) in which the principal chemical changes occur ; in the stomach, the reduction and solution of the food takes place ; in the small intestines, the nutritive principles of the food (the chyle) are sepai'ated, by its admixtore with the bile and pancreatic fluid, from that portion which passes into the large intestine, most of which is expelled from the system.

It is bounded, in front, by the lips ; laterally, by the cheeks and the alveolar pro- cesses of the upper and lower jaws ; above, by the hard palate and teeth of the upper jaw; below, by the tongne, and by the mucous membrane stretched between the under surface of that organ and the inner surface of the jaws, and by the teeth of the lower jaw ; behind, by the soft palate and fauces. The mucous membrane lining the mouth, is continuous with the integument at the free margm of the lips, and with the mucous lining of the fauces behind: it is of a rose-pink tmge during life, and very thick where it covers the hard parts bounding the cavity. ^ The Lips are two fleshy folds, which surround the orifice of the mouth, formed ?o1n?tijo V r" ' ' T'T^^^ ^^'^""^ membrane, between ^hich is Z^itl7^ °™ Tit' 1'^' «°™^-^y vessels, some nerves, areolar tissue, 2tJfin fh« ITl' ^^^^^1 S^^-^^^' The inner surface of each Hp is con!

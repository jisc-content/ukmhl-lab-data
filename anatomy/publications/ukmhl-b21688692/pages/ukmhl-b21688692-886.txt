SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PERINEUM. 75° TIio superficial and transverse perinii3al arteries are described at p. 404 ; and the superficial porimeal and inferior pudendal nerves at jjp. 549, 551. The muscles of tbe porina3um in the female are, the Spliincter vaginas. Compressor urethrss. Erector clitoridis. Spliincter ani. Transvcrsus periniDi. Levator ani. Coccygous. The Sphincler VcujincB surrounds the orifice of the vagina, and is analogous to the Accelerator iirinro in the male. It is attached, posteriorly, to the central tendon of the perinieum, where it blends with the Sphincter ani. Its fibres pass forward on each side of the vagina, to be inserted into tbe corpora cavernosa and body of the clitoris. The Erector Clitoridis resembles the Erector penis in the male, but is smaller than it. The Transversus Perinmi is inserted into the side of the Sphincter vaginas, and the Levator ani into the side of the vagina. The other muscles are precisely similar to those in the male. The Accelerator uriuiB and Erector penis muscles should now be removed, when the deep perinjeal fascia will be exposed, stretching across the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. The urethra is seen perforating its centre, just behind the bulb; and on either side is the crus penis, connecting the corpus cavernosum with the ramus of the ischium and pubes. 407.—Deep Perinaeal Fascia. On the left side, the anterior hiyer has been removed. The Deep PervncBal Fascia (triangular ligament), is a den.se membranous lamina, which closes the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. It is triangular in shape, about an inch and a half in depth, attached above, by its apex, to the under surface of the symphysis pubis and subpubic ligament; and, on each side, to the rami of the ischium and pubes, bcnt-ath the crura penis. Its inferior

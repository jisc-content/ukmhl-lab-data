256 MUSCLES AND FASCIA. Mercodal Fascia:. A tliin bvit firm layer of fascia covers the outer surface of the l^Jxtcrnal intercostal and tlio inner surface of the Internal intercostal muscles; and a third layer, more delicate, is interposed between the two planes of muscular fibres Those are the intercostal fascifB ; they are best marked m those situations where the muscular fibres are deficient, as between the External intercostal muscles and sternum, in front; and between the Internal intercostals and spme, ^''^"Tho Intercostal Muscles (fig. 17°) are two thin planes of muscular and tendinous structure, placed one over the other, filling up the intercostal spaces, and being directed obliquely between the margins of the adjacent ribs. Ihey have received the name ' external' and ' internal,' from the position they bear to one another. The External Intercostals are eleven in number on each side, bemg attached to the adiacent margins of each pair of ribs, and extending from the tubercles of the ribs behind, to the commencement of the cartilages of the ribs, m Iront, where they terminate in a thin membranous aponeurosis, which is continued for- wards to the sternum. They arise from the outer Hp of the groove on the lower border of each rib, and are inserted into the upper border of the rib below. In the two lowest spaces they extend to the end of the ribs. Their fibres are directed obUquely downwards and forwards, in a similar direction with those ot the External oblique muscle. They are thicker than the Internal mtercostals.

The Internal Intercostals, also eleven in number on each side, are placed on the inner sui^face of the preceding, commencing anteriorly at the sternum, m the ntersDaces between the cartilages of the true ribs, and from the anterior exte- rn tTes'of the ^ti^^^ of the false ribs; and extend backwards as far as he rnlles of the ribs, where they are continued to the vertebral column by a thin aponeurosis. They arise from the inner lip of the groove on the lower border of each rib as well as from the corresponding costal cartilage, and are inserted into thfupper bolder of the rib below. Their fibres are directed obhquely downwards and backwards, decussating with the fibres of the preceding Bemons.

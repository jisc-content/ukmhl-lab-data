Bach ri.g receives, by its ventricuW margin, the attachment of the muscular fibres of the ventricles; ^taopposite margin presents three deep semicircular notches, withan which the middle coat of the artery (which presents three convex semicircular segments) is firmly fixed; the attachment of the artery to its fibrous ring being strengthened by the thm cellular coat and nerous membrane externally, and by the endocardium withm it is opposite the margins of these semicircular notches, in the arterial rings, that the endocardium, by its reduplication, forms the semilunar valves, the fibrous structure of-the ring being continued into each of the segments of the valve at this part The middle coat, of the artery in this situation is thm, and the sides of the yessel dilated to form the sinuses of Valsalva. The muscular structure of the heart consists, of bands of fibres, which present an exceedingly intricate interlacement. They are of a deep red colour, and marked with transverse striae. The musculdr fibres of the heart admit of a subdivision into two kinds : those of the auricles, and those of the ventricles : which are quite independent of one another. Fibres of the auricles. These are disposed in two layers :- a superficial layer common to both cavities, and a deep layer proper to each* The superficial fibres are more distinct on the anterior surface of the auricks^ across the bases of which they run in a transverse direction, forming a thinj but incomplete, layer. Some of these fibres pass into the septum auricularum. The internal or dsep fibres proper to each auricle consist of two sets, looped,, and annular fibres. The looped fibres pass upwards over each auricle; being attached by two extremities to> the corresponding auriculo-vehtricular rings, in front and behind. The annular fibres surround the whole extent of the appendices auriculae, and are continued upon the walls of the venae cavae and coronary sinus on the right side, and upon the pulmonary veins on the left side; at their connection with the heart. In the appendices, they interlace with the longitudinal fibres. The fibres of the ventricles are arranged in numerous layers,, of which Petti- grew,* the most recent and the best authority, describes seven. Other anatomists have regarded them differently, and indeed there must be some uncertainty on the subject, for the layers are not independent of each other, but their fibres are interlaced to a considerable extent. And it has been observed that as Petti- grew's observations were made chiefiy on the hearts of th« lower animals, they may not apply exactly to man. Yet as this description lias been received by the best anatomists, and is supported by a large series, of preparations, it seems .best to adopt it. The general result of these investigations may bo very briefly stated as follows. In the left ventricle the fibres of the first or most external layer are continuous with those of the seventh or most internal, those of the second with the sixth, and ♦ Phil. Trans. 1864.

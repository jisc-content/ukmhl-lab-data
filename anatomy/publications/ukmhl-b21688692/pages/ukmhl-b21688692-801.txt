FaaTAL ClKCULATION. The arterial blood destined for the nutrition of the ftetus, ^^^^^^ Dlacenta to the f(Btus, along the umbilical cord, by the umbihcal vem. ihe Sucal vein enters the abdomen at the umbilicus, and P--%-P--'l^;i^7,^^^; fi^e margin of the suspensory ligament of ^1-Kver to the under surf^^^^^^^^ organ, where it gives off two or three branches to the e t obe, one of whxch^s of laiie size; and others to the lobus quadratus and lobulus Spigeln._ At the transverse fissure it divides into two branches ; of these, the larger joined by the portal vein, and enters the right lobe: the smaller branch continues onwards under the name of the ductus venosus, and joins the left hepatic vein at the point of iunction of that vessel with the inferior vena cava. The blood, therefore which, traverses the umbilical vein, reaches the inferior cava in three different ways. The greater quantity circulates through the liver with the portal venous blood, before entering the vena cava by the hepatic veins: some enters the hver directly, and is also'returned to the inferior cava by the hepatic veins ; the smaller quantity passes directly into the vena cava, by the junction of the ductus venosus with the left hepatic vein. In the inferior cava, the blood carried by the ductus venosus and hepatic veans, becomes mixed with that returning from the lower extremities and viscera of the abdomen. It enters the right auricle, and, guided by the Eustachian valve, passes through the foramen ovale into the left auricle, where it becomes mixed with a small quantity of blood returned from the lungs by the pulmonary veins. From the left auricle it passes into the left ventricle; and, from the left ventricle, into the aorta, from whence it is distributed almost entirely to the head and upper extremities, a small quantity being probably carried into the descending aorta. From the head and upper extremities, the blood is returned by the branches of the superior vena cava to the right auricle, where it becomes mixed with a small portion of the blood from the inferior cava. From the right auricle it descends over the Eustachian valve into the right ventricle ; and, from the right ventricle, passes into the pulmonary artery. .The lungs of the foetus being solid, and almost impervious, only a small quantity of the blood of the pulmonary artery is distri- buted to them, by the right and left pulmonary arteries, which is returned by the pulmonary veins to the left auricle : the greater part passes through the ductus arteriosus into the commencement of the descending aorta, where it becomes mixed with a small quantity of blood transmitted by the left ventricle into the aorta. Along this vessel it descends to supply the lower extremities and viscera of the abdomen and pelvis, the chief portion being, however, conveyed by the umbilical arteries to the placenta. From the preceding account of the circulation of the blood in the foetus, it will be seen :— 1. That the placenta serves the double purpose of a respiratory and nutritive organ, receiving the venous blood from the foetus, and returning it again reoxy- genated, and charged with additional nutritive material. 2. That nearly the whole of the blood of the umbilical vein traverses the liver before entering the inferior cava ; hence the large size of this organ, especially at an early period of footal life. 3. That the right auricle is the point of meeting of a double current, the blood in the inferior cava being guided by the Eustachian valve into the left auricle, whilst that in the superior cava descends into the right ventricle. At an early period of foetal life, it is highly probable that the two streams are quite distinct; for the inferior cava opens almost directly into the left auricle, and the Eusta- chian valve would exclude the current aloug the vein from entering the right

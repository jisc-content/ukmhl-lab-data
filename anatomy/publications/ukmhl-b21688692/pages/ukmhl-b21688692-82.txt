Ixxviii GENERAL ANATOMY. The investing capsules are from thirty to sixty in number, the outer being more separated from each other, as if by a clear fluid, while the inner are closely applied together. Schultze calls attention to the striking re- semblance in all essential particulars between these corpuscles andKrause's end-bulbs above described.* Fig. XXXI.—A, Side -piew of a papilla of the hand, a, cortical layer; h, tactile cor- puscle, with transverse nuclei; c, small nerve of the papilla, with neurilemma d, its two nervous fibres running with spiral coils around the tactile corpuscles ; e, ap- parent termination of one of these fibres. B, A tactile papilla seen from above, so as to show its transverse section, a, cortical layer ; h, nerve-fibre; c outer layer of the tactile body, with nuclei; d, clear interior substance.

Fig. XXXII.—Pacinian coi-puscle with its system of capsules and central cavity, a, ai-terial twig, ending in capillaries, which form loops in some of the intercapsular spaces, and one penetrates to the central capsule ; b, the fibrous tissue of the stallc pro- longed from the neurilemma; n, nerve-tube advancing to the central capsule, there losing its white sub- stance, and stretching along the axis to the opposite end, where it is fixed by a tubercular enlargement.

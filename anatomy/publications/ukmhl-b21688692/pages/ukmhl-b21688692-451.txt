The tendon of this muscle contains a sesamoid bone, near its insertion, and gives off hbrous expansions, one of which passes backwards to tho os calcis, others outwards to the middle and external cuneiform, and some forwards to the bases of the third and fourth metatarsal bones ^^%daL>^.

The Popliteus is supplied by the internal popUteal nerve, the remaining muscles of this group by the posterior tibial nerve. Actions. The Popliteus assists in flexing the leg upon the thigh; when the leg is flexed, it will rotate the tibia inwards. The Tibialis posticus is a direct extensor of the tarsus upon the leg ; acting in conjunction with the Tibialis anticus, it turns the sole of the foot inwards, antagonising the Peroneus longus, which turns it outwards. The Flexor fongus digitorum and Flexor longus pollicis are the dii-ect Flexors of the phalanges, and, continuing their action, extend the foot upon the leg; they assist the Gastrocnemius and Soleus in extending the foot, as in the act of walking, or in standing on tiptoe. In consequence of the oblique • direction of the tendon of the long extensor, the toes would be drawn inwards, were it not for the Flexor accessorius muscle, which is inserted into the outer side of that tendon, and draws it to the middle line of the foot during its action. Taking their fixed point from the foot, these muscles serve to maintain the upright posture, by steadying the tibia and fibula, perpendicularly, upon the ankle-joint. They also serve to raise these bones from the oblique position they assume in the stooping posture. Fibular Region. Peroneus Longus. Peroneus Brevis. Dissection. These muscles are readily exposed, by removing' the fascia coverino- their surface, from below upwards, in the line of direction of their fibres. ° The Peroneus Longus is situated at the upper part of the outer side of the leg, and is the more superficial of the two muscles. It arises from the head, and upper two-thirds of the outer surface of the shaft of the fibula, from the deep surface of the fascia, and from the intermuscular septa,-between it and the muscles on the front, and those on the back of the leg. It terminates in a long tendon, which passes behind the outer malleolus, in a groove, common to it and the Peroneus brevis, the groove being converted into a canal by a fibrous band, and the tendons in- vested by a common synovial membrane ; it is then reflected, obHquely forwards across the outer side of the os calcis, being contained in a separate fibrous sheath' hned by a prolongation of the synovial membrane from that which lines the groove behind the malleolus. Having reached the outer side of the cuboid bone, it runs m a groove on the under surface of that bone, which is converted into a canal by the long calcaneo-cuboid ligament, and is lined by a synovial membrane- the tendon then crosses obliquely the sole of the foot, and is inserted into the outer side of the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The tendon changes Its direction at two points: first, behind the external malleolus-, secondly, on l^e outer side of the cuboid bone: in both of these situations, the tendon subStnce ' " ' " ' ' '"'^"^''^ "^-^"^ d-^^-^l-P^d - Relations.

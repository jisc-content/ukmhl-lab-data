The pencramal branchy aie distributed to the pericranium over the frontal and parietal bones. iHey are derived from the cutaneous branches whilst beneath the muscle. t,„„^„i The Nasal ne^^e is intermediate in size between the frontal and lachrymal, and more deeply placed than the other branches of the ophthalmic It enters tue orbit between the two heads of the External rectus, and passes obliquely mwaras across the optic nerve, beneath the Levator palpebriB and Superior rectus muscles, to the inner wall of the orbit, where it enters the anterior ethmoidal loramen, immediately below the Superior oblique. It then enters the cavity of the cranium traverses a shallow groove on the front of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and passes down, through the slit by the side of the crista galh, into the nose, where it divides into two branches, an internal and an external. iHe internal Irancli supplies the mucoas membrane near the fore part of the septuna of the nose. The external hranch descends in a groove on the inner surface ot the nasal bone, and supphes a few filaments to the mucous membrane covering the fore part of the outer wall of the nares as far as the inferior spongy bone ; it then leaves the cavity of the nose, between the lower border of the nasal bone and the upper lateral cartilage of the nose, and, passing down beneath the Com- pressor nasi, supplies the integument of the ala and the tip of the nose, joining with the facial nerve. The branches of the nasal nerve are, the ganglionic, ciliary, and infratrochlear. The ganglionic is a long, slender branch, about half an inch in length, which usually arises from the nasal, between the two heads of the external rectus. It passes forwards on the outer side of the optic nerve, and enters the superior and posterior angle of the ciliary ganglion, forming its superior, or long root. It is sometimes joined by a filament from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic, or from the superior division of the third nerve. The long ciliary nerves, two or three in number, are given off from the nasal as it crosses the' optic nerve. They join the short ciliary nerves from the ciliary gan- glion, pierce the posterior part of the sclerotic, and, running forwards between it and the choroid, are distributed to the ciliary muscle and iris. The infratrochlear hranch is given off just as the nasal nerve passes through the anterior ethmoidal foramen. It runs forwards along the upper border of the Internal rectus, and is joined, beneath the pulley of the Superior oblique, by a filament from the supratrochlear nerve. It then passes to the inner angle of the eye, and supplies the Orbicularis palpebrarum, the integument of the eyelids, and side of the nose, the conjunctiva, lachryrhal sac, and caruncula lachrymalis. Ophthalmic Gangliok. (Fig. 273.) Connected with the three divisions of the fifth nerve are four small ganglia, which form the whole of the cephalic portion of the sympathetic. "With the first division is connected the ophthalmic ganglion ; with the second division, the spheno-palatine, or Meckel's ganglion; and with the third, the otic and sub- maxillary ganglia. All the four receive sensitive filaments from the fifth, and motor and sympathetic filaments from various sources ; these filaments are called the roots of the ganglia. The ganglia are also connected with each other, and with the cervical portion of the sympathetic.

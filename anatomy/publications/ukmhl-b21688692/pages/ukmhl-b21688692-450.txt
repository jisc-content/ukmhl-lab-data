314 MUSCLES AND FASUi/K The Flexor Juongus PolUcis is situated on the fibular side of the leg, and is the most superficial and largest of the three next muscles. It arises from the lower two-thirds of the iutornal surface of the shaft of the fibula, with the exception of an inch at its lowest part; from the lower part of the interosseous membrane ; from an intermuscular septum between it and the Peronei, externally; and from the fascia coverin"- the Tibialis posticus. The fibres pass obliquely downwards and backwards and terminate round a tendon which occupies nearly the whole length of the posterior surface of the muscle. This tendon passes through a groove on the posterior surface of the tibia, external to that for the Tibialis posticus and Flexor lono-us digitorum.; it then passes through another groove on the posterior , extremity of the astralagus, and along a third groove, beneath the lesser process of the OS calcis, into the sole of the foot, where it runs forwards between the two heads of the Flexo'r brevis pollicis, and is inserted into the base of the last x^halanx of the 'o-reat toe. The grooves in the astralagus and os calcis which contain the tendon of the muscle, are converted by tendinous fibres into distinct canals, lined by synovial membrane'; and as the tendon crosses the sole of the foot, it is connected to the common flexor by a tendinous slip. Belations. By its s'liperficial surface, with the Soleus and Tendo Achilhs, from which it is separated by the deep fascia. By its deep surface with the fibula, Tibialis posticus, the peroneal vessels, the lower part of the interosseous mem- hrane, and the ankle-joint. By its outer border, with the Peronei. By its inner border, with the Tibiahs posticus, and Flexor longus digitorum. The Flexor Longus Digitorum (perforans) is situated on the tibial side of the leo- At its origin, it is thin and pointed, but gradually increases in size as it descends It arises from the posterior surface of the shaft of the tibia imme- diately below the oblique line, to within three inches of its extremity, mternal to the tibial origin of the Tibialis posticus; some fibres also aiise from the inter- muscular septum between it and the Tibialis posticus. The fibres termmate m a tendon, which runs nearly the whole length of the posterior surface of the muse e. This tendon passes, behind the malleolus, in a groove, common to it and the Tibialis posticus, but separated from the latter by a fibrous septum; each tendon bein- contained in a special sheath lined by a separate synovial membrane It then passes obliquely forwards and outwards, beneath the arch of the os calcis, into the sole of the foot (fig. 195), where, crossing beneath the tendon of the Flexor longus pollicis, to which it is connected by a strong tendmous_ slip it becomes expanded, is joined by the Flexor accessorius, and finally divides into four tendons, which are inserted into the bases of the last phalanges of the four lesser toes each tendon passing through a fissure in the tendon of the Flexor brevis digitorum, opposite the middle of the first phalanges. Belations. In the leg: by its superficial surface, with the Soleus, and the posterior tibial vessels and nerve, from which it is separated by the deep fascia; by its deep surface, with the tibia and TibiaUs posticus. In the foot, it is covered by the Abductor Pollicis, and Flexor brevis digitorum, and crosses beneath the Flexor longus pollicis. j â–  ^.^ j- The Tildalis Posticus lies between the two preceding muscles, and is the most deeply seated of all the muscles in the leg. It commences above by two pointed p cesses, separated by an angular interval, though which ^^^^^^^ ^f^^ vessels pass forwards to the front of the leg. It arises from the whole of the postex'or surface of the interosseous membrane, excepting its lowest part from L postetlr surface of the shaft of the tibia, external to the Flexor longus digitorum, between the. commencement of the oblique line above, and the middle oi^ he external border of the bone below, and fi-om the upper two-thirds of the ler sulce of the shaft of the fibula; some fibres also arise from the deep fascia, Td 10" th intermuscular septa, separating it from the adjacent muscles 011 e^h Xde This muscle, in the lower fourth of the leg. passes in front of the h le.ac Wus digitorum, terminates in a tendon, which passes through a guoove behind IreTnne malleolus, with the tendon of that muscle, but enclosed m a separate

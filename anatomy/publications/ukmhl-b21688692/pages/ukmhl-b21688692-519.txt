BRANCHES OF ULNAR. 383 221.-Arteries of tlie Back of the Forearm and Hand. Ajiaa to moliffi thia process and tl,e olecranon, it lies beneath the Flexor carpi nlnaris ascending t:Z:Z Lads of that n^nscle, beneath the ulnar and anastomoses with, the inferior profunda, anasto- motica magna, and inter- osseous recari-ent arteries (fig- 221). The interosseous artery (fig. 220) is a short trunk, about an inch in length, and of considerable size, which arises immediately below the tuberosity of the radius, and, passing back- wards to the upper border of the interosseous mem- brane, divides into two branches, the anterior and posterior interosseous. The anterior interosseous passes down the forearm on tbe anterior surface of the interosseous mem- brane, to whicb it is con- nected by a thin aponeur- otic arch. It is accom- panied by the interosseous branch of the median nerve, and overlapped by tbe con- tiguous margins of the Flexor profundus digito- rum and Flexor longus pollicis muscles, giving off in this situation muscular branches, and the nutrient arteries of the radius and Voaterwr Cnrpt ( Vlnar^ I 7ernii titttton of \A. n terioi'lnlerosffeo tt s FostP.r/or Cai'UctZ (JiaJinJ ) orxni/.v Ptilliei.

At the upper border of the Pronator quadratus, a branch descends in front of that muscle, to anasto- mose in front of the carpus with branches from the anterior carpal and deep palmar arch. The continu- ation of the artery passes behind the Pronator quad- ratus (fig. 221), and, piei'c- ing the interosseous mem- brane, descends to the back of the wrist, where it an- astomoses with the poste- rior interosseous and the posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar arteries. The anterior interosseous gives off a long, slender branch, which accompanies the median nerve, and gives offsets to its substance. This, the median artery, is some- times much enlarged. Thejposfenor interosseous artery passes backwards through the interval between

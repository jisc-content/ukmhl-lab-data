The venae comites should be carefully separated from the vessel, and the ligature passed from the radial to the ulnar side. In the middle third of the forearm the artery may be ex- posed by making an incision of similai* length on the inner mar- gin of the Supinator longus. In this situation, the radial nerve lies in close relation with the outer side of the artery, and should, as well as the veins, bo carefully avoided. In the lower third, the artery is easily secured by dividing the integument and I'ascias in the interval between the tendons of the Supinator longus and Flexor carpi radialis muscles. The branches of the radial artery may be divided into three groups, corresponding with the three regions in which the vessel is situated. {Radial recurrent. Muscular. Superficialis volas. Anterior carpal. {Posterior carpal. Metacarpal. Dorsales poUicis. Dorsalis indicia, r Princeps pollicis. J Radialis iudicis. I Perforating. Interosseous. The Surgical Anatomy of the Radial and ^' "ulnar Arteries. Wrist. Hand. The radial recurrent is giyen off immediately below the elbovs^. It ascends between the branches of the musculo- spiral nerve, lying on the Supinator brevis, and then between the Supinator longus and Brachialis anticus, sup- plying these muscles and the elbow-joint, and anastomosing with the terminal branches of the superior profunda. The muscular branches are distributed to the muscles on the radial side of the forearm. The superficialis voice arises from the radial artery, just where this vessel is about to wind round the wrist.

89 SCAPULA. supra- from the infraspinous fossa: it commences at the vertebral border by a smooth triangular surface, over which the Trapezius glides, separated from the bone by a bursa : and, gradually becoming more elevated as it passes forwards, terminates in the acromion process which overhangs the shoulder-joint. The spine is triangular, and flattened from above downwards, its apex corresponding to the posterior border; its base, which is directed outwards, to the neck of the scapula. It presents two surfaces and three borders. Its superior surface is concave, assists in forming the supraspinous fossa, and affords attachment to part of the Supraspinatus muscle. Its inferior surface forms part of the infraspinous fossa, gives origin to part of the Infraspinatus muscle, and presents near its centre the orifice of a nutrient canal. Of the three borders, the anterior is attached to the dorsum of the bone; the posterior, or crest of the spine, is broad, and presents two lips, and an intervening rough interval. To the superior lip is attached the Trapezius, to the extent shown in the figure. A very rough tubercle is generally seen occupying that portion of the spine which receives the insertion of the middle and inferior fibres of this muscle. To the inferior lip, throughout its whole length, is attached the Deltoid. The interval between the lips is also partly covered by the fibres of these muscles. The external border, the shortest of the three, is slightly concave, its edges thick and round, continuous above with the under surface of the acromion process ; below, with the neck of the scapula. The narrow portion of bone external to this border serves to connect the supra- and infraspinous fossse. The Acromion process, so called from forming the summit of the shoulder (iiKpor, a summit; wfioc, the shoulder), is a large and somewhat triangular process, flattened from behind forwards, directed at first a little outwards, and then curving forwards and upwards, so as to overhang the glenoid cavity. Its upjier surface, directed upwards, backwards, and outwards, is convex, rough, and gives attachment 'to some fibres of the Deltoid. Its under surface is smooth and concave. Its outer harder, which is thick and irregular, affords attachment to the Deltoid muscle. Its inner margin, shorter than the outer, is concave, gives attachment to a portion of the Trapezius muscle, and presents about its centre a small oval surface, for articulation with the acromial end of the clavicle. Its apex, which corresponds to the point of meeting of these two borders in front, is thin, and has attached to it the coraco.acromial ligament. _ Of the three borders or costaa of the scapula, the superior is the shortest and thinnest; it is concave, terminating at its inner extremity at the superior ano-le at Its outer extremity at the coracoid process. At its outer part is a deep semicircular notch, the suprascapular, formed partly by the base of the coracoid process This notch is converted into a foramen by the transverse ligament, and serves for the passage of the suprascapular nerve. The adjacent margin of the superior border affords attachment to the Omo-hyoid muscle. The external, or a^Mary, border is the thickest of the three. It commences above at the lower margin ot the g enoid cavity, and inchnes obliquely downwards and backwards to the inferior augle. Immediately below the glenoid cavity, is a rough impression about an mch m length, which affords attachment to the iong head of the Triceps ZrtV," J^V^^^^^.^^^^ longitudinal groove, which extends as far as its owe third, and affords ongm o part of the Subscapularis muscle.

DiAPimAGMATic Region. Diaphragm. The Biaplmifjw (^.lafimy^m, a jJartUum wall) (ing. 167) is a thin musculo-fibrous septum, placed obliquely at tho junction of the upper with tlie middle third of the trunk and separating tho thorax fi'om tho abdomen, foi-ming tho floor of the former cavity and the roof of tho latter. It is elliptical, its longest diameter being from side to side, somewhat fo,n-shapcd, the broad elliptical portion being horizontal, the narrow part, which represents the handle of the fan, vertical, and joined at right 167.—The Diapliragni.

It is from this circumstance that some anatomists describe it as consisting of two portions, the upper or great muscle of the Diaphragm, and the lower or lesser muscle. It arises from the whole of the internal circumference of the thorax, being attached, in front, by fleshy fibres to the ensiform carti age; on either side, to the inner surface of the cartilages and bony portions of the six or seven inferior ribs, interdigitating with the Transversalis; and behind, to two aponeurotic arches, named the ligamentum arcuatum externum and internum, and to the lumbar vertebm. The (ibres from these sources vary in length ; t^K^se aris- ing from the ensiform appendix are very short and occasionally aponeurotic ; tliose from the ligamenta arei'^.a, and more espoeially those from the ribs aU - -de^of the chest are longer, .le.scribe well-marked curves as they ascend, and fina 1) co" terge to be inserted into the circumference of the central tendon.

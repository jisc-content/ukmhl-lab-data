43 THE SKELETON. 41.—Skull at Birth, showing the Anterior and Posterior Fontaaelles. iu two syniniotrical segments, one on either side of the median line; these subsequently coalesce, so as to enclose tlie chorda dorsalis—the chief part of the cerebral capsule still retaininf its membranous form. Ossilicution first takes placie in the roof, and is preceded bv the deposition of a membranous blastema upon the surface of the cerebral capsule, in which the ossifying process extends; the primitive membranous capsule becoming the internal periosteum, and being ultimately blended with the dura mater. Although the bones of the vertex of the skull appear before tbose at the base, and make con- siderable progress in their growth: at birth ossification is more advanced in the base, this portion of the skull forming a solid immov- able groundwork. The B'ontanellbs (figs. 41, 42). Before birth, the bones at the vertex and side of the skull are separated from each other by membranous intervals, in which bone is deficient. These intervals, at certain parts, are of considerable size, and are termed the fon- tanellen, so called from the pulsations of the brain, which are perceptible at the anterior fontanelle, and were likened to the rising of water in a fountain. The fontanelles are four iu number, and correspond to the junction of the four angles of the parietal with the con- tiguous bones. The anterior fontanelle is th'e largest, and corresponds to the junction of the sagittal and coronal sutures; the pos- terior fontanelle, of smaller size, is situated at the junction of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures ; the two remaining ones are situated at the inferior angles of the parietal bone. The latter are closed soon after birth; the two at the superior angles remain open longer: the posterior being closed in a few months after birth; the anterior remaining open imtil tbe first or second year. These spaces are gradually filled in by an extension of the ossifying process, or by the development ot a Wormian bone. Sometimes the anterior fontanelle remains open beyond two years, and is occasionally persistent throughout lite. 42.—The Lateral Fontanelles. SUPBRJSDMERARY OE WoRMU^^ * BONES.

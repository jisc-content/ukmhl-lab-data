Conjoined feyie/on. CRCMASTfR Sometimes this tendon is insufficient to resist the pressure from within, and is car- ried forward in front of the protrusion through the external ring, forming one of the coverings of direct inguinal hernia. The aponeurosis of the Internal obhque is continued forward to the middle line of the abdomen, where it joins with the aponeurosis of the opposite muscle at tlic linea alba, and extends from the margin of the thorax to the pubes. At the outer margin of the Rectus muscles, this aponeurosis, for the upper three-fourths of its extent, divides into two lamcllre, which pass, one in front and tlie other behind the muscle, enclosing it in a kind of sheath, and reuniting on its inner

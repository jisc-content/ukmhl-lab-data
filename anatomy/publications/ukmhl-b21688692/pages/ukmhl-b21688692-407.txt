Tho Biceps is a long fusiform muscle, occupying the whole of the anterior surface of the arm, and divided above into two portions or heads, from whicli circumstance it has received its name. Tho short head arises by a thick flattened tendon from the apex of the coracoid process, in common with the Coracoid- brachialis. The long head arises from the upper margin of the glenoid cavity, by a long rounded tendon, which is continuous with tho glenoid ligament. This tendon arches over tho head of the humerus, being enclosed in a special sheath of the synovial membrane of the shoulder-joint; it then pierces the capsular ligament at its attachment to the humerus, and descends in the bicipital groove, in which it is retained by a fibrous prolongation from the tendon of tlie Pectoralis major. The fibres from this tendon form a rounded belly, and, about the middle of the arm, join with the portion of the muscle derived from the short head. The belly of the muscle, narrow and somewhat flattened, terminates above the elbow in a flattened tendon, which is inserted into the back part of the tuberosity of the radius, a synovial bursa being interposed between the tendon.and the front of the tuberosity. The tendon of the muscle is thin and broad; as it approaches the radius it becomes narrow and twisted upon itself, being applied by a flat surface to the back part of the tuberosity: opposite the bend of the elbow the tendon gives off, from its inner side, a broad aponeurosis, the bicipital fascia, which passes obliquely downwards and inwards across the brachial artery, and is continuous with the fascia of the forearm (fig. 169). The inner border of this muscle forms a guide to the position of the vessel, in tying the brachial artery in the middle of the arm.* Belations. Its anterior surface is overlapped above by the Pectoralis major and Deltoid ; in the rest of its extent it is covered by the superficial and deep fasciiB and the integument. Its posterior stirface rests on the shoulder-joint and humerus, from which it is separated by the Subscapularis, Teres Major, Latissimus dorsi' BrachiaUs anticus, and the musculo-cutaneous nerve. Its mner border is in relation with the Coraco-brachialis, the brachial vessels, and median nerve; its Older border, with the Deltoid and Supinator longus. The BrachiaUs Anticus is a broad muscle, which covers the elbow-joint and the lower half of the front of the humerus. It is somewhat compressed from before backward, and is broader in the middle than at either extremity. It arises from the lower half of the outer and inner surfaces of the shaft of the humerus • and commences above at the insertion of the Deltoid, which it embraces by two angular processes Its origin extends below, to within an inch of the margin of the arti- cular sm-face and is limited on each side by the external and internal borders of the shaft of the humerus. It also arises from the intermuscular septa on each side but more extensively from the inner than the outer. Its fibres converge to a thick tendon, which is inserted into a rough depression on the anterior surface of the coronoid process of the ulna, being received into an interval between two fleshy slips of the Flexor digitorum profundus.

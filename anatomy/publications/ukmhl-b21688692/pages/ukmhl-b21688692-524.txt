Aneurisms of the abdominal aorta near the cceliac axis communicate in neaiiy equal proportion with the anterior and posterior parts of the artery. Wben an aneurismal sac is connected with the back part of the abdominal aorta, it usually produces absorption of the bodies of the vertebrae, and forms a pulsating tumour, that presents itself in the left hypochondriac or epigastric _ regions accompanied by symptoms of disturbance of the alimentary canal. Pain is invariably present, and is usually of two kinds, a fixed and constant pain in the back, caused by the tumour pressing on or displacing the branches of the solar plexus and splanchnic nerves and a sharp lancinating pain, radiating along those branches of the lumbar nerves which are preyed on by the tumour ; henfe the°pain in the loins, the testes, the bypogastrium, and m the lower hmb rusuaUy of the left side). This form of aneurism usuaUy bursts into the peritoneal cavity or behind the peritoneum, in the left hypochondriac region ; or it may form a large aneSsmal sac, extending down as low as Poupart-s ligament; hemorrhage m these ca^es bein<^ generally very extensive, but slowly produced, and not rapidly latal. mr an anemlsmal sac is connected with the front of the aorta near the ccelia^ ax^ it forms a pulsating tumour in the left hypochondriac or epigastric regions, usually attended withTymptoms of" disturbance of the alimentary canal, as sickness, dyspepsia, or consti- Stiom^rd accompanied by pain, which is constant but near y always W m the loi^, Sstrium, or some part of the abdomen; the radiating pain being rare, as the lumba neifes are'seldom implicated. This form of aneurism may burst into the peritoneal cavity or behind the peritoneum, between the layers of the mesentery, or, more rarely, into the duodenum ; it rarely extends backwards so as to affect the spine „„^„„.p The abdom nal aortl has been tied seveml times, and although none of.Jhe paUenta permaneX recovered, still, as one of them lived ,ia long as ten days, the possibility of the ?e eTblishment of the circulation may be considered to be proved. In the lower arumds Ibis artery is often successfully tied. The vessel may be reached m several ways. Li the ■ -n.! nT^Pration performed by Sir A.Cooper, an incision was made m the Imea alba, Sei tonCm o%S^^^^^^^ finger caJried down amongst the intestines tow^s the snine the peritoneum again opened behind, by scratching through the mesentery, and he vessel thus Wed. Or°either of the operations, described below, for securing the common S artery may by extending the dissection a sullicient distance upwards, be made ?f ?o eSe the aorta. The'clief difficulty in the dead sub ect consists m isolating the ^L?v Tconsequence of its great depth; but in the living subject, t^e embarrassment Wtinl from Srproximity of the aneurismal tumour, and the great probabi ity of disea^ I^tte vLtTLei^ the dangers and difficulties of this formidable operation so greaUy, nttiSeJrit^^^^^^^^ nss the inferior mesenteric and the internal pudic, when ('-y^'^lf'^^^TLlsUymoses of li<^ature is below the origin of the inferior inesenter c ; and possibly oy me ana^w the lumbar arteries with the branches of the internal iliac. ^prson" by

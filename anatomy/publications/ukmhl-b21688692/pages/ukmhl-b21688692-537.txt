It extends to the side of the bladder, distributing numerous branches to the body and fundus of the organ. From one of these a slender vessel is derived, which accompanies the vas deferens in its course to the testis, where it anastomoses with the spermatic artery. This is the artery of the vas deferens. Other branches supply the ureter. The middle vesical, usually a branch of the superior, is distributed to the base of the bladder, and under surface of the vesiculse seminales. The inferior vesical arises from the anterior division of the internal iliac, in common with the middle hsemorrhoidal, and is distributed to the base of the bladder, the prostate gland, and vesiculse seminales. The branches distributed to the prostate communicate with the corresponding vessel of the opposite side. The middle hcemorrhoidal artery usually arises together with the preceding vessel. It suppHes the rectum, anastomosing with the other hcemorrhoidal arteries. The uterine artery passes downwards from the anterior trunk of the internal iliac to the neck of the uterus. Ascending, in a tortuous course, on the side of this viscus, between the layers of the broad ligament, it distributes branches to its substance, anastomosing, near its termination, with a branch from the ovarian artery. Branches from this vessel are also distributed to the bladder and ureter. The vaginal artery is analogous to the inferior vesical in the male ; it descends upon the vagina, supplying its mucous membrane, and sending branches to the neck of the bladder and contiguous part of the rectum. The Obturator Artbrt usually arises from the anterior trunk of the internal iliac, frequently from the posterior. It passes forwards below the brim of the pelvis, to the canal in the upper border of the obturator foramen, and escaping from the pelvic cavity through this aperture, divides into an internal and an external branch. In the pelvic cavity this vessel lies upon the pelvic fascia, beneath the peritoneum, and a little below the obturator nerve ; and whilst passing through the obturator foramen, is contained in an oblique canal, formed by the horizontal branch of the pubes, above; and the arched border of the obturator membrane, below. * Medico- Chinirgical Trans., vol. xvi.

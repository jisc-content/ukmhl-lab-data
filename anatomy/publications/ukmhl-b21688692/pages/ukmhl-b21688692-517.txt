Ulnae Artekt. The Ulnar Arterij, the larger of the two subdivisions of the brachial, commences a little below the ioend of the elbow, and crosses the inner side of the forearm obliquely inwards, to the commencement of its lower half; it then runs along its ulnar border to the wrist, crosses the annular ligament on the radial side of the pisiform bone, and passes across the palm of the hand, forming the superficial palmar arch, which sometimes terminates by inosculating with the superficialis ^°^^B6latio7is in the Forearm. In its upper half, it is deeply seated, being covered by all the superficial Flexor muscles, excepting the Flexor carpi ulnaris ; it is crossed by the median nerve, which lies to its inner side for about an inch, and it lies upon the Brachialis anticus and Flexor profundus digitorum muscles. In the loioer half of the forearm, it Hes upon the Flexor profundus, being covered by the integument, the superficial and deep fasciae, and is placed between the Flexor carpi ulnaris and Flexor sublimis digitorum muscles. It is accompanied by two vense comites ; the ulnar nerve lies on its inner side for the lower two-thirds of its extent, and a small branch from the nerve descends on the lower part of the vessel to the palm of the hand.

At the wrist (fig. 219), the ulnar artery is covered by the integument and fascia, and lies upon the anterior annular ligament. On its inner side is the pisiform bone. The ulnar nerve lies at the inner side, and somewhat behind the artery. Li the 2jalm of the hand, the continuation of the ulnar artery is called the superficial palmar arch ; it passes obliquely outwards to tho interspace between

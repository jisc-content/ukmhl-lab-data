Ixxxvi GENERAL ANATOMY. veins do not stand open when divided, as the arteries do; and that they are passive rather than active organs of the circulation. In the veins immediately above the capillaries, the three coats are hardly to be distinguished. The epithelium is supported on an outer membrane of nucleated connective tissue, separable into two layers, the outer of which is the thicker, the fibres of both being longitudinal. The interior thinner layer of nucleated tissue is regarded by Kolliker as the analogue of the middle coat. In the veins next above these in size (one- fifth of a line, according to Kolliker) a muscular layer and a layer of circular fibres can be traced, forming the middle coat, while the elastic and connective elements of the outer coat become more distinctly per- "^^^ In the middle-sized veins, the typical structure of these vessels becomes clear. The epithelium is of the same character as in the arteries, but its cells are more oval, less fusiform. It is supported by one or more layers of nucleated fibrous tissue, arranged longitudinaUy, and external to this is a layer of elastic fibrous tissue. This constitutes the internal coat. The middle coat is composed of a thick inner layer of connective tissue with elastic fibres, having intermixed in some veins a transverse layer ot muscular fibres; and J^n outer layer consisting of longitudinal elastic lamellse, varying from five to ten in number, alternating with layers ot transverse muscular fibres and connective tissue, v^hich resembles some- what in structure the middle coat of large arteries. The outer coat is similar in all essential respects to that of the arteries. In the large veins, as in the commencement of the vena ports, m the upper part of the abdominal portion of the inferior vena cava, and m the laro-e hepatic trunks within the liver, the middle coat is thick, and its structure similar to that of the middle coat in medium-sized veins; but its muscTilar tissue is scanty, and the longitudinal elastic networks less distinctly lamellated. The muscular tissue of this coat is best marked in the splenic and portal veins; it is absent in certain parts of the vena cava below the liver, and wanting in the subclavian vein and termmal parts of the two cavse. , „ 4.1-1 ^„ In the largest veins, the outer coat is from two to five times thickei than the middle coat, and contains a large number of longitudinal mus- cular fibres. This is most distinct in the hepatic part of the inferior vena cava, and at the termination of this vein in the heart; m the trunks of the hepatic veins; in all the large trunks of the vena ports; m the splenic, superior mesenteric, external iliac, renal, and azygos veins Where the middle coat is absent, this muscular layer extends as far as the inner coat. In the renal and portal veins, it extends through tliej^hole thickness of the outer coat; but in the other vems mentioned, a layer of connective and elastic tissues is found external to the musculai fib es AH the large veins which open into the heart are covered for a shoit distance by a layer of striped muscular tissue contmued on to them from the ^'^Muscular tissue is wanting in theveins-i.

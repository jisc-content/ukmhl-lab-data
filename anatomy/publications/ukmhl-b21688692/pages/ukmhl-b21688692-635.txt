These may bo regarded as com- missural fibres (inter-cerebral) between the thalama .... of opposite Bides. Some fibres are contmued aero s ' the r^terior border of the chiasma, and connect the ^^^^^^ gi^gg^ l^a^ing no relation with the optic tracts. They may be regarded as commissural fibres between the two retini (inter-retinal fibres). The outer fibres of each tract are contmued into the optic nerve of the same side. The central fibres of each tract are continued into the optic nerve of the opposite side, decussating in the commissure^with similar fibres of the opposite tract.* . „ The optio nerves arise from the fore part of the commissure, and, diverging irom one another, become rounded in form and firm in texture, and are enclosed m a sheath derived from the arachnoid. As each nerve passes through the correspond- ino- optic foramen, it receives a sheath from the dura mater; and as it enters the orbit, this sheath subdivides into two layers, one of which becomes continuous with the periosteum of the orbit; the other forms a sheath for the nerve, and sur- rounds it as far as the sclerotic. The nerve passes through the cavity of the orbit, pierces the sclerotic and choroid coats at the back part of the eyeball, a little to the nasal side of its centre, and expands into the retina. A small artery, the arteria centraUs retinae, perforates the optic nerve a little behind the globe, and runs along its interior in a tubular canal of fibrous tissue. _ It supplies the inner surface of the retina, and is accompanied by corresponding veins. AUDITOET NeRYE. The Auditory Nerve (fortio mollis of the seventh paii-) is the special nerve of the sense of hearing, being distributed exclusively to the internal ear. The portio dura of the seventh pair, or facial nerve, is the motor nerve of the muscles of the face. It will be described with the cranial motor nerves. The auditory nerve arises by numerous white stri», the linecB transversce, which emerge from the posterior median fissure in the anterior wall, or floor, of the fourth ventricle. It is also connected with the grey matter of the medulla, corresponding to the locus cseruleus. According to Foville, the roots of this nerve are connected, on the under surface of the middle peduncle, with the grey substance of the cere- bellum, with the flocculus, and with the grey matter at the borders of the calamus scriptorius. The nerve winds round the restiform body, from which it receives fibres, and passes forwards across the posterior border of the crus cerebelli, in company with the facial nerve, from which it is partially separated by a small ai'tery. It then enters the meatus auditorius, in company with the facial nerve, and, at the bottom of the meatus, divides into two branches, cochlear and vesti- bular, which are distributed, the former to the cochlea, the latter to the vestibule and semicircular canals. The auditory nerve is very soft in texture (hence the name, 2^ortio mollis), destitute of neurilemma, and, within the meatus, receives one or two filaments from the facial. The other nerves of special sense must be described with the glosso-pharyngeal and fifth nerves, of which they are parts. • A specimen of congenital nbsence of the optic commissure is to be found iu the Museum of the Westminster Hospital.

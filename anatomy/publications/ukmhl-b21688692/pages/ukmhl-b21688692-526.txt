39° AIITJCIIIKS. Tho 'pylonc hrancli arises from the hepatic, above the pylorus, descends to tho • pyloric end of tho stomach, and passes from right to left along its lesser curvature, , sujjplying it with branches, and inosculating with the gastric artery. The gastro-duodenalis (fig. 224) is a short but large branch, which descends 1 behind tho duodenum, near tho pylorus, and divides at tho lower border of the ■ stomach into two bi-anches, the gastro-epiploica dextra and the pancreatico- duodenalis. Previous to its division, it gives oft" two or three small inferior pyloric branches to the pyloric end of the stomach and pancreas. Tho gasiro-ejnploica dextra runs from right to left along the greater curvature of tho stomach, between the layers of the great omentum, anastomosing about the middle of the lower border of tho stomach with the gastro-epiploica sinistra from the splenic artery. This vessel gives off numerous branches, some of which ascend ' 223.—The Ooeliac Axis and its Branches, the Liver having been raised, and the Lesser Omentum removed. to supply both surfaces of the stomach, whilst others descend to supply the great omentum. The pancreatico-diwdenalis superior descends along the contiguous margins of the duodenum and pancreas. It supplies both these organs, and anastomoses with the inferior pancrcatico-duodenal branch of tho supei'ior mesenteric artery. In ulceration of the duodenum, which frequently occurs in connection with severe burns, this artery may be involved, and death may occur from haamorrhage into the intestinal canal. The cystic artery (fig. 223), usually a branch of tho right hepatic, passes upwards and forwards along tho neck of tho gall bladder, and divides into two branches,

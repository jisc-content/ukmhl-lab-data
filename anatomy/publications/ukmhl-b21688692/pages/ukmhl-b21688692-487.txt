POSTERIOR TRIANGULAR SPACE. 351 body of the jaw, the parotid gland, the nmstoid process; below by the posterior belly of the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid muscles ; m front, by the mjdd^_ hne of the neck. The floor of this space is formed by the anterior belly of the Digastric the Mylo-hyoid, and Hyo-glossus muscles; and it is covered by the integument, superficial fascia, Platysma, and deep fascia ; ramifying between which are branches of the facial and ascending filaments of the superficia cervica nerve. This space contains, in front, the submaxillary gland, imbedded in the substance of which are the facial ai-tery and vein, and their glandular br^anches; beneath this gland on the surface of the Mylo-hyoid muscle, are the submental artery, and the mylo-hyoid artery and nerve. The back part of this space is separated from the front part by the stylo-maxillary ligament; it contains the external carotid artery, ascending deeply in the substance of the parotid gland; this vessel here lies m front of, and superficial to, the internal carotid, being crossed by the facial nerve, and gives off" in its course the posterior auricular, temporal, and internal maxillary branches ; more deeply is the internal carotid, the internal jugular vein, and the pneumo- gastric nerve, separated from the external carotid by the Stylo-glossus and Stylo-pharyngeus muscles, and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve.* PosTERiOK Triangular Space. The posterior triangular space is bounded, in front by the Sterno-mastoid muscle ; behind, by the anterior margin of the Trapezius ; its base corresponds to the upper border of the clavicle ; its apex, to the occiput. The space is crossed about an inch above the clavicle, by the posterior belly of the Omo-hyoid, which divides it unequally into two, an upper or snboccipital, and a lower or subclavian triangle. The Suboccipital, the larger of the two posterior triangles, is bofunded, in front by the Sterno-mastoid ; behind, by the Trapezius ; below, by the Omo-hyoid. Its floor is formed from above downwards by the Splenins, Levator anguli scapulae, and the middle and posterior Scaleni muscles. It is covered by the integument, the Platysma below, the superficial and deep fascijB ; and crossed, above, by the ascending branches of the cervical plexus ; the spinal accessory nerve is directed obliquely across the space from the Sterno-mastoid, which it pierces, to the under surface of the Trapezius; below, the descending branches of the cervical plexus and the transversalis colli artery and vein cross the space. A chain of lymphatic glands is also found running along the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid, from the mastoid process to the root of the neck. The Subclavian, the smaller of the two posterior triangles, is bounded, above, by the posterior belly of the Omo-hyoid ; below, by the clavicle ; its base, directed forwards, being formed by the Sterno-mastoid. The size of this space varies according to the extent of attachment of the clavicular portion of the Sterno- mastoid and Trapezius muscles, and also according to the height at which the Omo-hyoid crosses the neck above the clavicle. The height also of this space varies much, according to the position of the arm, being much diminished by raising the limb, on account of the ascent of the clavicle, and increased by drawing the arm downwards, when that bone is depressed. This space is covered by the integument, superficial and deep fascia: and crossed by the descending branches of the cervical plexus. Just above the level of the clavicle, the third portion of the subclavian artery curves outwards and downwards from the outer margin of the Scalenus anticus, across the first rib to the axilla. Sometimes this vessel nses as high as an inch and a half above the clavicle, or to any point tr\.lJ^^ rZ'JZf' ^'^^ "PP^^. ^^''^^^^ ^'^s made about the inferior carotid i, T'^'Tul-'T^^'"'^ 5" t'^e ^^^^ P'lrt of the space, lie, strictly irvorv hnJXnhn L â€¢ '-^ triangle; but as it on of f "'f relation to the parotid ghuid and Its boundaries of togetrer f'^l^^ncy of surgical operations on tliis gland) nil these parts are spoken

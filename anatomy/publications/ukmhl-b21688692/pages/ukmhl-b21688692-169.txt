Borders of the petrous portion. The superior, the longest, is grooved for the superior petrosal sinus., and has attached to it the tentorium eerebelli ^ at its inner extremity is a semilunar notch, upon which the fifth nerve lies. The posUrwr border is intermediate in length between the superior and the anterior. Its inner half is marked by a groove, which, when completed by its articulation with the occipital, forms the channel for the inferior petrosal sinus. Its outer half presents a deep excavation—the jugular fossa—which, with a similar notch on the occipital, forms the foramen lacerum posterius. A projecting eminence of bono occasionally stands out from the centre of the notch, and divides the foramen into two parts. The anterior border is divided into two parts—an outer joined to the squamous portion by a suture, the remains of which are'distinct; an inner, free, articulating with the spinous process of the sphenoid. At the angle of junction of the petrous and squamous portions are seen two canals, separated from one another by a tbui plate of bone, the processus cochlcariformis : they both lead into the tympunum, the upper one transmitting the Teneor tympani muscle, the lower one the Eustachian tube.

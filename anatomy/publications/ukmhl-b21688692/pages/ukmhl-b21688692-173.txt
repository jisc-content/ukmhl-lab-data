The pterygoid ridge dividing the ^^f^^^ J^^.^^f^f^^^^^^^ portions -ives attachment to part of the External pterygoid muscle At its inner lid :nt;^r extremity is a trilngnlar spine of bone which -™ t^^^^^^ extent of oiigin of this muscle. The md.rior or orbdcd surface, smooth and quad- rdate a° in form, assists in forming the outer wall of the orbit. It is bounded above iy a s;rrated edge, for articulation with the frontal bone ; below, by a roanded border which enters into the formation of the spheno-maxiUary fissure ; internally, it enters into the formation of the sphenoidal fissure ; wliile e.xtenially it presents a serrated margin, for articulation with the malar bone. At the upper part of the inner border is a notcb for the transmission of a bi-anoh of the ophthalmic artery 'and at its lower part a small pointed spine of bone, which serves for tlie attachment of part of the lower head of the External rectus. One or two small foramina may occasionally be seen for the passage of branches of the deep temporal arteries; they are called the external orbital foramina. Circumference of the great wiiig (fig.34) : commencing from behind, from the body of the sphenoid to the spine, the outer half of this margin is serrated, for articulation with the petrous portion of the temporal bone ; whilst the inner half forms the anterior boundary of the foramen lacerum medium, and presents the posterior aperture of the Vidian canal. In front of the spine the circumference of the great wing presents a serrated edge, bevelled at the expense of the inner table below, and of the external above, which articulates with the squamous portion of the temporal bone. At the tip of the great wing a triangular portion is seen, bevelled at the expense of the internal surface, for articu- lation with the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone. Internal to this is a broad serrated surface, for articulation with the frontal bone : this surface is continuous internally with the sharp inner edge of the orbital plate, which assists in the forma- tion of the sphenoidal fissure. The Lesser Wings (processes of Ingrassias) (fig. 34) are two thin triangular plates of bone, which arise from the upper and lateral parts of the body of the sphenoid; and, projecting transversely outwards, terminate in a sharp point. The superior surface of each is smooth, flat, broader internally than externally, and supports the anterior lobe of the brain. The inferior surface forms the back x>art of the roof of the orbit, and the upper boundary of tlie sphenoidal fissure or foramen lacerum antcrius. This fissui'C is of a triangular form, and leads from the cavity of the cranium into the orbit; it is bounded internally by the body of the sphenoid—above, by the lesser wing ; below, by the internal margin of the orbital surface of the great wing—and is converted into a foramen by the articulation of this bono with the frontal. It transmits the thii'd, the fourth, tlie ophthalmic division of the fifth and sixth nerves, and the ophthalmic vein. The anterior border of the lesser wing is serrated for articulation with the frontal bone; the posterior, smooth and rounded, is received into the fissure of Sylvius of the brain. The inner extremity of this border forms the anterior clinoid process. The lesser wing is connected to the side of the body by two roots, the upper thin and flat, the lower thicker, obliquely directed, and presenting on its outer side, near its junction with the body, a small tubercle, for the attachment of the common tendon of throe of the muscles of the eye. IJetwoen the two roots is the optic foramen, for the transmission of the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery.

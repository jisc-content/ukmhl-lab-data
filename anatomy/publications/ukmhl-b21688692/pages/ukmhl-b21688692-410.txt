Variations. The coronoid origin of this muscle presents numerous variations. It is occasionally absent, and in one case re- corded by Dr. Macalistor {Journal of Anat. and Phys. 2nd series, No. i, p. 9), it existed as a distinct muscle, inserted into the front of the radius higher up than the rest of the mass. In other cases the coronoid slip has been found connected with the Palmaris longus or the Flexor carpi radialis, instead of the Pronator teres, and other slighter anomalies have been recorded by Dr. Macalister. Relations. By its anterior surface, with the deep fascia, the Supinator longus, and tho radial vessels and nerve. By its posterior surface, with the Brachialis anticus. Flexor subHmis digitorum, the median nerve, and ulnar artery: the small, or deep, head being interposed between the two latter structures. Its outer lorder forms the inner boundary of a triangular space, in which is placed the brachial artery, median nerve, and tendon of the Bi- ceps muscle. Its inner harder is in contact with the Flexor carpi radialis. The Flexor Carpi Radialis lies on the inner side of the preceding muscle. It arises from the internal condyle by the common tendon, from the fascia of the forearm, and from the inter- muscular septa between it and the Pronator teres, on the outside; the Palmaris longus, internally ; and the Flexor subhmis digitorum, beneath. Slender and aponeurotic in structure at its commencement, it increases in size, and terminates in a tendon which forms the lower two-thirds of its length. This tendon passes through a canal on the outer side of the annular ligament, runs through a groove in the os trapezium (which is converted into a canal by a fibrous sheath, and lined by a synovial membrane), and is inserted into tho base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. The radial artery lies between the tendon of this muscle and the Supinator longus, and may easily be tied in this situation. Relations.

Struciure. The coats of the biliary ducts are, an external or fibrous, and an internal or mucous. The fibrous coat is composed of a strong areolai* fibrous tissue. The mucous coat is continuous with the lining membrane of the hepatic ducts and gall-bladder, and also with that of the duodenum. It is provided with numerous glands, the orifices of which are scattered irregularly in the larger ducts, but in the smaller hepatic ducts are disposed in two longitudinal rows, one on each side of the vessel. These glands are of two kinds. Some are ramified tubes, which occasionally anastomose, and from the sides of which saccular dilatations are given ofi"; others are small clustered cellular glands, which open either sepa- rately into the hepatic duct, or into the ductg of the tubular glands.

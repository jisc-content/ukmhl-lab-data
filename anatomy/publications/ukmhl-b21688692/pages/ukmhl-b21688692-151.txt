DEVELOPMENT OF SACRUM. 15 the under surface of the body of the last lumbar vertebra, bounded behind by the large triangular orifice of the sacral canal. This orifice is formed behind by the spinous process and lamin«e of the first sacral vertebra whilst projectmg from it on each side are the superior articular processes; they are oval, concave, directed backwards and inwards, like the superior articular processes of a lumbar vertebra; and in front of each articular process is an intervertebral notch, which forms the lower half of the last intervertebral foramen. Lastly, on each side ot the articular surface is a broad and flat triangular surface of bone, which extends outwards, and is continuous on each side with the iliac fossa. The Aj^ex, directed downwards and forwards, presents a small oval concave surface for articulation with the coccyx. •, • 1 The Sacral Canal runs throughout the greater part of the bone ; it is large and triangular in form above, small and flattened from before backwards below. In this situation, its posterior wall is incomplete, from the non-development of the laminre and spinous processes. It lodges . „ the sacral nerves, and is perforated by 17.-Development of Sacrum. ^^^^ ^^^^^.^^ posterior sacral fora- Additional utiOres mina, through which these pass out. Structure. It consists of much loose spongy tissue within, invested exter- nally by a thin layer of compact tissue. Qt birth V'*^ Wi&^* /} Differences in the Sacrum of the Male and Female. The sacrum in the female is usually wider thaD in the male ; and it is much less curved, the upper half of the bone being nearly straight, the lower half presenting the sreatest amount of curvature. The CD bone is also directed more obliquely backwards ; which increases the size of the pelvic cavity, and forms a more prominent sacro-vertebral angle. In the male, the curvature is more evenly At 4^ years. j distributed over the whole length of the bone, and is altogether greater than in the female. Peculiarities of the Sacr¥m. This bone, in some cases, consists of six pieces; occasionally, the number is re- duced to four. Sometimes the bodies of the first and second segments are ig not joined, or the laminsB and spinous processes have not coalesced.

The sacrum, also, varies con- siderably with respect to its degree of curvature. From the examination of a large number of skeletons, it would appear, that, in one set of cases, the anterior surface of this bone was nearly straight, the curvature, which was very 18.

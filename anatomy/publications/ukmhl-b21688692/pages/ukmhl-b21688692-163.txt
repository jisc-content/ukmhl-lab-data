The notch is continuous below with a long pointed process, the ""^tSZx Portion. Internal Surface (fig. 28). Along the middle line is a vertical groove, the edges of which unite below to form a ndge the frontal crest, the groove lodges the superior longitudinal sinus, whilst its edges afford attacH- ment to the falx cerebri. The crest terminates below at a small opening, the foramen coscum, which is generally completed behind by the ethmoid. This

Development of Occipital Bone. By Fom- Centres. al ivrtJi tie Jf-jtieati £OTtwn '.ial — 1 for each eon portion '^or bu,svLa,r ■portion pital part, which is formed in membrane; one for the basi- lar portion, and one for each condyloid portion, which are formed in cartilage. The centre for the occipi- tal portion appears about the tenth week of foetal life ; and consists, according to Blandin and Cruvelhier, of a small oblong plate which appears in the situation of the occi- pital protuberance.* The condyloid portions then ossify, and lastly the basilar portion. At birth, the bone consists of four parts, separate from one another, the occipital portion being fissured in the direction indicated in the plate above. At about the fourth year, the occipital and the two condyloid pieces join; and about the sixth year, the bone consists ot a single piece. At a later period, between the eighteenth and twenty-fafth years, the occipital and sphenoid become united, forming a single bone. Articulations. With six hones: two parietal, two temporal, sphenoid, and atlas. Attachment ofMxiscles. To the superior curved line are attached the Occipito- frontalis, Trapezius, and Stemo-cleido-mastoid.t To the space between the curved lines, the Complexus, Splenins capitis, and Obliquus superior; to the inferior curved line, and the space between it and the foramen magnum, the Rectus posticus major and minor ; to the transverse process, the Rectus lateralis ; and to the basilar process, the Rectus anticns major and minor, and Superior Constrictor of the pharynx. The Parietal Bokes. The Panrietal Bones (paries, a wall) form by their union the sides and roof of the skull. Bach bone is of an irregular quadrilateral form, and presents for' examination two surfaces, four borders and four angles. • B^clard considers this segment to have four centres of ossification, arranged in pairs, two ahove and two below the curved lines, and Meckel describes eight, four of which correspond in situation with those above described: of the other four, two are placed m juxtapoeition, at the upper angle of the hone, and the remaining two, one at each side, m the lateral angles. t To these the Biventer cervicis should be added, if it is regarded as a separate muscle.

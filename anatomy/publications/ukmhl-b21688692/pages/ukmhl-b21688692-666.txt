Thus two large trunks are formed, the upper one Iw the union of the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical; and the lower one by the pfo-hth cervical and first dorsal. These two trunks accompany the subclavian artery to the axilla, lying upon its outer side, the trunk formed by the union of the last cervical and first dorsal „ ,. , t>i being nearest to the vessel. 282.-Plan of the Brachial Plexus. Opposite the clavicle, and sometimes in the axilla, each of these cords gives oflF . a fasciculus, by the union of which a third ti-unk is formed, so that in the middle of the axilla three cords are found, one lying on the outer side of the axillary artery, one on its inner side, and one be- hind.* The brachial plexus communicates with the cervical plexus by a branch from the fourth to the fifth nerve, and with the phrenic nerve by a branch from the fifth cervical, which joins that nerve on the Anterior scalenus muscle : the cervical and first dor- sal nerves are also joined by filaments from the mid- dle and inferior cervical ganglia of the sympathetic, close to their oxit from the intervertebral foramina. ,..1 v^o n+ first between the Anterior ^elaUms.

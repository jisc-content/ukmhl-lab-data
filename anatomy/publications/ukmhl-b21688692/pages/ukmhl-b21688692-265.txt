TIBIA. 109.—Bones of the Right Leg. Auterior Surface. Jl e a tl 4 T2g Extmrutl Mallritttii K to compensate for the oblique direction of the femur inwards. It presents for examination a sliafb and two extremities. The Uijifer Extremity, or head, is large and expanded on each side into two lateral eminences, «the tuberosities. Superiorly, the 'tuberosities present two smooth concave surfaces, which aiiiiculate with the condyles of the femur; the internal articular surface is longer than the external, and oval from before backwards, to articulate with the internal condyle ; the external one being broader, flatter, and more circular, to articulate with the external condyle. Between the two articular sur- faces, and nearer the posterior than the anterior aspect of the bone, is an eminence, the spinous process of the tibia, surmounted by a prominent tubercle on each side, which gives attachment to the extremities of the semilunar fibro-cartilages; in _front and behind the spinous process is a rough depression for the attach- ment of the anterior and pos- terior crucial ligaments and the semilunar cartilages. The an- terior surfaces of the tuberosities are continuous with one another, forming a single large surface, which is somewhat flattened : it is triangiilar, broad above, and perforated by large vascular foramina, narrow below, where it terminates in a jarominent oblong elevation of large size, the tubercle of the tibia; the lower half of this tubercle is rough, for the attachment of the ligameutum patella); the upper half is a smooth facet corre- sponding, in the recent state, with a bursa which separates the ligament from the bone. Posteriorly, the tuberosities are separated from each other by a shallow depression, tlie popliteal notch, which gives attachment to the posterior crucial ligament. The posterior surface of the inner tuberosity presents a deep

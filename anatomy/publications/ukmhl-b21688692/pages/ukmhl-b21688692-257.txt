PELVIS. 121 I02.—Vertical Section of the Pelvis, with lines indicating the Axes of the Pelvis. beliind the symphysis pubis. In the female, the uterus and vagina occupy the interval between these parts. The loivei- circumference of the pelvis is very irregular, and forms what is called the outlet. It is bounded by three prominent eminences : one posterior, formed by the point of the coccyx; and one on each side, the tuberosities of the ischia. These eminences ai'e separated by three notches: one in front, the puhic arch, formed by the convergence of the rami of the ischia and pubes on each side. The other notches, one on each side, are formed by the sacrum and coccyx behind, the ischium in front, and the ilium above : they are called the sacro-sciatic notches ; in the natural state they are converted into foramina by the lesser and greater sacro-sciatic ligaments. The diameters of the outlet of the pelvis are two, antero-posterior and trans- verse. The antero-posterior extends from the tip of the coccyx to the lower part of the symphysis pubis, and the transverse from the posterior part of one ischiatic tuberosity to the same point on the opposite side: the average measurement of both is four inches. The antero-posterior diameter varies with the length of the coccyx, and is capable of increase or diminution, on account of the mobility of that bone. Position of the Pelvis. In the erect posture, the pelvis is placed obliquely with regard to the trunk of the body: the pelvic surface of the symphysis pubis looking up- wards and backwards, the con- cavity of the sacrum and coccyx looking downwards and forwards ; the base of the sacrum in well- formed female bodies, being nearly four inches above the upper border of the symphysis pubis, and the apex of the coccyx a little more than half an inch above its lower border.

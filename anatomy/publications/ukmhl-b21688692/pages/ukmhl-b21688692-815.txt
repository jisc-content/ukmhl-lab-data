The interspace or cavity between these two layers is called the cavity of ihe pleura. Each pleura is there- fore a shut sac, one occupying the right, the other the left half of the thorax ; and they are perfectly separate, not communicating with each other. The two pleursa do not meet in the middle line of the chest, excepting at one point in front; an interspace being left between them, which contains all the viscera of the thorax, excepting the lungs : this is the mediastinum. Beflectims of the pleura (fig. 370). Commencing at the sternum, the pleura passes outwards, covers the costal cartilages, the inner surface of the ribs and Intercostal muscles, and at the back part of the thorax passes over the thoracic ganglia and their branches, and is reflected upon the sides of the bodies of the vertebrae, where it is separated by a narrow interspace from the opposite pleura, the posterior medias- tinum. From the vertebral column the pleura passes to the side of the peri- cardium, which it covers to a slight extent; it then covers the back part of the root of the lung, from the lower border of which a triangular fold descends verti- cally by the side of the posterior mediastinum to the Diaphragm. This fold is the broad Hgament of the lung, the llgamentum latum puhnonis, and serves to retain the lower part of that organ in position. From the root, the pleura may be traced

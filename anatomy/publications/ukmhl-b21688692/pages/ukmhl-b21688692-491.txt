The branches of this vessel may be divided into an orbital group, which are distributed to the orbit and surrounding parts ; and an ocular group, which supply the muscles and globe of the eye, 2i3.-Tbe Ophthalmic Artery and its Branches, the Roof of the Orbit having been removed. Orlital Group. Ocular Group. Lachrymal. Muscular. Supraorbital. Anterior ciliary. Posterior ethmoidal. Short ciliary. Anterior ethmoidal. Long ciliary. Palpebral. Arteria centralis retinte. Frontal, Nasal. c The lachrymal is the first, and one of the largest branches, derived from the ophthalmic, arising close to the optic foramen: not unfrequently it is given off from the artery before it enters the orbit. It accompanies the lachrymal nerve along the upper border of the External rectus muscle, and is distributed to the achrymal gland Its termmal branches, escaping from the gland, are distributed to the upper cyehd and co^unctiva, anastomosing with the palpebral arteries. The achrymal artery gives off one or two malar branches; one of which passes ^r?t'JZT" " l' T the temporal fossa, and anastomoses ^l^llt^ J^"'^*^^ ^PP^^â„¢ ^^ ^^^ cheek, and anasto- ^moses with the transverse facial. A branch is also sent backwards, through the sphenoidal fissure, to the dum mater, which anastomoses with a branch of the 1^ middle meningeal artery.

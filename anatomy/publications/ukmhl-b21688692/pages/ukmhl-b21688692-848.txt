MALE GENPIRATIVE ORGANS. 7t2 389.—The Testis in situ. The Tunica Vaginalis liaviug been laid open. litTliea Vaginalis border, and connected to the back of the testis by a fold of the serous mem- brane. Attached to the upper end of the testis, or to the epididymis, is a small pedunculated body, the use of which is unknown. When the testicle is removed from the body, the position of the vas deferens, on its posterior and inner side, marks the side to which tlie gland has belonged. Size and Weight. The average dimen- sions of this gland are from one and a half to two inches in length, one inch in breadth, and an inch and a quarter in the antero-posterior diameter; and the weight varies from six to eight drachms, the left testicle being a little the larger. The testis is invested by three tunics, the tunica vaginalis, tunica albuginea, and tunica vasculosa. The Tunica Vaginalis is the serous covering of the testis. It is a pouch of serous membrane, derived from the peri- toneum during the descent of the testis in the foetus, from the abdomen into the scrotum. After its descent, that portion of the pouch which extends from the internal ring to near the upper part of the gland becomes obliterated, the lower portion remaining as a shut sac, which invests the outer surface of the testis, and is reflected on the internal surface of the scrotum ; hence it may be described as consisting of a visceral and parietal portion. The visceral portion (tunica vaginalis propria), covers the outer surface of the testis, as well as the epididymis, connecting the latter to the testis by means of a distinct fold. Erom the posterior border of the gland, it is reflected on to the internal surface of the scrotum. _ x • r. The parietal portion of the serous membrane (tunica vaginalis reflexa), is far more extensive than the visceral portion, extending upwards, for some distance in front, and on the inner side of the cord, and reaching below the testis. The inner surface of the tunica vaginalis is free, smooth, and covered by a layer of squamous epithelium. The interval between the visceral and parietal layers of this membrane constitutes the cavity of the tunica vaginalis. The Ttmica Albuginea is the fibrous covering of the testis. It is a dense fibrous membrane, of a bluish white colour, composed of bundles of white fibrous tissue which interlace in every direction. Its outer surface is covered by the tumca vaginalis except along its posterior border, and at the points of attachment of the epididymis ; hence the tunica albuginea is usually considered as a fibro-serous membrane like the dura mater and pericardium. This membrane surrounds the dandular 'structure of the testicle, and, at its posterior and upper bordei-, is Reflected into the interior of the gland, forming an incomplete vertical septum called the mediastinum testis (corpus Eiglimorianum). , . p The mediasUnum testis extends from the upper, nearly to the lower border ot the gland, and is wider above than below. From the front and sides of this septum numerous slender fibrous cords (traheculce) are given ofi", which pass to be attached to the inner surface of the tunica albuginea : they serve to maintain the form of the testis, and join with similar cords given off" from the inner surface of the tunica albuginea, to form spaces which enclose the separate lobules ot the organ. The mediastinum supports the vessels and ducts of the testis m their passage to and from the substance of the gland. The Tunica Vascidosa (pia mater testis), is the vascular layer ot the testis,

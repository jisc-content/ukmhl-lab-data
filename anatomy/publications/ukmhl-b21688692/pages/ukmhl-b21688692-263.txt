In the lower end, the cancelli spring on all sides from the inner surface of the cylinder, and descend in a perpendicular direction to the articular surface, the cancelli being strongest and having a more accurately perpendicular course above the condyles. Articulations. With three bones : the os innominatum, tibia, and patella. Development (fig. 106). The femur is developed by five centres : one for the shaft, one for each ex- tremity, and one for each trochanter. Of all the long bones, except the clavicle, it is the first to show traces of ossification ; this commences in the shaft, at about the fifth week of foetal life, the centres of ossifica- tion in the epiphyses appearing in the following order: First, in the lower end of the bone, at the ninth month of festal life ; from this the condyles and tuberosities are formed ; in the head, at the end of the first year after birth; in the great trochanter, during the fourth year; and in the lesser trochanter, between the thirteenth and four- teenth. The order in which the epiphyses are joined to the shaft, is the reverse of that of their appear- ance ; their junction does not com- mence until after puberty, the lesser trochanter being fii-st joined, then the greater, then the head, and, lastly, the inferior extremity (the first in which ossification com- menced), which is not united until . the twentieth year.

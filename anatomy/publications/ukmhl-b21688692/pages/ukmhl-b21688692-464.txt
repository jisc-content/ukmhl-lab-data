A section of the aorta opposite this part has a somewhat triangular figure ; but below the attachment ot the valves it is circular. This portion of the heart is contained in the cavity of the pericardium, and, together with the pulraonaiy artery, is invested in a tube ot serous membrane, continued on to them from the surface of the heart.

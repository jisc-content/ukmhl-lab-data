542 SPINAL NERVES. The moclo in which tho plexus is formed is the following :~The first lumbar nerve gives off tho ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal nerves, and a communicating branch to the second lumbar nerve. The second gives oH" the external cutaneous and genito-crural, and a communicating branch to tho third nerve. The third nerve gives a descending lilament to the fourth, and divides into two branches, which assist in forming >fche anterior crural and obturator nerves; sometimes, also it furnishes a part of the accessory obturator. The fourth nerve completes the formation of the anterior crural, and tho obturator, and gives off a communi- catino- branch to the fifth lumbar ; sometimes it also furnishes part of the accessory obturator. The branches of the lumbar plexus are the Ilio-hypogastric. Ilio-inguinal. Genito-crural. External cutaneous. Obturator. Accessory obturator. Anteiior crural. These branches may be divided into two groups, according to their mode of distribution. One group, including the iho-hypogastric, ilio-inguinal, and part of the genito-crural nerves, supplies the lower part of the parietes of the abdomen ; 287.—The Lumbar Plexus and its Branches. tie otWr gronp. whicl, includes t.,o remainfag .erves, supplies tLe fore part of tho '"^T^Tiuo-h^^IsSkIvk (,„,„rio,.™«.cn(«..to.o...) arises from tl.c first

The papilla) apparently resemble in structm-e those of the cutis, consisting of a cone-shaped projection of homogenous tissue, covered with a thick layer of squamous epithelium, and contain one or more capillary loops amongst which nerves arc distributed in great abundance. If the epithelium is removed,'it will be found that they are not simple processes like the papdlas of the skin for the surface of each is studded with minute conical processes of the mucous membrane, which form secondary papUliB (Todd and Bowman). In the papilliB circumvallatas, the nerves are numerous and of large size; m the papillas fun<-iformes they are also numerous, and terminate in a plexiform net-work from which brush.like branches proceed ; in the papilla filiformes, their mode ot ter- mination is uncertain. â–  -j j -xt. Besides the pa,pilte, the mucous membrane of the tongue is provided with numerous folHcles and glands. . The follicles are found scattered over its entire surface, but are especially numerous between the papilla? circumvallatae and the epiglottis. The mucous glands (Ungual), similar in structure to the labial and buccal, are found chiefly beneath the mucous membrane of the posterior third of the dorsum of the tongue. There is a small group of these glands beneath the tip ot the tongue, a few along the borders of the organ, a,nd some infrontof thecircumvallate papillae projecting in the muscular substance. Their ducts open either upon the surface, or into the depressions round the large papillse. . ^ . The epithelium is of the scaly variety like that of the epidermis. It covers the free surface of the tongue, as may be easily demonstrated by maceration, or bod- ng when it can be detached entire: it is much thinner than m the skm: tlie inSrvals between the large papilla, are not filled up by it. but each papilla has a separate investment from root to summit.

Each half is composed of muscular fibres arrang din various directions, containing much interposed fat and supplied by vessel! and nerves : the entire organ is invested by mucous membrane, and a sub- mucous fibrous stratum.

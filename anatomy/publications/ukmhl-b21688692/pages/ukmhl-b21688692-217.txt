RIBS. 8i intercostal muscle. The inferior edge corresponds to the lower margin of the rib, and gives attachment to the External intercostal. Within the groove are seen the orifices of numerous small foramina, which traverse the wall of the shaft obliquely from before backwards. The superior border, thick and rounded, is marked by an external and an internal lip, more distinct behind than in front; they serve for the attachment of the External and Internal intercostal muscles. The inferior border, thin and sharp, has attached the External intercostal muscle. The anterior or sternal extremity is flattened, and presents a porous oval concave depression, into which the costal cartilage is received. Peculiae Ribs. The ribs which require especial consideration are five in number, viz., the first, second, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth. The first rib (fig. 77) is one of the shortest and the most curved of all the ribs ; it is broad, flat, and placed horizontally at the upper part of the thorax, its surfaces looking upwards and downwards; and its borders inwai-ds and outwards. The head is of small size, rounded, and presents only a single articular facet for arti- culation with the body of the first dorsal vertebra. The nech is narrow and rounded. The tuberosity, thick and prominent, rests on the outer border. There is no angle, and the shaft is not twisted on its axis. The upper surface of the shaft is marked by two shallow depressions, separated from one another by a ridge, which becomes more prominent towards the internal border, where it terminates in a tubercle : this tubercle and ridge serve for the attachment of the Scalenus anticus muscle, the groove in front of it transmitting the subclavian vein : that behind it, the subclavian artery. Between the groove for the subcla- vian artery apd the tuberosity is a depression for the attachment of the Scalenus medins muscle. The under surface is smooth, and destitute of the groove observed on the other ribs. The oider border is convex, thick, and rounded ; the inner, concave, thin, and sharp, and marked about its centre by the tubercle before mentioned. The anterior extremity is larger and thicker than any of the other ribs. The second rib (fig. 78) is much longer than the first, but bears a very con- siderable resemblance to it in the direction of its curvature. The non-articular portion of the tuberosity is occasionally only slightly marked. The angle is slight, and situated close to the tuberosity, and the shaft is not twisted, so that both ends touch any plane surface upon which it may be laid. The shaft is not horizontal, hke that of the first rib ; its outer surface, which is convex, looking upwards and a httle outwards. It presents, near the middle, a rough eminence for the attach- ment of the second and third digitations of the Serratus magnus. The inner surface, smooth and concave, is directed downwards and a little inwards • it presents a short groove towards its posterior part. The tenth rib (fig. 79) has only a single articular facet on its head. The ehventhj,nd twelfth ribs (figs. 80 and 81) have each a single articular facet on the head which is of rather large size ; they have no neck or tuberosity, and are pointed at the extremity.

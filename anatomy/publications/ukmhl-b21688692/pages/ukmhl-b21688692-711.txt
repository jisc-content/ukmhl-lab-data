575 CHOROID AND IRIS. posterior elastic lamina. lb consists of a single layer of polygonal transparent nucleated cells, similar to tlioso found lining other serous cavities. Arteries and Nerves. The cornea is a non-vascular structure, the capillary vessels terminating in loops at its ch-cumference. Lymphatic vessels have not as yet been demonstrated in it. The nerves are numerous, twenty or thirty in number: they are derived from the ciliary nerves, and enter the laminated sub- stances of the cornea. They ramify throughout its substance in a delicate net- work. Dissection. In order to separate the sclerotic and cornea, so as to expose the second tunic, the eyeball should be immersed iu a small vessel of water. A fold of the sclerotic near its anterior part having been pinched up, an operation not easily performed, from the extreme tension of the membrane, it should be divided with a pair of blunt-pointed scissors. As soon as the choroid is exposed, the end of a blow-pipe should be introduced into the orifice, and a stream of air forced into it, so as to separate the slight cellular connection between the sclerotic and choroid. The sclerotic should now be divided around its entire circumference, and may be removed in separate portions. The front segment being then drawn forwards, the handle of the scalpel should be pressed gently against it at its connection with the iris, and these being separated, a quantity of perfectly transparent fluid will escape ; this is the aqueous humour. In the course of the dissection, the ciliary nerves may be seen lying in the loose cellular tissue between the choroid and sclerotic, or contained in delicate grooves on jthe inner surface of the latter membrane. 302.—The Choroid and Iris.

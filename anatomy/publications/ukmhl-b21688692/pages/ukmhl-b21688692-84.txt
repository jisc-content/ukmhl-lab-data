GJiiNERAL ANATOMY. ixxx flat plate. This nerve-end-plate is sometimes more like a membrane, at others like a system of fibres. In most cases the plate rests upon a base of grannies and finely-granular protoplasm; in other cases, there is no such support, and the nerve-plates then possess the so-called nerve-end- bulbs. Tlie ends of the nerves never penetrate the interior of the con- tractile cylinder, nor does the plate ever embrace the whole circumference Fiff.

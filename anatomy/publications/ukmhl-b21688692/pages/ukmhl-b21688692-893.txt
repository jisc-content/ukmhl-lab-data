PELVIC FASCIA. 757 bladder, forming the lateral true ligaments of the organ. Another prolongation invests the vesiculte serainales, and passes across between the bladder and rectum, being continuous with the same fascia of the opposite side. Another thm pro- longation is reflected round the surface of the lower end of the rectum. The Levator ani muscle arises from the point of division of the pelvic fascia; the visceral layer of the fascia descending upon and being intimately adherent to the upper surface of the muscle, while the under surface of the muscle is covered by a thin layer derived from the obturator fascia, called the ischio-rectal or anal fascia. In the female, the vagina perforates tbe recto-vesical fascia, and receives a prolongation from it.

The Anterior Ligament is a broad membranous band, consisting of three fasci- culi attached, above, to the anterior margin of the lower end of the radius, its sMoid process, and the ulna; its fibres pass downwards and inwards, to be inserted into the palmar surface of the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform boncB This ligament is perforated by numerous apertures for the passage of ves-ls, and if in relation, in front, with the tendons of the Flexor profundus dig^torum and Flexor longus polhcis ; behind, with the synovial membrane of the ^""^tttosterior Ligament (fig. 135), less thick and strong than the anterior, is at- tached above, to the posterior border of the lower end of the radiusj its fibres pass obWely downwards and inwards to be attached to the dorsal surface 0 the sea- sLilunar. and cuneiform bones, being continuous with those of the dorsal Srti laments. This ligament is in relation, behind with the extensor tendons nf the fineers • in front, with the synovial membrane of the wrist.

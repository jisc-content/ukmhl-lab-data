All the muscles of the superficial luyer are supplied hy the median nerve, excepting the Flexor carpi uluarls, which is supplied by the uh,ar. Of the deep layer the Flexor profundus digitorum is supplied conjointly by the ulnar and by the'median, through its branch, the anterior interosseous nerve, which also supplies the Flexor longus pollicis and Pronator quadratus. Actions. These muscles act upon the forearm, the wrist, and hand. Those acting on the forearm, are the Pronator radii tor-es and Pronator Quadratus, which rotate the radius upon the ulna, rendering the hand prone ; when pronation has been fully effected, the Pronator radii teres assists the other muscles in flexing tlie forearm. The flexors of the wrist are the Flexor carpi ulrmris and radialis; and the flexors of the phalanges are the Flexor sublimis and Profundus digitorum ; the former flexing the second phalanges, and the latter the last. The Flexor longus pollicis flexes the last phalanx of the thumb. The three latter muscles, after flexing the phalanges, by continuing their action, act upon the wrist, assisting the ordinary flexors of this joint; and all those which are attached to the humerus assist in flexing the forearm upon the arm. The Pulmaris longus is a tensor of the palmar fascia ; when tMs action has been fully eflected, it flexes the hand upon the forearm. Radui Region. '(Fig. i74.) Supinator Longus.

The Supmator Longus is the most superficial muscle on the radial .ide of the forearm • it is fleshy for the upper two-thirds of its extent, tendinous below. It arises from the upper two-thirds of the external condyloid x;idge of the humerus, anl from the external intermuscular septum, being hmited above by the muscu o- smrairoove.

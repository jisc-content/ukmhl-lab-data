The chief peculiarities in the heart of the foetus, are the direct communicati^^^^ between the Wo auricles through the foramen ovale, and the large size of the EusTachian valve. There are also several minor peculiarities. Thus the position of the heart is vertical untH the fourth month, when it commences to assume an oblique direction. Its size is also very considerable, as compared with the body, the proportion at the second month being as i to 50 : at birth it is as i to 120 : whilst, in the adult, the average is about i to 160. At an early period of foetal life, the auricular portion of the heart is larger than the ventricular, the right auricle bemg more capacious than the left ; but, towards birth, the ventricular portion becomes the larger. The thickness of both ventricles is, at first, about equal; but, towards birth, the left becomes much the thicker of the two. The foramen ovale is situated at the lower and back part of the septum auricu- larum, forming a communication between the auricles. It attains its greatest size at the sixth month. . , , o ,1 • r • The Eustachian valve is developed from the anterior border of the inferior vena cava at its entrance into the auricle. It is directed upwards on the left side of the opening of this vein, and serves to direct the blood from the inferior vena cava through the foramen ovale into the left auricle. The peculiarities in the arterial system of the foetus are the communication between the pulmonary artery and descending part of the arch of the aorta, by means of the ductus arteriosus, and the communication between the internal iliac arteries and the placenta, by means of the umbilical arteries. The ductus arteriosus is a short tube, about half an inch in length at birth, and of the diameter of a goose-quill. In the early condition, it forms the con- tinuation of the pulmonary artery, and opens into the arch of the aorta, just below the origin of the left subclavian artery; and so conducts the chief part of the blood from the right ventricle into the descending aorta. When the branches of the pulmonary arteiy have become larger relatively to the ductus arteriosus, the latter is chiefly connected to the left pulmonary artery ; and the fibrous cord, which is all * If the general idea of this is not at once obvious, it will become so by taking a roll of paper, calling one side of it the posterior and the other the anterior, and bending it at the right side of its middle till the anterior touches the posterior surfnee. The larger part to the left of the middle line represents the left ventricle, the smaller the right, and the double fold in the middle the septum ; then, if the reflected parts where they touch are gummed to each other, this will represent the coalescence of the septum with the outer wall, whereby the right ventricle borrows a separate tube from the left. The lower openings of these two tubes are closed in by the growth of the external layers. f For full and accurate descriptions of the nerves and ganglia of the heart, the student is referred to Dr. K. Lee's papers on the siibjc ct.

Fracture of thn fibula, xoith displace- mmt of the tibia (hg. 204), commonly known as ' Pott's Fracture,' is one of the most frequent injuries of the ankle- joint. The end of the tibia is displaced from the corresponding surface of the astragalus ; the internal lateral ligament is ruptured ; and the inner malleolus projects inwards bcneatli the integu- ment, which is tiglitly stretched over it, and in danger of bursting. The fibula is broken, usually from two to three inches above the ankle, and occa- sionally that portion of the tibia with which it is more directly connected be- low ; the foot is everted by the action of the Peroneus longus, its inner border resting upon the ground, and, at the same time, the heel is drawn up by the muscles of the calf. This injury may be at once reduced by flexing the leg at right angles with the thigh, which relaxes all the opposing muscles, and by making slight extension from the knee and ankle. On the Descriptive Anatomy of the Muscles, refer to Cruveilhier's ' Anatomie Descrip- tive ;' 'Traitede Myologie et d'Angeiologie,'by F. G. Theile, Encyclopedie Anatomique, Paris, 1843 ; and Henle's ' liandbuch der Systematischen Anatomic,' before referred to.

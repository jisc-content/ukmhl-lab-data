531 To arm, fore-arm, and hand Lesser internal cutaneous. ANTERIOR THORACIC. The communicating Iranch with the phrenic is derived from the fifth cervical nerve ; it joins the phrenic on the Anterior scalenus muscle. The muscular branches supply the Longus colli, Scaleni, Rhomboidei, and Subclavius muscles. Those for the Scaleni and Longus colli arise from the lower cervical nerves at their exit from the intervertebral foramina. The rhomboid branch arises from the fifth cervical, pierces the Scalenus medius, and passes beneath the Levator anguli scapute, which it occasionally supphes, to the Rhom- boid muscles. The nerve to the Subclavius is a small filament, which arises from the trunk formed by the junction of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves ; it descends in front of the subclavian artery to the Subclavius muscle, and is usually connected by a filament with the phrenic nerve. The posterior thoracic nerve (long thoraic, external respiratory of Bell), (fig. 285), supplies the Serratus magus, and is remarkable for the length of its course. It ai'ises by two roots, from the fifth and sixth cervical nerves, immediately after their exit from the intervertebral foramina. These unite in the substance of the Middle scalenus muscle, and, after emerging from it, the nerve passes down behind the brachial plexus and the axillary vessels, resting on the outer surface of the Serratus magnus. It extends along the side of the chest to the lower border of that muscle, and supplies it with numerous filaments. The suprascapular nerve (fig. 286) arises from the cord formed by the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves; passing obliquely outwards beneath the Tra- pezius, it enters the supraspinous fossa, through the notch in the upper border of the scapula; and, passing beneath the Supraspinatus muscle, curves in front of the spine of the scapula to the infraspinous fossa. In the supraspinous fossa, it gives ofi'two branches to the Supraspinatus muscle, and an articular filament to the shoulder-joint; and in the infraspinous fossa, it gives off two branches to the Infraspinatus muscle, besides some filaments to the shoulder-joint and scapula.

The branches given off below the clavicle, are derived from the three cords of the brachial plexus, m the following manner : From the outer cord, arises the external of the two anterior thoracic nerves, the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and the outer head of the median. ^ From the inner cord, arises the internal of the two anterior thoracic nerves, the internal cutaneous, the lesser internal cutaneous (nerve of Wrisberg), the ulnar and inner head of the median. From the posterior cord, arise the three subscapular nerves ; and the cord then divides into the musculo-spiral and circumflex nerves. muscfes. ^^^^^^ ^^S), two in number, supply the Pectoral .0 J nf 'tT^' I" r^r^'^^^ larger of the two, arises from the outer an^islil'W ^^^^^ axillary artery and vein, ZlZ^^^tt T^^'' ^^^^^ -'-^jo- It sends down a commumcatmg filament to join the internal branch hetllVtTf--^" ^"^^^ ^^'^^ cord, and passes upwards wtrthefit rn ; (sometimes perforates the vein), and joins Ire dLtrib T '1 '^P'"^"'^^ ^^^^ loop thus formed, branches are distributed to the under surface of the Pectoralis minor and major muscles.

The head (fig. 76) iB marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface, divided by a liorizontal ridi^c into two facets for articulation witli the costal cavity formed by the junction of the bodies of two contiguous dorsal vertebra.; the Tipper facet is small, the inferior one of large size; the ndge separatmg them servos for the attachment of the intcrarticular ligament. 76.—Vertebral Extremity of a Rib.

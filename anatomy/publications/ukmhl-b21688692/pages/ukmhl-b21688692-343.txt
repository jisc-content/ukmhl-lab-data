Ceanial Region—Occipito-Frontalis. Dissection (fig. 147). The head being shaved, and a block placed beneath the back of the neck make a vertical incision through the skin from before backwards, commencing at the root of the nose in front, and terminating behind at the occipital protuberance ; make a second incision in a horizontal direction along the forehead and round the side of the 147.—Dissection of the Head, Face, and Neck. head, from the anterior to the posterior extremity of the preceding. Raise the skin in front from the subjacent muscle from below upwards; this must be done with extreme care, removing the integument from the outer surface of the vessels and the nerves which lie between the two. The superficial fascia is the cranial region in a firm, dense layer, intimately adherent to the integument, and to the Occipito-frontalis and its tendinous aponeu- rosis ; it is continuous, behind, with the superficial fascia at the back part of the neck; and, laterally, is continued over the temporal aponeurosis: it contains

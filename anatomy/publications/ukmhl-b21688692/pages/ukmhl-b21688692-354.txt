Lt^ antenor manjin projects over the Buccinator muscle ; and the facial artery lies onxt below. i^e temporal fascia is seen, at this stage of the dissection, coverxng xn the Temporal muscle It is a strong aponeurotic investment, atfordmg attachment, by its inner sux-face, to the superficial fibres of the muscle. Above xt xs a sxngle layer, attached to the eixtiro extent of the temporal ridge ; bxxt below, where xt xs attached to the zygoma, it consists of two layers, one ot whxch xs xnsertcd mto the outer and the other into the inner border of the zygomatic arch. A small quantity of fat the orbital branch of the temporal artery, and a filament from the orbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve, are contained between ttese two layers. It is covered, on its outer surface, by the aponeurosxs of the Occxpito-frontalxs, the Orbicularis palpebrarum, the Attollens and Attrahens aurem muscles; the temporal vessels and nerves cross it from below upwards. IS I .-The Temporal Muscle, the Zygoma aud Masseter having been removed. is then exposed. The Temporal (fig. 151) ^ ^^^oad radiating muscle, situated at the side of ttie head, and occupying the entire extent of the temporal fossa. It arxses f^^^"^^^;^^^^^^^ of the temporal fossa, which extends from the external angular process of the fi ontol in front, to the mastoid portion of the temporal behind ; and from the «>i^^^d Ime on the frontal and parietal bones above, to the pterygoid i-xdge on the g^e^^ win of the sphenoid below. It is also attached to the inner sui'face of the temporal fascia.

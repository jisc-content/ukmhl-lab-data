It consists of a curved horizonta portion the body, and two perpendicular portions, the rami, which join the back part ot the body nearly at right angles. _ i +r „ „^ri Ihe Eorizontal portion, or body (fig. 56), is convex in its general outline^and curved somewhat Hke a horse-shoe. It presents for examination two surfaces 56.—Inferior Maxillary Bone. Outer Surface. Side View. and two borders. The external surface is convex from side to side, concave from above downwards. In the median line is a vertical ridge, the symphysis, which extends from the upper to the lower border of the bone, and indicates the point of junction of the two pieces of which the bone is composed at an early period of life. The lower part of the ridge terminates in a prominent triangular eminence the mental process. On cither side of the symphysis, just below the roots of the incisor teeth, is a depression, the incisive fossa, for the attachment of the Levator menti (or Levator labii inferioris) ; and still more externally, a foramen, tho

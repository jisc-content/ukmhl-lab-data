The serous layer invests the heart, and is then reflected on the inner surface of the pericardium. It consists, therefore, of a visceral and a parietal poi-tion. The former invests the surface of the heart, and the commencement of the great vessels, to the extent of two inches from their origin ; from these, it ia reflected upon the inner surface of the fibrous layer, lining, below, the upper surface of the central tendon of the Diaphragm. The serous membrane encloses the aorta and pulmo- nary artery in a single tube ; but it only partially covers the superior and inferior vena cava and the four pulmonaiy veins. Its inner surface is smooth and glistening, and secretes a thin fluid, which serves to facilitate the movements of the heart.

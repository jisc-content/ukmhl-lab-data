Ixxiv GENERAL ANATOMY. spinal axis, and the sympathetic or ganglionic nerves, which proceed from the ganglia of the sympathetic. flH The Gerehro-spinal nerves consist of numerous nerve-fibres, collected together and enclosed in a membranous sheath. A small bundle of primitive fibres, enclosed in a tubular sheath, is called funiculus: if the nerve is of small size it may consist only of a single funiculus, but if large, the funiculi are coUected together into larger bundles or fasciculi; and are bound together in a common membranous investment, termed the sheath. In structure, the common sheath investing the whole nerve, as well as the septa given off from the sheath, and which separate the fasciculi, consist of areolar tissue, composed of white and yellow elastic fibres, the latter existing in greatest abundance. The tubular sheath of the funiculi, or neurilemma, consists of a fine, smooth, transparent mem- brane, which may be easily separated, in the form of a tube, from the fibres it encloses; in structure, it is, for the most part, a simple and homogeneous transparent film, occasionaUy composed of numerous mmute reticular fibres. . i The cerebro-spinal nerves consist almost exclusively of the tubular nerve-fibres, the gelatinous fibres existing in very small proportion. The blood-vessels supplying a nerve terminate in a minute capiUary plexus, the vessels composing which run, for the most part, paraUel with the funiculi; they are connected together by short transverse vessels, forming narrow oblong meshes, similar to the capillary system of muscle The nerve-fibres, as far as is at present known, do not coalesce, but pursue an uninterrupted course from the centre to the periphery. In separating a nerve, however, into its component funiculi, it may be seen that they do not pursue a perfectly insulated course, but occasionaUy join at a. very acute angle with other funiculi proceeding in the same direc- tion- from which again, branches are given off, to join agam m like manner with other funiculi. It must be remembered, however, that in these communications the nerve-fibres do not coalesce, but merely pass into the sheath of the adjacent nerve, become intermixed mth its nerve- fibres, and again pass on to become blended with the nerve-fibres m some "^t^IttSco^se, subdivide into branches, and these frequei^ly communiclte with branches of a neighbouring nerve. t^^;^â€” of a nerve, the filaments of which it is composed "^^'^^^^^^^ trunk into the branches, and at their junction with ^1^^ ^^'^l^f J' Sghbouring nerves the filaments pass to become intermixed with those of the other nerve in their further progress, in no instance, however, have the separate nerve-fibres been shown to inosculate.

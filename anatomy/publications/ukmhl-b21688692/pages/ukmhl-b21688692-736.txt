OIIGANS OF SENSE. 6oo The scala media is closed above and below. The upper blind extremity is attached to the cupola at the upper part of the helicotreraa, the lower end fits into the angle at the commencomoiit of the osseous lamina on the floor of the vestibule. Near this blind extremity the scala media receives the ca/tialis reuniens (fig. 318), a very delicate canal, by which the ductus cochlearis is brought into continuity with the saccule. Tho inner surface of the osseous labyrinth is lined by an exceedingly thin fibro-serous membrane, analogous to a periosteum, from its close adhesion to the inner surfaces of these cavities, and performing the oflBce of a serous membrane by its free surface. It linos the vestibule, and from this cavity is continued into the semicircular canals and the scala vestibuli of the cochlea, and through the heli- cotrema into the scala tympani. Two delicate tubular processes are pj'olonged along tlie aqueducts of the vestibule and cochlea, to the inner surface of the dura mater. "This membrane is continued across the fenesti'a ovalis and rotunda, and consequently has no communication with the lining membrane of the tympanum. Its attached surface is rough and fibrous, and closely adherent to the bone; its free surface is smooth and -pale, covered with a layer of epithelium, and secretes a thin, limpid fluid, the aqua lahyrinthi (perilymph [Blainvillc], liquor Cotunnii). The Membrakous Labyrinth. The membranous labyrinth (fig. 318) is a closed membranous sac, containing fluid. The ramifications of the auditory nerve are distributed upon the wall of the sac. It has the same general form as the vestibule and semicircular canals in which it is enclosed; but is considerably smaller, and separated from their Hning Efiembrane by the perilymph. The vestibular portion cons^ists of two sacs, the utricle and the saccule. The utricle is the larger of the two, of an oblong form, compressed laterally, and qccupies the upper and back part of the vestibule, lying in contact with the fovea ,semi-elliptica. Numerous filaments of the auditory nerve are distributed on the 318.â€”The Membranous Labyrinth.

The saccule is the smaller of the two vestibular sacs ; it is globular in form, hes in the fovea hemispherica, pear the opening of the vestibular scala of the cochlea, and receives numerous nervous filaments, which enter from the bottom of the depression in which it is contained. Its cavity is apparently distinct from that of the utricle. , . j xi j- 1. p +1 The memhramous semicircular canals are .^bout one-third the diameter ot tiio osseous canals, but in number, shape, and general form they ai-e precisely similar;

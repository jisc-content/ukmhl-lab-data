PHALANGES. 143 Phalanges. The Phalanges of the foot, both in number and general arrangement, resemble those in the hand ; there being two in the great toe, and three in each of the other toes. The phalanges of the first roio resemble closely those of the hand. The shaft is compressed from side to side, convex above, concave below. The posterior extremiUj is concave; and the anterior extremity presents a trochlear surface, for articulation with the second phalanges. The phalanges of the second row are remarkably small and short, but rather broader than those of the first row. The tW(7MaZ phalanges, in form, resemble. those of the fingers ; but they are smaller, flattened from above downwards, presenting a broad base for articulation with the second row, and an expanded extremity for the support of the nail and end of the toe. Articulation. The first row, with the metatarsal bones, and second phalanges ; the second of the great toe, with the first phalanx, and of the other toes, with the first and third phalanges; the thii-d with the second row. Attachment of Muscles. To the first phalanges, great toe : innermost tendon of Extensor brevis digitorum. Abductor polHcis, Adductor pollicis, Flexor brevis pollicis, Transversus pedis. Second toe: First and Second dorsal interosseous Third toe : Third dorsal and First plantar interosseous. Fourth toe : Fourth dorsal and Second plantar interosseous. Fifth toe : Flexor brevis minimi digiti Abductor minimi digiti, and Third plantar interosseous.—Second phalanges, great toe • Extensor longus polhcis. Flexor longus pollicis. Other toes : Flexor brevis dim' torum, one slip from the Extensor brevis digitorum (except in the little toe) and Extensor longus digitoram.—Third phalanges : two slips from the common tendon of the Extensor longus and Extensor brevis digitorum, and the Flexor longus dia-i torum. ° ° Development op the Foot. (Fig. 115.) The Tarsal bones are each developed by a single centre, excepting the os calcis which has an epiphysis for its posterior extremity. The centres make their appear' ance m the following order : os calcis, at the sixth month of foetal life ; astragalus about the seventh month; cuboid, at the ninth month; external cuneiform' during the first year; mternal cuneiform in the third year; middle cuneiform and scaphoid m the fourth year. The epiphysis for the posterior tuberosity of the pub^ty ^""^ rest of the bone soon after The Metatarsal bones are each developed by tivo centres : one for the shaft, and one for the digital extremity, in the four outer metatarsal; one for the shaft, and one for the base, m the metatarsal bone of the great toe.

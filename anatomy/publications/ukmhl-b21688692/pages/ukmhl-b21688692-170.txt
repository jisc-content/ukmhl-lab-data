ZVf mo 1 for AuditoTij jirvecss I for Fi>tTaus Mastvul matter is deposited in the vertebras; the auditory process succeeds next ; it consists of a curved piece of bone, forming about three-fourths of a cir- cle, the deficiency being above; it is oTooved along its concave surface forlihe attachment of the membrana tympani, and becomes united by its extremities to the squamous portion during the last months of intra- uterine life. The petrous and mastoid portions then become ossified, and lastly the styloid process, which re- mains separate a considerable period, and is occasionally never united to the V*"" StyJoiiprcc rest of the bone. At birth, the tem- ^„„o noral bone excluding the styloid process, is formed of three pieces-the squamous Td lygTltic, the petrous Ld mastoid, and the auditory. The auditory proce s Sns wfth the squamous about the time of birth.

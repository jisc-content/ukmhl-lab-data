331 ARCH OF AORTA. viscera of tlio thoracic and abdominal caviUed are transposed. Less frequently, the aorta, after archiu- over the root of the right lung, is directed to its usual position on the left side of the spine^this peculiarity not being accompanied by any transposition of the viscera. In Conformation. The aorta occasionally divides, as in some quadrupeds, into an ascending and a descending trunk, the former of which is directed vertically upwards, and subdivides into three branches, to supply the head and upper extremities. Sometimes the aorta sub- divides soon after its origin into two branches, which soon reunite. In one of these pases, the cEsophagus and trachea were found to pass through the interval left by their division; this is the normal condition of the vessel in the reptilia. Sttrgical Anatomy. Of all the vessels of the arterial system, the aorta, and more especially its arch, is most frequently the seat of disease ; hence it is important to consider some of the consequences that may ensue from aneurism of this part. _ . It will bo remembered, that the ascending pai't of the arch is contained in the pericardium, just behind the sternum, being crossed at its commencement by the pulmonary artery and right auricular appendix, and having the root of the right lung behind, the vena cava on the right side, and the pulmonary artery and left auricle on the left side. Aneurism of the ascending aorta, in tlie situation of the aortic sinuses, in the great majority of cases, affects the right coronary sinus ; this is mainly owing to the fact that the regurgitation of blood upon the sinuses takes place chiefly on the right anterior aspect of the vessel. As the anenrismal sac enlarges, it may compress any or all of the structures in immediate proximity with it, but chiefly projects towards the right anterior side; and, consequently, interferes mainly with those structures that have a coiTesponding relation with the vessel. In the majority of cases, it bursts into the cavity of the pericardium, the patient suddenly drops down dead, and, upon a post-mortem examination, the pericardial sac is found full of blood: or it may compress the right auricle, or the pulmonary artery, and adjoining part of the right ventricle, and open into one or the other of these parts, or may press upon the superior cava. Aneurism of the ascending aorta, originating above the sinuses, most frequently impli- cates the right anterior wall of the vessel; this is probably mainly owing to the blood being impelled against this part. The direction of the aneurism is also chieiBy towards the right of the median line. If it attains a large size and projects forwards, it may absorb the sternum and the cartilages of the ribs, usually on the right side, and appear as a pulsating tumour on the front of the chest, just below the manubrium ; or it may burst into the peri- cardium, or may compress, or open into, the right lung, the trachea, broncbi, or oesophagus. Regarding the transverse part of the arch, the student is reminded that the vessel lies on the trachea, the oesophagus, and thoracic duct; that the recurrent laryngeal nerve winds around it; and that from its upper part are given off three large trunks, which or It may ultimately burst into that tube, producing fatal haBmoiThage. Again, its pressure' on the laryngeal nerves may give rise to symptoms which so accurately resemble those of laryngitis, that the operation of tracheotomy has in some cases been resorted to, from the supposition that disease existed in the larynx; or it may press upon the thoracic duct, and destroy life by mamtion; or it may involve the oesophagus, producing dysphagia; or may burst into the oesophagus, when fatal hfemorrhage will occur. Again, the innominate, artery, or the left carotid, or subclavian, may be so obstructed by clots, as to produce a weakness, or even a disappearance, of the pulse in one or the other wrists; or the tumour f .1 f °ianubrium, generally either in the median line, or to neck! sternum, and may simulate an aneurism of one of the arteries of the thetft"jjl?.n,'S'""^/^' descending part of the arch is usually directed backwards and to" ?nnn .'

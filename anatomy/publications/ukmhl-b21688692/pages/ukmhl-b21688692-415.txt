iiADIAL EEGION. 279 174.â€”Posterior Surface of Forearm. Superficial Muscles, the tlmmb. By its deep surfacG, with the elbow-joint, the Extensor carpi radialia brevior, and back part of the wrist. The Extensor Gar^n Ita- clialis Brevior is shorter, as its name implies, and thicker than the preceding muscle, beneath which it is placed. It arises from the external condyle of the humerus by a tendon common to it and the three following muscles ; from the external lateral ligament of the elbow-joint; from a strong aponeurosis which covers its surface ; and fi'om the inter- muscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles. The fibres terminate about the middle of the forearm in a flat tendon, which is closely connected with that of the pre- ceding muscle, accompanies it to the wrist lying in the same groove on the posterior surface of the radius ; passes beneath the annular ligament, and, diverging somewhat from its fellow, is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger, on its radial side. The tendons of the two pre- ceding muscles pass through the same compartment of the annular ligament, and are lubricated by a single syno- vial membrane, but are sepa- rated from each other by a small vertical ridge of bone as they lie in the groove at the back of the I'adius. Relations. By its super- iicicd surface, with the Ex- tensor carpi radialis lougior, and with the Extensor muscles of the thumb, which cross it. By its deep surface, Avith the Supinator brevis, tendon of the Pronator radii teres, radius, and wrist-joint. By its iilnar harder, with the Extensor communis digito- iTim. /

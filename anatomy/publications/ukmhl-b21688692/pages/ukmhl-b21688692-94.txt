GENERAL ANATOMY. xc The derma, or inoe sldn, is tougli, flexible, and liighly elastic, in order to defend the internal parts from violence. It consists of fibro-areolar tissue, intermixed with numerous blood-vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. The fibro-areolar tissue forms the frame-work of the cutis; it is composed of firm interlacing bundles of white fibrous tissue, intermixed with a much smaller proportion of yellow elastic fibres, the amount of which varies in different pa,rts. The fibro-areolar tissue is more abmidant in the Fig. XXXIX. -A Sectional View of the Skin (magnified). Switit 6Y(17« deeper layers of the cutis, where it is dense and firm, the meshes being larT and gradually becoming blended with the subcutaneous areolar 4sue towards the surface, the fibres become finer and more closely interlaced the most superficial layer being covered with numerous small contrv-nL eminences, the papiU.. From these differences m the structure of the cutis at different parts, it is usual to describe it a conrsting of two.layers: the deeper layer or conum, and the superficial "^TTfTowi™^^^ of strong interlacing fibrous bands, composed nf the white variety of fibrous tissue; but containing, also, some t^lM^o. elastic tissue, which vary in amount in different par^.

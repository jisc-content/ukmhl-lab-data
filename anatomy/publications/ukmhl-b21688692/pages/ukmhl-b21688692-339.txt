203 OP THE PHALANGES. ArTICULATIOKS of the M.TATAKSA. BONES WITH EACH OTHER. The W of the —al bones, except the first a^^^^ oo^^^^Zl dorsal, plantar, -f^^^^—JZ^^' Thelt -o«. ^'l- pass from one metatarsal bone to another ine j ^.ticular between the rough non-articular portions of their lateral , .surfaces are covLd with cartilage, and provided with ^.^^f^^ tinned forwards from the tarso-metatarsal joints. The digital ^^^^^^^^^ metatai-sal bones are united by the transverse metatarsal^ ligament, ^^^onr^f^ the gi-eat toe with the rest of the metatarsal bones ; m this respect it differs trom the transverse ligament in the hand. ^ ■u^„r,c ia Actians. The movement permitted in the tarsal ends of the metatarsal bones is limited to a slight ghding of the articular surfaces upon one another ; consideraDie motion, however, takes place in the digital extremities. VII. Metataeso-Phalangeal Aeticclations. The heads of the metatarsal bones are connected with the concave articular surfaces of the first phalanges by the following ligaments :— Plantar. Two Lateral. Their arrangement is precisely similar to the corresponding parts in the hand. The expansion of the Extensor tendon supplies the place of a dorsal ligament. Actions. The movements permitted in the metatarso-phalangeal articulations are flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. VIII. AeTICULATIONS of THE PHALANGES. The hgaments of these articulations are similar to those found in the hand ; each pair of phalanges being connected by a plantar and two lateral ligaments, and their articular surfaces lined by synovial membrane. Their actions are also similar.

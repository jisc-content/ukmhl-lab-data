INTERNAL PUDIC. 403 Belations. In the first part of its course, within tho polvis, it lies in front of 1,0 Pyriformis muscle and sacral plexus of nerves, and on the outer side of the .turn (on the left side). As it crosses the spine of the ischium, it :s covered Uv the Gluteus maxinms, and great sacro-sciatic ligament. In ^h^ pelvis it lies . u the outer side of the ischio-rectal fossa, upon the surface of the Obturator intornus muscle, contained in a fibrous canal formed by the obturator fascia and tl.o falciform process of the great sacro-sclatic ligament. It is accompanied by the pudic veins, and the internal pudic nerve. Pemliarities. The internal pudic is sometimes smaller than usual, or fails to give off one or two of its usual branches; in such cases, the deficiency is supplied by branches derived from an additional vessel, the accessory pudic, which generally arises from the pudic artery before its exit from the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and passes forwards near the base of the bladder, on the upper part of the prostate gland, to the perinaeum, where it gives off the branches, usually derived from the pudic artery. The deficiency most frequently met with, is that in which the internal pudic ends as the artery of the bulb; the artery of the corpus cavernosum and arteria dorsahs penis being derived from the accessory pudic. Or the pudic may terminate as the superficial perinseal, the artery of the bulb being derived, with the other two branches, from the accessory vessel. ^ The relation of the accessory pudic to the prostate gland and urethra, is of the greatest mterest in a surgical point of view, as this -yessel is in danger of being wounded in the lateral operation of lithotomy. . Branches. Within the pehis, the internal pudic gives off several small branches which supply.the muscles, sacral nerves, and pelvic viscera. In the perinceum the following branches are given ofi': i> D 2 .

The fibres are directed obliquely downwards and outwai-ds; those forming the upper and larger portion of the muscle (after con- verging somewhat) terminate in a thick tendinous lamina, which passes across the great trochanter, and is inserted into the fascia lata covering the outer side of the thigh, the lower portion of the muscle being inserted into the rough line leading ftom the great trochanter to the linea aspera between the Vastus externus and Adductor magnus. Three synovial hursce are usually found separating the under surface of this muscle from the eminences which it covers. One of these, of large size, and generally multi- locular, separates it from the great trochanter. A second, often wanting, is situated on the tuberosity of the ischium. A third is found between the tendon of this muscle and the Vastus externus. Belations. By its superficial surface, with a thin fascia, which separates it from the f]\ i\ . subcutaneous tissue. By its deep surface, from above downwards, with the ilium, sacrum, coccyx, and great sacro'sciatic ligament, part of the Gluteus mediusj Pyri- formis, Gemelli, Obturator internus, Quadra- tus femoris, the tuberosity of the ischium, great trochanter, the origin of the Biceps, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus, and Ad- ductor magnus muscles. The gluteal ves- sels and superior gluteal nerve are seen issuing from the pelvis above the Pyriformis muscle, the sciatic and internal pudic vessels and nerves, and the nerVe to the Obturator internus muscle below it. Its wpper border is thin-, and connected with the Gluteus medius by the fascia lata. Its lower harder, free and prominent, forms the fold of the nates, and is directed towards the perineum.

The Gluteus Medius is a broad, thick radiated muscle, situated on the outer surface of the pelvis Its posterior third is covered by the Gluteus maximus : its anterior two-thirds by the fascia lata, which separates it from the integument.

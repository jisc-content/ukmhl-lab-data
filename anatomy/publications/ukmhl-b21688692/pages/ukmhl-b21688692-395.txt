DIAPHRAGM. 259 of the muscular slip fi-om the ensiforra apponclix and the cartilages of the adjoining ribs, the fibres of tiie Diaphragm are deficient, tlio interval being filled by areolar tissue, covered on the thoracic side by tLe pleuiw ; on the abdominal, by the perito- neum. This is, consequently, a weak point, and a portion of the contents of the abdomen may protrude into the chest, forming phrenic or diaphragmatic hernia, or a collection of pus in the mediastinum may descend through it, so as to point at the epigastrium. Tho Ufjamcntum arcuahm intermmn is a tendinous arch, thrown across the tipper part of the Psoas magnus ipuscle, on each side of the spine. It is connected, by one end, to the outer side of the body of the first, and occasionally the second lumbar vertebra, being continuous with the outer side of the tendon of the corresponding crus; and, by the other end, to the front of the transverse process of the second lumbar vertebra. The lujamenium arcuatum externum is the thickened upper margin of the anterior lamella of the transversahs fascia; it arches across the upper part of the Quadratus lumborum, being attached, by one extremity, to the front of the transverse process of the second lumbar vertebra; and, by the other, to the apex and lower margin of the last rib. To the spine, the Diaphragm is connected by two crura, which are situated on the bodies of the lumbar vertebra3, one on each side of the aorta. The crura, at then- origin, are tendinous in structure; the right crus, larger and longer than the left, arising from the anterior surface of the bodies and intervertebral substances of the second, third, and fourth lumbar vertebra3; the left, from the second and third; both blending with the anterior common ligament of the spine. A tendinous arch is thrown across the front of the vertebral column, from the tendon of one crus to that of the other, beneath which pass the aorta, vena azygos major, and thoracic duct. ^ The tendons terminate in two large fleshy belhes, which, with the tendinous portions above alluded to, are called the crura, or pillars of the dia- phragm. The outer fasciculi of the two crura are directed upwards and outwards to the central tendon ; but the inner fasciculi decussate in front of the aorta, and then diverge, so as to surround the oesophagus before ending in the central tendon. The anterior and larger of these fasciculi is formed.by the right crus. The Central or Gordiform Tendon of the Diaphragm is a thin tendinous apo- neurosis situated at the centre of the vault formed by the muscle, immediately below the pericardmm, with which its circumference is blended. It is shaped somewhat hke a trefoil leaf, consisting of three divisions, or leaflets, separated from one another by slight indentations. The right leaflet is the largest; the middle one directed towards the ensiform cartilage, the next in size; and the left the smallest In stnicture, the tendon is composed of several planes of fibres, which intersect one another at various angles, and unite into straight or curved bundles- an arrangement which affords it additional strength smaUer aSr3 "^'^ ^'-^^^-S^ are three large and several Z l:ZJZ:.

Dr. Humphry describes such SeLencies to exist in a calvarium, in the Cambridge Museum, where a gap sufficiently late iradmit the end of the finger is seen on either side o the sagittal suture, m he Sfce of the parietal foramen. There is a specimen precise y _ similar to this in he Ceum of St. George's Hospital; and another, in which a small circular gap exists in the Sarbone of a young child, just above the parietal eminence. Similar deficiencies K no Sequently met with'in hydrocephalic skulls; being most frequent, according ?i Dr Humphry, in the frontal bones; and, in the parietal bones, on either side of the sagittal suture Pones of Face. The Facial Bones are fourteen in number, viz., the Two Nasal, Two Palate, Two Superior Maxillary, Two Inferior Turbinated, Two Lachrymal, Vomer, Two Malar, - Inferior Maxillary. Nasal Bones. The Nasal are two small oblong bones, varying in size and form in different individuals ; they are placed side by side at the middle and upper part of the face, forming, by their junction, ' the bridge' of the nose. Each bone presents for examination two surfaces, and four bor- ders. The outer surface is concave from above downwards, convex from side to side ; it is covered by the Py- ramidalis and Com- pressor nasi muscles, marked by numerous small arterial furrows, and perforated about its centre by a foramen, Xitner Surfime sometimes double, for the transmission of a small vein. Sometimes this foramen is absent on one or both sides, and occasionally the foramen coecum opens on this surface. The imicr sur- face is concave from side to side, convex from above downwaWs ; in which direction it is traversed by a longitudinal groove (sometimes a canal), for the passage of a 43.—Right Nasal Bone. vv ■unt/i -Ojipoaitc Iviic. 44.—Eight Nasal Bone.

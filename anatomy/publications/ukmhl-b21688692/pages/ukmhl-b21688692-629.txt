It is usually covered in and concealed by the amygdalae, and cannot be seen until they are drawn aside. This band is of a semilunar form on each side, its anterior margin being free and concave, its posterior attached just in front of the furrowed band. Between it and the nodulua and uvula behind, is a deep fossa, called the siuallow's nest (nidus hirundinis). Loles of the cerebellum. Each hemisphere is divided into an upper and a lower portion by the great horizontal fissure, which commences in front at the pons, and passes horizontally round the free margin of either hemisphere, backwards to the middle line. From this primary fissure numerous secondary fissures proceed, which separate the cerebellum into lobes. Upon the upper surface of either hemisphere there are two lobes, separated from each other by a fissure. These are the anterior or square lobe, which extends as far back as the posterior edge of the vermiform process, and the posterior or semilunar lobe, which passes from the termination of the preceding to the great liorizontal fissure. Upon the under surface of either hemisphere there are five lobes, separated by sulci ; these are from before backwards ; the flocculus or sub-pedimcular lobe, a prominent taft, situated behind and below the middle peduncle of the cerebellum; its surface is composed of grey matter, subdivided into a few small laminre : it is sometimes called the pneumogastrio lobule, from being situated behind the'pneumo- gastric nerve. The amygdala or tonsil is situated on either side of the great median

Its anterior margin is smooth and ^^^^^^f^!^^^^^^^^^ circumference of the orbit. Its superior mar-gm, rough, and d-e^^d hon^ntally articulates with the frontal bone behmd the external angular process. Its posterior margin is rough and serrated for articulation with 49—Left Malar Bone. Outer Surface, the sphenoid; internally it is also serrated for articulation with the orbital surface of the superior maxillary. At the angle of junction of the sphe- noidal and maxillary portions, a short rounded non-articular margin is generally seen: this forms the anterior boundary of the spheno-maxillary fissure ; occasionally, no such non-arti- cular margin exists, the fissure being completed by the direct junction of the maxillary and sphenoid bones, or by the inter- position of a small Wormian bone in the angular interval be- tween them. On the upper sur- face of the orbital process are seen the orifices of one or two temporo-malar canals; one of these usually opens on the pos- terior surface, the other (occa- sionally two), on the facial surface: they transmit filaments (temporo-malar) of the orbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve. The maxillary process is a rough triangular surface, which articulates with the supe- rior maxillary bone. The zygo- wafa'c process, long, narrow, and serrated, articulates with the zygomatic process of the tem- poral bone. 0/ four hor- ders, the superior or orbital is Tn^LbT pfr^ oTthf ^^^^^^ of the orbit.

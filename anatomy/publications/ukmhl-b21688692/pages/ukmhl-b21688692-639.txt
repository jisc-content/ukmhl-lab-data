As tne primary brL^hL'andTheir fffsets diverge from each other, they present somewhat the appearance of a bird's claws; hence the name of pes ansermus is given to the divisions of the facial nerve in and near the parotid gland. The communications of the facial nerve may be thus arranged :— In the internal auditory meatus, . With the auditory nerve. fWith Meckel's ganglion by the large In the aquffiductus Fallopii .

Opposite the hiatus Fallopii, the gamgliform enlargement on the facial nerve communicates by means of the large petrosal nerve, witb Meckel's ganglion, forming its motor root; by a filament from, the small petrosal, with the otic ganglion; and by the external petrosal, with the sympathetic filaments accom- panying the middle meningeal artery (Bidder). From the ganghform enlarge- ment, accordi^ng to Arnold, a twig is sent back to the auditory nerve. At its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen, it sends a twig to the pneumogastnc, another to the gbsso-pharyngeal nerve, and communicates with the carotid plexus of the sympathetic, with the great auricular branch of the cervical plexus, with the auricnlo-temporal branch of the inferior-maxillary nerve in the parotid gland, and on the face-with the terminal branches of the three divisions-of the fifth.

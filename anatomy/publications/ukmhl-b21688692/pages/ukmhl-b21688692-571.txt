SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. 435 The opUhalmic is a large vein, wliicli connects the frontal vein at the inner angle of the orbit with the cavernous sinus ; it pursues the same course as the ophthalmic artery, and receives branches corresponding to those derived from that vessel. Forming a short single trunk, it passes through the inner extremity ot the sphenoidal fissure, and terminates in the cavernous sinus, 239.—The Sinuses at the Base of the Skull. 0j3£'ning of* jiTas^oid Vein The Circular Sinus completely surrounds the pituitary body, and communicates on each side with the cavernous sinuses. Its posterior half is larger than the anterior ; and in old age it is more capacious than at an early period of life. It receives veins from the pituitary body, and from the adjacent bone and dura mater. The Inferior Petrosal Sinus is situated in the groove formed by the junction of the inferior border of the petrous portion of the temporal with the basilar process of the occipital. It commences in front at the termination of the cavernous sinus, and opens behind into the jugular foramen, forming with the lateral sinus the commencement of the internal jugular vein. These sinuses are semi-cylindrical in form. The Transverse Sinus is placed transversely across the fore part of the basilar process of the occipital bone serving to connect the two inferior petrosal and cavernous sinuses. A second is occasionally found opposite the foramen magnum. The Stiperior Petrosal Sinus is situated along the upper border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, in the front part of the attached margin of the ten- torium. It is small and narrow, and connects together the cavernous and lateral sinuses at each side. It receives a cerebral vein (inferior lateral cerebral) from the under part of the middle lobe, a cerebellar vein (anterior lateral cerebellar) from the anterior border of the cerebellum, and a vein from the internal eai-. r r 2

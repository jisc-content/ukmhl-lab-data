The inferior division of this surface is concave, rough and uneven, and perforated by numerous small foramina for the passage of nutrient vessels. _ j „ The Antrum oimglimore, or Maxillary Sinus, is a large tria*gular-shaped cavity, hollowed out of the body of the maxillary bone; its apex, du-ected outwards, is formed by the malar pn)cess ; its base, by the outer waU of the nose Its walls are everywhere exceedingly thin, its root being formed by the orbital plate its floor by the alveolar process, its anterior wall by the facial, and its posterior by the zygo- mLc si^itce Its inner wall, or base, presents, in the disarticulated bone, a laxge SrerulaTapert^^^ which communicates with the nasal fossa.

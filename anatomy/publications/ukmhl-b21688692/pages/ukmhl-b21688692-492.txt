356 AilTKUiKS. Pcculiarilics. The lachrymal artery is sometimes derived from one of the anterior branches of the middle meuingeal artery. The mpraorhUal artery, the largest branch of the ophthalmic, arises from that vessel above the optic nerve. Ascending so as to rise above all the_ muscles of the orbit it passes forwards, with the frontal nerve, between the periosteum and Levator palpebrffi; and passing through the supraorbital foramen, divides into a superficial and deep branch, which supply the muscles and integument of the forehead and pericranium, anastomosing with the temporal, the angular branch of the facial, and the artery of the opposite side. This artery in the orbit supplies the Superior rectus and the Levator palpebra3, sends a branch inwards, across the , pulley of the Superior obhque muscle, to supply the parts at the inner canthus, and, at the supraorbital foramen, frequently transmits a branch to the diploe. The ethmoidal hravches are two in number; posterior and anterior. The former, which is the smaller, passes through the posterior ethmoidal foramen, supplies the posterior ethmoidal cells, and entering the cranium, gives off a meningeal branch, which supplies the adjacent dui-a mater, and nasal branches which^'desccnd into the nose through apertures in the cribriform plate, anasto- mosiuo- with branches of the spheno-palatine. The anterior ethmoidal artery accompanies the nasal nerve through the anterior ethmoidal foramen, supplies the anterior ethmoidal cells and frontal sinuses, and, entering the cramum, divides into a meningeal branch, which supplies the adjacent dura mater, and a nasal branch which descends into the nose, through an aperture m the cribriform plate The palpebral arteries, two in number, superior and inferior, anse from the ophthalmic, opposite the pulley of the Superior oblique muscle; they encircle the evelids near their free margin, forming a superior and an inferior arch, which lie between the orbicularis muscle and tarsal cartilages; the superior palpebral inosculating at the outer angle of the orbit with the orbital branch of the temporal artery, the inferior palpebral with the orbital branch of the mfra- orbital artery, at tho inner side of the lid. From this anastomosis a branch passes to the nasal duct, ramifying in its mucous membrane, as far as the inferior ""'The frmtal artery, one of the terminal branches of the ophthalmic, passes from the orbi( at its inner angle, and ascending on the forehead, supplies the muscles, integument, and pericranium, anastomosing with the supraorbital arteiy. The r^aU aLy, the other terndnal branch of the ophthahnac, emerges from the orbit above the tendo oculi, and, after giving a branch to the lachrymal sac. divides into twp, one of which anastomoses with the angular artery, the other Wch, the dor;alis nasi, runs along the dorsum of the nose, supplies its entu-e surface and anastomoses with the artery of the opposite side. ■, . • .

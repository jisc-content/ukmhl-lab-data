CRANIAL NERVES. 504 The Tyvipanio branch arises from the nerve opposite the pyramid ; it is a small filament, which suiiplios the Staptidius and Laxator tympani muscles. The Ghorda tymjoani is given o(l' I'rom the facial as it passes vertically down- wards at the back of tlio tympanum, about a quarter of an inch before its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen. It ascends from below upwards in a distinct canal, parallel with the aqurocluctns Fallopii, and enters the cavity of the tym- panum through an opening (iter chordoj posterius) between the base of the pyramid and the attachment of the membrana tympani, and becomes invested 275â€”The Nerves of the Scalp, Face, nnd Side of the Neck. with mucous membrane. It passes forwards through the cavity of the tympanum, between the handle of the malleus and vertical ramus of the incus, to its anterior inferior angle, and emerges from that cavity through a foramen at the inner side of the Glaserian fissure which is called the iter chordas anterius, or canal of Huguier. It then descends between the two Pterygoid muscles, and meets the gustatory nerve at an acnte angle, after communicating with which, it accompanies it to the submaxillary gland ; it then joins the submaxillary ganglion, and termi- nates in the Lingualis muscle. The Posterior av/ricular nerve ai'ises close to the stylo-mastoid foramen, and passes upwards in front of the mastoid process, where it is joined by a filament from the auricular branch of the pneumogastric, and communicates with the deep

ARTICULATIONS. 188 The arrangement of those hgaments is similar to those in the metacarpo-pha- langeal articulations ; the extensor tendon supplies the place of a posterior ^'^TSls. The only movements permitted in the phalangeal joints are flexion and extension ; those movements are more extensive between the first and second phalanges than between the second and third. The movement of flexion is very considerable, but the extension is limited by the anterior and lateral ligaments. ARTICULATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The articulations of the Lower Extremity comprise the following groups:—!. The hin ioint II. The knee-joint. III. The articulations between the tibia nnd fibuH IV The ankle-joint. V. The articulations of the tarsus. VL The tarso-metatarsai articulations. VII. The metatarso-phalangeal articulations. VIII. The articulations of the phalanges. 138.—Left Ilip-Joint laid open.

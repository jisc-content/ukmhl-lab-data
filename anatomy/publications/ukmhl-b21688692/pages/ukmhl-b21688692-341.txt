The relations, also, of some of the â„¢f^'^'^^^^^^^ they immediate apposition with the larger blood-vessels, and the Tf^^^'."^^^^^^^ produce, should be especially remembered, as they form useful guides in the ap plication of a ligature to those vessels. . . , .1, j fhiVk Tendons are white, glistening, fibrous cords, varying m ^^^S^^;^/^"^^^^^^ ness, sometimes round, sometimes flattened, of considerable strength, slightly elastic. They consist almost entirely of ^^^^^^^ fibrous of which have an undulating course parallel with each other and are S^^l^ ^^^^^^^^^ together. They are very sparingly supplied with blood-vessels, the smaller tendons presenting in their interior not a trace of them. Nerves also are not present in the smaller tendons ; but the larger ones, as the tendo AchiUis, receive nerves which accompany the nutrient vessels. The tendons consist prmcipally ot a substance which yields gelatine. _ Aponeuroses are fibrous membranes, of a pearly-white colour, iridescent, glistening, and similar in structure to the tendons. They are destitute of nerves, and the thicker ones only sparingly supplied with blood-vessels. The tendons and aponeuroses are connected, on the one hand, with the muscles; and on the other hand, with the moveable structures, as the bones, cartilages, ligaments, fibrous membranes (for instance, the sclerotic), and the synovial mem- branes (subcrur^eus, subanconeus). Where the muscular fibres are in a direct line with those of the tendon or aponeurosis, the two are directly continuous, the muscular fibre being distinguishable from that of the tendon only by its striation. But where the muscular fibre joins the tendon or aponeurosis at an obhque_ angle, the former terminates, according to KoUiker, in rounded extremities, which are received into corresponding depressions on the surface of the latter, the connective tissue between the fibres being continuous with that of the tendon. The latter mode of attachment occurs in all the penniform and bipenniform muscles, and m those muscles the tendons of which commence in a membranous form, as the Gastrocnemius and Soleus. The fascise (fascia, a bandage) are fibro-areolar or aponeurotic laminse, of variable thickness and strength, found in all regions of the body, investing the softer and more dehcate organs. The fasciae have been subdivided, from the structure which they present, into two groups, fibro-areolar or superficial fascia, and aponeurotic or deep fasciae. The fihro-areolar fascia is found immediately beneath the integument over almost the entire surface of the body, and is generally known as the superficial fascia. It connects the skin with the deep or aponeurotic fascia, and consists of fibro-areolar tissue, containing in its meshes pellicles of fat in varying quantity. In the eyelids and scrotum, where adipose tissue is rarely deposited, this tissue is very Hable to serous infiltration. The superficial fascia varies in thickness in differ- ent parts of the body: in the groin it is so thick as to be capable of being subdi- vided into several laminae, but in the palm of the hand it is of extreme thinness, and intimately adherent to the integument. The superficial fascia is capable of separa- tion into two or more layers, between which are found the superficial vessels and nerves, and superficial lymphatic glands ; as the superficial epigastric vessels in the abdominal region, the radial and ulnar veins in the forearm, the saphenous veins m the leg and thigh; certain cutaneous muscles also are situated in the superficial fascia, as the Platysma myoides in the neck, and the Orbicularis palpebrarum around the eyelids. This fascia is most distinct at the lower part of the abdomen, the scro- tum, perincoum, and extremities; is very thin in those regions where muscular

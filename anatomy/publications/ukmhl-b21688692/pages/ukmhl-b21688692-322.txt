Occasionally, the articulation of the unciform with the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones has a separate synovial membrane. , , . . The Synovial Membranes of the wnst (hg. 136) are thus seen to be five in T^fi —Vertical S-ctioa through the Articulations at tho Wrist, showing the Five Synovial Membranes, number. The first, the membrana sacciformis, lines the lower end of tte nlna the sigmoid cavity oi the radius, and upper surface of the triangular -terarticular fibro-fartilage. The second lines the lower end of the radius and -ter-ticrd^ fibro.cartila|e above, and the scaphoid, semilunar, and f^-^^^^^^^^f^^^^^^^^^ The Mrd, the most extensive, covers the contiguous sui-faces of the two rows of carpal bones and, passing between the bones of the second row Imes the carpal eZmitr of tbLlur iLer metacarpal bones.

o GENERAL ANATOMY. analogous to the derma of the skin; and is in fact continuous with it at the orifices of the body. The corium consists, as it is usually described, of a transparent structureless basement-membrane next to the epithelium, supported by a fibro-vascular layer of variable thickness below it, and this merging into the sub-mucous areolar tissue. It is only in some situations that the basement-membrane can be demonstrated. The fibro-vascular layer of the corium contains, besides the white and yellow fibrous tissue and the vessels, muscular fibre-cells, nerves, and lymphatics, in various proportions. Embedded in it are found numerous glands and projecting out of it are processes (villi and papilhcc) analogous to the' papilla of the skin. These glands and processes, however, exist only at certain parts, and it will be more convenient to refer for their description to the sequel, where the parts are described in which they occur Thus the mucous glands are described in the account of the mouth, the stomach, the intestines, &c., the papilla and vilH with that of the tongue. . , , x .i i- The synovial membranes are analogous m structure to the serous, but differ from them in the nature of their secretion, which rather resembles mucus. They are described on p. 146. SECRETING GLANDS. The secreting glands are organs in which the blood ckculating in capil- lary vessels is brought into contact with the epitheHal cells of a mucous membrane, whereby certain elements are separated ('secreted ) out of the blood, and are poured into the mucous cavity. This cavity is arranged m the form of a ramifying duct, the secreting cells lymg m, or touching the terminal ramifications (or more correctly the commencing radicles) of the ^""tn size the glands vary extremely: thus the liver weighs nearly four pounds, while many of the mucous glands are only visible to the naked eye when distended wiJh secretion: and they vary not less m struc ure. Thus the sti'ucture of the liver is so complex that it can hardly y^t be regarded as known with absolute certainty, while there are a great many glands which consist either of a single tube lined with epi helium, on the outer Tide of which the blood circulates, or even a simple closed sac which opens when it becomes charged with secretion. , •. n .

It consists of two parts, a prmcipal cavity, or smus, ana n auriculsa. ..s.-The Eight Auricle and Ventricle laid open, the Anterior Walls of both being leuiovecl. BrhtUi 'paKftcd through Sight Auricula-Vcittrieuloj' cjtenifi^ The sinus is the large quadrangular cavity, placed between the two venas cavjB : its walls are extremely thin: it is connected below with the right ventricle, and internally with the left auricle, being free in the rest of its extent. The appendiic auriciilce, so called from its fancied resemblance to a dog's ear, is a small conical muscular porch, the margins of which present a dentated edge. It projects from the sinus forwards and to the left side, overlapping the root of the pulmonary artery. To examine the interior of the auricle, a transverse incision should be made along its ventricular margin, from its right border to the appendix; and from the middle of this, a second incision should be earned upwards, along the inner side of the two vena3 cavse. The following parts present themselves for examination :— Superior cava. Inferior cava. , Openings. " Coronary Sinus. Valves. \ Foramina Thebesii. ■ Auriculo-ventricular. Relics of footal f Annulus ovalis, structure. \ Fossa ovalis. Musculi pectinati. Eustachian. Coronary.

ARTERIES. 348 supplies the structures composing the chin, and anastomoses with the submental, interior labial, and iiiTci-ior coronary D-rtorios. As the dental artery enters the foramen, it gives olF a niylo-liyoid branch, which runs in the Mylo-hyoid groove, and ramilics on the under surface of the Mylo-hyoid muscle. The dental and incisor arteries during their course through the suljstance of the bone give off a few twio-s which arc lost in the cancellous tissue, and a series of branches which correspond in number to the roots of the teeth : these enter the minute apertures at the extremities of the fangs, and supply the pulp of the teeth. BUANCUES OF TUB SECOND, OR P'fERYGOID PORTION. Deep Temporal. Masseteric. Pterygoid. Buccal. These branches are distributed, as their names imply, to the muscles in the maxillary region. The deep temporal hranches, two in number, anterior and posterior, each occupy that part of the temporal fossa indicated by its name. Ascending between the temporal muscle and pericranium, they supply that muscle, and anastomose with the other temporal arteries ; the anterior branch communicating with the lachrymal through small branches which perforate the malar bone, and great wing of the sphenoid. The pterygoid Iranches, irregular in their number and origm, supply the Pterygoid muscles. . ., The masseteric is a small branch which passes outwards above the sigmoid notch of the lower jaw, to the deep surface of the Masseter. It supplies that muscle, and anastomoses with the masseteric branches of the facial and with the transverse facial artery. .r. t i i The luccal: is a small branch which runs obliquely forwards between the internal pterygoid and the ramus of the jaw, to the outer surface of the Buccinator, to which it is distributed, anastomosing with branches of the facial artery. Brancbes of the Third, or Spheno-Maxillary Portion. Alveolar. Yi^i^Tx. Infraorbital. Pterygo-Palatme. Posterior or Descending Palatine. Nasal or Spheno-Palatine. The alvedar i^ given oft" from the internal maxillary by a common brauch with the infraorbital, and just as the trunk of the vessel is passmg mto the spheno- maxillary fossa. Descending upon the tuberosity of the supei.or --^Ua^^--' it divides into numerous branches ; one, the superior dental, larger than the rest, supplies the molar and bicuspid teeth, its bra^iches. entering the foramina in the alveolar process; some branches pierce the bone to. supply the lining of the . antrum, and others are continued forwards on the alveolar process to supply the ^"'he mfraorlital appears, from its direction, to be the continuation of the trunk of the internal maxillary. It arises from that vessel by a common trunk with the precedinc. branch, and runs along the infraorbital canal with the superior IxU aiy nerve, emerging upon the face at the .f ~'^^^^ Levator labii superioris-. Whilst contained in the canal, it g-^/ «^ ^^^^^^^^ which ascend into the orbit, and supply the Infenor ^^^^^^^^^J^f ^^^^^i^^^," muscles, and the lachrymal gland. Other branches descend through canals in e W, to supply the mucous membrane of the antrum, and the ^'-^ te th of e upper jaw' On the face, it supplies the lachrymal sac, and ™ ^^^^^^^^^^^^ o?bit anastomosing with the facial artery and nasal branch of ^P^^f'^"^' and other branches descend beneath the Levator labii superions. and anastomose with the transverse facial and buccal branches. „ , . , i -iio^n- The four remaining branches arise from that portion of the mternal maxillary which is contained in the sphcno-maxillary fossa.

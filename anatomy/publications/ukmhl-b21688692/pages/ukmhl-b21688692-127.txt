DEVELOPMENT OP THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. cxxiii Tlie termination of each cardinal vein above, in the sinus of Cuvier, or superior cava, also persists. The central atrophied portion of the cardinal veins is replaced by a vein on either side, called posterior vertebral, which receive the intercostal and lumbar veins, and are soon united by an oblique anastomosing branch. The right vertebral vein, together with the persistent termination of the right cardinal vein, forms the great azygos vein. The distal portion of the lefb vertebral vein with the obhque anas- tomosing branch, forms the small azygos; and the upper part of the left vei-tebral, with the persistent termination of the left cardinal, forms the left superior intercostal vein. The 'foetal circulation' is spoken of at p. 663. Development of the alimentary canal. The development of the intestinal cavity is, as shown above, p. cxi., one of the earliest phenomena of embryonic life. This original intestine is closed at either end, and is at first in free communication with the umbilical vesicle (Fig. LIV., 3). It is divided into three parts: the anterior or cephalic portion of the primi- tive intestine, the middle, and the posterior or pelvic. From the first is Fig. LXL—^Diagram of the formation of the main systemic veins.

The buccal cavity on the one hand, and the lower portion of the rectum on the other, are separate pro- ductions from the external layer of the blastodermic membrane, and do

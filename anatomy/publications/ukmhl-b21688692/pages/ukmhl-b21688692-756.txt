ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 620 upon the intenial surface of the parietes of those cavities, forming tlie pai-ietal layer. The free surface of the peritoneum is smooth, moist, and covered by a thin squamous epitheliiun ; its attached surface is rough, being connected to the viscera and inner surface of the pariotes by means of areolar tissue, called the suhperiionaal areolar tissue. The parietal portion is loosely connected with the fascia lining the abdomen and pelvis ; but more closely to the under surface of the Diaphragm, and in the middle line of the abdomen. In order to trace the reflections of this membrane (fig. 332), the abdomen having been opened, the liver should be raised and supported in that position, and the stomach should be depressed, when a thin membranous layer is seen passing 332.â€”The Eeiiections of the Peritoneum, as seen in a vertical Secti(m of the Abdomen. J^atars tfiiwft/A from the transverse fissure of the liver to the upper border of the stomach : this Is the lesser or gastro-liepatic omentum. It consists of two delicate layers of peri- toneum, an anterior and a posterior, between which are continued the hepatic vessels and nerves. Of these two layers, the anterior should first be traced, and then the posterior. ^ ^ 1. j The anterior layer descends to the lesser curvature of the stomach, and covers its anterior surface as far as the great curvature; it descends for some distance in front of the small intestines, and, returning upon itself to the transverse colon, forms the external layer of the great omentum; it then covers the under surface of the transverse colon, and, passing to the back part of the abdonimal cavity, forms the inferior layer of the transverse meso-colon. It then descends m front ot the duodenum, the aorta, and vena cava, as far as the superior mesenteric arterj- along which it passes to invest the small intestines, and, returmng to the vertebral

Its suporfidal surface is subcutaneous, excepting at its upper part, where it is covered by tho Trapezius. By its deep surface, it is m relation with tho Erector spinco, the Serratus posticus inferior, the lower latercostal muscles and ribs the Serratus maguus, inferior angle of the scapula, Rhomboideus major, Infraspinatus, and Teres major. Its outer margin is separated below, from the External obhque by a small triangular interval; and another triangular interval exists between its upper border and the margin of the Trapezius, in which the Intercostal and Rhomboideus major muscles are exposed.

The Trapezius must be removed in order to expose the next layer; to effect this, detach the muscle from its attachment to the clavicle and spine of the scapula, and turn it back towards the spine. The Levator Anguli Scapulae is situated at the back paf t and side of the neck. It arises by four tendinous slips from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the three or four upper cervical vertebras; these becoming fleshy are united so as to form a flat muscle, which, passing downwards and backwards, is inserted into the posterior border of the scapula, between the superior angle and the triangular smooth surface at the root of the spine. _ , m • EelaUons.

24 carefully dissected five dead bodies should be produced, before the granting of any diploma in medicine or sur- gery. Supposing the number of students in London to be 400, the number of dead bodies required annually in the metropolis would be 600. Add dead bodies for 200 students at Edinburgh, 200 at Dublin, anft 100 at Glas- gow, the total number of .dead bodies required annually in the empire for preliminary anatomical instruction, would be 1350, to which must still be added 300 dead bodies annually, for the repetition of surgical operations, making a total of 1650 dead bodies annually, for the use of students alone. Supposing farther that there are 30 teachers of anatomy in the empire, each of them will re- quire for his public demonstrations, on an average, 10 dead bodies annually, making an addition of 300, or a total of 1950. By the dedication then of 2000 dead bo- dies annually to the purposes of anatomy, the health and happiness of twenty-one millions of men may be very materially promoted. And though from the novelty of such a calculation, the number of dead bodies here stat- ed may sound as if immense, yet when compared with an annual mortality of 500,000, it will appear as almost nothing.* Nor will the hospitals, infirmaries, work-houses, poor- * The above calculation, along with the following plan, and most of the reasonings in the preceding pages, I published in 1820, in the Quarterly Journal of Foreign Medicine and Surgery.

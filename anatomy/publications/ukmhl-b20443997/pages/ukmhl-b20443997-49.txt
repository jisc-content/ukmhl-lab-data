7 OF THE USE OF CHLORATE OF SODA AND CHLORATE OF LIME, The discredit which deservedly accompanies those who abuse public credulity, by extolling, through the medium of the Press, some wonderful Nostrum, pre- vented me from publishing my first experiments on the medicinal use of the Chlorates, at the time when they were instituted, notwithstanding the most satisfactory results. I limited myself, therefore, in the execution of my wishes : communicating my experience merely verbally or by writing to the most eminent men in the profession. This not being considered sufficiently ex- plicit, added to the interest excited by the constant success of my experiments, I became solicited on all sides for information on the use of the Chlorates, and was therefore, under the necessity of giving some in- struction on the manner of using them: this instruction subsequently became indispensable to the employment of these powerful antiseptics in the Antilles, and other parts so frequently desolated by serious and contagious affections.

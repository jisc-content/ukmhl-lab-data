14 effects upon this frightful malady as well as upon Her- pes ulceratia, continue to be experienced. Observations on the cure of Porrigo favosa have also been communi- cated to the Royal Academy of Medicine. In fine, we may deduce from all that has been ob- served on the use of the Chlorate of Soda upon man, that this liquid is capable of removing the fcetor of sores, of changing their nature, and making them pass into a state of simple ulceration. That it is, above all, effi- cacious in atonic ulcers, hospital gangrene, mortifica- tion, &c. &c. It is used pure, or mixed with one, two, or as far as eight parts of water in the form of lotion, and care should be taken that the wounds are covered with lint moistened with this liquid. The dressing should be removed twice a day, and its use suspended when the sore becomes red and inflamed. The applica- tions then necessary, being such as are usually directed in Surgical books. For ulcers of the uterus the Chlorate of Soda should be diluted with twelve or fifteen or even thirty times its weight of pure water, and used as an injection. Pru- dence recommends that its use should be directed by a professional man, who will increase or moderate its action, or even suspend it if requisite. The Chlorate of Soda is that which I have used on with lint. The fungoid granulations were cauterised with a solu- tion of Nitrate of silver; the Chloiate was again resorted to about the 14th day, and on the 18th nothing remained but small ul- cerated points. The patient recovered his appetite and was able in walk with crutches, his strength gradually returned, and he is at this time radically cured."

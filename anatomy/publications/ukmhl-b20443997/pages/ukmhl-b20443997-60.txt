10 successful experiments, that the solutions of the Chlo- rates of Lime and of Soda, mixed with water, may be employed with economy and facility for speedily des- troying the infectious effluvia of animal matter used by catgut makers, and of bodies in a state of putrefaction, and for purifying places where the air is corrupted. On certain Uses of the Chlorate of Soda.* After reading the prec^aTng observations, every judi- cious practitioner will perceive in what cases the appli- cation of the Chlorate of Soda may be expected to be successful, and determine the degree of credit to which the inventor is intitled, by ascertaining the disorders which claim its use. It would be fastidious to name all the celebrated Physicians and Surgeons who have studied the action of the Alkaline and Earthy Chlorates, but I cannot dispense with shewing my gratitude to those friends of humanity, M. Biett, Physician of St. Louis, for his numerous applications upon Herpetic eruptions; to M. Jules Cloquet, Chief Surgeon of the same hos- pital, for his applications to gangrenous ulcers. In many of these formidable affections, the skilful surgeon bathed the mortified limb in the Chlorate, diluted with 10 or 15 parts of water, and directed from 25 to 30 drops of the Chlorate of Soda, to be taken in a pint of " Tisane." His observations will be published. * The Formula for the preparation of the Chlorate of Soda which I published in my Memoir, should be followed exactly, for if not strictly adhered to, the properties are so changed, that the prepa- ration may be good for nothing; but if the Chlorate be properly prepared, the effects related in this paper are always certain of being obtained.

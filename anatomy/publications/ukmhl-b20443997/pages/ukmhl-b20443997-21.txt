13 unless the scholar had actual opportunities of work- ing, and of educating his hands to his business, by re- peated trials upon the materials of his trade, his pro- ductions would be clumsy and imperfect. And shall we expect one of the most difficult of all the arts to be at- tainable without the like opportunities of practical im- provement? Shall those who are to practise the most important of all the arts, be left to follow a plan of edu- cation so palpably imperfect? Many of the common arts are extremely difficult to be acquired: yet all of them are founded upon the laws of the phenomena of inanimate matter. Surgery, on the other hand, whilst its operations are partly founded on these laws, and are attended by the same kind oT diffi- culties as those of the common arts, presents a new set of difficulties, the nature and the amount of which are scarcely at all appreciable by any other than the surgeon himself. These new difficulties arise from this, that surgery is founded not only on the' laws which regulate the phenomena of inanimate matter, but also on the peculiar laws of organized or living bodies. How easy would it be to cut down upon an artery, were not cau- tion forced upon the surgeon, by the consideration, that it is with a tube conveying a tide of living blood that he has to do, and that if in exposing that tube, he cuts across a muscle, or divides any considerable nerve, he may leave his patient lame for life; or if unwarily he opens the tube itself, in a few seconds his patient may expire from loss of blood!

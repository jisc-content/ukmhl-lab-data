23 plied at a reasonable rate, without having longer to en- counter the perplexities, dangers, and insufficiencies, under which they have laboured for so great a length of time. Before proceeding to explain the only public measure which appears capable of answering this important ob- ject, it may be proper to state, in a general way, the number of dead bodies which would be annually re- quired for the practical teaching of anatomy, in Great Britain and Ireland. I shall suppose the period of study to be three years, and that in each of these years, a careful dissection is to be made of all the most important parts of the body. This will require one dead body for the muscles, a second for the blood-vessels, and a third for the nerves. The viscera may be studied partly in one, and partly in the other two of these three dead bodies. Now, in the course of three years, two students will require nine dead bodies, to which we shall add a tenth for the repetition of the prin- cipal surgical operations. Such I consider as the most moderate computation which ought to be admitted; al- though it cannot be denied, that comparatively few surgeons of the present day, have enjoyed opportu- nities of carrying their anatomical studies even to the length here proposed. Double the number of dead bodies I have here stated would, I think, be little enough for the acquirement even of a moderate knowledge of anatomy; but, at least, evidence of the student's having

8 hears the frightful cries of his victim, and sometimes sees him expire under hand. The error he has commit- ted is irretrievable; he has destroyed a fellow-creature. â€¢ it t It is true that a living ieirig and a mere mechanical engine are not e^ try upon a par; and that a medical practitioner may sometimes seem to set the one to rights, although he knows little of its structure,- while any at- tempt to mend the other by a person who had not pre- viously taken the engine to pieces, and examined its several parts, would be at once pronounced a proof of folly and presumption. That a medical practitioner may sometimes contribute to rectify a disorder, although, from his ignorance of anatomy, he may not be able to tell what part of the body appears to be affected, and much less what is the intimate structure of that part, and what its relations to the parts around it, is a fact which depends entirely on the constant tendency in diseased nature to restore itself. This constitutes a striking difference between a disordered living body and a disordered mechanical engine; and upon this differ- ence, is built the different success which occasionally at- tends the medical practitioner ignorant of anatomy, and the artist who should pretend to mend a machine, the structure of which he had never studied. Such an artist men would treat at once as a knave; but so unreflecting is the world, that such a medical practitioner is still treated as honest, and is even not unfrequently regarded, by those who happen from the excellence of their con- stitution to escape out of his hands alive, as a man of no inconsiderable skill.

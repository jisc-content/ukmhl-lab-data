31 at the beginning of the year 1824, to M. Keraudren, In- spector general of the Health of Seamen, who, at this time, was charged by the Minister of Marine, to make a report of my propositions, the subject of which was the purification of his Majesty's Navy, propositions which were adopted, and which I shall make known elsewhere. Dr. Marc, member of the Royal Academy of Medicine, who in 1823, was appointed by the Council of Health to assist at my experiments on Animal matter, Water Closets, &c. and was one of the first who saw the whole, of the applications, desired much to be present at this experiment of disinfecting water. The Chlorate of Lime is previously dissolved in water, and added, a little at a time, stirring the impure water until the disinfection is complete. If the Chlorate predominates it is merely necessary to expose the water, thus purified, for a few minutes to the air, and then filter it or let it subside, when it is potable. It may easily be con- ceived of what utility this process must be* either at Sea or in marshy Countries where the water is unwholesome, or in places where persons are reduced to the necesity of drinking water from Cisterns, which is frequently impure. I could multiply examples without end, either in narrating facts of the medicinal applications of the Chlorates observed in France and in the Colonies, or in reporting authentic operations amongst ourselves; also that which was performed at St. Domingo by order of the Government of that Country the proceedings of which were inserted in the official gazette of the 20th February 1825; but this would be leading me beyond the limits allowed for this treatise, which 1 consider as the mere Epitome of a more extended work, in which I shall endeavour to show the causes and Phenomena of putre-

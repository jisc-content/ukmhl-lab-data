14 It must be evident, that it would be a very great ad- vantage in acquiring a knowledge of operative surgery, if its peculiar difficulties could be set aside for a time, and a certain practice and dexterity acquired, without having the dangers and the complication of obstacles to encounter, which meet the surgeon when he attempts the exercise of this art upon moving and sensible matter. This great advantage can be gained, only by repeating the operations of surgery on the dead subject. If oppor- tunities were permitted for doing so, the performance of every operation once upon the dead body, before at- tempting it on the living, could be regarded as no more than a pitiful precaution against the self-accusation which would rise in the surgeon's mind, when he considered, that to do upon the living, what he had not previously tried upon the dead, must be unjustifiable temerity and cruelty. Yet to repeat the chief operations of surgery even once on the dead body, is what has fallen to the lot of comparatively few who have become surgeons in this country for many years back, and is at present still more than ever beyond reach. i$ To derive improvement from exercises of this kind, they would require to be repeated frequently and metho- dically. The parts to be operated on, ought first of all to be dissected on one subject, or on one side of the body, then the operation ought to be performed on an- other subject, or on the other side, and lastly, the parts operated upon ought to be dissected, that the faults

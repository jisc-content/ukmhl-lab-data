22 into three gallons of water; a linen cloth is to be dipped into this mixture and the corpse covered with it, the same liquid being frequently carefully sprinkled over it during the time it is watched. The necessity for this operation is daily perceived at Paris, and considerably more so in hot climates. Also professional men, when examining or embalming dead bodies, preserve them- selves from all unwholesome emanation, by using the Chlorate in the manner just described.* The Chlorate of Soda diluted in 25 or 30 parts of water, has been employed with success in disinfecting and preserving subjects in dissecting rooms; this opera- tion is performed by means of a tin watering pot con- taining about six quarts, which is to be filled with Chlorated water ; the foetid body is to be sprinkled twice a day, and the surface afterwards brushed and washed with clear water. The moment the chemical preparation comes in contact with the body, the effluvium is des- troyed, and the impregnated air instantly corrected. It is here that we should speak of the sanitary opera- tions at the Lazaret at Marseilles, which I recommended to his Excellency the Minister of the Interior, and which the superior council of public health has adopted for some time past, the execution of it being entrusted to the enlightened zeal of the professional men who are charged with the care of this useful establishment; but these views will have more interest after experience has confirmed them. It will not be out of place here, to re- port the experiments made during two nights at Bicetre, * Those who arc appointed to attest ilic death of persons, and others engaged with the sick, may secure themselves from foetid emanation by smelling- the Chlorate, carried in a bottle for that purpose.

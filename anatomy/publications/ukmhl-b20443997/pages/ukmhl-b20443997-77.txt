33 might, perhaps, have contributed to this confidence. We were in an infected sewer, which had not been cleaned for more than forty years, eight workmen had been seized with asphyxia shortly after entering it. This occurence happened in 1782, and was the subject of a paper written by M.

Would it not be possible to empty this sewer without the occurence of accidents ? Such was the question I proposed to myself, at a time when I was surrounded by fatal exhalations, and to which question, I thought myself justified in giving an affirmative answer. But to obtain this object it will be necessary to employ the Stove of Darcet, (one of the most useful inventions with which I am acquainted,) with an abundant use of the Chlorate, together with other hygienic means, which might be directed by the local Authorities.

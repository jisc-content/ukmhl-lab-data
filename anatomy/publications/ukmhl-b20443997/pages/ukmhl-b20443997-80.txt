3d In the mouth of'Lhe Balloon Bottle, lute a large curved tube, and one also in the shape of an S ; the first tube is inserted into a bottle containing a small quantity of water, a similar tube passing from this into the Bottle containing the saline solution. The lutes being dry, a mixture of 576 Grammes Sulphuric Acid, and 448 Gram- mes water, is to be poured into the Balloon through the cunred tube S, heat is next applied and gradually re- gulated until the disengagement of Chlorine gas ceases. Thst. Powdered Bengal Indigo, one part, Concentrated Sulphuric Aeid, six parts, Mix, and add Nine Hundred and Ninety-three parts of distilled water—one part of the Chlorate of Soda, mixed with Eighteen parts of this liquid, should deprive it of colour. The saline solution should be of the specific gravity of 12°* by Baume's hydrometer—-if the liquid be too con- centrated, add the requisite quantity of water; if, on the contrary, the solution is too weak, add as much of the car- bonate of Soda as will bring it to the proper strength. • 1,089 of common standard; tempcrtalur 55, Fah.

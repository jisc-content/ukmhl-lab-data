21 jcction produced a diminution very remarkable in the secretion and odour of the pus; a second, performed forty-eight hours after, was followed by a similar success, and two more injections, performed at an interval of two days, placed the patient in a state to attend his occupa- tion, by using the catheter for drawing off the water, He did not experience the slightest ill effects during the use of the Chlorate thus diluted. The destruction of other noxious principles is effected by the application of the Chlorate, but my experience does not yet allow me to assert it as a fact. The linen and pledgets of lint, which have been used for the dressing of foetid sores, retain their odour for a long time, and contribute to the insalubrity of the room where they are placed. By pouring a glass of the con- centrated Chlorate into ten pints of water, and soaking the linen in this liquid, they may be withdrawn imme- diately, for they will have lost their odour. The disinfection of the market-places in August, 1824, by order of authority, with the facts reported in the notice issued on this occasion, proves to how many useful purposes the alkaline and earthy Chlorates may be applied, if employed for the destruction of the causes of noxious effluvia, and these investigations will terminate by bringing the remedy into habitual and domestic use. By the foregoing detail, I have complied with the con- ditions into which I was forced to enter. Public salubrity shews the necessity of sprinkling dead bodies, (which begin to give evident signs of decomposition) with the disinfecting Chlorate, before the time pre- scribed by usage and by law for their interment. In this case a bottle of the concentrated Chlorate must be put

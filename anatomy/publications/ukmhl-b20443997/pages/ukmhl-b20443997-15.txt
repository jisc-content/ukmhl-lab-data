There is; but it is a mode altogether artificial—the self-restoring principle can here do nothing—but the surgeon can remove, with quick and dextrous hand, the cause of all this pain. But if that hand be uninformed, if it has not previously, on the dead body, dissected often and carefully the parts to be divided, and the parts to be left untouched, if it has not often repeated on the dead, the operation which it has now to perform upon the living, it cannot be trusted, and the sufferer must be left to pine by turns, and by turns to madden again, till his frame is worn out, and at length he expires. The three instances which I have selected, are suffi- cient to illustrate the nature of the healing art, and to show its absolute dependence on a knowledge of the hu- man structure. The healing art is plainly a handicraft, of which the subject is the living body. If the handicrafts- man know the structure of the body, he will operate upon it dextrously and to much good purpose, but if he know it not, he will mangle and abuse it.

His memoir, read at the Royal Academy of Medicine, gave rise to a learned report. A very remarkable fact was observed in a case of Asphyxia presenting the most serious tetanic symptoms, the patient was restored by breathing the Chlorate of Soda. M. Lisfranc, Chief Surgeon to La Pitie, treated his successful cases of burns and common ulcers, by means of the Chlorates; the memoir which he intends publish- ing on the subject, and which was announced to the Royal Academy of Medicine, will be highly interesting. Ulcer of the nose (L'ozlne) has been disinfected by Injections used twice a day, of the Chlorate of Soda diluted with, from 2 to 10 parts of water, and this foetid ulcer cured. In certain disorders of the bladder, the urine becomes offensive and disgusts the patient; the disinfection is ac- complished by placing a few drops of the concentrated Chlorate of Soda in the chamber pot.

29 Lime having the property of absorbing humidity, com- bines with the moisture of the disinfected body. Now, one of the conditions of putrefaction being moisture, it follows, that when once the disinfecting action is in operation, the Chlorate, after a longer or shorter time, according to the quantity, changes it state, and furnishes materials for reproducing the fcetidness. On the con- trary, the Chlorate of Soda, in passing to the state of an /iv/^ro-Chlorate, produces the formation of a very dry .salt, that absorbs the moisture, which is the principle of putrefaction. This is what I term a secondary pro- perty. The Chlorate of Soda, therefore, when used for disinfection, prevents', at all times, the reproduction of putrefaction. It is particularly suitable for application to sores of bad character, from the property which it pos- sesses of detaching the disorganized tissue from that which preserves its vital qualities ; whilst the Chlorate of Lime, if it is well saturated, can be used only for simple disinfection, such as in the exhumation of bodies which are to be immediately examined. It is also suitable for the disinfection of the bodies lying at the Morgue, because the sprinklings of the Chlorated water are there frequently renewed.* The Chlorate of * M. Idt, a distinguished " Pharmacien" at Lyons, writes to me from that town, under the date of 5th. August, 1825. " During the whole of the month of July, the Themomctcr " was constantly at 34 degrees, and bodies, a very few hours after " their death, exhaled an odour of such an infectious nature, that *' whilst mass was performing for the repose of their souls, the " Priests and Mourners forgot their duty, ( the one, resignation to " their ministry, the other, their grief) to complain and hold their " noses. The Surgeon Major of the Hotel Dieu, M. Gensaul, justly " fearing that such mephitic emanations might occasion an epidemic a disorder, proposed to the Major, to have a glass of jour solution

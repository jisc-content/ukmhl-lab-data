17 the wretch who is expiring from a draught of poison, is equally guilty with him who mingled it, and with him who gave it, then he who by the least unnecessary action, or by the least unnecessary word, opposes the study of anatomy, is neither more nor less than a murderer. By his opposition, he, as it were, poisons the balm of medicine, which promised to give a little ease to horrid sufferingâ€”he puts out his foot to make the surgeon stumble, who is running with help to the wounded and the dying. Would to God that the eyes of the public were open to the consequences of their idolatry of the dead! They would then spurn with contempt, the plans of those ig- norant men, who have vapoured over their midnight bowl, that they would put an end to anatomy, blind to the widely disastrous effects, which their plans, if carried on, must speedily produce on the best and dearest in- terests of humanity. Instead of seeking to degrade the anatomist, or to disturb him in his pursuits, the public, if they rightly understood the matter, and could for a moment listen to reason, not to passion, would be eager to honour and to assist a man, who for the sake of re- lieving the sufferings of his fellow-creatures, can take up his abode with death and corruption, make the most loathsome objects on which eye can ever look his familiar associates, and even risk his life in acquiring that know- ledge which is to enable him to preserve and restore the health of those who hate and persecute him. c

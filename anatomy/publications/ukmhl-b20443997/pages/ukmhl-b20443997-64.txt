20 Chlorate, and I introduce it here, to draw the attention of Professional men to analagous cases. M.

The hypogastric region was swollen and painful; the urine, turbid and smelling of ammonia, deposited a thick, brown and foetid pus; the tongue dry; the skin hot; the breathing oppressed; the voice hoarse and feeble; there was much nervous irritation accom- panied at times by delirium.

The instrument was suffered to remain for two days, but became often obstructed. Injections were frequently used, but with little success ; this, at length, determined M.

28 Bells, of Barclay, are cited as proofs, not of a mere e- quality, but of a superiority in anatomical skill, above every other nation in Europe. But to what cause, I would ask, is the professional excellence of these celebrat- ed men to be attributed, unless to this, that from peculiar circumstances, they have been enabled to engage more freely than others in anatomical researches? All those whose names are above enumerated, have been employ- ed in the teaching of anatomy, and have thus had oppor- tunities of prosecuting that science to a degree which is at present totally beyond the reach even of teachers. But it is not the teachers of anatomy only who ought to be in- timately acquainted with the structure of the body. Every one whose intention it is to practise medicine, and especially surgery, ought to possess a thorough ana- tomical knowledge. Those who teach anatomy, are forced indeed to take the only right method of acquiring a knowledge of that science; that is to say, they make it their first object to see and handle the things with which they require to be acquainted, and their second object to know them. To begin by affecting to know these same things, by having read about them, and heard them de- scribed, and then to try to see and touch them, which has been the common method of pursuing the study of anatomy, is palpably absurd, and can never be attended with success. The following are the heads of a plan for promoting the practical study of anatomy, which I have already communicated to several distinguished members of the

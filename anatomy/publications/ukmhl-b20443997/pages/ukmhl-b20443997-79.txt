35 The effect of the Chlorate will, berhaps, appear sur- prising in this case, considering the time that had elapsed since the accident (48 hours). Persons who have breathed gases, exhaled from animal matter in a state of putrefaction, must have remarked, that the foetid con- dition of some of the excretions produced by the inhala- tion of the gas, continues for a long time afterwards. It appears to me very desirable to recommend pati- ents to breathe the Chlorate of Soda, and of Lime, in all cases of asphyxia, occasioned by sewers and privies, even long after the occurrence of the accident, should they still find themselves under the influence of the deleterious gas.

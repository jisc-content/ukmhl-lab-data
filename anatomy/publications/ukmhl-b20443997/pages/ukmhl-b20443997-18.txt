10 raising of a piece of depressed skull, the treatment of a gun-shot wound, the removal of a shattered or mortified limb, these are things about which no cunning will be of any use but the cunning learned by practical exercises in the schools of anatomy. If the surgeon is acquainted with the structure of the body from careful and repeated examination with his own hands, he will proceed in such cases with a calm and confident assurance that he can meet only with parts which he knows, and that the whole object of his practice is to bring these parts back, as far as is possible, to certain relations with which he is perfectly acquainted, and to that harmonious action, the mechan- ism of which he perfectly understands. If his know- ledge of anatomy has not been derived from actual dis- section, but amounts merely to the vague recollections which remain of what he had seen and heard at public lectures, being in fact unacquainted with the natural po- sition of the parts of the body, how can he judge of the degree of their derangement, and how can he ascertain that his reduction of them is complete ? Unacquainted with the relations between the muscles, arteries and nerves of a limb, a knowledge of which can be obtained in no other way than by repeated dissections, how shall he avoid the muscles and nerves, and put down his fin- ger upon the bleeding artery ? Knowing no more of the anatomy of the parts concerned in the operation for stone, than what he has gathered from the demonstra- tions of another person, or from seeing a preparation of the bladder, separated from all the parts with which it was connected, how else can that operation be regarded

34 ing thousands, the red and living blood is pouring in torrents, the air is rent with agonizing cries, and in a little hour the ground is covered with weltering corpses. We have seen the day, when Britain, reckoning up the slain, coolly subtracted the number of her own sons whose blood had drenched a foreign soil, and whose bones, stript by the hungry vulture, were left to bleach in the storm. The humane and feeling public received the es- timate of slaughter with rapture. It was the estimate of what they had won. The youth, the vigour, and the beauty of the fallen were forgotten. The loud lamenta- tions of the widow, the mother, and the sister, refusing to be comforted, were lost in the deafening cry of victory. The hour was given to madness, and midnight's darkness could not hide the wantonness of mirth and triumph. Propose the question of the propriety of dedicating to the humane purposes of anatomical instruction, a few, and only a few of the dead bodies of those individuals who expire in the hospitals, changed and worn out by disease, without a relative or a friend to carry them out to the grave, and whose very names are perhaps for- gotten ; the feeling public slip on the ready mask of ten- der-heartedness, and raising their hands in well-affected horror at the proposal, threaten with condign punish- ment, the poor foolish anatomist, who is cursed with an enthusiasm for the relief of human woe, and who foresees, in the researches which he is forbidden to insti- tute, the discovery of a new or a better means of curing or assuaging some excruciating, or some mortal disease.

INTRODUCTION. The manuscript now for the first time printed is in the handwriting of Harvey, as may be seen by a comparison with his letter published some years since by Sir George Paget and with other letters in his handwriting. The title-page bears his signature, “per me Gulielmum Harveium,” and the date A.D. 1616. The manuscript, with another volume also in his handwriting, formed part of the collection of Sir Hans Sloane, which became the property of the nation in 1753. Of its history from 1657, the year of Harvey’s death, till 1753 nothing is certainly known. At the death of many physicians of his time, as of Dr. Francis Bernard (1698) and of Dr. Edward Browne (1708), Sir Hans Sloane bought their manuscripts and note-books, and it was most likely from a purchase of this kind that the manuscript became part of the Sloane collection. Dr. Lawrence, the editor of the edition of Harvey’s works published by the College of Physicians in 1766, had examined the manuscript and describes it correctly. Somewhat later the volume got among printed books, and could not be found among the manuscripts of the Museum. In the year 1877 it was restored to its proper place in the collection. In that year it was exactly described by Sir Edward Sieveking in his Harveian oration, who read several extracts from it and exhibited an autotype of one of its most important pages. Sir Edward Sieveking continued his investigations, and at his suggestion the subject was brought before the Royal College of Physicians, where, on March 30, 1885, Dr. George Johnson asked for the appointment of a committee to consider the question of printing in facsimile the manuscript notes of the anatomical lectures of Harvey, and gave notice that he would at the next meeting ask the College to guarantee two hundred guineas towards the expense. Dr. George Johnson, Sir Edward Sieveking, Dr. F. Payne, Dr. Stone, and Dr. Norman Moore were appointed a committee to consider the question. The

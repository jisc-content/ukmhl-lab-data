STJPEEIOE MAXILLARY NEETE. 69 In the Gasserion Ganglion. 70 It passes forwards, leaving tlie Cranixim through, the Foramen Eotundum of the Sphenoid Bone, it then crosses the Spheno-maxillary Fossa to the Infra Orhital Foramen, through which it passes, to be dis- tributed to the Eyelid, Nose, Face, Upper Lip, &c. 71 These, according to some Anatomists, (Wilson), are arranged in three sets, viz., those given off in the Spheno-maxillary Fossa, those in the Infra-orbital Canal, and those on the Face. 72 The Orbital; two to Meckel's Ganglion, and the posterior Dental. 73 The Spheno-maxillary Fissure. 74 Two Branches, Malar and Temporal, the former sup- plying the Integument of the Cheek, and the latter, the side of the Head. 75 The Facial, Temporal and anterior Auricular. 76 The middle and anterior Dental Branches. 77 The Muscular and Cutaneous Branches 78 Branches of the Facial Nerve which form an intricate Plexus, called the Infra-orbital Plexus. 79 A small Branch to the lower Eyelid, (Palpebral.) 80 The Muscular and Cutaneous Branches supply the Muscles and Integuments of the Cheek, Nose, and Upper Lip. 81 A Sensory Nerve. INPEEIOE MAXILLAET NEEVE. 82 The inferior MaxiUary, which is the last of its three divisions. 83 From the Gasserion Ganglion. 84 Through the Foramen Ovale of the Sphenoid Bone. 85 Into two Primary Branches; an anterior or Motory, and a posterior or Sensory. 86 The external Pterygoid Muscle. 87 The anterior and posterior Temporal, Masseteric, inter- nal Pterygoid and Buccal Branches. 88 To the Temporo-maxillary Eegion. 89 The Auriculo-Temporal, inferior Dental and Gustatory. 90 Two to the Meatus Auditorius, the anterior Auricular Branch, Parotid, and one or two Branches which communicate with the Facial and Sympathetic. 91 It first descends between the internal and external Pterygoid Muscles, it then passes between the former

216 ANSWEES TO QTTESTI0K3 24 In the Lateral Sinus on cither side, 25 "Within the Ventricles of the Brain by the convergence of two Veins which fonn the Vena) Galeni, 26 On the surface of the Corpus Striatum are observed several minute Veins which unite and form one Vein, called Vena Corporis Striati, which communicates with one of the Veins of the Choroid Plexus, and these on either side form together the two Verne Galeni. 27 In the straight Sinus. 28 Like the Cerebral into a superficial and deep set. 29 In the straight Sinus, also the Vente Galeni. 30 In the lateral and superior Petrosal Sinuses. CEEEBEAX SINUSES. 31 By the inner or Serous Lining of the Veias, and the Fibrous Layer of the Dura Mater, which latter does not extend beyond the base of the SkuU. 32 Into two setsâ€”those situated within the prominent Folds of the Dura Mater, and those situated at the base of the Skull. 33 The superior and inferior Longitudinal Sinuses, the Straight Sinus, the Occipital Sinus, and the Lateral Sinuses. 34 From the Crista GaUi of the Ethmoid Bone to the inner Tuberosity of the Occipital Bone, where it terminates in a dilatation called Torcular HerophiH, which forms the Conflux of five or six Sinuses. 35 Triangular, with its apex towards the front. 36 The superficial Cerebral Veins, also numerous small Veins from the substance and exterior of the SkuH (the Diploe, &c.) 37 Chordse WilUsii. 38 Glandulse Pacchioni. 39 In the lower concave border of the Falx Cerebri. 40 From near the Crista Galli of the Ethmoid Bone to the edge of the Tentorium, where it opens in the Straight Sinus. 41 Along the middle of the Tentorium, and appears to be the continuation of the inferior Longitudinal Sinus. 42 Like the superior Longitudinal it is triangular. 43 The Venae Galeni and the superficial Cerebellar Veins. 44 Along the attached border of the Falx CerebcUi. 45 From the Foramen Magnum to the Conflux vel Torcular Herophili, into which it opens.

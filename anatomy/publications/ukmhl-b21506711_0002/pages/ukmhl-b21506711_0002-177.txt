ON HUMAN ANATOMY. 175 217 The inferior Branch.. 218 Yes. 219 Lamina Cribrosa,—so called from its numerous perfor- ations. 220 A small Osseous Canal, which is lodged in the Petrous Bone. 221 At the upper and inner part of the Meatus Auditorius Internus, & tenninates in the Stylo-mastoid Foramen. 222 The Facial Nerve (Portio Dura). 223 From a Branch derived from the superior Cerebellar Artery, which accompanies the Auditory Nerve into the internal Meatus, and which divides into two Branches—the Vestibular and Cochlear, which sub- divide into smaller Branches. 224 Into the superior Petrosal Sinus in the base of the Skull. S25 A Nerve of Sensation. 226 A Nerve of Motion. USE OP THE PAETS OP THE EAE. 227 To collect the undidations or vibrations of the air (the soimd), and reflect them towards the external Meatus. 228 To concentrate and convey those sonorous vibrations to the Membrana Tympani. 229 To transmit the vibrations to the Bones within the Tympanum. 230 To regulate the tension of the Membrana Tympani. 231 By their motions they multiply the vibrations they receive from the Membrana Tympani, and transmit them to the Fluid in the Labyrinth. 232 This Fluid, being incompressible, transmits the undu- lations which it receives all over the fine Nervous Membrane which Hnes the Labyrinth. 233 The Auditory Nerve. 234 This Canal, admitting the free entrance of air into and from the Cavity of the Tympanum, preserves a due balance or equilibrium with the external air, and thus enables the Membrana Tympani to act in obedience to the slightest impressions. Section XXIX.—THE MOUTH AND OEGAN OF TASTE. 1 The irregular Cavity which is situated below that of the Nose, extending from the Lips in front to the Fauces behind.

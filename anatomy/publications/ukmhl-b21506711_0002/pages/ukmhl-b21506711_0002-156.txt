154 AKSWEES TO QXTESTIOITS 31 In tho centre of this Cribiiform Lamella, and transmits the Arteria Centralis Retinae to the Eye. COKNEA. 32 The firm transparent Layer which forms the anterior fifth of the EyebaU. 33 Convex, and in contact with the Conjunctiva. 34 Concave, and in contact with the Aqueous Humour. 35 It is received by its margin within the bevelled border of the Sclerotica, like a watch-glass fixed within the edge of its case. 36 Its transverse diameter, about the one-fifteenth of an inch. 37 The Sclerotic Tunic. 38 It transmits the rays of light into the organ. 39 It becomes flaccid and opaque from infiltration of the Aqueous Fluid. 40 It consists of a series of concentric Laminaeâ€”an outer one, which is strong and thick, called the Cornea Proper; another within, which is elastic, called the Cornea Elastica; and another still finer elastic Mem- brane, covered by an Epithelium. 41 The Conjunctiva. 42 The two elastic structures, which are named the Mem- brane of Demours. 43 A series of Layers, between fifty and sixty in number, which are fibrous and render the structure firm and tough. 44 In the healthy state of the Membrane they do not, but cease at its circumference. 45 It is well supplied with Nerves. THE CHOEOID (tTJNICA VASCTTLOSA). 46 The most Vascular Coat of the Eye, consisting principally of Blood-vessels and Pigment Cells. 47 A rich chocolate-brown. 48 A deep black. 49 Between the Sclerotica and Eetina, extending from the entrance of the Optic Nerve to the Ciliaiy Ligament. 50 A Foramen for the transmission of the Optic Nerve. 51 Thi-ee : an external, a middle, and an internal Layer. 52 Arteries and Veins, chiefly Veins, which pxu-sue a con- torted or flexuous course, hence called Venae Vorticosse. 53 The ramifications of the minute Arteries, which secrete the Pigmentum Nigrum. 54 The Pigmentaiy Membrane (Choroidal Epithelium), which presents on its surface hexagonal Cells with

ON nuMAN ANATOMY. 243 7 The anterior Longitudinal Fissure. 8 About one-third of the thickness of the Cord. 9 By transverse Fibres of Medullary Matter, -which con- stitute the anterior Commissure. 10 The posterior. 11 By Fibres of Grey Matter which pass into the interior of the Cord. 12 By the transverse Fibres of White Matter which consti- tute the anterior Commissure. 13 Two lateral Fissures (anterior and posterior). 14 The attachment of the Fibrils of the anterior and post- erior Eoots of the Spinal Nerves. 15 The posterior lateral Fissure. i 16 In the Grey Matter in the interior of the Cord. 17 Four: the anterior, lateral, posterior, and posterior Median Columns. 18 The Motor Columns, which give origin to the anterior Roots of the Spinal Nerves. 19 Corpora Pyramidalia. 20 The Sensory Colunms which give origin to the posterior Eoots of the Spinal Nerves. 21 Corpora Restiformia. 22 Yes (EUis) and gives attachment to the anterior or Motor Roots. 23 In the Medulla Oblongata. 24 Unknown. 25 At the upper part. 26 The Median posterior Column. 27 Variously: sometimes in a rounded point a few lines below the Lumbar Enlargement, sometimes in a small Bulb slightly constricted at its centre (Gall and Spurzheim), but its termination is only a secondary consideration, as it does not give attachment to any Nerve. 28 By the continuation of the tliree Membranes which invest the Brain. DUKA ITATEK. 29 It is only loosely attached to the Cord. 30 It forms a Sheath to the upper part of the Sacrum, and from thence it is continued as an impervious Cord to the Coccyx, under the old name of Cauda Equina. 31 That in the Neck and Loins. 32 Some Vessels, also Adipose Tissue. 33 Yes; and very adherent.

188 ANSTVEHS TO QUESTIONS 33 The Branches of tliis Artery are divided into three portions, according to their position; thus one portion arises beneath the Eamus of the Jaw, another portion beneath the Temporal Muscle, and the other portion in the Spheno-maxillary Fossa, and are respectively called the Maxillary, Pterygoid, and Ptergygo-max- illary portions. 34 The inferior Dental, which supplies the Teeth of the lower Jaw, enters its Ramus in conjunction with the Dental JS'erve through the Dental Foramen; the middle Meningeal Branch supplies the Dura Mater, entering the Cranium through the Foramen Spinosum in the Spinous Process of the Sphenoid Bone; the Tympanic Branch, which is distributed to the Cavity of the same name, enters the Tympanum through the FissuraGlasseri velGlenoidalis; and lastly, the small Meningeal Artery, which supplies the Dura Mater in the middle Fossa of the SkuU, passes through the Foramen Ovale of the Sphenoid Bone in conjunction with the inferior Maxillary Nerve. 35 The deep Temporal (two in number), the Masseteric, the two Pterygoid (internal and external), and the Buccal, are distributed, as their names imply, to their respective Muscles. 36 The superior (or posterior) Dental Branch, whose Branches enter numerous small Foramina in the superior Maxilla, to supply the upper Molares and Bicuspides, also its Antrum; the Nasal or Spheno- palatine Branch, which enters the Canal of the same name into the Nasal Cavity, to which it is distributed; the Pterygo-palatine Branch, which passes through the Pterygo-palatine Canal, to be dishibuted to the Pharynx and Eustachian Tube; the posterior Palatine Branch, which passes through the Canal of the same name, to be distributed to the Gums, Soft Palate, Tonsils, &c.; and the Vidian or Pterygoid Branch, which passes with the Vidian Nerve into the Canal of the same name to be distributed to the Eustachian Tube and upper part of the Pharynx; and lastly, the Infra-orbital Branch. 37 As their name implies, to the Parotid Gland, three and sometimes four in number; they opcasionaUy arise from the Temporal Artery.

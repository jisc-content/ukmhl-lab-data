114 ANSWEES TO QTTESTIOJTS 130 The Bronchus is the most superior, the Veins the most inferior, and between the two is the Artery. 131 The only two Vessels which change places are the Bronchus and Artery; the Artery is the most superior. 132 From the circumstance of the left Bronchus being at a lower level than the right Bronchus. 133 By the collection of the minute Cells into bundles or groups called Lobuli. 134 By the aggregation of the Lobuli. 135 By a Serous Layer, derived from the Pleura, which is continued over the surface, and by a Sub-serous Layer which dips into its interior, which subdivides it into pieces; the latter Layer contains Fibres of elastic Tissue, and divides the small masses into Lobules. 136 Of a Polyhedrous fonn, and about the one hundred-and- fiftieth of an inch across.

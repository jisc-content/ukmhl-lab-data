254 ANSWEES TO QUESTIONS 168 The_Trifacial vel Trigeminus, which is analogous to a Spinal Nerve, possessing both Motory and Sensory- functions, and the existence of a Ganglion (the Gas- serion) on the larger or posterior Root. Section LV.—SPINAL NERYES. 1 Thirty-one pairs. 2 By two Roots: an anterior or Motor, and a posterior or Sensory Root. 3 From the White or Medullary portion on the anterior Columns. 4 From the Grey or Cineritious portion on the posterior aspect of the Cord. 5 A Ganglion. 6 External to the Ganglia. 7 A Spinal Nerve. 8 Through the Intervertebral Foramina, the first and last excepted. 9 They each divide into two Branches—anterior and post- erior ; the former distributed to the front part of the body, and the latter to the posterior part of the body. 10 Into four Sets or Groups: Cervical, Dorsal, Lumbar, and Sacral. CERVICAL NEETES. 11 Eight pairs. 12 Horizontally. 13 Between the Occipital Bone and Atlas or first Vertebra (the Sub-occipital). 14 Between the last Cervical and first Dorsal Vertebra. 15 It forms a loop by luiiting with an Ascending Branch from the second Cervical Nerve. 16 Some to the Vagus, Lingual, and Sympathetic. 17 To the Complexus, Rectus Anticus Major et Minor, Obliquus Superior et Inferior. CERVICAL PLEXTTS. 18 By the anterior Primary Branches of the four upper Cervical Nerves. 19 At the upper part of the Neck on the middle Scalenus, Levator Anguli Scapulas, and Splenius Muscles, and beneath the Stemo-mastoid and Platysma Muscles. 20 Into two Sets : Superficial and Deep. 21 Into Ascending and Descending Branches. 22 Superficial Cervical (or Superficiahs CoUi), great Auric- ular, and smaller Occipital Branch.

ON HTJMAK ANATOMT. 191 73 These Branclies, two or three in numher, are called Ai'terias Eeceptaculi. Section XXXIII.—AETEEIES OF THE UPPEE EXTEEMITIES. STTBCLATIAjST akteeies. 1 Two : one for each upper extremity. 2 The right arises from the Arteria Innominata, and the left from the posterior part of the Arch of the Aorta. 3 jSTo ; the course of this Vessel may for convenience he divided into three parts—the first part of the right differs fr-om that of the left, whilst the two other parts are alike, thus, the first part of the right Subclavian passes outwards to the inner margin of the Scalenus Anticus Muscle; whilst the first part of the left Sub- clavian passes peipendicularly upwards to the inner margin of the Scalenus Anticus. 4 It forms a curve which passes outwards behind the Scalenus Anticus Muscle. 5 It passes outwards and downwards beneath the Clavicle and Subclavius Muscle to the lower border of the fii'st Eib, where it terminates in the Axillary Artery. 6 The internal Jugular, Subclavian, and small Vertebral Veins; the Par-vagum, the Phrenic and Cardiac Branches of the Sympathetic Nerve; also, the common Integument, deep Fascia, Stemo-mastoid, Sterno- thyroid, and Stemo-hyoid Muscles. 7 The Eecurrent Branch of the Par-vagum, and the Sypathetic IS'erve; and, below, is the Pleura. 8 Pleura and upper part of the left Lung, the left Brachio- cephalic Vein (vel Vena Innominata), the Par-vagum, • also, the common Integument, deep Fascia, Stemo- mastoid, Thyroid and Hyoid Muscles. 9 The Longus Colli Muscle, Vertebral Column, and the inferior Cervical Ganglion. 10 CEsophagus and Thoracic Duct. 11 The Pleura. 12 The Scaleni. 13 Integument, Platysma Myoides, deep Fascia, Branches of the Cervical Plexus and internal Jugular Vein. 14 It rests on the surface of the first Eib. 15 The Subclavius Muscle and Vein, and the Supra-scapular Artery and Vein. 16 The Scdenus Posticus.

Olf HUMAN ANATOMY. 7 3 Some of the Cranial Bones consist of two Osseous Tables or Plates separated by the Diploc, tbe external of wbicb is the thickest. 4 Eight. 5 Occipital, Frontal, two Temporal, two Parietal, Sphenoid, and Ethmoid. 6 Eourteen. 7 Two superior llaxillary, two Malar, two Palate, two Lachi-ymal, two Nasal, two inferior Turbinated, the Vomer, and inferior Maxillary. 8 The two Temporal, two Parietal, and the Occipital. 9 The Erontal, Ethmoid, and Sphenoid. SUTTJXtES OP THE SKXTLL. 10 The union of the Bones by SeiTated or Dentiform margins. 11 Coronal, Sagittal, Erontal, Squamous, Lambdoidal, &c. 12 The Coronal Sutiu'e connects the two Parietal Bones with the Erontal, hence called Eronto-parietal Suture; it extends across the superior part of the Skull, from the great wing of the Sphenoid Bone on one side to its fellow on the opposite side. 13 The Sagittal or Inter-pai'ietal Suture extends from the centre of the Coronal Suture along the middle lino to the Occipital Bone. 14 The Erontal Suture extends from the centre of the Coronal Suture down the middle line of the Eorehead to the root of the Nose. 15 The Squamous Suture is placed laterally over each ex- ternal Meatus of the Ear; it connects the Squamous portion of the Temporal Bone with the Parietal; also the greater wing of the Sphenoid with the Temporal, by the Squamo-sphenoidal Sutiu'e. 16 The Lambdoidal or Occipito-parietal Suture unites the Occipital Bone to the two Parietal Bones. Section VI.â€”BONES OE THE SXULL. OCCIPITAL BONE. 1 The Occipital Bone contributes to form a part of the base and posterior part of the Cranium. 2 Trapezoid. 3 Into two surfaces: external or Occipital, and internal or Cerebral; four borders and four angles. 4 Convex. 5 The Occipital protuberance. 6 The superior curved line. 7 From the lateral Angle to the other.

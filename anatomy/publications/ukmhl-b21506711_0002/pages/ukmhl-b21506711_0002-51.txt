49 Olf HUIIAN' AKATOMT. 259 The insertions of the Extensor Carj^i Eadialis Brcvior, and the origins of the Adductor Pollicis (on its Palmar asi^ect), and the Interossei. 260 To its angular process. 261 By its base or upper exti'emity, being small and square, and by the absence of the angTilar projecting process. 26:3 Place the Bone with the base looking towards yourself and the Dorsal aspect upwards; the base will then be slightly inclined towards the side to which it belongs. 263 Palmar and Dorsal Interossei. 264 By its having only one lateral articular surface corres- pondihg with that on the Ulnar side of the Metacarpal Bone of the ring Pinger. 265 Place the Bone with the base looking towards yourself and the Dorsal aspect upwards; that side of the base which has no articular sm-face wiU be directed to the Hand to which it belongs. 266 To its base, the insertion of the Extensor Carpi TJlnaris, and by origin, to its Ulnar Border, the Adductor vel Opponens Minimi Digiti, and the Palmar and Dorsal Interossei. 267 Nine; five Phalangeal and four Carpal. 268 Three; one for the shaft and one for each extremity. PHALANGES. 269 Fourteen to each hand, viz.: three to each Finger and two to the Thumb. 270 pQto a shaft and two extremities, viz.: a Head and Base. 271 Convex posteriorly and flat anteriorly. 272 Eidges or margins for the attachments of the Fibrous Sheaths of the Tendons. 273 Oval and concave for the reception of the convex Head of the corresponding Metacarpal Bone. 274 The insertions of the Interossei. 275 By two small Condyles (separated by a slight Eidge), corresponding to the bases of the contiguous Bones of the Fingers. 276 By their greater length and by their upper or Meta- carpal extremities not strictly forming hinge-joints. 277 By their bases or upper extremities having two articu- late surfaces, separated by a small Eidge, correspond- ing with the Heads or lower extremities of the con- tiguous surfaces of the first Phalanges.

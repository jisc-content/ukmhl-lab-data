262 ANSWERS TO aTTESTIONS external Labia, also to the upper and inner part of the Thigh. 10 This Branch also arises from the first Lumbar !N"erve, and like the preceding, is directed over the Quadratus Lumborum to the crest of the Ilium, where it enters the Wall of the Abdomen, by perforating the Trans- yersalis Abdominis Muscle, and gives off two Branches an Iliac and Hypogasb'ic Branch; the former sup- plying the Integument of the Grluteal Region, and the latter (which sometimes escapes through the external Abdominal Hing) supplying the Integument (as its name implies) of the Abdominal Parietes of the lower Region. 11 This Branch arises from the second JTerve of the Lumbar Plexus; it perforates the middle of the outer border of the Psoas Muscle, and passes obliquely over the Iliacus Muscle to the space between the anterior Iliac Spinous Processes, and quits the Abdomen into the Thigh beneath Poupart's Ligament, it then pierces the Fascia Lata, and divides into two Branchesâ€” anterior and posterior, which are distributed to the corresponding surfaces on the outer Aspect of the Limb. 12 This Branch also arises from the second Nerve of the Lumbar Plexus, also from the communicating loop between this Nerve and the first, it then pierces the Psoas Magnus, and running down its anterior surface to near Poupart's Ligament divides into two Branches, a Genital and Crural, the former supplying the Cord and Cremastcr in the Male, and round Ligament in the Female, and the latter or Cnu-al Branch escapes below Poupart's Ligament and supplies the Integu- ment on the anterior aspect of the Thigh, its upper half. 13 This Branch, the largest of the Lumbar Plexus, aiises from the second, thii'd and fourth Nerves, appears from beneath the Psoas Muscle, and passing downwards between it and the Iliacus, escapes from the Abdomen into the Thigh beneath Poupai-t's Ligament and divides into several Branches. 14 Yes, some Muscular Twigs to the Psoas and Iliacus Muscles. 15 These are superficial and deep; the superficial consists of three Branches viz: the internal and middle Cuta- neous and the long or internal Saphenous Nerve; the

Section II.â€”THE BOI^ES IN GENERAL. 1 The Membrane which invests the external surface of all the Bones, except the Crowns of the Teeth: it is called Pericranium, where it lines the Craniiun; Periorbita, in the Orbits; Perichondrium where it covers Cartilage, and Peridesmium when it covers Ligament. 2 To strengthen the union of Bones; to afford attach- ment to Ligaments and Muscles; to conduct and support Vessels in their course to Bones, &c. 3 Into three Classes : 1st, the long or Cylindrical Bones; 2nd, the broad or flat, and 3rd, the short mixed or irregular Bones. 4 The shaft or middle portion of the Bone, which first Ossifies, is called the Diaphysis, and the other por- tions which are last Ossified the Epiphysis. 5 A process or projection of Bone over a plain siuface as the Nasal Apoj)hysis of the Erontal Bone, &c. 6 Yes, more especially diu-ing Ossification. 7 By innumerable Eoramina over theii- external surface. 8 By the tinge which they receive, when young animals ai-e fed with madder, as accidentally discovered by Mr. Belchier. 9 The Oleaginous Eluid contained in the Medullary Cavi- ties or Cells of the long Cylindiical Bones. 10 Eoramina, Canals, Sinuses, Notches, Eossse, _ Cavities, Heads, Necks, Processes, Spines, Tuberosities, Tu- bercles, Eissvu'es, &c. 11 Little openings perforating the substance of Bones, e.g. Infra-orbital Eoramen, Stylo-mastoid Eoramen, &c. 12 Tracts or channels within the substance of Bones, e.g. Infra-orbital Canal. 13 Cavities or Depressions in Bones, e.g. Erontal and Sphenoidal Sinuses.

ON mcnVLllT ANATOMY. 15 181 Only one, corresponding with the Parietal Eminence. SPHENOID BONE. 183 It is placed horizontally at the base of the SkuU, being connected with all the Bones of the Cranium, and several of those of the Face. 183 Into a Body, "Wings and Processes. 184 That central part of the Bone from which are projected the Wings and Processes. 185 Into foiu- sm-faces: a superior or Cerebral, an inferior, an anterior and a posterior. 186 The Pituitary Possa or Sella-tiu'cica. 187 The Pituitary Gland and Cii'cular Sinus; the latter surroimding the former. 188 The Olivary Process. 189 To support the Commissure of the Optic E'erves. 190 Outwards and forwards. 191 The Optic Nerves and Ophthalmic Arteries. 192 The two anterior Clinoid Processes, which constitute the iamer terminations of the lesser Wings. 193 The posterior Clinoid Processes. 194 The internal Carotid Artery, Cavernous Sinus, also the Sixth Nerve. 195 Part of the inner Wall of the Orbit. 196 Two small fissures which are converted into Canals by the Vomer, and called the Pterygo-palatine Canals. 197 A very small Artery of the same name, derived from the internal Maxillary Artery. 198 The Yaginal Processes between which slide the thin edge of the Vomer. 199 A vertical Plate of Bone called the Eostrum. 200 Anteriorly with the perpendicular Plate of the Ethmoid Bone and below with the Vomer. 201 On either side the Eostrum. 202 Sphenoidal spongy Bones, (Comua Sphenoidalia). 203 Plat and rough, and connected in young subjects by Cartilage and in Adults by Bone with the Basilar Process of the Occipital Bone. 204 Two thin triangular Processes which project, one on either side, transversely from the upper part of the Body and terminating in an acute point. 205 Flat and smooth, and support the anterior Lobes of the Brain. 206 Overhang the Sphenoidal fissure, and form the back part of the roof of the Orbit, on either side.

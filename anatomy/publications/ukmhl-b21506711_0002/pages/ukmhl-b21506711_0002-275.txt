ABDOMINAL GANGLIA. 80 The Semilunar Ganglia. 81 One on either side the CajliacAxis close to the Eenal Capsule. 82 By its union it forms a Ganglionic Circle, from which Branches issue in all directions. 83 The Epigastric or Solar Plexus. SOLAK PLEXUS. 84 The Great Splanchnic Nerves, some Filaments from the small Splanchnic Nerves, and some Terminal Twigs from the right Par Vagum. 85 To all the Viscera of the Abdomen above the Pelvis. 86 Plexus. 87 The Phrenic, Hepatic, Casliac, Mesenteric, Eenal, Supra-renal, and Spermatic. 88 The Gastric, Hepatic, and Splenic. 89 From the Aortic and Renal Plexuses. 90 From the left part of the Aortic Plexus. LUMBAE, GANGLIA. 91 Four, and sometimes five. 92 Along the inner border of the Psoas Muscle, and in front of the bodies of the Lumbar Vertebrte. 93 Into Distributive and Communicative. 94 Indirectly to the Viscera. 95 Two Plexusesâ€”the Aortic and the Hypogastric. 96 Some from the Solar and superior Mesenteric Plexuses. 97 In the Hypogastric Plexus. 98 In front of the upper part or Promontory of the Sacrum, between the two common Iliac Arteries. 99 It divides into two parts, which are distributed to the

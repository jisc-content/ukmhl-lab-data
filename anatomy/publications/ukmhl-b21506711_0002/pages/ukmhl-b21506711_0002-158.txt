ANSWEES TO QUESTIONS 156 78 An Anatomist of Tuscany, who discovered the Canal "wHch. is called after him in 1778. 79 This Muscle, which is composed of Unstriated Fibres, is situated on the surface of the Choroid Coat, close to the Ciliary Ligament. 80 In front of the Sclerotic Coat, and its Fibres passing backwards and inwards terminate on the Choroid Coat. 81 The E'erves of the Iris. lEIS. 82 The circular Membrane which forms an imperfect Septum between the anterior & posterior Chambers of the Eye. 83 A circular Opening for the transmission of the rays of light, called the Pupil. 84 No; it is placed somewhat nearer its Nasal side. 85 The posterior elastic Layer of the Cornea and the Ciliary Ligament. 86 The margin of the Pupil. 87 Both Vascular and Muscular, which latter consists of radiating and circular Fibres. 88 The anterior, whose Fibres converge towards the centre, and produce dilatation of the Pupil. 89 They surround the Pupil like a Sphincter, and, by their action, produce contraction of the Pupil. 90 This surface is covered with a Layer of Pigment, which, from its resemblance in colour to a ripe grape, has had the name of Uvea applied to it. 91 Towards the Cornea. 99 Towards the Lens and Ciliary Processes. 93 About one-thirtieth of an inch wide. 94 By the contraction of the radiating Fibres. 95 By the contraction of the circular Fibres. 96 In its substance they are ramified and very irregular as in the Choroid; on the anterior part they are ramified and somewhat oval; on the posterior part (the Uvea Iridis) the Cells are rounded and fiUed with Granules. 97 The colour and position of the Pigment. 98 Membrana PupiUaris. 99 Chiefly from the long and anterior Ciliary Branches, which arise from the Ophthalmic Artery. 100 To the Venae Vorticosoe of the Choroid, and end in the Ophthalmic Vein. 101 From the Ciliary Branches of the Nasal Nerve and the Lenticular Ganglion.

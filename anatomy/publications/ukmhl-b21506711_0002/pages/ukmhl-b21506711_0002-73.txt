Joint. 1 The doctiine of the Muscles. ^ 2 Muscles are the flesliy bodies composed of parallel Con- ti-actile Fibres with Tendinous extremities. 3 Those glistening, fibrous, finn, and compact Cords, by which the Muscles are attached to the surfaces of Bones. 4 If the Fibres nm longitudinally and terminate in Ten- don, they are said to be simple or Fusifonn in shape; if tliey diverge from a Tendinous centre, like a Fan, they are said to be Kadiated—e.ff., the Temporal, Pectoral, &c.; if fhej have a feathery arrangement and converge to one side of a Tendon, they are said to be Penniform, as the Peronei; and if they converge to both sides of a Tendon, they are said to be Bipen- nifoim, e.ff., Dorsales Interossei Manus. 5 The Abdominal Muscles. 6 Some ai'e named from their uses, as Flexors and Exten- sors, Levators, and Depressors, &c.; some fr'om their form, as Trapezius, Khomboideus, &c.; some from their dii'cction, as Pectus Transversalis, &c.; some from their points of attachment, as Sterno-cleido-mastoideus, Stemo-hyoid; some ft'om their situation as Occipito- frontalis, Pectoralis; others from their divisions, as Biceps, Triceps, &c. 7 The least moveable point of attachment is called its Origin. 8 The most moveable point of attachment is called the Insertion. MTTSCLES OF THE HEAD, FACE, AND IfECK. 9 Into six Eegions, viz. : the Cranial, Orbito-ocular, Xasal, superior and inferior Labial, Pterygo-maxil- lary, and Auricular. 10 Two; the Occipito-frontalis, on either side, i 11 This Musculo-tcndinous expansion or Layer, consists of two parts, with, an intervening Aponeurosis:—the Fibres at its anterior or Frontal portion arise in con- junction with those of the Orbicularis Palpebranim, and Comigator Supcrcilii, and passing upwards are CEANIAL HEGION.

180 ANSWEES TO QUESTIONS 95 Muscidar Fibres and Adipose Tissue, with the Lingual Yessels and Nerves. 96 By means of a special fibrous structure called the Hyo- glossal Membrane. 97 An Aponeurosis derived from the Genio-hyo-glossus Muscle on either side. 98 The Skin along the outer borders of the Lips; internally, with the Salivary Glands and their Ducts, with the Tonsils, and from thence into the Larynx and Pharynx, where it becomes continuous with the Gastro-pul- monary Mucous Membrane. 99 The Labial, Palatine, Buccal, Lingual Glands, &c. 100 Genio-hyo-glossus,Hyo-glossus,LinguaHs,Stylo-glossus, and Palato-glossus. 101 Yery irregular, some longitudinally, others obliquely, others again transversely. 102 From Branches of the Lingual Artery. 103 Into the Lingual Veins, which terminate in the internal Jugular Yein. 104 From three sources: the Gustatory, which is derived from the internal Trunk of the inferior Maxillary Nerve; the Lingual or Hypo-glossal Is erve; and the Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve, which latter forms one of the divisions of the eighth pair. 105 The GustatoryNerve,which is distributed tothePapillse. 106 The Lingual, which is distributed to the Muscles of the Tongue. 107 The Glosso-Pharyngeal Neiwe, which is distributed to the lining Membrane and Lingual Glands. 2 Three Layers: the Cuticle, the Rete-mucosum, and the Cutis Yera or true Skin. 3 The Cuticle is the external, the Eete-mucosum the middle, and the Cutis Yera the innermost. Layer. 4 The thin transparent Membrane which covers the Rete- mucosum and Cutis Yera. 5 Ln the Palms of the Hands and the Soles of the Feet. 6 A net-work of waving and uneven lines. 7 Perfectly smooth and uniform. 8 It is unorganised, being destitute of Yessels and Nerves. 9 It is composed of a great number of minute CeUs, which are disposed in Lamina3 on the outer surface of the Cutis Yera, and which are secreted by it.

ANSWEES TO QUESTION'S 16 207 Tlie Optic Foramen. 208 Three surfaces: a superior or Cerebral, an anterior and an external surface. 209 This sm-face which is concave forms part of the middle Fossa of the base of the Skull. 210 This smooth surface forms about one half of the outer WaU of the Orbit. 211 This surface is divided into two parts by the Pterygoid Eidge; the superior and larger part forms part of the Temporal Fossa, and the inferior forms part of the Zygomatic Fossa. 212 Part of the origin of the Pterygoideus Extemus Muscle. 213 The Spinous Process. 214 Into the angle between the Squamous and Petrous portions of the Temporal Bone. 215 The external Muscle of the Malleus, viz.: Laxator Tympani. 216 The Sphenoidal Fissure. 217 This fissure sometimes called Foramen Lacerum Orbitale, transmits the third, fourth, and sixth Nerves, the Ophthalmic division of the fifth, and the Ophthalmic Vein. 218 Below the inner end of the Sphenoidal Fissure, and transmits the second division of the fifth pair, viz.: the superior Maxillary Nerve. 219 At the base of each Spinous Process, and transmits the last division of the fifth pair, viz.: the inferior Maxil- lary Nerve, it sometimes transmits theNervus Petrosus Superficialis Minor, and a small Meningeal Artery. 220 Near the apex of each Spinous Process, and transmits the middle Meningeal Artery. 221 Perpendicularly from the base of the greater Wings. 222 The lateral boundaries of the posterior Nares. 223 Into two plates, an external one and an internal one. 224 By its outer surface to part of the origin of the exter- nal Pteiygoid Muscle. 225 In a curved hook, termed the Hamiilar Process, which forms a Pulley around which the Tendon of the Cir- cumflexus vel Tensor Palati plays. 226 The Pterygoid Fossa. 227 The origin of the internal Pterygoid Muscle. 228 The Scaphoid Fossa. 229 The origin of the Tensor Palati Muscle. 230 An angular Notch called the Palatine Notch.

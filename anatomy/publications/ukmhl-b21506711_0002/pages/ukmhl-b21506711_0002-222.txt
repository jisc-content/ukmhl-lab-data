220 ANSWEES TO QUESTIOITS 22 Ko; they frequently open into the common Iliac Vein. 23 Yes; they arise from the Ramueculi on the under sur- face of the Diaphragm. 24 Just below the Renal Vein. 25 Into the left Eenal Vein. 26 The Ovarian. 27 The left. 28 Because it crosses the Aorta, owing to the position of the Vena Cava Inferior. 29 The right into the inferior Cava, and the left into the Eenal Vein. 30 Into the inferior Cava, whilst this Vessel is lodged in the Fissure appropriated to it in the posterior border of the Liver. 31 They commence by a Plexus within each Lobule, which forms an Intralobular Vein, these unite and fonn the larger Veins, Sublobular; and these latter by their convergence ultimately form the Hepatic Veins, which terminate in the inferior Cava. SPINAl VEINS. 32 Into Spinal and Intra-spinal—that is, those situated upon, and those within, the Spinal Column. 33 Into the Petrosal Sinuses. 34 Into three sets, viz: Meningo-rachidian, which form two anterior Longitudinal Vessels, which pass behind the bodies of the Vertebrae, on either side the posterior common Ligament, throughout the whole length of the Spinal Column, and communicate with the Ver- tebral Veins in the Neck, also those of the Dorsal Lumbar and Sacral Veins; a second set—Dorsi-spinal —form a Plexus between the outer Covering of the Cord and the Arches of the Vertebrte, this set opens into the anterior Longitudinal, Vertebral, Intercostal, Lumbar and Sacral Veins; and the third set—MeduUi- spinal—form a Plexus which ultimately open into one Trunk, which divides into two Branches, wliich open one on either side into the lai'ge Longitudinal or Spiaal Veins. THE AZTGOS VEINS. 35 Two, and sometimes three, viz: one on the right side, called Vena Azygos Major; and one, and sometimes two, on the left side. Vena Azygos Minor vel Inferior and Vena Azygos Superior.

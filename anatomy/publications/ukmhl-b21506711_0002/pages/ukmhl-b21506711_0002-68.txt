AXSAVEES TO QUESXIOXS 66 65 Tlie Obturator Artery and l^erve. Section XII.â€”LIGAMENTS OF THE UPPEE EXTBEMITY. 1 The anterior and posterior Stcmo-clavicular, the Inter- clavicular Ligament, the Costo-clavicular or Ehomboid Ligament. 2 Above the Sternum, from the extremity of one Clavicle to that of the other. 3 From the Tubercle on the under surface of the Sternal end of the Clavicle to the CartUage of the first Eib. 4 The superior and inferior Acromio-clavicular Ligaments, the Coraco-clavicular Ligament, Interarticular-fibro- cartilage, and two Synovial Membranes. 5 Two parts, an anterior and a jDosterior, the fonner is called the Trapezoid Ligament, and the latter the Conoid Ligament. 6 The posterior or Coracoid Ligament, and the anterior or Coraco-acromial Ligament. 7 This round Ligament which crosses the ISTotch or Supra- spinal Fossa in the upper Border of the Scapula, and converts it into a Foramen, extends from the base of the Coracoid Process to the Costa, posterior to the Notch. 8 The Supra-scapular Nerve, which is derived from the Brachial Plexus. 9 This triangular Ligament is attached by its apex to the tip of the Acromion Process, and by its base to all the external Border of the Coracoid Process. 10 Because of their attachment from one portion to another portion of the Bone. 11 The Coraco-humeral or Accessory Ligament, the Capsular and Glenoid Ligament, and Synovial Membrane. 12 From the base of the Coracoid Process to the greater Tuberosity of the Os Humeri. 13 This Fibro-cartilaginous Band surrounds the margin of the Glenoid Fossa. 14 The internal and external lateral Ligaments, the anterior and posterior Ligaments. 15 This roundish Band extends from the outer Condyle of the Humenis to the Orbicular Ligament around the Head of the Eadius. 16 This triangular Layer extends from the inner Condyle of the Humeras to the Border of the greater Sigmoid Ca'S'ity of the Ulna. 17 The Ulnar Nerve is in contact "vsith it posteriorly.

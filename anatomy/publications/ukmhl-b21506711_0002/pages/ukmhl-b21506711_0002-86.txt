84 ANSWEES TO QUESTIOyS ?25 A portion of the ijreceding Muscle on its inner side, and so named from its having two fleshy Bellies with a central Tendon. 26 The Rectus Posticus Major et IMinor, Obliquus Inferior et Superior, and the Semi-spinalcs. 27 From the side of the Spinous Process of the Axis, and is inserted into the outer part of the inferior cm-ved line of the Os Occipitis. 28 From the Spinous Process or rather the posterior Tuber- cle of the Atlas, and is inserted into the inferior cui-ved line of the Os Occipitis, and between this ridge and the Foramen Magnum, 29 From the Spinous Process of the Axis, and is inserted into the extremity of the Transverse Process of the Atlas. 30 At the termination of the preceding Muscle, and is in- serted into the rough impression between the two curved lines of the Os Occipitis, near the Mastoid Process. 31 From the Transverse Processes of the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth Dorsal Vertebrae, and is inserted into the Spinous Processes of the four upper Dorsal and two last Cervical Vertebrte. 32 From the Transverse Processes of four or five upper Dorsal Vertebrne and ai'tictilar processes of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh Cenical Vertebrae, and is inserted into the Spinous Processes of the second, third, fourth, and fifth Cei'vical Vertebrae. 3:3 TheInter-spinales, Multifidus Spinse, Inter-transversales, and Levatores Costarum. 34 These Muscles, as their name implies, are placed between the Spinous Processes of the adjoining paii's of "\^er- tebrse, they exist in the thi-ee Regions, viz.: the Cer- vical, Dorsal, and Lumbar, but not so distinct in the two last-named Regions, in the Cervical Region they are well observed, attached above and below to the Bifid extremities of the Spinous Processes, except between the first and second Cei-vical VertebriE. 35 These fleshy Fasciculi extend from the Sacrum to the second Vertebra; in the Lumbar Region each Fasci- culus ai-ises from the accessory and articular- processes of the Lumbal- VertebrfE; in the Dorsal fi-om the Transverse Processes of the coiTesponding Vertebrae, and in the Cervical from the articular processes of

155 ON HUMAN ANATOMY. Granular contents (contaiaiing the Grannies of the Pigmentuni Nigmm) wHch. are so disposed as to resemble a mosaic appeai'ance. 55 The external Layer. 56 The middle or Arterial Layer (Tunica Euyschiana) which is reflected inwai-ds at its junction with the Ciliary Ligament. 57 A Professor of Anatomy at Amsterdam in 1665, who, previous to his death {cet. 98), came to the conclusion that the Body was entirely made up of Vessels. 58 No; hut replaced by a Layer of Fibrous Tissue of the Choroid of metallic brilliancy, called the Tapetum. 59 No; its absence gives the red colour to the Iris & Pupil. 60 To absorb the superabun'dant rays of light entering the Globe of the Eye. 61 These Processes or Folds are formed by the reflection of the anterior margins of the middle Coat of the Choroid, which is drawn up as it were into a series of delicate Folds or Plaits, whose aggregate forms a complete circle around the Lens, hence called by Anatomists Corpus Ciliare vel Corona Ciliaris. 62 About four score. 63 Triangular. 64 The Ciliary Ligament. 65 It is free, and rests against the circumference of the Lens. 66 With a Layer of Pigmentum ISTigmm. 67 Of a whitish colour. 68 ITo, they vary, consisting of larger and smaller Folds. 69 The Suspensory Ligament of the Lens on the front of the Vitreous Humour. 70 Into Grooves or HoUows between the Folds on the anterior aspect of the Hyaloid Membrane of the Vitreous Humour. 71 The narrow whitish circle (Annulus Albidus) which is attached to the inner surface of the Sclerotic at its junction with the Cornea. 72 The bond of Tinion between the external and middle Coats of the Eye. 73 The Choroid Coat. 74 The Iris. 75 The Ciliary Vessels and Nerves. 76 A minute Groove. 77 A minute Canal, called the Ciliary Canal or Canal of Fontana.

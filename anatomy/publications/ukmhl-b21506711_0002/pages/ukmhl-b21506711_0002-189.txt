187 ON HUMAN ANATOMY. 14 The superior Thyroid, Lingual, and Tacial. 15 The Occipital, posterior Auricular, and Mastoid. 16 The ascending Phai-yngeal, transverse Tacial, Parotidean, Temporal, and internal Maxillary. 17 From the inner side of the external Carotid Artery, just below the Cornu of the Os Hyoides; and is distributed to the Thyi-oid Gland. 18 The Hyoid, superior Laryngeal, inferior Laryngeal (or Crico-thyroid,) and Muscular (or Sterno-mastoid) Branches. 19 This is the second Branch of the external Carotid which is distiibuted to the Muscles of the Os Hyoides and Tongue, also the Sublingual Gland, and ultimately terminates in the Kanine Artery. 20 The Hyoid, DorsaHs Lingute, and Sub-lingual. 21 The inferior Palatine, the Glandular, Sub-mental, Ptery- goid, inferior Labial, the two Coronary, the Lateral Nasal, and the Terminal or angular Branch at the inner angle of the Orbit. 22 The posterior Meningeal to the Dura Mater, and the Kamus Princeps Cervicis. 23 The Foramen Lacerum Posterius. 24 Through the medium of the Eamus Princeps Cervicis. 25 The Stylo-mastoid, which enters the internal Ear through the Stylo-mastoid Foramen; another small Branch is given off to supply the Occipito-frontalis. 26 The Stemo-mastoid Muscle and Cervical Glands. 27 The ascending Pharyngeal. 28 The Meningeal, which enters the Skull through the Foramen Lacerum Posterius to be distributed to the Dura Mater; and the Pharyngeal Branch, which supplies the Muscular structure of the Pharynx, Ton- sils, Soft Palate, and Eustachian Tube. 29 The middle Temporal, Orbital, anterior Auricular, and Parotid Branches, each of which are distributed as their names imply. 30 One of the Terminal Branches of the external Carotid Artery. 31 In two Branchesâ€”an anterior and a posterior; the anterior or Frontal Branch supplies the Forehead and sides, and the posterior or Occipital Branch supplies the Occiput. 32 The anterior Branch, which inosculates with the Supra- orbital of the Ophthalmic.

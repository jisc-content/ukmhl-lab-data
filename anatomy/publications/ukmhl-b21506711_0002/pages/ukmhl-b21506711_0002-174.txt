COCHLEA. 166 Immediately before the Vestibule. 167 Pyramidal; with its base directed towards the Meatus Auditorius Internus, and its apex towards the upper and anterior part of the inner Wall of the T3Tnpanum opposite the Canal for the Tensor Tympani. 168 Nearly three Coils. 169 Left to right. 170 Right to left. 171 About one inch-and-a-half. 172 In a closed extremity, called the Cupola. 173 The first. 174 The Promontory on the inner WaU of the Tympanum. 175 Into two Passages (Scalae) by means of a thia Lamina or Septum of Bone, which, by being prolonged by a Membrane to the opposite "Wall of the Cochlea, con- stitutes a complete Septum (Lamina Spii-alis). 176 Osseous and Membranous ; the former consists of two thin Osseous Lamina), which are porous, transmitting

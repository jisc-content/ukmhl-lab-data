150 AirSWEES TO atTESTIONS the Spennatic of the Male) from the front of the Aorta, just below the superior Mesenteric. 350 Into the Uterine Plexuses. 351 They are very large, and in the impregnated state of the organ are called Sinuses, consisting, within its substance, of Canals, and lined only by the internal Membrane of the Veins. 353 From the Sympathetic System (the Hypogastric and' Spermatic Plexuses), and from the Sacral Plexus by an interlacement of its Visceral Nerves with the Branches of the Hypogastric Plexus. TAILOPIAN TUBES. 353 Two small worm-like Tubes, which convey the Ova from the Ovaria to the "Uterus, and called by some the Excretory Ducts of the Ovaria. 354 Each is situated in the upper border of the Broad Ligament (Ligamentum Latum), extending from the upper angle of the Uterus to the lateral part of the Pelvis, where it terminates in abroad and free extrem- ity, which is divided into a number of irregular Processes or Fringes (Pimbrise), Kke the mouth of a Trumpet. 355 No; one of these Processes is longer than the rest, and it is to this Process that the corresponding Ovarium is attached. 356 It is supposed to guide or direct the Tube to the Ovarium, so that its expanded Fimbriated extremity shall embrace the surface of the Ovary when under the influence of impregnation. 357 A Fissure or Groove (Ostium Abdominale) into which the impregnated Ovum is received and conducted to the Orifice of the Fallopian Tube. 358 About four inches in length, and somewhat irregular in its coiu'se. 359 No; its Aperture into the Uterus (Ostium Uterinum) is the smallest part, and increases towards its outer extremity. 360 Similar to that of the Uterus, it is composed of a Mus- cular Coat, aMucous Coat, and an external or Peritoneal Investment. 361 Longitudinally and circularly. 362 The longitudinal, but both Layers of Fibres are con- tinuous vrith those of the Uterus. 363 Longitudinal Folds or Rugis.

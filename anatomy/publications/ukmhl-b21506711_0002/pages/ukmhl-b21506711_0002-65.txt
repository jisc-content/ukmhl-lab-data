ON HUMAN ANATOMY. 63 LIGAMENTS OF THE TRUNK. 9 Into seven groups; those of the Vertebral Column, of the Cranium, of the lower Jaw, of the Eibs with the VertebroD, of the Eibs with the Ste]mxm and with each other, of the Vertebral Column with the Pelvis, and of the Pelvis. ARTICULATIONS 01" THE SPINE. 10 The anterior and posterior common Ligament and the Inter-vertebral substance. 11 Prom the Atlas to the Sacrum. V2 This Ligament, situated within the Spinal Canal and attached to the posterior surfaces of the bodies of the Vertebrte, extends from the Atlas to the Sacrum. 13 These circular Discs ai'e situated between the contiguous surfaces of the bodies of the Vertebrte, connected with the anterior and posterior common Ligaments, and laterally with the Stellate or anterior Costo-vertebral Ligaments of the Heads of the Eibs. 14 Ligamenta Subflava, which extend from the Axis to the Sacrum. 15 Capsular Ligaments which enclose each a Synovial Membrane. 16 Supra-spinous and Inter-spinous Ligaments. 17 These strong Pibrous Bands are attached to the summits of the Spinous Processes, throughout the Dorsal and Lumbar Vertebrae. 18 The Ligamentum Nuchee. 19 These thin and Membranous-like Ligaments extend from the Eoot to the summit of each Spinous Process, con- necting the lower Border of one with the upper Bor- der of the next below it. 20 Inter-transverse Ligaments. S1 These thin and Membranous-like Ligaments exist chiefly in the Dorsal Vertebrae. AB,TICULATIONS OF THE CRANIUM:. 22 The anterior (Occipito-atloid) Ligament, the posterior (Occipito-atloid) Ligament, and two Capsular Liga- ments. 23 Prom the Basilar Process of the Os Occipitis, in front of the Foramen Magnum to the Body and anterior Tubercle of the Atlas. 24 Unlike the anterior it extends from the margin of the Os Occipitis, behind the Foramen Magnum to the ante- rior arch of the Atlas.

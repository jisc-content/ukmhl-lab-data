138 AKTSWEES TO QUESTIONS 102 A small piece of the Gland, which extends transversely between the lateral Lobes at the base of the organ. 103 The middle Lobe. 104 The centre of the posterior paxt or base. 105 At the base and apex. 106 Obliquely. 107 A section of the Gland presents a reddish colour, and its substance is composed of Fibrous and Muscular Tissue interspersed with Glandidar structure; amicros- copic examination gives it a CcUular appearance, owing to the minute Duets ramifying in it, and which terminate in Lobules. 108 It forms about one thii'd of the Gland. 109 No, they vary in number from fifteen to twenty, which open in the Prostatic portion of the Urethra on either side the Veru Montanum. 110 Two: a Fibrous and Muscular Coat. 111 Circularly. 112 Yes, it obtains one from the Kecto-vesical Fascia. 113 From Branches derived from the anterior Trunk of the internal Iliac Artery, viz: the middle HEemorrhoidal and the lower Vesical. 114 A Plexus, which commimicates anteriorly with the Dorsal Vein of the Penis; and posteriorly with a Plexus at the base of the Bladder. VESICUL^ SEMINALES. 115 Two small Membranous Sacs situated at the under surface of the Bladder, between its base and the Rectum. 116 About two inches in length, and of a Pyramidal form. 117 The base of the Bladder. lis The Eectum; the Eecto-vesical Fascia intervening. 119 A triangular space. 120 By the divergence of the Vesicula3 fi'om each other posteriorly, and their convergence anteriorly at the Prostate Gland. 121 By the Eocto-vesical Fold of Peritoneum. 122 The Trigonum Vesicae on the inner sm-face of the Bladder. 123 Formed by the convolution of a single Tube, which gives off laterally several Csecal Branches or Pouches, which are united together by Fibrous Tissue. 124 Two: an external or Fibrous Coat, which is derived from the Pelvic Fascia; and an internal one, analogous to Mucous Membrane. 125 In a closed exti-emity.

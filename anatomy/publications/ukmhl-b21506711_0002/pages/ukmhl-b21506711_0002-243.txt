FALX CEEEBELLI. 24 Between the Lobes of the Cerebellum. 25 It descends from the middle of the under surface of the Tentorium, along the vertical ridge of the Os Occipitis to the Foramen Magnum. 26 The Hemispheres or Lobes of the Cerebellum. 27 Triangulai-, with its base dii-ected to the Tentorium Cerebelli and its apex downwards. 28 The Occipital Sinuses. AETERIES AND NEEVES OP THE DTJEA MATER. 29 Into anterior, middle and posterior Meningeal. 30 Trom the Ethmoidal Branches of the Ophthalmic, which last-named Artery is derived from the internal Carotid. 31 The Dura Mater at the base of the Skull, near the Eth- moid Bone. 32 Two of these Branches are derived from the internal Maxillary, which last-named Artery is derived from the external Carotid, and the third is derived from the ascending Pharyngeal, also a Branch of the ex- ternal Carotid. 33 The last of these three Branches supplies the Dura Mater in the middle Eossa, and the Dura Mater on the upper surface and sides are also supplied by the larger of these middle Meningeal Branches. 34 Erom the Occipital and Vertebral Arteries; the former derived from the external Carotid, and the latter from the Subcla-vian Artery. 35 The Dura Mater in the posterior Fosste of the Os Occipitis. 36 Their source is somewhat irregular; Branches are derived from the Sympathetic, also from some of the Cranial j^ierves, viz : the Ophthalmic or fifth, and sometimes from the Pathetic or fourth Nerve. PIA IkLATEE. 37 The Vascular Membrane which surrounds and closely invests the Cerebral Mass, passing into its Fissures and Depressions. 38 Yes; forming the Velum Interpositum and Choroid Plexuses. 39 It presents, from its extreme Vascularity, a net-work of Blood-vessels, which are held together by a thin Layer of Cellular Tissue.

13 ON HUMAN ANATOMY. 132 The seventh paii' of Nerves. 133 A vertical ridge of Bone which divides it into two unequal pai-ts, a superior and inferior. 134 The comniencement of the Aqueduct of Fallopius. 135 The racial Nerve, (Portio Dui-a). 136 At the Stylo-mastoid Foramen, where the same Nerve makes its exit, and where a small Artery the Stylo- mastoid is admitted to the Tympanum. It (the Aqueduct of Tallopius) also receives the Vidian Nerve through the medium of the Hiatus Pallopii. 137 Several minute Eoramina through which the Filaments of the Auditory Nerve, (the Vestibular), reach the internal Ear. 138 Aquceductus Vestibuli vel CanaKs Cotuimii. 139 A small Artery and Vein, also a small portion of the Dura Mater. 140 A Conical Pit or Possa which forms a minute Canal, called Aquseductus Cochleae, for the passage of small Vessels. 141 Kough and irregular. 142 The Styloid process. 143 Downwards and forwards and about one inch in length, (the one before me is one inch and a-half,) it gives attachment to two Ligaments, (the Stylo-hyoid and Stylo-maxillary Ligaments), and the origins of three Muscles. 144 Stylo-pharyngeus, Stylo-hyoideus, and Stylo-glossus. 145 A rough sheath-like indentation or ridge, called the Vaginal process. 146 It is the continuation of the Lamella of Bone which forms the back part of the Glenoid Cavity. 147 The Stylo-mastoid Poramen. 148 The Jugular Possa. 149 The Poramen Lacerum Posterius. 150 The internal Jugular Vein. 151 The Carotid Canal, which transmits the internal Carotid Artery into the Skull. 152 At the Apex. 153 The origins of the Tensor Tympani and Levator Palati. 154 The Tympanic Branch of the Glosso-pharyngeal or Jacobson's Nerve. 155 A Branch of the Par-vagum, (Arnold's Nerve). 156 The Apex, and called Poramen Lacerum Medium. 157 The Tentorium CcrebeUi.

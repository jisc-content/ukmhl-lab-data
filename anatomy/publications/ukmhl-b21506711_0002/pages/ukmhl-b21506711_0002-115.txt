113 ox HUMAN ANATOMY. 109 Pai'tially concave, to receive the convex surface of the Heai't. 110 Incompletely into two Lobes by a long and oblique Fissure, ivhich extends from the posterior part near the apex to the anterior border near the base. 111 Its upper Lobe is sub-divided by a second Fissiu-e, which marks off a small triangular piece called the third Lobe of the same Lung; the right Lung is also larger and heavier than the left. 112 The left. 113 By their Eoots, which consist of the Pulmonary and Bronchial Vessels, the Bronchial Tubes, and Plexuses of Jferves. â€¢ 114 Midway between the base and apex. 115 Of a spongy texture, consisting of an immense number of minute Cells, in which the ultimate ramifications of the Air Tube terminate. 116 No; each is distinct, being provided with its own Air Tube, Vessels, and Nerves. 117 ThePleuree. 118 Two : one for each Lung. 119 The Pleiu-a CostaHs. 120 The Pleura Puhnonalis. 121 The Mediastinum. 122 The Heart. 123 No; it is only one Septum which extends from the Sternum to the Spine. 124 The divisions of the Air Tube or Trachea. 125 In structure similar to the Trachea. 126 The left, which is about two inches long. 127 ObHquely downwards and outwards beneath the Aortic Arch, entering the left Lung at about the middle of its root, where it first divides into two Branches, one for each Lobe, they then divide and sub-divide into their ultimate terminations, forming the minute Bronchial Cells. 128 About one inch in length, passing forwards and out- wards above the Arch of the right Pulmonary Artery, and entering the right Lung opposite the fourth Dorsal Vertebra. 129 From before backwards; the most anterior are the Pul- monary Veins; the most posterior, the Bronchus, and between the two is the Pulmonary Artery.

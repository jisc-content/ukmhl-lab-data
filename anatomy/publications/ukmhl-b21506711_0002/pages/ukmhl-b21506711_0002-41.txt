OK nuMAIf, ANATOMY. 89' 26 DejDressions or Grooves, one of which, gives insertion to some of the Miiscular Fibres of the Siib-scapnlaris, another just below the Glenoid Cavity to the middle or long Head of the Ti-iceps Cubiti. 27 At the upper thii-d of the posteiior Border, and ter- minates in the Acromion Process. 28 The origin of a portion of the Deltoid, and the insertion of a portion of the Trapezius. 29 The broad, flat, and arch-like elongated process of the Spine which overhangs the Glenoid Cavity. 30 Its anterior Border. 31 The anterior, superior, and inferior. 32 This angle, the strongest part of the Bone forms the Head. 33 An oval and shallow articular surface called the Glenoid Cavity, which is broader below than above. 34 By a Eim of Eibro-cartilage. 35 By the junction of the posterior Border or base with the superior Border of the Scapula. 36 By the junction of the posterior Border or base with the inferior Border of the Scapiila. 37 The Latissimas Dorsi. 38 The Neck is the narrow constricted part at the conver- gence of the superior and infe.i-ior Borders, imme- diately behind the Glenoid Cavity. 39 The round, thick,, and cuiwed projection nearly two inches in length, which arises by a broad base from the upper pai t of the Neck of the Scapula, overhang- ing the Glenoid Cavity on the inner side. 40 The origins of the Coraco-brachialis and short Head of the Biceps. 41 The insertion of the Pectoralis Minor. 42 Two; with the Humerus by its Glenoid Cavity, audi with the Clavicle by its Acromion Process. 43 From the superior Border just behind the Supra-scapu-. lar Notch. 44 Six: one for the Body, two for the Acromion, one for â–  the Coracoid Process, one for the inferior angle, and one for the base. CLAVICLE. 45 This Bone, so called from its resemblance to an ancient key, is situated at the upper and anterior part of the. Thorax, extending horizontally from the Scapula to the Sternum.

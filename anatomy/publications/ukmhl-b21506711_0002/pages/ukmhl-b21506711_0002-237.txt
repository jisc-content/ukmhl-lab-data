ON HTBIAIT ANATOMY. 235 81 By slicing a portion of either Hemisphere to the level of the Corpus Callosiim, a larger white central sub- stance will present itself (also surrounded by a margin of grey matter), this is the Centrum Ovale Majus. FOENIX, 82 The thin triangular and horizontal LameUa of white matter situated beneath the Corpus Callosiim. 83 Part of the Floor of the lateral Ventricles. 84 In two Crura or Pillars, which arch downwards at the forepart of the lateral Ventricle, to terminate in the Corpora Pisiformia. 86 Each forms a narrow white or Medullary Baud, called Corpus Pimbriatiim (Taenia Hippocampi). 86 Pascia Dentata. 87 Hippocampus Major et Minor. 88 Lp-a. 89 Poramen of Munro. sEPTTJiu: LTrciDtnu:. 90 The thin semi-transparent partition between the lateral Ventricles. 91 Two thin Layers of white Cerebral Matter. 92 The fifth Ventricle. 9 3 This white cord-like Pasciculus, which passes through the Corpus Striatum on either side, connects the two Hemispheres (the anterior and middle Lobes.) 94 This layer of Grey Matter connects the corresponding sides of the two Optic Thalami. 95 This white cord-like Pasciculus connects the two Optic Thalami posteriorly. 96 Poramen Commune Anterins. 97 Iter ad Infundibulum. 98 Poramen Commune Posterius. 99 Iter a Tertio ad Quartum Ventriculum.

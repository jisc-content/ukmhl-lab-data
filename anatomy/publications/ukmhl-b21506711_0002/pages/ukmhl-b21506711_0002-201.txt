199 OK HUMAN AKATOMY. 4 The Coronary (Coronaria Ventriculi). 5 It passes upwards between the two Layers of the lesser Omentum to the left or Cardiac Orifice of the Stomach, it then turns to the right, running along the upper or lesser ciu've of the Stomach to its Pyloric extremity, where it anastomoses with the Pyloric Branch of the Hepatic Artery. 6 (Esophageal, Splenic, and Gastric Branches. 7 This Artery, in its course to the Liver, pusses upwards along the right border of the little Omentum, and divides near the transverse Pissui'e into two terminal Branches—the right and left Hepatic Branches, which latter supply the substance of the Liver. 8 The Pyloric, the right Gastro-epiploic (Gastro-epiploica Dexti'a), and the tenninal or right and left Hepatic Branches. 9 It inosculates with the Coronary Artery. 10 The Pancreatico-diiodenal, superior and inferior Pyloric. 11 It inosculates with the left Gastro-epiploic Branch of the Splenic Artery. 12 It inosculates with a small Branch from the superior Mesenteric Artery (the inferior Pancreatico-duodenal Branch). 13 The Cystic Ai-tery. 14 From its origin to its division into the Pancreatico- duodenal Branch. 15 The Splenic. 16 It runs transversely along the upper border of the Pan- creas to the left side. 17 It divides into six or eight Terminal Branches, which enter the substance of the Spleen, to which they are dist-ributed; from the circumstance of the Splenic Tissue being so soft, it is extremely difficult to trace them to their terminations. 18 The Pancreatic, the left Gastro-epiploic (Arteria Gastro- epiploica Sinistra), and the Vasa Previa. 19 To the Pancreatic Gland, and one—the Arteria Pan- creatica Magna—accompanies the Duct through the substance of the Gland. 20 This Branch, larger than the rest, appears to be contin- uous with the Splenic Artery; it inosculates with the Gastro-epiploica Dextra of the Hepatic Artery, and supplies the anterior and posterior surfaces of the Stomach and Greater Omentum.

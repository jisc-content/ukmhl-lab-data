56 AirSWEES TO QTTESTIOIfS OS CALCIS. 134 At the posterior and inferior part of the Tarsus, 135 Into four surfaces (superior, inferior, internal, and ex- ternal), and two extremities (anterior and posterior). 136 Two ai-ticular surfaces; the posterior, which is the largest, is convex, and the anterior somewhat concave. 137 Those of the Astragalus. 138 The Interosseous Ligament. 189 By its union with the corresponding one ia the Astragalus, (Canalis Tarsi). 140 Eough and convex, and presents posteriorly two Tubercles, (an external and iatemal one, the latter the largest). 141 The origin of the superficial Plantar Muscles and the thick Plantar Pascia. 142 Deeply concave for the passage of the Plantar or Plexor Tendons, Vessels and Nerves. 143 Sustentaculum Tali, which assists to support the anterior articular siu'face or Head of the Astragalus. 144 The Calcaneo-scaphoid or inferior elastic Ligament. 145 The Tendons of the Plexor Longus PoUicis, and Plexor Longus Digitorum Pedis. 146 Broad, somewhat convex and sub-cutaneous, and marked near its middle by two small Grooves divided by a Tubercle. 147 The Tendons of the Peroneus Longus et Brevis. 148 A smooth articular sm'face which corresponds with the Os Cuboides. 149 The origin of the Extensor Brevis Digitorum. 150 This extremity, which forms the Heel, is convex and presents two surfaces, an upper and a lower; in the upper and smooth part is situated, between the Tendo Achillis and the Bone, a Bursa; and the lower or rough part indicates the insertion of the Tendo Achillis. 151 Two; the Astragalus and Os Cuboides. 152 Eight; the conjoined Tendon of the Soleus and Gas- trocnemius, conjointly with the Plantaris Tendon, Abductor PoUicis, Abductor Minimi Digiti, Plexor Brevis Digitomm, Plexor Accessorius, and the Ex- tensor Brevis Digitonim Pedis. OS SCAPHOIDES. 153 At the inner Border of the Tarsus between the Astragalus and Ossa Cunciformia.

30 AWSTTEHS TO QtTESTIOXS 54 They arc almost vertical; the upper look directly back- â– wards, and the lower directly forwards. 55 Almost round, each decreasing in size from the first to the tenth. 56 The body of this Bone has an articular surface for the Head of the first Eib, and a smaller one for only half of that of the second Eib. 57 Each have only a single entire articulate surface for the last two llibs, as their transverse processes which are very small, have no articulating siu'faces for the Eibs. 58 From the circumstance of the inferior articulating siu'- faces looking outwards, like those of the Lumbar Vertebra). XTJMBAE VEKTEBItiE. 69 Large, oval, and broad; the greatest diameter being from side to side, unlike a Dorsal Vertebra, the ver- tical depth is greater before than behind, the edges are somewhat prominent. 60 These processes are long and slender, flattened anteriorly and posteriorly, increasing in length from first to third, and then diminish to the fifth. 61 This process is short, straight, and broad, on either side; naiTow above and below; the last is the shortest and sometimes divided like the one noAV before me. 63 These processes are vertical and sfrong, the superior concave and facing each other, the inferior somewhat convex and directed forwards and outwards. 63 Triangidar with rounded angles. 64 Generally fiity-two pairs. BONES OF THE THOEA.X. 65 By the Dorsal Vertebra) posteriorly, the Kibs laterally, and the Stemiun anteriorly. 66 Transversely on either side the Thorax. 67 Twenty-foiu-: twelve on either side. 68 Into two classes, true and false. 69 The upper seven on cither side constitute the true Eibs. 7 0 Because they are each tmited to the Sternum by Caiiilage. 71 Into two siu-faces (external and internal), two borders and two extremities. 72 Convex and smooth, and marked for the attachment of Muscles. 73 Flat and concave. 74 Hounded and smooth, and gives attachment to the Intercostal Muscles.

ANSWEES TO QTTESTIONS 24S 40 By the Eamusculi of the Cerebral Aiteries and Veins. 41 By the Pia-mater; the inner or Visceral Surface giving off the minute Nutritive Vessels. 42 Erom the two internal Carotid and twoVertehral Arteries. 43 From the minute Offsets of the Sympathetic; and it is conjectured by one or two Anatomists that some Cranial Nerves furnish minute Filaments to it. AEACHNOID MEMBEANE. 44 The fine Serous Membrane which not only lines the Brain, but is also reflected over the inner surface of the Dura Mater. 45 Into two parts : an external or Parietal and an internal or Visceral. 46 The Dura Mater and its Processes, to which it is insepar- ably connected. 47 The Encephalon, to which it is loosely connected by Cellular Tissue. 48 The Sub-arachnoidean Space. 49 No; but passes over them. 50 It is closely united posteriorly with the Pons Varolii and inferior surface of the Cerebellum. 51 The Sub-arachnoidean Fluid. 52 It is almost extra-vascular. 53 If present they have hitherto eluded, by the aid of the Microscope, the researches of the Anatomist. Section LIILâ€”SPINAL CORD. 1 That portion of the Cerebro-spinal Mass which is enclosed in the Vertebral Canal. 2 From the lower border of the Pons Varolii, opposite the level of the Atlas, to the upper border of the second Lumbar Vertebra. 3 From sixteen to eighteen inches in length, and somewhat cylindrical. 4 No; but presents in its extent two enlargements, corres- ponding to the origin of the Spinal Nerves; the first or upper one opposite the last three or four Cervical Vertebrae, and the other opposite the last two Dorsal Vertebrae. 5 Yes; in the upper, the Cord is wider firom side to side than before backwards, and vice-versa with the lower enlargement. 6 A Median Longitudinal Fissure, which divides each surface into two lateral halves.

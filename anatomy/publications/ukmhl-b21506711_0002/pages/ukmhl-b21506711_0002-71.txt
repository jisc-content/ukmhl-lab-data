Olf HUMAN Al^ATOMT. 69 Fibro-Ccortilages (one internal, the other external), the Transverse Ligament, also a Synovial Membrane. 9 This strong cord-like Ligament extends from the outer Condyle of the Femur, behind the Tubercle, to the outer part of the Head of the Fibula, this Ligament is sometimes called the long external lateral Ligament, in contradistinction to one which sometimes exists behind it, and called the short external lateral Liga- ment. 10 This broad Ligamentous Layer extends from the Tubercle on the inner Condyle of the Femur to the inner Tu- berosity of the Tibia, on its liosterior Border. 11 Chiefly by the Tendinous Fibres of the Semimembranosus Muscle. 12 The Ligamentum PateUce of the Extensor Muscles of the Thigh, it is erroneously called a Ligament, being only a prolongation of the common Extensor Tendon. 13 A Bursa Mucosa. 14 From the depression in front of the Spine of the Tibia to the posterior part of the external Condyle of the Femur, on its inner siu-face. 15 From the depression behind the Spine of the Tibia to the inner Condyle of the Femur. 16 Oval. 17 Circular. 18 This narrow band is situated in front of the Joint between the two Interarticular Cartilages. 19 The anterior and posterior Ligaments and the Inter- osseous Ligament, 20 From the inner Tuberosity of the Tibia to the anterior pai't of the Head of the Fibula. 21 From the corresponding parts upon the posterior surface of the Joint. 22 This broad, thin, fibrous Layer is attached to the con- tiguous margins of the Tibia and Fibula, forming a partial Septiun between the anterior aad posterior Muscles of the Leg. 23 The anterior Tibial Artery, which forms one of the divi- sions of the Popliteal Artery. 24 The anterior Peroneal Branch, which according to some Anatomists is derived from the Peroneal or Fibular Artery. 25 The anterior and posterior Ligaments and the inferior or Transverse Ligament.

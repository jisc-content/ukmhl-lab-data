ON HintfAN ANATOMY. P39 before or behind, and flattened from above downwards. 3 Like the Cerebiiim, into two Hemispheres. 4 This surface is not marked with Convolutions, but by- parallel Laminae, which are separated by Sulci or Fissures. 5 Convex. 6 Like the Cerebrum, it consists of two substancesâ€”an external or Cortical, and an internal or Medullary substance. 7 By making a vertical section of the Cerebellum, the Medullaiy or white substance within the Cortical would present the appearance of a tree with numerous Branches, hence the designation "Arbor Yitae." 8 By a Fissure or Sulcus, wliich lodges the Falx CerebelH. 9 By two Projections, fonned by the Yenniform Processes. ] 0 The superior Yermiform Process. 11 Along the middle line, and acting as the superior Com- missure, serves to connect the two Hemispheres. 12 The inferior Yermiform Process, which serves to con- nect the two Hemispheres on the under surface. 13 The Uvula, Nodule, Tonsil, and Pyramid or Flocculus. 14 By three pairs or Peduncles of Medullary Fasciculi. 15 Processus e CerebcUo ad Testes, Corpora Eestiformia, and Crura Cerebelli. PEOCESSTJS E CEEEBELLO AD TESTES. 16 The superior Peduncles of the Cerebellum. 17 Each is continuous with the inferior Yermiform Process behind, and terminate in the Optic Thalamus and Crus Cerebri of each Hemisphere. 18 The Yalve of Yieussens. 19 Pai-t of the lateral boundaries of the fourth Yentricle. COEPOEA EESTIFOEMIA. 20 The inferior Peduncles of the Cerebellum, and form here only part of the Corpora Bestiformia. 21 The Medulla Oblongata with the Cerebellum. CETTEA CEEEBELLI. 22 The middle Peduncles of the Cerebellum. 23 The terminal transverse Fibres of the Pons Varolii or Great Commissure of the Cerebellum. 24 In the lateral parts of the Cerebellum, and pass forwards to the Pons Yarolii, where they form the Transverse Fibres.

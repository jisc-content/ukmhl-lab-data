Section XIX.â€”PASCIiE. 1 Fascise are Membranous investments distributed through the various Eegions of the body for the puipose of investing or protecting the Muscles and more delicate parts. 2 Into three classes; Cellular Fasciae, CeUulo-fibrous Fasciae, and Tendino-fibrous Fasciae. 3 The supei-ficial Fascia is a Cellular investment which exists throughout the Body, immediately beneath the Skin and fonns the connecting medium between it and the deeper parts of the body. 4 Similar to Cellular Fasciae, with the exception that it is free from Adipose Tissue in its structure. 5 Fasciaj of the Xeck, Thoracic Fasciae, also the Sheaths of Vessels. 6 The strongest, the most inelastic and unyielding of the three kinds of investing Membrane. 7 The Fasciae of the Pelvis, Knee, Elbow, "Wrist, &c, 8 Like the Muscles; into those of the Head and Neck, the Trunk, the upper extremity and the lower ex- tremity. 9 TheTcmporal Fasciae, Superficial & deep Cervical Fascia).

ANSWEES TO QUESTIONS 194 AXIILARY ARTEEIES. 61 Two : one for each upper extremity. 62 These Arteries form the continuation of the Subclavian Arteries through the Axillary Spaces to the upper Exti-emities, extending from the lower border of the first Rib to the lower borders of the Latissimus Dorsi and Teres Major Muscles. 63 Downwards, outwards, and backwards. 64 In the Brachial, on either side. 65 The Pectoral Muscles, and Costo-coracoid Ligament. 66 The first Intercostal Muscles, and first digitation of the Serratus Magnus, Axillary Vein, and the long Thoracic Nerve (external Eespiratory of Sir C. BeU). 67 The Coraco-brachialis and Brachial Plexus. 68 The superior Thoracic, Acromial Thoracic, inferior or long Thoracic (or external Mammary), Subscapular, the two Circumflex Branches (anterior and posterior), the inferior Acromial, and the Alar or Axillary Thoracic. 69 The Pectoral Muscles. 70 Its Branches inosculate with the Intercostal Branches. 71 To the Pectoral and Deltoid Muscles. 72 Its Branches inoscidate with the Intercostal Branches. 73 To the Pectoral and Serratus Muscles. 74 Its Branches inosculate with the Intercostal Branches. '75 It distributes Branches to the Mammary Gland. 76 J'rom the Axillary, near the lower border of the Sub- Bcapi^r cIkj^ ^ ^^.^ ] 77 To the Serraiais 3itag5as, Teres Major, and Latissimus Dorsi Muscles. 78 It gives ofi^ a Branch to the Dorsum Scapulae. 79 It inosculates with the Supra-scapular and posterior Scapular Arteries. 80 The posterior. 81 The Deltoid Muscle and Shoulder Joint. 82 Its Branches inosculate with the anterior Circumflex and Supra-scapular Arteries. 83 To the Deltoid Muscle and Shoulder Joint. 84 Its Branches inosculate with the posterior Circumflex. 85 It pierces the Deltoid Muscle and inosculates on the Acromion Process with one of the Supra-scapular Branches. 86 This Branch, which often arises from one of the other Thoracic Branches, is distributed to the Glands and Cellular Tissue in the AxiUary Space.

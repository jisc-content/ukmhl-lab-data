29 ON HUMAN ANATOMY. 36 The transverse Ligament which confines the Pivot or Odontoid process of the Axis in its proper sphere. 37 Ten pairs: Longus et Splenitis Colli, Eectus Anticus Minor, Rectus Posticus Minor, Eectus Lateralis, Obliquus Superior et Inferior, Levator Anguli Scapiilae, the fijrst Inter-transversalis, and the fijst Inter-spinous. AXIS. 88 So called from having a process on which the Head turns. 39 The Odontoid process. 40 Two; one coiTesponding with the articulating surface on the anterior surface or Arch of the Atlas, and the other or posterior for the transverse Ligament. 41 Plat, circular, and almost horizontal. 42 Oblique, and look downwards and outwards. 43 Very short, directed downwards, perforated obliquely, and neither grooved nor bifiu'cated. 44 Larger, broader, and more bifurcated. 45 Convex. 46 Eleven pairs: Longus et Splenius Colli, Eectus Posticus Major, Semi-spinalis Colli, Inter-spinalis, Multifidus Spinae, Inter-transversalis, Transversalis Colli, Obli- quus Inferior, Scalenus Posticus, and Levator Anguli Scapulae. 47 Vertebra Prominens, so called from its long Spinous Process. 48 Similar to the upper Dorsal Vertebra. 49 The Ligamentum Nuchae. 50 They are longer and broader, not invariably perforated, nor are they grooved. nOESAL VEETEBE.J:. 51 The body is most convex anteriorly, the vertical depth is greater behind than before, the upper and lower surfaces almost flat, and the two articular surfaces on either side correspond with those on the Heads of the Eibs, the lower of which are the largest, and the , Articular Cavity for the Head of the Eib is formed by the Articular Cups of two Vertebrae. 53 Thick, strong, and directed obliquely downwards; on either side anteriorly is an articulating surface, for a corresponding Eib. 63 Long and considerably inclined downwards, so as to overlap its fellow below.

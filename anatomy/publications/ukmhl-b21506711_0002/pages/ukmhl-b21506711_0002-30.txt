ANSTVEES TO QTTESTIOITS 28 18 The two superior are directed upwards from the Lamuiae, and the two inferior downwards to ai-ticulatc with the corresponding Vertebra, ahove and below. 19 On either side between the body and commencement of the Arch; they are so adapted to each other that the imion of two Vertebrae on either side, forms a rounded opening called the Inter-vertebral Foramen, which gives exit to the Spinal Nerves and some Vessels. 20 By their bodies and articular sxu-faces. 21 Nine: so united as to constitute two Bones, viz. Sacrum and Coccyx. 22 Five. 23 Four. CEEVICAL VEETEBEiE. 24 The Body is smaller than a Dorsal Vertebrae with the greatest diameter placed tranversely, the anterior sur- face is more flattened. 95 In the Transverse process on either side is a Foramen (Vertebral), which transmits the Vertebral Artery, &c.; on the upper surface on either side is a Groove for the passage of the Spinal Nerves, this Groove Bifurcates near the summit, forming two Tubercles, (anterior and posterior), for the attachment of Muscles. S6 The Spinous processes are horizontal and short, especially the third, fourth, and fifth, all are Bifurcated except the last, and give attachment to Muscles. 27 The processes are obliquely inclined; the two superior are directed upwards and backwards, and the two inferior forwards and downwards. 28 The Atlas. 29 It has neither Body nor anatomically speaking Spinous process, being more like a Eing. 30 It is much larger. 31 To articulate with the Odontoid process of the second Cervical Vertebra or Axis. 32 One of the four slips of the Longus Colli Muscle, (its insertion). 33 Unlike the other Vertebrae they are situated behind the Articular Processes. 34 Oval, and concave, and directed inwards, so as to form two small cavities for the Condyles of the Os Occipitis. 35 Circular and almost horizontal.

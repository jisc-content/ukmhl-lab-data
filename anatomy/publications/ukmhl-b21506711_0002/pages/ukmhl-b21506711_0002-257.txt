OBT HUMAK ANATOMY. 255 3 It divides beneath the Platysma Myoides into a Descending and an Ascending Branch, which are distributed to the Platysma and to the Integument on the side and front of the Neck, towards the Chin, also the lower part of the Eace. 24 By Branches from the second and third Nerves of the Cervical Plexus. 25 It divides into Auricular, Mastoid, and Facial Branches. 26 Prom the second Cervical Nerve of the Plexus. 27 Acromial and Clavicular. 28 Prom the third and fourth Nerves of the Cervical Plexus. 29 To the Integuments on the upper and anterior part of the Chest from the Sternum to the Shoulder. 30 These are the Phrenic, Muscular, and Communicating Branches. 31 By the third and fourth Branches of the Cervical Plexus, and sometimes joined by a Branch from the fifth Cervical Nerve. 32 To the Diaphragm (its under surface). 33 No; the left is the longest, owing to the position of the Heart. 34 Two; one derived from the second, and the other from the third. Nerve of the Plexus. 35 These Branches, derived from the Loop between the two first Nerves of the Plexus are distributed to the Trapezius, Levator Anguli ScapulaB, Ehomboidei, and Rectus Anticus Major Muscles. 36 The Sympathetic and contiguous Abdominal Plexuses. POSTEEIOE CEEVICAL PLEXUS. 3 7 By the frequent communications of the posterior Primary Branches of the first or Sub-occipital Nerve with the second and third Cervical Nerves. 38 Between the Complexus and Semispinalis Colli Muscles. 39 Muscular, Cutaneous, and the greater Occipital Nerve. 40 To the Sterno-mastoid, Levator Anguli Scapulae, Tra- pezius, and middle Scalenus Muscles. 41 To the Neck and Scalp (on their posterior Aspect). 42 The largest Cutaneous Nerve at the back of the Head, ' to which it is distributed by numerous Offsets, and forms the continuation of the second Cervical Nerve. 43 To the Muscles and Integument in the posterior part of the Neck (Cervical) and upper Dorsal Eegion.

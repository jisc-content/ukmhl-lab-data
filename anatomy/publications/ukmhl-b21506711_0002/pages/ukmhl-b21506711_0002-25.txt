OK irUMAN ANATOMY. 23 109 Two or three Orifices for the transmission of some Palatine Branches to the soft Palate. 110 Six: two Cranial (Sphenoid and Ethmoid), superior Maxillaiy, inferior spongy Bone, the Vomer and its fellow of the opposite side. 111 Four: Azygos Uvuloe, internal and external Ptery- goid, and the Circumflcxus Palati. 112 Prom only a siagie Ossiflc point. INFEItlOK SPONGY BONES. 113 In the jSTasal Possa. 114 Into two surfaces (internal and external), and two bor- ders (superior and inferior). 115 The internal surface is convex and projects towards the Septum of the Nose. 116 The external siu'face is concave and bounds the inferior Meatus. 117 Pour articulations: the superior articulates with the ascending process of the superior Maxillary Bone, the Palate Bone, the Lachi-ymal Bone and the Ethmoid Bone, the inferior or lower border is free, 118 None. 119 Prom only one Ossific point. VOMEE. 120 The Vomer is the thin perpendicular Plate of Bone in the middle of the ISTares, and forms the posterior-in- ferior pai't of the Septum. 121 The perpendicular Plate of the Ethmoid. 122 Into two lateral surfaces and four borders. 123 Part of the inner "Wall of each Nasal Possa. 124 The Eostrum of the Sphenoid Bone. 125 It is received into the fissure or groove formed by the Palatal Processes of the superior Maxillary and Palate Bones. 126 This sharp border is free and unattached, and in the recent state forms a Septum which divides the Nares posteriorly. 127 I'his rough border presents a fissure forming two por- tions or Layers, one of which receives the sharp Edge of the perpendicular Plate of the Ethmoid Bone, and the other the Median Septxim or Nasal Cartilage. 128 Grooves for the passage of the Vessels and Nerves, and one especially for the Naso-palatine Nerve or Nerve of Cotunnius, which is derived from Meckel's Ganglion.

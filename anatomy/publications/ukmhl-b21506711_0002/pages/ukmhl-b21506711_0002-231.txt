229 OK HUMAN ANATOMY. 28 Vasa Inferentia. 29 Vasa Efferentia. 30 The Yasa Inferentia. 31 They appear to be composed of convoluted Lymphatic Eamuscidi forming, with the Blood-vessels ramifying in the midst of these convolutions, a Plexus, which is enclosed in a Cellular Structure. 32 They are composed of two Coats: an external, analogous to that of the Blood-vessels; and an internal or Serous Coat, which is continuous with that of the Veins. 33 Valves. 34 Like the Veins, into four sets or groups, viz: those of the Head and jSTeck, those of the Trunk, those of the Upper Extremity, and those of the Lower Extremity. Section XLV.—LYMPHATICS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 1 Into two sets: a superficial and a deep. 2 The Occipital, Temporal, and Eaeial. 3 The Meningeal and Cerebral; those of the Face pass from the Nasal Fossse, Mouth, and Pharynx. 4 Occipital, posterior Auricular, Parotid, Submaxillary. 5 In the Thoracic and right Lymphatic Ducts. 6 Some accompany the external Jugular Vein, others are situated along the base of the inferior Maxilla on either side. 7 They accompany the internal Jugular Vein, Carotid Aitery, Pharynx, CEsophagus, and Trachea. Section XLVI.—LYMPHATICS OF THE THORAX, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS; OR TRUNK. 1 Yes. 2 Into two sets—superficial and deep, which are distri- buted throughout the surface and texture of these Organs. 3 They accompany the Coronary Vessels. 4 In the Thoracic and right Lymphatic Ducts. 5 The Sternal, Intercostal, Oesophageal, Cardiac, Bronchial. 6 Yes. 7 In the Renal Lymphatics. 8 Into the Inguinal Glands. 9 Through the special Aperture in the Fascia Lata of the Thigh, the Saphenous opening, (Foramen Saphenum) 10 Into the Mesenteric Glands.

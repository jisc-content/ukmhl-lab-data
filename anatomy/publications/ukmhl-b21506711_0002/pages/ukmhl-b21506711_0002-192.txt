ANSWEES TO QUESTIONS 190 ultimately terminates in two Branches; the Frontal and Nasal. 49 These Branches are arranged, according to some Anato- mists, into three sets or groups, according to others, into two sets : they arc the Lachrjonal, Supra-orbital, the Centi-al Artery of the Eetina, the two Ciliary, the two Ethmoidal, the two Palpebral, the ifasal, the Frontal, and the Muscular Branches. 50 From the Ophthalmic, just before it enters the Optic Foramen, and is distiibuted to the Lachrymal Gland. 51 The deep Temporal Arteries, also the middle Meningeal. 52 The Supra-orbital Foramen, and supplies the Muscles and Integument of the Forehead. 53 By piercing obliquely the substance of the Optic Nerve. 54 Into three sets: the short or posterior, the long, and the anterior Ciliary Arteries. 55 To the Choroid and Ciliary Processes. 56 They vary from ten to fifteen. 57 To the Iiis, where they form a Vascular Zone. 58 Two. 59 From the Muscular Branches of the Ophthalmic Artery. 60 They Anastomose with the preceding around the cir- cumference of the Iris. 61 Two : an anterior and a posterior. 62 The anterior. 63 They pass through the Ethmoidal Foramina in the inner "Wall of the Orbit, and are distributed to the Ethmoidal Cells and Nasal Fossae, where they freely Anastomose with the Nasal Branches of the internal Maxillary. 64 Yes; they suj)ply small Meningeal Branches to the Dura Mater (the anterior Meningeal). 65 The anterior Ethmoidal Artery. 66 Two : one for each Eyelid, a superior and inferior. 67 The Orbitar Branch of the Temporal Ai-tery, also the Lachi'ymal. 68 The Lachrymal Artery. 69 To the Muscles of the Orbit. 70 From the Palpebral Branches. 71 It divides into two Branches; one communicates with the angular or Terminal Branch of the Facial Artery, and the other division runs along the side of the Nose, to which it is distributed. 72 To the Muscles, Integuments, and Pericranium..

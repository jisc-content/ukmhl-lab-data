ON H1XMAN ANATOMY. 21 , â€ž NASAL BONES. 65 Two. 66 Below the Frontal Bone and between the Ascending or Nasal Processes of the superior MaxiUary Bones. 67 Into two surfaces (anterior and posterior), and foxu- borders. 6 8 Convex laterally and concave longitudinally, and presents two or three Vascular Foramina. 69 Concave, and marked by a groove for the passage of the Nasal Branch of the Ophthalmic. 70 Four articulations: superior, inferior, external, and internal. 71 Superiorly with the Frontal Bone, the perpendicular Plate of the Ethmoid, externally with the ascending or Nasal Process of the superior Maxillary Bone, and internally by the Nasal Sutiu'e with its fellow of the opposite side, and in the recent subject it is connected inferiorly with the Nasal Cartilages. 72 Superiorly by the Nasal Ethmoid and Sphenoid Bones, inferiorly by the Palatal Processes of the superior Maxillary and Palate Bones externally by the superior Maxillary, Palate, Lachrymal, inferior spongy, Eth- moid and internal Pterygoid Plate of the Sphenoid Bone, and internally by the same Bones as the external boundary. 73 The Vomer and perpendicular Plate of theEthmoidBone. 74 None: the Pyramidalis Nasi and Compressor Naris are merely in relation with it. 75 From only one Ossiflc point. 76 Two PALATE BONES. 77 At the posterior part of the Nares between the Pterygoid Processes of the Sphenoid and the superior Maxillary Bones. 78 Like the letter L, and divided into a horizontal Plate, a perpendicidar Plate, and a Tuberosity. 79 The horizontal Plate which assists to form its inferior surface. 80 A transverse Ridge to which is attached the Aponeurosis of the Circumflexus Palati. 81 The posterior Palatine Canal which transmits the pos- terior Palatine Nerve and Artery. 82 This Edge which is slightly Serrated, articulates with the Palatal Process of the superior Maxillary Bone. 83 This concave Edge gives attachment to the soft Palate.

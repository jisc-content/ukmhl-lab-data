ANSWEES TO QTTESTIOITS 240 Section LII.â€”COVERINGS OF THE BRAIK 1 Dura Mater, Pia Mater, and Aradmoid Membrane. 2 The Dura Mater. DTJEA MATEE. 3 The strong fibrous Membrane which lines the inside of the Skull and Spinal Column, and separates and supports various portions of the Brain by means of Duplicatures or Processes. 4 It consists of two Lamina3: an external white Fibrous Layer, and an internal Special or Serous Layer. 5 Eough, and corresponds with the inner surface of the Cranium, to which it is very adherent. 6 Smooth, polished, and lubricated. 7 Small whitish granular bodies. 8 Along the middle line on the internal surface of the Dura Mater. 9 Yes. 10 The Venous Channels of the Brain, which have been already described in the Section on the Veins. 11 Falx Cerebri, Tentorium Cerebelli, and Falx CerebeUi. 12 This Process forms a partition along the upper and middle line, extending from the edge or Process of the Crista GaUi of the Ethmoid Bone ia front to the Tentorium Cerebelli behind, to both of which it is attached. 13 That of a sickle, with the broadest part or basis turned backwards. 14 It passes between the Hemispheres, and supports either in the various positions of the Head. 15 The superior and inferior Longitudinal and Straight Sinuses. TENTOEIirat CEEEBELLI. 16 That portion of the Dura Mater which is stretched across the posterior part of the Cavity of the Cranimn, between the posterior under surface of the Cerebrum and upper surface of the Cerebellum. 17 On either side to the angles of the Petrous Bone; behind, to the transverse ridge of the Os Occipitis; and in front, to the Clinoid Processes of the Sphenoid Bone. 18 The Straight Sinus. 19 The lateral and superior Petrosal Sinuses. 20 Its middle, which joins the Falx Cerebri. 21 The Cerebrum from the Cerebellum, and supports the posterior Lobes of the former.

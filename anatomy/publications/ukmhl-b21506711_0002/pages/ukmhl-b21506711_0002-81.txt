CARTILAGES OP THE LAETNX. 41 Thyroid, Cricoid, and the two Aiytsenoid Cartilages. 42 Pomum Adami. 43 Epiglottis, on either side of which is the Cuneiform Cartilage. 44 This (somewhat triangular) Pibro-cartilage, is situated in front of the opening of the Larynx, which it closes during the act of Deglutition, assuming a horizontal position; and dming respiration it assumes a vertical position. 45 The opening into the Laryngeal Cavity. 46 These according to some Anatomists are divided into two groups, those which connect it to the Hyoid Bone and the Trachea, and those by which the several pieces are connected to each other. 47 The Crico-thp-oideus, Crico-aryta^noideus Posticus, Crico arytaenoideus Lateralis, Thyro-aryttenoideus, and the single one in the middle, the Aiytsenoideus.

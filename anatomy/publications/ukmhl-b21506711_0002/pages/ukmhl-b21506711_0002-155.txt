153 ON HTUMAN ANATOMY. 11 The Optic, the Sphenoidal and Spheno-maxillary Fis- sures, the Infi.-a and Supra Orbital Foramina, the Temporo-malar Foramina, the anterior and posterior Ethmoidal Foramina, and the Opening of the Nasal Duct. 12 The Eyeballs, Lachrymal Glands, Muscles, Nerves, Blood-yessels, and Adipose Tissue. ETEBAILS. 13 Almost Spherical. 14 Into two parts, an anterior and a posterior, the latter fonning foiu'-fifths of the Globe, and the anterior the remaining fifth. 15 The transparent portion (Cornea). 16 The opaque portion. 17 Three: they are, commencing externally, the Sclerotic with the Cornea; the second or Vascular Coat is the Choroid, with the Iris, Ciliary Ligament, and Muscle; the most internal is the Eetina, with the Zonula Ciliaris. ITJNICA SCLEEOTICA. 18 The Sclerotic with the Cornea complete the external Timic of the Eyeball, and gives to it, from its density, its peculiar form. 19 The Optic Nerve. 20 Its posterior part, a little to its inner side. 21 From the entrance of the Optic Nerve, with whose Sheath it is continuous, to the Margin of the Cornea. 22 The Apertures for the transmission of the Nutrient Yessels. 23 Transversely, about half-an-inch. 24 Convex and smooth, except where the Muscles are attached to it. 25 Concave, and of a dark colour, and iu apposition with the middle Tunic of the Eyeball (the Choroid). 26 The posterior part; and becomes thinner and whiter as it approaches the Cornea, hence the common expression applied to itâ€”the White of the Eye. 27 It consists of an interlacement of Fibrous and yellow elastic Tissues. 28 Their presence in it is doubtful. 29 A thin Cribriform Lamella or Plate, which is perforated by minute openings for the passage of the Nervous Filaments. 30 No; there is one larger than the rest called Porus Opticus.

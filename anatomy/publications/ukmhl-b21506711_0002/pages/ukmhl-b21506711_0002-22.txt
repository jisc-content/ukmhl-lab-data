20 ANSWEES TO QrrESTIOXS 44 Two. MAXAE BONES. 45 This Bone, which forms the prominence of the Cheek, is divided into three sm-faces; anterior, posterior, and superior. 46 Smooth and convex, and gives origin to the Zygomaticus Major et Minor Muscles. 47 Several small Foramina, (one larger than the rest), which transmit Branches of the Temporo-Malar Nerve and minute Ai-teries. 48 Concave, and forms the anterior boundary of the Zygo- matic Fossa. 49 Part of the outer border or margin of the Orbit, and a small portion of its Orbital Floor. 50 Three. 51 The origin of the Masseter, (from the anterior two- thirds of the Arch). 52 Four; three Cranial, (Frontal, Temporal, and Sphen- oid), and the superior Maxillary Bone. 53 The Levator Labii Superioris, Zygomatici, (Major et Minor), Orbicularis Palpebrarum, Temporal and Masseter. 54 From only a single Ossific point. 55 Two LACHETMAL BONES. 56 At the anterior and inner WaU or angle of the Orbit. 57 Into two surfaces (external and internal), and four borders. 58 This surface which is smooth, is divided into two parts by a vertical ridge, the inner part assists to form a portion of the Wall of the Orbit, and the other or anterior part lodges the Lachi'ymal Sac. 59 The origin of the Tensor Tai'si. 60 This rough surface assists to form part of the middle Meatus anteriorly, and completes the anterior Eth- moidal Cells posteriorly. 61 Four Articulations: superior, inferior, anterior, and posterior. 62 Superiorly by Suture with the Orbital Process of the Frontal Bone, anteriorly with the superior Maxillary Bone, inferiorly with the inferior Tm-binated Bone, and posteriorly "with the Os Planum of the Ethmoid Bone. 63 Only one: the Tensor Tarsi. 64 From only one Ossific point.

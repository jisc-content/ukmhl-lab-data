ANSWEES TO QUESTIOXS 260 distributed to the Wrist Joiat, viz: to the-Ligaments and Articulations of the Carpus. 49 Yes; with three exceptions in the Superficial Layer— the Anconeus, Supinator Radii Longus, and the long Extensor of the Wrist, viz : Extensor Carpi Radialis Longior. Sectiok LVII.—DOESAL NERVES. 1 Twelve pairs. 2 The Intervertebral Foramina. 3 The first between the first and second Dorsal Vertebrae, and the last between the last Dorsal and first Lumbar. 4 Yes; one is called a Dorsal, and the other an Intercostal, Nerve. 5 Directly backwards, between the Transverse Processes and divide each into aMuscular and Musculo-cutaneous which are distributed to the Dorsal Muscles and Integuments. 6 The anterior Primary Branches of the Dorsal Nerves. Y Twelve. 8 Horizontally forwards in the Intercostal spaces (except the last which is below the last Rib), and accompany the Intercostal Vessels, each lying below the Vein and Artery. 9 Some Sympathetic Eilaments from the adjoining Ganglia. 10 Its distribution is the same, but difi'ers from them from the circumstance of its not being situated in an Inter- costal Space, being below the last Rib. 11 A Muscular and a Cutaneous Branch. 12 Into two : a Lateral and an anterior Cutaneous Branch; the former divides into anterior and posterior Fila- ments for the supply of the Integuments of the antero-lateral and lateral parts of the Trunk. 13 About midway between the Vertebral Column and the Sternum. 14 Each Intercostal Nerve is continued onwards to the side of the Sternum, where it terminates as the anterior Cutaneous Nerve of the Thorax. No such Plexus exists. 15 No. 16 Each gives off an Intercosto-humeral Branch. 17 It perforates the outer Intercostal Muscle of the second Intercostal Space, and divides into two Branches— an external and internal; the former communicates

51 OIT HtraiAN ANATOMY. Sectioit IX.â€”BOJS'ES of THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 1 Into the Thigh, Leg, and Foot. 2 The Os Femoris. ^^^^^^ 3 Into a Body and two extremities (superior and inferior). 4 Nearly cylindrical, being somewhat arched with its convexity dii'ected forwards. 5 Linea Aspera, which bifurcates above and below. 6 The upper Lips or Borders terminate: the inner one at the Root of the lesser Trochanter, and the outer one at the Root of the greater Trochanter. 7 At the Tuberosities of the Condyles, forming the internal and external Condyloid Ridges. 8 The Popliteal surface of the Femm' corresponding with the Popliteal Vessels. , 9 The Head, Xeck, and two Eminences called Trochanters. 10 Upwards and inwards, and presents a little behind and below its centre an oval depression for the attach- ment of the round Ligament. 11 TJpwai-ds and imvards from the shaft, and compressed jfrom before backwards. 12 Three; anterior, siiperior, and inferior. 13 The inferior surface. 14 Upwards, and somewhat concave. 15 Smooth and broad. 16 The larger outstanding process external to the Neck. 17 The insertion of the Gluteus Minimus and to its outer surface Gluteus Medius. 18 Part of the origin of the Vastus Extemus. 19 The Tendons of the Obturator Internus, Gemellus Superior et Inferior, and the Pyiiformis. 20 The Tendon of the Obturator Extemus. 21 The smaller outstanding process at the inner and back part of the shaft, immediately below the base of the Iseck. 22 The Tendons of insertion of the Psoas Magnus and . IHacus. 23 The Inter-trochanteric Ridges. 24 The inferior boundary of the Neck of the Femur. 25 The two Condyles. 26 The inner Condyle. 27 A deep Notch, the Inter-Condyloid Notch, in which are inserted the Crucial Ligaments.

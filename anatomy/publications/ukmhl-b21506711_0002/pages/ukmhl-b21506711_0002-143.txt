141 Oir mJMAN" ANATOlir. 166 About one inch and a half in length; from side to side nearly an inch; and weighs from six to eight drachms. 167 Its substance consists of a gi'eat number of minute conical Tubes, whose bases are directed towards the surface, and the apices towards the Mediastinura; around which the Blood-vessels are aiTanged in Plexuses. 168 Each is invested by two Layers, one derived from the Tunica Vasculosa, and the other from the Tunica Albuginea. 169 Two: the Tunica Vaginalis, and the Tunica Albugip-ea. 170 A distinct Sac derived from the Peritoneum, which invests the Testis as the Pericardium does the Heart, &c., and therefore a shut Sac. 171 Into the Tuuica Vaginalis Propria and the Tunica Vaginalis Eeflexa. 172 Yes; except posteriorly, where the Vessels enter or leave it. 173 The reflected or Parietal portion, which Hnes the con- tiguous Layer of the Scrotum. 174 Between its two Layers the surface is smooth, and secretes a Pluid. 175 The Tunica Propria vel Dura Mater of the Testis. 176 It is of a bluish-white colom', analogous to the Sclerotic Coat of the Eye, dense and fibrous; its fibres present a net-work appearance, interlacing in all directions; from its unyielding nature it maintains the shape of the Testis. 177 Yes ; and one of them, larger than the rest, is called Mediastinum Testis vel Corpus Highmorianum. 178 It serves to lodge the Seminal Ducts and Blood-vessels in their passage into the substance of the Testis. 179 In a transverse section of the organ it will be observed that the Ducts are situated near to the fr'ee margin of the Mediastinum, whilst the Blood-vessels are situated near its posterior border. 180 This Layer (thePia Mater Testis) is situated immedi- ately within the Tunica Albuginea, and is the thin Vascular or Nutrient Layer of the Testis. 181 Yes; and lines the Eibrous Processes of the Tunica Albuginea. 182 By the ultimate ramifications of the Spermatic Blood- vessels, which are united by CcUular Tissue.

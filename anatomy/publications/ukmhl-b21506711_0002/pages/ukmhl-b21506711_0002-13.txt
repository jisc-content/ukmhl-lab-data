ox HUMAN AXATOMY. 11 84 Above by the Orbital Plates of the Prontal Bone, and portion of the lesser "Wings of the Sphenoid; below by the Orbital Processes of the superior Maxillary and Palate Bones, externally by the Orbital Pro- cesses of the Malar and greater Wings of the Sphe- noid Bones and internally by the Lachrymal, Ossa Plana of the Ethmoid, and a portion of the body of the Sphenoid Bones. 85 Twelve : two Paiietal, two Malar, two jSTasal, two Ossa Unguis vel Lachrymal, the Sphenoid, Ethmoid, and the two superior Maxillary Bones. 86 Foiu' pairs: the Occipito-frontalis, Corrugator Super- cilli, a part of the Temporal and pai't of the Obicula- ris Palpabra3 vel Oculi on either side. 87 The inner part of the Superciliary ridge. 88 Two : corresponding to the Erontal Eminences. 89 Two TEMPOEAL BONES. 90 The Temporal Bone occupies the side and base of the SkuU. 91 Into three parts: a Squamous, Mastoid, and Petrous portion. 92 This portion forms part of the "Wall of the Temple. 93 Smooth and gives origin to the Temporal Muscle. 94 The Zygoma. 95 An Arch: the Zygomatic Arch. 96 Convex; the inner, concave. 97 Concave. 98 The Glenoid Cavity. 99 Two roots, an anterior and a posterior. 100 The Glenoid Cavity. 101 The anterior; its course is horizontally inwards, and foi-ms the front boundary of the Cavity, and from the circumstance of its forming a rounded eminence is called Eminentia Articularis. 102 This root, called also the Supra-mastoid ridge, forms the upper boundary of the cavity. 1,03 It terminates somewhat abruptly at a narrow fissure which separates the Squamous from the Mastoid por- tions of the Bone; this fissure is caUed Fissura Glasseri. 104 The Tendon of the Laxator Tympani Muscle. 105 The Temporal Fascia or Aponeui-osis. 106 The Massctcr Muscle.

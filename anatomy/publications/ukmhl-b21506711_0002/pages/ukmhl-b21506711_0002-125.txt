123 OIT HUMAN ANATOMY. 111 Two limated Folds, forming the elliptic Aperture whicli leads from the Ilium into the C tecum and Colon at their junction. 113 Each Fold is formed hy the circular Muscular Fibres of the Gut with the Mucous Membrane. 113 The lower; by its convex margin at the junction of the Ilium and Cseeum. 114 The transverse Meso-colon. 115 Small processes of Peritoneum which contain fat, and situated in the large Intestine, especially the transverse Colon. 116 Crescentie. 117 From the superior and inferior Mesenteric Arteries. 118 From the superior and inferior Mesenteric and Hypo- gastric Plexuses. JlECTtTM. 119 About eight inches long, & extends from the left Sacro- iliac Symphysis in fr-ont of the Sacrum to the Anus. 120 Into three parts, an upper, a middle, and a lower part. 121 From the Sacro-iHac Sjonphysis to about the middle of the Sacrum. 122 By a Fold of Peritoneum—the Meso-rectum. 123 The Pyriformis, and Sacral Plexus of Nerves. 124 Branches of the internal Iliac Artery and the Ureter. 125 About four inches long. 126 About three inches long, and extends from about the middle of the Sacrum to the tip of the Coccyx. 127 By its lower part with the base or triangular part of the Bladder, with the Vesicula3 Seminales, Vasa Deferentia, the Prostate Gland, and, in the female, with the Vagina. 128 IN'early one-and-a-half inch long, and extends from opposite the Prostate Gland to the Anus. 129 The Bulb and Membranous part of the Urethra, also, the Prostate Gland. 130 The Band of the internal Sphincter Muscle. 131 The Sphincter Muscles. 132 Like the small Intestine it consists of four Coats—a Serous, Muscular, Fibrous, and Mucous. 133 The front and sides of the ascending and descending Colon, and fi'ont of the Caecum; whilst the posterior and inner border corresponds with the space between the Lamella; of the Meso-colon.

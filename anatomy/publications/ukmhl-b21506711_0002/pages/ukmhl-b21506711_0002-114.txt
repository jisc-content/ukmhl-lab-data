112 ANSWEES TO atJESTIOirS tho Blood, having undergone the necessary changes, is returned as Arterial Blood by the four PuLmonarj- Yeias into the left Auricle, which being distended, now contracts and propels its contents into the left Ventricle, and from the left Ventricle it is propelled through the Aorta into the Capillaries, where it is distributed to eveiy pait of the body, and again returned to the Heart by the Veins into the right Auricle where it undergoes the same process again. 93 The Tricuspid Valve. 94 The Mitral Valve. 95 Each by the Semi-lunar Valves. TBACHEA. 96 The Air Tube extends from the Laryirs to the Lungs, it commences opposite the fifth Cervical Vertebra and ends opposite the thii'd, and sometimes as low as the fifth. Dorsal Vertebra, where it divides into the two Bronchiâ€”one for each Limg. 97 About four-and-a-half inches long, and tubular, but flattened posteriorly, o^\ing to the non-existence of Cartilaginous Bands. 98 Anteriorly of a series of Fibro-cartilaginous Segments or Eings (from sixteen to twentj' in number), which extend for about two-thirds aroxmd the tube, and united by a yellow elastic Fibrous Tissue; the pos- terior part of the Tube is completed by Tibrous Membrane, Muscular Fibres, and Tracheal Glands. 99 By a Mucous Membrane with the subjacent yellow elastic Fibrous Tissue. 100 The divisions of the Trachea.

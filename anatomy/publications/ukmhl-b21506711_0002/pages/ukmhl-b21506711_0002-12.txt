10 AlfSWEES TO QTJESTIOKS 61 A small hole improperly called Foramen Ctecum, as it gives passage to a small Vein from the IS'asal Fossjb into the Longitudinal Sinus. 62 A Fold of the Dura Mater, the Falx Cerebri, which here divides the Hemispheres of the Brain. 63 The GlandulfB Pacchioni. 64 A wide exca^-ation called the Ethmoidal Xotch, which lodges within it the Cribriform Plate of the Ethmoid Bone. 65 These Plates, which extend horizontally backwards, are smooth and concave at their under sm-face forming the roof of the Orbit, whilst the upper or Cerebral surfaces are convex, and marked by elevations and depressions called Digital Fossas, which correspond with the Sulci and Convolutions of the anterior Lobes of the Brain. 66 By the external and internal Angular Processes. 67 To the Malar Bone. 68 To the Nasal Process of the superior Maxillary Bone, and the Nasal Bone; 69 Thick and serrated. 70 Thin, and iiTegular, and articulates with the Sphenoid Bone. 71 The Orbital Plates are the thinnest and the Nasal and external Angular Processes, the thickest. 72 That space or interval which exists in Adult age be- tween the tAvo Tables of the Frontal Bone and divided by a ridge of Bone into two Cellular Cavities. 73 The Lachrj-mal Gland. 74 The Cartilaginous Pulley of the superior Oblique Muscle. 75 Nine: the Optic, Spheno-maxillary, and Sphenoidal Fissiu-es, Supra and Infra-orbital Canals, anterior and posterior Ethmoidal Foramina, Temporo-Malar Foramina, and Nasal Duct. 76 Optic Nerve and Ophthalmic Artery. 77 Spheno-maxillary Nerve and Artery. 78 The thiixl, fourth, and sixth Nerves; the first Branch or Ophthalmic division of the fifth, and the Ophthal- mic Vein. 79 The Supra-orbital or Frontal Nerve and Ai-tery. 80 The Infra-orbital Nerve and Artery. 81 The Nasal Nerve and anterior Ethmoidal Artery. 82 The posterior Ethmoidal Artery and A'ein. 83 Filaments of the Orbital Branch of the superior Max- illary Nerve.

The Hiatus FaUopii which leads to the aqueduct of Fallopius. 124 The smaU superficial Petrosal Branch of the Tympanic Nerve or Nerve of Jacobson. 125 The large superficial Petrosal IS'erve. 126 The Gasserian Ganglion. 127 The Tensor Tympani Muscle. 128 The Eustachian Tube. 129 A thin partition or Lamella of Bone called Processus Cochleariformis. 130 Part of the posterior Fossa of the base of the Skull. 131 The large apertiu-e which leads to a short Canal, viz.: the Meatus Auditorius Internus, which passes liorizontally outwards.

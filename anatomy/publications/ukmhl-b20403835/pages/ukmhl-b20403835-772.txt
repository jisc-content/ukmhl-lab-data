370 HEAD AND NECK. end) is projected, externally and inferiorly, from the posterior surface, and at the external border, of the scalenus anticus muscle. 53. Thyroid Axis and its Brandies, Plates 192 to 198, in- clusive.—The thyroid axis (Plates 197 and 198), branch of the first portion of the subclavian, trifurcates into the inferior thyroid, superficial cervical, and suprascapular branches. The inferior thyroid (Plates 196, 197, and 198) extends, superiorly, along the anterior surface of the internal third of the scalenus anticus muscle, as far as the rectus capitis anticus major mus- cle ; it then curves internally and is continued to the lateral lobe of the thyroid body. It is located in a plane posteriorly to the internal jugular vein, pneumogastric nerve, common carotid artery, and sympathetic nerve. Its vertical portion gives ofT the ascending cervical artery, which runs superiorly, anteriorly to the scalenus anticus muscle. The superficial cervical (Plates 192 to 198, inclusive) has a transverse course to the point where it passes, by several branches, to the an- terior surface of the inferior portion of the trapezius muscle. The suprascapular (Plate 192 ; Plates 194 to 198, inclusive) makes an abrupt curve, inferiorly and externally, to the pos- terior of the clavicle. 54. Posterior Scapular Artery, Plates 192, 194, and 197.— This artery (vena3 comites), branch of the third portion of the subclavian, is projected, posteriorly, internally to the scalenus merlins, scalenus posticus, and levator anguli scapulas muscles, to reach its posterior distribution (page 269 ; Plate 149). 55. Subclavian Vein, Plates 192, 194, 196, 197, and 198.— This vessel lies posteriorly, and a little inferiorly, to the clav- icle ; it runs parallel with the second and third portions of the subclavian artery, and is separated from the second portion of the artery by the scalenus anticus muscle. 56. Brachial Plexus, Plates 192 to 198, inclusive.—The su- perior trunks of this plexus—the anterior divisions of the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical spinal nerves—are projected, exter- nally and inferiorly ; they emerge from between (sometimes perforate) the scalenus anticus and scalenus medius muscles;

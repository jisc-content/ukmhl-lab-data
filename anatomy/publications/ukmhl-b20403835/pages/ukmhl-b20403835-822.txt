HEAD AND NECK. 400 border of the interior portion of the thyro-arytenoid muscle that it is not clearly defined. 26. Inferior Thyro-arytenoid Ligament.—This well-defined ligament, the essential element of a true vocal cord, extends, postero-anteriorly, from the anterior angle of the base of an arytenoid cartilage to the posterior surface of the thyroid car- tilage (to one side of the middle of its angle), and inferiorly to the last-described ligament. 27. Ventricle and Laryngeal Poucli of the Larynx.—A ventricle was before described (page 398) and illustrated (Fig. 1, Plate 208): a laryngeal pouch may now be demonstrated as having the interior portion of the thyro-arytenoid muscle in its internal wall, and the exterior portion of the same muscle in its external wall. 28. Epiglottis or Epiglottic Cartilage.—In structure this is dense fibrous tissue with some cartilage tissue. It is pitcher- cover shaped, and is hinged—by its attachment—to the poste- rior surface of the thyroid cartilage—in, and to the sides of, the angle—at a point superiorly to the attachments of the superior thyro-arytenoid ligaments. Its surfaces are invested by mucous membrane (Fig. 2,' Plate 206 ; Fig. 1, Plate 208), which form its fraenum and frenula, anteriorly (page 393 ; Fig. 2, Plate 206), and its aryteno-epiglottidean folds, posteriorly (Fig. 2, Plate 206 ; Fig. 1, Plate 208). Two pairs of muscles act upon it; the aryteno-epiglottidean and thyro-epiglottidean (page 397 ; Fig. 2, Plates 207 and 208). NASAL CAVITIES AND CONTIGUOUS PAKTS. Terms of Relation.—The general terms (page 2) ; and the special terms interior and exterior—relatively to the nasal cavities—will serve to locate parts described. Nasal Cavities : their Boundary Walls; Osseous Openings ; and Lining.—Fourteen bones, five cartilages, and fibrous tis- sue uniting the cartilages, form the walls of the two nasal cav- ities. These cavities have the following walls : an inferior, a

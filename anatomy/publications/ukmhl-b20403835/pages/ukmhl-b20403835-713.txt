TWENTY-FOURTH DISSECTION. SUPERFICIAL REGION OF THE FACE; ORBITAL CAV- ITY ; MIDDLE FOSSA OF THE CRANIUM; DEEP REGION OF THE FACE. STJPEBFICIAL EEGION OF THE FACE. Dissection.—Prepare the face for dissection as follows: remove all hair from the skin ; distend the nostrils with oakum; introduce oakum under the eyelids and suture their edges together ; close the teeth, insert oakum between them and the cheeks and lips, then suture the lips together. With the subject in position for dissection of the thorax and upper extremities (page 193), place the lateral surface of the head upon a block, and steady it in the position shown in Fig. 2, Plate 182. Terms of Relation.—These are the general terms (page 2) ; and the special terms centero-lateral—applied to the face—ex- terior and interior—relatively to the mouth and nostrils. Bones, and Bone Attachments of lluselcs, Plate 181.—The osseous framework of the anterolateral area of the face includes the following bones : for the cranial region, the frontal; for the upper jaw region, the nasal, superior maxillary, and malar ; for the lower jaw region, the inferior maxillary. The facial surfaces of all of these bones, except the nasal, afford attachments to muscles. Dissection.—Make the skin incisions 2, 3, 3, 3, and 4, 4, of Figure 14, (page 318) ; reflect a flap as indicated. Where the dissection of the scalp has preceded that of the face, skin incision 2 will have been made. Expose a layer of subcutaneous tissue. 1. Subcutaneous Tissue.—A layer of subcutaneous tissue containing a variable quantity of fat, spreads over the antero- lateral area of the face.

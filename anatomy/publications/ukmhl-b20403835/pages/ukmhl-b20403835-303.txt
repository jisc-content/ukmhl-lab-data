ELEVENTH DISSECTION. PLANTAR REGION OF THE FOOT. Dissection.—Eaise the foot and lodge the heel on a block, so as to bring the sole on a convenient level for the dissector standing in front of it. Steady the foot by chain-hooks or strings. Terms of Relation.—The special terms 'proximal (toward the heel), distal (from the heel), outer side, inner side, plan- tar surface, and dorsal surface will apply to the entire area of the dissection ; pollex border and minim border to the tarsal and metatarsal regions; plantar and lateral digital surfaces to the digits. Bone Areas, Plate 75.—The plantar surface of the following bones forms the osseous plane of the sole of the foot: the calcaneum ; the as- tragalus ; the cuboid; the scaphoid ; the three cuneiform—internal, middle, and external; the five metatarsal; the fourteen tones of the digits —five phalanges, four phalangines, and five phalangettes (see page 123). With the excep- tion of the astragalus and the middle cuneiform, they all afford attachments to muscles. Dissection.—Make the skin incisions 1, 2, and 3 of Figure 6. Figure 6, and reflect flaps as indicated. Where the dorsum of the foot has been previously dissected the flaps will have to be cut away; otherwise they can be tied over the dorsum of the foot by strings. 1. Subcutaneous Tissue.—This plane of tissue is thick and dense over the heel and outer half of the dissection area, with

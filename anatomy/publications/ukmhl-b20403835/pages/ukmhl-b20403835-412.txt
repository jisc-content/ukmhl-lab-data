LOWER EXTREMITY. 190 9. Transverse Ligament, Fig. 1, Plate 110.—This ligament passes between the anterior borders of the fibro-cartilages. 10. Coronary Ligament.—This is a circumferential liga- ment, that bridges from the convexities of the nbro-cartilage plates to the border of the tibia; anteriorly and posteriorly, fibres of the crucial ligaments are continued to it. AETICULATXON OF THE HIP. Dissection.—Raise the pelvis on a block with its posterior surface upper- most. Cut away all the muscles attached to the surfaces of the os innominatum and the proximal end of the femur. Terms of Relation.—The general terlns of relation (page 2) will be used in the description of the hip-joint. Bones of the Articulation, Plates 59 and 91.—The femur- head and neck—and the os innominatum—cotyloid cavity (acetabulum)—are the bones forming the ilio-femoral articula- tion or hip-joint. Dissection.—Clear the posterior surface of the capsular ligament of the joint. 1. Posterior Portion of the Capsular Ligament, Fig. 1, Plate 111.—The posterior portion of the circumference of the neck of the femur, internal to the muscle attachments to the trochanter major and minor of the femur (Plates 99 and 100), affords attachment to the external end of this portion of the capsular ligament. Its internal attachment is to the posterior part of the rim and of the exterior surface of the cotyloid cav- ity of the os innominatum. Dissection.—Turn the pelvis upon the block with its anterior surface up- permost. 2. Anterior Portion of the Capsular Ligament, Plate 112, and Fig. 1, Plate 66.—The capsular ligament is continued cir- cumferentially from its posterior portion, around the neck of

HEAD AND NECK. 422 28. Tlialamu§ Opticus.—A portion of the superior surface —the anterior tubercle—of this body—one of the posterior, basal, cerebral ganglia—presents, at the floor of the cavity of a lateral ventricle, between a taenia semicircularis, externally, and a choroid plexus, internally. Dissection.—Section the fornix at the anterior section line in Fig. 1, Plate 217 ; reflect the anterior and posterior portions as in Fig. 2, Plate 217. (This is done with the handle of the scalpel, which slides it off from the superior sur- face of the velum interpositum). 29. Anterior Pillar§ of the Fornix, Plates 214, 216, and 217 ; Fig. 1, Plate 218.—These are the anterior reflections of the for- nix—a right and a left pillar—which pass, inferiorly, to the base of the brain, where they terminate as the corpora mammillaria, before described (page 416) and illustrated (Plate 214). 30. Velum Interpositum, Fig. 2, Plate 217 ; Fig. 1, Plate 218.—This is a triangular, intraventricular, portion of the pia mater of the brain, which is projected, anteriorly, from the inferior surfaces of the occipital lobes of the cerebral hemi- spheres ; it enters the lateral ventricle, inferiorly to the sple- nium of the corpus callosum and the body of the fornix. Its borders support the choroid plexuses. 31. Intraventricular Veins, Plates 216 and 217.—These are small veins, which ramify in the interior walls of the lateral ventricles. They converge to a right and a left vessel, which curve, internally, to enter posteriorly to the anterior pillars of the fornix (Plate 217); they pass inferiorly to the velum inter- positum, where they become the vence Galeni. Dissection.—Cut (Fig. 2, Plate 217) the veins emptying into the venae Galeni ; dissect away the intraventricular veins. Turn off, as in Fig. 1, Plate 218, the velum interpositum, and the right and left choroid plexus, posteriorly, upon the reflected posterior portion of the fornix (Fig. 2, Plate 217). 32. Vena? Galeni, Fig. 2, Plate 217 ; Fig. 1, Plate 218.— These are two antero-posterior veins, which run parallel with, and at either side of, the median line, at the inferior surface of the velum interpositum. 33. Choroid Plexus of the Third Ventricle of the Brain, Fig. 1, Plate 218.—The anterior ends of the choroid plexuses of

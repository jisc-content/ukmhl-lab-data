INTRODUCTION. 3 body. Special terms, applicable to special dissections, will be given in their proper places. DISSECTING INSTRUMENTS. Dissecting Instruments, Plate 1.—Experience has proved, that the following instruments, etc., will meet all the wants of the dissector, and in some respects, better than the contents of the conventional dissecting case : a pair of modified Coxeter forceps, two scalpels, a pair of sharp-pointed curved scissors, chain-hooks, thumb-pins, clasp-pins, two probes, and a scalpel strop. As contained in their case (1), they fulfil the ends of compactness, usefulness and economy. Forceps.—The forceps (2) is the " Coxeter forceps," modified by having its head cut square across, so that, when the closed blades are held in the hand, it may be used to strip muscles apart, etc. Scalpels—Each scalpel has a thick handle; a portion of the blade forms a shank to the knife, which strengthens the instrument, facilitates its manipulation, and limits its cutting portion to its available edge. One of the scalpels (3) has a rounded end, and a very convex cutting edge, which continues to the end of the blade; this scalpel is adapted for coarse work, such as reflecting flaps of skin, etc., and clearing fas- ciae and muscles. The pointed scalpel (4) has a very convex cutting edge, and is intended for delicate work on nerves and vessels. These two knives will fulfill all the requirements of dissection. Curved Scissors.—The sharp-pointed curved scissors (5) pre- sents nothing peculiar. As an instrument for the dissector, it should be much more used than it is; after a little practice, it can with great advantage, in many instances, be made to take the place of the scalpel. As a scissors, it answers all the needs of a straight pair. Chain-Hooks—The chain-hooks (6) have blunt points, and the chain is very strong. Thread—The dissector should provide himself with coarse linen thread, and a needle for the same. Flaps may be advan-

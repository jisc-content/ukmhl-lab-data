288 UPPER EXTREMITY. lar ligament of the shoulder-joint. It is attached : internally, to the ridges on the anterior surface of the scapula ; externally, to the inner tuberosity of the humerus. Dissection.—Section the serratus magnus muscle (Plate 157); the anterior of the thorax, the anterior of the neck, and the region of the back having been dissected, this section of the serratus magnus muscle will sever the upper ex- tremity from the trunk. POSTEEIOE OF THE SHOULDER AND ARM. Dissection.—Extend the upper extremity—detached from the trunk—with its posterior surface uppermost. Elex the elbow, so as to put the muscles of the posterior of the arm upon the stretch. Terms of Relation.—The general terms anterior audi poste- rior (page 2); and the special terms proximal and distal (to- ward, and from, the trunk), and inner and outer, are used to locate parts in this portion of the dissection. Bones and Bone Areas of Muscle Attachments, Plate 158 —The posterior surfaces of the scapula, the clavicle, the humerus, and the proximal end of the ulna, form the osseous framework of this portion of the dissection. All of these bone surfaces afford areas for muscle attachments. Dissection.—When the dissections of the anterior of the arm and of the back have preceded that of this dissection, make skin incisions 1 and 2 of Fig- ure 12, and dissect away the skin from the arm. Where the anterior of the arm and the back have not been dissected make the skin incisions 1, 2, and 3, of Figure 12, and reflect flaps as indicated. Find and trace the nerves in the sub- cutaneous plane, and clear the surface of the fascia.

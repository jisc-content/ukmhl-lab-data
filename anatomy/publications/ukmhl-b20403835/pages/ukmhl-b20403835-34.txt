INTRODUCTION. 12 surfaces of the bones. In other joints (hip-joint) the articu- lar cavities are deepened by the rimming of their borders with immovable fibro-cartilage (circumferential). In the articula- tion of bones, which form partially movable joints (the verte- bras), cartilage and synovial membrane are wanting, and plates of immovable, fibro-cartilage (interosseous) are fixed between the articular surfaces (intervertebral discs); these latter points of bone articulation allow a slight motion of their surfaces upon each other. In the immovable joints (cranial and upper- jaw regions of the head) the articular surfaces of the bones are held in apposition : for the cranium, by the continuity of the exterior periosteum and the interior dura mater ; for the upper-jaw region, by the continuity of the periosteum ; ulti- mately, in both regions, the articulations between the bones are obliterated by the development of osseous tissue. Dissection.â€”In the dissection of joints it is absolutely necessary that they should be moist and pliable ; to keep them so, they should be kept covered by refuse tissue, with wrappings of wet muslin, and outside dry muslin or oil-silk. If they have dried from neglect, they should be soaked in water till the liga- ments are again pliable. The cleaning of the surface of ligaments may be effected with curved scissors and subsequent scraping with a scalpel.

PRACTICAL HUMAN ANATOMY. INTRODUCTION. It is, for the following reasons, of the greatest importance that the dissector read this introduction, carefully, before com- mencing his dissections: first, that lie may be prepared to use this work to the greatest possible advantage ; second, that he may have a general appreciation of the anatomical elements that he is to meet with ; third, that he may obtain a general idea of how to dissect the several parts which enter into the make-up of the body; fourth, that he may know the relative importance of the parts exposed in a given dissection, and thereby be guided, as to which to preserve and which to cut away, as he progresses, WOKKING PLAN. Director's Use of this Work.—The following course should be pursued with a given dissection : first, read, consecutively, the numbered descriptive-anatomy paragraphs (in large type), referring to the Plates as directed therein ; second, read, con- tinuously, the dissection paragraphs (in small type), referring to the Plates as indicated therein ; third, dissect in strict ac- cordance with the directions given in the dissection paragraphs ; fourth, verify dissections by the Plates and by the text of the descriptive-anatomy paragraphs. Plate References.—When a given Plate, say 51, is referred to in a descriptive-anatomy paragraph heading, the dissector is to continue to work with Plate 51, until another Plate or other Plates, say 52, or 55, 57, and 59, is or are referred to,

SECOND DISSECTION. FEMALE PERINEUM. Position of the Body fob Dissection, Figure 2 (page 31).—Place the sub- ject in the same position as for dissection of the male perineum, page 13. Regional Appearances.—Palpation recognizes the same bone contours as in the male ; see Male Perineum, page 13. As compared with the male, the region presents the following differences : in the greater diameters of the pelvic outlet; in the anus being located nearer the coccyx ; and in the external genitalia. Terms of Relation.—See Male Perineum, page 13. Perineum and its Boundaries, Plate 5.—The female peri- neum includes all the soft parts, closing the outlet of the pelvis. It is bounded by bones and ligaments, as in the male ; see Male Perineum, page 13. Regions of the Female Perineum—The transverse or bis- ischiatic line of the pelvic outlet divides the female perineum into the rectal region, posteriorly, and the urethrovaginal region, anteriorly ; see Male Perineum, page 14. Bone-Areas—See Male Perineum, page 14. External (exterior) Genitalia. — These parts occupy the urethro-vaginal region of the perineum and the anterior sur- faces of the ossa pubis ; they collectively form the pudendum, which presents, antero-posteriorly, the uro-genital furrow. They include : a, Mons veneris ; b, Labia majora ; c, Clitoris ; d, Labia minora; e, Vestibule;/, Meatus urinarius ; g, Vag- inal orifice ; h, Orifices of the ducts of the vulvo-vaginal glands ; i, Fourchette ; j, Fossa navicularis ; Jc, Vulvo-vaginal glands and their ducts (described page 38).

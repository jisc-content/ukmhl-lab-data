LOWER EXTREMITY. NINTH DISSECTION. ANTERIOR OF THIGH. Dissection.—Place a block under the pelvis to raise the proximal ends of the lower extremities; extend the limbs at full length with the heels upon the table. Terms of Relation,—Those applied are : the general terms anterior and posterior (page 2); the special terms proximal and distal (toward and from the trunk, respectively); inner and outer (to the respective lateral surfaces) ; also, the com- pound terms antero-inner and outer, and postero-inner and outer. Bones and Bone Areas, Plate 59 and Fig. 1, Plate 91.—The bone surfaces of the dissection are : the anterior border of the ilium and the exterior surfaces of the os pubis and ischium of the os innominatum ; the anterior surfaces of the femur, the patella, and of the proximal ends of the tibia and fibula. The areas for muscle attachments are : of the os innominatum, at the anterior border of its ilial and the exterior of its pubic and ischial portions ; of the femur, its anterior and postero- inner surfaces; of the patella, its borders; of the tibia, the antero-inner and outer surfaces of its proximal end. Dissection.—The skin incisions for this dissection are indicated in Fig. 4, lines 1, 2 and 3. When this dissection is consecutive to that of the abdomen, skin incision 1 will have been made, as the line of the same describes about that of Poupart's ligament. 1. Subcutaneous Tissue.—This plane of tis- sue varies in thickness; it consists of two layers Figure 4. —superficial and deep—between which the superficial veins and nerves ramify.

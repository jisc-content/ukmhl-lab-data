PARTS OF THE BRAITT. 429 are projected postero-inferiorly from the right and left testis, respectively, of the corpora quadrigemina, to the cerebellum ; they are the superior or cerebrum peduncles of the cerebellum (page 426 ; Fig. 2, Plate 220). 4§. Valve of Vieussens and the Fourth Pair of Cranial or the Trochlear Serves.—This valve is a sheet of grey neural tissue, that bridges between the internal borders of the processi e cerebello ad testes ; upon the superior surface of its posterior portion the lingula (Pig. 2, Plate 220) of the cerebellum is lodged. From the superior surface of its anterior portion the fourth pair of cranial or the trochlear nerves take their exte- rior origins. Dissection.—Return the portion of brain to its former position, as in Fig, 1, Plate 222. 49. Crura Cerebri or Cerebral Peduncles, Plate 214 ; Fig. 1, Plate 222.—These were partly described (page 415) and illus- trated (Plate 214). They diverge, right and left, from the an- terior of the pons Varolii; they are projected from the latter to the basal ganglia of the cerebrum—the thalami optici and the corpora striata. The third pair of cranial or the trochlear nerves wind over their external, to their inferior, surfaces ; and the third pair of cranial or oculomotor nerves have their exterior origins from their internal surfaces. 50. Pons Varolii, Plates 211 and 214 ; Fig. 1, Plate 220 ; Fig. 1, Plate 222.—This part of the brain, before referred to (page 216 ; Plate 214), is the commissure between the other three parts of the organ. Its inferior, and exterior, fibres are transversely commisural between the hemispheres of the cere- bellum, forming its right and left middle or pons Varolii pe- duncles (page 422 ; Plates 214 and 220 ; Fig. 1, Plates 221). Its interior and superior, substance is longitudinally commissural between the medulla oblongata and the cerebrum. Its postero- superior surface contributes to the floor of the fourth ventricle (Fig. 3, Plate 222). The fifth pair of cranial or trifacial nerves (a sensory and a motor root) emerge from the anterior of its lateral portion. 51. Medulla Oblongata, Plates 211 and 214 ; Fig. 1, Plate 220 ; Plate 222.—This portion of the brain was before referred

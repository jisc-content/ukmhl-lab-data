ANTERIOR OF ELBOW, FOREARM, AND HAND. 235 the ulna (Plate 121), the radioulnar interosseous ligament, and the pronator quadratus muscle ; be careful to preserve the interosseous artery and its branches ; also, the anterior interosseous nerve upon the anterior surface of the radio ulnar interosseous ligament. Cut away the flexor longus pollicis muscle from the radius (Plate 121) and the pronator quadratus muscle. Out away the proximal portions of the pronator radii teres, the flexor carpi ra- dialis, the flexor sublimis digitorum, and the palmaris longus muscles, as in Fig. 1, Plate 134. 101. Interosseous Arteries, Plate 130, and Fig. 1, Plate 134. —The ulnar gives off the common interosseous artery (page 225 and 226), which divides into the posterior and the anterior interosseous arteries. The posterior interosseous artery (venre comites) perforates the raclio-ulnar interosseous ligament to reach the posterior region of the forearm. The anterior inter- osseous artery (vense comites) has a distal course, reaching the .anterior surface of the radio-ulnar interosseous ligament, be- tween the liexor profundus digitorum and the flexor longus pollicis muscles (Plate 130) ; it runs parallel with the nerve of the same name, and passes to the dorsal surface of the prona- tor quadratus muscle. Its branches supply contiguous mus- cles, and some of them perforate to the posterior region of the forearm. 102. Anterior Interosseous Nerve.—This nerve, branch of the median nerve (page 225), after having passed between the flexor longus pollicis and the flexor profundus digitorum mus- cles (Plate 130), to reach the deep plane of the anterior of the forearm, has a distal course, upon the radio-ulnar interosseous ligament, to where it passes to the posterior surface of the pronator quadratus muscle. It accompanies the last-described artery. 103. Pronator Quadratus Muscle, Plates 121, 1.28, 129, 130 ; and Figs. 1 and 2, Plate 134—This muscle is located, trans- versely, across the distal portion of the anterior surface of the forearm. It is attached (Plate 121) to the anterior surfaces of the radius and the ulna, respectively, well over the inner side of the former. 104. Biceps Muscle, Plates 121, 128, 129, 130, and Fig. 1, Plate 134.—The distal end of the tendon of this muscle passes, around the inner side of the tubercle of the radius, to reach its

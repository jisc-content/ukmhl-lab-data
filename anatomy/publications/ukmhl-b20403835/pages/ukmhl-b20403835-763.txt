AJSTTEKO-LATEKiAL AEEA OF THE KECK. 361 19. Stcrno-hyoid Muscle, Fig. 2, Plate 135 and Plates 190, 192, 193, and 194.—This muscle was before referred to (pages 238 and 359). It is attached: superiorly, to the hyoid bone (Plate 190); inferiorly, to the interior surface of the superior portion of the sternum, and to the posterior surface of the in- ternal end of the clavicle (Fig. 2, Plate 135). It should there- fore be named sterno-cleido-hyoid muscle. 20. Internal Jugular Vein, Plates 192 to 195, inclusive.— This large venous trunk appears in the neck, from the internal surface, and inferior border, of the posterior belly of the digas- tric muscle. It passes inferiorly, anteriorly to the rectus capitis anticus major muscle, to its confluence with the subclavian vein, posteriorly to the internal third of the clavicle. In the superior third of its cervical course it receives the facial vein (page 359). 21. Descendens and Communicans Noni Nerves.—The de- scendens noni nerve, branch of the hypoglossal nerve (page 365), passes inferiorly, parallel with, and anteriorly and inter- nally to, the last-described vein ; it gives off a nerve to the omo-liyoid (anterior belly). The communicans noni nerve (Plates 194 and 195), branch of the anterior division of the third cervical-spinal nerve, has an inferior course, anteriorly to the rectus capitis anticus major muscle and the internal jugular vein. It runs posteriorly to the omo-hyoid muscle (anterior belly), to its communication with the descendens noni nerve, thereby forming the noni loop. A branch from the loop sup- plies the omo-hyoid (posterior belly), sterno- (cleido-) hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles (Plates 194 and 195). 22. Anterior Division of the Third Cervical-spinal Nerve, Plates 194,196, and 197.—This nerve appears from between the rectus capitis anticus major and the scalenus medius muscles. It receives a communicating branch from the second cervical- spinal nerve (Plate 196). It gives off the above-described com- municans noni nerve; the occipitalis minor, auricularis mag- nus, and superficial cervical nerves, and the nerve to the trape- zius muscle (page 357); also, the nerve to the levator anguli scapula muscle (Plates 194 and 196), which crosses the scalenus medius muscle. 23. Anterior Division of the Fourth Cervical-spinal Nerve. —This division of the fourth cervical-spinal nerve appears in

230 UPPER EXTREMITY. digitorum (perforatus) muscle splits opposite the phalanx of a digit ; the portions continue distally, curling so as to bring their dorsal surfaces uppermost, and then unite ; the splitting and reunion of the tendon forms a button-hole-like channel (Plate 131) ; the reunited portions split again, the slips pass- ing to be attached to the halves of the palmar surface of the phalangine of a digit. A tendon of the flexor profundus digitornm (perforans) muscle enters upon the palmar surface of the phalanx of a digit to the dorsal surface of a sublimis tendon, it then passes through the opening in a tendon of the flexor sublimis digitornm (perforatus), and is continued, upon the phalangine, to its attachment to the palmar surface of the base of the phalangette. The tendons, as lodged in their sheaths (page 223), are held to the phalanges and phalangines of the digits, by folds of synovial membrane lining the sheath of, and covering, the tendons—vinculo, accessoria tendinum; by these, vessels pass to and from tendons. 89. Lumbricales Muscles, Plates 127, 129, 131, 132, and 133.—These four muscles were located in the palmar interten- dinous spaces (pages 221, 222, and 223) ; they have their prox- imal attachments to the outer sides of the metacarpal portions of the tendons of the flexor profundus digitorum muscle ; they pass in a distal direction to the webbing between the digits, where they have been described (pages 221, 222, and 223).pass- ing to the dorsal surfaces of the phalanges of the digits, sec- ond to fifth, inclusive. 90. Flexor Longus Pollicis Muscle, Plates 121, and 127 to 131, inclusive.—This muscle extends, from its proximal at- tachment to the anterior surface of the shaft of the ulna, through the forearm ; its tendon crosses the carpus, posteriorly to the anterior annular ligament, into the pollex eminence, where it is lodged between the heads of the flexor brevis polli- cis muscle ; from there, it is projected upon the palmar surface of the first or pollex digit, to its distal attachment to the palmar surface of the base of the phalangette of the same. Dissection.—Section the tendons of the flexor profundus digitorum mus- cle, also the lumbricales muscles (Plate 131) ; reflect the tendons and the lumbricales muscles off of the digits. In reflecting the third and fourth lum-| bricales muscles find their nerves, from the deep palmar nerve, entering their dorsal surfaces (Plate 132) ; leave the nerves in situ for appreciation later on

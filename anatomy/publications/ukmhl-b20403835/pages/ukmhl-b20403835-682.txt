316 UPPER EXTREMITY. 5. Tendon of Biceps within the Shoulder-joint.—The ten- don of the long head of the biceps enters, by the bicipital groove of the humerus, the interior surface of the superior portion of the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint ; it passes to be attached to-the superior part of the glenoid ligament. SCAPULO-CLAVICULAE AKTICTJLATION AND SCAPULAE LIGAMENTS. Dissection.—Clear the acromio-clavicular, the coraco-clavicular, coraco- acromial, and suprascapular ligaments. Terms of Relation.—The same as for the description of the shoulder-joint. Bones, Plates 113, 158, and 176.—These are the clavicle- its external half ; and the scapula—its acromion and coracoid processes, and its superior border. 1. Acromio-clavicular Articulation.—The external end of the clavicle is received at a facet on the internal border of the acromion process of the scapula, where it is held by the superior acromio-clavicular and the inferior acromio-clavic- ular ligaments. 2. Coraco-clavicular Ligament.—This extends from the inferior surface of the external half of the clavicle to the su- perior surface and posterior border of the angle of the coracoid process of the scapula. It is sometimes described as the cono- trapezoid ligament, having two portions : anteriorly and ex- ternally, the trapezoid portion ; posteriorly and internally, the conoid portion. 3. Coraco-acromial Ligament, Plate 113, and Fig. 1, Plate 176.—This is a stretch, of fibrous tissue from the anterior bor- der of the acromion process of the scapula to the superior border of the external portion of its coracoid process. 4. Suprascapular Ligament, Fig. 2, Plate 176.—This is a band of fibrous tissue, that bridges the suprascapular notch, converting the same into a foramen.

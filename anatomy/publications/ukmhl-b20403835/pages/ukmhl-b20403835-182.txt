TRUNK. 84 45. Obturator Interims Muscle, Plates 39, 40, 45, and 46. —The inferior portion of this muscle was referred to in the dissection of the male perineum (page 17). It is attached to the interior surface of the obturator membrane and the bony circumference surrounding the same (Fig. 1, Plate 45). From this attachment its tendon leaves the pelvic cavity by the small sacro-sciatic foramen, being projected therefrom into the glu- teal region (Plate 100). 46. Ligaments of the Abdominal and Pelvic Interiors, Plates 42 and 45.—These ligaments present as follows : upon the anterior surfaces of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, the anterior common ligament of the spinal column; from the transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra to the posterior superior spinous process of the ilium, the ilio-lumbar ligament; from the anterior surface of the lateral portion of the sacrum to the interior of the ilium, the anterior sacro-iliac ligament; from the spine of the ischium to the sacrum and coccyx, the small sacro-sciatic ligament; from the sacrum to the body of the ischium, the great sacro-sciatic ligament; from the anterior surface of the inferior segment of the sacrum to the anterior of the coccyx, the anterior sacro-coccygeal ligament; at the sym- physis pubis the posterior, superior and inferior pubic liga- ments. Dissection.—If the dissector has the lower extremity assigned to him with the abdomen, he should continue his work by dissecting the anterior surface of the thigh ; if he has the trunk region—abdomen, pelvis and thorax—he should take up the dissection of the anterior parietes of the thorax. The demonstra- tion of the abdominal and pelvic viscera will now be given, as they naturally complete the abdomen and pelvis; but the dissector should leave them till after he has finished the dissection of the lower extremity or thorax, according to the assignment of the subject.

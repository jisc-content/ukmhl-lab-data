354 HEAD AND NECK. 17. Styloid Process of Temporal Bone; Stylo-nyoid, Stylo- glossus, and Stylo-pharyngeus Muscles, Fig. 2, Plate 188, and Plate 190.—The styloid process, of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, has a variable length, and from it the stylo-hyoid ligament is continued to the small cornu of the hyoid bone (Plate 190). It affords attachments to the superior ends of the three stylo muscles, which pass, as their names imply, to the hyoid bone, tongue, and pharynx. 18. Qlosso-pharyngeal and Spinal Accessory Nerves, Fig. 2, Plate 188.—The superior ends of the extracranial portions of these nerves present as follows : the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, posteriorly to, and between, the internal carotid artery and the styloid process ; the spinal accessory nerve, posteriorly to, and between, the styloid process and the posterior auricular artery, to the point where it passes internally to the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. 19. Posterior Auricular Artery, Plates 187 and 188.—This artery (vena3 comites) is given off from the external carotid artery, where the latter is located internally to the inferior end of the posterior portion of the parotid gland. It passes, supe- riorly and posteriorly, under cover of the gland, supplying it, the auricle of the ear, and the scalp (page 320 ; Plate 177).

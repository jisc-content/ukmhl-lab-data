TWELFTH DISSECTION. POSTERIOR REGION OF THE LEG AND THE POP- LITEAL SPACE. Dissection.—Extend the limb with its posterior surface uppermost; place blocks under the pelvis, thigh, and ankle, respectively ; secure the foot at a right angle to the leg. Term§ of Relation.—Proximal (toward the trunk), distal (from the trunk), inner side, outer side, anterior surface, and posterior surface will be used to indicate the relations of parts. Bone Areas, Plate 83.—The posterior surface of the calca- neum, the astragalus, the tibia, the fibula, and the distal end of the femur form the osseous plane of this dissection ; with the exception of the astrag- alus, all these bones afford attachments to muscles presenting in this dissection. Dissection.—Make the skin incisions 1, 2, and 3 of Figure 7, and reflect lateral flaps as indicated. When the dissection of the posterior surface of the leg is consecutive to that of the an- terior, the skin flaps will have to be removed. Determine the saphenous veins and nerves. 1. Subcutaneous Tissue, Plate 84.—This plane of tissue presents the ramifications of superficial veins and nerves. 2. External Saphenous Vein.—At about the middle of the leg this vein perforates the fascia ; it runs, through the distal half of the dissection area, to the external malleolus, where it passes, distal to the same, into the minim half of the dorsal surface of the foot (page 124 ; Plate 69).

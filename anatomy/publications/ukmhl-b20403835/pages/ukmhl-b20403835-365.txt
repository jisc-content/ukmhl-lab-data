ternal cutaneous nerve, from the lumbar plexus (page 109 ; THIRTEENTH DISSECTION. GLUTEAL REGION AND POSTERIOR REGION OF THE THIGH. Dissection.—Place a block under the anterior of the pelvis; extend the limb, rotate the thigh inwards, and let the knee, leg, and foot rest upon the table. Terms of Relation.—To the gluteal region the general terms of relation are applicable (page 2) ; to the thigh region the terms proximal, distal, inner side, outer side, anterior surface and posterior surface will be applied. Bone Areas, Plate 91.—The exteriors of the os innominatum, the sacrum, and the coccyx, and the posterior surfaces of the femur and the proximal ends of the tibia and fibula form the osseous plane of the dissection. All these bones afford areas for muscle attachments. Dissection.—Make the skin incisions 1, 2, and 3 of Figure 8, and reflect lateral flaps as indicated. Where the dissection of the anterior of the thigh has been made, the skin may be dissected off. 1. Subcutaneous Tissue.—This tissue is thicker and denser than that of the ante- rior of the thigh ; the veins and nerves are | much smaller and less numerous. Dissection.—Clear away the subcutaneous tissue from the fascia, preserving, as far as possible, the subcutaneous nerves and veins. 2. Subcutaneous Werves, Plate 92.—Branches of the ex-

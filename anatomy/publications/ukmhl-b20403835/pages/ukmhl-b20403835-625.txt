UPPER EXTREMITY. TWENTIETH DISSECTION. ANTERIOR SCAPULAR MUSCLES; POSTERIOR OF SHOULDER AND ARM. ANTEBIOR SCAPULAR MUSCLES. Dissection.—The subject should be in the same position as for the nine- teenth dissection, and the latter dissection should have been completed. Re- flect the upper extremity so as to apply its posterior surface to the posterior surface of the thorax. Terms of Relation.—These are the general terms (page 2), and special terms, applied to the thorax, of exterior and antero- lateral. Bones and Bone Areas, Plate 113.—The anterior surface of the scapula, and the exterior surfaces of the anterolateral area, of the eight or nine superior ribs, form the osseous framework of the region occupied by the anterior scapular muscles. Dissection.—Expose the exterior surface of the serratus magnus muscle, and the anterior surface of the subscapulars muscle. 1. Serratus Magnus Muscle, Plates 113 and 157.—This mus- cle is attached : anteriorly, by nine serrations, to the exterior surfaces of the nine superior ribs ; posteriorly, to the anterior edge of the posterior border of the body of the scapula. It swathes the anterodateral area of the thorax, where a portion of it forms the inner wall of the axilla (page 196 ; Plates 116, 117, 119, and 120). 2. Subscapular!* Muscle.—This muscle is lodged in the subscapular fossa ; it crosses the anterior surface of the capsu-

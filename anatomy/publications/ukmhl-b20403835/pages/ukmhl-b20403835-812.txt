HEAD AND NECK. 390 the tongue and larynx. Clear the right lateral surface of the tongue (Fig. 1, Plate 205) so as to display the tongue portions of: the lingual artery ; the gustatory, glossopharyngeal, and hypoglossal nerves; the sublingual glandular tissue ; the perforation of the mucous membrane of the buccal floor by the duct of the submaxillary gland; and the, complete, external surface of the genio-hyo-glossus muscle. 8. Lingual Artery and its Branc!ie§: Plates 192 to 197, in- clusive ; Plates 200, 201, 203, and 204 ; and Fig. 1, Plate 205. —This artery (vena comes), branch of the external carotid artery (page 367 ; Plates 192 to 197, inclusive), has a superior course from its origin, to the point where it turns to run in- ternally, parallel with and superiorly to, the hyoid bone. Its tongue portion (Plate 204 ; and Fig. 1, Plate 205) enters be- tween the hyo-glossus and middle constrictor muscles, and is continued, anteriorly, between the hyo-glossus and genio-hyo- glossus muscles ; it appears in the anterior angle formed by the stylo-glossus and hyo-glossus muscles, where it bifurcates into the sublingual and ranine arteries (Fig. 1, Plate 205). Branches of the lingual artery are: the hyoid, given off before the entrance of the artery internally to the hyo-glossus muscle (Plate 204); the dorsal artery of the tongue, arising internally to the hyo-glossus muscle, near its posterior border, has a superior course to the posterior of the tongue (Plate 204 ; Fig. 1, Plate 205); the sublingual, one of its branches of bifur- cation, runs, anteriorly, on the external surface of the anterior portion of the genio-hyo-glossus muscle ; the ranine, a branch of bifurcation, distributes to the anterior of the organ and ter- minates in the superior of the fraenum of the mucous membrane of the tongue, where it has a direct anastomosis with its fellow of the opposite side. 9. Glossopharyngeal Werve: Plate 204 ; Fig. 1, Plate 205.— The superior portion of this nerve has been described (pages 368 and 379) and illustrated (Plates 200 and 201). It enters be- tween the hyo-glossus muscle, externally, and the lingual por- tion of the superior constrictor muscle, internally (Plate 204). It is continued to the external face of the genio-hyo-glossus muscle (Fig. 1, Plate 205), where its branches enter the submu- cous plane of the posterior lateral parts of the tongue, for ultimate distribution to the papillae of that area of its mucous membrane.

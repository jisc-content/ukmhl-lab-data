PREFACE. This work was commenced with a desire—after an ex- perience of nearly twenty years in study, actual dissections, and the teaching of anatomy—to produce a practical working- guide for the student at the cadaver, and a ready-reference book, which would take the place of the cadaver, for prac- titioners of surgery and medicine. The plan of the work embraces the following points : 1st, the division of the body into practical dissections ; 2d, the giving, in dissection-paragraphs, the progressive steps by which the several parts, involved in a dissection, are to be systematically displayed ; 3d, the guidance, by lines across the parts in the Plates— called section-lines—to the points where they are to be cut, for their reflection, in order to advance to a succeeding stage of the dissection ; 4th, the indication, by numbering the parts of the dissec- tions, of the order in which they are exposed ; 5th, the description of the parts, in descriptive-anatomy paragraphs, as they are brought into view; 6th, the adherence, in expressing the relations of parts, to a well-defined nomenclature of general and special anatomical terms ; 7th, the illustration of the anatomy of the regions and vis- cera of the body by Plates, with the names of the parts printed upon them or at the sides of the Figures with indicating lines to them—the dead-anatomy is thus presented to the student, and the living-anatomy to the surgeon and physician. The dissections have been planned, as far as practicable, to give all the attachments of included muscles. Each dissection has been completely described and illus-

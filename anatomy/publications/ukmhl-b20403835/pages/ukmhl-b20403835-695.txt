TWENTY-THIRD DISSECTION. SCALP; VERTEX PORTION OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN ; INTERIOR OF THE BASE OF THE CRANIUM. Dissection.—The subject is placed as for dissection of the thorax, and upper extremities (page 193); the head is so steadied upon a block as to present one of its lateral surfaces uppermost (Plate 177). Terms of Relation.—These are : the general terms (page 2); and the special terms frontal, lateral, occipital, and vertex surfaces or areas applied to the exterior of the cranium ; exterior and interior, used relatively to the cranial cavity. Bones, and Bone Areas of Musele Attachments, Plates 181 and 189.—Parts of the frontal, parietal, sphenoid, temporal, and occipital bones form the vault of the cranium. At the lateral and occipital surfaces of the cranium the bones present areas for the attachments of muscles. Parts of the frontal, eth- moid, sphenoid, temporal, and occipital bones contribute to form the base of the cranium. SCALP. Dissection.—Make the skin incisions 1 and 2, of Figure 14 (page 318), and reflect a flap as indicated. Care must be taken to reflect the skin only,' that the vessels and nerves of the subcutaneous plane may be left in situ. ' As a guide for the hairy portion of the scalp, the roots of the hairs should be ex- posed projecting from the interior of the flap. 1. Subcutaneous Tissue.—This plane of the scalp differs from the same tissue of other regions*: in being very dense ; and in its intimate blending with the skin, exteriorly, and the musculo-aponeurotic layer, interiorly. Dissection.—Trace through the frontal area of the subcutaneous tissue the frontal artery, the supratrochlear nerve, and the anterior branch of the super- ficial temporal artery. Expose the surface of the frontal portion of the occipito- frontalis muscle.

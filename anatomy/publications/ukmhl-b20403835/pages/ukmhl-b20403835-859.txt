The parietal lobe is bounded: at the median line, by the longitudinal fissure (Plates 212 and 215) ; anteriorly, by the furrow of Rolando (Plates 212, 213, and 215) ; posteriorly, by the occipitoparietal fissure ; in- feriorly, by the fissure of Sylvius and the temporo-sphenoidal lobe (Plate 213). The occipital lobe (Plates 212, 213, and 214) is bounded: at the median line, by the posterior part of the longitudinal fissure ; anteriorly, by the occipito-paiietal fis- sure ; inferiorly, by the cerebellum. The temporo-splienoidal lobe (Plate 213) is bounded : superiorly, by the fissure of Sylvius and the parietal lobe ; as a free portion of the cere- brum, it is lodged posteriorly to the frontal lobe, and exter- nally to the central lobe. The central lobe is located at the floor of the fissure of Sylvius, where it is bounded : superiorly, by the operculum of the frontal and parietal lobes (Plates 213 and 214); anteriorly, by the frontal lobe (Plates 213 and 214); internally, at the base of the cerebrum, by the anterior per- forated space (Plate 214). Dissections.—Section the right hemisphere of the cerebrum so as to slice off its vertex portion, as in Plate 215. Cut away the anterior border of the left temporo-sphenoidal lobe, as in Plate 214 Demonstrate the convolutions and lobules of the five lobes of the cerebrum as determined by sulci, which present with variable degrees of uniformity and definition in different brains. 3. Convolutions and Sulci of a Frontal Lobe, Plates 212 to 215, inclusive.—The convolutions of this lobe may be demon- strated as follows : at its vertex and external-lateral surfaces, the ascending frontal (Plates 212, 213, and 215) lies parallel with, and between the furrow of Rolando, posteriorly, and the transverse frontal sulcus, anteriorly; the superior frontal, the middle frontal, and the inferior frontal divided by the superior frontal sulcus and the inferior frontal sulcus, are anteriorly to the ascending frontal sulcus, and run postero-an- teriorly, therefrom ; at its inferior surface, the posterior orbi- tal, the anterior orbital, and the internal orbital (Plate 214) are determined by the orbital sulcus; at its internal-lateral surface, or the wall of the longitudinal fissure, the marginal convolution, and the convolution of the corpus callosum, are defined by the calloso marginal sulcus. 4.

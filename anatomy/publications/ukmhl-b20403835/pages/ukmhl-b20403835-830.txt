Ethmoidal Cells.—These are small cavities in, and re- sult from the honeycombed structure of, the lateral masses of the ethmoid bone. In each lateral mass of the bone, these cells are divided into two, non-communicating, sets of cells, the posterior and the anterior. By their respective openings into a nasal cavity—the posterior ethmoidal opening and the infundibulum—they receive a lining of mucous membrane ; vessels, and nerves, also pass to them from the nasal cavity, through the submucous plane.

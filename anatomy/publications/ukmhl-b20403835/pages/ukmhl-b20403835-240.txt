106 TRUNK. 12) and female (page 41; Fig. 2, Plate 20). This, the terminal eight inches of the large intestine, presents two curvatures, which form its three portions, viz.: first, second, and third. The first portion extends to the first curvature ; the second, be- tween the curvatures, has a postero-inferior convexity and an antero-superior concavity ; the third portion, beyond the sec- ond curvature, tips posteriorly, and terminates at the anus, where it is surrounded by the sphincter ani muscle. The rec- tum differs from the colon of the large intestine : first, in the absence of the three longitudinal bands of the latter; second, in the absence of appendices epiploicse. In unfolding the rectum, as directed, note a contraction at the anus, produced by the external and internal sphincters ; a dilatation within the anus ; and a bend in the gut at the junc- tion of its second and first portions. In structure, the walls of the rectum will be found to pre- sent an exterior, partial, peritoneal coat (pages 67 and 95), a muscular coat, a submucous coat and an interior mucous coat. In the muscular coat the fibres are both longitudinal and circular : the longitudinal fibres are distributed to the en- tire circumference of the canal, presenting lateral thickenings of the same, by which an attempt at a right and left muscle- band are determined. The sphincter ani muscle surrounds the anal orifice, and the fibres of the levator ani portion of the levator ani et prostatse or levator ani et vaginae muscle reach the wall of the rectum, beneath the plane of the sphincter ani muscle (page 25 ; Plates 10, 11, and 12).

Braehiali§ Anticus Muscle, Plates 121, 126, 128, 129, 130 ; and Fig. 1, Plate 134.—The distal end of this muscle is attached to the anterior surface of the proximal end of the ulna, distal to its coronoid process. 106. Supinator Brevis Muscle.—The anterior surface of this muscle presents between the tendon of the biceps and the extensor carpi radialis brevior muscle, being attached to the anterior surface, and outer side, of the radius, between the head and oblique line of the bone. It also has an an- terior attachment to the outer side of the coronoid process of the ulna. Dissection.—Section the pronator quadratus muscle, and reflect its por- tions (Fig. 2, Plate 134). Trace the anterior interosseous artery : its branches to the pronator quadratus muscle ; and its anastomoses with the arteries at the anterior of. the carpus. Expose the distribution of the anterior interos- seous nerve to the pronator quadratus muscle and to the carpus. 10-7. Anterior Carpal Arteries, Plate 134.—At the anterior of the carpus there are the free anastomoses of the anterior ra- dial carpal, the anterior ulnar carpal, the recurrent carpal, and the anterior interosseous (terminal branches) arteries. 108. Terminal Diitribution of the Anterior Interos§eou§ Xerve, Fig. 2, Plate 134.—This nerve has a terminal distribu- tion to the pronator quadratus muscle and to the anterior of the joints of the carpus. Dissection.—Keep the anterior surfaces of the hand, forearm, elbow, and shoulder articulations, thoroughly moist and soft, for their subsequent dissec- tion.

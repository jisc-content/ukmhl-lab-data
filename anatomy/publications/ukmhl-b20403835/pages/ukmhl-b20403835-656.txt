TJPPEB EXTREMITY. 306 37. Dorsal Branches of the Palmar Collateral Digital Nerves.—These nerves, of a digit, appear posteriorly with, and distribute to the same areas as, the last-described arteries. Dissection.—Clear tlie surfaces of the digital portions of the tendons of the extensor communis digitorum, the extensor minimi digiti, and the extensor indicis muscles. Follow to their distal attachments the lumbricales, the pal- mar interosseous, and the dorsal interosseous muscles. Demonstrate the com- pound digital extensor aponeuroses of the digits, second to fifth, inclusive. 38. Extensor Communis Digitorum Muscle, Plates 163 and 170.—The terminal tendons of this muscle pass to the dorsal surfaces of the second, third, fourth, and fifth digits. A given tendon is projected upon the dorsal surface of a metacarpo- phalangeal articulation, where it has lateral expansions upon the sides of the joint, which blend with the palmar ligament of the joint ; it advances upon the phalanx of the digit, where it contributes to the compound digital extensor aponeurosis. 39. Extensor Indicis Muscle, Plates 165, 167, and Fig. 2, Plate 170.—The tendon of this muscle is projected to the dorsal surface of the second or index digit, where it contributes to its compound digital extensor aponeurosis. 40. Extensor Minimi Digiti Muscle, Plate 165.—The ten- don of this muscle and the accessory terminal tendon of the extensor communis digitorum muscle are projected to the dor- sal surface of the fifth or minim digit, where they contribute to the compound digital extensor aponeurosis of the digit. 41. Eumbricales Muscles, Figs. 1, 2, and 3, Plate 170.— The anterior or palmar portions of these four muscles have been described (pages 221, 222, 223, and 230) and illustrated (Plates 127, 129, 131, 132, and 133). Their distal ends wind over the outer sides of the metacarpophalangeal articulations and bases of the phalanges of the digits, second to fifth, in- clusive, to where they end in a fibrous expansion (Fig. 3, Plate 170), which contributes to the compound digital extensor aponeurosis of the digits, second to fifth, inclusive. 42. Palmar Interosseous Muscles, Figs. 1 and 4, Plate 170. —The anterior or palmar surfaces of these three muscles have been described (page 234) and illustrated (Plates 122, 132, and

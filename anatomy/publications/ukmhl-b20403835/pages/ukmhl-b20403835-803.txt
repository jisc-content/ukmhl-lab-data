PHARYNX. 381 of the pharynx. Change the position of the half head in the pharyngeal frame so as to expose the right postero-lateral face of the pharynx, etc. (Plate 201). Dissect the internal pterygoid muscle from its ptery go id-plate attachment; and section the inferior dental nerve as in Plate 201. Clear (Plate 201) the right external surfaces of the following parts: the inferior, middle, and su- perior constrictor muscles ; the stylo-pharyngeus and stylo-glossus muscles. Display the pterygo-maxillary ligament, and the relations to it of the superior constrictor and buccinator muscles. 1. Inferior Constrictor Muscle, Plates 190, 196, 200, and 201.—This muscle is attached to the median-line raphe at the posterior of the pharynx, where it meets its fellow of the oppo- site side (Plates 200 and 201). Its fibres wind externally, an- teriorly, and inferiorly, to enclose the postero-lateral wall of the pharyngeal cavity, exteriorly to its fibrous coat and the in- ferior portion of the middle constrictor muscle. It is attached, anteriorly, to the exterior of the lateral wall of the larynx— thyroid and cricoid cartilages (Plates 190, 196, and 201). 2. Middle Constrictor Muscle: Plates 190, 196, 200, 201, and 204 ; Fig. 1, Plate 205.—This muscle attaches itself, posteriorly, to the median-line raphe of the pharyngeal wall, meeting the muscle of the opposite side (Plates 200 and 201). Its inferior portion lies interiorly to the inferior constrictor muscle, its superior portion exteriorly to the inferior part of the superior constrictor muscle. Its fibres pass, in the postero-lateral walls of the pharynx, to their anterior attachment, to the interior of the superior border of the great cornu of the hyoid bone (Plates 190, 196, 201, and 204; Fig. 1, Plate 205). 3. Superior Constrictor Muscle: Fig. 2, Plate 188 ; Plates 190, 196, 200, 201, 203, and 204; and Fig. 1, Plate 205.—This muscle is located in the postero-lateral walls of the superior half of the pharynx. It lies exteriorly to the fibrous coat of the pharynx ; its inferior half interiorly to the superior part of the middle constrictor muscle (Plate 200). Its attachment posteriorly is to the superior half of the common median-line raphe of the constrictor muscles (Plate 200). Anteriorly, its inferior fibres blend into the posterior of the lateral border of the tongue (Plates 196, 201, and 204 ; Fig. 1, Plate 205) ; its superior fibres pass to the inferior maxillary bone (Plate 190), the pterygo-maxillary ligament (Plates 201 and 203), and the

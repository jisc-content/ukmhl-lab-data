HEAD AND NECK. 432 strice acusticce, which pass externally, out of the ventricle, and join the auditory nerve, right and left, respectively. The pons Varolii portion of the floor of the fourth ventri- cle (Fig. 3, Plate 222) presents the superior continuance of the median sulcus. At its superior end is the posterior opening of the aqueduct of Sylvius (a bristle emerges from it); the ante- rior opening of this aqueduct was described (page 423) and illustrated (Fig. 1, Plate 218 ; the aqueduct or canal runs be- tween these two openings, inferiorly to the corpora quadri- gemina, from the third (page 423; Fig. 1, Plate 219) to the fourth ventricle of the brain. At the external ends of the transverse line of junction of the two portions of the fourth ventricle are the lateral recesses of the cavity. Dissection.—Section, as in Fig. 3, Plate 219, longitudinally, at the left of the median line, through the medulla oblongata, pons Varolii, corpora quad- rigemina, crus cerebri, and thalamus opticus. 55. Structural Appearances of the Medulla Oblongata, Pons Varolii, Corpora Quadrigemina, Crus Cerebri, and Thalamus Opticus, Fig. 3, Plate 219.—This section of these parts is made to afford an approximate appreciation of the dis- tribution of the grey and white neural tissues through them.

Fibrous Coat of the Pharynx: Fig. 2, Plate 188 ; Plates 199, 200, and 201.—This coat of the pharynx, common to both halves, is located interiorly to its muscular coat (the right and left superior, middle, and inferior constrictor, and stylo-pharyn- gens muscles), and exteriorly to its submucous and mucous coats, and the right and left palato-pharyngeus muscles. It con- tributes to the postero-lateral walls of the cavity, and is attach- ed, superiorly, to the occipital bone (at the median line of the inferior surface of its basilar process, Plate 199), the sphenoid bone (its body), and the temporal bone (its petrous portion). It forms, posteriorly, the median-line, fibrous, raphe (Plate 200), from which the right and left constrictor muscles (inferior, middle, and superior) are projected, externally and anteriorly. It also appears, free of muscle investment, superiorly, between the superior borders of the right and left superior constrictor muscles and the inferior surface of the base of the cranium (Plate 200). 5. Stylo-pharyngeus muscle, Plates 190, 196, 200, 201, 203, and 204.—This muscle is attached: superiorly, to the poste- rior surface of the styloid process of the petrous portion of the temporal bone (Plate 190) ; inferiorly, to the fibrous coat of the pharynx (Plate 200) and the external face of the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage of the larynx (Plates 190 and 200). In its inferior course the muscle enters at first, between the planes of the superior and middle constrictor muscles ; then it runs between the inferior constrictor muscle, exteriorly, and the fibrous coat of the pharynx, interiorly. 6. Pterygo-maxillary Ligament, Plates 201 and 203.—This is a stretch of fibrous tisues from the hamular process of the sphenoid bone to the internal surface of the lateral portion of the body of the inferior maxillary bone (at the attachment of the superior constrictor muscle, Plate 190). It forms a raphe for the common attachment of the posterior ends of the mid-fibres of the buccinator muscle and the anterior ends of the su- perior fibres of the superior constrictor muscle. This relation of the buccinator and superior constrictor muscles, right and

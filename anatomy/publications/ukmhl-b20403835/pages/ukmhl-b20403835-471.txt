Expose the palmaris brevis mus- cle, and find the palmar cutaneous branches of the median, the ulnar, and the musculo-cutaneous nerves. 7. Palmaris Brevis Muscle.-This flat, subcutaneous mus- ate is located at the proximal portion of the minim eminence oi the palm. It is attached to the inner border of the palmar fossa portion of the palmar fascia, and to the skin alone- the minim side of the hand. Its degree of development varies, from a few stray fibres to a well-defined plane of muscle. 8. Palmar Cutaneous Branch of the median Serve;—This branch of the median nerve perforates the fascia at the wrist and distributes in the subcutaneous plane of the proximal por- tion of the palmar fossa. 9 Palmar Cutaneous Branch of the Ulnar Nerve—This branch of the_ ulnar nerve distributes in the subcutaneous plane of the minim eminence of the palm. 10.

The aponeurosis of the third digit results from the fusion of : a terminal tendon of the extensor communis digitorum muscle ; the tendon of the dorsal portion of the second dorsal interosseous muscle, and that of the second lum- bricalis muscle, at the outer side ; the tendon of the dorsal portion of the dorsal interosseous muscleâ€”at the inner side. That of the fourth digit is contributed to (Fig. 1, Plate 170) by: a terminal tendon of the extensor communis digitorum muscle; the tendon of the second palmar interosseous mus- cle, and that of the third lumbricalis muscle, at the outer side ; the tendon of the dorsal portion of the fourth dorsal interosseous muscle, at the inner side. The aponeurosis of the fifth digit is formed by: the tendon of the extensor minimi digiti muscle with the accessory tendon of the extensor communis digitorum muscle ; the tendon of the third palmar interosseous muscle, and that of the fourth lumbricalis mus- cle, at the outer side. The aponeurosis of a digit is broadest in its phalanx portion, and opposite the distal portion of that bone it trifurcates ; the middle slip of the trifurcation is at- tached to the base of the phalangine; the lateral slips are projected upon the phalangine of the digit, where they blend into one slip, which is continued to its attachment to the base of the phalangette of the digit. As the aponeuroses cross the digital joints they lie upon the posterior ligaments of the latter.

180 LOWER EXTREMITY. whose plantar surface is covered by the sheath o£ the flexor tendons of the digit. IhssECTioN.-Clear the surfaces of the metatarsophalangeal articulations. Kxpose the four distal intermetatarsal interosseous ligaments. 2. Metatarsophalangeal Artlenlatlons.-These joints, five in number, have the same construction as the digital, the planar ligaments (Figs. 2 and 3, Plate 104) differ from those of the digits in that the plates of fibro-cartxlage are much thicker. The two sesamoid bones opposite the joint of the first digit take the- place of the fibro-cartilage plates of the joints of the other digits (page 149 ; Fig. 1, Plate 82). 3 Distal intermetatarsal Ugaments, Figs. 1 and 2, Plate 104-These four interosseous ligaments bridge between the Plantar halves, of the opposed surfaces, of the distal ends of the metatarsal bones. Dissectxon -Expose the dorsal ligaments: intermetatarsal; cuneo-meta- tarsa^ubo-nretataL; intercuneiform; cuneo-cuhoid; scapho-eunerform; and scapho-cuboid. 4. Dorsal Intermetatarsal Ligaments, Plates 101 and 103.- These ligaments, three in number, pass between the dorsal sui- Ices of the proximal ends of the second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal bones. 5. Dorsal Cnneo-Metatarsal Ligaments, Plates 101^ and 103 • Fig 1, Plate 102.-These ligaments pass from the dorsal urfkces°of 'the first, second, third, and fourth metatarsal bone^ to the dorsal surfaces of the three cuneiform bones : from the first and second to the internal cunetform ; from the second to fte middle cuneiform; from the second, third, and fourth to the External cuneiform. At the inner side of the^rUcuhttim of the first metatarsal with the internal cuneiform thdorsal cuneo-metatarsal ligament passes to the plantar plane ot the joint, to become continuous with its plantar ligament, 6. Dorsal Cnbo-Metatarsal Ligaments, Plates 101 and 103 -These ligaments bridge from the bases of the fourth ana fifth metatarsal bones to the cuboid bone.

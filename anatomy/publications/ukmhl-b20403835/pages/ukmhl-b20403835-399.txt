FOURTEENTH DISSECTION. ARTICULATIONS OF ANKLE, FOOT, LEG, KNEE, AND HIP. Dissection.—At this stage of the dissection of the lower extremity the vertebral column should be disarticulated, between the fourth and fifth lum- bar vertebrae, so as to allow the limbs to be turned, as the dissection of their articulations may require. (The dissectors of the back will by this time have completed their work.) AETICULATION OF THE ANKLE. Dissection.—Eaise the knee by blocks so as to flex it over them, and allow the foot to rest on the table. Terms of Relation.—The terms distal (from the trunk), proximal (toward the trunk), anterior surface, posterior sur- face, inner side, and outer side will be used. Bones of the Ankle-Joint, Plates 68 and 83.—The bones directly concerned in the construction of this joint are: the astragalus at its distal side ; the articulated tibia and fibula (by the inferior (distal) tibio-fibular articulation) at its proxi- mal side. The calcaneum contributes to this joint, in affording partial attachments to its lateral ligaments. Dissection.—Clear the surfaces of the external lateral, the internal lateral, and the anterior ligaments. 1. External Lateral Ligament, Plates 101 and 103.—This ligament has its proximal attachment to the distal end of the hbula (external malleolus); it spreads, by three slips, to its ; distal attachments: an anterior, to the outer side of the neck ot the astragalus ; a middle, to the outer surface of the cal- caneum ; a posterior, to the outer side of the body of the astragalus. 2. Internal Lateral Ligament, Plates 102 and 103.—This ligament has its proximal attachment to the distal end of the 13

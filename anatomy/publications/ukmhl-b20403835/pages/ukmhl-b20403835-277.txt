TENTH DISSECTION. ANTERIOR OF LEG AND DORSUM OF FOOT. Dissection.—For this dissection the two limbs should be supported at the ankles on blocks; tie the great toes together, so as to expose the outer antero- lateral area of the leg and foot. Terms of Relation.—The terms applicable to both regions are : the general, inferior ; the special, proximal and distal (toward and from the trunk). Those for the leg are: anterior, posterior, outer, and inner surfaces; outer antero-lateral and inner antero- lateral areas (including both anterior and outer or inner surfaces, respectively). Those to the foot are: dorsum on dorsal surface; plantar surf ace ; inner or pollex border or side; outer or minim border or side. Those to the toes are : dorsal, plantar, and lateral digital surfaces. The regions of the foot will be spoken of as tar- sal, metatarsal, and digital. Bones and Bone Areas, Plates 67 and 68.— The outer and inner surfaces of the tibia and fibula of the leg ; the dorsal surfaces of the bones of the tarsal region of the foot—calcaneum, as- tragalus, scaphoid, cuneiform (internal, middle, and external), and cuboid ; the dorsal surfaces of the bones of the metatarsal region—the five metatarsals ; and the dorsal surfaces of the four- teen bones of the digits * form the osseous frame- work of the dissection. All of these bones, ex- cept the astragalus, the scaphoid, the cuboid, and the three * The bones of the digits will be called by the special French names given to them by Chaussier, anglicized as follows: phalanx (s.), phalanges (pi.), to the five bones of the proximal row; phalangine (s.), phalangines (pi.), to the four of the mid- die row; phalangette (s.), phalangette* (pi.), to the five of the distal row.

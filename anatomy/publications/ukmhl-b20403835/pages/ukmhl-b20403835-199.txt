SIXTH DISSECTION. ABDOMINAL VISCERA OUT OF THE BODY. Dissection.—Commence the dissection of the abdominal viscera with the jejunal and ileal portions of the small intestine. Trim the shreds of the mesen- tery from the intestine ; stretch out the latter and slit it open from the jejunal end, along its line of mesentery attachment. 1. Jejunum and Ileum of the Small Intestine, Figs. 1 and 2, Plate 47.—The exterior of the small intestine is invested by peritoneum, except at the line where the two layers of the mes- entery meet; at this line of its circumference its arteries and nerves distribute to it, and its veins and lymphatic vessels leave it. The mucous membrane, that lines this intestine, presents the valvuisB conniventes (Fig. 1, Plate 47); these are formed by the membrane's reduplications, which have a velvety ap- pearance, due to the villi; in the ileal portion the valvule con- niventes diminish in depth and number, and are absent in its inferior third. In the ileum are found, here and there, what are known as Peyer's patches (Fig. 2, Plate 47); these are slightly depressed areas of the mucous membrane with ele- vated borders, the interiors being somewhat pitted; they are most numerous toward the inferior end of the ileum. Dissection.—Cut off from four to six inches of the small intestine and pin it out taut upon a dissecting board (Fig. 1, Plate 47). Dissect the layers of the intestinal wall; the success of this* demonstration will depend upon the fresh- ness of the material. 2. Coats of the Small Intestine, Fig. 1, Plate 47.—This in- testine will be found to present a readily demonstrable mucous membrane, a submucous plane not easily determined, a recog- nizable muscular coat and a well-defined serous coat. Such is the general structure of the subdiaphragmatic portions of

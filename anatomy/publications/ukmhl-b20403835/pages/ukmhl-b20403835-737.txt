DEEP REGION OF THE FACE. 351 root and the motor root of the trifacial nerve, in the deep region of the face. Find (Fig 1 Plate 188) the nerve to the internal pterygoid muscle from the trifacial nerve ; also, the chorda tympani nerve (Fig. 1, Plate 188) at its junction with the gustatory nerve ; follow the latter, superiorly and externally, to the Glasserian fissure of the glenoid cavity of the inferior maxillary bone. Expose the middle and small meningeal arteries (Fig. 1, Plate 188) from their origins to their entrances into the cranium. 7. Inferior Maxillary Division of the Sensory Root, and the Motor Root, of the Trifacial Serve, Plate 188 —The intra- cranial portions of this division of the sensory root, and the motor root, of this cranial nerve were before described (page 345) and illustrated (Plates 180, 185, and 186). They emerge from the cranium into the deep region of the face, by the fora- men ovale in the great wing of the sphenoid bone ; they lie externally to the superior portion of the tensor palati muscle. 8. Buccal, Temporal, Masseteric, External Pterygoid and Internal Pterygoid Nerves, Plates 184, 187, and Fig. 1, Plate 188.—These are all motor nerves (except the buccal), and are given off from the motor portion of the trifacial nerve, to supply the muscles their names imply. The buccal nerve has been described (page 349) and illustrated (Plate 187). 9. Auriculotemporal Nerve, Plates 182 and 183 ; Fig. 2, Plate 184; Plate 187; Fig. 1, Plate 188.—This nerve may be traced from its external portion anteriorly to the auricle (Fig. 2, Plate 184), to the point where it winds posteriorly to the" glenoid cavity of the temporal bone, into the deep region of the face. It passes internally, externally to the internal lateral ligament of the temporo-maxillary articulation, to the point where it divides to include the middle meningeal artery ; it then unites again, forming a single trunk, which may be traced to the inferior maxillary division of the sensory root of the trifacial nerve. 10. Inferior Dental Nerve, Plates 187 and 188.—This nerve is a branck of the inferior maxillary division of the sensory root of the trifacial nerve, after the same has entered the deep region of the face (page 345 ; Plate 188). It is projected, inferiorly, externally to the tensor palati and internal ptery- goid muscles, to the internal surface of the ramus of the inferior maxillary bone, where it enters, the inferior dental

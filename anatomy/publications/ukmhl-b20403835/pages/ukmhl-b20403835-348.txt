16g LOWER EXTREMITY. teriorly, and the tibialis posticus muscle, anteriorly. It affords branches to contiguous muscles, and terminates, at the distal limit of the tibio-fibular interosseous space, by bifurcating into the anterior and the posterior peroneal arteries. 59 Anterior Peroneal Artery, Plate 90. - This artery (vena3 comites) was seen at the anterior surface of the leg (page 132), and illustrated (Fig. 1, Plate 73 and Plate 74). It passes to the anterior surface of the leg, through a deficiency at the distal end of the tibio-fibular interosseous ligament. 6© Posterior Peroneal Artery. —This artery (venfe co- mites) is a small vessel upon the posterior surface of the ankle- joint, between the tendo Achillis and the tendons of the peronei muscles. Dissection—Clear the posterior surface of the tibialis posticus muscle and follow its tendon into the plantar region of the foot. 61 Tibialis Postiens Musele, Plates 75, 79 to 82 inclusive, 83, and 87 to 90, inclusive—This muscle occupies the posterior surface of the tibio-fibular interosseous ligament (Plate 90); t is attached to the proximal half of the ligament and the adj oining surfaces of the tibia and fibula (Plate 83 . Its tendon lies upon the posterior surface of the internal malleolus (Plates 85 87 88 and 89), distal to which it winds to reach the pollex border of the tarsal region of the foot (Plate 89). It is at- tached, primarily, to the tubercle of the scaphoid bone (Plates 75, 79 to 82, inclusive, and 89) ; secondarily, by outer and distal expansions, which are described at pages 182 and 183, and illustrated Plate 105, and Pig. 1, Plate 106. _

TWENTY-SEVENTH DISSECTION. ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN; EXTERIOR OF THE CERE- BRUM; PARTS OF THE BRAIN. Dissection.—The brain, as removed from the cranium (page 324), may now be taken out of the solution of chloride of zinc, in which it has been kept. Terms of Relation.—The general terms of relation (page 2), and the special terms vertex, base, lateral area—applied to the brain in general—inter'lor and exterior—applied to the ven- tricular cavities—will be used in describing the arteries of the brain, the exterior of the cerebrum, and the parts of the brain. Membranes of the Brain, Plates 179 and 180.—The three investing membranes—dura mater, arachnoid, andpia mater —of the brain are described at pages 322, 328, and 324 ; also the subdural and subarachnoidean spaces at page 323. Venous Sinuses of the Cranium.—These intracranial venous canals are described at pages 323 and 326. AKTEKIES OF THE BKAIN. Dissection.—Place the brain upon a dissecting board, with its base upper- most (Plate 211). It is to be remembered, that the brain is turned over, and that its inferior surface looks superiorly instead of inferiorly. Trace the arteries of the posterior half of the base, viz. : the vertebral, the basilar, and the posterior cerebral, with their branches. 1. Vertebral Arteries and their Branches, Plate 211.— The entrances of these arteries into the cranium by the fora- men magnum were before described (page 325) and illustrated (Plate 180). Their intracranial portions have an antero-superior course upon the anteroinferior surface of the medulla oblon- gata ; at the superior limit of the latter they converge to form the basilar artery. The branches of this portion of a verte-

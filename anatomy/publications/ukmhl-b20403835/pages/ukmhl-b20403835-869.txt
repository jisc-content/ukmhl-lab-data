423 PARTS OF THE BRAIN". the lateral ventricles curve inferiorly to the venae Galeni, to where they meet at the median line, anteriorly ; along the me- dian line, and between the verise Galeni, they are continued, an- tero-posteriorly, as the choroid plexus of the third ventricle. Posteriorly, it broadens to surround the pineal body. 34. Pineal Body and its Crura, Fig. 1, Plate 218 ; Figs. 2 and 3, Plate 222.—This (misnamed a gland) is a small, reddish, cone-shaped body, which is lodged between the velum interpo- situm, superiorly, and the nates of the corpora quadrigemina (Fig. 2 , Plate 222), inferiorly. It projects a right and a left cms, anteriorly, along the superior-internal borders of the thalami optici; they are continued to the anterior pillars of the fornix. 35. Thalamus Opticus, Plates 216, 217, and 218.—This body—one of the two posterior, basal ganglia of the cerebrum —was referred to at pages 419 and 421. It is oval in shape and located as follows : internally, and partly inferiorly, to a taenia semicircularis, and a corpus striatum (its posterior por- tion) ; externally to, and forming the lateral wall of, the third ventricle of the brain (Fig. 1, Plate 218); inferiorly to the half of the velum interpositum and a choroid plexus—except where the anterior tubercle of a thalamus opticus appears at the floor of the cavity of a lateral ventricle (Plates 216 and 217). Its superior surface presents an anterior and a posterior tubercle (Fig. 1, Plate 218). 36. Third Ventricle of the Brain, Fig. 1, Plate 218.—This intracerebral cavity is bounded : superiorly, by the velum in- terpositum (Fig. 2, Plate 217); laterally, by the right and left thalamus opticus, respectively; anteriorly, by the anterior pillars of: the fornix; posteriorly, by the corpora quadri- gemina ; inferiorly by the lamina cinerea, and the parts con- tained in the interpeduncular space (page 415 ; Plate 214)—the tuber cinereum, the corpora mam miliaria, and the posterior perforated space. The ventricular cavity is crossed by three transverse commissures : an anterior commissure, of white neural tissue, lies anteriorly to the anterior pillars of the fornix (Fig. 2, Plate 217; Fig. 1, Plate 218), and unites the anterior portions of the thalami optici; a posterior commissure (Fig. 1, Plate 218 ; Fig. 3, Plate 222), of white neural tissue, located

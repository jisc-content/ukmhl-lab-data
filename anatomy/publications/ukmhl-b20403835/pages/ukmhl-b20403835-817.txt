LARYNX. 395 5. Thyroid Cartilage: Plates 190, 195, 196, 197, 203, and 204 ; Fig. 1, Plate 207 ; Fig. 2, Plate 208.—This movable carti- lage is shaped like a horizontal letter V—the apex anteriorly, the open base posteriorly. Its halves are called alee (Fig. 1, Plate 207) : their anterior meeting is the angle of the cartilage ; from their posterior borders are projected the, right and left, inferior and the superior cornua. 6. Crico-tUyroicl Muscle, Plates 190, 195, 196, 197, and 207. —This, one of a pair of intrinsic muscles of the larynx, is at- tached : inferiorly and anteriorly, to the exterior of the ring- portion of the cricoid cartilage ; superiorly and posteriorly, to the exterior of the posterior part of the inferior border of the ala of the thyroid cartilage. 7. Crico-tliyroid Articulation, Plate 207.—-The elements of this articulation are : a facet at the internal surface of the free end of an inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage; a facet on the lateral surface of the signet-portion of the cricoid cartilage (Fig. 2, Plate 207); and a capsular ligament (Fig. 1, Plate 207) lined by synovial membrane. 8. Cricothyroid Membrane, Plates 190, 197, and 207.— This is a sheet of fibrous tissue, that bridges between the supe- rior border of the ring-portion of the cricoid cartilage and the inferior border of the thyroid cartilage. Interiorly, it is lined by mucous membrane (Fig. 1, Plate 208) ; exteriorly, are the, right and left, crico-thyroid and lateral crico-arytenoid muscles. 9. Posterior Crico-arytenoid Muscle, Fig. 1, Plate 207.— This, one of a pair of intrinsic muscles of the larynx, is at- tached : inferiorly and internally, to the exterior of the signet- portion of the cricoid cartilage ; superiorly and externally, to the postero-external angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage (Fig. 2, Plate 207). 10. Arytenoid Muscle.—This single, median-line, intrinsic muscle of the larynx crosses, transversely, between its attach- ments to the posterior surfaces of the, right and left, arytenoid cartilages. Dissection.—Track the superior laryngeal nerve and internal laryngeal ar- tery into the submucous tissue between the thyro-hyoid membrane, exteriorly,

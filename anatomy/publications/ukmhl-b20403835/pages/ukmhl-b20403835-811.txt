TONGUE AND CONTIGUOUS PARTS. 389 lary bone, are swung by three pairs of extrinsic muscles—the stylo-glossus, palato-glossus, and superior constrictor. Its dorsum arches, postero-anteriorly, presenting a pharyngeal (Plates 202 and 203 ; Fig. 1, Plate 206) and a buccal face (Plate 204). Its apex (Plate 204) or anterior free end is com- pletely invested by mucous membrane. Dissection.—Clear (Plate 204) the external surfaces of the right stylo- glossus, hyo glossus, and genio-hyoid muscles; and portions of the genio-hyo- glossus muscle. Cut away (Plate 204) a piece of the posterior of the hyo- glossus muscle, in order to bring into view a part of the dorsal artery of the tongue, and the anterior direction of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Feel the course of the lingual artery internally to the hyo-glossus muscle. 5. Stylo-glossus Muscle, Plates 190. 194, 196, 200, 201, 203, and 204.—This extrinsic muscle of the tongue is attached, posteriorly, to the styloid process of the petrous portion of the temporal bone (Plates 190, 200, 201, 203, and 204); thence, it has an inferior and anterior course, externally to the supe- rior constrictor muscle (Plates 196, 200, 201, 203, and 204); at the tongue its fibres blend into the lateral border of that organ (Plate 204 ; Fig. 1, Plate 205). 6. Hyo-glossus Muscle: Plates 190, 192, 196, 201, 203, and 204 ; Fig. 1, Plate 205.—This extrinsic muscle of the tongue is attached, inferiorly, to the exterior of the superior border of the great cornu of the hyoid bone (Plate 190) ; superiorly, its fibres merge into the lateral border of the tongue (Plate 204; Fig. 1, Plate 205). 7. Gcnio-hyoid Muscle, Plates 190, 195, 196, 197, and 204.— This muscle is described at page 365, with the parts exposed at the left side of the neck (Plates 195, 196, and 197). The genio- hyoid and mylo-hyoid muscles, right and left, form the mus- cular floor of the buccal cavity, and consequently belong to the region of the head, and not to the neck region. For the same reason the hyoid bone, as supporting the tongue and buccal floor, is a bone of the head. Dissection.—Take the half head from the pharyngeal frame. Section (Plate 204) the pillars and tonsil of the soft palate, right and left, and the parts contiguous to them, thus dividing the anterior half of the head and ap- pended organs into two portions : the superior, made up of the upper jaw region of the face and the anterior of the cranium ; the inferior, consisting of

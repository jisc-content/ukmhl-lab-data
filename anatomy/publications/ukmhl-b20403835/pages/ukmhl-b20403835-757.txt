TWENTY-FIFTH DISSECTION. ANTEROLATERAL AREA OF THE NECK. Dissection.—With the subject placed as for dissection of the upper ex- tremities (page 193), rest the left lateral surface of the head upon a block, and steady the same in the position shown in Plate 191. Terms of Relation.—The general terms (page 2) are used ; and the special terras antero-lateral and lateral—to the neck— interior and exterior—to the mouth, thorax, and larynx. Bones ; Bone and Cartilage Areas for Musele Attachments, Plates 189 and 190.—The bones, forming the framework of this dissection, are: posteriorly, the seven cervical vertebras and the two superior dorsal vertebras (their anterior surfaces) ; in- feriority, the sternum (its superior end), the clavicle (its supe- rior border), the two superior ribs (their exterior surfaces); su- periorly, the occipital (its inferior surface), the hyoid and in- ferior maxilla^ bones (their inferior borders). All of these bones, with the thyroid cartilage of the larynx, afford attach- ments to muscles in this dissection. Dissection.—Make the skin incisions 3, 4, 4, and 5, of Figure 14 (page 318), and reflect a flap as commenced. 1. Subcutaneous Tissue, Plate 191.—This presents as a thin layer anteriorly to the platysma myoides muscle, and a thick one externally and internally therefrom. Dissection.—Dissect the subcutaneous tissue from the platysma myoides muscle. 2. Platysma myoides Musele.—The cervical portion of this oblong muscle occupies the antero-lateral area of the neck. It is attached, inferiorly, to the fascia of the thorax, parallel with, and inferiorly to, the clavicle. Its internal fibres meet those of

TRUNK. 286 processes are held opposed by capsular ligaments ; a ligamen- tum subflavum bridges between the laminae of the fifth lumbar vertebra and the superior border of the posterior wall of the sacral canal. 74. Sacrococcygeal Articulation.—This joint is formed by: the coccyx and sacrum; an intervertebral disc of fibro- cartilage ; an anterior saero-coccygeal ligament (page 84) ; a posterior sacro-coccygeal ligament from the posterior surface of the coccyx to the margin of the inferior orifice of the sacral canal; inter articular ligaments between the cornua of the coccyx and sacrum ; lateral ligaments bridge between the con- tiguous borders of the two bones. 75. Sacro-iliac Articulation, Plate 42 ; Fig. 1, Plate 45 ; Plate 147.—This articulation includes the following elements: bones, direct ligaments, and indirect ligaments. The bones are : the ilium portion of the innominate bone ; the sacrum ; the fifth lumbar vertebra (transverse process) ; the ischium portion of the innominate bone ; and the coccyx. The direct ligaments are : the posterior sacro iliac (Plate 147), from the posterior surface of the internal portion of the ilium to the posterior surface of the sacrum ; the anterior sacro-iliac, before described (page 84) and illustrated (Plate 42 and Fig. 1, Plate 45). The indirect ligaments include : the ilio-lumbar (page 84; Plates 42 and 147) ; the great sacro-sciatic and the small sacro- sciatic (page 84 ; Plate 42 ; Fig. 1, Plate 45 ; and Plate 147).

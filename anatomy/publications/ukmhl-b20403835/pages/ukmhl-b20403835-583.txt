and the arteries ramifying in the subcutaneous tissue plane (Plate 148) ; then NINETEENTH DISSECTION. REGION" OF THE BACK; SPINAL CORD IN SITU; VERTEBRAL COLUMN AND ITS LIGAMENTS. Dissection.—Place the subject with the back uppermost; with a block 'under the thorax, and one under the pelvis. The head should hang to the table; while the upper extremities hang over the sides of the table. (The dis- sectors of the two upper-extremity and the head-and-neck sections should work together upon the first part of this dissection.) Terms of Relation.—The general terms (page 2), and the special terms exterior and interior (toward the skin and the cavities of the trunk, respectively) will be used, in describing this dissection. The regions of the back are the sacral, the lumbar, the dorsal, and the cervical. Bones and Bone Areas, Plate 147.—The bones are the posterior surfaces of the following : the twenty- four vertebrae, sacrum, and coccyx ; the occipital ; the twelve pairs of ribs; the scapulas ; the clavicles ; and the ossa innominata. They all present areas for the attachments of mus- cles. REGION OF THE BACK. Dissection.—Make the skin incisions 1, 2, 3, and 4, of Fig- ure 11; reflect skin flaps, on either side of the median line, as indicated. Trace the nerves clear the fascial plane free of subcutaneous tissue, leaving the arteries and nerves in situ. Figure 11.

206 UPPER EXTREMITY. 6?. Musculo-Spiral Nerve, Plates 119 and 120.-This nerve, near its origin, runs superiorly to, and parallel with, the cir- cumflex nerve ; it has a distal course into the arm, lying, con- secutively, upon the anterior surfaces of the subscapulars muscle, the humeral ends of the latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles, and the inner side of the long head of the tri- ceps muscle. It enters between the long and inner heads ot the triceps muscle, to be continued, through the middle third of the arm, in the spiral groove on the posterior surface ot the shaft of the humerus ; its latter portion is accompanied by the superior profunda artery. Its branches are: the third sub- scapular nerve and branches to the triceps muscle. 68. Third Subscapular Nerve.-This nerve, a branch of the musculo-spiral, has an inferior and external course to distrib- ute to the subscapularis and teres major muscles. 69 Nerves to the Triceps Muscle. â€”The musculo-spiral nerve*gives off a number of branches: the first distributes to the long head of the triceps ; the second divides and sup- plies the inner head of the same muscle ; the other branches enter, with the trunk of the nerve, between the long and inner heads of the muscle. 70. Posterior Circumflex Artery, Plate 120.-This artery (venae comites), branch from the posterior of the axillary artery, accompanies the circumflex nerve from the axilla (page 205). Dissection.-Replace the axillary and brachial arteries, the sectioned cords of the brachial plexus, and the branches of the plexus, before proceeding to the dissection of the anterior region of the forearm.

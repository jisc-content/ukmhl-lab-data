HEAD AND NECK. 326 36. Venous Sinuses of the Cranium.—Antero-posteriorly, the following sinuses, of a side, present: the coronary (one . half of it), at the superior surface of the body of the sphenoid bone, where it is located at one side of the pituitary body ; the cavernous, at the side of the body of the sphenoid bone—it re- ceives the ophthalmic vein from the orbit by the sphenoidal fissure ; the transverse (one-half of it), crossing one-half of the line of articulation of the basilar process of the occipital bone with the sphenoid bone ; the superior petrosal, in the attach- ment of the tentorium cerebelli along the superior border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, unites the cavernous with the lateral ; the inferior petrosal, lodged in the anterior portion of the teinporo-occipital articulation, unites the trans- verse with the lateral ; the lateral, posteriorly, along the line of occipital attachment of the tentorium cerebelli and, an- teriorly and inferiorly, at the interior of the mastoid portion of the temporal bone ; the occipital unites the torcular Herophili with the terminus of the lateral. The superior longitudinal, a part of which was recognized at its median-line position (page 319, Plate 179) in the convexity of the falx cerebri, empties, posteriorly, into the torcular Herophili; the inferior longitudi- nal has an antero-posterior course, and a median-line position in the edge of the concavity of the falx cerebri, ending at the anterior border of the tentorium cerebelli; the straight runs antero-posteriorly, in a median-line position, in the junction of the base of the falx cerebri with the superior surface of the tentorium cerebelli—it unites the posterior end of the inferior longitudinal sinus with the torcular Herophili. The torcular Herophili is the meeting of the superior longitudinal, the right and left lateral, the right and left occipital (and the straight) sinuses, at the median-line junction of the falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli, at the interior of the occipital bone. The internal jugular vein, attached to the circumference of the ex- terior of the posterior portion of the foramen lacerum posterius, presents its orifice to receive the blood collected by the intra- cranial sinuses of a side of the cranium. 37. Ophthalmic Artery.—This artery is given off from the intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery ; it runs in- feriorly to, and into the orbit by the optic foramen with, the optic nerve (page 325).

TRUNK. SEVENTEENTH DISSECTION. ANTERIOR OF THE THORACIC PARIETES ; THORACIC VISCERA IN SITU ; INTERIOR OF THE THORACIC CAVITY. Dissection.—The thorax and upper extremities should remain as placed for the fifteenth dissection (page 193). Dissect away the pectoralis major muscle from its sternal and costal cartilage attachments (Plate 120). Terms of Relation.—The general terms (page 2) ; and the special terms exterior and interior (relatively to those respec- tive surfaces of the thoracic parietes) are used in locating and describing the anatomical elements of this dissection. Bones and Cartilages; Muscle Areas of Bones and Carti- lages, Plates 113 and 135.—The sternum, the superior six pairs of costal cartilages, the antero-lateral portions of the superior nine pairs of ribs, and the dorsal vertebrae, form the skeleton of the included portion of the thoracic parietes. All the costal cartilages and all the bones—with the exception of the anterior surfaces of the bodies of the eight inferior dorsal vertebrae— j afford areas for the attachments of muscles. ANTEEIOE OF THE THOEACIO PAEIETES. Dissection. —Clear the anterior surface of the sterno-clavicular articulation j (Plate 113), and demonstrate its anterior ligaments. Open the anterior of the joint and expose its fibro-cartilage (Plate 136), and its posterior ligament. 1. Sterno-Clavicular Articulation, Plates 113 and 136.— This articulates the internal end of a clavicle with the facet j at an angle of the base of the sternum. Its anterior ligaments

Postero-inferior Opening into the Fourth Ventricle of the Brain, Fig. 1, Plate 220.—The postero-inferior portion of this ventricle is located between the postero-superior surface of the medulla oblongata and the inferior surface of the cere- bellum. The sides of its floor present the diverging r est iform bodies of the medulla oblongata or inferior peduncles of the cerebellum entering the latter part of the brain. 41. Cerebellum, Plate 211 ; Plates 213 to 218, inclusive; Plates 220 and 221 ; Fig. 2, Plate 222.—This portion of the brain is located inferiorly to the occipital lobes of the hemi- spheres of the cerebrum, and postero-superiorly to the medulla oblongata and pons Varolii. It is in continuity with the other three parts of the brain, as follows: with the medulla oblon- gata by the restiform bodies of the latter, which are its, right and left, inferior or medulla oblongata peduncles (Plate 220 ; Fig. 2, Plate 222); with the pons Varolii by the inferior, trans- verse, iibres of the same, which form its, right and left, middle or pons Varolii peduncles (Plate 214 ; Fig. 1, Plate 220 ; Fig. 2, Plate 222) ; with the cerebrum by the processi e cerebello ad testes, which are its, right and left, superior or cerebrum peduncles (Fig. 2, Plate 220 ; Fig. 2, Plate 222). It is divided into a right and a left hemisphere by a postero-inferior notch (Fig. 2, Plate 220 ; Fig. 1, Plate 221). Its median-line portion is commissural between the hemispheres, forming the inferior and the superior vermiform processes (Plate 220 ; Fig. 1, Plate 221). Its surface differs from that of the cerebrum, in that it presents laminse separated by linear furrows, instead of convo- lutions divided by sulci. Dissection.—Section the peduncles of the cerebellum, as follows : the right and left inferior peduncles, and the right and left middle peduncles (Fig. 1, Plate 220 ; Fig. 2, Plate 222) ; the right and left superior peduncles, as in Fig. 2, Plate 222. Place the cerebellum so as to present its anteroinferior sur- face (Fig. 2, Plate 220) ; cut away the right amygdala. 42. Antero inferior Surface of the Cerebellum, Plate 220. —Anteriorly, the cerebellum presents a broad notch (Fig. 2, Plate 220) for its adaptation to the postero-superior surfaces of the medulla oblongata and the processi e cerebello ad testes —this surface contributes to the roof of the fourth ventricle; it- is within this area that the right and left superior, middle, and inferior peduncles of the cerebellum enter its substance (Fig.

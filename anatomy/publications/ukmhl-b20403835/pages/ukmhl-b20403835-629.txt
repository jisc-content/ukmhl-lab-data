291 POSTERIOR OF SHOULDER AND ARM. 11. Teres Minor Muscle.—This muscle lias an inferior and internal attachment to the external and superior portions of the infraspinous fossa of the scapula. It lies in a plane pos- teriorly to the proximal end of the long head of the triceps muscle, and it crosses the posterior face of the capsular liga- ment of the shoulder-joint, to reach its superior attachment to the inferior facet of the outer tuberosity of the humerus (Fig. 2, Plate 158). Dissection. —Follow the long head of the triceps muscle to its proximal attachment (Plate 113), and display the outer head of the same muscle. Ex- pose the teres major muscle ; also the external and superior portion of the latissimus dorsi muscle. 12. Triceps Muscle, Plate 113 ; Fig. 1, Plate 158 ; Plates 160,161, and 162.—The long head of this muscle passes between the teres minor muscle, posteriorly, and the teres major mus- cle, anteriorly, to its proximal attachment to the superior por- tion of the external border of the scapula (Plate 113). The proximal attachment of the outer head extends from the spiral groove of, to the outer tuberosity of, the humerus. 13. Teres Major Muscle.—The inferior and internal attach- ment of this muscle is to the external portion of the inferior half of the infraspinous fossa of the scapula (Fig. 1, Plate 158); from this point the muscle has a superior, external, and slightly distal course (page 196 ; Plates 116 to 120, inclusive), ante- riorly to the long head of the triceps. Its superior and ex- ternal attachment is to the posterior lip of the bicipital groove of the humerus (Plate 113). 14. Latissimus Dorsi Muscle, Plates 113, 160, 161, and 162. —The postero-internal and inferior portions of this muscle were before described (page 267) and illustrated (Plates 147 and 149). Its external and superior end winds anteriorly to the teres major muscle in the posterior fold of the axilla (page 196 ; Plates 116 to 120, inclusive); its flat tendon, about half the breadth of the tendon of the teres major, enters the bicipital groove of the humerus, where it is attached, posteriorly to the tendon of the long head of the biceps muscle (Plate 113). Dissection.—Find the musculo-spiral nerve and its branches, .between the long and the outer heads of the triceps muscle, distal to the teres major mus- cle. Expose the superior profunda branch of the brachial artery. Put a loop

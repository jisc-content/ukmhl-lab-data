SOFT AND HARD PALATE. 385 i temporal bone (Plates 190 and 199); thence, it passes inferiorly and internally (Plates 196, 201, and 204), entering interiorly to the lateral wall of the pharynx, superiorly to the superior constrictor muscle of the same (Plates 201, 203, and 204). Its palatine end enters the postero-superior face of the body of the soft palate, blending with the palatine ends of the last-described muscle (Plate 203, right side), and continuing to meet its fel- low of the opposite side at the median-line raphe of the soft palate. 3. Azygos Uvulae Muscle, Plate 203, and Fig. 2, Plate 205. —This muscle is attached to the posterior, median-line angle of the horizontal plate of a palate bone ; it is projected parallel with the median line, posteriorly and inferiorly, between the superior-internal palatine fibres of the palato- pharyngeus muscle (page 384), superiorly, and the horizontal portion of the tensor palati muscle, inferiorly ; it forms, by its free end, one-half of the substance of the uvula. Dissection.—Cut away (Plate 203, left side) the superior portion of the fibrous coat and superior constrictor muscle of the pharynx, trimming away the fibrous coat of the same along the posterior border of the stylo-pharyngeus muscle. Dissect (Plate 203, left side) from the postero-superior surfaces of the horizontal portion of the tensor palati muscle, and the superior face of the anteroinferior mucous membrane layer of the soft palate, the palatine ends of the palato-pharyngeus and levator palari muscles. Cut away (Plate 203, left side) the levator palati muscle. Display (Plate 203, left side) : the tensor pa- lati muscle ; the hamular process of the sphenoid bone ; the distribution of the ascending palatine artery ; and more of the pharyngeal end of the Eustachian tube. 4. Tensor Palati Muscle, Plates 188, 190, 199, 200, 201, 203, and 204,—This muscle has a vertical and a horizontal portion : the vertical portion is attached, superiorly, to the navicular fossa at the external face of the superior end of the internal plate of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone (Plates 190 and 199); thence, it has an inferior course parallel with, exter- nally to, and extending posteriorly to, the internal plate of the pterygoid process (Plates 200, 203, and 204), to wind inferiorly to the hamular process of the internal pterygoid plate ; the horizontal portion has an internal course from the hamular process to the median line, spreading, antero-posteriorly, as it 25

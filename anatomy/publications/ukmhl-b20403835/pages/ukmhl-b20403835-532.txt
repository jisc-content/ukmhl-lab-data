238 TRUNK. are : the anterior sterno-clavicular, which passes across the joint from the edge of the internal end of a clavicle to the border of the facet, at an angle of the base, of the sternum ; the interclavicular ligament bridges the interclavicular notch at the base of the sternum, between the superior borders of the internal ends of the clavicles, right and left; the costo-clamc- ular ligament binds the inferior border of the internal end of a clavicle to the exterior surface of the first costal cartilage of its side. The opening of the joint brings into view the inter- articular fibro-cartilage (Plate 136); also, the posterior sterno- clavicular ligament, from the posterior border of the internal end of the clavicle to the posterior border of the clavicular facet of the sternum. Dissection.-Section carefully-with a knife-the six superior pairs of cos- tal cartilages near their external ends, as shown on the third costal cartilage m Plate 120 • cut through the muscles of the right and left sixth intercostal spaces, close along the inferior borders of the sixth pair of costal cartilages, as far as the sternum ; section the sternum, on the line of the inferior borders of the sixth pair of costal cartilages. In sectioning the cartilages, and cutcmg the intercostal muscles, be very careful not to cut into the interior serous membranes-pleura and pericardium-and viscera. When the six h pair o costal cartilages are freed, raise one side, with the fingers of one_ hand and turn off the sternal plate (sternum, costal cartilages, etc.), superiorly from the right and left pleum, the pericardium, and the contents of the anterior mediastinum, by cutting, with a knife or curved scissors in the other hand, the following parts: the right and left internal mammary arteries, a then inferior and superior ends, also their branches into the mediastinum ; the at- tachments of the sterno-hyoid, and thyroid muscles (right and left) at the interior of the superior end of the sternum; the attachments of the fascij slips (right and left) of the omo-hyoid muscles, to the cartilages of the finl ribs • also, the sternal attachments of the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscles ngh and left) at the exterior of the superior end of the sternum. Place the sterna plate with its exterior surface uppermost and clear : the exterior surfaces o the sternum and the costal cartilages; the anterior sterno chondral ligaments the perforating arteries; and the anterior intercostal aponeuroses. Dissecj away the anterior intercostal aponeuroses of the second and third -terchondr j spaces; expose the anterior surfaces of the internal intercostal muscle planej of those spaces; trace the anterior intercostal arteries of the spaces, and follow them to their origins from the internal mammary artery by cutting away por- tions of the internal intercostal muscles (Fig. 1, Plato 135) Dissect away aj anterior sterno-chondral ligament, and display a superior and an mferioi stern* chondral ligament. Turn the sternal plate with its interior surface clear the interior of the sternum, noting the attachments of the steiilo-hjoid and sternothyroid muscles (right and left), near its superior end. «>U* interior surface of the triangularis sterni muscles and the interior blanches

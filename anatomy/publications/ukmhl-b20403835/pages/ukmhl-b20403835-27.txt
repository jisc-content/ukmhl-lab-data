INTRODUCTION. 5 Third -.—Never let your knife cut when you do not know what it is about to divide. Review of a Dissection.—When finishing work replace parts, as nearly as possible, in their normal relations, so that on resuming work, they may be removed in their relative order ; this affords repeated reviews of a dissection. How to Keep a Dissection.—Ke-apply skin flaps ; lay on the part the refuse tissue from the dissection ; cover with a dampened piece of muslin ; and, outside of all, wrap a piece of dry muslin or oil-silk. SPECIAL KULES OF DISSECTION. Anatomical Elements.—By an anatomical element, borrow- ing the term from chemical nomenclature, is to be understood a structural part of the body, such as the skin, a muscle, etc. The anatomical elements entering into the construction of the regions of the body are: epidermis, skin, subcutaneous tis- sue, superficial fascia, intermuscular septa, muscles, bursa, synovial sheaths of tendons, deep fascia, arteries, veins, lymphatic vessels, lymphatic glands, nerves, viscera, ducts, mucous membrane, serous membrane, ligaments, fibro-car- tilages, cartilages, and bones. All these elements are not present in every region of the body, and some are only found in special regions. Epidermis.—The epidermis or cuticle claims the respect of the dissector as a useful portion of the skin to him : where the epidermis is removed, the evaporation, that takes place, causes the skin and subjacent tissues to become hard, dry, and matted together, so as to interfere materially with dissection. Skin.—The skin or derma varies very much as to thickness, in the different regions. In making skin incisions, care should be taken, that the skin alone is cut through, as subcutaneous vessels, nerves, and even the muscles maybe divided,and mar, in consequence, subsequent dissection. Dissection.—The position of the knife, in making an incision through the 1 or any other membrane, should be vertical to the surface (Fig. 1, Plate

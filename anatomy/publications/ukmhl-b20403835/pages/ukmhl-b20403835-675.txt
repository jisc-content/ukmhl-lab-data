TWENTY-SECOND DISSECTION. ARTICULATIONS OF THE HAND, ELBOW, FORE- ARM, AND SHOULDER. AKTICULATIONS OF THE HAND. Dissection.—Dissect away the compound digital extensor aponeuroses from the digital region (Fig. 1, Plate 170) ; also the muscles from the meta- carpal region (Plates 133 and 169). Terms of Relation.—The following special terms are used in describing the articulations of the hand, viz. : 'proximal and distal; palmar and dorsal; inner and outer. The regions of the hand are : the digital,ihe metacarpal and the carpal. Bones of the Hand, Plates 122 and 163.—Twenty-seven bones form the framework of the hand : in the digital region are the five phalangites, the four pTialangines, and the five phalanges (page 123) ; in the metacarpal region are the five metacarpals; in the carpal region—from the outer to the inner side—the trapezium, the trapezoid, the os magnum, and the unciform construct the distal row, while—in the same direction —the scaphoid, the semilunar, the cuneiform, and the pisi- form make up the distal row. All of these bones afford attach- ments to ligaments. Dissection.—Expose the ligaments of the palmar, the inner, the outer, and the dorsal surfaces of the digital articulations. Open one or more of the digi- tal-joints so as to demonstrate the several ligaments (Fig. 2, Plate 173). 1. Articulations of the Digits, Plates 171, 172, and Fig. 2, Plate 173.—The fourteen bones of the digits, form nine articu- lations. Each articulation has four ligaments: two lateral, a palmar, and a dorsal. The lateral ligaments pass between the contiguous ends of the digital bones, in the dorsal halves of

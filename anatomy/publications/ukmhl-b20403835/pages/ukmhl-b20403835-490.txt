UPPER EXTREMITY. 228 81. Muscle Branches of the Deep Palmar Nerve, Plate 131.—From its inner side the deep palmar nerve gives off two branches : the first distributes to the flexor brevis minimi digiti and the abductor minimi digiti muscles ; the second, to the opponens minimi digiti muscle. 82. Opponens Minimi Digiti Muscle, Plates 122, 131, 132, and 133.—This muscle, the deepest of the muscles of the minim eminence, has its proximal attachment to the process of the unciform bone ; its distal to the inner portion of the palmar surface of the fifth metacarpal bone. To the inner side of its proximal end the deep palmar artery and nerve pass to their deep plane of distribution in the palm. Dissection.—Follow the ulnar artery through the forearm (Plate 130) to its bifurcation at the carpus (Plate 131). Trace the ulnar nerve, through the forearm, from its proximal entrance into the region, to its bifurcation into the superficial and deep palmar nerves. Find its branches to the flexor profundus digitorum and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles, also its dorsal and its palmar cuta- neous branches. Clear the surfaces of the forearm portions of the flexor carpi ulnaris, the flexor profundus digitorum, and the flexor longus pollicis muscles , (Plates 129 and 130). Follow the anterior interosseous nerve and its branches (Plate 130). 83. Ulnar Artery, Plates 128,130,131,132, and Fig. 2, Plate 134.—This artery (venae comites) has a distal course, from | where it passes to the posterior surface of the flexor sublimis ' digitorum muscle (page 226) ; it lies upon the anterior surface of the flexor profundus digitorum muscle, and along the outer side of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle ; it continues to where it divides into the (superficial palmar) palmar arch and the deep palmar artery (page 218). It supplies branches to contig- uous muscles, and near its bifurcation sends off the anterior ulnar carpal branch (Fig. 2, Plate 134). 84. Ulnar Nerve, Plates 125, 127, 128, 130, 131, 132, 133; Figs. 1 and 2, Plate 134.—This nerve enters the forearm region, from the groove on the posterior surface of the inner condyle of the humerus, passing to the plane between the flexor subli- mis and profundus digitorum muscles ; at its proximal end il supplies the flexor profundus digitorum muscle from its outer side, and the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle from its inner side. It has a distal course upon the anterior surface of the flexor

EIGHTEENTH DISSECTION, VISCERA OF THE THORAX OUT OF THE BODY. LUNGS AND HEAET TOGETHEE. Dissection.—The thoracic viscera as taken out of the body, en masse (pages 244 and 245), should be placed upon a dissecting board, with their anterior surfaces uppermost. The right and the left lung are to be held off, by loops, laterally, so as to expose the pericardial investment of the heart. Slit the parietal layer of the pericardium, from the apex of the heart to the anterior surface of the ascending portion of the arch of the aorta ; make two transverse incisions, on a level with the base of the heart. Eeflect the four flaps and hold them off, by loops, from the surface of the heart and the cardiac ends of the large vessels from its base. 1. Pericardium, Plate 141.—This membrane invests the heart by two portions : a parietal and a visceral. The parietal portion—consisting of an exterior fibrous and an interior serous layer—was partially described (page 240) and illustrated (Plates 136 and 137); its superior attachments, anteriorly, are to the ascending portion of the arch of the aorta, the common pul- monary artery, and the vena cava superior. The visceral por- tion is the reflection of the serous layer of the parietal portion, interiorly, upon the cardiac ends of the above vessels and the heart. 2. Anterior Surface of the Heart and the Large Vessels at its Base.—The portions of the heart that contribute to its anterior surface are : at the right and anteriorly, the right ven- tricle surmounted by the appendix of the right auricle, the latter to the right of, and anteriorly to, the cardiac end of the ' aorta; at the left border, a portion of the left ventricle sur- mounted by a small portion of the appendix of the left auricle— the latter to the left of the cardiac end of the common pulmo- nary artery. From the base of the heart, between the ap- pendices of the auricles, are projected the aorta and the com-

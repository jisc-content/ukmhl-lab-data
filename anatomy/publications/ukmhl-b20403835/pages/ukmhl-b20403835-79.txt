33 FEMALE PEKINEUM. labium it presents dartos muscle fibres, thus bearing out the analogy of a labium to the half of the male scrotum. Its pos- terior border, as it forms the anterior superficial boundary of the ischio-rectal fossa, will be noticed to dip more posteriorly than in the male, for attachment to the tendinous centre of the perineum. Dissection.—Section the superficial perineal artery and nerves, also the inferior pudendal nerve posteriorly, and reflect them anteriorly. Complete the removal of the fat from the ischio-rectal fossa, as in the male perineum, see page 16. 7. Gluteus Maximus Muscle—See Male Perineum, page 16. 8. Iscliio-Rectal Fos§a.—This fossa, in the female, is broader and less deep than in the male ; therefore its shape is less that of a wedge. See Male Perineum, page 16. 9. Inferior Hemorrhoidal Artery uud Nerve See Male Perineum, page 17. 10. Obturator Fascia.-The portion of this fascia that forms the external wall of the ischio-rectal fossa, has less depth than in the male. See Male Perineum, page 17. 11. Levator Fascia (levator ani portion or anal fascia).— In the female, this fascia is less vertical than in the male, and it has a larger area. See Male Perineum, page 17. 12. Pudic Nerve and Artery.—These parts are similarly located, and may be exposed in the same way as in the male. See Male Perineum, pages 17 and 18. Dissection.—Section and reflect the perineal fascia (Plates 13 and 14). 13. BfMfeelUattc Fascial Junction, Plates 14 and 17, and Fig. 3, Plate 16.—This transverse line of meeting of the fascial of the perineum differs from the male, in that, it extends more posteriorly for attachment to the tendinous centre of the peri- neum. See Male Perineum, page 18. 14. Superficial Transversus Perinsei Muscle, Plate 14.— See Male Perineum, page 19. It differs in the female in being much less developed, and passes more posteriorly to reach the tendinous centre of the perineum. 3

HEAD AND NECK. 318 2. Frontal Artery, Plate 177.—This artery presents superi- orly to the internal portion of the supra-orbital region, where it has a superior course exteriorly to the occipito frontalis muscle. Fig. 14. 3. Supratrochlear Nerve.—This small nerve appears inter- nally to, and parallel with, the last-described artery ; it per- forates the muscle to the same plane as the artery. 4. Superficial Temporal Artery.—The anterior branch of this artery (vena comes) is projected into the superior portion of the frontal area of the scalp. Dissection.—Cut out the supra-orbital artery and nerve from the interior of the frontal portion of the occipito-frontalis muscle (Plate 177). Trace the nerve branches to where they perforate the muscle to reach the subcutaneous- tissue plane, and follow them, superiorly and posteriorly, into the anterior por- tion of the vertex area of the scalp.

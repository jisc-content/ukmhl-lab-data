100 TRUNK. organ, where vessels, nerves, and ducts pass. The testis has a fibrous capsule—the tunica albuginea. Upon section a testis presents a grayish pulp which extrudes from compartments of the gland. 22. Vas Deferens, Fig. 3, Plate 56, and Plates 29 and 38.— This duct, about two feet in length, commences at the hilus of the testis ; it is a recognizable element of the spermatic cord, being like a hard cord of about the size of a thick knitting- needle. 23. Epididymis, Fig. 3, Plate 56.-The epididymis is the convoluted portion of the vas deferens; it is lodged posterior to, and opposite the hilus of the testis. Its portions are the globus major, at the superior end (in the figure at the right end); the body parallel with the hilus; the globus minor, at the inferior end (in the illustration the left end). From the last- named portion the straight part of the vas deferens is continued. 24. Vas Aberrans.-This is a short blind duct, about one and a half to two inches long, which springs from the globus minor of the epididymis ; it runs parallel with the vas deferens in the spermatic cord. 25 Artery of the Vas Deferens.-This artery accompanies the vas deferens in the spermatic cord, distributing to it and to the epididymis. 26. Spermatie Artery.-This artery is an element of the spermatic cord, distributing to the testis, the hilus of which it enters. 27 Spermatie Veins.-These leave the testis at its hilus, forming a plexus (the pampiniform) in the scrotal portion of. the cord ; from the plexus two veins result,, which form the ven» comites of the spermatic artery.

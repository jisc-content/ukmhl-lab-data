TWENTY-FIRST DISSECTION. POSTERIOR OF ELBOW, FOREARM, HAND, AND DIGITS. Dissection.—Extend the elbow, supinate the forearm, extend the wrist and digits, and place the forearm and hand with their posterior surfaces uppermost. Terms of Relation.—Those used in describing the elbow and forearm are the general terms (page 2) anterior and pos- terior ; and the special terms proximal, distal, inner, and outer. For the hand and digits the following special terms are used : proximal, distal, dorsal, inner, outer, and lateral. Bones and Hone Areas for Muscle Attach- ments, Plate 163.—The posterior surfaces of the distal end of the humerus, of the ulna and ra- dius, and those of the bones of the carpus, meta- carpus, and digits (phalanges, phalangines, and phalangettes) form the osseous plane of this dis- section. The posterior surfaces of all these bones, except those of the carpus, present areas for muscle attachments. Dissection.—Make skin incisions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of Figure 13 (if the dissection of the posterior of the arm has preceded, this dissection incision 3 will not be required); reflect flaps as indicated. If the anterior of the forearm and hand has been dissected, the skin will have to be re- moved; otherwise, the skin flaps may hang off from the sides of the limb. Find a bursa upon the olecranon process of the ulna; trace the veins and nerves in the subcutaneous plane of the forearm and hand. Figure l. Bursa, Plate 164.—A bursa presents at the surface of the olecranon, which varies in size in different subjects.

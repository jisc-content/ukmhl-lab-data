ANTEROLATERAL AREA OF THE NECK. 365 glossus muscle; thence it passes internally to the hyoid ends of the posterior belly of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid muscles, to reach the interior surface of the mylo-hyoid muscle (Plates 192 to 197, inclusive). Its branches are: the descendens noni (pao-e 361), from its curve upon the anterior surface of the in- ternal carotid artery (Plates 192 to 195, inclusive) ; and the nerve to the thyrohyoid muscle, given off as the nerve passes superiorly to the hyoid bone (Plates 192 to 196, inclusive). The anterior and internal portion of the hypoglossal nerve runs be- tween the mylo-hyoid and hyo-glossus muscles (Plates 195 and 197), to its disappearance, anteriorly, between the hyo-glossus and genio-hyoid muscles. 34 Genio-hyoid Muscle, Plates 190, 195, 196, and 197.- This muscle, located in the floor of the buccal cavity, interiorly to the mylo-hyoid muscle, runs at the side of, and parallel with, the median-line. It is attached : posteriorly, to the hyoid bone (Plate 190); anteriorly, to the inferior genial tubercle, at the posterior surface of the body of the inferior maxillary bone (Plate 190), near the median line. 35 Hyo-glossus Muscle, Plates 190, 192, and 194 to 197, in- clusive.—This occupies a plane interiorly to the mylo-hyoid muscle. It is attached : posteriorly, to the hyoid bone (Plate 190) ; anteriorly and superiorly, its fibres pass into the sub- stance of the lateral border of the tongue. DissECTiON.-Section (Plate 195) the right omohyoid and thyro-hyoid mus- cles. Restore the head and neck to its position on the block m Plate 194; sec- tion (Plate 194) the descendens and communicans noni nerves, also the exter- nal laryngeal artery; reflect the omo-hyoid and thyro-hyoid nmscles with the noni loop of nerves. Section (Plate 194) the right internal jugular vein and re- flect it interiorly ; then expose the right pneumogastric nerve and its branches. 36. Right Pneumogastric Nerve and its Branches, Plate 196 —The cervical portion of this nerve, lodged within the carotid sheath, has an inferior course: anteriorly to the rectus capitis anticus major muscle; posteriorly to the internal jugular vein ; parallel with, and externally to, the internal and common carotid arteries. The superior laryngeal nerve (Plates 192 to 197, inclusive) is given off from it, where it is in relation with the internal carotid artery (Plate 197); it curves internally, posteriorly to the internal and external carotid arteries, ap-

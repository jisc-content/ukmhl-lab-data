HEAD AND NECK. 394 the mucous-membrane lined interior of the anterior of the cricoid cartilage, and of the trachea. Dissection.—Cut the tongue from the hyoid bone (Fig. 1, Plate 207), also the stumps of muscles from the thyroid cartilage of the larynx, and from the hyoid bone. 3. Extrinsic Muscles of the Larynx, Plates 190, 195, 196, 197, 200, 203, and 204.—There are live pairs of extrinsic muscles of the larynx, which are attached to the exterior of the alge and to the superior cornua of the thyroid cartilage, and to the cricoid cartilage : two inferior, the pair of sterno-thyroid (Plates 190 and 195); two antero-superior, the pair of thyro- hyoid (Plates 190, 196, and 197) ; two posterior, the pair of in- ferior constrictor (Plates 190, 203, and 204) ; four superior and lateral, the pairs of stylo-pharyngeus (Plates 190, 200, and 203) and palato-pharyngeus (Plate 203). Dissection.—Swing the larynx and superior part of the trachea in the frame (Figure 15, page 378) so as to present the right postero-lateral face of the larynx. Clear (Fig. 1, Plate 207) the exterior surfaces of the thyro-hyoid membrane, thyro-hyoid ligament, larynx, and trachea, so as to display the following parts : the thyro-hyoid membrane, with the ends of the superior laryngeal nerve and internal laryngeal artery protruding through it; the thyro-hyoid ligaments ; the ala of the thyroid cartilage and half of the cricoid cartilage, with the crico- thyroid muscle bridging between them ; the crico-thyroid articulation ; and the crico-thyroid membrane. Dissect the pharyngeal mucous membrane from the posterior surface of the larynx, and expose the recurrent laryngeal nerve, the inferior laryngeal artery, the posterior crico-arytenoid and the arytenoid muscles. 4. Thyro-hyoid Membrane and Thyro-hyoid Ligaments: Plates 190, 194, 195, 196, and 197 ; Fig. 1, Plate 207 ; Plate 208. —The thyro-hyoid membrane is a stretch of fibrous tissue from the superior border of the thyroid cartilage of the larynx to the inferior border of the body and great cornua of the hyoid bone ; laterally, it gives transit to the, right and left, superior laryngeal nerves and internal laryngeal arteries (Pig. 1, Plate 207). The thyro-hyoid ligaments (Pig. 1, Plate 207) are the lateral thickened borders of the thyro-hyoid mem- brane ; they bridge from the superior cornua of the thyroid cartilage of the larynx to the tips of the great cornua of the hyoid bone.

The regions of the hand will be referred to as the carpal (carpus), the metacarpal (metacarpus), and the digital (digits). Bones and Bone Areas, Plates 121 and 122.— The anterior surfaces of the following bones form the osseous framework of this dissection : the dis- tal end of the humerus ; the radius; the ulna ; the seven bones of the carpus—scaphoid, semilu- nar, cuneiform, pisiform, trapezium, trapezoid, os magnum, and unciform ; the bones of the meta- carpus—first to fifth, inclusive ; the fourteen 8C bones of the digits—five phalanges, four phalan- gines, and five phalangettes (page 123).

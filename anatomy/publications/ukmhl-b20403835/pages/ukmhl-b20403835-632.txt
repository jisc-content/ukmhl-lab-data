294 UPPER EXTREMITY. 24. Dorsal Scapular Artery, Plates 161 and 162. — This artery (venae comites), branch of the subscapular artery (page 201 ; Plates 116, 117, 119, and 120), presents, posteriorly, in the interval between the long head of the triceps muscle, the teres major muscle, and the external border of the body of the scapula. It ramifies in the infraspinous fossa, and along its external border, distributing to the muscles of the fossa, and anastomosing with the infraspinous branch of the suprascapu- lar artery. 25. Suprascapular Artery, Plate 162.—This artery (vena3 comites) projects a branch, around the great scapular notch into the infraspinous fossa, which anastomoses with the last-de- scribed artery. 26. Nerve to the Infraspinatus Muscle.—This nerve, branch of the suprascapular nerve (page 293), enters the infraspinous fossa with the last-described artery.

14 Studies in Pathological Anatomy. Plate II., is a drawing. The vessels are sometimes well- developed, with an external fibrous coat, a middle muscular, and an internal coat; but, as a rule, they are channels in the stroma, with walls formed by a single layer of flattened cells (see Fig. 2., Plate II.) The Diagnosis between Papilloma and Epithe- lioma and the Degeneration of Papilloma into Epithelioma are questions which will be dealt with fully when we treat of Epithelioma. We may, however, here indicate the important points in the anatomy of simple papilloma, which are :— 1. The integrity of the basement membrane, and even, where this is indistinct, the preservation of the epithelium in an unbroken line. 2. The absence of finger-like projections of the epithelium into the stroma. 3. The so-called “ nests ” in the epithelium of the papillae bear no real resemblance to the “ nests ” of epithelioma.

20 Studies in Pathological Anatomy. Moure, who examined such a growth springing from the epiglottis, reported as follows (see Fig.):—“ i. A very thick epithelial layer, in which could be distinguished two zones, the most external one (a) formed of flattened epithelial cells, and containing a flattened nucleus ; the internal layer (b) composed of polyhedral uniform cells, with round and granular nuclei. This layer corresponds to the epithelial zone of the lingual mucosa, which consequently forms the external investment of the cyst, and has simply been raised Section through cyst, adapted from a diagram by Moure (“ Kystes du Larynx, Paris, 1881). The figure has been slightly altered by making the different parts of the section more distinct, and the engraver has reversed the drawing. by the latter; at its internal edge are found some undula- tions, and the thickness of this first layer is apparently more considerable than normal, being a true hypertrophy of the epithelium covering the tumour. 2. Below this first zone a mucous layer is met with (c), evidently much hypertrophied, exhibiting elastic fibres very marked and numerous, strongly coloured by picrocarmine: they are disposed irregularly. Numerous embryonic cells are scattered through it, and these are especially numerous at the points corresponding to the hypertrophy of the epithelial layer. 3. At the inner- most portion of the investing layer is a second epithelial

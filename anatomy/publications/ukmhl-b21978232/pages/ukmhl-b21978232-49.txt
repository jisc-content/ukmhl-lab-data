They resemble in structure the they are pedunculated (Fauvel, Elsberg, Kidd, Desvernine), but more commonly are sessile.1 They may be multiple (Wolfenden). In appearance they are bright red, blackish or purple in colour, of the shape of a raspberry or mulberry, and of very variable size; but the remarkable colour of the growths has sufficed in all cases to distinguish them. They are usually soft in texture; but Mackenzie’s case was described cavernous angiomata of the liver; that is, they consist of spaces, varying in size, but all much larger than a blood capillary, and separated by a trabecular stroma. The stroma is fibrous, and contains a greater or less number of round cells : it may be myxomatous (see Fig. 1, Plate VI.). A VI. LIPOMA Is a rare tumour in connection with the larynx. The four cases recorded in which it has occurred have all been extra- laryngeal. In the case recorded by Von Bruns the growth was the size of a hazel-nut, and was attached to the right arytenoid region ; in the other two cases, the tumour in one arose from the right ary-epiglottic fold (Jones), and in the other from the left edge of the epiglottis (Schroetter). The tumours consist of fatty tissue, enclosed in a capsule, which is composed of normal, but stretched, epithelial layers of the mucous membrane (Von Bruns). The fatty lobules are separated by fibrous trabeculae, and in Schroetter’s case large vessels were observed. Fat crystals have been seen in the lobules. VII. ENCHONDROMA. This is a rare tumour of the larynx, and we have been Unable to obtain any case for microscopic examination. Only a few cases, indeed, have been placed on record. These tumours have been observed attached chiefly to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, less frequently to the arytenoid. 1 A careful essay, by Elsberg, of New York, upon Angiomata of the Larynx, was published in the “ Archives of Medicine,” 1884.

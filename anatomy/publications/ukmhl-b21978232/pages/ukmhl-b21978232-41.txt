Fauyel remarks, “It is pretty rare to find fibrous polypi in the larynx” ; he had met with only „ cases out of 300 A good many of the cases described by this author as myxomata are, however, mixed forms of fibroma and myxoma. Mackenzie, on the other hand, remarks that fibromata occur next in frequency to papillomata. Purely fibromatous tumours, however, appear to occur very rarely in the larynx, and the commonest form of so-called broma is the fibro-myxomatous growth, or so-called nbro-cellular tumour.” Occasionally these are very vas- cular, and even angiomatous, but whilst mixed forms are the commonest, the pure fibroma is comparatively rarely met with. Fibromata are situated generally in the sub c7oXmSUeT(hMaCken"e)’ °r ^ SPnng fr°m the P- — chondrium.

STUDIES IN PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY, Especially in Relation to Laryngeal Neoplasms. PRELIMINARY REMARKS. We propose to treat of the pathological anatomy of diseases of the throat, more particularly in its practical aspect. Bearing in mind the ever-increasing literature devoted to the special- ties of laryngology and rhinology, we do not think it desir- able to occupy much of the ground which has been already well covered by many excellent text-books and treatises accessible to all. What we have desired to accomplish is the production of a series of plates and drawings of specimens, illustrating important pathological facts, of practical value to the practitioner, both as regards diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. The enormous clinical and pathological material at the disposal of the authors enables them to do this, they hope, in a satisfactory manner. A large number of specimens has been at our disposal for preparation of sections. Only the best of these have been selected for drawing, those, namely, which are illustrative of typical and important patho- logical points. Each specimen represents some hundreds of sections, and where we have not been able to obtain from our own clinical and pathological material specimens typical of what we desired to show, we have been fortunate enough to receive pathological specimens from fellow-physicians, whose kindness in allowing us to use the same we herewith gratefully acknowledge. We would especially thank Sir Morell Mackenzie for allowing us to draw upon his large collection of laryngeal growths; also Dr. J. W. Bond, for an excellent specimen of papilloma of the tongue; Dr. Percy Kidd, for sections of an angioma of the larynx; and Dr. Preliminary remarks.

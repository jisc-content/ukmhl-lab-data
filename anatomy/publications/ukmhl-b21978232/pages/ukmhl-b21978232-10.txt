4 Studies in Pathological Anatomy. Hunter Mackenzie, of Edinburgh, for an epithelioma of the larynx. The plates have been executed with every possible effort to secure artistic skill and truthful delineation, and have been entrusted to Messrs. Danielsson & Co., who have executed their task with great ability. The drawings from nature made by Mrs. Danielsson are models of artistic beauty, and our personal supervision has been constantly exercised to secure absolute accuracy of the same. In the first part of our work we propose to deal with neoplasms. LARYNGEAL GROWTHS, Laryngeal neoplasms occur as benign or malignant tumours. We shall treat first of the benign, or innocent tumour formations. These may be grouped clinically as follows :— 1. Papillomata. 2. Fibromata. 3. Cystic growths. 4. Angiomata. 5. Lipomata. 6. Enchondromata. 7. Myxomata. 8. Lymphomata. 9. Tumours composed of thyroid-gland tissue. 10. Adenomata. Laryngeal Many of these are merely curiosities, but it is possible that, neoplasms in . . general. were microscopical examination of the removed tumours more persistently conducted, some forms would be found to occur more frequently than is at present thought. For instance, it is not always easy to tell, from the clinical appearances, whether a tumour be a papilloma or fibroma ; and a growth removed by one of us, and presenting all the signs of papil- loma, was subsequently found to be a lymphoma. All laryngologists know also the difficulty of determining by clinical appearances whether a growth be malignant or be- nign. We have not included in the above list “tubercular and syphilitic tumours of the larynx,” preferring to deal with these under another heading.

This coiling, however, only occurs in mammals ; in birds, the cochlea is a short straight blind tube. All these parts of the laby- rinth are, when first formed, simple epithelial tubes sur- rounded by and imbedded in embryonic connective tissue. As development proceeds, and the skull begins to form, a cartilaginous capsule becomes developed around the several parts of the labyrinth, and this at length becomes ossified. The cartilaginous capsule does not closely invest the epithelial structures ; they are immediately surrounded by embryonic connective tissue, which forms an internal periosteal liniug to the capsule and a special covering to the epithelial tube. These two connective tissue membranes are everywhere separated from one another by gelatinous connective tissue, composed

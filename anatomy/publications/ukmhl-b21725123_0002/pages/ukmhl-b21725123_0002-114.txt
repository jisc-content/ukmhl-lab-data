(ESOPHAGUS, STOMACH, AND INTESTINES. 106 stomach is known as incsogastrium and the parts attached to the future colon and rectum are termed respectively mesocolon and mcsorectum. The stomach begins to assume its characteristic shape while still lying with its longitudinal axis in the Fig. 12G.—Front view of alimentary canal, rather less advanced in DEVELOPMENT THAN THAT SHOWN IN FIG. 125, D.

Lettering as in fig. 125. median plane of the body ; it is then seen that themesogastrium passes to its greater curvature (fig. 127), which, therefore, is that corresponding to the mesenteric border of the intestine. And as the pyloric extremity of the stomach and lesser curva- ture are tilted forwards ancl upwards, and at the same time the whole organ turns over on its right side, the mesogastrium becomes proportionally lengthened to permit of this change of position, and the right surface of the stomach (now posterior) rests against the anterior surface of what was previously the right side of the mesogastrium, the mesogastrium thus coming to form the posterior boundary of the omental sac (fig. 128). From near its attachment to the stomach a free fold subsequently grows over the intestines, and becomes the great omentum. The gastro-hepatic omentum is formed by the gradual thinning of a mass of mesoblastic tissue which from the first connects the ventral wall of the stomach with the anterior wall of the abdomen, and within which the hypoblastio outgrowth v]. 127 —Diagram of the mesentery, stomach and intestine of a human embryo of six ' WEEKS.

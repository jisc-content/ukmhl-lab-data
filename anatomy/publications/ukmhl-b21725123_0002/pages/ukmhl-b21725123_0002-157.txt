DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL ARTERIES. 149 to be opposite the point of junction between the fourth and fifth pairs of arches, so that now all the arches above this point become separated off in connexion with the trunk of the aorta (ascending aorta) ; the one below it remaining in connexion with Fig. 180.—Profile view of a human embryo of about 3 or 4 weeks, showing the principal arteries and veins. (His.) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the secondary cerebral vesicles ; hyp, hypophysis ; ot, otic vesicle ; rare, mandibular arch ; Ig. lung rudiment ; st, stomach ; Wcl, Wolffian duct opening into cloaca ; I, II, III, IV, V, the arterial arches springing from b.a, bulbus arteriosus ; p, pulmonary artery ; d.C, duct of Cuvier. the pulmonary trunk. After the separation, the aortic bulb, now a double tube, becomes still further shifted back, and with it the fourth and fifth arches. Since Fig. 181.—View from behind of the anterior part OF THE MOUTH AND PHARYNX OF A HUMAN EMBRYO OF 3 2 WEEKS, SHOWING THE ARTERIAL ARCHES RADIATING FROM THE ATTACHMENT OF THE AORTIC BULB. (His.) ao, point of attachment of aortic bulb in the anterior wall of the phai-ynx ; rare, liy, hr', hr1, first four visceral arches; I, II, III, IV, the corresponding arterial arches ; V, fifth arterial arch giving off the pulmonary artery,p. the inferior laryngeal nerve passes under the latter, this nerve must also become shifted downwards along with these arches. To allow for this shifting of the bulb, the common carotids become proportionally lengthened. From the descending primitive aortce on either side a series of inter-segmental arteries pass ; the uppermost of these become united to form the vertebral arteries (which subsequently unite superiorly in the middle line to produce the basilar), the lower form intercostal arteries. A branch for the upper extremity comes off from

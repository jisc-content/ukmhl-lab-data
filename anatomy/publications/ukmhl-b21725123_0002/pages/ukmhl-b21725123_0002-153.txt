145 DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEART. Fig. 174.—Diagram showing the DIVISION OF THE LOWER PART OF THE BULBUS AORTJE, AND THE FOR- MATION OF THE SEMILUNAR VALVES. (After (xegcubaur and His.) A, undivided truncus arteriosus with four endocardial cushions; B, advance of the two lateral cushions resulting in the division of the lumen ; C, projection of three endocardial cushions in each part ; D, the separa- tion into aorta and pulmonary trunks completed. Fig. 175.—Sections through the HEART OF HUMAN EMBRYOES, SHOW- ING TWO STAGES IN THE FORMATION OF THE CARDIAC SEPTA AND OF THE AURICULO-VENTRICULAR VALVES. (His.) A, from an embryo of 5 or 6 weeks. R. V, right auricle; L. Y, left auri- cle ; S.r.cl, right horn of sinus ; S.r.s, left horn of sinus ; V.E, Eustachian valve; s.int, septum superior and endocardial cushion (septum interme- dium, His) ; s.inf, septum inferius ventriculorum. This septum, as well as the bulk of the ventricle, is a mus- cular sponge at this stage. Oc, (Eso- phagus ; Br, bronchus. B, from a somewhat more advanced embryo. Ad, As, right and left auricle; Ost, auriculo-ventricular apertures ; S. s. septum superior of auricles; S.it, endocardial cushion (septum intermedium) ; S.if, septum inferius ventriculorum, now denser and more muscular; Mpp, peri- cardial attachment. Distinct muscular tissue is seen in the cardiac wall, even as early as the stage of an S-shaped tube, although the heart begins to pulsate regu- larly long before this. The muscular layer is separated from the epithelial lining of the cavities (endothelial tube of His) by a layer of clear gelatinous tissue,bridged across by fine fibres (embryonic con- nective tissue). This layer is most abundant in the ventri- cular part and aortic bulb, and here the endothelial tube is consequently much smaller than the muscular tube. Sub- sequently, in the ventricle, the gelatinous tissue is invaded by muscular bands which grow VOL. I.

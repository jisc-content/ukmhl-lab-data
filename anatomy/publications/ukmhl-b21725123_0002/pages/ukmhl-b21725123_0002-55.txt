CHANGES TN THE UTERUS. 47 Both the decidua vera and the decidua refiexa originally contain tubular and somewhat tortuous "lands, which were discovered by Sharpey, and were by him supposed to minister, in the first instance, both to the nutrition and to the attachment of the ovum, the latter by affording- depressions for the chorionic villi to penetrate into the substance of the decidua. It has. however, since been shown that these villi do not directly pass into the glands, but rather tend to become attached to the interglandular surface, and indeed at the decidua serotina, where subsequently the main attachment of the chorionic villi occurs, the gland- lumina may become almost entirely obliterated before the villi are here formed. But the greatly enlarged glands of the decidua vera very probably furnish a secretion to assist the nourishment of the ovum previously to the full establishment of the placental circulation.

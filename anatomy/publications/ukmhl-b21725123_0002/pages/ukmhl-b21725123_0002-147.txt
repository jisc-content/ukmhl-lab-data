139 DEVELOPMENT OE THE HEART. is found to open from the right horn of the sinus into the right part of the common auricle. The sinus now forms a transversely disposed sac, lying below and behind the common auricle, with a larger right and a smaller left horn (the latter being Fig. 167.—Heart of human embryo slightly more advanced than that shown in fig. 16(3.

The umbilical and vitelline veins soon open into it by a common trunk, which becomes the upper end of the vena cava inferior. A B oco' ■routs.. Fig. 168.—Heart of rabbit embryo. (Born.)

The slit-like orifice ol the sinus in the back of the right auricle is guarded by two valve-like folds ol the endocardium, which project into the cavity of the auricle (right

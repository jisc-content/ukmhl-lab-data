71 THE F1KST CEREBRAL VESICLE. The commissures of the cerebral hemispheres are also formed in the united portion of the mesial walls of the vesicles ; the anterior is the earliest to appear, thus coinciding with the early appearance of the corpora striata, which it unites in front. The anterior part of the fornix, with its pillars, and the corpus albicans (which is at first single and median) are next formed, followed at a later period by the posterior pillars, which are seen running backwards on each side into the cornu ammonis as soon as this structure becomes distinct. The corpus callosum is the last of the commissures to be formed. Its anterior part appears first, but as the hemispheres extend backwards the formation of the commissure accompanies the backward extension. The olfactory lobes are formed as hollow outgrowths from the lower and lateral parts of the hemisphere vesicles (figs. 70, 74). In man they soon show a division into two parts, an anterior and posterior ; of which the latter remains in close connection with the hemisphere vesicle, while the anterior grows out towards A 3 Fig. 80.—The surface of the f<etal brain at six months.

This bar is in all cases of less importance than the first two, from the proximal parts of which important struc- tures connected in lower verte- brates with the suspensory appa- ratus of the lower jaw, in the higher vertebrates with the ap- paratus for sound transmission to the internal ear are developed. Formation of the auditory- ossicles.—If the embryonic de- velopment of the bars is studied in man and other mammals, it is found that at a certain period of foetal life Meckel’s cartilage is directly continuous with the car- tilaginous malleus, above which, and at first in direct continuity with it, is the cartilaginous incus (fig. 199) ; these two ossicles therefore appear as the enlarged and modified proximal end of Meckel’s cartilage. Somewhat later the incus becomes detached from the malleus, but the latter long remains in continuity with Meckel’s cartilage (fig. 200).

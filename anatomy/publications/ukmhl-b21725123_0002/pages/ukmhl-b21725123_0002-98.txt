DEVELOPMENT OF THE EAH. 90 extenor. In elasmobranch fishes this connection is never closed, but remains 10V& 011 1 0 in ^le ^orm a sma^ duct-like tube which passes up through the cranial wall and opens on the epidermis. In other vertebrates the connection with the exterior becomes closed—in the chick during the third day—and what remains c V Fig. 104.—Sections through region of the hind-brain of human embryos, showing three STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OTIC VESICLE. A, auditory pits ; B, simple auditory vesicles; C, auditory vesicles beginning to be fashioned into parts of the membranous labyrinth. Fig. 105.—Outline of the right labyrinth of a WEEKS HUMAN EMBRYO, TO SHOW ITS RELATIONS TO THE PARTS OF THE AUDITORY NERVE. (W. His, jun.) a.b, section of bind brain ; g.v, ganglion vestibuli in contact with the upper part of the labyrinth ; g.c, ganglion cochlese in contact with the lower part. The fibres of the corresponding parts of the auditory nerve which have grown from these ganglia into the hind brain, are seen to cross one another ; /, facial nerve. of the original mouth, or canal of connection ■with the exterior, is visible as a distinct but small process from the upper and inner angle of the vesicle, and is known as the recess of the labyrinth (fig. 104 c, r.l). Eventually it dcvelopes into a long epithelial tube, which passes through the petrous bone, with an expanded end lying within the skull underneath the dura mater. This tube and its expanded termination form respec- tively the endolymphatic canal and saccide (fig. 100). In the meantime the auditory vesicle becomes elongated and begins to be irregular. Its ventral end projects as a distinct hollow process, at first straight, but soon becoming curved ; this is the rudiment of the epithelial canal of the cochlea.

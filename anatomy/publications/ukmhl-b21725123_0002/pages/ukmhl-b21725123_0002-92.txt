DEVELOPMENT OP THE EYE. S4 to the layer of rods and cones, while from the outer thinner layer the hexagonal pigmented epithelium of the retina, with its continuation into the uvea, is formed. I he invagination of the primary optic vesicle does not occur only opposite the Fig. 96.—Part of a section through the HEAD OF AN EARLY HUMAN EMBRYO, SHOWING THE CONNECTION OF THE PRIMARY OPTIC VESI- CLES WITH THE FOREBRAIN. (His.) olf, olfactory area of epiblast; c.li, part of forebrain which gives rise to cerebral hemi- spheres ; th, thalamencephalon ; p.o.v, primary optic vesicles. Fig. 97.—Section throdgh the same part of a MORE ADVANCED EMBRYO, IN WHICH THE LENS IN- VAGINATION IS FORMED, AND THE PRIMARY OPTIC VESICLES ARE CUPPED. (His.) o.c, optic cup ; o.s, optic stalk ; I, lens invagina- tion ; c.h, cerebral hemispheres ; th, thalamencepha- lon ; i, infundibulum; olf, olfactory area. Fig. 98.—Vertical section through the middle of the developing eye of a chick of the THIRD DAY. (E. A. S.) The section passes longitudinally through the deficiency in the lower part of the optic cup, and shows the mesoblast extending in between the lens invagination and the pigment layer of the optic cup. thal, thalamencephalon; n.ep, neural epiblast; c.ep, cutaneous epiblast; o.s., optic stalk; o, o, cavity of primary optic vesicle; me, mesoblast; v, mesoblast passing behind lens to form vitreous; l, lens invagination.

W.c., connection of optic stalk with thalamencephalon ; Sp, cleft or fold in the stalk, where the arteria centralis retime passes in ; P, pigment layer ; li, retina; L, lens.

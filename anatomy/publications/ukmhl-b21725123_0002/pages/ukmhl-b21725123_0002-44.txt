36 CLEAVAGE OF THE MESOBLAST. along the umbilical cord, with the intestine. This is termed the umbilical duel, and the yolk-sac itself has received (in mammals) the name of umbilical vesicle (figs. HO, 51). Lastly, at the tail end of the embryo a Mncl-gut is produced. In the human embryo this appears to be formed by a protrusion from the posterior blind end of the enteric groove, and after the formation of the allantoic tube, but in most mammals Fig. 37.—Transverse section of the tail end of an embryo chick of the latter half of THE-SECOND DAY, AT THE VLACE WHERE THE VERTEBRAL SOMITES CEASE. «p.

Formation of body cavity.— At a very early period, soon indeed after the formation of the neural groove, two important changes begin in the mesoblast. One of these is the cleavage of the lateral mesoblast (which is at first a continuous sheet) into two plates, one of which clings to the epiblast, and the other to the hypoblast. The cleft is at first small (fig. 37, p), but accumulation of fluid within it soon con- verts it into a cavity, which gradually spreads until the separation is very extensive (fig. 39, p.p.). The layer of mesoblast which clings to the epiblast eventually forms part of the body-wall, and is known as the somatopleure; that which clings to the hypoblast forms eventually part of the wall of the alimentary tract, and is known as the splanchnopleure. The cavity between these, which is formed by enlargement of the original cleft, is the ccclom or hothj cavity (pleuro- peritoneal cavity of authors). Formation of mesoblastic somites.—The other change occurs not in the lateral but in the paraxial mesoblast, and consists in the occurrence at regular intervals transversely along the mass, of a process of thinning which produces its complete separation into distinct segments, so that when the embryo is viewed from above or below, these segments appear on either side of the neural groove as a linear scries of small quadrangular masses (fig. 38), which were originally termed

URINARY AND GENERATIVE ORGANS. 115 development of the DEVELOPMENT OF THE URINARY AND GENERATIVE ORGANS. The urinary and generative organs originate in connection with the intermediate cell-mass, a portion of mesoblast which is seen in sections of the early embryo lying Fig. 136.—Part of a transverse section of a chick embryo of 2 days, 6 hours. (Kolliker.) 2f° uw, protovertebra ; mp, lateral mesoblast; dfp, splancbnopleuric mesoblast ; lip, somatopleuric mesoblast; p, pleuro-peritoneal cleft (coelom) ; wg, Wolffian duct; wlc, part of intermediate cell-mass from which Wolffian body will become developed. between the paraxial mesoblast and the pleuro-peritoneal cleft, and abutting against the external epiblast (fig. 39, p. 37).

(Balfour.) gl, glomerulus ; ge, peritoneal epithelium ; Wd, Wolffian duct; ao, aorta ; vie, mesentery. Some of the cells of this intermediate cell-mass become differentiated into a longitudinally run- ning cord, which subsequently acquires a lumen, and is then known as the Wolffian duct (from its discoverer, Caspar Friedrich Wolff) (fig. 130, wg). Posteriorly the duct opens into the cloaca. The anterior part of the duct becomes connected with invaginations of the peritoneal epithelium, between which vascular glomeruli project freely into the peritoneal cavity (fig. 137). These glomeruli constitute the head kidney, fore-kidney or pronephros} Along its inner side, somewhat further back- 1 Hertwig. According to Balfour and Sedgwick, these glomeruli form the anterior part of the Wolffian body, and the head kidney is represented by the Mullerian invaginations referred to later on (see p. 122 and fig. 145).

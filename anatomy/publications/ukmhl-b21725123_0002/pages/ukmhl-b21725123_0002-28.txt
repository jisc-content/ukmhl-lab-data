20 FORMATION OF THE BLASTODERM. third or intermediate layer. This is mainly derived, as was first pointed out by Kolliker, from the primitive ectoderm of the groove, but since in this situation the two primary layers become eventually more or less blended, it is probable that the primitive entoderm cells also take part in its formation, although this part is in the mammal evidently a subordinate one. It is further maintained by many embry- Fi". 21. â€”Section across the posterior end of the embryonic area of a rabbit at the time OF THE FIRST SIGN OF A PRIMITIVE STREAK. (Kolliker.) ep, epiblast ; ax, its axial part undergoing proliferation (this is shown by the karyokinetic figures, h); me, mesoblasi becoming derived from the proliferating axial epiblast ; hy, hypoblast. 22. Longitudinal section through the middle line of part of an embryonic area (mole) in which the primitive streak has begun to form. (Heape.) The blastoderm is perforated in front of the (short) primitive streak (? blastopore, blp); a few meso- blast cells are seen anterior to the perforation ; ep, epiblast; hy, hypoblast ; p.sh, primitive streak. 23 Two sections across the embryonic area of a blastoderm at the stage shown in e' ' FIG. 19.

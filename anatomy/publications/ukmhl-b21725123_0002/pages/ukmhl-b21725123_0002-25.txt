FORMATION OF THE BLASTODERM. 17 sixteen dear cells and only eight darker cells, for the same reason. Farther, it is found that as the segmentation proceeds the clearer cells occupy the superficial part If the ovum and almost entirely enclose the granular cells which fill the interior 'fiSThe ovum next undergoes a rapid increase in size owing to the segregation of fluid between the clear superficial layer of cells and the enclosed granular segments, which thus become separated from one another except at one part (fig. 14, b). At the same time the superficial cells multiply, and, becoming flattened out like a pavement epithelium, form a membrane enclosing the contained fluid. The ovum is now a thin-walled transparent sac, occupied by fluid and enclosed by two membranes, one pig, 14.—Sections of the ovum of the rabbit ° during the later stages of segmentation, SHOWING THE FORMATION OF THE BLASTODER- MIC vesicle.

Adherent to one part of the inner surface of this membrane is the little mass of dark granular cells which formerly occupied the whole interior of the mulberry mass, and these cells give to the part of the ovum where they occur a darker appearance, when it is viewed by transmitted light. At this stage of development the ovum has been termed the blastodermic vesicle (fig. 14, c, d), although the actual blastoderm is not yet formed. Formation of the blastoderm.—Soon the granular cells are found to be no longer accumulated into a small mass but to be spreading out in the form of a lenticular patch over the inner surface of the vesicle. As this extension proceeds the innermost cells separate off as a distinct layer, the separation starting from the centre and progressing outwards. A section through the middle of the ovum now shows three layers (fig. 15) : an outer, which is the epithelial membrane of the blastodermic vesicle (Rauher’s layer); an inner, which may be termed the primitive entoderm, from the fact that it becomes the innermost layer of the blastoderm, and an ill-defined middle stratum of somewhat VOL. i. c I

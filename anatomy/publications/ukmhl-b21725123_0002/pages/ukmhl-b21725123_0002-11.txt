3 PLAN OF ORGANIZATION. Fig. 1.—Diagram op an early human embryo. (Allen Thomson.) s, indications of the vertebral divisions along the line of the hack ; r, u, upper limb ; t, f, lower limb ; u, umbilical cord. In the cranial part the divisions of the brain are indicated, together with the eye, and au, the auditory vesicle ; near b, the visceral arches and clefts of the head, forming inter alia the rudiments of the upper and lower jaws. Fig. 2.—Semidiagrammatic view of a longitudinal section op the embryo represented in FIGURE 1; SHOWING THE RELATIONS OP THE PRINCIPAL SYSTEMS AND ORGANS. (Allen Thomson.) l, 2, 3, 4, 5, primary divisions of the brain in the cranial part of the neural canal; n, n, spinal cord in the vertebral part of the canal ; s, spinous process of one of the vertebive ; c/t, chorda dorsalis run- ning through the axis of the vertebral centra ; c/t', the same extending into the base of the cranium : a, dorsal aorta ; p, pharyngeal cavity ; i, i, alimentary canal: h, ventricular part of the heart, with which the arterial bulb is,seen joining the aorta by arches; b, visceral arches of head ; Z, liver ; w, Wolffian body ; r, urinary vesicle or allantois, joining the intestine in the cloaca, cl; it, n1, umbilicus. Fig. 3.—Transverse section (diagrammatic) of the trunk of the embryo through the upper limbs. (Allen Thomson.) m, spinal cord ; n, neural or dorsal arch, including bone, muscle, skin, roots of the nerves, &c. ; eh, chorda dorsalis, surrounded by the vertebral body or centrum ; v, ventral or visceral arch, or wall of the body ; p, p, body cavity ; i, alimentary canal; h, heart; Z, Z, the rudimentary limbs. I'ig. 4.—First dorsal vertebra with the first rib and upper part op the sternum, seen from ABOVE. £. 6', centrum ; N, neural cavity ; V, cavity of the chest, visceral cavity. B 2

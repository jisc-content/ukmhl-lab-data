DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPINAL CORD. 58 termed myelosponghtm, and the cells by which it is formed are spoken of as snomrio- blasts (His) (fig. 01). Between the inner ends of the columnar epithelium cells or spongioblasts there is seen at a comparatively early period (four and five weeks in the human embryo) a numbei ol loundcd cells, with a considerable amount ol clear protoplasm, forming Fig. 61.—Myelospongium from spinal cord op three and a hale weeks human embryo (His) Fig. 62.—Inner ends of spongioblasts with germinal cells, <j, between them ; from SPINAL COED OF HUMAN EMBRYO (His).

Fig. 61.—Three neuroblasts, each with a nerve-fibre process growing out beyond the BASEMENT MEMBRANE OF THE EMBRYONIC SPINAL CORD (His). an interrupted layer in this innermost zone. Their nuclei are mostly in one stage or another of karyokinesis (fig. 62). They are termed by His the germinal cells, and according to him they give origin to the cells next to be described. The third kind of cell (neuroblast) met with in the cord of the early embryo is one with a relatively large oval nucleus, and little protoplasm, but with a tapering protoplasmic prolongation directed outwards towards the surface of the cord. These cells are found in groups, at first only in or near the layer of germinal cells (fig. 63), but subsequently in the outer layers (fig. 64). The prolongations are the com- mencements of the nerve-fibres, and they mostly converge either straight or with an arcuate course towards what will subsequently be the place of exit of the fibres of the anterior roots. The outermost layer of the embryonic cord after the differentiation of the various kinds of cells above described is free from nuclei, and is composed of the partly reticulated, partly radially arranged external or attached extremities of the

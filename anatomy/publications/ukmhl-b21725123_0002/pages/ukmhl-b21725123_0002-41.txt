THE NOTOCHORD. ‘33 Fig. 34.—A SERIES OP TRANSVERSE SECTIONS THROUGH THE NEURENTERIC AND NOTOCHORDAL CANAL op a mole embryo. (Heape.) The embryo was slightly more advanced than the one represented in Fig. 25. The dorsal opening is shown in I., continued into the primitive groove ; the canal passes thence through the column of cells which unites the epiblast and hypoblast at the front of the primitive streak (II.), into the noto- chordal thickening of the hypoblast (III.), along which it extends for some distance (IV.), and eventually opens vcntrally (V.) into a median groove, which is formed in the notochordal thickening (n.c/i.c.) ep, me, hy, epiblast, mesoblast, hypoblast ; p.cjr. (in I. and II.), primitive groove ; e, ucu rente vie or notochordal canal; m.gr. (in III., IV., and Y. j, medullary groove. VOL. i. D

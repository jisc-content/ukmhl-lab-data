THE WOLFFIAN DUCT AND BODY. 119 are observed developing in the bowl of the spoon from mesoblast cells, which presently become entirely enclosed by the end of the tube. Subsequently a second Fig. 141.—Transverse section through the trunk op a duck embryo with about twenty-pour mesoblastio somites. (Balfour.) am, amnion; so, somatopleure; sp, splanchnopleure ; wd, Wolffian duct; st, segmental tube with peritoneal involution ; ca.v, cardinal vein ; m.s, muscle-plate ; sp.g, spinal ganglion ; sp.c. spinal cord ; ch, notochord ; ao, aorta; hy, hypoblast. and a third set of tubes become developed in a similar manner, but without perito- neal invaginations, and also open directly into the Wolffian duct. Lastly, other tubes Fig. 142.—Transverse sections op sheep embryoes, showing two stages in the development op the wolffian body. (Bonnet.) w.d, Wolffian duct; w. b, Wolffian body; p.v, protovertebra ; ch, notochord; n.c, neural canal; am, amnion ; ao, aorta ; i, intestine; y.s, yolk-sac. with glomeruli become formed between, and open into those which are already connected with that duct. All these tubes are short and straight when first deve- loped, but afterwards lengthen and become converted into convoluted uriniferous tubes, which, like those of the permanent kidneys, begin in a dilated extremity enclosing a tuft of capillary blood-vessels (glomerulus), which are supplied by branches of the primitive aortas.

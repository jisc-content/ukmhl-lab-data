121 SUPRARENAL CAPSULES. Wolffian body to take part in the formation of the suprarenal capsules have been derived by proliferation from the germinal epithelium.) It had long been believed that the two parts of these organs, cortical and medullary, are separate in origin ; the former being derived, as was thought, from cells which are of mesoblastic origin, the latter being developed in connection with°the sympathetic ganglia. In elasmobranchs and some other lower vertebrates, they Fig. 144. —Internal organs of a female human foetus of 3^ inches long, or about 14 weeks. Magnified (from Wakleyer). o, the ovary full of primordial ova ; c, tubes of the upper part of the Wolffian body forming the epoophoron (parovarium of Kobelt) ; W, the lower part of the Wolffian body forming the paroophoron of His and Waldeyer ; it/, the Wolffian duct; M, the Mullerian duct ; m', its upper fimbriated opening.

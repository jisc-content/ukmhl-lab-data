SECTION III. Pathological. 61 Skeleton of a life-guards man. The anterior surfaee of several of the bodies of the vertebrae are affected with exostoses ; which in time would have produced an- chylosis. 62 Skeleton of an adult female. The external surface of the bones of the cranium, and those belonging to the thighs and legs, show the dreadful effects of syphilis, and the abuse of mercury. 63 Cranium of an adult. The shape round; the os frontis immensely large, and the fore-head well developed. The sagittal and lambdoidal sutures are nearly obli- terated. On the left side of the skull, a portion of the parietal, temporal, and sphenoid bones present a rounded appearance, very different from the opposite side; and there is a slight crack or fissure of the external table, extending from the base of the zygoma, across the parietal bone : whether this was produced by accident or not, I cannot say, not having the history of the case. 64 Cranium of an adult. The forehead is low, the sides of the skull very flat, and the frontal sinuses very pro- minent as in the Negro. On the right side of the frontal bone, about a quarter of an inch from the supra-orbital fissure for the blood-vessels, there is a slight fracture of the external table, with depression; and a little beyond this part, the bone appears to have been destroyed by ulceration. The bones of the nose are considerably inclined to the left side, producing a very curious appearance; yet they are not separated from their sutures. The history of this case is not known; probably the morbid changes in the frontal bones, were occasioned by accident; and the unnatural appearance of the bones of the nose congenital.

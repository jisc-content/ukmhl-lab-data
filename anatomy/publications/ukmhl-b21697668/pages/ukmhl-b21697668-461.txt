415 effusion of blood between the decidua and chorion, which was firmly coagulated, and there were no signs of an embryo. 1627 A morbid ovum, similar to the one last described, and at the same period of gestation. Both these ova were expelled at different periods from the same person, and the haemorrhage in both cases was very profuse. 1628 An ovum, at about the 7th week, the decidua, chorion, and amnion shown, and the umbilical cord, but there were no signs of an embryo. A false con- ception,â€”pseudocyesis. It is very difficult to account for what has been termed false conceptions, all the involucra of the ovum and the umbilical cord are perfectly developed, yet there is no appearance of an embryo. Are these strange changes produced by excitement without inter- course, or had the life of the embryo been de- stroyed by some cause in the uterus ? 1629 An ovum, at the 8th week, the decidua removed to show the vessels belonging to the chorion. 1630 An ovum, at about the 8th week, the chorion and am- nion shown, also the embryo. The foetus was shrivelled ; this was easily accounted for by the mother having suffered from profuse ute- rine haemorrhage for several days previous to abor- tion. 1631 An ovum, at the 8th week, containing twins. The chorion and amnion preserved. 1632 An ovum, the decidua shown, also the chorion and amnion. The embryo was shrivelled and disco- lored, proving that it had lost its vitality by blood having been extravasated between the decidua and the chorion. 1633 An ovum, at about the 9th week, the chorion and amnion shown, also the embryo. 1634 An ovum, at about the 10th week, the decidua, chorion, amnion, and the embryo, are in the preparation. This is a very beautiful specimen. 1635 An ovum, at about the 10th week; all the involucra are natural, and an umbilical cord formed, yet there is no appearance of an embryo. 1636 An embryo, at about the 10th week, liver shown. 1637 An embryo, between the second and third month.

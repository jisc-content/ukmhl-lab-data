471 nearly the whole of the first division and a portion of the second, but they were affected with melanosis, the latter to a great extent. All the cartilages of the ribs connected with the sac were blackened by melanoid secretion, as was the pleura costalis. If the man had lived much longer, the integuments covering the tumor would have sphacelated. This is a very remarkable case of melanosis, combined with fungus haematodes and carcinoma. I have seen melanosis in the sternum, a case of which was published in the Royal Medico-Chirurgical Transactions,and this preparation, with many others from the same patient, are in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. I have also seen carcinoma in the sternum of a woman, whose mamma was affected with the same disease. In consequence of a considerable portion of the sternum having been absorbed in this case, and the heart's action having heen felt so distinctly near the surface, I was not surprised that the gentlemen attending the patient should have imagined that the symptoms were those denoting aneurism of the heart or of the arch of the aorta. See the Section on Diseased Kidnies, also the cast of the Tumor. MISCELLANEOUS PREPARATIONS. Normal and Morbid. 1782 Parietal bone of a foetus, dried and preserved in spirit, to show the arrangement of the osseous structure. 1783 Parietal bone of a child who died of hydrocephalus acutus. The bone is greatly developed. The arteries were minutely injected with size and vermillion, afterwards dried, and preserved in spirit of turpentine. This is a very beautiful preparation. 1784 Parietal bone, with the dura mater. The bone was extremely vascular ; the parts having been put into alcohol, the blood-vessels are visible. The two last specimens from the same subject.

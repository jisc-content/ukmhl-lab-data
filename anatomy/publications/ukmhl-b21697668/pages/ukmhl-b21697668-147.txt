The lungs contained a great number of tubercles, and there were several excavations. The liver and mesenteric glands were affected with the same disease, also the mucous glands of the small intestines. On dissecting the head, the bones be- longing to the superior part of the skull were in a carious state. Was this morbid change in the bones produced by syphilis, or by the imprudent use of mercury ? And might not the effects have excited into action the tubercles in the lungs, which probably had existed for many years, or from birth in a pas- sive state, and which might have remained in the same condition for many more years. I have frequently noticed the bad effects of mercury on those of a scrofulous diathesis. 356 Arm of an adult, the arteries injected. 357 Arm of an adult, the arteries injected. 358 Arm of an adult, the arteries injected. 359 Arm of an adult, the arteries and veins minutely injected. 360 Arm of a child, the arteries injected, the nerves shown. 361 Arm of a child, the arteries injected. 362 Arm injected.

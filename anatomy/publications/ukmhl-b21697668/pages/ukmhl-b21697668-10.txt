" The addition of one-third of new matter to the present volume, and the care with which the whole has been revised and corrected, will, I trust, sufficiently prove my respect for the favour- able opinion of my professional brethren, as evinced, not in this country only, but also on the European and American continents, by the sale of no less than six or seven editions and trans- lations in as many years."—Extract from Preface.

It must be superfluous to express our opinion of its value to the surgical practitioner. As a treatise on hernia, presenting a complete view of the literature of the subject, it stands in the first rank."—Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal. MR.

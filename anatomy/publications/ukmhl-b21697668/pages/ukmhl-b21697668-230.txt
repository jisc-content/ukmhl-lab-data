184 in the head, and was occasionally seized with con- vulsions, which were often very violent; symptoms of hydrocephalus ensued, the pupils became dilated, and vision was imperfect. The membranes of the brain were highly inflamed, and there was a considerable quantity of water in the arachnoid cavity. The substance of the brain was highly inflamed, and on separating the two hemispheres, a considerable quantity of water escaped from the lateral ventri- cles ; the fluid measured six ounces. The commis- sura mollis had been destroyed by the pressure of the water; and the third and fourth ventricles con- tained a considerable quantity of fluid. In conse- quence of this pressure, the infundibulum inter- fered with the function of the optic nerves, and produced the amaurosis. Similar appearances I have often seen in inspecting the brains of those who had died of hydrocephalus. The spleen contained medullary tubercles. The mother of this boy had all the symptoms denoting scrofula. I have no doubt that the tubercles, and the malignant tumors were of congenital origin. A portion of the diaphragm is preserved in the prepara- tion ; the serous membrane inflamed, and slightly covered with lymph. 760 Lung nearly filled with miliary tubercles. The heart is preserved in this specimen. A boy, 12 years of age, who had been very delicate from birth, was attacked with cynanche trachealis, the symptoms were very violent, although active treatment had been employed. He suffered dis- tressing dyspnoea, and frequent convulsive fits, and died on the tenth day from the commencement of the disease. The pleurae were highly inflamed, the lungs nearly filled with minute scrofulous tubercles, and in some parts hepatised. The bronchial tubes, trachea, and larynx, were inflamed. The bronchial glands were converted into large masses of matter,not caseous but resembling medullary sarcoma, which compressed the bronchi, and lessened their caliber. The pericardium was inflamed, as was the

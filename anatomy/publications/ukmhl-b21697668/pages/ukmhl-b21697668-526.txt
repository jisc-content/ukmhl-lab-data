480 of the pleura pulmonalis is united to the serous covering of the diaphragm. The patient had suffered for several years from the effects of ovarial dropsy; she had been tapped several times, but the whole contents of the cyst could not be drawn off; peritonitis came on, which caused death. The sac had formed firm union with the serous covering of most of the 'abdominal viscera. The cyst was sacculated, it contained a glairy secretion, and on its internal surface there were a great number of serous cysts of various sizes. This would have added greatly to the difficulty and danger in any attempt to remove it by operation. 1806 Part of a very large hydatid, with a portion of its cyst, removed from between the fasciculi of the muscular fibres of the glutaeus maximus. A part of this muscle is attached to the cyst, which is shown in the preparation. The patient was a woman, 40 years of age, very healthy ; she had a very large tumor, situated in the right buttock, which had been growing for nearly five years, but it had only occasioned her pain in the thigh and leg for the last six months previous to my seeing her; she experienced great incon- venience in walking. The tumor was about the size of a large melon, the integuments covering it adhered firmly, and it was not very moveable at its base. Several Surgeons had examined the tumor carefully, some thought it might be removed with safety, others were of a contrary opinion ; the disease was supposed to be an adipose tumor. There being no probability of benefitting the patient, but by an operation, and she being very anxious to have any thing done to lessen her sufferings, I removed the tumor. There was very great difficulty in detaching the cyst, the subcellular tissue surrounding it being so much condensed, and adhering so firmly; the tumor was embedded in the glutseus muscle, and deeply seated. The cyst felt very hard, and on endeavouring to detach it from its base, several large arteries

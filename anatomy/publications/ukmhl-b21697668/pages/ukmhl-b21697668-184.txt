142 crura cerebri. The brain became affected, and the patient died. 504 A portion of cerebellum, with the arachnoid membrane, and pia mater. The arachnoid membrane and pia mater were greatly inflamed, also the substance of the brain. From a very plethoric man, who was attacked with ear- ache on the left side, which became very distressing; the symptoms increased in violence for three days, when a profuse discharge of pus escaped from the ear. The patient imagined the complaint to be merely the effect of a severe cold ; he did not think it necessary to ask advice, and only employed fomen- tations, and poultices. On the fourth day from the attack, symptoms of apoplexy appeared, and I was requested to visit him. He was quite insensible; breathing stertorous ; pulse full and hard ; and the vessels of the conjunctivae surcharged. A con- siderable quantity of blood was taken from a vein in the arm, a blister applied to the nape of the neck, an active purgative given, and cold water applied to the head, he lived only twelve hours. Inspectio cadaveris. All the thoracic and abdominal viscera were perfectly healthy; but the large veins were greatly distended, and the internal coat of the main arteries was inflamed. On cutting open the dura mater, on the left side, a con- siderable quantity of pus escaped from between the arachnoid membranes ; and they, as well as the pia mater, were highly inflamed, and thickened. The substance of the brain was very firm, and inflamed; and there was pus in the ventricles. On examining the internal and external structure of the ear, pus was found in the semicircular canals, cochlea, and vestibulum; and the lining of the meatus auditorius externus was in a sphacelated state. This patient might have been saved, if, at the com- mencement of the ear-ache, depleting means had been employed. 505 A schirrous tumor, found in the cerebellum of an adult; there was a considerable quantity of water in the lateral ventricles.

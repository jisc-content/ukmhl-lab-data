PRINCES STREET, SOHO, January, 1842. MR. CHURCHILL'S THE BRITISH AND FOREIGN MEDICAL REVIEW. EDITED BY JOHN FORBES, M.D., F.R.S. " We have now, for the first time, a Medical Review from the British press, deserving' of com- parison with the most celebrated of the journals devoted to literature and general science. The articles do not consist simply of au analysis of the work subject to examination ; but of a critical digest of all the information therein contained, and of all that can be gathered from other sources unnoticed by the author. The most profound research, extensive experience, and critical acumen, are brought to bear upon the subjects discussed; and the consequence is, a more satis- factory epitome of the state of medical science at the present time than we have met with in any other work which has come under our observation. The execution of the mechanical part is fully equal to the literary; and we have no hesitation in pronouncing ' The British and Foreign Medical Review' the first medical periodical in the world."— The American Medical Library and Intelligencer. " ' The British and Foreign Medical Review' is certainly the ablest periodical now published in England."—Journal of the Calcutta Medical and Physical Society. THE BRITISH & FOREIGN MEDICAL REVIEW is published Quarterly, price Six Shillings. The first twelve volumes may be had, elegantly done up in cloth boards, at the same price as the single Numbers. \* No. XXV. published on the 1st of January, 1842.

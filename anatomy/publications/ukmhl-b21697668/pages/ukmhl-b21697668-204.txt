The nerve itself was con- verted into a soft black substance, and expanded, after passing the foramen opticum, into a soft black tumor, as large as a small orange, situated under the anterior lobe of the brain, and partially penetrating into its substance.

From a corpulent woman, 45 years of age ; her general health was not much affected, until a few weeks before death, when symptoms of cerebral disease came on, and the patient died comatose about eighteen months from the commencement of the attack.

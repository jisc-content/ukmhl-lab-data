The patient, a man 23 years of age, corpulent, and of a full habit of body, was seized (after bathing in cold water) with symptoms of fever, and an erup- tion on the skin, resembling scarlatina, accompanied with head-ache, and inflammation of the fauces.

There was a considerable effusion of serum between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater, the latter was highly inflamed.

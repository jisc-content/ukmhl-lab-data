416 The head was of enormous size, which was found on dissection to have been occasioned by an accu- mulation of water in the ventricles, and an effusion of blood between the arachnoid, lining the dura mater, and that covering the pia mater. The viscera of the thorax and abdomen are shown, also the testes, which are very large for the age of the embryo. This is a very curious specimen. 1G38 An ovum, containing twins. The mother had given birth to several children; she imagined she had ad- vanced to the third month of pregnancy previous to the miscarriage. For several weeks she had uterine haemorrhage. The embryos were shrivelled; the cuticle had separated, and the integuments were partly putrid, proving that they must have been dead for some time. 1G39 An ovum, at about the 3rd month, with twins. The de- cidua presents a granulated appearance, the embryos were flattened, and the cuticle had separated, which was accounted for by the liquor amnii having escaped about three weeks previous to abortion. There was in this instance only one placenta. The umbilical cords are extremely small. 1G40 An ovum, at about the 3rd month, according to the cal- culation of the woman; but the embryo is not larger than one at eight weeks, and blood had been extravasated between the decidua and the chorion, which had become firmly coagulated, and formed into small round bodies, as is seen in the prepara- tion ; I have examined several similar morbid changes. This appearance has been termed " apo- plexy of the ovum." The patient had suffered from uterine haemorrhage for nearly two months previous to miscarriage. 1G41 A diseased ovum, without an embryo; the termina- tion of the villi of the chorion were formed into serous cysts. The woman from whom this morbid ovum was ex- pelled, had suffered greatly, previous to its expulsion, from uterine haemorrhage, which injured her health. She was 29 years of age, and had given birth to three living children. She imagined that she had, in this

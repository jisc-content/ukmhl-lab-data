434 Royal Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, with some practical remarks. 1701 Two sections of a breast, affected with what has been denominated " Gelatiniform Cancer." This mor- bid change of structure is said to be composed of albumen. Its growth destroys the natural structure of the breast; but the question is, Whether it should be classed as a malignant disease ? 1702 Genuine carcinoma in the mamma, with extensive cancerous ulceration of the integuments. The axillary glands were affected with the same disease. This is a remarkable specimen. 1703 Mamma, affected with carcinoma, and fungus haema- todes. The integuments had sloughed, and there was fre- quent hemorrhage. At the request of the patient the part was extirpated. The wound could not be healed ; there was a copious sanious discharge, and the patient's health became affected; the glands in the axilla were enlarged, and very painful. CEdema of the arm followed, and she was distressed with a cough and dyspnoea. She died three months after the operation. The lungs and liver contained a number of medullary tumors. The patient was 47 years of age. 1704 Section of a carcinomatous mamma, which had caused ulceration of the integuments ; a fungus growth projected externally, which bled profusely. The axillary glands and lungs were affected with the same disease. From an old woman. 1705 A specimen, showing a scirrhous state of the breast. The disease had progressively made its way through the integuments, and formed a fungus. 1706 Section of a mamma affected with fungus heema- todes. The tumor was of an immense size, presented a nodulated appearance, and felt elastic as is generally noticed in this dreadful disease. The integuments were of a purple color, the veins greatly enlarged, and the temperature of the skin much increased; at the centre of the tumor there was a considerable projection, and the integu- ments were so much attenuated, that there was every reason to believe that ulceration would soon take place.

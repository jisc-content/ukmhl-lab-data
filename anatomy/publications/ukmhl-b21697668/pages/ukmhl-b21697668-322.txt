276 largement on the convex and concave surfaces, resembling a number of small tumors; and the serous covering was semicartilaginous. On reflecting the outer surface of the tumor, it was found to be formed by hydatids, many of them dead. There were several medullary tumors in the left lobe of the liver; the gall-bladder and spleen were healthy. This is the only instance I have met with, of hydatids in connection with malignant disease ; the presence of hydatids I consider an accidental occurrence, and not the cause of the diseases. This perhaps would be doubted by Dr. Baron, who imagines that hydatids produce most of the morbid growths. 1156 A portion of liver, tuberculated ; the serous coat greatly thickened by chronic inflammation, and long bands of adhesion had formed between this surface and the peritoneum, as shown in the prepa- ration. The spleen was large, and firm in texture. There was a considerable quantity of water in the abdomen. There were scrofulous tubercles in the lungs. From a man, 40 years of age. 1157 A portion of diseased liver. The liver was greatly enlarged, and extended downwards to a line with the spines of the ilia. The serous surface was thickened, and there were an immense number of small vesicles on it, like small hydatids ; it was nodulated, as in cirrhosis. The structure of the liver was remarkably soft, of a pale yellow color, and nearly filled with small white scrofulous tubercles. A portion of omentum adhered to the external surface of the liver, as is seen in the preparation. The gall- bladder was empty and contracted, as were all the biliary ducts. The spleen was very large, and dense in structure ; its capsule thickened, and there were the same kind of vesicles on it as were found on the surface of the liver. The pancreas was healthy. This preparation will be described in the history of Morbid Spleens. The mucous surface of all the intestines was extremely vascular, and the mucous glands of the ileum were

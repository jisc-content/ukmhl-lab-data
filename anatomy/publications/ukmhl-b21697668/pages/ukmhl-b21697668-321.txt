275 occasioned by the cyst of an hydatid ; which I shall have occasion to describe. 1152 A portion of liver, with a dense osseous cyst near its surface, containing a shrivelled hydatid. 1153 Hydatids, with an osseous cyst; several of them were dead, from having been deprived of their natural nutriment; the cyst was separated from the liver to show its density. Taken from a woman who died from the effects of â€¢jaundice and ascites.

The liver was very large, its structure dense, and color reddish white, but it was not very vascular. At the posterior and inferior part of the right lobe and near its edge there was a nodulated en-

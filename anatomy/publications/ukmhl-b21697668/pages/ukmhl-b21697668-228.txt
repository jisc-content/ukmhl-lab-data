182 From a child, 6 years of age, who died during the erup- tive stage of measles. 750 A portion of lung, rendered nearly solid by sero- purulent infiltration. The pleura pulmonalis, is in parts, converted into firm cartilage, and there are a great number of different sized dense tumors on this part of the cartilaginous structure, resembling small pearls. There was water in both sides of the chest; the patient was an old woman 751 A portion of lung, in "some parts consolidated by tubercles, and condensed cellular tissue, and in other parts gangrenous. The pleurae thickened by lymph, and there are long adhesions between them ; these are shown in the preparation. 752 A portion of lung, showing the incipient stage of mortification. The lungs and internal surface of the bronchial tubes were greatly inflamed, and loaded with pus. This patient had a diseased knee-joint. 753 Heart and bronchial glands of a boy, about 8 years of age, who died of hydrocephalus acutus. There were several chalky concretions in the lungs, and some of the bronchial glands contained the same kind of matter. The boy was born deaf and dumb, and was an idiot. The brain is in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. 754 Lung, showing calcareous concretions of considerable size, near its surface. Similar depositions are frequently found in the bronchial glands. The lung is affected with melanosis. The history and dissection of this case are detailed in the section on Morbid Uteri. 755 A portion of lung, with calcareous concretions. Dr. Baillie, in his Work on Morbid Anatomy, says, " This is a rare appearance." 756 Lung, consolidated by small, aggregated, miliary tubercles, and condensed cellular tissue; the pleurae immensely thickened by organised lymph. The mesenteric glands were converted into caseous matter ; the glandules aggregatae of the ileum were enlarged, and some of them were ulcerated. From a patient 25 years of age.

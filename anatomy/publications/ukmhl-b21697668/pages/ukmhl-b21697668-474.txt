428 MAMMARY GLANDS. Morbid Anatomy. 1686 Part of a scirrhous tumor, with the nipple ; removed by operation. The nipple was shortened and puckered, the tumor was very large, and had all the character of cancer. The disease recurred, and the axillary glands be- came affected, as did the lungs ; the patient died six months after the operation. 1687 A portion of scirrhous breast, with the integuments and nipple. The nipple was greatly enlarged by the morbid growth, which is shown in the prepa- ration. 1688 A scirrhous tumor, with the integuments, it was ex- tirpated. 1689 Two sections of carcinoma in the mamma, with the integuments and nipple. 1690 Mamma, affected with carcinoma. The breast was extirpated. A section of the parts presented car- cinomatous tubercles of various sizes, and the nip- ple was greatly retracted. The patient was a single woman, 41 years of age, and naturally of a robust habit; she had generally enjoyed good health, except occasionally, being so plethoric as to require ab- straction of blood, either by cupping or venesec- tion. The disease in the breast had been making progress for nearly three months previous to her consulting me. She had experienced great uneasiness during the last three weeks, the malady had become more severe, and she felt pain in the axilla of the same side. A variety of means were employed to alter the state of the parts for about three months, which seemed to lessen her suffering for a time ; but the pain in the breast became more distressing, affected her health, and made her anxious to submit to an operation.

268 internal tunic shown. The muscular coat is more evident in the small intestines than in the large, it is slightly reticulated at its base, and is then formed into long projecting laminae or processes, pursuing a zig zag course longitudinally. 1109 Gizzard of the Sirus Marinus, showing the zone of mucous glands at the inferior part of the oesophagus. There is in the same bottle a tenia, which was found in the duodenum. Comparative Anatomy.—Alimentary Canal.—Morbid. 1110 Stomach and duodenum of a Dog, inverted, arteries injected. The animal was poisoned by taking half adrachmof arsenic. About two hours after swallow- ing the poison sickness commenced, and the poor animal seemed in agonizing pain ; in eight hours the vomiting moderated, a violent purging ensued, with strong convulsions, and he died twelve hours from the coraraeiicement of the symptoms. The mucous coat of the inferior part of the stomach appeared of a darkish color, as if the arsenic had arrested the circulation of the blood in the vessels; this is seen in the preparation. And this conjec- ture was made more feasible, from the fact of the minute injection having filled all the arteries of the upper surface of the stomach and duodenum, but not the least sign of vascularity could be detected in the parts which had been acted on by the arsenic. The mucous glands near the pylorus are seen,also the villi of the duodenum ; this is an interesting preparation. 1111 The stomach of a Hyaena, inverted. A considerable portion of the large end of the stomach destroyed by the gastric juice ; the ragged appearance of the coats is shown. 1112 A portion of the small intestine of a Cat, with the omentum, injected with size and vermillion. The animal had been in a bad state of health nearly twelve months, and was greatly emaciated; the bowels were much disordered. Inspection. Various sized medullary tumors were found beneath the serous coat of the intestines, and in the mesentery. At the inferior part of the duo-

The child died of phthisis pulmonalis. Spleen.—Comparative Anatomy. 1293 Spleen of a Calf, arteries injected with hard injection, the absorbent vessels with quicksilver. Pancreas.—Morbid Anatomy. 1294 Pancreas affected with carcinoma, the tubercles small. The liver and ovaria of this patient were nearly filled with medullary tumors. " The pancreas is subject to very few diseases." " It seldom happens, on examining dead bodies, that it exhibits more than the healthy structure."— Baillie's Morbid Anatomy. 1295 Pancreas affected with carcinomatous tumors; the pylorus is schirrous. From a woman 60 years of age. 1296 Pancreas, with a fungoid and melanoid tumor firmly attached to one portion of it. The history of this case is given in the 3rd Volume of the Royal Me- dico-Chirurgical Transactions.

80 arch large. The parietes of the right ventricle nearly as thick as those of the left; the cavity small; the pulmonary artery and its two branches extremely small, the valves healthy. A piece of green colored glass shows the foramen ovale. The uterine organs were very small, and there were scarcely any signs of ovaria. In one of the small intestines there were four volvuli, which were most likely formed a short time previous to the death of the patient. 290 Heart of a boy 10 years of age. History of the case not known. The lungs on both sides of the chest were highly inflamed, and the bronchial tubes and trachea filled with sero-purulent secretion. There was a considerable quantity of fluid in the pericardium, and it, as well as its reflected portion were highly inflamed, as was the structure of the heart, and the internal surface of the auricles and ventricles ; which appearances are preserved in the preparation. The parietes of the left ventricle are very dense, the mitral valve and auricle thickened by chronic inflammation; the cornea? columnar large. The foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus open. The aorta large, and the vessels at its arch; coats inflamed. The parietes of the right ventricle are rather thin, the cavity small, the tricuspid valve slightly thickened, the pulmonary artery very large, its coats inflamed, the valves opaque. There are only two arteries given off from the arch of the aorta, and their caliber is small for the size of the heart. The trunk of the arteria innominata is short, it gives origin to the right subclavian ; the left carotid is nearly the size of the innominata, and it gives origin to four different sized arteries; one I suppose to form the left subclavian, but as I did not examine the body, I cannot satisfac- torily state the names of the other three vessels ; perhaps the two vertebrals, and the inferior thyroid.

Normal Anatomy of the Heart. 273 A large heart injected with wax. 274 A heart injected with wax. 275 A heart injected with plaster of Paris. 276 A heart injected with wax. 277 Heart of a still-born infant, injected^ the foramen ovale shown. 278 Heart, lungs, and thymus gland of a foetus. Abnormal Anatomy of the Heart. 279 Heart and lungs of a child. The infant lived only- twelve hours from the time of its birth. The skin during life was of a very deep purple color, the temperature as cold as that of a frog, and its breathing very laborious. On inspection the lungs were seen to be more solid than those of a child which had never breathed ; and they sunk in water. A section of one of the lobes showed that the structure was nearly as dense as hepatisedlung; which seemed to be occasioned by the air cells not having been properly expanded at the time of birth, and by an effusion of blood into the parenchymatous structure. The pericardium contained about three tea-spoonsful of water mixed with blood; the muscular structure of the heart was extremely red, as if inflamed, and the lining of the auricles and ventricles was of a very bright red color, as was the internal coat of the aorta and pulmonary artery. The ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale were very capacious.

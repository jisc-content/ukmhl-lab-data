ELEMENTS OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY; being an Expe- rimental Introduction to the Study of the Physical Sciences. Illustrated with Two Hundred and Thirty Wood-cuts. 8vo, cloth, 12s. " By the appearance of Dr.. Bird's work, the student has now all that he can desire in one neat, concise, and well-digested volume. The elements of natural philosophy are explained in very simple language, and illustrated by numerous wood-cuts."—Medical Gazette. " This work teaches us the elements of the entire circle of natural philosophy in the clearest and most perspicuous manner. Light, magnetism, dynamics, meteorology, electricity, &c, are set before us in such simple forms, and so forcible a way, that we cannot help understanding their laws, their operation, and the remarkable phenomena by which they are accompanied or signified. As a volume of useful and beautiful instruction for the young, and as a work of general value to both sexes, we cordially recommend it."—Literary Gazette. " This work marks an advance which has long been wanting in our system of instruction. Dr. Bird has succeeded in producing an elementary work of great merit, which may be profitably used, not only by the medical, but by the general student."—Athenceum. MR. DELABERE BLAINE.

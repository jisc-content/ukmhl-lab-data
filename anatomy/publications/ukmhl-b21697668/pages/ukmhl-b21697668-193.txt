151 The structure of the knee-joint did not appear to be affected. See the dried preparation of the parts. Mr. Lawrence extirpated, at different times, some of the tumors. The first was removed from the eye- brow, in 1825. The second from the fore-arm, and the tumor adhered so firmly to the ulnar nerve, that it was found necessary to remove a portion of it; the third tumor was removed from the fleshy part of the stump ; and the disease had extended as high as the tuber ischii. Mr. Lawrence has described the history of this re- markable case in the 17th Volume of the Royal Medico-Chirurgical Transactions ; and Mr. Travers has quoted it in his Work on the Pathology of the Nervous System. A description of the morbid ap- pearances of this ischiatic nerve is also given by Mr. Swan, on the Diseases of the Nerves. In a pathological point of view, it would be difficult to decide, whether the morbid state of the nerves caused the growths of the various local tumors ; or whether the latter produced the bulbous enlargements of the nerves. In consequence of the agonising pain produced by the growth of the tumors, the patient's health became seriously affected; the symptoms were similar to those in tic douloureux.

" But while we thus enlarge upon the merits of the work as suitable to the wants of the student, we feel equally warranted in recommending it to the perusal of the practitioner, as fulfilling the intention of the author, in being ' a short, but complete account of modern surgery;' containing everything that is essential to the right understanding of its principles, and embodying the experience of the highest authorities as to the best rules of practice."—Lancet, July, 1841. " This work merits our warmest commendations, and we strongly recommend it to young surgeons, as an admirable digest of the principles and practice of modern surgery. We have looked completely over the most important chapters, and in all of them we find proofs of Mr. Druitt's practical knowledge, and of the tact with which he can give extremely instructive and yet condensed accounts of the various subjects that ought to be contained in a compendium of surgery."—Medical Gazette, July 1841.

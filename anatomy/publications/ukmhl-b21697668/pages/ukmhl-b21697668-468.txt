422 radius and ulna very short and joined together, and the thumb and index finger were wanting. The bones belonging to the lower extremities were natural. The left arm was greatly deformed, it was very short, and resembled a malformed foetal thigh and leg; the hand looked like a foot, with the great toe and two small ones, which appearances are seen in the preparation. There were no signs of a heart or lungs, nor any ap- pearance of a diaphragm. The oesophagus was very narrow, the stomach small, and the intestines were coiled into a confused mass, so as to make it impossible to distinguish the small from the large without unravelling them, except the rectum, which was distinct. On examining the pelvic contents, the bladder was found, but there were no signs of uterine organs, although the external parts of generation were developed. 1660 A child, at the full period of gestation.

The vertebra: of the spine were perfect, as was the

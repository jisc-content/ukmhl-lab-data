359 made by the introduction of a catheter. Several portions of the urethra show the effects of chronic ulceration. There were several phlebolites in the veins, near the prostate gland, some of them are shown in the specimen. The kidneys were granulated, and the pelves and ureters considerably dilated. There was a consider- able quantity of water in the right side of the thorax ; the lung was oedematous, and there were firm adhesions of the pleura in the left side; the lung was loaded with serous infiltration. The heart was large, its muscular structure soft, cavi- ties very capacious ; the valves were healthy, an oc- currence seldom noticed on inspecting old persons. The arch of the aorta was very large, it might be termed aneurismal, all the branches given off at this part were very large, and the internal coat was converted into bone and cartilage. The valves of the aorta were only slightly thickened at their base, but the coronary arteries were considerably diminished in their caliber by osseous deposi- tions. The liver was very soft, and sections of it presented the appearance of a sliced nutmeg. There were several large calculi, of various shapes, in the gall-bladder. See the Section on Biliary Calculi. The ductus cysticus and communis cho- ledochus were greatly dilated, probably by the passage of calculi into the duodenum. The spleen was large, its structure extremely soft, and the pancreas healthy. The abdominal aorta was very large, and the internal coat ossified; the iliac arteries were aneurismal, the coats converted into solid bone; the femo- ral arteries were obliterated by coagulated blood, which occasioned gangrena sicca, and the death of the patient. Case.â€”A man, nearly 90 years of age, tall in stature, and in his younger days very athletic ; he had lived freely the greatest part of his life. I was requested to visit the patient, and found him dis- tressed with symptoms of retention of urine ; he informed me that he had for many years experi-

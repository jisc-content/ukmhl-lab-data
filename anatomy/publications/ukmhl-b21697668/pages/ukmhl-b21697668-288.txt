242 formed beneath the peritoneal coat, and by ulcerative absorption, had destroyed a portion of the muscular and mucous coats, as seen in the preparation : the rest of the mucous surface greatly thickened. The ovaria were carcinomatous, also the iliac and inguinal absorbent glands. The patient was an old woman, who died of phlegmasia dolens. The uterus was affected with carcinoma. See the Section on Morbid Uteri. 1010 A portion of the inferior part of the sigmoid flexure of the colon, with a stricture. The stricture, from dissection, appeared to have been produced by chronic inflammation of the cellular tissue belonging to the coats of the intestine, and not by malignant deposits. The peritoneal coat, near the stricture is very dense, and the circle of the intestine presents an appear- ance, as if a tight ligature had been applied: the mucous membrane does not appear much altered in structure, except where the stricture is situated; there it is sphacelated, as may be seen in the specimen. The stricture was very dense, the aperture only large enough to admit the passage of a moderate sized bougie, and it was plugged up with what appeared hardened feeces. On opening the abdomen, a considerable quantity of serum, tinged with blood, escaped, and there were marks of very active inflammation of the peritoneum and its reflections on the viscera. The stomach, small intestines, caecum, and colon, especially the latter, as far as the seat of the stricture, were enormously distended with air and fajces. The mucous coat of all the intestines was highly inflamed, particularly the colon, which was ulcerated, and partly sphacelated. The liverwas granulated; spleen solid, and the capsule cartilaginous. From a woman, 55 years of age, who had for nearly two years been troubled with disordered bowels ; they were obstinately costive, and she was frequently sick and dyspeptic. About six weeks previously to her death, great pain was

From a woman 64 years of age, extremely corpulent, who had been confined in bed with paraplegia, for several months. The urine and faeces passed involuntarily, and the nurse not having kept the patient clean and dry, the integuments covering the sacrum and coccyx became inflamed, sphacelated, and the bones were denuded. Symptoms of typhus fever ensued, and the patient died. The theca vertebralis in the sacrum and the spinal canal, as far as the third dorsal vertebra, was in a sloughy state, and the spinal marrow and nerves were of a blackish color. The membranes of the brain were highly inflamed, and in some parts thickened; fluid was effused beneath them, and there was a considerable quantity of serum in the ventricles. The substance of the brain was rather firm, but there were no signs of apoplectic cells ; proving this to have been a case of serous apoplexy. The thoracic viscera were not diseased; the liver was large and granulated.

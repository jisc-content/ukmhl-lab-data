81 Morbid Anatomy of the Pericardium and Heart. 291 A heart showing the incipient stage of pericarditis: the structure is very soft, the parietes thin, and there is an extensive accumulation of fat beneath its serous covering. The lining of the auricles and ventricles was inflamed: the aortic valves at their edges slightly thickened. The patient was 58 years of age. The left side of the chest was filled with pus, the two lobes of the lung were completely flattened, and pressed against the external surface of the pericardium. 292 Heart showing pericarditis, the effect of acute rheu- matism. The cavities and valves are shown. 293 A heart showing the early stage of pericarditis, also the white spot of Baillie on the right ventricle. This is merely a slight thickening of the natural serous membrane of the heart, and not the result of morbid action. 294 Heart showing pericarditisâ€”injected. The patient, a gentleman 46 years of age, had lived intempe- rately. For several years he had been afflicted with symptoms denoting a diseased liver; about 12 months previous to his death, he was troubled with a dry cough, dyspnoea sicca, and symptoms of organic disease of the heart supervened, which gradually increased in violence. For about three months before his dissolution, the patient was dreadfully distressed with a pain in the ulnar nerve (in the situation between the internal condyle and the olecranon) which frequently deprived him of rest, and which was considered to be tic douloureux. Various modes of treatment were employed by the physicians who attended him, without affording the least relief. So agonizing were his sufferings that it became a question whether the removal of a part of the nerve would be advisable ; but as this would have perhaps only afforded temporary relief, the operation was not performed: effusion in the chest ensued, and he died.

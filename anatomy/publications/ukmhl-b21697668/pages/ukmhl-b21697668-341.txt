295 The biliary ducts were pervious, the liver deeply tinged with bile, and its structure greatly intruded on, by the formation of medullary and carcinoma- tous tumors. The spleen was very large, structure dense. The mucous coat of the cascum was also affected with medullary tumors, as was the kidney. The patient, 60 years of age, had suffered severely for nearly two years with hepatic disease; she was icteroid, and complained latterly of severe abdomi- nal pains ; her bowels were greatly disordered, the evacuations being frequently mixed with blood and pus. The peritoneum was generally inflamed, and its reflec- tions were agglutinated to most of the convolutions of the intestines by lymph. The liver was very large, and of the morbid structure I have described ; that part of the gall-bladder con- taining the bile, was distended with a very black colored fluid, which by dilution in water, gave out a deep yellow color. 1232 A portion of liver; the gall-bladder, with biliary calculi. From a woman 55 years of age, who had suffered from hepatic disease for several years, and died of ascites. The liver was very soft, of a pale yellow color, and granulated. The coats of the gall-bladder greatly thickened, its internal coat ulcerated, the effects of irritation produced by calculi. There was an ul- cerated opening at the fundus of the gall-bladder, adhesion had been effected between its serous covering and a portion of the transverse arch of the colon, and the opening had communicated with the cavity of this intestine, which in all pro- bability allowed of the escape of some of the cal- culi. The aperture had afterwards become nearly oblite- rated by lymph, as is shown in the preparation by a piece of glass. There was no bile in the gall- bladder ; the biliary ducts were very large, and their internal coat greatly thickened by chronic inflammation. This is an unique preparation. 1233 A portion of liver, with a diseased gall-bladder, the

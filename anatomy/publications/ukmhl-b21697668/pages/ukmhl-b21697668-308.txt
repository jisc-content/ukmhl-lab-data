262 numerous, and there is a zone of glands at the commencement of the duodenum, similar to that seen at the termination of the oesophagus of birds,â€”the bulbus glandulosus. The mucous glands in the duodenum are also very large. 1062 Ileum and caecum of the Didelphis Virginiana, or Opossum, inverted. The intestines of this animal are beautifully delicate, the villi of the internal coat, both in the small and large intestines, are very small and proj ecting. The caecum forms a very long, wide, blunt-pointed process, not unlike a diverticulum, occasionally seen in the small intestines of the human subject. The glandular aggregates and solitarias are very nu- merous in the small and large intestines. 1063 Stomach of a Myoxus Avellanarius, or Dormouse, inverted, to show a zone of glands at the cardiac orifice, resembling the gastric glands of birds. This structure was first discovered by Dr. Macartney. J 064 Stomach of a Rat, injected and inverted, showing the cuticular and mucous division of its internal coat. 1065 Ileum and caecum of a Rat, inflated, and dried. The caecum is nearly as large as the stomach of this animal. 1066 Stomach of a young Rabbit, minutely injected. The mucous coat of the stomach and duodenum is shown. 1067 Two portions of the caecum of a Rabbit, minutely injected with size and vermillion. The valves resemble the valvulae conniventes in the human subject. The internal coat is delicately reticulated, and the villi are very numerous, and appear like minute mucous glands. 1068 Spiral valve of the caecum of a Rabbit, minutely in- jected with size and vermillion. 1069 Spiral valve, &c. of a Rabbit, minutely injected, also the glandulas aggregataj. A beautiful specimen. 1070 Caecum of the Marmot, minutely injected with size and vermillion. In this animal the caecum is large and sacculated. 1071 Ileum and large intestine of the Myrmecophaga Jubata^ or great Ant-eater. *

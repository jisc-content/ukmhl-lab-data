A dense cataract in the anterior chamber; all the coats thickened, the vitreous humor absorbed; pus filled the choroid coat. Dray horses, and those employed in dragging heavy loads,and too highly fed,are liable to cataract; which I think is produced by a great determination of blood to the arteries distributed to the eyes, thus causing inflammation of the tunics; the capsule of the lens then bursts, or ulcerates, and the lens escapes into the anterior chamber.

â– 203 853 Part of a tongue, with the pharynx, larynx, &c. From a man, who it was supposed, died of cynanehe maligna. The internal surface of the larynx and trachea was highly inflamed when the parts were first removed; but the color has diminished since they were put into spirit. There was effusion of serum between the cuticular and mucous surfaces covering the epiglottis and rima glottidis, and the edges of the latter were thickened. This Specimen shows admirably the following natural parts; the foramen ccecum Morgagni, the tonsils, and the apertures of their excretory ducts. It must be admitted that angina maligna is a rare disease. 854 Base of the tongue, larynx, &c. from a man who died from the effects of syphilis and mercury. The base of the tongue was extensively ulcerated, and the tonsils destroyed. Comparative Anatomy. 855 Tongue, larynx, and trachea of a Monkey. The aper- ture at the base of the epiglottis leading to the chorda? vocales, &c. shown. 856 Tongue of a Lion, injected; the papilla?, nerves, and arteries are shown. 857 Tongue of a Cat; the cuticular prickles, and the papilla? are shown. 858 Tongue and larynx of the Ursus Lotor, or Racoon, showing the laryngeal sacculi, &c. 859 Tongue of a Puppy, about a month old. The thyroid gland converted into fibrous tumors of great size, which are very vascular. A growth of a similar character, only less in bulk, surrounds the arteria innominata, which caused the death of the animal. 860 Tongue, larynx, trachea, and chorda? vocales of a Fox. 861 Tongue, pharynx, larynx, and oesophagus of a Seal, injected. 862 Tongue of a Phoca, or Seal, with the pharynx, larynx, trachea, &c. 863 Tongue, larynx, pharynx, &c. of the Myrmecophaga Aculeata.

The prostate gland is not much increased in size, but it is con- verted into small medullary tumors, and some of them project into the bladder, near its cervix, which had occasioned great difficulty in evacuating the urine. The patient had suffered for nearly two years previous to his death. The lungs contained several medullary tumors of different sizes ; the trachea and bronchial tubes were inflamed, also the mucous coat of the ileum and caecum; and the glands were greatly en- larged.

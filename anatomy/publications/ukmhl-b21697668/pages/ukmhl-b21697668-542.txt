The thighs and legs are greatly deformed, and all the bones of the body are very soft, from mollities ossium. The alveolar portion of the jaws expanded by the growth of secondary teeth, and the surface of the skull is partly absorbed. The first and second teeth are shown. The animal died in a menagerie. 2158 Skeleton of a Badger. 2159 Cranium of a male Lion. The animal was in the menagerie at the Tower a great number of years. There were scrofulous tubercles in the lungs, and some of the bones were affected with exostosis. 2160 Cranium of a young Lion. The animal was born in the menagerie at the Tower; it was very delicate from its birth, and at the time the permanent teeth began to show themselves at the gums, the health of the creature declined, and it appeared to suffer great pain j the bowels were greatly disordered, and convulsions supervened, which caused death. The bones of the thighs and legs were gibbous, the effects of mollities ossium ; and the bones of the external part of the skull were partially destroyed by ulceration; the diploe greatly en- larged, and the bones expanded. The upper and lower jaw bones are very soft in structure; the temporary and permanent teeth shown. If the temporary teeth had been extracted at a proper period, probably all the morbid changes described might have been prevented, and the life of the ani- mal saved. 2161 Cranium of a Bengal Tiger. 2162 Cranium of a Leopard. 2163 Skeleton of the Myrmecophaga Jubata, from Berbice. This very singular Ant-eater was caught by the right hinder foot in a steel trap, the bones were so much shattered, that they could not be articulated for the skeleton ; the foot is preserved in spirit to show its configuration.

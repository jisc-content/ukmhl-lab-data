41.9 effect of suppressing the haemorrhage, and the na bent recovered The death of the fcetus I think was caused by the separation of the placenta. 1 he foetus was not more developed than one at the 5th month it as well as the placenta was nearly in a putrid state, which might account for the symptoms and disordered state of health the patient suffered previous to the miscarriage. Malformations of the Embryo. 1654 Skeleton of an acephalous fcetus, the vertebrae bifid A female, about the 5th month. 1655 Base of the cranium of a brainless monster, the bones injected with size and vermillion. On the right side the tympanum is shown, on the left the ossicula .rrr a aud'tus- Afetus, between the 6th and 7th month. 1656 A malformed fcetus, about the 7th month, it was still-born.

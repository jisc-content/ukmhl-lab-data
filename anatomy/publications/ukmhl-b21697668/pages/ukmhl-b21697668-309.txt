â€¢263 The internal coat of the ileum is delicately reticulated. The valvula coli very capacious, and where the ileum terminates there is an arrangement of mus- cular fibres of great size, which appear calculated to constrict the intestine at this part, and give support to the valve. All the coats of the large intestine are very thick, and dense in structure. The fibres belonging to the muscular coat are extremely large, especially those arranged in the longitudinal direction ; they are shown in the preparation The mucous coat is formed into large irregular ruga;, which appearance extended to the verge of the anus.

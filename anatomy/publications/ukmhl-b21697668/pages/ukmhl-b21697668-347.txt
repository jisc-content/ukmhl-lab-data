301 1259 Two biliary calculi. 1260 Biliary calculi. Liver.â€”Comparative Anatomy. 1261 Liver of a Baboon ; its substance nearly occupied by very large and small scrofulous tubercles. The mesentery was similarly affected, and the mucous glands of the intestines were affected with the same disease. 1262 A portion of the liver of a Monkey, with tubercles of various sizes in its substance, and beneath its serous covering. The tubercles did not present that rounded or globular figure which we notice in miliary tubercles seen in the human subject, monkies, &c. they were more dense in structure, of a white color, and flattened, particularly beneath the serous cover- ing, and partly resembled what we notice in the incipient stage of carcinomatous tumors. The me- senteric glands had also undergone a similar morbid change, and the glandulae aggregatae in the intestines were greatly enlarged. 1263 Liver, spleen, stomach, omentum, and pancreas of a Monkey, affected with scrofulous tubercles. The animal had been long domesticated. 1264 A portion of the liver of a Cat, injected, showing the acini, &c. 1265 A portion of liver, showing the absorbent vessels on its surface ; from a Deer. 1266 A portion of the liver of a Cow. The external appear- ance presented a pale white color, as if it were blood- less ; on cutting through its substance scarcely any signs of its natural structure were visible ; it seemed composed of dense reticulated cellular tissue, which is evident in the preparation; all the biliary ducts were immensely thickened, and dilated by viscid green-colored bile, and living fasciolae. The gall- bladder was in the same condition. The biliary tubes were greatly thickened, and osseous matter had been deposited on their internal surface. The animal was greatly emaciated, the muscles flaccid, and of a pale yellow color, as were the conjunctiva?.

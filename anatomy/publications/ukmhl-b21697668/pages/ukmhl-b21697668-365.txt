319 melanosis; the renal artery is partly ossified, and tinged with melanosis. The patient was an old woman ; the liver was partly affected with this dis- ease. There are two large serous cysts in the ex- ternal surface of the kidney. 1343 A section of a large kidney. The capsule greatly thickened; there was a large serous cyst on its external surface; it was cut open to show its size and density. On making a section of the kidney, its structure was found extremely dense; the papilla? large; the pelvis greatly thickened and dilated, and the ureter at its origin obliterated. The pel- vis was filled with chalky matter, which accounted for the obstruction, and the dilatation of the pelvis. The patient, a man, had suffered several attacks of gout; the synovial membranes of the knee-joints contained chalky matter. I have seen similar concretions in the bronchial glands of gouty subjects ; also in the joints. Some of the preparations, from my collection, are in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. 1344 Section of a kidney. The ureter obliterated, pelvis enlarged, as are the infundibula ; the whole cavity filled with a soft chalky substance; the natural structure of the organ nearly destroyed. The lining of the infundibula and the pelvis greatly thickened by chronic inflammation. The capsules of the joints of the hands and feet con- tained chalky matter; this is said to be the urate of soda. The patient, a man, had suffered severely from the effects of athritis for several years. Urinary Calculi. 1345 A kidney, injected with size and Vermillion. The kidney appears very large, from the infundibula being formed into large sacs, occasioned by a cal- culus in the pelvis ; the structure of this viscus is nearly destroyed ; the lining of the infundibula and pelvis is inflamed; these appearances are well ex- hibited in the preparation. From a woman, 63 years of age, who had suffered for

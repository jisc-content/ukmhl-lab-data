160 The brain was very firm in structure, and inflamed ; and the lateral ventricles contained nearly an ounce of serum, mixed with blood. The tractus optici and optic nerves were much diminished in size; but they did not appear of that dark color, noticed where blindness has been occasioned by organic disease in these parts, from amaurosis. The scleroticae were greatly contracted, and very irregular in figure ; they only contained the morbid lenses, with fragments of some of the coats of the eyes. I have given the particulars of this case more fully than any of the other descriptions of diseased eyes, as I consider it in many points very interesting. 678 Eye, the vitreous humor converted into bone, as is the crystalline lens ; all the tunics, except the sclero- tica nearly destroyed; the optic nerve not affected. From a very old man ; there was likewise a fistula lachrymalis. This is an unique preparation. Mr. Lawrence, in his Treatise on the Diseases of the Eye, Section 5, describes ossification of various parts of the eye. Malignant Disease. 679 Eye of a man 50 years of age, affected with fungus lue- matodes, &c. The internal structure of the eye absorbed, the sclero- tica and cornea distended with fungoid matter, and a dense structure, resembling carcinoma, in irregular tubercles. The optic nerve retains its natural structure. The history of this case is not known. 680 Eye, with a portion of brain, affected with fungus haematodes, and carcinoma. From a boy about 7 years of age. The left eye was affected with fungus hasmatodes; the cornea ulcerated, and a fungus protruded considerably beyond the palpebree. Febrile symptoms, with delirium came on about three weeks before death, and it was found that the child could not see with the right eye. The cerebral disease increased, and he died suddenly, about three weeks after the appearance of the fungus.

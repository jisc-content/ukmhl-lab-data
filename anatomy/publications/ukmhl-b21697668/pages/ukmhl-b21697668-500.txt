454 least appearance of vascularity; its structure re- sembled the white fibrous tumors which are fre- quently seen in the uterus, and it was covered with a very dense cyst. The plantar fascia was greatly thickened, and ex- panded by the growth of the tumor. On dissecting the parts, the growth seemed to have its origin from the periosteal covering of the meta- tarsal and tarsal bones, and it had extended back- wards as far as the inferior portion of the os calcis, but was not connected with the periosteal covering of this bone ; if it had, the consequence would have been an obliteration of the plantar artery and vein, and consequent gangrene of the foot. Moreover the plantar nerve would have been compressed, which might have caused tic douloureux. At the age of five years an enlargement was observed on the inner surface of the sole of the foot. Mr. John Hunter and Mr. Pott were consulted, and every attempt was made for a considerable time to disperse the swelling, but without effect. The removal of the limb was proposed, but the parents would not give their consent. The tumor increased slowly, but never produced pain ; it ultimately acquired an enormous size, and became so unwieldy and occasioned such distressing pain, as to induce him to have the leg amputated. There was considerable haemorrhage after the opera- tion ; the stump did not unite by the first intention, sympathetic fever supervened, but the patient recovered. I never saw a tumor of this character in such a situation. 1751 A small tumor, removed from the mamma of a woman, in structure it is not unlike what Mr. Abernethy has denominated " Tuberculated Sarcoma." 1752 A carcinomatous tumor, from the mamma ; the lungs and bronchial glands were affected with fungus haBmatodes. 1753 A portion of the upper lip of a man affected with car- cinoma, which I extirpated, and the patient recovered. The disease had progressively increased for nearly two years, but his health was not affected. The external

255 The caecum and its appendix adhered very firmly to the serous covering of the uterus, and its mucous surface presented a melanotic appearance. The uterus was greatly, enlarged, its parietes immensely thickened by carcinoma, the internal surface ulce- rated, the cervix destroyed, and the diseased action had extended to the mucous surface of the vagina. The disease had also made its way from the vagina into the urinary bladder, and long growths or vege- tations had formed in the bladder, near the meatus urinarius. The bladder was remarkably small.

What could a Physician or a Surgeon have done in a case like this ? 1031 Omentum, with carcinomatous tubercles. 1032 Carcinomatous tubercles, small, in the omentum ; from a woman. The lungs were affected with carcinoma, and medullary sarcoma. 1033 A part of the omentum, with various sized carcinoma- tous tumors between the surfaces, and that portion of the membrane on which the tumors are situated, is semicartilaginous. This is an unique specimen. The serous coat of the diaphragm, mesentery, and liver were affected with carcinoma, together with the stomach and pancreas. 1034 The inferior part of the oesophagus and cardiac orifice of the stomach, inverted; the muscular structure of the former shown. 1035 CEsophagus, with a portion of the cardiac orifice of the stomach, affected with carcinoma. A woman, 70 years of age, had been troubled with dyspeptic symptoms nearly two years, had experi- enced great pain and uneasiness in the stomach after her meals, and was occasionally distressed with

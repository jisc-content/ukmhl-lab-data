In the same bottle there are two ribs of a foetus, anchylosed at their posterior extremities. 2297 Stump of a man's leg; the arteries, nerves, and muscles shown. A sufficient quantity of integument not having been saved to cover the surface of the stump, the bones projected, the soft parts became inflamed and swollen; and irritative fever supervened, which caused death. 2298 Section of a knee-joint; the structure natural, some of the muscles and the cutaneous nerves are shown, the latter bulbous.

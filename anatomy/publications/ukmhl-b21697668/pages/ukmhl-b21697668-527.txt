481 belonging to this muscle were divided and tied ; fortunately the cyst was slightly opened, when about a pint and a half of transpareut fluid escaped, which proved that the enlargement had been pro- duced by an hydatid. The cyst was then freely opened, and a considerable portion of it, with the whole of the hydatid, re- moved. The base of the cyst adhered so firmly to the adjacent cellular tissue, and so closely to the gluteal artery (which was distinctly felt) that it would have been impossible to have avoided wounding the latter, if any attempt had been made to dissect away the whole of the cyst. The integuments were united by sutures and adhesive plaster; the wound healed by the first intention, the woman was soon able to walk, and quite free from pain. The pain in the thigh and leg had, I have no doubt, been occasioned by the tumor pressing on the ischiatic nerve. 1807 Two hydatids united, they were voided from the uterus. 1808 Two hydatids united. Expelled from the uterus. 1809 A large hydatid, everted, to show the young hydatids adhering to the internal surface ; they are remark- ably numerous. This specimen was taken from the substance of a human kidney. 1810 An hydatid, from the layers of the mesentery, it was alive when removed, and when put into luke-warm water, showed all the signs of contractility for a considerable length of time. I have filled one of these hydatids with size and vermillion, from its mouth. 1811 An hydatid found beneath the serous coat of the in- testinum ileum of a monkey ; there were several in the mesentery and lungs. 1812 Hydatids, very small and pendulous, from the omen- tum of a monkey ; some of the arteries are shown in the preparation. There were hydatids in the liver. 1813 Lungs of a sheep nearly filled with large hydatids. The structure of the lung hepatised; there was water in both sides of the chest. 1814 A small hydatid, from the brain of a sheep. 1815 A portion of laminated fibrin, from a large aneurism. I I

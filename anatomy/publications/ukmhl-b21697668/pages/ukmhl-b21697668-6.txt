" We have never encountered so singular and remarkable a book. It unites the German research of a Plouquet with the ravings of Rabelais,—the humour of Sterne with the satire of Democritus,—the learning of Burton with the wit of Pindar."—Dr. Johnson's Review. DR. B I L L A R D. A TREATISE ON THE DISEASES OF INFANTS; Translated from the Third French Edition, with Notes, by JAMES STEWART, M.D., one of the Consulting Physicians of the Northern Dispensary of the City of New York. 8vo, cloth, 14s. " This translation of Dr. Billard's work will supply a want felt to exist in our medical litera- ture. The author has enjoyed opportunities of pursuing pathological investigations to an almost unlimited extent; and, as the result, he has presented to the world a book remarkable for the variety and importance of the facts it contains. Of the manner in which Dr. Stewart has exe- cuted his task, we can speak in the highest terms."—Dr. Johnson's Review. " M. Billard held, for some time, a very important station at the Hopital des Enfans, and there he laboured with almost unrivalled industry and talent to shed new light upon the general pathology and treatment of infantile diseases. The work is decidedly a very valuable contribution to our knowledge. The translator has performed his task in a very correct and creditable manner, and his Appendix forms a very important addition."—British and Foreign Medical Review.

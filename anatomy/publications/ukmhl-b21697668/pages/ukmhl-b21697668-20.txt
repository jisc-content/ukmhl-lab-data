Fcap. 8vo, cloth, 12s. 6d. " This is probably the prettiest medical book ever published, and we believe its intrinsic merits are in keeping with its exterior advantages, having examined it sufficiently to satisfy us that it may be recommended to the student as no less distinguished by its accuracy and clearness of description than by its typographical elegance. The woodcuts are exquisite."—British and Foreign Medical Review. " Without exception the most beautiful specimen of book-making we have ever seen; it is got up in the very best style. Mr. Wilson has executed his share of the work in a very creditable manner; as a proof of this, we need only refer the reader to the admirable description of the ner- vous and lymphatic systems," &c.—Dublin Medical Journal.

Human Eyeâ€”Morbid Anatomy. 654 The superior palpebra, with an encysted tumor in the cellular tissue. From Bellingham, the Assassin. 655 Eyes of a man 64 years of age, with a portion of the base of the brain. The structure of the eyes normal; but the tractus optici are greatly diminished in size. The former do not decussate. The membranes of the brain are greatly thickened, and the inner surface of the dura mater partly cartilagi- nous and osseous. The structure of the brain very dense, and inflamed. There were about two ounces of water in the lateral ventricles. The arteries at the base of the brain are ossified. See the diseased membranes of the brain, and the knee-joint, from the same patient. This is a very interesting preparation, not only as regards the morbid appearances,but also as to healthy structure. 656 'Eye of an idiot, 7 years of age, who was born deaf, blind and dumb, and had hydrocephalus, which caused death. The superior part of the calvarium was extremely thick and solid, and very vascular. There was a considerable quantity of fluid between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater, and they were thick- ened ; although the brain was extremely small, there was a great accumulation of fluid in the ventricles, and the structure was soft. The thalami and optic nerves were extremely small. See the cast of the head and face. 657 Eyes of a woman, who had been blind for many years. She died suddenly in a fit of apoplexy. Blood was effused, to the amount of four ounces, into the substance of the right anterior lobe of the cere- brum, and there were two ounces in the lateral ventricles; the thalamus opticus on this side was greatly diminished in bulk, and of a darkish brown

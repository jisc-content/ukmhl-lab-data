5 of an accurate examination of its structure. One hemisphere of the cerebrum was punctured, and the whole quantity of fluid which escaped measured four- teen ounces. On dissection, it appeared that all the ventricles of the brain had been dilated into one large cavity; and there was a free communication between this and the membranes of the medulla spinalis; a considerable quantity of fluid was also found between these mem- branes. The tumor of the spina bifida was about the size of a large orange ; a considerable part of the integuments on the centre of the enlargement had been absorbed, and the theca vertebralis protruded, which was highly inflamed; these appearances are seen in the preparation. The tumor contained limpid fluid; its internal surface was highly inflamed; and the cauda equina branched out on this surface in various directions ; whilst the sacral nerves were dis- tributed, and passed through their foramina in regular order; this arrangement is well seen in the preparation. The lungs were healthy ; the ventricle of the heart un- divided by a septum ventriculorum ; the ductus arte- riosus extremely large, also the foramen ovale; the auricles very capacious. The left vertebral artery had its origin from the arch of the aorta. The abdo- minal viscera were healthy. Had it been ascertained during labor, that the child was affected with hydro- cephalus, it would have been advisable to have punctured the brain to let out the fluid, in which case the parturition would have been less difficult and tedious.

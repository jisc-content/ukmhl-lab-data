408 1586 External and internal organs of generation of a woman, with the bladder and rectum. The principal parts of the labia and nymphae were destroyed by sloughing phagedeena, as were the vagina, meatus urinarius, the verge of the anus, and a considerable portion of the rectum. The uterus was healthy, the ovaria were very dense in struc- ture, and all the coats of the bladder considerably thickened. 1587 External organs of generation of a female; the hymen shown. 1588 External organs of generation of a female foetus. 1589 External organs of generation of a foetus ; the hymen shown. 1590 An uterus. This uterus, in the anatomical arrange- ment of its structure, resembled some of the prepa- rations and cases I have read of, which have been denominated double uteri, but it is inaccurate to say that any of them are double, as none have more than the appendages which a single uterus possesses. The body of this uterus was nearly the size of the gravid organ at the third month of gestation. The cavity was divided by a thin muscular septum, and a deciduous membrane had formed; there were two distinct mouths, similar to the uterus bicornis of some animals. The bloodvessels were greatly distended. The Fallopian tubes were filled with a glairy secretion, and their internal surface was very vascular ; and there was a recent corpus lu- teum in both ovaries. The history of this case is not known. If the secretion in the Fallopian tubes and uterus had been carefully examined through a microscope of great power, perhaps the ova might have been detected. Female Organs of Generation.

The uterus of this animal resembles more closely that of the human subject, than that of any creature I have dissected. 1592 External and internal organs of generation of a monkey.

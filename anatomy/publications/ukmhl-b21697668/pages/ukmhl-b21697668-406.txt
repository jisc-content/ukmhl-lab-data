Previous to my introducing a catheter, I examined the state of the prostate gland, which I found greatly enlarged, and pressure with the finger pro- duced considerahle pain. I employed a catheter with a large curve (which I generally use in those cases) and detected an interruption at the pros- tatic portion of the urethra; there was diffi- culty in passing the instrument into the bladder. Three pints of very foetid urine were drawn off, hut in consequence of the bladder having been so greatly distended, and the length of time it had been retained, it became paralysed, and never re- covered its function ; it was necessary, therefore, to employ a catheter twice a-day, for a period of nearly four years. During the latter part of his life he frequently experienced great pain in the blad- der and kidneys, if the urine were not drawn off at the usual period; and the odour of the fluid was very offensive, it was frequently mixed with pus, sometimes with uric acid. About two months previous to his death, the inferior extremities be- came very cold; the integuments of the feet pre- sented a purplish hue, and pulsation could not be felt in the popliteal arteries, or those belonging to the legs. Sphacelation of the feet commenced, succeeded by irritative fever, which caused death. 1421 Prostate gland, vesiculae seminales, and vas deferen- tia.

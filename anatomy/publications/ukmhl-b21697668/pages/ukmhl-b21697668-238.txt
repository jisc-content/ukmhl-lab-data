192 abscesses filled with pus, which communicated with the bronchial tubes. The pleurae were united by lymph. The heart was small, its structure very soft; the lining membrane and the arteries inflamed, the valves healthy. The liver was very large, and of a pale-yellow color, but there were no signs of organic disease. The gall- bladder was distended with green-colored bile; the spleen large. There was a great determination of blood to the mucous coat of the stomach and intestines. The description of the appearances of the stomach and intestines is given in the Section on Diseased Stomachs and Intestines. A man, 50 years of age, had been afflicted with a severe attack of pneumonia. The dyspnoea was very distressing, accompanied with wheezing, and the expectoration of pus. The principal seat of pain was the right hypochondrium, and pain was felt when slight pressure with the hand was employed on that region. A short time previous to the death of the patient, he was seized with bilious vomiting, and the expectora- tion of foetid pus. I was requested to inspect the body, by Mr. Handy, Surgeon ; the history of the case, and post-mortem appearances, were published in No. 223, of the first Volume of the Lancet. 784 A portion of lung, consolidated by scrofulous tuber- cles, and sero-purulent infiltration; there are two abscesses ; the pleura pulmonalis was not affected. The tubercles are rather large. From a man 36 years of age. The history of the case is not known. 785 Lung, injected with size and vermillion. The lungs were partly consolidated by sero-purulent infiltration, and effusion of lymph; there were a great number of small schirrous tubercles in the lungs, and many of the same character, of various sizes beneath the pleura pulmonalis. This is a valuable specimen. The breast was extirpated. The description of r repara- tion is g^iven in the Section on Diseased Mammae.

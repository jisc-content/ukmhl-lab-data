SECTION II. Abnormal. 59 Spina bifida in the lumbar region, formed by arrest in the development of the arches of the two last lumbar vertebrae and all the pieces of the sacrum. A section of the preparation is made in order to show the spinal canal, its membranes, and some of the nerves of the cauda equina. The tumor was as large as an apple of moderate size; its integument was thinned and partially absorbed near the centre, and permitted the protrusion of a portion of highly inflamed theca vertebralis. After birth the swelling increased in bulk, although partly relieved by serous exudation; it gave rise to much pain, produced convulsions, and destroyed the infant on the fifth day. Upon examination, the arachnoid and pia mater were much inflamed through- out their entire extent; and there was a considerable quantity of fluid in the ventricles of the brain. This preparation is engraved in Mr. Crowther's Work on Scrofula. 60 Spina bifida in a foetus. There is a deficiency in the arches of the lumbar vertebrae and all those belonging to the sacrum. From a child still-born, affected with hydrocephalus. The labor was extremely difficult; the child weighed eight pounds and three quarters, avoirdupois e; the mother only twenty years of age, and the first child. I inspected the body. The bones â€¢ of the cranium were much larger and more extensively ossified than is generally observed at such an early period, they were also widely separated. The frontal bones were two inches and a quarter apart, and the anterior fontanel three inches and a quarter in diam- eter. The pia mater was inflamed, and all the vessels of the brain were surcharged with blood. The brain was too much softened by the contained fluid, to admit

322 of the bladder were inflamed. The ureters were large. The prostate gland was perfectly healthy ; but the urethra in its whole course was coated with lymph, and there were several small calculi found in the tube. The patient had a fractured neck of the thigh-bone, within the joint; it was united by ligament, &c. A plate of this preparation is given in Sir Astley Cooper's valuable Work on Dislocations and Frac- tures of the Joints. See the description of the thigh-bone in the Section on Fractures. 1347 A section of a kidney, with the abdominal aorta, taken from a young woman who died in St. Bar- tholomew's Hospital, of fever connected with pur- pura haamorrhagica. Preserved in alcohol. Nearly the whole of the skin was affected with pur- pura haemorrhagica ; many of the spots were very large and distinct, in some parts confluent, and petechias were very numerous. The gums spongy, of a blue color, swollen, and bled copiously ; and there was intestinal haemorrhage a short time pre- vious to death. The case was so far advanced when the patient was admitted into the hospital, as to afford no chance of recovery. Inspection. All the viscera were loaded with blood, more especially the liver and lungs; and purple spots were seen beneath the serous membranes and the mucous coats. The arteries were highly inflamed, more particularly the aorta and its branches ; and there were a great number of purple macula? between the coats, which are shown in the preparation. There was a con- siderable quantity of coagulated blood in the in- testines. The mucous glands were not diseased. The membranes of the brain were extremely vascu- lar, and water was found between them ; the brain was inflamed, and all the blood-vessels gorged. The patient was very plethoric; and as there were no signs of organic disease in any of the viscera ; bleeding, purging, &c. at the commencement might have saved the life of the patient. 1348 Calculi, from the kidney.

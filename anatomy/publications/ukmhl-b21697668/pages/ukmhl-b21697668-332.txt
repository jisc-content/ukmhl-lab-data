28Â« that the disease is one of the varieties of medullary sarcoma. 1199 A portion of liver, resembling in a slight degree, the structure of the tumors last described ; the cellular tissue is thickened and formed into small cells, which contained a thick brown-colored secretion ; the structure of the liver was very firm, and of a pale hue. The serous covering was greatly thickened by chronic inflammation, and there were several projections beneath it, resembling an aggregation of small granular bodies, which were found to have been produced by a secretion into the cellular tissue, similar to that seen in the liver. The history of this case is not known. 1200 Liver, with medullary sarcoma. In one of the tubera near the external surface of the liver, there is a central depression, which is produced by a semicartilaginous state of the serous surface. The patient, 59 years of age, had been addicted to dram-drinking for many years; ascites came on, which was followed by an attack of icterus a few months previous to his death. The liver was nearly filled with different sized fungoid tumors, and many of the veins were loaded with fungoid matter. The gall-bladder was thickened and shrivelled; the spleen large and solid. There was a considerable quantity of water in the abdomen. The case and dissection are published in the 8th Vol. of the Royal Medico-Chirurgical Transactions. 1201 Liver affected with fungus haematodes and carcinoma. The lungs were affected with the same diseases. The patient died of ascites. 1202 Two sections of liver, injected, showing carcinoma and fungus haematodes. From a woman who had a cancerous mamma, she died of ascites and jaundice. Carcinoma, fungus haematodes, medullary sarcoma, and melanosis are often seen combined; sometimes accidentally with scrofula.

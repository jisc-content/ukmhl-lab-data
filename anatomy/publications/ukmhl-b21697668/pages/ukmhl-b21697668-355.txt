309 SECTION X. URINARY ORGANS. Kidneys.â€”Healthy and Morbid Anatomy. 1299 Two kidnies united by an isthmus ; a congenital mal- formation, commonly denominated " the horse- shoe kidney." The ureters and bladder shown. From a girl about 10 years of .age, who died of hydrocephalus acutus. 1300 A kidney, structure healthy; the capsule thickly co- vered with adipose substance. 1301 Section of a kidney beautifully injected. The capsula propria is reflected; it is slightly thick- ened. There are a great number of small serous cysts in the external and internal parts of the cor- tical substance. The man from whom this specimen was taken was killed suddenly by a horse. The other kidney was affected in a similar manner; his lungs contained some scrofulous tubercles. 1302 A kidney ; nearly the whole of its natural structure destroyed by the production of large serous cysts, not hydatids ; the other kidney presented the same morbid change. 1303 Section of a kidney injected. The kidney appeared very large ; nearly the whole of the cortical and medullary structure is converted into innumerable serous cysts, not hydatids. The other kidney was similarly affected. This is a beautiful specimen. The patient a woman, died of ascites, caused by a diseased liver. 1304 Section of a kidney. The capsule thickened ; there is a serous cyst on the external surface ; the papillas are shown. The kidneys were inflamed; the patient died from the effects of acute dropsy. 1305 A kidney of immense size, showing the effects of in- flammation of its substance produced by the impru- dent employment of tinctura lyttee.

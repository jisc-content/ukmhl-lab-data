V PREFACE. gate Street Medical School; and some few were purchased by Dr. Grant, of University College. Of all the preparations which I have collected, I have preserved a careful description, which extends to the history of the case, the medical treatment with its results, collateral circumstances of importance, and to the pathological appear- ances observed on the post-mortem examination. This history occupies ten thick folio volumes, and is too bulky for publication in entire. The present catalogue is a brief ab- stract of those volumes, and I fear that in some instances it may be urged against me, that still greater brevity might have been observed with advantage. In this, however, I must claim the indulgence of my readers, and beg of them to regard with clemency the interest with which a collector always views the circumstances attending upon his acqui- sitions. The arrangement of the subjects of the catalogue [ have left to my friend and old pupil, Mr. Erasmus Wilson, of the Middlesex Hospital, who, in addition to his other numerous avocations, has kindly undertaken to revise the proof sheets, and to superintend the work during its progress through the press. The order which he has pursued is physiological, and in two additional chapters, such preparations have been assembled under the designation of " Miscellaneous," as, from the great extent of the collection, and the limited space which my house affords, had escaped observation during the classification of the rest. 2, New Basinghall Street, October 1, 181-1.

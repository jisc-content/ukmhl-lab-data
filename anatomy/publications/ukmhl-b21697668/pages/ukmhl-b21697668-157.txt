117 There was a considerable quantity of water in the pericardium, and in both sides of the thorax. The patient was a man 50 years of age; the pulse was irregular, although there were not any of the causes to occasion interruption to the flow of blood, which are noticed when the mitral valves are constricted. 432 Arch of the aorta, with the internal coat partly ossified. 433 Aorta, the semilunar valves greatly thickened and shortened by bone. An engraving of this preparation is in Mr. Hodgson's Work on the Arteries and Veins. The patient, a man 31 years of age, had been troubled with cough and difficulty of breathing nearly a year; attended by palpitation of the heart, and irregular pulse ; succeeded by haemoptysis, which caused death. The pleurae on both sides of the chest adhered very firmly; one of the lobes of the lung on the left side was filled with coagulated blood (apoplexy) and there were about six ounces of water tinged with blood in the thorax. Half a pint of water tinged with blood was effused into the pericardium. The parietes of the left ventricle very thin, the structure soft, and cavity large; mitral valve normal. The liver appeared healthy, but of an enormous size and its blood vessels were loaded with dark colored blood. 434 Arch of the aorta, with the remains of the ductus arteriosus. 435 Arch of the aorta, the internal coat slightly thickened by coagulated lymph. There are five arteries given off from the transverse arch. The remains of the ductus arteriosus are shown. 436 Aorta immensely dilated, particularly at its origin, arch, and descending portion. The sigmoid valves and coronary arteries slightly ossi- fied ; the internal coat of the aorta, and vessels of the arch greatly thickened by dense cartilage and bone. The patient, a man 65 years of age, for up- wards of twelve months had symptoms denoting an aneurism of the aorta ; effusion into the chest super- vened, and he expired suddenly. There was a considerable quantity of serum in both

421 the preparation. A portion of the umbilical cord and its vessels shown, also the urinary bladder and urachus, hkewise the uterus. This is the most singular specimen of malformation I ever examined As the upper and lower extremities were not mal- formed, they were removed to give a better view of the deviation of Nature's laws in the different viscera. 9 Aâ„¢st remarkable specimen of malformed fetus 1 he mother of this child was delivered of twins the one I shall describe was still-born, the other was at the lull period of utero-gestation and alive There were scarcely any signs of cranium, except the base, and the two portions of the ossa petrosa belonging to the temporal bones. The brain and medulla spinalis were wanting, and all the external portions of the vertebras. There was also a complete want of mtegumental covering to the central line of the back in the situation where the vertebral column should have been, and this defective part was covered with a dark-colored delicate membrane which extended from the neck to the sacrum This defect I have often noticed in the malformed fetus where there was a want of brain and spinal marrow' and a deficiency of spinous processes throughout the whole vertebras. This membranous production was cut open, which showed it to be an imperfect theca vertebralis, and there were seen several small blood-vessels and minute nerves on its interaal surface, but their con- nection I was unable to trace From the shortness of the neck of this imperfect tcetus, it appeared that some of the cervical vertebra- were wanting. This fact I have noticed in several monstrous productions of a similar kind, which will be described The most singular malformation of parts was a diminutive and imperfect appearance ol fetal features, as eye-lids, nose, and mouth 1 he superior and inferior extremities of the body varied greatly in proportion, and natural arrangement On the right side, which was much smaller than the lett, the soft parts were removed, to show the osseous parts belonging to them. In the arm the os humeri was very diminutive, the

He was discharged from the Hospital, and sent to England; on his arrival he was admitted into Haslar Hospital, where he remained a considerable time, and was several times salivated, and was dis- charged from this Institution as incurable, and afterwards admitted into the Sick Ward of Cripplegate Workhouse.

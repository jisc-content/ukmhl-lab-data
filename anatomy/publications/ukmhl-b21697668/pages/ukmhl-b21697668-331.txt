285 The case and dissection is published in the 9th Volume of the Royal Medico-Chirurgical Transactions. 196 Liver affected with medullary sarcoma. From a man, 56 years of age. The liver was greatly enlarged by medullary tubera of considerable size, many of which presented ex- ternally. The lungs were also affected with the same disease. The preparation shows two of the tubera; in one the brain-like matter was pressed out to show the cellular texture, which is greatly thickened where the medullary matter had been deposited. 197 Liver affected with medullary sarcoma. The liver injected. Some of the brain-like matter was washed out to show the dense cellular texture in which it had been deposited. 198 A section of liver. The liver was of a very pale color, its surface thickly covered with organised lymph; its structure nearly filled with remarkably large tumors, composed of a very dense cellular texture, the cells were filled with a secretion like cream. The fluid was pressed out of one of the tumors, which has the appearance of a piece of sponge; this is seen in the preparation. The gall-bladder was empty. This specimen Was taken from a gentleman high in rank; he had ascites, and paracentesis had been performed. I have never seen a similar disease in the liver, but I have a tumor in my Museum which was extirpated, and which shows all the morbid structure seen in the tubercles of this liver ; the disease ultimately proved to be of a malignant nature ; it will be described in the history of Local Tumors. In Dr. Baillie's valuable Work on Morbid Anatomy, there is a description of what he has termed " a large white tubercle", which I think is like the tumors I have described. His description is not very satisfactory, for he thought it resembled the ordinary appearance of schirrus in other parts of the body, or that it was of a scrofulous nature ; these are very dissimilar morbid products, and are rarely seen combined. I have no doubt

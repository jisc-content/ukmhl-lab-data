Various plans of treatment were employed to improve her health, without effect; she slowly declined in strength, her sallow countenance denoted signs of organic disease in the liver, and this viscus was greatly enlarged. The abdomen increased, and she was subject to bilious vomiting and purging; these symptoms became more violent and frequent, and every attack was expected to prove fatal; their severity could only be moderated by large doses of opium. The liver acquired such a magnitude as to occupy nearly the whole of the abdomen, and great pain was complained of in both hypochondria. There was a sense of fluctuation, as if effusion had taken place into the abdomen, yet the function of the kidnies was not interrupted, nor was the urine high-colored. The abdomen became enormously enlarged, and she complained of great pain when slight pressure with the hand was made to examine the extent of the disease. About a year previous to her death, a more severe paroxysm of vomiting came on, succeeded by ex- cessive diarrhoea, which continued for three days, this reduced the abdomen surprisingly, and what was still more astonishing, an immense number of various sized hydatids were discharged with the faeces, which satisfactorily explained the nature of the disease to be the growths of hydatids in the liver, and showed that an opening of communication had heen establish- ed between this viscus and one of the intestines, by ulcerative absorption, &c. During this critical effort of nature, the constitutional powers of the patient were greatly diminished, so as to require, then, and for some time afterwards, a nourishing and sti- mulating plan of treatment. To the astonishment of all who saw her, she slowly improved in health, yet the liver was large. The hydatids were in a perfect state, and several dead ones were occasionally voided with the faeces ; at this period it was imagined that nature might effect a cure, but the distension of

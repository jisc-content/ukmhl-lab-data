140 SECTION VI. NERVOUS SYSTEM. The Brain and Spinal Cord—Normal Anatomy. 495 A portion of the inferior part of the medulla spinalis ; the cauda equina unravelled. 496 Cauda equina unravelled. Comparative Anatomy. 497 Anterior lobes of the brain of a monkey ; the commis sura mollis shown. 498 The brain, and a portion of the medulla spinalis of a cat. There are no middle lobes in this animal; the convolutions of the two hemispheres are large. The cerebellum is divided into four lobes, two lateral, and two central; which correspond with the quadran- gular cavities formed by the occipital bone, and bony tentorium. The corpora quadrigemina distinguish the brain of herbivorous from that of the carnivorous quadrupeds; the nates of the former exceeding considerably the size of the testes. The Brain and Spinal Cord—Morbid Anatomy. 499 Two portions of brain, with some of the arteries. From a man who died of sanguineous apoplexy. The membranes of the brain were thickened ; blood was found effused into the substance of both hemispheres. After removing the coagula, several small arteries which had been ruptured were seen ; and at their extremi-

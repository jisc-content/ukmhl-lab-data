The liver was remarkably large and granulated, its structure very dense, and the veins were gorged with blood ; but there were no signs of bile in the ducts, or pori biliarii. The gall-bladder was greatly thickened, it contained inspissated bile, resembling dried black currants, and the ductus cysticus and communis choledochus were obstructed by the same morbid secretion. The spleen was very large.

The gall-bladder was quite empty, the ductus cysticus, hepaticus and communis choledochus were perfectly healthy. The spleen was large, and firm in texture ; pancreas natural. The lungs and heart normal. The membranes of the

105 333 Part of the heart of a bullock. The whole weighed 9 pounds ; the average weight is 5 pounds. The serous covering of the heart, and the internal surface of the pericardium were immensely thickened by firmly adherent lymph. The arteries were re- markably large, as may be seen in the preparation. The heart was perfectly healthy in structure, there was a great accumulation of water in both sides of the chest; the lungs were natural. 334 The heart of a sheep, of an enormous size ; nearly as large as a small bullock's. Lymph had been depo- sited in great abundance in the bag of the pericar- dium and on its reflected portion, which had become organised ; the substance of the heart was inflamed. The pleuree on both sides of the chest were covered with coagulated lymph. The animal breathed with great difficulty for several months. 335 Heart of a young pig, showing the effects of chronic pericarditis. Lymph had been thickly deposited, and firm adhesion had been effected between the bag of the pericardium, and its reflected portion. 336 Heart of a kangaroo; the structure shown. The heart is very small considering the size of the animal; and the arteries belonging to the arch are also small. 337 Heart, eye, and the section of a kidney, from the myrmecophaga aculeata. 338 Heart of a seal. The arch of the aorta is always very large in this animal, and appears at its origin aneurismal. The ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale widely open. 339 Heart of a seal. The foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus widely open. I have examined a great number of seals, some of them full grown, and have invariably found the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus widely open. 340 Heart and lungs of a tortoise. The tongue and oesophagus are shown. 341 Heart and lungs of the boa constrictor. 342 Heart of a large squalus, or shark. The structure shown, also the numerous rows of valves of the aorta. 343 Heart of a shark, structure, and various valves shown. 344 Heart of a small shark.

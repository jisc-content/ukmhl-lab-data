374 tubercles of the fungoid character. There was a large tumor of the same kind on the spine, behind the viscera and the blood vessels. The vena cava was obliterated as far as the iliac veins. There were fungoid tubera in the liver, also in the lungs, &c. The history of this case is published in the 8th volume of the Royal Medico-Chirurgical Transactions. This is a very splendid prepara- tion. 1473 Testicle affected with fungus hcematodes. The growth is of an immense size, the tunica vaginalis and albuginea considerably thickened, and some parts firmly adherent.

This is a valuable specimen. 1474 Testicle affected with fungus hsematodes.

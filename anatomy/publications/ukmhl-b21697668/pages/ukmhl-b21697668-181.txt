139 ounces of water in the lateral ventricles; the mem- branes at the base of the brain were dense, and some of the arteries ossified. In Mr. Hodgson's Work on Aneurisms, an engraving of this aneurism is beautifully represented, and a description is given. 489 Arteries belonging to the base of the brain. The vertebral and basilar aneurismal; the coats of the anterior cerebral ossified. From an old man who died of apoplexy. 490 Plexus choroides, ossified; from an old subject. The arteries of the brain were also converted into bone, and their caliber greatly lessened. 491 A portion of carotid artery, healthy in structure ; a piece of dentist's twist was applied tightly around it, and afterwards removed; this shows the neat and clean manner in which the internal and fibrous coats have been divided, leaving the external or cellular, entire. 492 External carotid artery obliterated. 493 Veins of the uterus, with phlebolites within them. 494 Two phlebolites taken from an uterine vein.

371 matic cord, and the inguinal glands were affected with carcinoma. The tunics of the testicle were extremely dense in structure, and pus was found between them. This is a splendid specimen. 1461 Testicle carcinomatous, with destruction of the prin- cipal portions of its tunics, also of the integuments of part of the scrotum. The history of this case is not known. 1462 A testicle affected with genuine carcinoma, &c. The whole of the testis had been converted into carci- nomatous and medullary tumors, which had affected the absorbent glands of the spermatic cord, and the tunica vaginalis and albuginea were very much thickened; these appearances are exhibited in the preparation. The inguinal and lumbar absorbent glands were con- verted into medullary and carcinomatous tumors. The testicle was extirpated; the patient died twelve weeks after the operation. The disease in the tes- ticle had existed upwards of nine months, and his health became affected. The glands in the groin were not enlarged at the time the operation was performed. This preparation illustrates the existence of carcinoma and fungus haematodes in the same subject; they are frequently combined. 1463 A testicle affected with carcinoma. The natural structure completely destroyed; the tunica albuginea thickened. From a man 70 years of age. 1464 A testicle affected with carcinoma, the tunics are greatly thickened, and the disease had extended along the whole of the spermatic cord. The in- guinal glands were converted into cancerous tu- mors. 1465 Testicle affected with carcinoma. The tunica vaginalis and albuginea are greatly con- densed, and there is an adventitious membrane between these coats, which is shown in the prepara- tion. The inguinal glands were affected with the same disease. 1466 A section of a testis, which had been converted into medullary sarcoma, of great magnitude ; the tunica vaginalis and albuginea are greatly thickened, and

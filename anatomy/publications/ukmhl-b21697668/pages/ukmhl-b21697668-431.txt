385 1533 Extremity of the Fallopian tube, with two small serous cysts. 1534 Uterus natural in structure; there were pendulous serous cysts near the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tubes. 1535 Ovarium, and extremity of the Fallopian tube. From a woman who had never borne a child. Vesi- cles and signs of corpora lutea are seen ; the latter probably produced by excitement. Similar ap- pearances I have seen in the ovaria of virgins. 1536 Encysted ovarium. 1537 Uterus, vagina, and a portion of the bladder. The uterus and its cavity very small; the vagina in some parts ulcerated. There were serous cysts, and small dense tubercles in the left ovarium, and the right ovarium was changed into a large ab- scess. 1538 A section of an uterus, with pendulous serous cysts near the extremity of the Fallopian tube ; there was also a large cyst in the ovarium ; the os uteri obliterated. The patient was 50 years of age ; there was a gallon of fluid in the abdomen ; the liver granulated ; the peritoneum thickened by lymph and small tuber- cles, and all the intestines were agglutinated. The integuments were affected with purpura haamorr- hagica. 1539 Uterus, the right ovarium was immensely enlarged, its serous surface greatly thickened, and in some parts semi-cartilaginous ; firm adhesion had taken place between the ovarium and the posterior surface of the peritoneal covering of the uterus. On cutting open the diseased ovarium, it was found filled with a dense gelatinous secretion, mixed with coagulated lymph; the surfaces were thickly coated with organised lymph, and there were several solid substances like tumors, which seemed to be composed of the same substance. The Fallopian tubes, at their extremities, adhered firmly to the surface of the diseased ovary. The uterus did not appear to be diseased. The history of this case is not known. 1540 Uterus, with a diseased ovarium, &c. The uterus was very small ; the whole of the cervix

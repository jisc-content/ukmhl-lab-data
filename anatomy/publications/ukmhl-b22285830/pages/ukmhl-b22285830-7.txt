5 trhicli the germs of knowledge show no sign of present life, "no change of outer form, but in which their powers seem to be gathering strength, or in which they wait for more genial times, when elder sciences may be prepared to prop and train them. And this may well have been the case with surgery. But, though the history of the Professorship seemed thus barren, yet both its name and its records suggested many thoughts that appeared worthy to be pursued ; and chiefly this;—that, under all variety of circumstances, surgeons have recognised the propriety, or even the necessity, of asso- ■ciating their study with anatomy. They have done this, whatever may have been the form and range of the anatom- ical science they could pursue ; w'hether it were limited to the dissection -of a human body once in a year, and to the public delivery of six lectures thereupon ; or whether, with its present larger span, it would comprehend the structures of all the animated occupants of the earth in all its ages, and the laws observed in all; or, with microscopic sight, would search to the extreme boundary of visible organic form ; or, with the help of chemistry, would pass even this limit, and dissever the elemental atoms of the organism. It is surely worthy of thought, that however widely anatomy has ranged, surgeons have claimed it, at least in chief part, as their province; theirs for labour, for intellectual exercise and recreation; but, above all, as they have believed, theirs for the safety and promotion of their more proper calling. Now, to a certain point, the necessity of the combination of anatomy with surgery would be very evident. As the artificer should know well the construction of that which he undertakes to repair, so should the surgeon know every line and mark of the body whose damages he must set right, whose errors in form or function he must correct, whose members he may need to mutilate with safety. But this has been said a thousand times, and never has been gainsayed ; it was in the conviction of this truth that Arris, in his great desire for the promotion of chirurgery, founded a lecture- ship upon anatomy; this, therefore, can be no subject of discourse.

15 Sir Everard Home and Mr. Clift, none of his pupils professed to follow him in comparative anatomy or physiology ; but among his pupils were Cline, Astley Cooper, Abernethy, Blizard, Lynn,â€”all the great sur- geons of the last generation, all those who in their several schools taught surgery with the strength and clear- ness they had acquired in the study of the Hunterian phy- siology. So, too, in France : the genius of Bichat was effective, not in continuing a career of bold and glittering hypotheses in physiology, but in giving thought and well- directed energy to a great staff of surgeons, who in their time improved surgery in France under the influence of Bichat's mind, as those in England did under the guidanco of John Hunter. Even among ourselves, the chief places in surgery have been ever held by those who have been the chief students of anatomy. In every school every teacher observes the same among his pupils. And all this, I main- tain, is not because of the direct relation of utility between the two pursuits, but because the mind that will devote itself to science, and discipline itself in the school of truth, is that which can best profit by experience, and which is most apt in the promotion and daily practice of a calling such as ours. So that I repeat, if all those other advantages which I have mentioned, as accruing from the recent progress of anatomy, were fallacious, still this should be enough to show that the study of anatomy, in the comprehensive, laborious, and liberal spirit in which it is now pursued, will best instruct the mind for the promotion and the practice of surgery. The sum, then, ol the arguments that I would adduce in affirmation of my thesis, might be this ; that the recent pro- gress of anatomy has added many facts which are of direct and immediate advantage either in diagnosis or in the prac- tice of surgery; that, in addition to this, it lias illustrated many of those principles of surgery, upon which we must mainly depend for its future promotion, and for guidance in emergencies ; that, more than this, it has contributed facts improving every department alike of medicine and of surgery, facts upon which we must rely mainly for tlie elimination of soint of those thousand sources of fallacy which as yet obstruct our progress ; hut, most of all, I niain- c 2

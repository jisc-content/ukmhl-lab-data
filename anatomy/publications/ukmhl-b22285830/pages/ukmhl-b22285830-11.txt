9 these similar cells arranging themselves in a median line, assuming the character of cartilage-cells, and becoming pre- sently the rudimental vertebral column ; others will be, at the same time, arranging themselves in rows, and assuming the function, and then more gradually the structure, of muscles; others among the same cells will become integu- ment and epithelium; others will be assuming the form of blood-corpuscles, and these will be ranged in the order of future blood-vessels, and will wait for the propelling force of the heart, formed of cells that were like themselves. All this time no blood-vessels are present; there does not appear one of those things to which surgeons were in the habit of referring as the sources of the force by which such changes are accomplished. There is here nothing but a mass of cells with some interposed material; and each cell developes itself to its own destiny and end. So, too, if any one traces the gradual development of the lymph or chyle into blood, he wDl watch the same kind of changes; he will find them, either as an homogeneous fluid, or as one turbid with minute molecular particles, becoming the seats of development of solid bodies; and these will gradually assume the more complicated character of nucleated cells; and then each will gradually acquire colour till it becomes a perfect corpuscle of the blood. There is not to be traced any source for that directive as well as formative power which has been so commonly referred to in explaining the process of or- ganisation. In short, all that we can see, in processes like these, puts us back upon the intrinsic properties of the ma- terials themselves, for the explanation of the various mani- festations of the formative force which they display. The formative force, whatever be its origin, we must assume to be but one ; and the various manifestations in which it is displayed, we must, I think, after such microscopic watching of its eff ecu, refer to the variety of tlie materials in which it is exercised. And, if this be so, we are bound to discard, both from physiology and the study of disease, all sucli expres- sions as " action of the blood-vessels," and " action of absorbents;" we can no longer, with these truths before us, speak of arteries as builders, or of absorbents as modellers.

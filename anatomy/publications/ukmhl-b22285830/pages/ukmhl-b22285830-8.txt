6 But, while every age lias thus recognised the necessity of combining anatomy with surgery, so far as its immediate application in practice may be necessary, in every age also, —at least in these latter times,—the seniors in surgery have doubted whether the novel anatomical pursuits of their juniors could increase their fitness for practice. In every age it has been said, " You go too far." It is not enough to answer to the seniors of our own day, that the same objection was made to them when they, in earlier times, passed the bounds of recognised utility, and that the event has jiroved the objection wrong. For it must be admitted that modern anatomy has adopted not only new methods, but evennew objects, of research j it hasnotonly extended itself largely in its recognised territory, but much more has passed into wholly new fields of inquiry; and in the facts and laws which it has discovered, especially with the help of the miscroscope and chemistry and large compari- sons, however interesting they may be to the student of pure science, it may be doubted whether there be anything that can contribute at all to the advancement of surgery : so that there may be ground for asking, whether the study of modern anatomy,—of that, I mean, which is pursued with the microscope, with chemistry, and with enlarged compa- risons of lower forms and types of structure,— either has been, or is ever likely to become, useful to those who would be surgeons. Let the affirmative to this question be my thesis ; let it be my endeavour to prove that there are things in the recent progress of anatomy, which it behoves every student of surgery to learn, if he would either promote his art or prac- tise with success. I know it may be very difficult to adduce such cases as those who would hold the negative of this commonly ask for,—cases in which single facts, connected with the recent discoveries of anatomy, are at once and directly applicable to the promotion of surgical practice. However, there are some of these. The recognition, by the microscope, of the na- ture of tumouts, is at once applicable to practice, by the de- termination which it may give for or against operations, when

18 let us ever keep in view the utility of its applications.; for it is our singular privilege that we may, if we will, combine with the study of this science the practice of the most useful and benevolent of the arts; an art in which, when rightly exercised, when cleared from all avarice, alike of reputation and of wealth, there is nothing that any mind, however scrupulous, can detect which is degrading to the purest or most divine sentiments to which our nature can attain. Then, while by our utility we gain men's favourable opinion, let our science help, by her excellent beauty, to purify so- ciety from all that is shallow, unreal, or insincere; let her promote that true wealth of nations which is reckoned, not by arms, nor by diplomacy, nor by gold, but by wisdom, by generosity, by pure morals. Above all, let our science render homage to that Christian doctrine by which herself is purified; for its true guidance, let her show loving obedience; let her teach, by the example of our unchanging love for truth, that truth is in itself, and for its own sake, excellent, â€”a Paradise for the intellectual soul; so, through the paths of obedience and truth, our science shall guide men to the adoration of the Truth Himself.

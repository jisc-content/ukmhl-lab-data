10 All these are but the apparatus by which the materials, so to speak, in their raw state, may be carried to and fro in parts that are themselves forming. Neither can we speak of the materials for organisation as being merely plastic and passive, as so much clay to be moulded by some external force. We can only speak of them as being self-organising, autoplastic, working with a force which, whencesoever it is derived, is efficient in themselves. The suggestion, which we derive from microscopic examin- ation, of the relation existing between the forms that are assumed and the previous composition of the materials that assume them, may indicate the true connexion between the minute anatomy and the minuter chemistry of disease, and may be followed out in some facts which have a direct bearing on the expressions we use concerning the constitu- tional origin of local diseases. It may be proved, for ex- ample, that an excretory organ will grow, actually grow, and increase both the bulk and weight of its substance, in direct proportion to the quantity of materials which it will be its office to excrete from the blood. For example, a lung or a kidney will so grow according to the quantities of the materials they are to excrete ; and it may be proved, at least of one of these, that the materials for excretion are present already formed in the blood, and are present before the increase of the organ by which they are to be excreted. From several such instances and probable analogies, it may be deduced as a general rule, especially for excretory organs, that their formation is consequent upon the formation in the blood of the materials which it will be their office to excrete. The same may be proved also of many abnormal struc- tures. The virus, for example, of the small-pox present in the blood induces, as a consequence, the formation of those morbid structures by which itself may be excreted; it is in- corporated in the pustules, and the blood is freed from it. So, in the case of vaccinia and other morbid poisons of the same kind, the series of events is, the existence of morbid materials in the blood, the consequent formation of organic structures ill which they are incoi-porated, and thence the clearing of

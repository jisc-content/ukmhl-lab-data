8 by tlie researches of minute anatomyj it has never been proved. Minute anatomy has, however, proved it by find- ing that all the structures) natural or morbid, are conformed to certain definite laws of development. After tracing, with minute inquiry, the development of the natural structures, it has found that, however diverse from them the outward form of any morbid growth maybe, it was in its earliest con- ditions, and is, in its elemental structures, like them, or not wholly dissimilar from them ; and that in its development it may have passed through stages comparable with each phase of the development of the natural parts. We cannot over- estimate the value of a principle like this. Unless it had been proved, I do not know that we could liave had the right, in any case, to assume what has been the progress of a morbid structure, when we find it in only one phase of its existence. But now, in whatever period we find a morbid growth, we may assume the previous stages and methods of its existence, knowing, by microscopic proof, that its deve- lopment must have been conformed to the laws which prevail in the development of normal growths. Then, with regard to the method of organisation or forma- tion of morbid structures, some idea of which must be pre- sent in our minds, in the consideration of nearly every case that appears before usbefore the development of cells was watched, it needed to be assumed that some- thing external to the forming mass controlled and directed it; something, that is, external to the mate- rials which were assuming shape, was supposed to be not only supplying or exciting a vital force in them, but even directing it and determining its mode and end. But, let any one examine such a process as that of the develop- ment of an ovum, and see there whether the appearance be not much rather like that of spontaneous changeâ€”a change worked out by a force which, whencesoever it be derived, is inherent and efficient in the materials themselves. He will find the whole mass of the ovum, or at least the focus of its activity, composed of cells; and these may be, to the sight, nearly alike, although the event proves that they have different properties. As he watches, he will see some among

11 the blood from them and their influence. We may trace the same general phenomena in other cases, in which we cannot have the test of inoculation as a proof that the materials, which were present in the blood, are incorporated in the new-formed morbid structure. But while the general phenomena are the same, we may be sure, from the close- ness of the analogy, that a similar series of events has oc- curred ; so that, as a general rule, it may be stated, that morbid materials present in the blood are naturally prone to lead to the construction of certain morbid structures, in which themselves may be incorporated. And as with normal structures so with these ; the morbid structures, incorporating the materials from the blood, have each a special form. The elemental forms, indeed,—the cells and nuclei, and the rest,—may not be always capable of distinc- tion ; but the general forms into which they are constructed are in each case peculiar. Thus, guided by what microscopic anatomy has discerned, and, in some measure, by what organic chemistry has sug- gested, we seem to be able to prove as principles for surgery, that the formation of morbid structures is, in a large class of cases, a process of organisation analogous in its method with that of the natural structures ; that the materials compos- ing them are, in the ordinary conditions of life, autoplastic, and are transferred from the blood into them ; and that the form of morbid structure which is assumed is determined by the composition of the morbid materials, although, doubtless, its characters may be, in some measure, modified by the manifold circumstances in which the materials are placed. Now, I might pass on to mention many other cases of the same kind, in which we seem to have attained to truer principles, or, at least, to clearer expressions of the principles of surgery; but in a temperature like this, some will have already asked, " What of all this? If all this be true, will it improve surgery?" To which I can only answer, If it will not, then all the teaching has been vain which we have heard for so many years, of the constitutional origin and nature oflocal diseases—all, at least, of that teaching which has not been a matter of vague rule for giving physic,—all

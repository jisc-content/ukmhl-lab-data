13 to admit that minute anatomy, and the other means to which we may now have recourse, have been eminently useful. It would be impossible, indeed, to name a department of medi- cine or surgery to which the recent studies of anatomy have not contributed, at least, useful facts. The pathology of inflammation, the repair of injuries, the production and development of morbid growths, the whole of that vast field upon which medicine and surgery meet and mutually illus- trate one another; all these have been illustrated by direct observations with the modern methods of research ; and besides all these, one may safely state that the pathology of every tissue and organ of the body has been improved by our better knowledge of its natural structure, â€”a knowledge which could be obtained only by the methods of research which have been of late employed. We cannot, I think, in these times, hope to improve very much the practice of our predecessors, unless we adopt methods different from those which they have employed, and methods better than theirs. For years, the acutest intellects have been employed, with consummate industry and abun- dant opportunity, in endeavouring to determine some things of the most urgent interest in our art, but in vain; in vain, not for lack of abihty which we can hope to possess, but for lack of those means of which many are now in our power. If we would hope to advance surgery, it can only be by adding the facts which we may obtain by these means to those which our predecessors have accumulated. It would not be difficult to point out a large number of cases in which we may well hope for progress by these means. In regard to such a disease as cancer, for example, we want to know the proportion of cases in which cancer returns after operation, the average time that a patient lives upon whom no operation is performed, the average age, end all other circumstances connected with the disease; and I would venture to say, that whole volumes of statistics as yet recwded upon the matter, nay, that almost every statistical table yet printed is simply and wholly valueless for these purposes, and valueless, chiefly because of the non-use of thos*? means by which alone we can detect what is and what

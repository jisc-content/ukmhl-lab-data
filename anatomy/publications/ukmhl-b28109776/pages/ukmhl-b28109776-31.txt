THE LIMBS 21 through the joint to the bottom of the cup, or acetabulum^ of the pelvis. The knee-joint is a hinge-joint in function, though its form is peculiar. The femur has two articular surfaces which meet in front and are continued a little way up the bone. The corresponding surfaces of the tibia are only slightly concave, but are deepened on their outer edges by rims of cartilage, the semilunar cartilage. The articular surfaces of the femur roll backwards and forwards on those of the tibia. The movement at the knee-joint is limited by the patella and by special ligaments. Between the latter and the patella are masses of fat, which serve as pads to the knee. The bones of the foot form in a double sense an elastic spring, which acts in both the transverse and longitudinal directions. The foot, when suspended, is therefore shorter and narrower than when the weight of the body rests on it. On the upper side of this elastic arch is the flat ball-and- socket ankle-joint (Fig. 13, g). The foot rests on the ground in three places—the heel, the ball of the great toe, and that of the little toe. The same remarks apply to the joints of the foot as to those of the hand, except that the great toe is attached to the foot by a hinge-joint—not, like the thumb to the hand, by a ball-and-socket joint. It is therefore capable of no other movements than are the rest of the toes, and cannot be opposed to them so as to grasp an object. This absence of prehensible power and of general mobility such as is possessed by the hand, is associated with the greater degree of firmness required by the feet to enable them alone to Support the weight of the body ; in other words, it is associated with the upright position of man.

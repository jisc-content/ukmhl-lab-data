91 THE LARYNX the inner side of the thyroid cartilage, near the median line, one pair about halfway up, the other slightly higher. The former folds, stifFened by elastic fibres, pass back- ward, diverging from one another to the arytenoid carti- lages. These are called the vocal cords (Fig. 31, d). The other pair, the so-called false vocal cords (Fig. 31, b\ are attached also to the arytenoid cartilages, a little above and to the side of the vocal cords. The space between the edges of the vocal cords is called the glottis (Fig. 31, c). In breathing, the glottis is wide open (Fig. 31, L, e\ By contraction of the various muscles Stretching between Fig. 31.â€”Larynx (viewed from above) : I., in Breathing (glottis open) ; II., IN Speaking (glottis narrowed). a, vocal cords ; b, false vocal cords ; r, glottis ; epiglottis. the cartilages, these, and hence also the vocal cords, are moved, approximated, or separated. This occurs normally in voice- production, abnormally by the irritant effect of various gases, such as chlorine, coal-gas, etc., on the mucous membrane of the larynx. Such gases effect a spasmodic closure of the glottis, and so are hindered from reaching the lungs. The vocal cords are the essential organs for the produc- tion of the voice. The false vocal cords have no share in it. The vocal cords are, by the contraction of the special muscles attached between the cartilages, subject to three forms of movement : (i) by the rotation of the arytenoid cartilages on their longitudinal axes, the edges

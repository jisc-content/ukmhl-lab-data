CARE OF THE BODY 140 The brain, the seat of intellect and will, which receives all the impressions of the senses and, with the spinal cord, occasions movements, may, like other organs, suffer from over-exertion. Especial care ought to be taken to inure it gradually to an increased activity, and to secure, in children, the right proportion between work and rest. In many cases it is quite sufficient to change the kind of intellectual activity, but the alternation of bodily and intellectual work has a still better effect. Sufficient sleep is indispensable to persons engaged in hard brain-work. Children and weakly, especially anaemic, adults require more sleep, but for adults in general, seven to eight hours are sufficient. The need of sleep is less with bodily than with mental work. Besides over-exertion, the brain may be injured by violent emotions, troubles, or passion, over-strong impressions of the senses, abuse of spirits or other stimulants, shocks, and extreme degrees of temperature. Especially during the years of growth, such injurious influences may have the worst consequences. Children should therefore be guarded with the most anxious care against all such evlls. At the first Symptoms of brain- and nerve-exhaustion (neurasthesia), it is time to change the mode of life. Only by so doing can the spread of this disease, the commonest of our day, be checked. If a family show an heredltary tendency to any serious nervous affection, hysterla, epilepsy, or other mental dls- turbances, care must be taken, in the educatlon of the children, to keep them from all violent excitement, and to restrain the development of mental activity, whilst encouraging, as far as possible, a strong and healthy physical development.

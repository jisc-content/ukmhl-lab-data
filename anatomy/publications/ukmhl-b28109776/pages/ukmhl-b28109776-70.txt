IV, Metabolism The activities of the body are accompanied by destruction i of its substance. New supplies have to make good this i loss, and also to provide for growth. The raw material whence these supplies are derived is called the food. The conversion of this raw material into substances which can be taken up by the living cells is termed the process of i nutrition. Nutrition, in its widest sense, includes the digestive processes which go on in the alimentary canal ; the distribution of the products of digestion by the blood ; the further work of distribution carried on by means of the lymphatic System, whereby the requisite substances are brought to the individual cells ; and finally the absorption of the substances by the cells, and their subsequent build- ing-up by the living substance (protoplasm) into fresh protoplasm. The destruction above referred to is the out- come of respiration, and consists ultimately in the decom- position of protoplasm. This decomposition is associated with the presence of oxygen in the cells, brought thither from the lungs by the blood and lymph streams. The r products of this decomposition leave the cells by the samel streams, and ultimately pass out from the body in expired B air, in urine, and in small part in perspiration. The com-| plete and complicated series of changes, whereby new pro- toplasm is constructed from the raw materials, and whereby this living substance is decomposed, is conveniently termed metabolism. The process of digestion is mainly one of solution. The solid constituents of the food-substances are acted on by various Juicesâ€”salivary, gastric, pancreatic, and other. As 6o

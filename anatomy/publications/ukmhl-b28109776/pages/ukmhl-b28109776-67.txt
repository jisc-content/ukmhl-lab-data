TASTE 57 Many poisonous gases, coal-gas which has passed through the soil and so left behind its odoriferous constituents, and also carbon dioxide, though poisonous, are quite without smell. On the other hand, some strong-smelling gases are innocuous. However, numerous dusty particles and many bacteria, intercepted by the moist mucous membrane of the nose, are hindered from passing with the inhaled air to the lungs. 4. Taste,—^The organs of the Sensation of taste are located in the mucous membrane of the tongue and palate. The main mass of the tongue is muscular. Its muscle- fibres run in the most various directions, so that it possesses an extraordinary mobility. The muscle-fibres have their origin on the h'^oid bone and lower jaw, and are inserted below the mucous membrane of the tongue itself. The mucous membrane is smooth on the under side, but roughened on the upper side by various prominences, the ‘papillce. In these are placed special groups of cells, the Organs of taste, to which run the nerves of taste, the ninth and sensory part of the fifth cranial nerves. From the bottom of the mouth springs a fold of its mucous membrane, which is attached to the median line of the tongue on its lower surface, and which prevents the tongue from being drawn too far back or turned com- pletely over. A necessary condition for tasting is that the substance to be tasted should be a liquid, or soluble in the saliva, and so be brought closely in contact with the taste-organs. Solid bodies which are not dissolved in the saliva do not taste. Taste-sensations, like those of smell, are of little value in determining whether the substances which call them forth are injurious or no. It is worth noting that our language has no words at all to accurately designate olfactory sensations, and only four for taste-sensations—“ sweet,” “ sour,” “ bitter,” and “ salt.” Smell- and taste-sensations often co-operate, and are also

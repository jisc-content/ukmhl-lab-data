THE LIMBS *9 The arrangement of the bones of the leg corresponds with that of the arm-bones. Its three divisions are the thigh, the lower leg, and the foot. The femur, or thigh-bone, is a strong, cylindrical bone, much thicker at the ends than in the middle. Its upper end bears, as a lateral process, the articulation for the hip- joint ; its lower end, that for the knee-joint. The large heads of such bones as the femur aftbrd large Fig. II.—Longitudinal Sec- TION THROUGH THE UpPER EnD OF THE Femur.

The lower leg, like the lower arm, consists of two bones— the stronger iibia, or shin-bone, and the fibula^ or splint-bone, a smaller bone which lies along the outer side of the leg. At the upper end of the tibia, in the front of the knee-joint, is a small bone, the patella. It is nearly circular, flat on

III. The Nervous System 28 {a) The Brain.—T he group of Organs of which the nervous System consists are—the brain, the spinal cord, and the nerves, with their nerve-endings. The central nervous System, consisting of the brain and spinal cord, is the seat of consciousness, Sensation, and will. It receives and gives out nervous Impulses. The Impulses which it receives result from Stimulation of nerve-endings ; for instance, those of the Organs of special sense, sight, etc. Such Impulses, travelling to the brain {afferent impulses), frequently give rise to sensations. As a consequence of changes set up in its nervous substance by afferent impulses, or on the initiative of the will, efferent impulses proceed from the brain along other nerve-fibres {eferent nerves') to the muscles, which they set in movement, and to other structures, such as . glands, whose secretions they control. Because afferent impulses frequently give rise to sensa- tions, the nerves along which they pass {afferent nerves) are sometimes called sensory nerves; and because the principal effect of efferent impulses is to produce movement, the nerves conducting them are sometimes called motor nerves. Afferent impulses may produce an effect, although they fall to give rise to a Sensation. Failing to reach the thres- hold of consciousness, they may stir up the spinal cord or parts of the brain to activity ; the resulting movements in such cases are termed reflex actions. The brain is enclosed in three membranes. The outer- most, the dura-mater, is a tough membrane lying dose against the inside of the skull, and sending several flattened folds between the different parts of the brain. The inner- most membrane, the pia-mater, is soft and vascular, and forms a dellcate Investment to the brain itself, whose contours

METABOLISM 74 In drawing a deep breath, about 3500 c.mms. of air | pass into the lungs. In even the deepest expiration they ; are not quite emptied, about 1600 to 1500 c.mms. of air i always remaining in them. The sum of these numbers, ^ about 5000 c.mms., gives the cubic contents of the lungs. ; In quiet breathing a volume of air equal to about a quarter 1 of the contents of the lungs passes in and out. The number f of respirations is about 14 to 17 per minute. The : respiratory movements take place, as a rule, without the i co-operation of the subject, but are not so involuntary but | that a person can cease breathing for a short time, or ) breathe faster or slower. Heavy muscular exertion and ^ emotional excitement accelerate the respiratory movements. | In the cavities of the mouth and nose the air is warmed ^ and partially cleaned from dust, which adheres to their ^ moist surfaces. , The blood flowing through the caplllarles which run 1 in the walls of the alveoli of the lungs, has just previously . made the circuit of the body, and has returned through the t right auricle as dark-red venous blood, devoid of oxygen, but rieh in carbon dioxide. Passinginto the right ventricle, 1: it is carried to the lungs by the pulmonary artery. Flowing li through the capillaries of the lungs, its carbon dioxide is 1 glven up, and the haemoglobin of the red corpuscles takes up oxygen, so that this blood, when it passes by the pul- ; monary veins to the left auricle, is bright-red arterial blood, r prepared again to carry on the work of oxygen-distribution | and carbon dioxide-collection. : j The extent of this gaseous exchange between blood and ti air is best gauged by comparing the compositions of ordinary i and of expired air. Atmospheric air consists, in 10,000 t: parts by volume, apart from a very variable quantity of aqueous vapour, of— 7901 parts nitrogen per 10,000. ! 2095 „ oxygen ^ „ 4 ,, carbonic acid „ j 1

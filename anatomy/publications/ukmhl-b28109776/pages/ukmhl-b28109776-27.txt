17 THE LIMBS which Stretches in front from the ulna to the humerus This arrangement is one of the essential conditions for the firmness of the arm. The hand itself consists of three groups of bones. The carpals, or wrist-bones (Fig. IO, d), form two transverse rows, each of four short thick bones; the metacarpals (Fig. IO, e\ or bones of the hand, five in number ; and the bones of the fingers, phalanges (Fig. IO,/), of which there are three in each länger and two in the thumb. The arm has three great joints—shoulder, elbow, and wrist, differing from one an- other both in form and func- tion. The shoulder-joint is a ball-and-socket joint, and, as such, allows the arm to move in various planes as well as round its own axis. The elbozv-joint, between the humerus above and the radius and ulna below, is a hinge-joint, in which the lower 3rm extends itself and bends downward, swinging in one plane only through an angle of nearly 180°. The form of the joint and the check arrange- ments, the bony process and ligament, limit the movements ot ^e lower arm, the former in direciion, the latter in extent. 1 ne articulation of the radius at the elbow is such that Fig. 10.—The Bones of the Right Arm : I., in Supina- tion (pALM upward) ; II., in Pronation (palm downward). fl, humerus 5 ulna 5 c, radius 5 dj carpal bones ; e, metacar- pals ; /, phalanges.

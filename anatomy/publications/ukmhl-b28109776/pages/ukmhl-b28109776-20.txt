THE SKELETON IO The occipital bone (Fig. 6, c) forms the hind wall of thc skull, and, together with the sphenoid and parts of the tem- poral bones (Fig. 6, d)^ its base. In front of the sphenoid, in the middle line and immediately behind the nasal cavity, is placed the ethmoid bone, through whose numerous small openings the branches of the olfactory nerves enter the nasal cavity. On either side of the cranium, the temporal bones unite with the occipital bone. From each temporal bone an inwardly directed process arises which forms a bony Sup- port to the internal ear of that side ; externally also a thin process runs forward and unites with a backwardly directed process of the cheek-bone (Fig. 6, to form a thin arch of bone, the zygomatic arch. Passing from the lower side of this arch to the lower jaw are the muscles which are con- cerned in mastica- tion. Thebone closes the brain-case in front (Fig. 6, a\ and the two almost regularly quadrilateral parietal bones (Fig^ 6, b) dose it above and at the sides. d he skull-cavity which these bones enclose is so com- pletely filled by the brain, that the channels of the blood- vessels run in flat grooves on the inner surfaces of the bones. In the occipital bone is an opening, the occipital foramen through which the brain passes, to be continued in the spinal canal as the spinal cord.

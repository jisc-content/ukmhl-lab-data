4!) SICHT objects of known size, observation of distances, inform us of their actual size. At too small a visual angle, objects either too minute or too far off are no longer distinguish- able. This is the case when the visual angle is less than about 1°. Artificial aids can enlarge it. In the case of minute objects this is done by the microscope ; in that of distant objects by the telescope. Impressions of size, amongst other phenomena, assist the judgment in estimating the distance of an object. An important influence is exercised by the degree of accom- ;modation ; for the effort in accommodating the eye is the •greater the nearer the object. The estimation of length and distance is an activity of the muscular sense ; while we let our eye pass over the •iength to be estimated, the amount of muscular exertion .necessary gives the notion of the magnitude in question. The duration of a light-stimulus need only be very short :o produce a Sensation of light; thus the electric spark, jiasting not quite ^ second, gives the Sensation bf a flash of light. Very strong impressions of light, and therefore im- pressions of great brightness, produce peculiar contrast "ffects, called after-'mages. A glance at the sun produces ihe appearance of an image of the sun, lasting about a ninute and continually changing its colour. A long and :teady gaze at the bright sky through a window produces fn after-image, in which the dark window-frame appears äght, and the bright sky dark. To the phenomenon of after-images are due many optical iffects and illusions. Thus a stick, whose end is glowing, rives, when rapidly flourished, the appearance of lines of Pght ; telegraph-wires seen from the window of a rapidly noving train appear to rise up and down in wave-like aotion ; the kinematoscope owes its effect also to after- 'mages. Another optical Illusion consists in the fact that ght objects on a dark ground look larger, dark objects a light ground look smaller than they really are. A

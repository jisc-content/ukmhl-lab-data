128 SPECIAL HYGIENIC RULES Especially endangered are all workmen who are forced to breathe stone-dust, as masons and stone-cutters, porcelain- workers, cutlers, jewellers, glaziers, and Colliers. With all these, particles of stone, glass, iron, or coal are deposited in the lungs in considerable quantities. Legislation has not yet done nearly enough to provide against these dangers. Such industries as cuttling and glass-cutting, in which, as they are now carried on, but few workers live to the age of forty, have no claim to protection or consideration. For the rest, the dangers from dust may be, to a certain extent, diminished by various arrangements. The production of dust may, in some cases, be pre- vented by wetting the material. The deposited dust may be got rid of by frequent washing. Good Ventilation, supported, if necessary, by powerful exhausters, removes dust from workshops. If the dust can neither be avoided nor removed, the workmen might, in time, be induced to wear respirators. Work which produces dust should not be always com- mitted to the same set of men. Workmen ascertained to be suffering from tuberculosis ought—in Order to prevent infection—never to be admitted to such Works. (f) The Neighbourhood of Factories.—Many in- dustries not only injure the workers engaged in th^, but pollute the neighbourhood. Tanneries, soap-works, and glue-works, develop bad smells ; the waste water from sugar-refineries and breweries produces evil results, through the Wholesale development of bacteria. Rag and leather Works have sometimes even occasioned infectious disease among the neighbouring population. Many other in- dustries are nuisances on account of the noise and smoke. It is only fair that, when such works are being opened for the first time, their location at a distance from inhabited places should be insisted on, and that already existing

THE LARYNX 94 3. Resonanis {nasals), if the air partly or wholly passes out through the nose, and the voice is heard at the same time. 4. Vibrants, if the tongue vibrates rapidly. Our written alphabet is a very imperfect means of repre- senting the extraordinary number and variety of the sounds of the spoken words. Though in some cases there are several signs for one sound, yet in general the number of sounds is much greater than that of letters, so that several sounds have to be represented by one sign—as e.g. the different sounds of / and 0. Some composite sounds are also incorrectly rendered. TABLE I. Division of Consonants. Labial. Dental. Palatal.

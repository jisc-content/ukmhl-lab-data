Carbon dioxide in large quantities is poisonous. Its accumulation in the atmosphere is prevented by the green parts of plants. These, in the presence of sunlight, decom- pose it, give olf the oxygen, and unite the carbon with the hydrogen and oxygen to form starch or sugar. The carbon dioxide contained in the air of insufficiently- ventilated rooms often reaches twice or three times the normal quantity. In cellars, where fermentations due to the activity of micro-organisms are going on, it may rise to 5 or IO per cent. In such quantities it becomes a very real source of danger. The amount of aqueous vapour which the air can contain depends on the temperature. The following are the maxi- mum quantities which air at the temperatures mentioned can hold per looo litres (= 1,000,000 c.cs.)— At — 20° C. 1*06 grams, or of the total weight. The water contained in the air only attains its maximum out of doors when there is rain, snow, fog, or dew ; at other times the quantity is considerably less. In houses the air is often extraordinarily dry, especially if artificial heat is used, Very dry air is harmless to the lungs, if it only be pure ; but an excess of dryness in one’s dwelling is not desirable, as it seriously increases the danger of dust-formation. Too much dampness is not in the long run favourable to health, not only because, being a better conductor of heat than dry air, it tends to produce a too- rapid cooling of the body, but also because it favours the multiplication of micro-organisms. Air often contains various injurious substances. Those of more accidental or local kinds, gases, such as sulphuric acid, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, coal-gas, are too often the +1

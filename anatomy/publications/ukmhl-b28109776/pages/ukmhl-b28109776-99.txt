Vil. The Larynx ■^-c- e.-V- <Lt- The larynx (Fig. 29), the organ of voice, forms the upper end of the trachea. Covered in front by the skin of the neck, it is suspended from the hyoid bone (Fig. 29,/'), and em- bedded between the muscles of the neck. Following on the upper- most C-shaped cartilage of the trachea is a complete loop of car- tilage, the cricoid (Fig. 29, b). It is somewhat like a signet-ring in shape, being about twice as high on one side (the back) as on the other. Situated above the cricoid carti- lage, forming the hard “lump” in the throat, is a wedge-shaped car- tilage, the thyroid (Fig. 29, r). The apex of the wedge is directed for- wards, and lies in the median line ; its free edges send out processes above and below. The lower pro- cesses articulate with the cricoid, on which, in consequence, the thyroid is movable ; the upper processes are attached to. the hyoid bone. Articulating with the cricoid cartilage at the back are the two arytenoid cartilages (Fig. 29, d). Fach arytenoid is somewhat like a three-sided pyramid in shape, and so disposed that the apex is upwards, and that one surfice is 89 Fig. 29.—The Larynx (seen from behind). <?, trachea ; b, cricoid cartilage ; c, thy- roid cartilage ; d, arytenoid cartilage ; e, Santorini’s cartilage ; f, hyoid bone ; g, epiglottis.

67 THE BLOOD-VESSELS In addition to this comparatively small vessel, eight others originate or end in the heart. From the left ventricle Starts the aorta (Fig. 27,^), passing in a great curve backward and downward in front of the vertebral column, and at its curvature giving off the vessels for the head, neck, and arms. On its downward course it gives off branches to the organs of the thorax and abdomen, and, dividing, passes to the legs. From the right ventricle springs the pulmonary artery (Fig. 27, h)y which soon divides into two branches, one for each lung. The two venae cavae (Fig. 27,/*) open into the back of the right auricle. Of these, the superior vena cava receives blood from the head, neck, and arms ; and the inferior from the rest of the body. Lastly, four vessels, the pulmonary veins^ bring the blood from the lungs to the left auricle, two coming from the right, and two from the left lung. The blood of the abdominal viscera takes a peculiar course (Fig. 27, /, «, m). It comes from the descending brauch of the aorta. From the capillaries of the stomach, intestine, and spieen, it first collects in a stout vessel, the portal vein (Fig. 27, «), which enters the liver, and there again resolves itself into a capillary network. The liver also receives arterial blood direct from the aorta by the hepatic artery. The hepatic vein collects all the blood brought to the liver, and carries it to the inferior vena cava. This course taken by the blood from the abdominal viscera through a second set of capillaries is sometimes re- ferred to as the portal circulation. The circulation is regulated to suit the local and general needs of the body by the central nervous System. This regulation is twofold, the nervous System acting both on the central organ of circulation, the heart, and on the peripheral organs, the small blood-vessels. The former control has already been referred to (p. 28). That of the I small blood-vessels is by nervous impulses travelling along

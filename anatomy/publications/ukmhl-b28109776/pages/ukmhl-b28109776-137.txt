127 TRADES Mercurial poisoning is rife among workers in quick- silver-mines, as well as in all trades which have to do with quicksilver. As the mischief is done by the inhala- tion of mercurial vapours, large and well-ventilated Work- shops, short hours of work, and strict medical supervision, can protect the workers in some degree against serious injury to health. Chronic phosphorus-poisoning, which shows itself in the decay of the jaw-bone, arises in the manufacture of phospho- rous matches, which ought to be entirely prohibited. No workers with defective teeth ought to be employed at all in this trade. Arsenical poisoning occurs in the arsenic-mines, and in the manufacture of arsenical dyes and coloured paper made therewith. Injuries from irritant and poisonous gases occur in the manufacture of soda, from sulphuric acid gas, in gasworks ; from ammonia; in bleaching works, from chlorine and sulphurous acid gas. Such gases ought at once to be con- ducted away from the places where they are produced. In such trades as pottery-manufacture, which, as it has been carried on in this country tili quite recently, has been a fearful source of disease to the workers, it has been necessary for the State to interfere and show the employers that it is possible to substitute, for the deleterious articles obstinately employed, quite harmless material. In all the dangerous trades, the health of the workers is protected, as far as possible, by precise legislative enact- ments. The carrying out of these, and all other hygienic rules, is supervised by special inspectors. 2. Injuries from Dust.â€”The most frequent of all injuries is that caused by the inhalation of dust. Dust- formation is inseparable from the carrying on of most industries. Continued inhalation of dust occasions catarrh of the bronchial tubes and chronic inflammation of the luiigs, which are thus prepared for the bacilli of tuberculosis.

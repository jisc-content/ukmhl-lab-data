THE MUSCLES 23 Insertion. Though generally the eft'ect of the contraction of a muscle is to draw the insertion and the parts to which it is attached nearer the origin, yet there are some muscles which can work both ways. For exaraple, the muscles of the jaw, as a rule, move the lower jaw ; but when the chin is supported, they can be made to raise the head. In most muscles the fibres, running parallel to one another, give the appearance of longitudinal striation : for example, the flexor and extensor muscles of the arm of muscle-fibres. (Fig. I 5, <7, b'). In such muscles the tendons occur only at the ends, and the muscle consists of a comparatively small number of long fibres. In another kind, a tendon runs through the muscle from origin to insertion, and the fibres are attached obliquely to it and to the outer sheath of connective tissue. Muscles of this kind {e.g. of the calf) contain a large number of short fibres (Fig. 14). Generally speaking, the formet kind are adapted to the carriage of light weights over long distances ; the latter, to the lifting

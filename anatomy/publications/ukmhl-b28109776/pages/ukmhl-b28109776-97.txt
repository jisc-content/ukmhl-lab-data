87 VI. The Temperature of the Body The temperature of the blood of man, as of warm-blooded animals in general, is, within very narrow limits, constant. But there exist, owing to diifering thicknesses of the skin, considerable differences of temperature between one part of the body and another. The lowest temperature is registered when the thermometer is put on the sole of the foot (32*3° C.) ; the highest when placed in thearm-pit (37° C.). Any considerable Variation of the temperature of the blood is a dangerous Symptom, and indicative of disease. There must therefore, in health, be a balance struck between the gain of heat to the body and the loss of heat from the body. As in all such cases, the nervous System is arbitrator. By keeping a hand on both these processes, it maintains the temperature constant. The sources of heat to the body are physical and chemical. The energy by which all the work of the body is done is resolved into heat: these constitute the physical sources. The Chemical sources lie, as may be inferred firom what has been already said, in the oxidation processes due to the interaction between oxygen and the living substances of the cells. Thus, when a muscle contracts, chemical decomposi- tions occur, and the energy resulting makes its appearance sooner or later as heat. But in response to the needs of the body, the central nervous System can stir up similar activities in the liver and other “ heat-centres,” so that more heat is produced than would have been the case had the Organs been merely concerned in their routine work. In face of an emergency, reserves of heat may be called out. In addition, the skin may be fortified against too great

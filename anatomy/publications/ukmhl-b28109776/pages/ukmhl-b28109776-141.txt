131 INFECTION The dcsired end may also be attained by Chemical dis- infectants. Fumigations with brimstone, chlorine, and bromine, though much in use, are not very trustworthy ; but milk of lime is very efFectual, on account of its cheap- ness and its easy applicability to the disinfection of large masses of material. It is used in the proportion of one part of slaked lime to 4 litres of water : a bulk equal to that of the fluid to be disinfected being added to the latter. Chloride of lime is a stronger disinfectant than lime ; it is used as a powder, or a liquid mixture of one part chloride of lime to four parts water ; less of this solution is required than of the milk of lime, A very effective disinfectant is pure carbolic acid, of which a solution containing 5 per Cent, of carbolic is added to the liquid to be disinfected. Crude carbolic acid, on the other hand, is only efiicacious when the substances contained in it, which are insoluble in water, have been made soluble by the addition of a little sulphuric acid or potash solution. Corrosive Sublimate (mercuric chloride), lastly, is efFectual in a solution of i to 1000 or 2000, but some common salt must be added to the solution, otherwise insoluble Compounds of albumen may be formed in the liquid to be disinfected. All these disinfectants must be used of the proper strength, and allowed to act for some time, if they are to be successful. Therefore the whole mass must not be thrown away imme- diately after being sprinkled over with the disinfectant. Many objects which will not stand any of these methods may be well washed with soap. Wall-papers may be rubbed down with bread-crumbs, which carry with them all dust and dirt, and which should be afterwards burnt.

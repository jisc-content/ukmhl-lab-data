109 WATER which are occasionally found in water, are among the worst enemies of the health of man. Parasites of various kinds also often find their way into our bodies by means of drinking-water. The knowledge of these facts should not be a source of alarm to the timid, but of help to everybody. It supplies the reason why a constant provision of pure water is so essential to the health of the community. This Provision is in cities made the more important and the more difficult by the fact that the ground in the neighbour- hood of inhabited places, having been occupied for centuries, is so fouled as to be altogether unsuitable as a collecting- ground for water intended for human consumption. The best form of water supply for a town is that brought by means of aqueducts from springs arising in a higher level of the country. Almost as good, but more difficult to get at and bring to the spot, is sub-soil water from places where the soll has not been fouled. Only as a last resource should the supply be obtained from river water. Water from doubtful sources should always be filtered. By this process, matters in Suspension, including micro- organisms, are removed. It is of the greatest importance that the filter be frequently cleaned ; otherwise the remedy, by harbouring the micro-organisms, provokes disease. Still more important, the way the filter works should be understood by the purchaser, that he may use it intelligently, for in some of the best filters parts should be cleaned and parts let alone. From an hygienic point of view the water supply ought to fulfil the following conditions :— I. It must be pure, in which case the water is colour- less ; though water which is colourless is not necessarily pure.

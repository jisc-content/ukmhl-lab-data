The valve on the right side, the truuspidy consists of three, that on the left, the mitraly of two such flaps. From the apices of these triangulär folds, which hang downwards into the ventricles, cords pass to stout columns of muscles, the papillary musclesy jutting out from the Walls. When the ventricles are filled with blood, the flaps float up, and, meeting, com- pletely dose the openings about which they are set. Contraction of the ventricles only confirms this closure by driving the edges of the folds closer together; their ascent into the auricles is prevented by their tendinous cords, which, by the contraction of the pa- pillary muscles, are rendered tense enough to resist the up- wajd pressure of the blood in the contracting ventricles. Thus in this state the ven- tricles only communicate with the vessels opening into them. The vessels which lead from the ventricles, the pulmonary artery from the right, the aorta from the left, are stout tubes.

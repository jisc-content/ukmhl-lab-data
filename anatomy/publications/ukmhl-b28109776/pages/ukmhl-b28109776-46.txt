THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 36 for the most part longitudlnally ; the grey, of cells with branches similar to those of the brain-cells and of fine much-branchlng fibres. In a cross-section of the spinal cord (Flg. i8) the grey matter is seen to be disposed in two more or less crescent-shaped masses placed back to back, and connected by a Strand which, together with a small quantity of white matter on its ventral surface, separates the anterior and posterior fissures. The membranes of the cord are similar to those of the brain. Lining the vertebral, to the inner surfaces of which Fig. i8. — Transverse Section THROUGH THE SpiNAL CoRD IN THE Cervical Region, a, white matter 5 grey matter ; r, pos- terior root of a spinal nerve ; dy anterior root j/", central canal.

Each spinal nerve is connected with the cord by two branches, called the anterior and posterior roots. These roots spring to the surface of the cord opposite the horns of the crescent-shaped grey matter, from which in part they arise (Fig. 18, c, d).- Just before the point within the spinal canal at which the roots unite to form the nerve-trunk,

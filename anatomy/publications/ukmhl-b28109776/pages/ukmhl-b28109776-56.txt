THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 46 in so doing, slacken it so that it ceases to control the shape of the lens. The lens, released from this control, bulges forward by virtue of its elasticity (Fig. 23). Thus its anterior curvature becomes greater ; with that its refractive power is bicreased, and accommodation for near vision effected.y^ Whetf the effort of accommodation is relaxed, the ciliary muscles also relax ; the ligament falls back to its original Position, resumes its tension on the lens, drawing it taut and causing it to return to its more flattened form. / Auto- matically then, the Fig. 24.—Diagrammatic Sections eye becomes adjusted for far vision, in which condition it rests tili a new elfort of accom- modation produces anew the series of events just described.

The two most frequent defects in the eye, short- sightedness and long-sightedness, are connected with ac- commodation. In short-sightedness the images of distant objects do not fall upon, but somewhat in front of, the retina ; in long - sightedness the images of near objects would only be focussed behind the retina. In either case the elfect is due to one of two causes : too short a front-to- back diameter of the eyeball, or inability of the lens to

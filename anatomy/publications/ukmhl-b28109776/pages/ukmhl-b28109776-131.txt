THE DISPOSAL OF WASTE PRODUCTS 121 Wine made of grapes and not adulterated by the ad- dition of deleterious substances is, used in moderation, an agreeable beverage. The percentage of alcohol is 7 to 15 per Cent., and the danger therefore considerably less than is the case with “spirits.” Yet even with wine, habitual excess leads to severe bodily sufferings. The heavy wines of the South are mostly fortified by the addition of spirits of wine, and therefore have a similar effect to brandy. Beer contains little alcohol (2 to 9 per cent.), and, besides hops, 4 to 8 per cent. of malt-sugar and dextrin, 0*5 per Cent of albumen, salts, and carbonic acid. Good beer has therefore a certain nutritive value. Taken in excess, it injures the organs of circulation by the great quantity of liquid poured into the stomach, occasions hypertrophy and fatty degeneration of the circulatory apparatus, and so leads to apoplexy. Added to this is the destruction wrought by the alcohol contained in the beer—disturbances of the digestion, alfections of the kidneys, etc. Beer is often adulterated, other and injurious bitter substances being substituted for hops. It is also injurious when containing yeast, or even acid-forming bacteria, which speedily give rise to catarrh of the stomach. (g) The Disposal of Waste Products.—The waste products of the human body and household are partly directly injurious or poisonous, and partly indirectly so in supplying an excellent nidus for the growth of micro- organisms of all sorts. The necessity for their removal or destruction is obvious. Analyzed according to composition, waste products per head per annum come to 100 kilogs., sweepings, kitchen refuse, etc. ; 460 kilogs. solid and liquid excreta of the human body ; and up to 36,000 litres of water used. By proper Ventilation the gaseous waste products are led into the open air, where they are at once rendered inno- cuous by dilution and carried away by the constant motion of the atmosphere.

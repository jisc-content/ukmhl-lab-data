THE SPINAL CORD 35 sometimes unmeaning, grouping of ideas. Frequently, in dreams, the acdvity of the brain calls forth that of the body; the sleeper moves or speaks—the latter usually without coherence. It was believed tili recently that dreams only take place at the moment of awakening, or at times when sleep is less deep, and last only a short time. The belief is now gaining ground that even deepest sleep is never dreamless, and that dreams may present every gradation of coherence. {b) The Spinal Cord.—The central nervous system passes out of the skull by the occipital foramen. That part of it which lies in the spinal canal is called the spinal cord (Fig. i6). The spinal cord is a fusiform column of soft nervous tissue. It is thicker in its cervical and lumbar regions than in its dorsal region, and thins away again at its extremity to form the filum terminale. At the point where it leaves the skull it has a diameter of about 11 mms., and nowhere entirely fills the spinal canal. At each vertebra it gives olF a pair of spinal nerves, which pass out from the spinal canal through spaces between the neural arches, At the lower end the pairs of nerves before passing out of the canal, run down it for some distance, forming a bündle of fibres, the cauda equina. Deep fissures occur in the median line of the cord, one in front, the anterior ßssure, another at the back, the posterior fissure (Figs. i8, 19). At the bottom of each of these fissures is a narrow bridge of nervous tissue surround- ing the central canal (Fig. 18,/'). Like the brain, the spinal cord consists of grey and white matter, though, unlike the arrangement of these substances in the brain, the white matter lies at the surface of the cord, the grey at the interior (Fig. 18, a, b). As in the brain, the nervous elements of the white and grey matter are embedded in a supporting non-nervous ground- work of neuroglia. The white matter consists of groups of fibres running

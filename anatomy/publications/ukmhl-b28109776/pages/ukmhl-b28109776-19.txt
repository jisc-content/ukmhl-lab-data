9 THE SKULL The joints between the atlas and axis are looser than those between the typical vertebra already described, and so allow sufficient play to the atlas, which, in the act of turning the head, moves with the skull. In nodding, the atlas remains still, and the head moves on the two smooth joints, which it makes with that bone. As in all movements of the vertebral column, so especially here, the spinal cord is protected from strains. The sacral region of the vertebral column consists, in early life, of live vertebrae, which later become welded together into one bone, the sacrum. The coccyx consists originally of four small bones, which also in later life may become joined to form one. The vertebral column serves as a support to the trunk, and requires for this so high a degree of solidity as to pre- clude much mobility. Therefore the bodies of the indi- vidual vertebrae are connected together by tough, elastic discs of fibrous cartilage, the intervertebral discs, which only permit a slight lateral rotation. The joints between the vertebrae, borne as already described on the small lateral processes, allow only very slight movements backwards and forwards. The vertebral column presents in its course a sinuous curvature, forwards in the cervical and lumbar regions, and backwards in the dorsal and sacral regions (Fig. 2). Although the trunk is attached almost entirely to the front of the vertebral column, its weight, by reason of this curva- ture, is so distributed that part falls in front and part behind. Through the one part tending to balance the other, the muscles are to some extent relieved from the task of supporting the trunk. 2. The Skull.—The skull (Fig. 6) comprises two groups of bones—those which form the or brain-case, and those, the bones of the face, which partly serve as Supports tothe Organs of the senses, and partly stand in some relatioii to the processes of speaking, breathing, eating. The cranium is composed of eight large bones.

22 ( II. The Muscles The movements of the body are executed by muscles, which, according to their structure, are distinguished as smooth and striated. A striped or striated muscle is so called because, when examined microscopically, its bundles of fibres, as well as the individual fibres, present a transversely banded appear- ance. A single fibre under sufficiently high magnification shows alternating bright and dim transverse discs, to which this banded or striped appearance is due. The ultimate elements of smooth muscle—muscle-cells—present, on the con- trary, no such cross-marking. The muscles of the alimentary canal, iris, blood-vessels, etc., are smooth ; those of the skeleton in general are striated. In what follows the term “muscle” applies, unless it be otherwise expressly stated, only to striated muscle. Every muscle is a red, fleshy mass, consisting of bundles of fine muscular fibres. Each bündle of fibres is sur- rounded by a sheet of connective tissue, which also binds the bundles together, forms a layer investing the whole muscle and enters at the two ends into the formation of the tendon. The tendons (Flg. 15,/') are very much firmer and tougher than the muscles themselves ; they connect the muscles with the bones or other attachments, and serve to effect the transference of force from the muscles to the parts moved. The mass of the muscle is termed the belly ; the point where the tendon is fixed to the bone toward which motion is directed, is called the origin, and the opposite point at which the tendon is connected with the part moved, the

V. The Bxcretion of Waste Substances 84 In addition to the lungs, which are the organ of excretion of the greater part of the carbon dioxide and of a variable quantity of water, the kidneys and the skin are concerned in the process of excretion. By the former the waste sub- stances of proteid metabolism are removed from the body, and by both water and various salts are got rid of. {a) The Kidneys.—The kidneys (Fig. 28, /) are two red-brown, bean-shaped glands, 12 cms. long, 6 cms. broad, and 4 cms. thick. They are placed on either side of and dose to the vertebral column, halfway up the abdomen. Their substance is made up of a great number of narrow tubes, embedded in a small quantity of connective tissue. These tubules have, in their origin toward the outer part (cortex), an irregulär looped course, but in the deeper tissues run parallel with one another. They open into one another, and finally discharge their contents into a cavity, the pelvis of the kidney, which occurs at its incurved portion, and which opens outward into the ureter. The ureters^ one from each kidney, convey the excretion (urine) to the bladder (Fig. 28, r), in which it is tempo- rarily stored. The tubules of the kidney are richly sup- plied with blood-vessels, and are lined internally in some parts with flat, in others with large cubical or irregulär epithelial cells. The regions in which these latter occur are the secretory parts of the tubules. It is by the activity of these cells that the most characteristic nitrogenous con- stituent of the urine, urea, as well as some other substances, are eicreted. The cortical end of each tubule terminates in an

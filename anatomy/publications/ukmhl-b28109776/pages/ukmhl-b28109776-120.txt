HO NECESSARIES OF LIFE Organic substances, 5 cgrs. Chlorine (in combination), 2-5 cgrs. Sulphuric acid (in combination), 3 cgrs. There should not even be traces of ammonia or nitrous acid, and the number of bacteria should not exceed 250 per centimetre ; of disease-producing germs there should, of course, be none.] 2. The water supply should be sufficient, i.e. about 80 litres per head per day. 3. It should be cheap. 4. It should have the pressure necessary to reach the top floors of houses. 5. It must be brought through pipes not liable to impart to it any hurtful elements: therefore neither through leaden nor through iron pipes. 6. It should be constant, so that storage in cistems is avoided. (e) Soil.â€”The soil on which we live has its influence on our well-being. The degree of porosity and capacity for becoming foul are qualities of the sub-soil which have an important bearing on health. The less porous the sub-soil, the more water accumulates above it, and, becoming stagnant, proves a source of danger. Very impervious soils favour the formation of swamps. Swampy regions are the home of intermittent fevers and malaria. In England and America a decrease in this last- mentioned disease has been observed after the draining of extensive areas of swamp-land. Of great importance, too, is the level of the sub-soil water. In damp strata, which also contain organic matters, a particularly abundant development of bacteria takes place. Bacteria are not found in the sub-soil water itself to any extent worth mentioning, but if its level sinks, the Stratum just left by the water may become, whilst still damp, a focus for the rapid development of bacteria, among which disease-producing germs may occur. Thus is explained the deleterious influence which fluctuations in the level of the

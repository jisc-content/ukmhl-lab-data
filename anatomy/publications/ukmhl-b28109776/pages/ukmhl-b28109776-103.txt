THE LARYNX 93 common to all voices, but dis- tinguished in each case hy the timbre. The most important use of the voice is in speaking. Articulate sounds are com- posed ofvowels and consonants, but the limits between these two groups are not very clearly defined. The vowels are a, e, i, o, u, and are simple sounds of the larynx which owe their par- ticular timbre to the fact that, for each, a particular position of the mouth, lips, etc., is re- quired (Fig. 32). The consonants are sounds caused exclusively or partially by the friction of the air pass- ing out under peculiar condi- tions. They are grouped as— {a) Labials, \h) Dentals, \c) Palatals, according as one or other 01 the parts suggested by these names is principally concerned in their formation. Within each of these groups we distinguish further— 1. Explosives, in the produc- tion of which the air passes out suddenly through the bar- rier formed by lips, teeth, or palate. 2. Fricatives, if it passes out gradually. Fig. 32.—Diagram of the Position of the Mouth-parts in the Articulation of the five Vowels,

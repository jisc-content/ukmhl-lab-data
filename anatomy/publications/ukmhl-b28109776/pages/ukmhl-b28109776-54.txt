THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 44 The optic nerves originate in the brain, and, emerging, appear passing round the under surfaces of the crura cerebri. Arrived at the middle line, they cross one another at the optic chiasma (Fig. 20, b\ so that the optic nerve of the left eye goes to the right side of the brain, and that of the right eye to the left side. The nutrition of the interior of the eye is carried on by the blood-vessels of the choroid and of the retina. The lens and the vitreous humour contain no blood-vessels. The bony framework of the eye, the eyelids, and the lachrymal apparatus furnish a series of arrangements,for the external protection of the eye. The sclerotic serves for the insertion of the eye-muscles and for the protection of the interior parts of the eye, while the cornea allows of the access of light to 1 the eye. The iris regulates the quantity of light penetrating into the eye ; it moves by the agency of its muscles in such a manner that an increase in the amount of light entering the eye causes a narrovv- ing of the pupil, a decrease a dilation. Like other movements executed by Fig. 22. — Diagram unstriped muscle, those of the iris are sHowiNG THE 1^0- slow, a considerable contraction requir- DUCTION OF A Re- • i 1 TINAL Image. mg over half a second. The cornea, the aqueous humour, the vitreous humour, and especially the lens, refract the entering rays of light so that an actual, though inverted and reduced, picture of the object looked at appears upon the retina. This picture is termed the retinal image (Fig. 22). Images which come to a focus in front of or behind the retina give rise only to indistinct vision.

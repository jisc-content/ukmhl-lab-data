HEARING ST canal (Fig. 25, b) is a tube about 2-5 cms. long and 5*1 mms. wide, situated within the temporal bone. On its outer side its walls are formed by cartilage continuous with that of the “ear,” further inward by bone covered with membrane. The tympanu membrane (Fig. 25, c\ which closes the inner end of the external auditory canal, is a somewhat tense, almost circular membrane, attached at its edges to the bony wall. It Stands obliquely to the axis of the canal, sloping downwards and backwards. The tympanic cavity, or middle ear (Fig. 25, d), is an irregulär hollow space in the temporal bone. From it a narrow funnel-shaped tube, the Eusiachian tube (Fig. 25, «), runs fbrwards, inwards, and down- wards, to open into the pharynx, thus admitting of the entrance of air from the mouth to the cavity of the middle ear. Stretching across the tympanic cavity are the three small bones of the ear (Fig. 2.^-, e^ f g, and Fig. 26), the malleus, incus, and stapes. The hammer (or mal- leus, Figs. 25 r, 26 <7, b') is at- tached vertically to the tympanic membrane by a long, slender, handle-like process, and fixed by another process to the bony wall of the middle ear. The head of the malleus has a cartilaginous surface, to which the thicker part of the incus, or anvil (Figs. 25 /, 26 f), is articulated. The other, thin end of the incus ■articulates with a stirrup-shaped bone, the stapes (Figs. 25 g^ 26 d). The face of the stapes rests against an oval membrane, the fenestra ovalis (Fig. 25, /), which closes an opening in the bony wall of the middle ear. The internal ear (Fig. 25, k, i, k) consists of a membranous sac of very complicated shape and structure, lying, for the Fig. 26.—The Bones of the Ear. a, malleus 5 b, process of the malleus, which at- taches it to the tympanic membrane ; c, incus ; ä, stapes.

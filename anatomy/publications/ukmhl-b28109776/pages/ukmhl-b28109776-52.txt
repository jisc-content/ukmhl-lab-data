42 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM a bluish-white, very strong and tough membrane, from ^ mm. to mm. in thickness. Its anterior surface, the com£d^ is somewhat more convex than the rest, and has the form and transparency of a watch-glass (higs. 21 c, 23 c). Somewhat below, a little to the inner, nasal, side of the centre of the posterior wall (Fig. 22, /), the optic nerve passes through the sclerotic coat. The second layer investing the eyeball is the black pig- mented choroid (Fig. 21, d)^ a very thin and vascular mem- brane, which is also pierced ^ posteriorly by the optic nerve. It lies dose against the sclerotic, and is attached to the rim of the cornea, over which, how- ever, it does not pass. Instead, it is disposed vertically to form the iris (Figs. 21, 23 f). The iris is stouter than the choroid, and its colour, brown, Fig. 21.—Diagrammatic Sec- grey, or blue, gives the colour to the eye. It is pierced in the middle by a circular aperture, _ _ _ the pupil^ the size of which is Ä, anterior chamber of the eye ; modified by the contraction of ;, crystalline lens 5 posterior the smOOth muscles of the iris.

Near its attached edge, on its internal surface, the iris bears a number of folds, the ciliary processes (Figs. 21, 23 e). The ciliary processes form a ring, to which the suspensoi-y ligament (Fig. 23, m) of the lens is attached.

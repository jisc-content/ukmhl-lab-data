THE SKULL 13 The incisors are somewhat shovel-shaped, their tops forming sharp edges ; the canines, except that they are more pointed, resemble the incisors in shape and in function. The bicuspids are pointed ; the hinder ones, as well as the molars, have broad uneven surfaces with protuberances, to facilitate chewing. The incisors and canines serve, by means of vertical movements of the lower jaw, to bite ofF the food, whilst the real work of mastication, the comminution of solid substances, is carried out by bicuspids and molars, aided by lateral and rotatory movements of the lower jaw. Human beings are, as a rule, born without teeth ; during the first two years, the temporary or milk teeth, twenty in number, make their appearance. They consist of incisors, canines, and premolars. After the seventh year, the milk teeth fall out, and are replaced by permanent teeth, the molars being the last to make their appearance. Unlike the milk teeth, the permanent teeth are not replaced when lost. With the exception of the lower jaw, all the bones of the skull are connected by sutures. The largest and most important of these are : the coronal suture, between the frontal and parietal bones ; the sagitial suture, which unites the two parietal bones ; and the occipital sutures, where the parietal bones join the occipital bone. In early life these skull-bones are separated by Strips of cartilage, and it is only later that the bones are firmly United by the sutures. Those between the frontal and parietal bones are the last to be closed. The measurements of the skull show considerable varia- tions in different individuals, and especially in different races (Fig. 8, ö, 1)). The illustrations are of extreme cases of the skull of a brachycephalous (short-headed) (Fig. 8, a), and of a dolichocephalous (long-headed) (Fig. 8, b') individual. Between these two extremes, skulls of all imaginable pro- portions occur. 3. The Thorax.—The ribs are lateral appendages of

The metatarsal bones (Fig. 13, ^ are five in number, that to which the bones of the big toe are attached being the longest. The bones of the toes, the phalanges (Fig. 13, e), are similar in number and disposition to those of the hand. Where the foot touches the ground in front, at the articulations of the great and little toe with the foot, are found with tolerable regularity two small bones, termed sesa- moid bones (Fig. 13,yi- The leg has to bear the weight of the trunk, and the Fig. 13.—Longitudinal Section through foot that of the whole THE Foot in the Line of the Big Toe. body.

The leg, however, has much greater solidity than the arm, and the pelvic girdle, firmly United with the vertebral column, a greater rigidity than the pectoral girdle. The hip-joint is a ball-and-socket joint, in which, how- ever, several strong ligaments prevent an equal degree of motion in all directions. The trunk does not bear im- mediately on the articulation, but its weight is in part transferred to the femur through the round ligament. This is a strong ligament passing from the head of the femur

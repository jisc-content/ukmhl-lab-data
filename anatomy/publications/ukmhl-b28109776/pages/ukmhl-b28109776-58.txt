THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 48 double images. This, in fact, takes place ; but experience, especially that gained by the sense of touch, has taught us from early childhood that such objects, seen double, exist singly, and so we becorae accustomed at a very early age to disregard one of the images. This is rendered still easier by the fact that the attention is directed to the exact point looked at. Only of this does the image fall on the yellow spot, not that of the other points. Images falling on points of the eye other than the yellow spot also lack detail of shape and colour. The eye informs us as to the shape, colour, size, and distance of objects. The form of the retinal image determines the concept of shape, though the consciousness takes into consideration the stereoscopic proportions imported into the appearance by the Union of the two retinal images. The Sensation of colour is connected with the more delicate structure of the retina. Rays of certain wave- lengths falling thereon give rise to the various colour- sensations. White is the Sensation produced by the col- lective impact of the rays which individually produce the colour-sensations of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and vioiet (the spectral colours). Black is the absence of light-sensation. Total or partial absence of sensitiveness to colour is called colour-blindness; it is in most cases connected with a specially acute sensitiveness towards brightness, so that the defect is partially remedied. The human eye is not sensitive towards all rays, those lying beyond the red at one end and the vioiet at the other end of the spectrum are invisible to it. j The apparent size of an object depends on the size of the retinal image, and this again on the visual angle. By visual angle is meant the angle formed by two imaginary lines drawn from the focus of the lens to the furthest limits i of an object. All objects seen within the same visual angle i appear of the same size. Experience, comparison with

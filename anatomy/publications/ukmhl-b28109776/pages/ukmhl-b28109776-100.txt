90 THE LARYNX plane with the back of the larynx, the other two jut out wedge-wise into its cavity. The apex of each arytenoid bears a small cartilage, called Saniorini^s cartilage (Fig. 29, e). In the middle of the upper edge of the thyrold rises a long narrow tongue of thin elastic cartilage, the epiglottis (Figs. 29 gt 30 h). In repose it Stands nearly vertically upright ; but by means of special muscles it can be turned over back- wards, so as to I. II. dose the larynx when food or drink is passing to the Oesophagus. The cartilages of the larynx are fastened to each C-— other, and to the hyoid bone, by ligaments and muscles.

The for- met can be made to incline forwards on its pivots on the upper edge of the cricoid cartilage, and then Hatten itself laterally ; each of the arytenoids can be caused, by the contraction of appropriate muscles, to slightly revolve round a vertical axis on the hinder edge of the thyroid cartilage, in such a manner that the inwardly projecting edge of one approaches that of the other.

27 THE MUSCLES these to the ribs, and provide chiefly for the movements of the back, more particularly serving to keep the trunk, in the course of its various movements, in equilibrium. In an erect position, the Services of these muscles are not required, for, as we have learned, the trunk is then in equilibrium, owing to the double curvature of the vertebral column. The outer layer of the pectoral muscles, which, starting from the Sternum, clavicles, and scapulae, pass to the upper arm, moves the whole arm. Deeper layers of muscles invest the thorax, Stretching from the Sternum and from each dorsal vertebra to the ribs. In the act of breathing an important part is played by these muscles, and also by the diaphragm (Fig. 28). This par- tition, convex when viewed from above, separates the thorax from the abdomen. From its central tendinous part muscles radiate to the body-wall. By the contraction of its muscles the diaphragm is flattened, and con- sequently the cavity of the ehest is increased (Fig. 25, A broad, thin muscular layer closes the abdominal cavity in front and at the sides. By its contraction the abdomen is compressed. The muscles of the arm are mostly in the form of elongated bundles. Those which move the lower arm originate on the upper arm ; those which turn the hand or flex and extend the fingers, on the lower arm. On the hand itself are only a few weak muscles for spreading the fingers apart, for special movements of the thumb, etc. In the pelvis powerful masses of muscles have their origin, reaching to the thigh and knee, and serving to Support the weight of the body in walking. In this they are also assisted by some of the muscles of the lower leg, while the rest of the latter effect the movements of the foot. The flexor and extensor muscles of the toes originate in the foot itself.

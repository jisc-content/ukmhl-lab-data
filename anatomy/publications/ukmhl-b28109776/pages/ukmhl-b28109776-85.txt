75 NUTRITION Expired air is warmer than inspired air, and is saturated with aqueous vapour. Its composition is— 7942 parts nitrogen per 10,000. 1620 „ oxygen „ 438 „ carbonic acid „ Of the oxygen contained in the inspired air, the lungs retain one-fifth and give ofF a rather less quantity of carbon dioxide. In the course of a day a total quantity of from 700 to 750 grams (= nearly 2^ ozs.) of oxygen gets into the body, while 850 to 900 grams of carbon dioxide, which has a specific gravity greater than oxygen, leave it. The amount of water given off by the body in repose varies considerably on either side of 2700 grams per day, of which some 300 grams (about half a pint) are given off from the lungs. The rate of breathing is subject to continual fluctuations. The time of day and the season of the year, weather, occu- pation, state of mind, the emotions, all exercise either an accelerating or a restraining influence on it. Muscular effort, more especially, enormously increases the output of carbon dioxide, doubling or even trebling it. The quantity of carbon dioxide breathed out provides a means of roughly estimating the expenditure of energy by the body, both in muscular work and in the vital activities (growth, etc.). It is thus computed that the energy daily required by the body to carry on its work is about double that expended by a labourer in an eight-hours’ day. After what has been said of the rok of oxygen in the body, it is perhaps needless to add that it is one of the elements essential to the life of all animals. (f) Nutrition.—The term “ nutrition ” is here used to indicate only the constructive changes whereby new material is prepared, new grist brought to the mill of life. This new material is the food ; but before it can be utilized, it has to be subjected to the action of the secre- tions of the alimentary canal, and of the glands which open

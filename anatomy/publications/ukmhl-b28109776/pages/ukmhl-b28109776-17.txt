7 THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN (f) General Survey of the Skeleton. The prin- cipal part of the skeleton is the spinal column with the superirnposed skull and the appended thorax : the bones of the limbs, together with those of the Shoulder and pelvic girdles, make up the rest. I. The Vertebral Column (Fig. 2). The vertebral column consists of thirty-three bones, the vertebr^e. These are grouped according to their position, thus : 7 Cervical ; 12 Thoracic or Dor- sal ; 5 Lumbar ; 5 Sacral ; 4 Coccygeal. The vertebrae of the first three regions are alike in general plan of structure. Each consists of a strong discoidal piece of bone, the body (Figs. 5, 9 a), to the back of which a ring of bone, the neural arch, is attached (Fig. 3, c). The neural arch bears three processes : the spinous process (Figs. 4 c, 5 and 9 b\ which arises in the median line and projects back- wards; and two transverse processes (Figs. 3 5 c, 9 c), which are borne laterally and serve for the attachment of muscles, except in the thoracic region, where they, together with the bodies of the vertebrae, bear the ribs. Smaller projec- tions, two above and two below (Fig. 5, e), also arising laterally on the neural arch, fit into corresponding de- pressions on the arches of the adjoining vertebrae, and form a double row of Fig* 2. â€” Longitudi- inter-vertebral articulations. nal Section through The space within the neural arches Column. of the vertebrae forms a channel, the spinal canal, in which runs the spinal cord, which tapers and

66 METABOLISM The amount of blood pumped from the heart in one beat is from 150 to 190 c.cms. The Work done by the whole heart in 24 hours is reckoned at about 75,000 kilogrammetres, equal to the work done in raising 75,000 kilogs. one metre—about a quarter of the average work done by a workman in 8 hours. This work is one of the sources of warmth for the body, as the whole of it is converted into heat by the friction of the blood against the sides of the vessels. The movements of the heart are accelerated by muscular activity, by heat, by various emotions, and by painful sensations. 3. The Blood’Vessels.—The tubes in which the blood flows are called blood-vessels ; they are of two kinds : one, the arteries, the walls of which are stout, elastic, and well provided with muscle ; the other, the veins^ whose walls are thin, collapsable, and possessed of but little muscular tissue. The arteries (Fig. 27, h) in their courses branch continually, becoming thinner-walled and smaller, and ulti- mately pass into the capillaries^ which are tubes of extreme minuteness, little wider, indeed, than the red corpuscles, and , whose walls consist of nothing but a film made upofa single ] layer of flat cells (Fig. 27, /, ^). The capillaries, running as a branching network through the tissues, are gathered up into veins, which, uniting with their fellows, form the great veins of the body (Fig. 27, f). Arteries and vein» are but the conducting apparatus, the capillaries are part I of the distributing apparatus. In addition to the above differences between arteries and veins, the latter often possess valves, disposed at intervals along their course, | pointing away from the capillaries, and so impeding the reflux of blood. The heart itself is supplied with blood by the two coronary arteries^ which spring from the aorta just beyond j its semi-lunar valve. The coronary vein, which gathers j up the blood from the capillaries supplied by these arteries» opens into the right auricle.

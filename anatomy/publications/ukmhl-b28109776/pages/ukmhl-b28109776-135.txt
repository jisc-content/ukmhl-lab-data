125 II. Hygienic Rules for Special Circumstances. (a) Schools.—Education being compulsory, it follows that it is the duty of the State or the community to see that teachers and scholars sufFer no injury to Health from their stay in the school buildings. For this purpose the schoolrooms must be of sufficient size, well lighted, warmed, and ventilated. The seats must not be so constructed as to occasion or favour wrong attitudes of the body. Inter- vals and change of work should be adopted in order to prevent fatigue, and the pursuit of all sorts of physical exercises encouraged. But even though these conditions be observed, the work of the school will be vain, unless the elementary principles of Hygiene are made part of the home training. One great danger of schools is the spread of infectious diseases (measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria). A child attacked by one of these must be kept away from school tili all danger of infection is over—in measles, for four weeks ; diphtheria, two ; scarlet fever, six weeks. For the same reason the brothers and sisters of the patient should also be kept at home, unless the patient has been isolated in time. If any such disease appears as an epidemic, the school must be closed at once, and the buildings thoroughly disinfected. In the case of weakly children, all kinds of “ school diseases ” appear in consequence of long sitting in vitiated air, and of the effort of learning. Digestive troubles, headache, and bleeding of the nose, short-sightedness, and curvature of the spine, are among the troubles so engendered.

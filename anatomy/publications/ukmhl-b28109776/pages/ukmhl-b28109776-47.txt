THE NERVES 37 the posterior of these bears a swelling, the poster'w root- ganglion (Fig. 19, The spinal cord is the connection between the brain and the majority of the nerves of the trunk and limbs, and therefore contains nerve-fibres for the production of all movements of these parts and those concerned in the transmission of afferent impulses, sensory as well as other. {c) The Nerves.â€”The nerves are white cords of various thicknesses, not consisting, however, of single threads, but composed of many very thin elongated nerve-fibres. Fach nerve-fibre is a thread of extreme thinness, consisting of a central Strand of protoplasm, the axis-cylinder process, which is nothing but the branch of the nerve-cell in which the fibre arises. Surrounding this essential part of the nerve is a fatty substance which is called the meduUa^ and, bounding this, a delicate sheath, the neurilemma. Some nerves are not medullated, that is, are devoid of the intermediate fatty layer. The nerve-fibres are bound into bundles by connective tissue, which also forms a sheath for the whole nerve. Along the course of the nerve, branches, consisting of bundles of its fibres, pass out to supply various parts. In other cases, branches originally separate may come for a time to be included in the same sheath, and thus form a plexus. Nerves may be distinguished, according to their function, as sensory^ niotor, secretory^ trophic^ and tonic. The nature and the functions of the first two kinds of nerves we have already considered. Secreiory nerves stand in the same relation to glands as motor nerves to muscles ; they conduct efferent impulses, which incite the organ to activity; only the activity consists, in their case, in the manufacture of special secretions, such as saliva. Trophic nei-ves are concerned with the control of the growth and well-being of the parts of the body to which they are distributed. They seem, by Controlling the nutrition of the part, to have much to do in maintaining

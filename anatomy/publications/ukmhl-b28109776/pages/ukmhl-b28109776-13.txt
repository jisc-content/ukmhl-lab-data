B 2 STRUCTURE AND ACTIVITIES OF THE BODY /. The Skeleton {ä) The Structure of Bones and Cartilages.—The bones, collectively called. the skeleton, serve as a supporting Framework to the rest of the body. To fulfil this rok two things are required in a bone : firmness and a certain degree of elasticity. Its component parts are likewise two : an organic part, the bone-matrix ; and an inorganic part, the bone-ash. If a bone be placed in dilute hydrochloric acid, the mineral substances are dissolved away, and it becomes soft and flexible. So treated a bone retains its shape, though it consists only of the organic part. By burn- ing, the organic part of bone is destroyed, and a white, friable mass, the bone-ash, also retaining the shape of the bone, is left. The inorganic constituents, which make up about two- thirds of a dry bone, consist mainly of phosphate of lime, 56 per Cent. ; carbonate of lime and other mineral salts, 13 per Cent. The rest, 31 per cent., consists of organic matter. These proportions, however, vary in different bones, and in a given bone at different periods of life (see Table II. p. 94). Most bones are formed from cartilage, which gradually gives place to bone by a serles of changes, which include the deposition of mineral matter. In the young state, before these changes occur, the cartilage-masses which are being changed into bone are incapable of supporting heavy weights, or of resisting strong pressure of any kind.

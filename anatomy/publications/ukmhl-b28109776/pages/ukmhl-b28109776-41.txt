THE BRAIN 3* side, which penetrate deep into the cerebral hemispheres. One of these clefts is seen on either side in Fig, 17, e. The cerebrum is divided by a longitudinal furrow, the median fissure (Fig. 17, ^), into two fairly symmetrical halves. This fissure cuts deep into the cerebrum from before, above, and behind. Fach hemisphere also bears a number of deep fissures, one of which, the fissure of Sylvius, commencing on 'the ventral surface, running roünd and reaching nearly to the median fissure, marks out the hemi- sphere into two unequal halves, Other fissures—of which the chief, named after the bones Fig. 17.—Vertical Cross Section through the Rrain. a, cortex, grey matter of the cerebral hemisphere ; b, white matter of the cerebral hemisphere ; c, fornix ; d, third ventricle ; e, lateral ven- tricle ; y, pons Varolii, cut obliquely and showing fibres running from it and forming the crura cerebri ; g, median fissure ; h, con- volutions (gyri) ; /, fissures (sulci) ; k, optic thalamus. covering them, are the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital— divide the surface of the cerebrum into as many lobes. In the temporal region of either side a part of the surface called the island of Reil is thrust deep into the brain. The surfilce of the lobes shows a number of raised convolutions, ox gyri, bounded by the fissures, or sulci (Fig. 17,

SOIL III sub-soil water may exercise on the general health. In damp Solls arefound the bacteria of malaria, tetanus (“ lock-jaw ”), typhus, and perhaps also of cholera. These may get into our bodies from the soll in variousways with drinking-water or along with particles of earth adhering to the food ; or by the drying up and flying away as dust of the upper layers of the soll. The air contained in the soll may also pollute that of our houses by passing up, especially in winter, into the heated rooms. Such air often contains ammonia, sulphuric acid gas, and carbon dioxide, but these substances are probably never contained in it in such quantities as to do harm. Sewer and coal gas may, perhaps, spread disease by passing through contaminated soll, and carrylng disease-germs thence to the atmosphere, though the most recent experi- ments seem to show that such gases carry very few bacteria. Air itself, passing up from the soll, Is free from germs. By suitable precautions most of the dangers just enumerated may be effectually combated. In the first place, the great quantity of decomposable Waste products of men, animals, and plants ought to be given over to the soll at a distance from human dwellings, in Order to be decomposed as quickly as possible, so that the fouling of the soll on which we live may, as far as possible, be avoided. So treated, these waste products become a prey to various kinds of bacteria, which break them up into harmless substances. Extensive applications of this method of sewage treatment are now becoming common in this country. A good System of sewers is essential for the carriage of all refuse of the house and of the streets to the places in which the scavengering bacteria are allowed to have full destructive play. The paving of streets and courtyards also prevents organic matter from penetrating in any quantity into the soll. It also allows the sub-soil of towns to free itself from former contaminations. Thus it has been observed that in many

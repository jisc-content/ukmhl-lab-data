45 SICHT If the eye and its parts were rigid, the ränge of sight would be very limited. As a matter of fact, however, clear Vision extends to almost any distance. The changes which take place in the eye when directed to near or distant objects are termed accommoda- tion. The eye at rest is, owing to the flatness of the anterior surface of the lens, accommodated to distant Vision. In this state, parallel rays of light — those pro- ceeding from a great distance—are brought to a focus on the retina, whilst near objects, if seen at all, produce but blurred Images, since the rays of light proceeding from them tend to come to a focus, not on the retina, but behind it. When the sight is directed to such near Fig. 23.—Diagrammatic Section through THE Anterior Part of THE Eye. The left side of the figure shows accommodation for far, the right for near, vision.

The changes in accommoda- tion, whereby this readjustment of the eye is brought about, have, as a result, the increased curvature of the anterior surface of the lens. In this condition the lens exerts a greater refraction on the rays of light passing through it, so that their focus is brought forward to coincide with the surface of the retina. ^ The change in dirvature of the lens is elfected by the contraction of the ciliary muscles to which (Fig. 23, ni) the suspensory ligament of the lens is attached. By their con- traction the ciliary muscles draw the ligament forward, and,

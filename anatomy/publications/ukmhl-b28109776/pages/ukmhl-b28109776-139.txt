INFECTION 129 Works should be subjected to certain restrictions in the interests of the people living near. For example, it should be required that factories purify their waste water before discharging it into the public water-ways. {d) Infection.â€”Various measures have been taken by the State to prevent the spread of disease. Schools are closed on the outbreak of an epidemic, and fairs, festivals, and other occasions for the assembling of large numbers of people, prohibited. For travellers Corning from infected districts, quarantine has been resorted to.

In countries such as France and Germany, where vacci- nation and revaccination are compulsory, small-pox is almost an unknown disease ; the few cases which do arise in these countries are usually imported from others, Between the years 1886 and 1892 there were, in the whole German empire, 891 cases of death from small-pox, of which 833 occurred in the frontier districts and in sea-ports. If, how- ever, vaccination is to have a lasting effect, it must be repeated at suitable intervals. It is to be deplored that in our country compulsion has been reduced by recent legisla- tion almost to a mere formula.

112 NECESSARIES OF LIFE towns, after the introduction of such improvements in drain- age, the mortality from typhus has been appreciably lessened. For example, at Munich, in 1858, of 100,000 inhabitants 333 died of typhus. After the town had in the following year been supplied with sewers and with wholesome drinking- water brought from mountain springs, this number has con- siderably diminished, so that now there are scarcely three per 100,000 yearly deaths from typhus. (/) Food. I. General Considerations.—Our food is composed of various materials, each of which is to be looked on as a mixture of simple food-stulfs. The simple food-stuffs are (besides water and air) proteids, fat, carbo- hydrates (starch, sugar, etc.), water, and salts. For nutrition man requires daily— About yy yy yy yy yy 700—750 grams of oxygen (i c.m.). 2700-2800 „ water litres). 30 70-150 30-90 340-570 salts. proteids fats. carbo-hydrates (see also p. 82). At the same time he excretes, beside 2700 grams of water, 850 grams of carbon dioxide, and the waste products of proteid metabolism about 40 grams per day in urine. Part of the food assimilated—more especially water, salts, a part of the fat, and the proteids—serves to build the body during growth, and replaces the matter consumed in the various vital processes, Another part—especially the carbo- hydrates and the greater part of the fat and proteids— supplies, in conjunction with the oxygen of the air, the energy necessary to the carrying on of the vital processes, 100 grams of fat supplying as much energy as 210 grams of albumen (a form of proteid), or 240 grams of carbo- hydrates. No sharp distinction is, however, to be drawn between the two possibilities just mentioned, since substances which are built up into the living protoplasm are also being

NECESSARIES OF LIFE ii6 the same nutritive value as that of cows. Cowsâ€™ milk contains 3 to 4 per cent. of proteids, 3 to 6 per cent. fat, 4 to 8 per Cent, milk-sugar and salts in varying quantities up to 7 per Cent., water making up the rest. It may therefore, in case of necessity, be used as sole food, even by adults. Milk is richer in summer than in winter. Evening milk contains twice as much cream as morning milk ; the milk drawn last is richer than that drawn first, and milk of cows in the country is richer than that coming from town dairies. After long Standing, especially in a warm place, milk becomes sour. In this state it may quite well be taken, in not too great quantities. The skim-milk remaining after the cream has been removed from the surface of milk which has been allowed to stand for a time, is an excellent cheap food, always providing that the necessary fat, which has been withdrawn from it by skimming, be supplied in some other way. By shaking or beating the cream which collects on the surface of milk, butter is obtained. A litre of milk yields about 30 grams of butter. Cheeses, of the kinds in general use in this country, are made by causing the milk to curdle by the addition of a rennet ferment. The curd consists of 3 proteid, casein, and of fat. Others, cream-cheeses, are made from the cream only. Cheese contains 22 to 32 per cent. of proteids, and 40 to 60 per cent. of fat, and therefore is two to three times as rieh in nutritive material as meat, though by no means of two or three times the nutri- tive value of the latter. For, as we have already observed, the nutritive value of a food is to be measured, not only by the quantity of its contained food-stulFs, but also by the readiness with which they are digested. Milk has its dangers. Through milk, such diseases of animals as tuberculosis and foot-and-mouth disease may be transmitted to man. By accidental contamination of milk, typhus, cholera.

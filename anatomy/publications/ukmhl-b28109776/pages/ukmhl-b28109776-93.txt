DIGESTION IN THE STOMACH, ETC. 83 There is no food-stufF, except milk, which contains all these materials in the proportions required by the body. Food-stufFs, therefore, must be mixed. Of the great variety of food-stufFs we may enumerate the most important. Meat contains water, salts, proteids, gelatin, and Fat. Milk: water, salts, proteids, fat, carbo-hydrates, sugar. Egg: Proteids, fat, water. Grain: proteids and starch, with little water. Peas and beans: the same. Potatoes: poor in proteid, but rieh in starch and water. Fruit: sugar, salts, organic acids, and much water. Vegetables (green parts of plants) are also poor in proteids, but contain starch, sugar, and salts. Besides food, stimulants are of assistance to digestion, the most important being common salt, less so spices, etc. Of drink, water is by far the most important. Milk is a food. Tea, cofFee, alcoholic liquors are stimulants, or merely means of enjoyment.

There are twelve pairs of ribs, of which the upper seven pairs are termed the true ribs, the rest the false ribs. Each rib makes with its vertebra two articulations —one with the body, the other with the transverse process (Fig. 9, e, f). At the other end each of the first ten ribs on either side terminates in a cartilage, which in the true ribs is attached to the breast-bone, in the false ribs to the cartilage of the preceding rib. The ends of the two last ribs are free, and bear no cartilage. The Sternum is a flat bone, originally consisting of a numbcr of bony plates corresponding to the number of the ribs attached to it. All but two of the sutures connecting these bony plates disappear, so that the Sternum comes to have only three divisions. Ribs and breast-bone together form a whole, whose parts are incapable of separate movement. Apart from the pro- tection afforded by the thorax to the Organs sheltered within it, the Principal task of the bony framework of the ehest is to facilitate the movements connected with respiration. 4. The Limbs.—The bones of the limbs are appended to the vertebral column through those of the shoulder and pelvic girdles. The pectoral, or shoulder-girdle, consists of the scapu/a, or shoulder-blade, and the clavicle, or collar-bone. The scapula is a thin triangulär plate of bone lying at the back of the thorax. Its inner edge is quite smooth, its

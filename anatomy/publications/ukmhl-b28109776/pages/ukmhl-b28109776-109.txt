THE LAWS OF HEALTH 99 /. Necessaries of Life It is the object of hygiene to examine the external circumstances under which man lives in Order to ascertain the most favourable conditions for his bodily welfare. To this end it seeks also to discover the causes of disease, and to point out the way to prevent or eure it. Man’s well-being is determined by many complicated circumstances, one dependent on another, though the exact relationships between them it is not always easy to unravel. As absolutely necessary for the permanent well-being of man, we may enumerate— 1. Pure air. 2. Certain conditions of temperature and atmospheric pressure. 3. Sunlight. 4. Water, of sufEcient quantity and purity. 5. A soil free from noxious influences. 6. Food enough, and of the right sort. 7. The means of rendering harmless the waste products of our bodies, our households, and our industries. {a) The Air. —For the composition of air, see p. 74. We take oxygen from the air, and we give back to it carbon dioxide. The nitrogen contained in the air is directly important to us only as a diluent of the oxygen, the latter in a pure state acting as a poison. Fresh supplies of oxygen can only be dispensed with as long as the small reserve stored up in the blood is un- consumed. This takes place so quickly that lack of oxygen causes almost instant death.

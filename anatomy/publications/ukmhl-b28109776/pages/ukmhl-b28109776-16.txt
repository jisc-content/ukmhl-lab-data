6 THE SKELETON h 'c The bones of the joint are kept in positlon by the liga- ments, but also by atmospheric pressure and by adhesion consequent upon the dose contact of the surfaces. Atmo- spheric pressure and adhesion alone are sufficient to counter- act the weight of the parts connected with the joint, for when musdes and ligaments are cut avvay and only the synovial membrane left endosing the joint, the bones still remain in position. The amount of movement which a joint executes is often limited by special clieck- arrangements, e.g. at the elbow-joint by a strong ligament, and also by the projection of the ulnar behind the point of Insertion of the humerus ; in other places ligaments alone serve to restrict the movement. Thus in the thigh-joint, a very strong ligament connecting the pelvis and the thigh prevents the trunk from falling backwards when the body is in a Standing position. The movements possible to joints vary in extent and direc- tion according to the form of the joint-surfaces. Specially important forms of articulation are Ainge joints^ in which the articular surfaces are cylindrical and the movement only in one direction and its opposite ; ball-and-socket ]o\nts^ with spherical articular surfaces admitting of movement in all directions. Few joints are purely of the one form or the other, most being combinations of these simple forms, and so admitting of the different kinds of movement peculiar to these forms. In some cases the articular surftces are quite irregulär, but in the human body they are never flat. Fig. I.—Bones of the Middle Finger.

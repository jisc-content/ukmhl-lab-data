THE SKELETON 12 bones to form the javv. The joints so formed execute rotatory and pushing movements downwards, laterally, and backwards and forwards. The edges of the lower and also of the upper jaw contain hollows, alveoli^ into which the teeth are inserted. Adults possess thirty-two teeth, similarly arranged, both as regards kind and number, in the tvvo jaws. On either side of the middle line are two incisors, next to these on each side is a canine tooth, then two bicuspids, and three molars— 3+2+I+4+I+2+3 + I + 4 + I + 2^^3 The part of the tooth inserted into the jaw is the fang; the free biting part, the crown (Fig. 7). Between the two is the neck. The incisors and canines (Fig. 7,1.) have a single fang, the molars (Fig. 7, II.) several fangs. In the formet case the tooth is kept firm in its cavity by an enlargement of the neck ; in the latter this is ^ effected by the divergence of the several fangs. A tooth consists chiefly of den- t'me, a hard bony substance, in which occur a great number of minute tubes running parallel to one another (Fig. 7, a). The dentine of the fang is covered by bone, called the cement; that of the crown by the denser, harder, and brilliantly white enamel (Fig. 7, b). The dentine of the neck and fangs encloses a space, the pulp-cavity (Fig. 7, r), which is filled with soft pulp, and in which run the blood-vessels and nerves of the tooth. From the cellular elements of the pulp, processes extend into the dentine tubules. -O.

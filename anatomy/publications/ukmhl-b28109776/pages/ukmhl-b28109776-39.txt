29 THE BRAIN and depressions it faithfully fol- lows. Between dura- and pia- mater is a third membrane, the arachnoid, consist- “ ing of loose con- nectlve tissue, in the spaces of w h i c h small quantlties offluid occur. Viewed from the dorsal surface, the brain appears to consist of two main parts — a larger part in front, the cere- brum (Fig. 16, ^), and a smaller part behind, the cere bellum (Fig. \6, h). The lat- ter is about one- eighth the size of the whole brain, and occupies the occipital region of the cranial cavity. Loolcedatfrom beneath and from the sides, it is seen that the spinal cord gra- dually increases in diameter to form the medulla oblongata, the con- necting nervous link between brain and spinal cord (Fig. i6,y). On the under side, the medulla is continued as the pons (Figs. 16 k, and 17 _/'), the greater part of whose substance divides anteriorly into two diverg- ing arms — the crura cerebn (Fig. 16 0), which enter into the cerebral hemi- spheres ; the Fig. 16.—Longitudinal Median Section through the Skull and Ver- tebral CoLUMN, exposing THE Brain AND SpiNAL CoRD. a, cranium ; b, Upper jaw ; c, lower jaw ; d, bodies of the vertebrae ; e, spinous pro- cesses ; f, sacrum ; g, cerebrum ; //, cerebellum ; /, spinal cord ; spinal cord passing at the level of first lumbar vertebra (x) into the filum terminale, yV; cc, cauda equina, consisting of the bündle of nerve-roots surrounding filum terminale ; j, medulla oblongata ; ky pons Varolii ; /, anterior and posterior corpora quadrigemina; w, Corpus callosum 5 «, fornix ; 0, one of the crura cerebri.

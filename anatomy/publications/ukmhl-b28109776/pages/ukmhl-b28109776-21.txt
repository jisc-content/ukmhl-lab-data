11 THE SKULL The frontal bonc is formed by the complete and seamless junction in the median line of two lateral bones. Traces of the medial suture are to be seen above the root of the nose. The largest of all the bones of the face is the upper jaw- bone (Fig. 6, /), consisting of two symmetrical halves joined by a median suture. Its most massive part is that which bears the upper teeth. From this a plate, the bony basis of the hard palate, Stretches horizontally backwards. A further flat piece turns upward from the lower edge to the orbit, and forms a great part of the face. This part bounds the front of the nasal cavity, and contains within itself two hollow spaces of considerable size, the lateral cavities of the nose. The palatal part of the upper jaw-bone is continued back- wards as the twopalatalhonQSâ€”two flat plates fitted at right angles to one another. The bone called the votner lies unsymmetrically in the middle line of the head. Its vertical ridge supplies the bony Support to the septum of the nose. Above the palate the nasal cavities contain discs of bone, thin as paper, and some of them rolled up, scroll-like, the turbinal bones. The outer roof of the nose is formed by the two small thin nasal bones (Fig. 6, e). An elastic cartilage, an excellent pad in case of blows or falls, forms the continuation of these as far as the point of the nose. The two^ cheek-bones (Fig. 6, are thin laminm of bone. Their inner edges form the outer edges of the Orbits. Of the four projections of the cheek-bones, two unite with the upper jaw, one with the frontal bone, and One, Stretching backwards, assists in the formation of the zygomatic arch. Two small, thin bones, the lachr^mal bones (Fig. 6, y'), are inserted on the inner side of each orbit. The lower jaw-bone (Fig. 6, h) consists of two branches so firnily fused in the median line as to obliterate the suture. The two upper ends articulate with the temporal

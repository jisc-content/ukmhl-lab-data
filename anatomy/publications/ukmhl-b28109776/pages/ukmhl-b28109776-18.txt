The transverse processes are, as might be expected, especially strong in the twelve thoracic vertebras. The first cervical vertebra, the atlas (Fig. 3), differs in form from the type just described. It is a thin ring of bone bearing on its upper side two articular sur- faces (Fig. 3, ^), which unite it firmly with the base of the skull. The second cervical vertebra, the axis (Fig. 4), bears on its body a process, the odontoid process (Fig. 4, b) which fits into the front part of the ring of the atlas and serves Fig. 5.—Fourth and Fieth Thoracic Vertebr.« (seen from the side). a, body ; by spinous process ; c, trans- verse process ; d, upper, c, lower, intervertebral arti- cular processes ; f, articu- lar surface for a rib. as a pivot on which the atlas with the skull can be turned.

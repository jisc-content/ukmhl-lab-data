86 THE EXCRETION OF WASTE SUBSTANCES elastic fibres, and in its lower parts often much fatty tissue ; the latter is a useful auxiliary in the protection of the underlying parts. In special regions the skin bears hairs and nails, which, like the epidermis, are produced by the active division of cells of the Malpighian layer. The hairs consist of a hollow tube of hard dry cells surrounding a shaft of looser cells. They arise from pits, the hair-follicles, at the bottom of which are small papillae, whose cells form the hair. Pigments of various colours occurring in the shaft of the hair give to it its colour; when partial ly replaced by air, greyness is produced ; when the pigment wholly disappears, the hair becomes white. The secretory organs of the skin are the sweat glands^ and to a lesser degree the sebaceous glands. The former are coiled tubes lying in the dermis, and lined by secretory epithelium. They are connected with the exterior by tubulär, sinuously running passages in the epidermis, which open on the exterior as the pores of the skin. Their secretion, perspira- tion, always being formed, is a watery fluid containing small quantities of common salt and of various organic bodies. Special glands, the sebaceous glands^ ,open into the hair- follicles, into which they pour a fatty secretion. The quantity of sweat produced varies inversely with the amount of urine excreted. Any causes tending to dilate the blood-vessels of the skin—nervous States, e.g. blushing, hot weather, etc.—bring about an increase in perspiration, and so indirectly a decrease in the amount of urine. The skin allows, though but slowly, the entrance of some substances, as water, and Solutions of salts into the blood ; a process of which advantage is taken in medicinal baths.

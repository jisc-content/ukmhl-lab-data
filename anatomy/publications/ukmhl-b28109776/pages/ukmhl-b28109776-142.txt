III. Care of the Body {a) The Skin .—The skin forms a protective covering to the body, and excretes water and some waste matters through the pores. It is, moreover, as we have learned, an important agent for the regulation of the temperature of the body. The skin performs its work most effectually when the accumulation of the fatty substances excreted, as well as of the dead scales of the scarf-skin and any other dirt, is prevented by scrupulous cleanliness. By the process of “ hardening,” that is, by gradually accustoming the skin to the Stimulus of cold, it may be made capable of enduring unavoidable changes of tempera- ture. The best means to this end are baths. When possible, a tepid or cold bath should be taken daily. Warm baths, not over 35° C., should be followed by cold sponging, or a douche. It is hurtful to remain too long in a bath. A gradual and uniform cooling usually does no harm, even if it reaches almost the point of freezing ; but great fluctuations of temperature, especially if the cold only affects one part, while other parts are exposed to warming influences, are special ly apt to derange the temperature-regulating activity of the skin. Such rapid chills drive the blood back from the skin to the internal Organs. If the subject has a- weak place anywhere— whether a mucous membrane subject to catarrh, or a small tuberculous or easily inflamed part in the lungs, a nerve altered by neuralgia, a decayed tooth, or a tonsil subject to Inflammation—such a back-rush of the blood is almost certain to produce, at such spots incapable of 13^

ON LUMBAR ABSCESS. S78 itself. I was the rather for its being opened, as the man could move the limb in any directior without pain ; and, indeed, his never having suf- fered any from the first, induced me to believe the bones were not yet affected. But, as I was sen- sible the contents lay very deep, I could not say how long he might be secure from this evil. The contents of the tumor, it was agreed on all hands, were fluid ; I therefore persuaded him to have it opened, and to have the fluid drained off gradually. I think it was two or three days after this, that the most depending part of the anterior and small- er tumor was punctured with a common trocar, and about two pints of a wheyish fluid drawn off; after which, the canula was stopped with a cork, and secured with some cross slips of plaster, com- press, and roller. The man bore the evacuation very well, and suffered neither pain nor uneasiness from the canula being left in. The next day (Sep- tember 2), I visited the man with Mr. P. He com- plained of great chiljiness, and said, his ague was come again, but that it would soon go off, as it al- ways had done before. The dressings were removed, and three pint basins-full more were taken off, the fluid being thin and turbid. As the man complain- ed of sickness at the stomach, he was dressed up as before, but rolled tighter, and so put to bed. The tumor, however, was not half emptied, but both cavities were rendered equally lax, which plainly shewed that they communicated.

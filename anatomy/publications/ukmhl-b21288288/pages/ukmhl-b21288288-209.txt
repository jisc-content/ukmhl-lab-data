The thickness of the muscular structure was the same on both sides of the heart. The foramen ovale was open. Case 58, Aorta arising fixtm both Ventricles.

The pericardium was therefore cautiously dis- sected away from about the vessels of the heart, and after some time, the pulmonary artery was dis- * The particulars of this case are more fully related in the ninth volume of the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal ^ where there is an Engraving, shewing the appearance of the parts, on dissection.

106 PERFORMANCE OF THE The office of the urethra in the male is twofold; it affords a constant conveyance for the urine, when the bladder is emptied of its contents, but it has also another important duty to perform, in the occasional expulsion of the semen, and for the performance of the latter of these functions, a complex structure in the parts immediately sur- rounding the canal was required; while the only purpose of the female urethra is that of allowing the contents of the bladder to pass off, upon the natural impulse being given, for which reason the female urethra is extremely short, of very simple structure, and is capable of being dilated to a degree that, unless the fact was well authenticated, could scarcely be believed. * Should the symptoms of stone in the female re- quire the removal of the calculus, the first thing to be done is to tranquillize any irritation in the bladder by the means above pointed out, after which the urethra may be gradually dilated by the introduction of a sponge tent, until it will with ease admit the fore finger, when the calculus may be so examined as to enable the operator to judge very accurately how far further dilatation may be expedient, for the purpose of admitting the removal of the stone, or how far it may be rather * See Case 13.

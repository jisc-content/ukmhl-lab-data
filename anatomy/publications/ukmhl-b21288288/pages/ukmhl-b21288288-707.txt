M 3 ENLARGEMENT OF PROSTATE GLAND. 1808. At this time he passed his water very- well. Two hours afterward, when he again attempted to make water, he was unable to pass a drop; and he remained in this state till on the next morning his vessel reached Scarborough. The moment the anchor was in the ground, he came ashore, and sent for his surgeon, who en- deavoured to introduce an instrument, but failed. He tried the silver, as well as the flexible gum catheter, and bougies of various kinds, but all to no purpose. On the evening of August the 5th, 1 first visited him. The bladder was evidently very full, and was extremely painful. He had lost eight ounces of blood, he had taken opiates repeatedly, had been several times immersed in the warm bath, and the lower part of the abdomen had been repeatedly rubbed with camphorated and oily embrocations. It was stated that there was an obstinate stricture that could not be passed, and that it was proposed to puncture the bladder. On the morning of Saturday he had passed a little water, which had dropped away for some time pretty quickly, but soon ceased again. He was in extreme pain, from the distended state of the bladder, which formed a very obvious tumor above the pubes; and his skin was covered with a copious perspiration.

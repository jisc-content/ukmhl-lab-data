PARALYTIC AFFECTION, ScC. 84 ment in bed, had produced an attempt at inflamma- tion, which, from the deficient energy of the parts, had sunk into exhaustion and loss of vitahty. Sect. 11. Of ^adherent Calculus. It has been observed that in severe irritation of the bladder arising from gravel, the inflammatory action will occasionally proceed to such an extent as to end in effusion of coagulable lymph upon the inner membrane, and under these circumstances it is not unusual to find the calculous matter adherent to those parts upon which the effusion has taken place. Very much the same kind of thing occasion- ally takes place in affections produced by stone, in which the irritation excited either by the calculus itself, or by some other cause, is productive of an effusion of coagulable lymph, the surface of which, connecting itself with the stone, becomes the bond of union between it and the coats of the bladder. ' In one case* this event was ascertained to have taken place in consequence of irritation at the neck of the bladder, produced by injecting to cure a gonorrhsea; although it is more generally the result of the irritation excited by the stone itself. * Related by Sir E.

On enquiry he gave the following account of himself. He said he had been all his life a very regular and temperate man. Once while young, he had had, a mild gouorrhgea, which was soon cured.

He said that for the last two or three months he had found difficulty and pain in making water, and that twice within that period, he had had a retention of urine, which was relieved by proper medicines.

63 AND ITS MEMBRANES. even then effusion of blood into its substance should, as happens most commonly in the brain, assume the form of a mass more or less solid; but in the present instance there were several very thin strata of blood, all disposed parallel to each other, and transversely to the direction of the longitudi- nal fibres, supposing such to exist. The cpagula were deposited at some small dis- tance from each other, not exactly in a line, but so that estimating the probable effect of the whole, it would be that most likely to produce a complete suspension of the functions of the medulla, con- sidering it as the medium of connection between the brain, and the other parts of the body. The larger arteries of the brain were all, more or less extensively ossified. Upon laying open the cavity of the chest, the heart was found in a very diseased state. The ten- dinous margin round the insertion of each auricle was converted into a firm mass of bone. The two great coronary arteries of the heart were, from their origin behind the valves of the aorta, nearly down to the apex of the heart, completely ossified. The semilunar valves, at the mouth of the aorta, were much enlarged, and changed from their natural figure by the deposition of ossific matter within the margin of their attachment to the sides of the artery. The whole extent of the arch of the aorta was enlarged to double its natural size, and completely diseased. The inner membrane was deprived of its natural smooth structure by the progress of os-

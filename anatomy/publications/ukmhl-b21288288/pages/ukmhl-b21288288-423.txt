It appears that the most general ef- fects of this irritation, are the various appearances produced by absorption of parts, although effusion also sometimes occurs, either giving rise to a col- lection of a serous fluid, a purulent fluid, or a new secretion of ossific matter, the consequence of which is anchylosis. In Robinson's case, the appearances observed in the knee were referable to irritation alone, although it had operated to the complete removal of the na- tural structure of the crucial ligaments of the joint. In the joint of the hip, which was nearer to the seat of the disease, not only was the round liga- ment absorbed, but the cartilage had lost its natu- ral colour; and, from its striking resemblance to cartilages in other diseased joints, where I have seen commencing absorption, there can be no doubt that absorption was in this case also, on the eve of taking place. In Murray's case, the ex- citement went on, not only to the absorption of the cartilages, but also to the effusion of ossific matter; which effusion most probably takes place from the capillary arteries that carry on the circulation with- in the medullary cavities of the bones, behind the surfaces that form the articulation, as it is these arteries that furnish the ossific matter, in com- pleting the figure of the bone, during its growth.* The following case exemplifies the effects of in- * This, and several other circumstances hitherto unnoticed, relating to the process of ossification, are demonstrated in some experiments and observations that I have laid before the Medi- co-Chirurgical Society, and which are published in the sixth Volume of their Transactions.

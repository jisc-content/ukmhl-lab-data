EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. PLATE I. Fig. 1. An unusually large calculus, weighing four drachms and fifty-six grains, removed from the kidney of a nobleman after death. There were four more calculi of a smaller size in the left kidney, and eleven in the left. This calculus has been di- vided through the middle, in order to exhibit the internal appearance and arrangement of its lamina. a. a. a. Parts of the external surface of the calculus. b. b. The cut surface, shewing the composition of the stone to be principally uric acid, although in some parte apparently combined with a certain propor- tion of the phosphates. From the appearance of the section it is pi*etty evident that this calculus was originally several distinct parts, which subsequently became united together into one larger mass. r. c. Parts of the external surface rendered particularly smooth, and somewhat"^ depressed by the occasional friction vvith the smaller calculi, that were found lying in contact with it in the kidney. d. A part of the external surface, that was thinly co- vered with a deposition of the phosphates.

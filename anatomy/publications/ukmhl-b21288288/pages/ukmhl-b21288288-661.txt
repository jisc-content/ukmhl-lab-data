STRICTURE IN THE RECTUM. 119 I 4 lour was a red or mottled brown, in lio part crowd- ed with vessels. At the upper part of the abdomen, connecting the stomach to the colon, was the omentum com* pletely diseased. The whole of the omentum was exceedingly contracted in its dimensions, but was rendered extremely thick. To the touch, it felt like a cartilaginous substance. The disease in this part was irregularly tuberculated, and when cut into, the small honeycomb spaces between the membranous septa, were in some parts filled with a matter resembling cream, in others with a sub- stance of more firm consistence. The general structure of the stomach exactly resembled that of the intestines. At the pyloric orifice, upon that side next the less curvature of the stomach a very extensive scirrhus disease was found. The scirrhus when divided was more than half an inch thick, and it is curious that the affection' was entirely confined to the one side of the circle of the pylorus. The villous coat of the stomach was entire, but more vascular than in its natural state. The dis- ease seemed to have left the peritoneal coat of all the viscera unaffected. The lower part of the rectum presented the largest mass of disease. At the upper part of the pelvis, this intestine was firmly fixed to the spine and sacrum by a very extensive tliickening of parts around the gut, the coats of which were com-

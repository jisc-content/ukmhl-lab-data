472 ON DlSLpCATION- vant, and made to stand upon a post, from wliich her foot slipt. She did not fall, but was so much hurt, that when set down, she could not walk a step, and was therefore carried home. She com- plained only of the knee, and cried all night with the pain. Her aunt with whom she lived, terrified with her screams, sent for her mother the next morning. Still her complaint was in the knee only, and as there was nothing to be seen about the joint, it was supposed of no consequence. The knee was rubbed with an embrocation, and she was kept in bed, by which means, in the course of a month, she was able to limp about a little. Still the affection appeared to be confined en- tirely to the knee, but as the child was observed to be unable to place her heel to the ground in walking, her "father said he was sure something must have happened, although the child, threatened by the servant, was afraid to own it, and the ser- vant herself persisted in denying it stoutly; how- ever, as the father was clear the child had suffered some violence, she was carried to a surgeon, six weeks after the accident. The joint was examined, and the opinion given, was, that the hip was dis- located, but that from the relaxed and delicate state of the paits, it was probable the luxation might have been produced by the slightest cause. It was also stated that the thigh bone could not now ever be returned into its proper place, for that it was too late even to attempt such reduction. She was, however, directed to bathe in the sea.

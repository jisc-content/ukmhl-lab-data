AFFECTIONS OF THE BRAIN 62 of the cerebrum, that of the cerebellum had not undergone a similar change. Removing that portion of the cerebellum, which forms the posterior part of the fourth ventricle, several small coagula of blood were observed, lying upon the opposite side of the ventricle, on the pos- terior surface of the medulla oblongata. To as- certain the precise extent of this extravasation, the medulla oblongata was removed from its situation, and divided by a vertical section, carried from be- hind, forward. This section exhibited several thin strata of blood, approaching to a state of coagul- ation. The disposition of these extrasavations of blood was remarkable. Many circumstances in the ana- tomy of the brain favor the idea that the medulla oblongata is made up of a congeries of longitudinal fibres. This appears evidently the case, when some parts of its surface are observed with atten- tion. On this supposition, however, it is not easy to understand upon what principle the blood escap- ing from its vessels could have disposed itself, as it was found in this case. Where the blood is poured out into a muscular structure, it is known to separate, but very rarely if ever to rupture, the fibres, and the same rule might be expected, in some degree at least, to apply to other fibrous matter ; but should it, on the other hand, be taken for granted, that the medulla is merely a soft elastic matter, formed without any particular or essential arrangement^ of its particles,

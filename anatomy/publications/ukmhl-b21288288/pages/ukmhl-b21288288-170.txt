It appears that the most constant symptoms of the first stage of inflammatory affection in the larynx are, a sense of pain or uneasiness about the thyroid cartilage ; considerable dyspnoea, the cause of which is referred by the patient to the larynx ; and symptoms of fever, the form and de- gree of which will be regulated by the state of constitution. During this period of the complaint, the utmost vigilance will be required, in order that the favora- ble moment for preventing the complete establish- ment of the disease, may not be allowed to pass. Every means by which the circulation is capable of being lowered, should be instantly had recourse to, with a view to diminish, first quantity, and then action." Bleeding, both general and local, will therefore pave the way to blisters, and the subsequent exhibition of the various diaphoretic and antispasmodic medicines. But for want of early attention to these means of relief, or perhaps, notwithstanding their prompt application, the dyspnoea may still go on increasing every hour, producing the most distressing anxiety and risk of suffocation, with occasional delirium.

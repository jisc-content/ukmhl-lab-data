OF THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. 409 â€¢ over the whole of the hand and wrist, with severe, deep-seated pain. She was directed to apply a warm poultice of linseed meal and fresh water twice -a day, which at the end of a week she thought had afforded her some relief. The application was then changed to linseed meal mixed with cold sea water, changed twice a day for a fortnight longer, when a little purulent matter appeared, by a small open- ing just over the situation of the radial artery of the wrist; the quantity, however, was so trifling that it afforded no relief. On comparing the effects of the two applications, it appeared, that the warm poultice always pro- duced some degree of immediate, but temporary relief; but that when the cold sea water poultice was wrapped round the parts, they became numbed and deprived of all feeling for the space of ten minutes, after which they always recovered, ac- quiring a genial glow of heat, and this usually became so considerable, that previous to the re- moval of the poultice, the steam might be seen to fly off from the surface of the poultice, which felt warm to the hand. As often as the sea water poultice was applied, it gave a sensation of binding, or tightness to the parts, as if the skin had been drawn tight round the wrist.' But although there was some ground for considering this poultice a stimulating appli- cation, the feehngs of the parts were perfectly natural, the skin continuing to look clear and well. Subsequent to the small opening taking place, the real state of the parts still remained obscure.

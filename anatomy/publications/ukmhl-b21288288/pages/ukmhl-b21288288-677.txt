SITUATION AND STRUCTURE, &C. 135 belong to one and the same disease, than to the ^ progress of affections specifically differing from each other. The prostate gland is not one entire body, but a substance made up of several parts. The largest portions of the gland are placed laterally, one on each side of the canal of the urethra ; and the ante- rior margins of these portions surrounding the superior part of the urethra, -meet each other, and are connected together. Posteriorly, between the two lateral lobes, and immediately behind the mem- brane lining the neck of the bladder, is a smaller lobe, which, although it has long been known as the occasional seat of disease, has never until lately been demonstrated in its healthy state. * Â« Sect. 2. On the Causes and Appearances of Disease in the Prostate Gland. Affections of the prostate gland are very rarely found to occur until after the age of 60 years. Pre- vious to that period, either from the disturbance excited by strictures in the urethra, or from the im- proper management of gonorrhaea, a temporary affection of this part has occasionally taken place, but the occurrence is not common. * By Sir E.

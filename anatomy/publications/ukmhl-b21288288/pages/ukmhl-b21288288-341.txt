321 MALFORMATION OF THE ANUS. quently. Tt was intended, in this instance, to have formed an enlarged and adequate orifice by the use of bougies, or such other means as might have been necessary; but the mother, both ignorant and obstinate, was not to be prevailed upon to allow any thing more being done on the child's behalf. The infant went on tolerably well for about six months, although the enlargement of the abdomen continued to increase. He subsequently became poorly, and died. The body was not examined. In 1815, I was requested * to examine the body of a young woman, aged seventeen, who had died from scrofulous disease, and who from birth had evacuated her stools by the vagina; although there was in this case no want of power of retention. On examination, there was an external mark in the natural situation of the anus, but no opening. Upon laying open the abdomen, the intestine rectum was traced down to the posterior part of the vagina, to which it was adherent. The vagina being removed and laid open, the intestine was found to open upon its surface, by a very vascular and prominent sort of papilla, situated within the vagina, near the os externum. * By Dr. Merriraan.

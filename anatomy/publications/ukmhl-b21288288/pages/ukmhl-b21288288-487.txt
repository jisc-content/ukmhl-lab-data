AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. 465 Case 120. Dislocated Shoulder. â–  In November 1811, a poor woman aged sixty, of a spare habit of body, fell down and pat out her left shoulder. She said she was subject to fits, and that the same thing had repeatedly occurred before, but that till this time she had always been able to get it in without assistance. Observed from the front, and compared with the other shoulder, it did not appear deficient in roundness, or materially al- tered in form. On closer examination however, the head of the bone was found to have retired from its proper situation, and was felt more protuberant than natural behind the joint, just below-the spine of the scapula. I endeavoured immediately to press the humerus into its place, but the muscles of the sca- pula held it flist. The patient was then set upon the bed, and an assistant on the floor extending the arm while I drew the scapula steadily in the oppo- site direction,, at the same time firmly pressing the head of the bone forwards, and the neck of the scapula backwards. In a few moments the head of the humerus was distinctly heard as well as felt to spring suddenly over the projecting margin of the articulation, back into the glenoide cavity; she said she found immediate relief from much paia. She complained of pain and tenderness about the joint where the capsular ligament had been most severely strained, but this went off spontaneously by keeping the arm in a sling for a few days. H II

276 ON SOME AFFECTIONS OF THE The external wound was very near the anterior spine of the ileum, and this opening led on to a small fistulous passage through the abdominal pa- rietes, into a large depending cavity. The pa- rietes of the abdomen were next divided from the orifice, upward and downward; the adhesions being separated, they were turned aside. By these means a large tumor was brought into view. This tumor was a considerably thickened and indurated mass, connected extensively by adhesion to all the neighbouring parts. It proved to be the caecum, with the ileum passing into it and the colon. The whole of this diseased bag was dis- sected out, and being removed from the body, was laid open from the small orifice by which it had bui^t through the parietes of the abdomen. A large diseased cavity was now exposed, full of ul- cerations ; in many parts intersected by mem- branous septa, or bridles, and every where greatly indurated. Within the cyst was found a consider- able quantity of common plum and cherry-stones, a large handful at least. Upon more careful examination it appeared that the sac was chiefly made up of the bulbous extre- mity of the colon, denominated caecum, and here the extraneous bodies had collected themselves. The extremity of the colon next the disease was greatly contracted and thickened. The extremity of the ileum was ulcerated, but considerably dilated, and remarkably thin in many places. The valve of the colon was very much thickened and diseased. Its lower margin or lip was eroded by ulceration. 4

It is in this case as well as in the more advanced stages of the permanent stricture that the applica- tion of, caustic has been recommended; and where the circumstances of the case are suited to the treat- ment it certainly becomes an invaluable remedy; but it is a remedy that sometimes very materially in-' volves the future comfort of the patient, on which account it should never be hastily determined on. The escharotic applications in present use are the lunar caustic, and the caustic vegetable alkali. As to the particular manner of employing these substances, the lunar caustic is applied by letting a small piece into the point of a wax bougie, which being passed down to the seat of the affection, is pressed against the stTicture for the space of a mi- nute, so as to produce a superficial eschar. The caustic alkali is used much in the same way, but in a much smaller piece, for the intention here is the complete solution of the whole quantity of caustic introduced; in which case the caustic forms a fluid, that is diffused over the strictured part of the canal, and is found to diminish spasm, although it does not operate with the same local severity as the lunar caustic, by destroying the parts touched'. Now, although the simple bougie is liable to do harm by bringing on or increasing irritability in the

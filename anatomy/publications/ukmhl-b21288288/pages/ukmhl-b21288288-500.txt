476 ON DISLOCATION cumstances, the irritation and strain of the liga- ment, if the constitutional powers were tolerably good, must have been productive of the same results that have been already explained in re- ference to dislocated shoulder. ^ It may indeed be objected, that the capsular ligaments even of the large joints, are but very thin membranes, in which case how can it be supposed that the secretion of a mass of ossific matter ten times the thickness of such membrane, can be deposited within its interstitial or cellular struc- ture ? To answer this point, we must first en- quire whether the state of the capsule is not pre- viously changed? and if so, in what this change consists? I have in many instances examined diseased joints after death, in which the capsular ligaments have exhibited the appearances proper to the various stages of inflammatory action ; and in all these cases fluid matter more or less coagu- lable was foun4 poured out by the x^apillary arteries into the interstices of the ligamentous structure, and in exact proportion to the quantity and con- sistence of this effused matter, was the apparent thickness and firmness - of the capsular ligament. By these means the capsule is rendered in some instances a quarter of an inch, in others half an inch, and in one case in particular, it was three quarters of an inch in thickness. Admitting this previous state of parts, it be- comes no longer diflicult to perceive how the ves- sels from the bone shooting into the newly orga- nized adventitious matter in the membrane may

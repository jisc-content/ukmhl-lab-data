452 ON DISEASE IN THE warm bath ; it seemed to aggravate the inflamma- tory disposition, and a third abscess formed above the inner ancle, which opened through one of the old wounds. The discharge from the outer ancle, was also much increased by this fresh attack, and she found herself more seriously ill upon this, than any for- mer occasion, but with the assistance of warm bread and milk poultices, and rest, she was in the course of a month, very materially relieved. With a degree of patience, reflecting infinite credit upon the managers of that useful Institution, she was allowed three months to recruit her health, and in September, she commenced bathing in the open sea. The immersion was repeated three times a week, and in general respects, agreed very well. She still, however, felt the same peculiar sense of fulness and tension about the ancle joint on the bathing days, as before ; but it was not fol- lowed by inflammation. The cold bath, almost completely succeeded in restoring her constitu- tional health. During the use of the cold bath, the dressings were simple ointment, and occasion- ally a fomentation with warm sea water, from which she said, she found'great comfort. The bathing was continued up to November, when she returned to town. Increased uneasiness and pain were the first con- sequences of the fatigue of her journey up to Lon- don, -where she was again admitted into St. George's Hospital. She was first directed some saturnine lotion, with the ung. hydr. nitrat. rub. for a dressing.

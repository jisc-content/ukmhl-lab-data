4 INFLAMMATORY AFFECTION, &C. iiie state of the urine, or proved by the past experi- ence of the patient, as to the complaints to which he may have been subject. The most curious derangement that occasionally takes place in the actions of the kidney, appears to be that peculiar and astonishing increase in its secreting power, which constitutes diabetes. The pathology of this disease is still very imperfectly un- derstood, but if we may be allowed to estimate the value of a theory by its success when applied to practice, that seems to be the best which attributes the diabetes mellitis to a peculiar derangement in the state of the digestive organs, which operates by favouring the too abundant evolution of those prin- ciples which furnish the kidneys with the elements of the saccharine matter, which we know is secreted in most cases of diabetes in large quantity. The particular consideration of this complaint, however, falls more immediately within the province of phy- sic than surgery. Sect. 3. On Calculous Affections of the Kidnej/. Of the morbid affections of the secreting vessels of the kidney, one of the most common is a disposi- tion to evolve a concrete, or calculous matter. This deviation from the healthy action of the kidney manifests itself by the appearance of the urine, in

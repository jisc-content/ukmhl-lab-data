124 SINGULARLY LARGE CALCULUS, &C. seems the phosphates were deposited, according to the accidental figure of each of the little masses of tenacious mucus.* My having lately seen a very interesting ac- countt of a calculus of extraordinary size that was voided under much the same circumstances, has operated as an inducement to bring forward the above particulars, as it appears to me that the ' two cases together form an exceedingly curious and striking parallel. Case 14. Diseased Urinary Bladder, In September 1809, a woman in the 52d year of' her age died in the Infirmary belonging to St. George's workhouse. She had been long in a very infirm state of bodily health, and her menta) faculties had almost entirely failed.

At length the abscess quite healed, his consti- tutional strength exhausted, and his limb useless, he was carried in a chair down to the warm springs, and bathed regularly. When the painful and irri- table state of the shoulder had become sufficient- ly quiet to admit of examination, the disease was ascertained to have terminated in anchylosis. The elbow joint also was found to be nearly as immove- able as the shoulder ; but the rigidity of the mus- cles, it was hoped, might by degrees be removed, and he was therefore very judiciously put upon a regular course of action for the fore-arm, by which he eventually recovered its use. The baths were continued every second day for many weeks, and these he found very instrumental in relieving him from the remaining pains about the shoulder, and in forwarding the improvement of his health. Subsequent to his recovery, the arm remained extremely emaciated, particularly about the shoul- der ; it appeared, in fact, completely stripped of its muscular coverings.

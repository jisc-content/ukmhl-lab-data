78 DISAPPEARANCE OF THE These are very curious facts, and they appear to me not to have met with the attention they deserve. It has been stated ah'eady, that an alkaline mat- ter received into the circulation of the blood, has the power of preventing the separation of an excess of the opposite, or acid principle, by the kidneys. Here then, we have unquestionably an instance, in the living system, of an operation regulated entirely by the known laws of chemical affinity; and I be- lieve that in the relief afforded by the use of alkalies in stone, the agency of the same laws may be clearly traced much further. The genius, and researches, of one of the most distinguished physiologists of the present or perhaps of any age *, led him to this bold conclusion, that theblood, although a fluid, seeingthat it undoubtedly contains the elements of all living matter, is in itself possessed of a living principle, that its spontaneous coagulation should be considered as a proof of its possessing a vital power, and consequently, that blood recently coagulated may be regarded as still alive. Now it appears to me, that agreeable to these principles, the gelatin or fibrin of the recent coagu- lum of blood may be considered as very nearly parallel to the muscular fibre, or gelatin that is al- ready deposited, or laid down in the various struc- tures of'the body, and that the same measure of * Mr. John Hunter.

IN THE RECTURf. 307 bladder still remained. With a view to the relief of these complaints an issue was opened in the thigh; in three weeks however, it appeared to have effected nothing, and was therefore allowed to. dry up. Her general health graduallv improved, but her local complaints did not. She therefore applied for admission into the St. George's Infirmary in De- cember 1811. The complaints now e^iisting were considered to arise more from constitutional, than local circumstances, and upon this principle medi- cines were directed. On examination, a contrac- tion was found in the rectum ; situated about two inches within the sphinctor ani. It was apparently a narrow membranous circle, not materially, if at all, connected with disease or contraction of the muscular coat of the intestine. It felt more like an affection of the mucous membrane alone. The finger was without difficulty passed through the stricture, but the examination produced great dis- tress, with symptoms of hysteria. This seemed to be a very fair case for the trial of caustic, and I have no doubt the plan would have cured her, but she would not submit to its application. Repeated experiment proved the irritability of the parts was much too high to admit of her deriving any advan- tage from the use of the unarmed bougie. She therefore, in a few weeks, left the Infirmary, with- out being materially relieved.

Under this thickening a passage was eroded through from the caecum into the colon. This contracted part formed a bridge over a cavity, which, on cutting through this bridge, was found to contain three or four fruit stones, such as were in the caecum. From a consideration of the above case, together with the appearances on dissection, it seems more than a probability, that the extraneous substances had lodged at first in the c^cum, having afterward made a way under, and between the villous and the cellular coats of the colon, or rather, the fruit stones had accumulated behind, or on the caecal side of the inferior segment of the valve of the colon; and as the number increased, this part of the valve had been pushed out into a sort of bag, which had at last burst into the great intestine. An extremely rare case now and then occurs, in which the bowels are subjected to the whole extent of evil that commonly arises from hernia, without this infirmity having in reality taken place. The two following cases will set the matter in a more clear point of view.

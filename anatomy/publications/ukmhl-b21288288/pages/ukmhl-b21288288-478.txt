456 ON DISEASE IN THE upon the foot, it was so prone to turn aside, as to be scarcely adequate, with painful exertion, to sup- port any considerable weight. She, however, left the house, and worked about on it as well as she could, for three months, when it became so much weaker, that she was under the necessity of again applying for assistance. An in- strument of iron was now made for her, to operate as a stay and support for the articulation. There was a joint opposite the ancle, and a laced boot below, into which the foot was secured. The ap- paratus was fitted to the outside of the leg, and just above the ancle, a strap passed round the tibia, so as to confine the bearing of the bone nearly to a parallel line with that of the foot in its natural position. This contrivance answered the purpose very well, and she continued to wear it, till the boot was worn out; although she sometimes seemed to consider the instrument an hindrance, rather than an assistance to her, in walking. In May 1818, four years after the accident, I met her walking exceedingly well, without even a stick. She said, she found her ancle strong enough to allow of her walking more than four miles out and back the same day, without inconvenience. The joint however was still weak, but having re- covered much of its strength, was not so liable to give way as it was formerly. * * Plate 6. Fig. 3.

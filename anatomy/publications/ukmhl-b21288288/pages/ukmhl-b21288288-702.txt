160 ON THE FREQUENCY, &C. case; this being the only means at present known, by which the activity of the circulation through the kidneys may be restored. The length of the interval which may with pro- priety be allowed to pass between the periods at which the patient's water is drawn off, will depend very principally upon the state of the bladder. In those cases where the bladder has never before been subject to disease, possessing its natural power of relaxation, the introduction of the catheter will not usually be necessary oftener than twice a day. Where, however, on the contrary, the history and symptoms of the disease shew that the bladder has in time past been affected with extreme irritation, and perhaps inflammation, and that the patient ever since that period has been in the habit of passing his water at short intervals, the additional difficulty produced by the affection of the prostate gland will require the catheter to be passed with a frequency conformable as nearly as may be, to the acquired habit of action in the bladder, probably every six or four hours, or still more often. Under these cir- cumstances there will be every reason to believe the bladder has suffered more or less of permanent con- traction, the degree of which contraction may be in general pretty accurately estimated by the quantity of urine usually passed at a time, previous to the commencement of the more recent affection of the prostate gland.

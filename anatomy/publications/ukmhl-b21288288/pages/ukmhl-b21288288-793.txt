Where the canal of the urethra had suffered m- flammation and distention behind the strictures, coagulable lymph had been efflised, and the particles of uric gravel had become adherent through the whole extent of the effused lymph. The fistulous orifice where the urethra had burst, was situated immediately behind the strictured part of the canal. ^ The prostate gland was considerably enlarged, and had an extensive abscess formed within its substance. * * See appearance of the Bladder, Plate 3.

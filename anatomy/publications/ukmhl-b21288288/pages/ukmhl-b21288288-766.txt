^24> SPASMODIC STRICTURE. ever this pain was very severe, he found that his urine passed in a diminished current, although at other times he thought it flowed freely enough. I requested he would allow me to pass a bougie into the bladder to ascertain whether there was any obstruction forming j to this he agreed, and a bougie of full size was introduced, when a stricture was found at six inches from the external orifice. The ob- struction however was easily passed with a bougie of smaller diameter, and by repeating the operation at regular intervals, and gradually increasing the size of the instrument, the urethra was so fairly re- laxed that in the course of six weeks he felt no inconvenience from a full sized bougie being passed forward into the bladder; neither was he any longer subject to those uneasy sensations, and spasmodic affections, that had previously been a source of dis- tress to him, as often as the parts were called upon to perform their natural actions. Case 23. Spasmodic Stricture. J. Davis, a very hard working man, a lamp- lighter, aged 35 years, applied for assistance to the St. George's Infirmary in May 1810. In his ac- count of his complaints he said that as long as nine years before, he had experienced the first attack of stoppage in his water subsequent to great fatigue.

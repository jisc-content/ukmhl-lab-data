I EXTERNAL TO THE BRAIN. 41 adhesive plaster, covered with a light bandage. By the next day, however, the central slip of integu- ments had become tumid from inflammation j and as in swelling it had increased materially in breadth and thickness, it had in the same proportion de- creased in length, so as to be considerably shortened. Under these circumstances, the confinement of the parts had nearly frustrated one of the principal objects of the operation. The central slip had shifted from behind the dressings, although still somewhat confined by the upper edge of the slips of adhesive plaster. In this wrong situation it had already formed an union by the first intention, in a position nearly horizontal; and had this union been allowed to become confirmed, there would have ' been in effect no central shp to look to for assist- ance in the remaining operations. These points being sufficiently apparent, 1 imme- diately removed the bandage and plasters, and then gently pressing the central slip between my finger and thumb, gave it a sufficient degree of motion la- terally to disengage it from its recent adhesions. A little bleeding followed. Merely for the sake of protecting it from external harm, a very light bandage was so adjusted round the head and face as to cover the parts, without being even in con- tact with the central slip, which it was very clear had better be left to itself. For about ten days the divided end of the bone looked dark and foul, but within a fortnight it became clean, was covered with granulations, and soon after perfectly healed.

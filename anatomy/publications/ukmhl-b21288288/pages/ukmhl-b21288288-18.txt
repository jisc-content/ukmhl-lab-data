AFFECTIONS OF PARTS 4 Why, for example, as in the above case, should the slow growth of a small tumor in the scalp, ever be productive of severe paroxysms of pain in the head, and an almost total loss of vision ? Can the increase of circulation necessary for the support of so inconsiderable a swelling, afford any satisfac- tory solution ? Certainly not, for the vascularity is absolutely trifling. Can the nervous sensibility of such a tumor be brought forward as a plausible reason ? Scarcely, for in the above case no degree of pressure produced the least sensation in the part, much less any pain. Tumors of this description most frequently arise from some accidental violence, as a blow. The following seems to be the pathology of such cases. Where a blow has been inflicted, a serous effusion to some small extent into the cells of the cellular membrane is the first eflect produced. This effu- sion, which in ordinary ch'cumstances would only temporarily obstruct its own free percolation from cell to cell, cannot now make its way so readily, by reason of the adhesive inflammation having taken place, forming a boundary to the extent of the efili- sion J and while the accumulation of fluid continues to go on, increasing pressure, requiring increase of support, the membranous texture containing the fluid assumes new characters, and by a slow change is at length converted into a condensed and fii-m struc- ture, which eventually becomes the cyst j the law by which this is provided, being one and the same, whatever variation may occur in the scale of its operation.

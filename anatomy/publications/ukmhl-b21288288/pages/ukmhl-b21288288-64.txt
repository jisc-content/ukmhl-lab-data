48 AFFECTIONS OF THE BRAIN given way were situated in the substance of the brain, immediately below the lateral ventricles. Part of tlie effused blood had made its way down into the third, and even the fourth ventricle, and in both these cavities grumous and coagulated blood was found. Even beyond the fourth ven- tricle the blood had made its way to some distance down upon the surface of the medulla spinalis. It is difficult to determine upon the probable quantity of blood, by which, in this instance, the brain had been overwhelmed. Those gentlemen who were present at the dissection, concurred in the opinion, that there could not have been less than from eight to ten ounces. Case 16.* Sanguineous Apoplexy. A woman, about 40 years of age, and of a thin habit of body, fell down in an apoplectic fit. She was much bruised by the fall, and upon being raised up, was found to have entirely lost the use of her right side, which she never afterwards recovered. She was soon after the accident taken to an hos- pital. Her eyes were very black, with extensive ecchymosis down both sides of her face, from the bruise received in falling. On examination, there was no wound upon the head. She was perfectly sensible, but had completely lost the use both of the arm and leg upon the right side. The power of directing the motions of the right eye also was much impaired. * Extracted from a MS. in Mr, Heaviside's Museum.

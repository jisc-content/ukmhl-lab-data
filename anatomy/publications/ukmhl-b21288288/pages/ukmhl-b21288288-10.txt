DEDICATION. iv These are obligations of no ordinary cha- racter, and as their extent forbids all hope of return, you must at least allow me thus to express some sense of their value. Permit me Sir, to place under your pro- tection the following work, which, if it has any merit, derives it entirely from the example you have uniformly set before me, in the most diligent and humane attention to every professional duty. That you may long continue to live in the enjoyment of the professional con- fidence, and private regard, of a very nume- rous and distinguished circle of friends, is the sincere wish of Dear Sir, Your ever affectionate Friend, and much obliged humble Servant, JOHN HOWSHIP. Mill-Street, Hanover Square, October, 15, 1816.

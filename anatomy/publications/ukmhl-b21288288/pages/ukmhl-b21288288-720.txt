J 78 ' STRUCTURE AND rUNCTlONS considerable power, which are subservient to the purposes of generation; as well as from several ligamentous expansions by which it is more imme- diately connected to the symphysis pubis. Upon laying open the cavity of the urethra we see that its internal appearance varies, conformably to the particular office assigned to each part of the canal. At the neck of the bladder it is of a pale yellow colour, and it has much the same appearance where it passes through the prostate gland, and re- ceives the seminal ducts. Just beyond this, at the membranous part, the canal becomes smaller, and from being more freely supplied with red blood, it assumes a dark red colour. Immediately before the membranous part, the canal, for the space of two inches, becomes much more relaxed and capacious, and the inner membrane still more vascular, form- ing what has been termed the bulb of the urethra. Anterior to the bulb the diameter and vascularity of the canal are again reduced, so that the colour of the inner membrane appears comparatively pale. These appearances in the healthy urethra corres- pond exactly to the functions allotted to the differ- ent parts of the canal. We know that, as a general rule, the sensibility and irritability of parts bear a certain proportion to the vascularity; and upon this principle there would be no difficulty in determin- ing, from the appearance of the parts, that the most irritable points in the urethra must be bulbous and

Poultices and fomentations brought the matter speedily forward ; and in three days the skin gave way, when an astonishing dis- charge of matter took place. From the quick progress of the inflammation, and the point at which the abscess had opened, there was much reason to fear the lachrymal sac must have been involved in the mischief.

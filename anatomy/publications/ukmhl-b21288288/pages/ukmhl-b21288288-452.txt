ON DISEASE IN THE 4S0 ed to mend. She got about, first on crutches, and afterward with a stick only. Her appetite improv- ed, and she was able, not only to bear upon the limb, but also to move about the neighbourhood occasionally. In January 1813, a degree of redness, with heat and increased pain, attacked the external part of the knee, just above the joint. It was poulticed and fomented for several weeks, when matter ap- peared, and the skin gave way : the discharge was trifling, but the abscess continued open. She thought herself better able to move about on her leg now than before. All the following summer she remained tolerably well, and was able to walk two or three miles a day comfortably, with a stick only. On the approach of winter, however, she found her leg worse ; the stiffness in the limb being greater, and the power of motion less. It became tender, heated, and painful, just above the little opening that remained, consequent to the first gathering; and after two months poulticing matter came forward, and two more openings formed rather above the first. A fresh inflammation now commenced, as high up as the middle of the thigh, upon the posterior part of the limb, and this continued increasing till March 1814 when it broke, and discharged much more in quantity, and was attended with more relief than either of the former abscesses. Previous to this abscess bursting, she had been confined to her bed, but on its opening she had improved, and was able to move about the house tolerably well.

OP THE BRAIN. depression, fracture, or fissure, to bear out this sup- position. The spicule of bone was situated ex- actly against that part of the dura mater which was adherent to the brain. The plexus choroides on each side contained a small, soft, whitish tumor, the size of a hempseed; these had the feel of scrofulous enlarged glands. The ventricles were by no means loaded with fluid ; on the contrary, they contained less than is gene- rally found. The pineal gland contained an earthy or calca- reous matter. Every other part of the brain was examined, without any appearance of disease being found. The contents of the chest were perfectly sound. In the abdomen, the only pecuhar appearance was an increase in the vascularity of the peritoneum lining the cavity of the pelvis. The haemorrhoidal vessels upon the rectum were not more numerous than common, nor disposed, as they were exter- nally, to form varicose tumors. The lower part of the temporal artery was ex- posed, and being opened, a probe was passed gently up ; and this, without the least obstruction, passed out through the divided opening in the vessel. The artery was next laid open, and by this means it was proved that there had been no form- ation of coagulum; the haemorrhage, therefore that appeared at his death, arose from the imperl fectly adherent sides of the artery giving way. From the above examination it appeared, that the principal, and perhaps the only peculiarity, ia

AFFECTIONS OF PARTS 14 In a few days however, assisted by poultices and fomentations, the swelHng upon the right side had burst, and discharged freely. On examination with a probe, the angle of the jaw was felt bare, and it was expected would soon exfoliate. The suppuration continued, and in a few days more a small scale of bone came away. Three days after the abscess on the right cheek had broke, that upon the left side of the face gave way and discharged moderately, but this had been from the first less swelled, and less painful than the swelling on the opposite side. In a few days an exfoliated scale of bone came away from the left side. Such was the rapidity of progress in this case, that in three weeks from the first of the attack, both the abscesses were healed. Ten days Subse- quent to this, the cicatrix on the right cheek gave way, having suffered a second attack of inflamma- tion, as violent as the first. It now discharged freely for the space of a w^eek, when it finally healed. The abscess that had existed upon the left cheek, did not ulcerate a second time. These complaints were treated in the Westmin- ster Infirmary, where, partly on account of the swelling still remaining upon the face, but princi- pally from the weak and deficient state' of his con- stitutional health, he remained an in-patient for more than two years afterwards. Subsequent to this remote period he had always enjoyed good health, but had not ever been able to move his jaws, even in the least degree.

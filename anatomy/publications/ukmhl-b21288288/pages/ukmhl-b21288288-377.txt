There still remained a part of the tumor formed by the uterus, which was very tense, and evidently contained a fluid. A longitudinal incision was, therefore, nÂ«xt made along the whole course of the uterus, extending through tlie os uteri and vagina. This gave discharge to one pound more of menstrual blood. The uterus, now quite flaccid and empty, the internal part was examined, to see if there was any communication with the aforesaid cavity, but none was discovered. The uterus was slightly scirrhous in its texture, and tuberculated. In the inside of the uterus there were many blind pouches, formed by du- plicatures of the internal membrane. The openings of the Fallopian tubes into the uterus were much enlarged. The bladder was very much contracted, and adherent from inflammation to the uterus, but this circumstance had not been productive of any retention of urine. * * Plate 5. Fig.l.

It may be effected by the introduction of an adequate piece of firm dry sponge into the whole depth of the wound, and as this absorbs the moisture, it will continue to swell, until the bleed- ing subsides. It is however necessary to recollect that when the tent is subsequently removed, the bladder should be carefully examined, to ascertain that no coagulum of blood be left within its cavity. After the operation a simple pledgit may be placed over the wound, and retained in its place by the T bandage. The patient may then be laid in bed either upon his back or on his side, with his thighs closed, and a large opiate should be given. Some care will be necessary in so disposing folded cloths and blankets upon the bed, as to receive the urine which flows by the wound, with as little exposure as possible to the chance of the patient's taking cold from the constant state of moisture of the parts; from the neglect of this precaution I have known an instance in which a severe cold came on, presently followed by inflammation of the peritoneum, and the patient died. Inflammation of the bladder, extending itself to the membrane lining the cavity of the abdomen, forms one of the most serious dangers to be guarded against, subsequent to the performance of this

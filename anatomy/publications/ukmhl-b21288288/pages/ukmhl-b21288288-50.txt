31< AFFECTIONS OF PARTS received, and this in a little time became more decidedly manifest. The child improved, but slowly; and when, after some weeks, she had par- tially recovered some power of motion, it was perceived that the left side was completely paraly- tic. The insensibility remained, and for the first six weeks there were frequent attacks of con- vulsion. Almost four months passed before the child was sufficiently restored to be observant of what passed around her; and long after this she re- mained exceedingly weak. She was in the third year of her age before she could stand unsupported ; and even then, all the weight was evidently laid upon the right leg, the left having scarcely any power. Subsequent to this period her strength and health gradually improved, but at the age of four years the left side was still deficient, both in heat and strength, while the opening in the cranium re- mained undiminished. Upon laying the hand on the part, the pulsations of the brain were felt strong and distinct. The feel was much the same through the integuments, as if so much of the skull had been carefully taken out with a saw. The margin of the opening did not seem thickened, but felt smooth and equal. The defect was not at this time attended with any material inconvenience, nor productive of pain. Whenever the child coughed or cried, the part became tense, so as to form an evident swell- ing : but in other respects she seemed to be pretty well recovered.

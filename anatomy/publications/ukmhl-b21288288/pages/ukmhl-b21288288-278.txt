26o ON SOME AFFECTIONS OF THE vice, a great quantity of unwholesome food is eaten, which in general proves the exciting cause of the disease, the reason is obvious enough. The increased discharges always poured into the bowels \<^here excitement proceeds from the acrimony of contents, powerfully tend to keep in check the vio- lence of the inflammatory action. In the one case the inflammation may be considered idiopa- thic, in the other symptomatic; in the former, the bowels are generally quiet, in the latter almost con- stantly more or less disturbed, with copious eva- cuations by stool. In cases of dysenteric affection, where the intes- tines have suffei'fed extensively from inflammation and ulceration of the villous coat, the patient may be very long distressed by an obstinate irritability of the bowels, so that there shall be a constant diarrhaea, or the strongest propensity to it. This arises from the excessive irritability of the recently cicatrized parts of the general surface. But dys- enteric complaints are productive of other evils more serious. The animal machine, in order to be kept up, requires a certain quantity of support, and if this is not supplied, it fails, sooner or later. It signifies nothing to the general oeconomy, whether the fault is in the stomach, or in the in- testines, or any where else. .^The following case will, in some measure, illus^ trate these observations.

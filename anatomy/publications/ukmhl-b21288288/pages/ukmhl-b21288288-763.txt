SPASMODIC STRICTURE. I passed a bougie of moderate size, and a yield- ing obstruction, which as the instrument passed through it gave much pain, was perceived six inches from the external orifice. It was however over- come by a pressure not more than equal to an ounce weight. Much pain continued to be felt at the part where the contraction had taken place, for the minute that the bougie was allowed to remain in the urethra. On withdrawing the instrument he was desired to see if he could pass his urine, he made the at- tempt and succeeded in getting rid of about an ounce, but it flowed in a very contracted stream, the close of the act was attended with straining, and a few drops of blood followed. He said he had now passed his water not only more copiously, but with much less pain, than at any time since the attack. In the course of his walk from the hospital to the barracks, up a steep hill, he repeatedly experienced an inclination to pass his water, which each time flowed with more freedom than before. The night before he had been up nine times, but the night fol- lowing the introduction of the bougie he was up only twice, and the night after this again, he was not disturbed at all, the symptoms having entirely left him. On making a second examination with the bougie, a few days afterward, the canal was found free from any obstruction, and the stream of urine was apparently as large as ever.

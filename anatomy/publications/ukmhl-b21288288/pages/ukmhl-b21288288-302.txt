Case 83. Hcemon'hage from the Villous Coat of the Intestines. Mary Robinson, the wife of a sailor, aged forty- two, was attacked June the 1st, 1811, with a severe vomiting of blood, which had been produced by a sudden fright. She had been at sea for several voyages, and some time previous to the present attack, had been affected with jaundice and pain in the side. When she came into the St. George's Infirmary, on the 4th of June, the bleeding had entirely disappeared ; but she had frequent cough, with sickness and vomiting. Her nights were restless and painful. She sometimes even screamed out from the violence of pain down the sides of the abdomen, and about the navel. When re- ceived into the house, there was also a dropsical en- largement of the abdomen, and this continued to increase till Saturday, August the 10th, when she was seized with a fit of coughing, and threw up a considerable quantity of blood. She had made no bodily exertion to explain the occurrence, but thought she might have been hurried in her spirits, by the expectation that she was probably to be tapped on that day. She expressed the clearest conviction that she should not survive the attack.

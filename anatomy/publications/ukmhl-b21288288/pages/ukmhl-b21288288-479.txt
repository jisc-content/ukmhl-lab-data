BONES OF THE LIMB. 457 Case 118. Dislocated Ancle, ivith Fracture of the Fibula. Mrs. Mills, a robust heavy woman, aged fifty-two years, in descending some stairs, January 8, 1810, mistook two steps for one, when near the bottom, and fell down ; by which accident her right foot was dislocated outwards, and the fibula fractured,^ near the joint. She was immediately carried to bed, and was visited by her surgeon soon after- ward. The tumefaction was considerable, and the violence of the pain extreme. The parts were directed to be wrapped up in a fermenting poultice, to be changed three times a day. By the following morning the whole limb was considerably swelled and much discoloured, with the appearance of severe bruise. On various parts about tlie ancle and foot very extensive vesica^ tions had formed, the spaces beneath the cuticle being filled with a yellowish serum, and the num- ber of these vesications increased daily. On the fourth day, two of the largest vesicles contained five or six ounces of fluid each ; and, from the un- easiness these produced, they were opened, and the contents allowed to pass off. The parts were at first relieved, but the following afternoon was pass- ed in greater uneasiness, with heat, prickling, and shooting pains about the joint. The pulse was quiet; the skin, with very little thirst; the fer- menting poultices, therefore, were continued, MÂ«ith an occasional opiate at night, and other medicines, when necessary.

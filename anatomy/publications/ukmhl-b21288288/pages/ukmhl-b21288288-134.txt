ON THE AFFECTIONS 118 Examinatio7i. The contents of the head were examined, and found to be perfectly sound in every parti â€¢ The in- teguments were next dissected away from the spine, and the posterior part of each cervical vertebra removed with a saw, when a large quantity of ex- travasated blood was found in the cellular texture, between the bones and the theca vertebralis.: This extravasation was principally of fluid blood; some part, however, was coagulated, but as the affection had obviously extended itself further down, the spinous processes of the four superior dorsal vertebrae were successively separated by the saw, and dis- sected out, by which operation the whole extent of the mischief was brought into view. By the greater abundance and more perfectly fluid state of the eflused blood within the 2d, 3d, and dth vertebra of the neck, it appeared that the affection had commenced high up. Between the atlas and dentata the blood had made its way out between the bones backward, so that a small coa- gulum was brought into view in dissecting the mus- cles away from the external surface of these bones. It appears then, that the siidden jerk of the line backward, while the head and body were in rapid motion forward, produced a violent, though momen- tary cvirvature of the cervical vertebras j and the an- terior part of the bodies of the vertebrae being nearly in the centre of motion, explains why the vessels upon the posterior surface of the spinal marrow had suffered rupture.

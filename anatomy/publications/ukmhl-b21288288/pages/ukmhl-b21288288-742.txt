USE OP THE BOUGIE. Still the most appropriate means we know of, and indeed all that is adviseable to recommend, in the way of treatment, while the moderate degree of irrit- ability in the urethra admits of its being adopted as often as may be necessary. Sect. 3. Of the mrious Properties of 'various Bougies. With regard to the comparative merits of the different kinds of bougies, there have been various opinions. The common wax bougie is that which is in most general use, and for several reasc..s I think it deserves the preference it has obtained among practitioners. Some surgeons are in the ha- bit of using bougies formed of catgut, and in very contracted strictures that will not allow the smallest sized wax bougie to enter, the catgut bougie often proves useful, and may be tried with advantage. But it has been objected to the common bougie that it loses its proper consistence when allowed to remain in the urethra for any length of time, and this objection applies in a much greater degree to the bougie of catgut, which absorbs moisture ra- pidly, swelling, and untwisting its fibi'es to that de- gree as to occasion considerable irritation at the neck of the bladder, and giving great pain when it is withdrawn. #

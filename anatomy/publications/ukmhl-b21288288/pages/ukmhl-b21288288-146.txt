130 ON THE AFFECTIONS controul over the action of his limbs, that wishing to stop, he could not, but passed his own door, and endeavoured, with a view to save himself from falling, to lay hold of a post that was just beyond. By the time he had proceeded about a hundred yards further, he succeeded in checking himself; and as his family who had seen him, ran out to his assistance, he at length reached his house without falling, but almost breathless, and fatigued to a degree which he did not recover for several days. The frequent effect of those diseases that pro- duce effusion upon the brain, being that of impair- ing nervous sensation and power, it is not surpris- ing that a series of muscular actions, over which the will usually exerts an absolute command, should, under the influence of these affections, sometimes prove defective; the impressions derived from vo- lition being more or less confounded with those by which the involuntary actions are produced. Indeed, the singular circumstances of this case, bear a strong affinity to the phenomena of chorea, and are readily explicable upon the same principle. In the beginning of October 1814, he suffered another more severe attack than either of the for- mer. This reduced him to the most helpless state conceivable. Treatment was had recourse to with- out effect, and after languishing some time he died on the 12th day of the month. It was matter of extreme regret and disappoint- ment, that the friends could not by any means be prevailed upon to allow the examination of the body.

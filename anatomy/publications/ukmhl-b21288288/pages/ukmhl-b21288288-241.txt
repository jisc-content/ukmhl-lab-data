AFFECTIONS OF THE LUNGS. ^23 The pain and all his complaints were fixed in the right lobe of the lungs, and he could then, as at the fi^st instant after the accident, cover the exact spot with his hand. Spitting of blood continued to recur, at intervals, and the poor fellow was con- signed to certain death. This lasted from the 15tli of April, to the 12th of August following, when, after a copious spitting of blood, with a sudden fit of coughing, he threw up something with violence towards his teeth, against the roof of his mouth, mixed with blood. Perceiving it a hard substance, and ever havmg the nail in his mind, he spit into his hand, and found it to be the identical nail that had slipt down the trachea so long before. The head of the nail was rusty when thrown up.* April, 1815. Eleven or twelve years have elapsed since this event took place, and the man has en- joyed pretty good health; subject however to occasional cough, slight spitting of blood, and a painful sensation, precisely in the old spot. * The form of the nail is shewn in Plate 3, Fig. 3.

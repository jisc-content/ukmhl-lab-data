I have ventured to state my opinion, that the sternum is particularly subject to affections of this kind. That they do occur, the instances just no- ticed, sufficiently prove ; and that they occasion- ally connect themselves with abscess of the me- dulla of the bone, is fully established by an exten- sive series of preparations*. In one of these the patient died previous to the complete formation of abscess ; from the increased activity in the secret- ing arteries of the medulla, and the consequent ac- cumulation of soft contents, the two tables of the bone were separated to a considerable distance from each other, and on the external surface of the bone^ the tumor must, during life, have been evident on examination. In another specimen, the tables of the bone formed the parietes of a pretty large ab- scess of the medulla, which broke outwardly, al- though it was-originally produced by neighbouring scrofulous disease and suppuration in the lungs.

ON HJEMORRHOIDAL DISEASES. 309 State of the -veins, but although these swellings possessed all the common characters, they were by no means varicose veins. With a view to ascertain exactly the structure of these tumors, they were allowed to steep in alcohol for a month, by which means the contained blood was very firmly coagu- lated. A section was then made through the cen- tre of each, and the appearances were found to be very uniform and satisfactory. The tumor was certainly produced by blood, but it was neither a varicose vein, nor an effusion from a varicose vein. Had it been the former, the blood wathin the vein, or at least the cavity of such vein, smust have been visible; if the latter, the effusion would have been single and considerable. The haemor- rhage had clearly enough taken place from the ca- pillary vessels distributed in the cellular membrane, about the extremity of the rectum and external margin of the sphinctor. The blood had evidently been effused at different periods, forming to itself as many little cysts, in the surrounding cellular sub- stance. The very various tints in the colour of the coagula proved that some had been more re- cently deposited than others. In some instances, the same vessel had repeatedly given way, which was evinced by the section exposing several con- centric lamina, the external having the brightest and freshest colour, while those within were by gradations darker. The aggregate number of co- agula contained within one hasraorrhoidal tumor must have been considerable, for upon the surface of the section, which could only have exposed a X 3

He had been in the hospital about three months, when he died. Examination. On opening the body, the liver was found, in point of general texture, perfectly healthy. In the superior part, however, towards the convex surface of the right lobe was an abscess, large enough to contain twelve ounces of fluid. This had burst upwards, and, assisted by previously formed adhesions on both sides- the diaphragm, had opened a commu- nication with the bronchial ramifications. The cavity of the abscess contained a purulent matter, mixed with bilious fluid, in which were floating a considerable number of hydatids. Some of these were as small as peas, others large as hazel nuts. The gall bladder was extremely tense, and quite full of healthy bile, but unable to get rid of it, an hydatid of considerable size having made its way by the ductus hepaticus into the ductus communis, where it had so increased, as^ to completely block up the passage into the duo- denum. The intestinal canal was loaded with pale, stiff, clay-coloured, excrements.

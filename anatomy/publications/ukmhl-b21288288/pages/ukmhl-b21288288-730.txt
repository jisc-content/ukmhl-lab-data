188 MOST USUAL SEAT OF STRICTURE. pointed out that in the first of these two situations there is a provision for an occasional spasmodic ac- tion of the muscular fibres of the urethra, as a cir- cumstance essential to the complete effect of the most important function these parts have to per- form. This, therefore is found to be naturally the most contracted part of the urethra, and it is by far the most frequent seat of stricture. Next to the membranous part the bulb of the urethra is most subject to contraction, although the same thing occasionally takes place in the other parts between the bulb and the external orifice of the canal. Sect. 6. Of the Symptoms produced by Stricture. Stricture in the urethra is a disease which in its commencement is very rarely, if ever, observed. Its early progress is imperceptible, because it is not often productive of symptoms. It is natural to suppose that even in its beginning, as a stricture consists in a contraction of the canal, the diameter of the stream of urine must of necessity be les- sened; but the same circumstance, it is well known, may arise from such various and trivial causes, that this symptom when alone is scarcely ever attended to by the patient. The appearance of the stream of urine, may however have a more striking peculiarity, for in

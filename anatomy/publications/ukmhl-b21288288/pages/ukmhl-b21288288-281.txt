STOMACH AND INTESTINAL CANAL. ^63 s 4 The whole extent of this part of the canal was almost completely changed by ulceration, which had taken place universally, in lai-ge irregular patches. The period at which this change oc- curred, must have been remote, for the ulcerated parts of the surface were completely covered by cicatrices, which were of a finer, and smoother texture, than the surrounding natural structure. The above appearances, to a certain degree, ex- plain the symptoms which attended in the latter part of this poor man's life. It is not the least curious circumstance, that for the last six weeks, his appetite and digestion should have been remarkably vigorous, and that his bowels, regulated by opium, were kept in excellent order. He generally had from three to five copious and healthy-looking stools in the course of the day. The uncommon strength of his digestive powers led me more than once to hope he would recover, not then aware of the diseased state of the great intestines, in which, by the extensive change of surface, the important function of absorption from that part of the bowels was totally destroyed. From reference to the date of the early symptoms, it appeared that, for the last five months of his life, he must have been supported by the absorp- tion from the stomach and small intestines only. It had often been observed as singular, that not only the lightest preparation of bark, but even the mildest kind of food, if opium was omitted, always produced an immediate attack of diarrhaea. This circumstance, however, was very readily explained,

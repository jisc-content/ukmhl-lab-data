2 STRUCTURE, &C. OF THE KIDNEY. fitting them for the performance of their office in secretion. They form small masses of vessels, easily seen by the microscope, when injected; and these vessels seen in some points of view appear to take a serpentine course, in others they have the appear- ance of radii, and in others again they are convoluted upon themselves. But the nature of that power by which a parti- cular set of capillary arteries are rendered capable of selecting and combining certain elementary prin- ciples, derived from the general mass of circulating blood, so as to produce a new compound or secre- tion, which cannot in any case be detected in the blood itself, is one of those points in physiology, in which we are still obliged to confess our want of information. The art of injection, however, has proved beyond a doubt, that the minute arterial extremities have an established communication with two distinct sets of vessels ; one of these being the extreme branches of the renal veins, the other the tubuli uriniferi, or proper excretory ducts of the gland. Air, water, and urine tinged with ink, may be readily driven round from the renal artery into the excretory ducts, as well as into the veins of the kidney, and even wax has occasionally been made to pass in both these directions.* * Boerhaave.

OM DISLOCATION" 464 tirely incapable of action, as in complete dislo- cation. From the extent of relaxation that I have some- times observed in the ligaments of the large joints, there seems to be ground for believing that com^ plete as well as incomplete luxation may in some cases occur at the shoulder without laceration of the capsule, particularly as there is demonstra- tive evidence of its occasionally taking place in the hip-joint. Having premised these general observations, 1 shall now proceed to relate a case of partial dislo- cation of the shoulder, which was capable of being reduced. I shall next describe the state of parts that may result, where this kind of luxation proves incapable of reduction j and in doing this an op- portunity will be afforded for explaining the first step of a most interesting and curious process of nature, which like many others that are occasion- ably set up in the animal economy, leads the mind on involuntarily to the contemplation of that Su- preme Intelligence by whom alone, a fabric exhibit- ing such endless proofs of contrivance and resource within itself, could have been originally designed. The more perfect result of the same process will be subsequently pointed out, as demonstrated upon a preparation where a complete dislocation of the shoulder had taken place, and had remained unre- duced ; to be followed by some concluding parallel remarks upon dislocation at the hip-joint.

164- ENLARGEMENT OF LYMPHATIC GLANDS, &C. where the rapid increase of his complaints required, that at all risks he should use mercury, which was consequently ordered for him. The venereal com- plaints continued for some time to increase, and for these he used (with few intermissions) the mer- curial frictions every night till the middle of Octo- ber. By this means his system was kept in a state of moderate excitement for the above period, and his venereal symptoms removed. The sweUing upon the neck previous to his com- mencing the above course had been very consider- able, so that his neck appeared twice as large as natu- ral, bis head was inclined to the opposite side, and in damp or bad weather the quantity of the tumor in- creased to that degree as to produce much inconveni- ence both in swallowing, and breathing. The feel of this swelling was that of a congeries of soft, but very large pulpy tumors, so closely compacted together, as to form one general mass ; occupying the space in which the string of lymphatic glands are usually situated in the neck. The necessity for mercury was bowever so clear, that however unfit the state of his constitution might be, there was no time to hesitate as to the adoption of the treatment; and it is worth ob- serving that the result of the experiment was de- cidedly happier than could have been expected. Through the whole period of the exhibition of mercury, I watched this tumor in the neck with attention, but it remained altogether stationary, neither becoming at any time painful, nor gaining or losing any thing of its previous magnitude.

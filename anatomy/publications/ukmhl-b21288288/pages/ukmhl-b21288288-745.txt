'MODE OF APPLYING THE BOUGIE. -^^o until the point stops at the contracted part. A mo- derate degree of pressure is then to be made against the stricture, and continued for a short time, but should the instrument not be enabled to pass, it must be withdrawn, and one of a size smaller sub- stituted. By this means it will be ascertained what particular sized bougie is best adapted to the de- gree and tone of the contraction. The bougie de- termined upon should be so large as to pass the stricture with a moderate degree of pressure; the period for which it is allowed to remain must be regulated very much by the feelings of the pa- tient, and the same rule must also direct from time to time an occasional increase in the size of the in- strument. In the use of the bougie however, it has been al- ready shewn, that the least deviation between the line of pressure, and that of the natural course of the canal at the part where the point of the instru- ment may happen to be, is sure to do harm, as it in- variably tends to lay the foundation for the pro- duction of a false passage ; and the particular in- stance adduced*, where this consequence took place is sufficiently striking to prove that no per- son is equal to the task of introducing a bougie upon himself without the risk of getting into this di- lemma, which, independent of all other inconve- * See Page 157.

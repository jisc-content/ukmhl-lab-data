AFFECTIONS OF THE HEART. 191 to and fro between the ventricle and auricle, there being no longer any power to ensure its expulsion into the arteries. The primary cause of the disease appears to have been the slight degree of inflammation which had existed on the external surface of the heart, ter- minating as it did, almost before effusion could be said to have taken place. But why the disposition to a wrong action should have subsequently set- tled upon this particular valve, is not so easily determined. It was a chronic affection j appa- rently a mediate impulse, between secretion, and growth, which had been given in the first instance, by the inflammation of the pericardium having terminated, perhaps, rather abruptly, in adhesion.*= I have only dissected three instances of original mal-formation of the heart. In these the pecuHar * Plate 3. Fig. 2. Exhibits the appearance of the diseased valve, represented of its natural size. a a.

The parts where the disease had extended itself from the margin of the valve along the chordae tendineae^ some of which are seen more or less thickened, and others converted into a florid fungous matter.

370 ON LUMBAR ABSCESS. hip, was situated in a middle line between the great trochanter and the sacrum. The integu- ^ ments were gangrenous to some distance round, and were separated from the parts beneath. A probe was passed through an opening in the fascia near the bottom of the sacro-lumbal muscle, and cutting freely upon the probe, the knife struck against a carious bone, which proved to be the back of the sacrum. It was very extensively ca- rious, and in several parts entirely destroyed. By the margin of this carious portion of bone to- wards the right side, the finger readily passed round to its concave anterior surface completely separated from the diseased and thickened perios- teum, which was as a thick integument spread loosely over it. The whole of the concave surface of the sacrum was in a carious state. The original seat of the abscess appeared to have been the concave part of the sacrum, be- tween the bone and the periosteum, from which situation the matter had passed round the bone, insinuating itself between the interstices of the muscles upon the lower part of the loins, so as at length to reach the surface. This was the most probable progress of the case ; but in prosecuting the dissection, to ascertain whether the bones of the spine were sound, the right psoas muscle was laid open, and a quantity of bright-yellow purulent fluid, mingled with shreds of curdly matter, poured out. This pus was without the least unpleasant smell, whereas the matter found in the other cavi- vities of the disease, and which resembled what

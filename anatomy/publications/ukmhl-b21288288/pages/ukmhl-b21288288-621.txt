SYMPTOMS OF STONE. 79 vitality is possessed by both, if we make some allow- ance for its being destitute in the one instance of the appendages it possesses in the other, of blood vessels, nerves, &c.; and consequently, such expe- riments as tend to illustrate the effect of chemical agencies upon the fibrin of the blood out of the body, will also tend to explain the principle of action of the same substances, as they operate upon the mus- cular fibre of the constitution. Now it has been clearly demonstrated by experi- ment, that all the acids, but especially those derived from the mineral kingdom, have the power of pro- moting and confirming the coagulation and contrac- tion of the fibrin of the blood, while the alkalies on the contrary, tend to weaken or prevent the act of coagulation; indeed, in their concentrated state they are capable of dissolving the fibrin, subsequent to its having assumed the solid form; and the power which pure or caustic alkali exerts, when applied to the living body, producing a rapid decomposition by disturbing the arrangement of its elements, affords a strong proof that all living matter is,liable to be affected even to disorganization by the influence of the more powerful of the chemical affinities. Upon these grounds it appears to me, that not- withstanding much of the good resulting from the exhibition of alkalies in the irritation of stone may depend on their checking the excessive separation of uric acid by the kidneys, they principally operate

EXTERNAL TO THE BRAIN. 3i to believe that the original afFection was the means of exciting a copious secretion of ossific matter, forming a more dense and compact texture than is naturaf to these parts ; a change which generally results from healthy ossific inflammation. The absorption or removal of bone, under what- ever circumstances it takes place, is a very curious process. It is one of those operations that always merits our attention, and oftentimes displays the amazing fertility of resource which the powers of the animal machine are capable of displaying. In many cases the absorption of bone takes place under circumstances which in themselves afford an ample illustration of the successive steps or grada- tions of the process ; sometimes, however, it is otherwise. Where the pericranium, of an adult, for example, has suffered injury from external violence, and a formation of matter has been the consequence, the necessarily impaired state of the circulation through the bone, at once explains the reason why the medullary secretions in its minute structure, andprobably the affinities of its elementary principles also, suffer change, inducing absorption more or less extensive of the substance of the bone. But where an injury has been received upon the head of an infant, and is followed by the absorption of a pretty extensive portion of the cranium, without any intervening inflammation, or the least tendency to suppuration, there is sufficient evidence that the formation of pus is by no means essential to this

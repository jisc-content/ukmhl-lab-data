25 RENAL HJ3M0RRHAGE. connected with the irritable state of the soft parts, produce abrasion of surface, or ulceration, extend- ing itself so as to include the coats of some of the small arteries, and in either of these modes it may excite haemorrhage. When these accidents occur, the blood passing down by the ureter either forms a coagulum in the bladder, giving a peculiar colour to the urine, or it may principally be evacuated in a fluid state by the urethra with the urine, in which case it subse- quently deposits a coagulum at the bottom of the vessel. The treatment of this kind of haemorrhage will generally be of little importance. Where it ap- pears that exercise or exertion has produced it, rest and quietness will frequently prove to be all that is necessary for its removal. Where, however, the quantity of blood lost is cansiderable, and more especially when the haemorrhage is disposed to con- tinue, it may become an object of importance to determine on some means for preventing its further progress. Bleeding, either general or local, is rarely ad- viseable, for it most frequently happens, that the constitution has been already sufficiently reduced by the irritation of the preceding stages of the dis- ease. Among the medicines most appropriate for the cure of these complaints, some of the acids, the vegetable balsams, and the more powerful sedatives may be enumerated.

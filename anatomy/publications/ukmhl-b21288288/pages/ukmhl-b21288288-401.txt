( 581 ) CHAP. VIII. ON HIP DISEASE. The affections of the hip joint are among the most tedious of all the diseases that fall v/ithin the province of surgery. Many weeks, or even months, will sometimes intervene between the application of the cause, and the subsequent production of pain or inconvenience to the patient j and even when symptoms do arise, they frequently creep forward in so insidious a manner as to deceive the patient into a false security, till the most favourable moment for averting ill consequences has past by, and is not to be recalled. The parts about the hip are unfortunately si- tuated for recovering from the effects of accidental violence. They may be regarded as placed, to a certain degree, in the centre of motion between the body and limbs; and when either the bones or the soft parts covering them have been accidentally injured, a natural aversion to submit to the adop- tion of painful and tedious measures for security, where there is no apparent external mischief to require them, prevent the majority of patients from attending to themselves, while such attention might really serve them. They are induced to wait the issue of the first abscess, or the first inflammation.

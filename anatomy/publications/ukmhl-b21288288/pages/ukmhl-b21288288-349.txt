329 OF THE TESTICLE. : the wound, the edges of which, by degrees, assumed a callous, unhealthy aspect. There was also an in- durated feel perceived about the parts, directly be- low the seat of the fungous tubercle. The disease had not, however, yet become painful, nor did it seem to be particularly sensible; but it continued to increase so fast, that in the course of a fortnight it had attained the size of a walnut. From this time the characters of the tumor un- derwent a slow change, by which, from being a mere indurated tubercle, it gradually took on all the peculiarities of the original disease. It was proposed to try as an application to the parts, a concentrated solution of the lunar caustic, with a view to reduce the volume of the fungus, or at least to prevent its increase. Cloths, wetted with the solution, were laid over the whole surface of the tumor, but it had no effect. The haemorrhages now came on exactly as be- fore, and thev soon became formidable. On October 20, Mr. Heaviside, and Sir W. BHz- ard, urged by the entreaty of the patient, as well as by the evidently alarming tendency of the disease, performed a second operation, by which the whole of the diseased parts were to appearance again com- pletely extirpated. In separating the basis of the disease from its attachments, it became necessary to dissect it off from the side of the corpus spon- giosum urethrae. Considerable inflammation and tumor followed, . the suppuration proving infinitely greater than after the first operation. This may be partly explained

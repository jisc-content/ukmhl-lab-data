AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. 4.63 auction. - Where however, the patient is not only very muscular, but also very fat, these become the most embarrassing cases in surgery. The great thickness of the mass of soft parts renders the exact state of the parts very obscure. Even in thin sub- jects, the depression beneath the acromion scapulae cannot always be either distinctly perceived by the eye, nor decidedly ascertained by the finger, but the head of tl^e bone may be more or less clearly felt to project in the direction of the luxation ; but occasionally, in very muscular subjects, nothing at all can be satisfactorily made out by examining the joint, except that its power of motion is lost. The head of the bone cannot be ascertained, either for- ward, backward, or downwards. When things are in this state, X have in various instances seen very persevering and well managed attempts at re- duction fail. The great strength of the surround- ing muscles, together with the additional power they exert in consequence of the irritation which they must feel in common with the strained capsule of the joint render it in some few cases absolutely impossible to succeed particularly when several days have been lost previous to reduction being attempted. Where a partial dislocation has remained unre- duced, the fine smooth cartilaginous surfaces of the joint being no longer opposed to each other, the muscles no longer possess their former power in producing with facility the motions of the joint; and the limb consequently remains nearly or en-

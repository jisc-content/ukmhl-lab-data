This immense tumor, at first, looked not much unlike the bag of a large aneurism, but its feel was much more like a thin cyst, full of fluid.

The cartilaginous parts of the ribs being next di- vided, the sternum was carefully raised, and it then appeared that a very extensive disease had formed in the cavity of the chest. The heart was sound, but had been pressed so completely out of its natural situation, that it was with some difficulty found.

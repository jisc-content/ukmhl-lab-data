EXTERNAL TO THE BRAIN. W When he was old enough to be sent to service, he earned his bread as a gardener, which business he continued to follow without having experienced a day's sickness, or confinement from work, for the space of fifty years and upwards. In eating, he was constantly in the habit of thrusting in his food with his fingers, by the left side of the mouth, where several of the teeth were deficient.* * Plate 1. Fig. 2. Represents the appearance of the an- chylosis of the maxillary bones, on a reduced scale. a. The angle of the lower jaw, from which the exfoliated scale of bone was thrown off during childhood. The part is seen still impressed with the puckered appear- ance of a cicatrix, confirming the accuracy of the early ' part of the history of the case. The corresponding part of the opposite side of the jaw exhibits a similar character. b. The anchylosed condyle of the jaw, round which the faintly depressed line marks the precise point of union. The striking features of the preparation are extremely singular. The articulating surface of the opposite con- dyle had lost its natural figure, but was not anchylosed. c. The last molar tooth, the fangs of which, as well as those of the tooth next to it, had by time and disuse be- come consolidated, forming an ossific tumor, larger than the crown of the tooth. The same change, in a greater or less degree, had also taken place in most of the other teeth. d. A process of bone projecting backward from the inside of the chin. e. Part of the temporal bone. y. The OS malae. g g. Exhibit a curious effect of the gentle but frequently repeated pressure, incident to the constant habit of pushing in the food at one part of the mouth. It had produced an extensive absorption of the maxillary bones, above and below.

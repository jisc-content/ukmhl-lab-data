Sb2 ON HiEMORRHOlDAL DISEASES. 6. The ligature should be sufficiently strong to admit of its being drawn tight as possible ; for if the degree of constriction falls short of this, the tumor will be only partially destroyed, the circu- lation still subsisting in the remaining portion. In one instance, however, where, in a lady, i had ^ tied three haemorrhoidal tumors, one of them, on the third day, appeared to be red and plump, as if the blood was circulating through itj and when touched in the lightest manner, the patient was perfectly sensible of it. 1 could not help feeling some uneasiness, under the impression that the con- striction would prove inadequate. Fortunately it gave way just afterwards, mortified, and the liga- ture came away with it on the seventh day, which is however rather later than usual. A strong circumstance in favor of the ligature, I consider to be the following. By the ligature a certain degree of inflammation is sure to take place, with considerable tumefaction about the parts, and consequent effusion of lymph into the sur- rounding cellular texture. The tumors mortify, and the inflammation and swelling subside, but a permanent consolidation of structure is the result. The effused lymph is only, partially re-absorbed, and the parts in which the disease naturally forms itself^ are thus rendered less liable to give way, than they were originally. Where, on the contrary, the knife has been em- ployed, scarcely any inflammation follows. The disturbance to the parts by excision, is compar- atively trifling, and the haemorrhage being always

DISTENSION OF THE KIDNEY, &C. 13 long continuance of obstruction in any part of the urinary passages, the flow of urine being inter- rupted, the cavities of the kidney become loaded with the fluid, which accumulates as it is secreted. By this means a degree of pressure is established, which as it increases, induces by degrees a total re- solution of the whole of the natural structure of the gland, which is ultimately found converted into an assemblage of large and small cysts, or thin membranous capsules. The kidney is also now and then subjected to a disease, that I believe commences in the cellular texture, immediately behind the membrane lining the cavities of the gland. Serous fluid is deposited at certain points, and as this fluid accumulates, the pressure from within operates by condensing the cellular structure, so as to form cysts which become detached from the surrounding parts, and subse- quent to this period, they sometimes by continuing to grow larger, excite a partial absorption of the mucous membrane lining the cavities of the kidney, and upon this principle hydatids of various dimen- sions have in certain cases made their escape into the ureter, and have been voided with the urine from the bladder. The consequences that arise from over distension of the cavities of the kidney when accumulation of urine takes place, will be again adverted to in the consideration of the treatment of these complaints j

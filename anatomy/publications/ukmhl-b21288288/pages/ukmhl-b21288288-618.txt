76 DISAPPEARANCE OF THE The remedies thus proposed have been all of an alkaline nature, and have all had an alkaline matter for their base, and it is most true that by the exhibi- tion of this class of medicines, the symptoms arising from stone in the bladder are very generally allevi- ated, and not unfrequently removed; and they may often be given to such an extent that the urine be- comes very manifestly alkaline, and is capable of exerting a solvent power upon these concretions. But on the other hand, it rarely happens that their administration can be continued to this extent, for any considerable length of time, from the disturb- ance they produce in the state of the digestive or- gans, and sometimes also in the urinary passages. Considered therefore as solvents, the alkalies are now but rarely used, and they are employed merely to alleviate symptoms or to prevent the increase of the concretion, purposes to which they are supposed to be principally adapted by preventing the gener- ation of uric acid, or at least the separation of it by the kidneys, in consequence of which the urine is rendered less irritating. But the influence these remedies are capable of exerting in relieving the symptoms of stone in the bladder extends, I believe, far beyond the mere pre- vention of the,evolution of uric acid in the kidneys. There is sufficient evidence that they possess a very remarkable power in diminishing irritability of the bladder, and allaying excitement of that viscus, even

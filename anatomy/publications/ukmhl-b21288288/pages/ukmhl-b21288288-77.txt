AND ITS MEMBRANES. 61 teries in the cortical substance of the brain, it was concluded, that it most probably had arisen from some alteration in the structure, or action of the capillary vessels, by which a portion of the colour- ing matter of the blood, just sufficient to leave a stain round the circumference of the vessel, had been allowed to escape, without proceeding to any more obvious degree of extravasation. The lateral ventricle on the right side was in its natural state, and contained only the usual quantity of fluid. On the left, however, the appearance was widely different; the quantity of lymph de- posited in this ventricle was equal to an ounce and an half, or two ounces. The cornua of the ventricle had suffered con- siderable distension from the accumulation of fluid, the discharge of which was not, as on the other side, followed by a collapsed state of the ventricle. The appearance, after the fluid had run off, was that of a large vaulted passage, or tube, which to the eye gave a bold and remarkable impression. The whole space retained the exact form into which the uniform pressure of the contained fluid had moulded it. In the ventricle, on each side, the plexus cho- roides was pale, and contained several small soft tumors, that were extremely vascular. Upon examining various sections of the cerebel- lum, its structure was in every respect perfectly natural, so that whatever might be the nature of the peculiar appearance in the cortical substance

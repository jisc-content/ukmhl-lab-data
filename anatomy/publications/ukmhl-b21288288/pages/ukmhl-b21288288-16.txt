AFFECTIONS OF I'ARTS past he had been totally unable to read the largest and clearest print. j On examination, or pressure, no pain, or evm sense of feeling was excited in the tumor upon tie scalp. Having very frequently seen and remo\ed such tumors, wjthout their being productive of sny particular symptom, I merely advised its being dis- sected off, alleging that it would continue to grow larger, however slowly, and would consequently more readily admit of removal at the present, than at any future period. The part was removed by carrying two elHptical incisions through the legu- ments beyond the basis of the tumor, the portion of included scalp, with the tumor itself, being sub- sequently dissected away from the pericrafiium, with which it was in contact. I think this mode preferable to the dissecthg off the whole of the integuments from the cyst. It is quite unnecessary to save so much skin, unkss the space covered by the base of the tumor is large; and by removing the whole, where it can le done with propriety, the object of the operation is more neatly, and more quickly accorapHshed. Performed in this way, there is also a greiter cer- tainty of removing the cyst entire, than ]vhen the integuments have to be separated all rouid, parti- cularly where the coats of the cyst are thin, and yielding. j The tumor removed, two very small \essels were tied, and the integuments brought near^ together, with adhesive plaster. In three weej^ the liga- tures were off, and the wound perfectly healed.

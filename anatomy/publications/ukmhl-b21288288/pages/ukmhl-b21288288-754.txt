212 MODES OF REMOVING and with extreme distress to the patient, in either case obliging him to drag on an irksome exist- ence, loathsome to himself, and offensive to others. To relieve him from the miserable prospect which this state affords for the rest of his life, is the proper object of surgery, and there are various modes of attempting the accompUshment of it; but they are all painful, and all more or less uncertain as to their eventual success. Upon these grounds then, it becomes right to explain to the patient beforehand the comparative merits of each method of treatment, that he may, if he chooses, determine for himself. It appears to me that the lunar caustic is in such cases deserving of the preference. It is true the stricture may in most instances be cut down upon by an operation, and may in this way be either laid open, or entirely dissected out, allowing the parts to heal over an elastic gum catheter, in which case the patient may do well, and even perfectly recover ; but this is a very severe operation, and attended with con- siderable haemorrhage. Or by passing a silver canula down to the stricture, a fine spear pointed instrument may be conducted to the part, and may be thrust through the stricture so as to divide it, and perhaps in this way a passage may be restored to the sound part of the urethra beyond, the divided part being subsequently made to heal over a bougie or catheter.

BONES OF THE LIMB. F F 3 457 had fallen to 90, and was becoming full again, though soft. The purulent discharge from the ul- cers was very abundant, particularly round the margin of the exfoliating piece of bone. The pain in the leg continued to decrease, and the general health continued to improve till Novem- ber 24, when he took a violent cold, and com- plained of severe pains in his limbs. This attack fortunately, was not the means of increasing, in the least degree, his local uneasiness. He was directed to take the compound powder of ipecacuanha every evening, and this presently removed his cold. A few days after this he observed that the pains in his leg had much increased since he had left oft'tak- ing the bark, upon which account, his cold being removed, the cinchona was again ordered, and his Hmb, in a day or two, became easy again. The exfoliation was observed to be gradually rising, and at the upper end was advancing with the quickest pace; the granulations that had previ- ously covered that part of the bone were progres- sively removed by absorption, and the extremity of the exfoliating piece was raised to a level with the external surface of the leg. The appearance of the absorption of the granu- lations was as if the mass became every day nar- rower than the day before, by which the margin next the centre of the exfoliation was as it were drawn insensibly back towards the external circum- ference of the ulcer. This process was completed on November 30, on which day the edge of the separated piece of bone was completely exposed.

^4 AFFECTIONS OF PARTS and extending to all the bones attached to the upper jaw, in which the superior maxillary bone, the OS mals, os nasi, and boney palate, were all involved. This appeared more fully upon a sub- sequent and more careful dissection of the disease. All these bones had from pressure suflfered a separation at their respective points of union, with such a degree of extension and attenuation of their- natural substance, that even the strongest parts of the bones were in many places reduced to the thickness of wafer paper. The OS mal^ was detached from the rest of the bones, and lay in that part of the tumor where a fluid bloody serum was lodged, exhibiting a very curious and elegant cribriform appearance, though in its natural state a very solid bone. The other bones were rendered equally thin, and were spread out like malleable gold.* A single instance of a disease similar to the above in its progress and termination, has been described by Sandifort.f In the one case the first appearance of the tumor was upon the palate, in the other within the cavity of the nose. In the one, the disease ran its fatal course in six years, in the other the patient lived under it for thirteen years. In both instances a strong disposition to haemorrhage was the prevailing character; in both • the patients were females; cmd in both the disease * Plate 1. Fig. 3.

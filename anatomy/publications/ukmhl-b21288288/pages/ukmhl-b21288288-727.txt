CAUSES OF STRICTURE. J-O^ of the contraction will be dependant on the cir- cumstances under which the irritation has been appHed. Where the stricture has been brought on by sympathy with some of the surrounding parts, as in disease of the rectum, bladder, or prostate gland, the affection will be at first purely spasmodic, and will be very likely to remain so ; but where, on the other hand, an irritating cause of considerable power has been at once brought into immediate con- tact with the inner membrane of the urethra, as is the case where astringent injections are used in go- norrhoea, or when a calculus is arrested in its passage through the urethra exciting extreme pain and violent inflammation, it generally happens that an effusion of coagulable lymph takes place into the surrounding cellular texture, thus laying the foundation for the most obstinate, and extensive, kind of stricture. The irritation of stone in the bladder generally operates in the course of time as an exciting cause of stricture in the urethra; and where the con- traction is obviously of a spasmodic nature, and is readily overcome, so as to admit of the calculus being distinctly felt in the bladder, the affection in the urethra may very safely be considered as the accidental consequence of the irritable state of the parts. It has long been a contested point in surgery, whether injections thrown into the urethra, have

In the majority of cases, it is certainly not possible to prove that they have done so, but in several very strongly marked instances I have known them, through the medium of inflammation, not only leave stricture, but stricture of the worst and most obstinate kind that could possibly be, which never afterwards was removed, and scarcely admitted of any material relief. In these instances however, the seat of the affection having been the anterior or external part of the canal, and this not being the most usual situation of stricture originating in spasm, it might still admit of a doubt whether the irritation from an injection applied to the one extremity of the urethra, is capable of producing a spasmodic stricture at the other. As far as my experience has enabled me to judge, I am clearly of opinion that it does happen, and that stricture is in many instances derived from this cause alone.

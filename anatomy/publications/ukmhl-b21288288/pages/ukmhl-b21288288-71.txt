AND ITS MEMBRANES. 55 the left hemisphere of the brain and pia mater was iliscovered bathed in blood, partly fluid, and partly grumous. The hemisphere on the opposite side was entirely free from this appearance. On the surface of the right hemisphere, the pia mater was in many places separated from the arachnoid mem- brane by the interposition of a serous fluid, not in any considerable quantity, but sufficient to shew the tendency to lymphatic effiasion. The extravasation of blood was, on further ex- amination, found to have universally diffiised it- self over every part of the cerebellum, as well as cerebrum, upon the left side. Perhaps the quantity of blood thrown out by the more recent effusion, might have been in the whole equal to three or four ounces. On opening the lateral ventricles, the plexus choroides bore some traces of disease. Several little tumors, resembling small hydatids, were found in each plexus, towards that portion situated within the descending horn of the ventricle. The left side of the basis of the cranium could scarcely be seen, from the quantity of effused blood that remained after the lobes of the brain were removed. The branches of the internal carotid arteries were in several places considerably ossified. The medulla oblongata and medulla spinalis were taken out, and the only remarkable appearance found in this part, related to the left vertebral artery. This vessel, at the point where it emerges from its canal in the occi- pital bone, had become so enlarged as to be almost E 4

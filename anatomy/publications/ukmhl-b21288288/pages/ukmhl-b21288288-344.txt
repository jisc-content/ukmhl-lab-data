824 FUNGUS HiEMATODES the scrotum and groin on the affected side feeling of course perfectly empty. Sect. 2. ON FUNGUS H^MATODES OF THE TESTICLE. The fungus hasmatodes, or soft cancer, occa- sionally affects the testicle. The only case I have seen of this disease, was as distressing in its pro- gress, as it was unhappy in its event, notwithstand- ing every thing was done, which the best opinions were able to suggest on the behalf of the patient. Case 94. Fungus Hasmatodes of the Testicle. Mr. K., a middle aged gentleman, of weak and irritable habit, perceived an enlargement taking place in his right testicle, about the beginning of May, 1803. This he attributed to a supposed strain received the preceding March in lifting a heavy weight. On the 11th of May, after much fatigue in walking, it gave him considerable pain, and he applied to his apothecary. On examination the testicle was found to be enlarged to double its natural size. He was, therefore, directed to suspend it, and was ordered an aperient mixture. ' Notwithstanding these precautions, the swelling continued to increase, and the apothecary in at- tendance, judging from the soft yielding feel of . the tumor, could not persuade himself the case was any thing more than a common hydrocele.

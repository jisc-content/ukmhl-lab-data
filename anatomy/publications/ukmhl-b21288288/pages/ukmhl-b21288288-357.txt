An opening was therefore made at the lower part of the tumor, and several ounces of most offen- sive, purulent matter escaped. A probe was then introduced, and the incision extended upward through the scrotum, making a pretty free divi- sion of the parietes. As the incision was extended, the thickness of the divided mass was observed to increase, and at the termination of the line, the peculiar feel of the parts suggested the idea - of the testicle being very near; especially as the extending the incision had been more painful than the first opening. By introducing the finger, the cavity was now carefully examined, but the testicle could not any where be found on the posterior part of the cavity, nor in tiie cavity at all.

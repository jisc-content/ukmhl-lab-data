ON LUMBAR ABSCESS. 365 by a prompt attention to the means necessary for lowering the force of arterial action in the system, aided by the strict observance of abstinence and rest, for a certain time. There is perhaps no set of muscles in the body, so exposed to occasional disadvantageous action, in a mechanical point of view, as are the muscles supporting the loins, and upon this account they are in fact more subject to the various consequences of strain, than most other muscular parts of the body. But in this case as in most others, the pre- vailing state of the constitution very much regu- lates the effect produced. We often see those who are totally careless and negligent, expose them- selves to the most dangerous accidents, then ne- glect every precaution, an^ still avoid any ill conse- quence ; while others labour under a long and wearisome course of ill health arising spontane- ously as to any external agency, and consequently attributable to constitution alone.

He had in walking slipped down and struck his short ribs on the left side with great violence against the edge of the pavement. This accident happened in Octo- ber 1811, and he had ever since that time been subject to pain, and sometimes very pungent and severe stitches in and about that side, which he ne- glected till June 1812, when he procured assistance.

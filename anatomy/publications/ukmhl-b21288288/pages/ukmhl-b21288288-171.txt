OP THE LARYNX. 155 Whenever the complaint reaches this point, the operation of bronchotomy should be immediately performed; otherwise the extreme labour of res- piration, and the imperfect manner in which this function is carried on, will quickly destroy the powers of the constitution, and the patient will die exhausted, notwithstanding that relief which the late performance of the operation may be capa- ble of affording. As to tlie precise mode of performing the ope- ration, I beheve it is not material. After dividing the integuments longitudinally, either a transverse opening may be made between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, or a narrow longitudinal por- tion, including several of the rings of the trachea, may be removed with a pair of scissors; the latter of these two modes I think the best, as it affords the most adequate passage for the transmission of the air, while the situation of the opening'is more out of the way of the inferior thyroid artery, than a puncture would be, if made more imme- diately below the thyroid cartilage. The subsequent introduction of tubes of various kinds, has been recommended by some writers, but as they generally produce irritation, sometimes to the most extreme and distressing extent, and are very rarely indeed necessary, it should always be previously ascertained that the patient is unable to respire freely without such assistance. From observation, I should say that, in all pro- bability, spasm of the muscles of the glottis, is much less frequently concerned in the fatal events

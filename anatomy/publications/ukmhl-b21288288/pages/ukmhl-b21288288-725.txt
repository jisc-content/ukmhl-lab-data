NATURE OF SPASMODIC STRICTURE. 183 N of contraction in any particular part, is only a quality which it possesses in common with all other muscular structures placed in similar circumstances. Where, from any cause, the contraction of the muscular fibres of the urethra is partial, and to a certain extent permanent, it produces a hindrance to the free stream of urine, excites attention, and in this state is termed a spasmodic stricture. The affection, in this stage of its progress, is very properly considered to be of a spasmodic nature, as the term refers merely to an excessive action of muscular fibres, and not to any change in the organization of the parts. There are also many proofs- that this opinion of stricture is well founded. In the first place, the causes by which the contraction in the urethra may be brought on, are those that are known to be capable of producing irritation in any other muscular parts ; secondly, the sudden manner in which, in certain cases, the effect follows the cause, affords a strong argument that the stricture must be pure spasm ; and lastly it is proved by the immediate relief afforded by certain medicines, which it is well known can operate only by alleviating spasmodic action. This species of contraction has been * described ' as generally affecting only a very small extent of * By Mr. Hunter.

407 OF THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. D D 4 mained, and the smaller part, which was separated, was a bed of soft granulations; for although it was not very easily detached, it was supported only by an elastic yielding structure bearing it up, and admitting of some degree of lateral motion. Con- siderable bleeding followed the extraction of the separated piece. From this time the arm improved, and in three months more all the wounds were perfectly healed; but there was still a degree of tumefaction upon several parts of the surface of the ulna; and the deep depression where the separated piece of bone had been thrown off, was very perceptible. The integuments about the cicatrices were very thin, and closely adherent to the bone, which was firm and healthy, and no longer gave uneasiness on examination, or pressure. This tumid state of the ulna I examined two years subsequent to the healing of the last opening; but so slow.are most of the operations of life, when connected with bone, that at this distant period, although sensibly decHning, it was far from being restored to its natural smooth- ness of surface. * From the progress and appearances observed in the following case, I am led to believe the affec- tion commenced within the medullary cavity of the bone. * Plate 5.

The gorget is, on some accounts, a convenient in- strument, but many surgeons are of opinion, that from its having been repeatedly found, even in the most expert hand, liable to slip from the staff, or without this accident subject to inflict a second wound through the bladder, it should be alto- gether laid aside; particularly as the operation may be just as well performed by the knife alone. An ingenious mode of operating with the knife has been described*, in which the operation com- menced as for the gorget, is finished by means of a second staff introduced through the wound in the membranous part of the urethra, the knife * By Mr. Allan Burns.

OP THE LARYNX. 1^3 on the rima glottidis, and a sloughy-looking spot on the side of the glottis. The trachea imme- diately below the larynx was very slightly inflamed. But the inflammation was greater towards the lower part, and was much more intense in the bifurcation of the trachea, the ramifications from which leading to the bronchise, were choaked up with a puriform and mucous secretion. The lungs were much loaded with blood, and there was effusion of a purulent nature into the cellular mem- brane between the trachea and oesophagus. The dissection of those who die from inflam- mation of the mucous membrane within the la- rynx, occasionally demonstrates that it is by no means necessary that ulceration take place, or that a secretion of purulent or coagulable matter be throvvn out into the cavity of the larynx, in order to suffocation being induced; as this event has taken place, when, on examination after death, the affection has proved to be merely a tumid state of these parts, from oedema produced by an effusion of serous fluid into the cellular texture. The varieties of inflammatory affection to which the cavity of the larynx is subject, have not in general been observed with sufficient attention ; of late, however, the contributions of some eminent practitioners have brought to light some few liighly interesting facts, with regard to these most serious complaints. The rapidity with which they run their course.

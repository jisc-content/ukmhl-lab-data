They generally do well; for at some future period the nutritious artery of the bone appears to recover its action, a renewed secretion of bone commences, and the deficient part is thus eventually made good. Upon this principle, cold lotions, and astringent applications, have been generally recommended as the best practice, adding to these, occasional and moderate frictions. The following case is an instance in which ab- sorption of bone was connected with ulceration. Case 11.

OF THE BRAIN. 117 One evening, while lying down on the sofa, he was suddenly attacked with a pain in the small of the back, which was so violent that he could not help crying out repeatedly. This pain he said was most like a burning heat ia the part; it was internal, and not at all affected by external pres- sure. In the course of a quarter of an hour this curious sensation was completely reversed, and although it still distressed him, it was now com- pared to extreme cold; and this, after remaining about an hour, gradually subsided. On the Sd of April a consultation was held, at which Dr. Baillie, Dr. Pemberton, Mr. Heaviside, and Mr. Astley Cooper, were present, and the ex- hibition of mercury was determined on. At first the piL hydrarg. was given every evening, but as it dis- ordered the bowels, it was in a few days changed for the mercurial frictions, administered in the usual manner. His complaints, however, increased every hour, although, while he was under the mercurial treatment, the pain as well as stiffness about the head and neck were evidently much relieved. The first affection of the muscles of respiration was observed during sleep, on the 4th of April. Inspiration was performed quickly, and as if with an effort; this, however, at first disappeared upon ^his waking. On the 7th of April the respiration was very laborious during the day, and the diffi- culty increased every hour. The follawing morn- ing the difficulty became extreme, the lips lost their colour, and in the course of the same after- noon he expired. 1 3

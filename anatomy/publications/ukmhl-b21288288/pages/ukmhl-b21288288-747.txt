IRRITABLE STRICTURE. 205 some, and proves subsequently much less ma- nageable than it was at first. The strictured part of the urethra has acquired so great an increase of irritabihty, that the introduction of a bougie is attended with pain; its being retained in the stricture is productive of much distress, and if under these circumstances it is allowed to remain long in the urethra, but more particularly if the surgeon ventures to pass one a size larger than ordinary, the irritation is so increased that it either excites spasm at the neck of the bladder and retension of urine, or endangers the production of inflammation and abscess in the perinaeum, inflam- mation of the testicle, or some other ill conse- quence. The treatment of this irritable state of stricture will require considerable judgment; for although the degree of the permanent contraction may be so inconsiderable that were the irritation and dis- position to spasm relieved, the urethra might be with ease brought back to its natural state of re- laxation by the bougie, yet whilg the irritation re- mains upon the parts, it is difficult to de]termine, what had better be done, for if let alone the stric- ture is sure to increase, and if meddled with in order to its relief by the bougie, the attempt only serves to aggravate the disease.

-32 AFFECTIONS OF PAETS action, as no pus is produced, neither can any change in the state of the medullary secretions in tlie diploe be allowed for, as in early childhood the bones of the skull are diaphanous. Again, an injury to the head of an adult has required the application of the trephine. From. the natural inequality of the internal surface, it has happened that in removing the central piece of bone, a small scale from the inner table has been split off, so as to be left projecting within the circle. Under these circumstances it has appeared unadvisable to irritate the membranes of the brain by attempting its removal, and it has been con- sequently let alone J and while the dura mater, vibrating with the pulsations of the brain, has preserved all the appearances of health, the almost insulated piece of bone has suffered change, it has been seen to become every day tliinner and more transparent than it was before, until eventually it has completely disappeared. In explanation of the principle upon which ab- sorption of bone from the cranium takes place in infancy, the most rational conclusion seems to be, that external violence may now and then operate by producing a local debility of circulation, so modified as to be just equal to the preserving life in a part, although inadequate to some of the purposes of healthy action. This peculiar measure of debility probably connects itself, as in many other cases, with a correspondent increase in the local irritability, and while the former of these 8

282 ON SOME AFFECTIONS OF THE The appearance of the mesentery was altogether singular. There were as many as three of these preternatural openings through its substance. The two largest are seen in the engraving, and the third was situated very near the root of the mesen- tery; it resembled the others, except in size, but could not be brought distinctly into view with the rest. The whole of the mesentery, but more parti- cularly those parts near the preternatural openings, were very remarkably thin, in many places as thin and transparent as paper, as if from having been exposed to long continued pressure.* This curious state of mesentery can upon this principle only be explained by the supposition that habitual confinement of bowels, and the pressure of the contents, had produced the appearances of absorption or wasting of the mesentery that were found after death. Judging, however, from the state of the parts when examined, there was no evi- dence of the injury having arisen either from full bowels, or hardened faeces, for nothing was found * Plate 4. Fig. 1.

The root of the mesentery, where the structure remained in its natural state, while the other parts of that ex- pansion were rendered extremely thin, in many places being as transparent and nearly as thin as silver paper. i.

The largest of the three openings found upon the mesen- tery : the opening not seen in the engraving, was much i^maller than either of the others.

INFLAMMATORY AFFECTION OF THE KIDNEY. 3 B 2 Sect. 2, 0}i inflmmnatoi^ Affcctioiiy and increased Secretmi of the KidTiey. Almost every complaint to which the kidney is subject maybe connected, more or less, with inflam- matory action, and as the treatment proper for the removal of inflammation must always be taken into account, in the management of those affections in which increased action prevails, it may not be im- proper to enumerate its symptoms in this place. Inflammation of the kidney has been defined, " fever; pain in the region of the kidney; frequent desire to void urine, which is either of a pale, or very red colour; vomiting; numbness of the thigh; retraction, and pain in the testicle of the same side The pain attending in this complaint, al- though in some cases very acute, may be generally distinguished from that produced by rheumatic af- fections of the loins, by its not being materially aggravated by the motions of the trunk of the body. There appears, however, to be no symptom by which we can be enabled with any certainty to de- cide whether the inflammatory action is idiopathic, or whether it is symptomatic of a disposition to form calculous matter, unless this is indicated either by * Cullen.

125 OF THE BRAIN. quently a disturbed state of circulation within the ventricles may be expected to operate much less ex- tensively upon the functions of the brain, than the same kind of derangement would do, taking place upon the membranes covering the whole of that organ externally. The membranes of the brain are frequently af- fected by sympathetic, or translated action. In that state of constitution productive of gouty and rheumatic complaints particularly, this is observed to take place. When for example there is not strength of constitution sufficient for the produc- tion of the regular fit of gout, the attempt will ap- pear to fail, and symptoms of effusion upon the brain immediately follow. * This attack, according to the prevailing state of the habit, may be attended with much or little inflammatory action, or per- haps with none at all. Rheumatic affections of the brain, on the con- trary, are I believe invariably attended with the symptoms of acute inflammation, which circum- stance, if the observation is correct, may sometimes lead to a diagnosis between gouty action falling upon the brain, and that dependent on rheumatism. Beside the above affections, the brain is liable tq suffer from the retrocession of any increased dis- charge, or any external eruptive disorder. Of this I have seen many instances, some terminating fa- tally, and all possessing sufficient importance to de. serve attention. * An interesting though unfortunate instance of this kind, is related in some practical observations on the diseases of the Urinary Organs, which I have lately published. 9

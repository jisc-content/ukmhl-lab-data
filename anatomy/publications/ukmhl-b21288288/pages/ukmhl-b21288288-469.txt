447 BONES OF THE LiMfi. integuments round the basis of the tumor, and the dissection from this line was extended upwards and downwards, so as to expose the muscles and bones above and below the joint of the knee. The knee-joint was sound, and the femur perfectly healthy. On examining the parts behind the knee, a considerable tumor made up of smaller masses, was found pressing out the solaeus mus- cle, and proceeding from the tibia. This mass, when cut into, or pressed, was found to be of a pulpy white structure, resembling that of th^ brain; in several parts it contained small putrid cavities, partially filled with blood. The tibia was separated at the joint, and the upper parts both of tibia and fibula were then divided with a saw about the middle of the leg, to admit of a more accurate subsequent examin- ation of the disease. The anterior parts of the sloughing and bleeding tumor, when the integuments that yet remained w^ere dissected away, exhibited a fungous or gra- nulated mass of red flesh, resembling very much the appearance of a cancerous ulcer. To the feel it was particularly firm, and what appeared curious was, that wherever a small part of the surface of these granulations, one eighth of an inch thick, was shaved off with a scalpel, it cut nearly as firm ^nd as even as cartilage ; it was subsequently ascertained that it derived this firmness from a fine reticulated or honeycomb ossific structure, of which, on further enquiry, it appeared the whole of the large anterior tumor was composed.

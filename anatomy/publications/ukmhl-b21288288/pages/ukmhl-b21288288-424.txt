In a month from the accident, the matter was let out. The puncture was made where the skin was thin- nest, just opposite the middle of the ulna. The discharge of the matter, which was healthy pus, gave great relief. The state of the arm was now examined, and in following with the finger the line of the ulna, an unequal tumefaction of the bone was ascertained, extending nearly the whole length of the fore-arm.

342 ON OVARIAN DROPSY. upon the ovarium from which the impregnated ovum is to be expelled, and over which the fim- brise of the Fallopian tube expand themselves. Upon the expulsion of the ovum, it is carried along the tube into the uterus, and the excitement that first existed upon tlie surface of the ovarium, and corresponding.extremity of the Fallopian tube, is by concurrent circumstances securely diverted from thence, by necessarily passing with the ovum along the Fallopian tube, and at last resting with it in the cavity of the uterus, is there productive of all the interesting and beautiful phenomena of new vascu- larity and hourly increasing magnitude, with the subsequent curious succession of developement of parts, till the full period of gestation is completed, by which time the original excitement produced upon the ovarium has entirely subsided. If we pass forward, and consider the succeeding links of.the same chain, the principal circumstances attendant upon delivery, the considerable loss, first of blood, and then of the thinner excretions from the cavity of the uterus subside so gradually as to. afibrd ad- ditional bonds of security as relate to the state of the ovarium. Hence also may be derived the strongest reasons in favour of a parent suclding her own child. But when, on the other hand, the excitement of the ovary is derived from any acci- dental cause, the impression not conveyed and di- rected by the Fallopian tube to one point only, dif- fuses itself over all the parts of the ovarium, and instead of being confined to a single ovum, the whole contents of the ovarium are more or les3

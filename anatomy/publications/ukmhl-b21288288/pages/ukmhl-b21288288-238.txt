222 AFFECTIONS OF THE LUNGS. Case 66. A Nail dropt into the Trachea, and subsequently rejected* James Butler, aged sixty-five, employed by Chip- peiidale, of St. Martin's Lane, was working in the repair^ of an ornamented cieling. He had two nails in his mouth, and while looking upward at his work, a little irritation set him coughing, when one of the nails was thrown out of his mouth, and the other, in recovering his breath, to use nis own words, Â« slipt down his wind-pipe." Incessant irritation, pain, and cough," directly followed, and so continued till the man was worn away to a skeleton; spitting up blood, and mucous phlegm. ^ All the Faculty who were consulted, pronounced his case hopeless ; and if rightly represented, (in themselves convinced, that had such an occurrence taken place, it must quickly have proved fatal,) assured him it went down into the stomach, and must have passed off" through the bowels. They said that what he experienced arose from the irri- tation it produced when in the stomach, but that it was not in his lungs as he imagined, or sus- pected. Dr. Pitcairn, Mr. Cruickshanks, and others saw him. Mr. K. of St. Martin's Lane, was with him directly after it happened. Prescriptions mitigated his sufferings a little, but could not remove them. * The following account is transcribed from the original, which^ together with the.nail itself, is preserved in Mr. Heaviside's Museum.

20 CALCULOUS AFFECTION diicing the very evil which it had previously re- moved. In other words, should the administration either of magnesia or the alkahes be persevered in after the uric acid has disappeared, they almost al- ways occasion a copious deposition of the phos- phates ; these salts being now found in as great abundance in the urine as the uric acid had be- fore been. Neither is the production of the white sand materially less distressing to the patient in the irritation it produces, than the evolution of the red gravel. When things take this turn, the case requires a considerable degree of attention, in watching the alternate vibrations of the beam, until at last the balance is brought to an exact equilibrium, and the patient's health is restored. If, as above stated, by the too long use of alkaline medicines, the ex- cess of uric acid has given way and a precipitation of the phosphates has taken place, the alkaline remedies must of course be immediately laid aside, and instead of them the muriatic acid may be directed, under the influence of which the secre- tion of the phosphates will soon be observed to ^ give way, but as the use of this, or either of the other mineral acids are known to favour the re- production of the red sand, they also must be watched with care, for this elfect may in general be prevented easily enough by laying them aside in time.

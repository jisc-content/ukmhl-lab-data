ON HERNIA. ^3 u 3 Case 85. Scrotal Hernia^ tsoith Adhesions^ and Disease. On Saturday morning, May 29, 1813, I was sent for to see a stout man, forty years of age^ who was said to be in great pain, from a large irre-^ ducible hernia. On visiting him, he was suffering from severe uneasiness rather than acute pain^ about the seat of the rupture, which was upon the left side. It was equal in size to a small melonv He acquainted me that it was an old rupture, and that eighteen months before, it was easily kept up by a truss, but that latterly he had neglected to wear the instrument, and his rupture consequently could not now be got u][) at all. He complained of a good deal of uneasiness and pain about the lower part of the abdomen. Hff had passed a motion easily on the preceding even-' ing, and his bowels had been regular before that time. There was no sickness at the stomach., Handling the tumor produced no increase of his pain in the abdomen, nor any pain at all in the part. With a view to its reduction, the scrotum was carefully and steadily supported in the one hand, while with the other, parts occupying the neck of the hernial sac, were successively pressed on in the proper line of the abdominal opening j but after some perseverance, the attempt was relinquished,. as not likely to succeed, although the gurgling feel of intestine was very evident in the tumor. He was ordered a purgative medicine, and directed to be brought into the Infirmary, where he conti- nued to sink, and the same evening died.

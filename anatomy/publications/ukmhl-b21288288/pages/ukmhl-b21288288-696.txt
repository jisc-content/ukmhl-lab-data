154< INTRODUCTION OF THE CATHETER. In the operation of introducing a catheter it will generally happen that success is rather attributable to attentive perseverance than to the application of any considerable degree of force, which should always be avoided. The making too much pres- sure with the instrument will almost always excite unnecessary irritation, it may do considerable mis- chief, but will scarcely ever forward the accom- plishment of the object in view. '- 'In some instances however, the flexible catheter cannot by any means be made to pass into the bladder. Under these circumstances, should the retention of urine be complete, we must endeavour to introduce the silver catheter, and by varying the direction of the point, together with the degree of pressure applied, it will in general overcome the resistance and pass into the bladder. Should the attempt to introduce the silver ca- theter have succeeded, but with considerable diffi- culty, the instrument had better be allowed to remain some short time in the bladder, with a view to the leaving an impression of its figure upon the sides of the tumor, which will materially faci- litate the subsequent introduction of a flexible gum catheter of the same size, which being pre- viously laid ready, should be passed into the bladder immediately the silver catheter is with- drawn.

SYMPTOMS OF STONE. / ' where it has proceeded to the extent of inflamma- tion. There is another very curious circumstance, that has often been observed under the use of alka- line medicines", a circumstance which, according to my mode of explaining it, is directly attributable to the effect they produce upon the bladder,â€”I mean that particular state of bladder in which a sac, or cyst, is formed. Examinations after death, in cases where a stone has been long known to have existed, and where by the exhibition of the alkalies the symptoms have en- tirely disappeared, have shewn that the calculus has remained entire, but the circumstances under which it is placed have been altered, instead of its lying, as at first, loose in the bladder, it is found confined in a little recess, and is prevented from doing fur- ther mischief; in consequence of which change, instead of the bladder being, as dissection teaches us every irritable bladder must be, contracted, thick- ened, and its inner membrane highly vascular, it is found larger than common, relaxed, soft and pulpy in texture, and not unfrequently even gangrenous upon its internal surface ; not that gangrene which supervenes upon excessive action and excitement, but a chronic change evidently arising from extreme debility in the vital powers of the part, and totally independent of any appearances of preceding in- creased action, such as effused lymph, or exten^ve ulceration upon the inner membrane.

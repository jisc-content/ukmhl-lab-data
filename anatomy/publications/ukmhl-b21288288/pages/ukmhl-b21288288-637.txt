95 OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY. Sect. 3. On the various Modes of performing the Operation of Lithotomy.

The operation for the stone has been variously performed at various periods of time, and most of the alterations that have successively been made, may be considered as so many improvements in the art of surgery. The earliest idea was that of cutting out the stone at the perineum. Two fingers of the left hand were introduced into the rectum, to enable the operator to press the stone forward against the perinseum, and the wound being made with a knife, was enlarged to a sufficient extent to allow the calculus to be protruded into it; and the stone being then hooked out, the operation was finished. This was the mode adopted and described by Celsus. * But the operation performed in this way was liable to many objections and dangers, the prin- cipal of which was removed by Fabricius Hildanus Lib. vii. cap. a6.

This negligence has perhaps, m great measure, arisen from the cases alluded to being of a peculiar description, for which surgery can afford little or no relief. This reason, how- ever, or rather excuse, for inattention to any of the operations that take place in the living body, is but ill calculated to forward the improvement of the most interesting, and unquestionably the most use- ful of all Arts. To know how to preserve Hfe, cer- tainly requires that we should have some acquaint- ance with its laws; and to acquire the power of assisting the natural operations of a living body, surely requires that we should have informed our- selves, as extensively as possible, regarding the modes and principles of action in living parts. One question that naturally occurs is the follow- ing/--Is the capsular ligament of a joint neces- sarily ruptured in dislocation, or not? Upon t'nis point experience certainly proves that in som6 in- stances, rupture of the capsular ligament takes place, but not in the majority.

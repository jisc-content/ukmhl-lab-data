The urine is in some instances tolerably clear, but more frequently the quantity of mucous matter thrown off from the inner membrane of the bladder is considerably increased, becoming also much more dense, and consistent than natural; the quan- tity when the symptoms are urgent, frequently ex- ceeds that of the urine in which it is suspended.

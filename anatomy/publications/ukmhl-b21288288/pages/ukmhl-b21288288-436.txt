ON DISEASE IN THE BONES 416 sarily rendered the actions of the finger very im- perfect; added to which, the junction between the new bone and the old articulating surface, ended in anchylosis. * The various actions of the animal machine are so constituted in mutual dependance upon each other, that in disease as well as in health, new resources still appear, the aptitude and ingenuity of which it is impossible to consider without admiration; and indeed, when we reflect on these matters, with due attention, it is difificult to reject the idea of some invisible agency ever attending us, for the express purpose of regulating the movements of so compli- cated a system as that of the animal economy, al- though were our researches in this branch of philo- sophy sufficiently advanced, we should most pro- bably perceive that the important functions assigned by an eminent German physiologistt to a Spiritus Archseus, necessarily result from a regular series of * Plate 5.

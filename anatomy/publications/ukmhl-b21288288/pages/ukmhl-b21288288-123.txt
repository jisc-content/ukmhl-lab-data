OF THE BRAIN. 107 vulsion were more frequent than ever, but diminish- ed in duration and intensity ; attended with more relaxation of skin, less congestion in the head, and less injury to the intellect than formerly. The paroxysm did not continue above a minute, when the skin fell suddenly pale, and a copious sweat broke forth. In the progress of the night, the thirst was very distressing. The forehead and^ face were still incommoded by transient flushes of heat. He complained of pain in the ear, by the divided artery. The early re-establishment and controul the mind now exerted over the body was truly astonishing. Even while the convulsions were still upon his limbs, and his respiration stertorous, he would reach out his hand for his handkerchief; and endeavour to wipe his lips, as 1 have seen in partial attacks of tetanus. He had taken medicine repeatedly, but could get no evacuation, although distressed by tenesmus. The interval between the fits was now 15,10, and once only five minutes. In the paroxysm the pulse was regular, but hard. Saturday, October 15. This morning, the com- press and bandage from the temporal artery were removed entirely. The opening was in a state of suppuration. The day passed pretty quietly. The pulse was at 100. This morning he had a stool. Hi& mind was more tranquil and collected, than for several days before. The longest interval this day, was six hours. In the evening he fell into a very sound sleep, sometimes snoring extremely loud. The servants fancied it a sign of improve- ment, but it had more the appearance of coma.

OF THE LARYNX. 149 confined to any particular age,, for I have seen it take place at different periods of life. Where, however, the state of the habit is strongly- disposed to phlegmonous action, the inflammation shews less disposition to spread, but the increased action is of a more decided character. The coagulable lymph is effused in its pure state, and assumes a compact form. In this case it has a whiter colouf, and is more firm and tenacious than in the other. The matter thrown up may be blend- ed with mucus, but with little purulent fluid, and by washing, the coagulated lymph is readily sepa- rated from the purulent or mucous matter, but in the former case it is not so. The latter is the most favourable form of the disease, as from this the patient may recover. The coagulable lymph is coughed up, entangled with the mucous secretion, from the trachea. The appearance of it, in several preparations, * from young persons who did recover, is very beautifully reticulated. The favourable issue of these cases affords the best proof of the in- flammation not having formed a very 'extended sphere of surrounding irritation passing down into the lungs, as takes place in the typhoid state of con- stitution. The two following cases, which occurred in St. George's Hospital t, afford a clear and satisfac- tory history of the symptoms and appearances of this complaint, as it most usually takes place, in grown persons. * Preserved in Mr. Heaviside's Museum, t Communicated by Mr. Hamerton.

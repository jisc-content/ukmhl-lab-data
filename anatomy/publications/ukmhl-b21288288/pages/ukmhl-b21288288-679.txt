I have in one instance seen a very curious and singular affection of the prostate gland produced by injecting to cure a gonorrhsea. It was a species of irritation, connected with a spasmodic action of the muscles surrounding the bulbous part of the urethra. As the circumstances of this case were singular and interesting, it will be again noticed in its place. * The variety of appearances that are found when the prostate gland is affected with disease, seems in many instances to arise from some one portion be- ing more disposed than the rest to run into an un- healthy action ; for it commonly happens that either one of the lateral parts, or the small posterior lobe, takes the lead, and is found more considerably en- larged, or more materially altered from its natural state, than the other parts of the gland.

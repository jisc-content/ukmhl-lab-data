OF THE STERNUM. This principle may, perhaps, give some support to an opinion I have formed with regard to the sternum, leading me to believe, that this bone is particularly subject, in certain constitutions, to feel the changes of atmosphere, and the impressions that arise from cold. The instances, however, in which I have yet had an opportunity of making this observation, are few in number; the two first were in habits apparently inclined to scrofulous action, although without ^ exhibiting any one distinct character of the dis- ease 5 the third seemed altogether independent of this cause, and was considered as an attack of rheumatism. Case 51. Tumw of the Sternum. The first case that particularly attracted my at- tention, occurred at Gibraltar in August, 1805. It was in a poor man, about 40 years of age, one of the privates in the ISth regiment of foot. He made complaint with much alarm, of a pain in his breast, which he had lately been very sub- ject to, and which was greatly aggravated by cough- ing or exercise. This, he said, was attended with an external swelling. On examination a tumor was found, seated upon the first bone of the ster- num, and connected apparently with the cartilages of the left upper ribs. The convexity of this swelling was even and gradual. The surface of the sternum at this part, was apparently raised half an inch beyond the general surface of the bone.

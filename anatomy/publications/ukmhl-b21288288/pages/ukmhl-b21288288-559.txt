INFLAMMATION IN THE KIDNEY. 17 the attack usually appears to come on without any sufficiently obvious or satisfactory exciting cause. It sometimes happens that, towards the turn of life, there shall be an attempt made to produce a new disease in the constitution, or at least one new to the patient who has never experienced it before. When this takes place, should the strength of the constitution be materially deficient, or should the treatment of the apparent symptoms be carelessly conducted, the chances are very unfavourable, from the probability of the disease settling itself upon some vital organ, an event which generally termi- nates fatally. I have seen sevei-al remarkable iifstances of the gout making its first appearance in this way. In one, the great toe at first became tender, and some- what inflamed, but this in a day or two went off upon the sudden accession of paralysis, from which notwithstanding every thing proper was done for his relief, the patient never recovered, although he continued for some few years to drag on a miserable existence. Two other instances of the same de- scription, in which the kidneys were concerned, will be noticed with the cases. c

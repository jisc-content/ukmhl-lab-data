The body in general, was emaciated, and the abdomen much distended by a tumor, apparently of a solid nature. When the parietes were cut through, the peri- toneum was found so diseased, and so firmly adhe- rent to the mass of intestines, that the accurate separation or distinction of parts was almost im- practicable. The whole intestinal canal was in- volved in one confused mass, in which the liver, part of the stomach, and the whole of the other abdominal viscera, were included.

DISEASED PROSTATE GLAND. 16*9 ral of these it was connected to the peritoneum above the pubes. The bladder felt thickened, and on pressing it, a jet of urinous fluid sprung out irom a particular part of its surface. On examin- ing this part carefully with a probe, a small hole was found, through which the instrument passed at once into the cavity of the bladder. By cutting upon the.probe, this opening was en- larged, so as to lay open the whole cavity cf the bladder. It appeared from the examination, that the im- mediate cause of death had been the inflammation of the peritoneum, caused by the escape of the urine into the abdomen, through a small ulcer in- the coats of the bladder. Several small partially ulcerated spots were found upon the inner mem- brane of the bladder, although it was only at one point that the ulceration had reached to the peri- toneal covering, through which the urine had burst into the general cavity. The prostate gland was very much enlarged, and had a considerable abscess formed within its sub- stance. This abscess had extended itself by form- ing sinuses for some extent beyond the surface of the gland, passing between the diseased and thick- ened coats of the bladder. The diseased state of the prostate gland had in this case most probably operated by its irritation, so as to produce that affection of the mucous mem-

140 ON THE AFFECTIONS It has, however, occurred to me to see in one instance a very extensive internal injury to the brain, from the force with which the blood was driven into the head of the infant, daring labour ; the circumstances of the case are the following: Case 37. Extravasation of Blood mthin the Head, i?i diffkidt Labour. A middle aged woman, whose pelvis was consi- derably deformed, after a most difficult labour of three days' continuance, was delivered of an appa- rently still-born infant. The child was large, and the head, which was of full size, was exceedingly flattened, in consequence of the projection of the sacrum into the cavity of the pelvis. Every proper exertion was made to restore the infant, and by the assistance of artificial respiration the motion of the heart was re-excited, and as long as the respiration was kept up, so long the circulation was supported; but when that was discontinued, this also failed. By these means the heart was kept going for nearly twelve hours, but on the artificial respiration being finally abandoned, the lips became blue, and the body, in which no attempt at voluntary motion had been observed, soon became cold. Immediately the child was born, a soft tumor of some extent was observed beneath the scalp upon the vertex of the head. This had the feel of fluid, deposited between the scalp and the cranium. In the course of the following day the head was examined.

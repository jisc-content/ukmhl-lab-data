Hinde, aged -24, was admitted into the St. George's Infirmary, December 23d, 179^^, with a large tumour in the right hypogastrium, attended with excruciating pains, symptomatic fever, and a periodical discharge of menstrual blood. The pam and fever were mitigated by salines and antispas- modic fomentations, &c.; after which the infus. querci: was given, which restrained the menstrual discharge, and she recovered strength. On a more minute inquiry into the cause, du- ration, &c. of her complaints, she gave the follow- ing particulars. Three years before, she had be- come pregnant, went her full time, and was de- livered of a male child. She recovered well, but a short time after, having words with a man she cohabited with, he gave her a violent blow with his foot on the lower part of the belly, just above the pubes. In consequence of this she fell ill, complaining of a violent pain in the part bruised, attended with a slight fever. Some medical person was called m, and m a tew days by proper medicines, the symptoms were removed, and she got perfectly well, so as to go about her usual employments as before. She continued well near twelve months, and was * Extracted from a MS. in Mr. Heaviside's Museum, where the Uterus itself is preserved.

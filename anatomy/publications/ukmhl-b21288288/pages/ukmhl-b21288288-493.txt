469 AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. H H S But in those cases where the relaxed state of the capsular ligament has admitted of the head of the bone being completely dislocated, the mode in which the parts are invited to assist in promot- ing the restoration of power to the joint, varies in conformity with the variation in the means re- quired for the accompHshment of the purpose. In the former instance, two operations were necessary, in the present only one. In the former it was necessary to remove a part of the head of the bone, and to provide a support for that portion which fell beyond the natural limits of the articulation; in the latter the process of removal or absorption was not wanted, and the whole consequently rested with that power by which new bone was to be deposited.. The head of the humerus thrown en- tirely out from its glenoide cavity, reposed itself against the neck of the scapula. The irritation produced in the strained part of the capsule, na- turally extended itself to the vessels of the adjacent periosteum, not only by the margin of the capsular ligament, but also by that part of the external sur- face of the membrane which was interposed be- tween the luxated head of the humerus and the neck of the scapula, where the capsule of the joint and the periosteum must have been in contact. e. A part of the new surface produced by absorption, upon the head of the humerus, where it is opposed to the original glenoide cavity of the scapula. f. That part of the head of the humerus, received upon the newly produced surface of articulation.

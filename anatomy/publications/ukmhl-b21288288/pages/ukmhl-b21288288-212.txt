ON SOME OF THE, &C. 196 and in proportion as by rest he recovered his proper colour, his natural powers for exercise were restored to him. For some time previous to his decease, his constitution was evidently on the de- cline, without there being any further indication of particular disease or complaint. He seemed to fail, from the constitution not possessing sufficient energy to carry him forward to a state of perfect growth. Examination, On opening the chest, the heart was found over- loaded with black, grumous blood. The coronary vessels were highly injected, but with black blood only. Upon laying open the cavities of the heart, the aorta was found inserted over both ventricles, communicating with the right, as well as left side of the heart. A part of the septum ventriculorum, of a semicircular figure, was deficient, opposite to the insertion of the basis of the aorta; the breadth of this space was equal to the diameter of the artery. The margin of the septum at this part had something of a ligamentous feel, when ex- amined by the finger. In other respects the heart was perfectly natural. The only defect in this instance, was in the dis- position of the artery, from which defect both ventricles poured their blood into the aorta. The pulmonary vessels were perfect in every respect, but, in examining the origin of the aorta, the finger passed with equal freedom by either ventricle into the cavity of the artery; and with such a construc- tion of heart it is obvious that only a very insuffi-

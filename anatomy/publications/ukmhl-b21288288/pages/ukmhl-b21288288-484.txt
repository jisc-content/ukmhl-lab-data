ON DISLOCATION this State may be extremely various, I have m a fe\V instances had very clear evidence. In a series of very beautiful drawings executed by Rymsdyk*, from a dissection of a dislocated shoulder, the capsular ligament was so completely rent, that the whole head of the humerus had been protruded through it; and in a wet preparation in the same collection, the preserved parts prove that the same :hing may occasionally happen to the head of the femur. From the figure of the bones, it appears that the patient was a young person, about sixteen or seventeen. The dislocation is upward, and backward, and the ligaraentum teres is entirely separated from the head of the thigh bone, which has been forced completely through the capsule of the joint. On the other hand, I have attended, and pre- served notes of several instances of dislocated shoulder, where from the situation of the head of the bone, it appeared, not only that the capsular ligament remained entire, but that it had been the means of preventing the bone from being so com- pletely thrown out from its natural situation, as it would otherwise have been. One of the most striking instances of this kind will be presently mentioned. In these cases the capsular ligament by prevent- ing the entire removal of the head of the humerus from its articulating cavity, affords a material as- sistance to the surgeon in his efforts towards re- * Preserved in the portfolios of Me.

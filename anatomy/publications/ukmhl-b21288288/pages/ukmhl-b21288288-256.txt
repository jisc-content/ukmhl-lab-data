238 ON SOME AFFECTIONS Mercury is held to be a stimulant; its effect upon the constitution is called excitement, for it certainly rouses the actions of tlie body, and much increases the quickness and force of the heart's action. Every case of acute inflammation is a state of local excitement, and the use of those means known to operate by stimulating, are there- fore held objectionable. Upon this principle, mer- cury is generally recommended in chronic affections, but not in acute inflammatory action of the liver. But in the case just related, there was not only proof of inflammatory action by the internal symp- toms, but also from the local appearances, there was ground to believe, suppuration was at hand, consistent with what we learn by dissection, as to the manner in which diseased parts assist them- selves. There was reason to presume, that effu- sion and consequent adhesion had established itself between the anterior part of the liver, and the adjacent parietes of the abdomen, and this car- ries the idea beyond mere inflammation, as it is a preparatory step to the transmission of the con- tents of an abscess, and perhaps very rarely, if ever, proceeds to the length marked above, un- less where suppuration takes place.

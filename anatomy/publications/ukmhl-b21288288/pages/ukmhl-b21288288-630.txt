APPEARANCES AND STRUCTURE Sect. 13, Of the Appearances and Structure of Urinary Calculi. There is considerable variety in the appearance and structure of the calcuU met with in the urinary bladder. It has been already observed that the concretions usually formed in the kidneys are prin- cipally composed of uric acid j but calculi that have been produced in the bladder are commonly found to be made up either of phosphate of lime, or the triple phosphate; unless they assume the mulberry form, when they consist of oxalate of lime; or where a nucleus of uric acid has come down from the kidney, while the urine has still continued to be loaded with an excess of uric acid, in which case the deposit commenced in the pelvis of the kidney, con- tinues to increase in the cavity of the bladder, and in this way the uric calculus has become much larger, previous to the cessation of the secretion of an excess of mic acid. When however this pecu- liar action has once subsided, the future increase of the calculus most frequently depends on a depo- sition of the phosphates. In occasional instances however, the increased secretion of uric acid has re- turned at intervals, and in these cases the calculus has been found to be composed of alternate layers of uric acid and tlie phosphates.

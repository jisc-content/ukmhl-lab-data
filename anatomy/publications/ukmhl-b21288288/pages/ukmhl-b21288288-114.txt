The arteries in the brain, from continued distention, and fatigue, seemed to have lost very much of their tone. It is remarkable that they evinced no disposition whatever to increase of action, or inflammation, till they were partially emp- tied by the means adopted for their relief; then indeed, there were pains in the head, more decided irritability about the nerves of sense, and other marks of action, which, in my opinion, may be much more justly considered an effort of nature to re-as- sume her proper functions in the economy, than as evincing any disposition to disease. It was from this view of the case that salines and opiates were called upon, to complete what de- pletion had begun ; and the event appeared Upon the whole, to establish the propriety of the princi- ple upon which the treatment had been conducted. The doubtful nature of the following case, as to whether the convulsion was principally derived from fulness of vessels, or especially produced from irri- tation; the unsatisfactory effects of the various modes of treatment adopted; the close attention I paid to the progress of the disease : and the opportunity of examining the contents of the head after deatli, have induced me to give a more complete detail of the progress of the symptoms tan I should other- wise have done.

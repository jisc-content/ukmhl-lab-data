During the first bleeding, he did once move his fingers and fore-arm a little, but subsequently he remained totally without sense or motion. At the first bleeding his pulse was at 60, in the course of a few hours it fell to 54, and 50. The following morning, 3 o'clock, he died. Examination. The pia matral vessels were found unusually turgid, and loaded with blood. In paring away the superior part of each hemisphere, distinct un- dulation, and great general distention of the lateral ventricles, were perceived, previous to these cavities being opened. A puncture was made into one of them, when fluid and coagulated blood poured out in considerable quantity. The ventricles were then laid open. The septum lucidum was so lacerated and broken up by the volume of the extravasated blood, that its remains were traced with difficulty. Both the lateral ventricles were reduced to one general cavity, all the parts of which had suffered equally by the effusion. The grumous blood being removed, the sui'faces of the corpora striata, and thalami nervi optici, were perceived to be disturbed. They were torn up, lacerated, and destroyed, to an extent that can hardly be described. From the appearance of these parts, it was very clear the arteries that had

128 FUNGUS H^MATODES OF THE BLADDER. She was herself disposed to consider her pains were rheumatic, because they were still occasionally a good deal connected with the loins, upon which account she begged to be allowed to apply a blister to the loins, and one was ordered. Upon the blis- ter taking effect she for the first time felt, and men- tioned something of a swelling that was taking place in the lower part of the belly. Upon feeling the parts the following day the tumor was evident and considerable; it was fixed and firm, situated in the region of the bladder immediately above the pubes ; it felt as if firmly fixed to the bones of the pelvis, and was nearly as hard as a scirrlius disease. From the long course of preceding haemorrhage from the bladder, and from the feel of the tumor, there seemed to be some ground for suspicion that it might be produced by a mass of coagulated blood filling up the cavity of the bladder, added to which, the external feel of the swelling a good deal re- sembled that of a case already mentioned, in which the bladder was found full of blood. * She fancied the blister had somewhat relieved the pain in the back, but not that in the bladder, al- though she did not find herself in more pain, either about the bladder, or between that and the loins, upon the appearance of the tumor, than she had been before. * See Page 60.

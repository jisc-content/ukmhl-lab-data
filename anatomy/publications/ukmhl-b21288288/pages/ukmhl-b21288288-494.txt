470 ON DISLOCATION Under these circumstances an adhesion was formed, with abundance of new vessels shooting between the connected surfaces of the membranes, and this medium afforded eventually an additional facility for the more abundant deposition of ossific matter, and the consequently increased firmness of the adventitious ossific structure destined to support the head of the bone, in the motions of the joint. The only instance I have yet seen, in which the completely dislocated humerus entirely recovered its powers of action by the process just explained, was met with accidentally in looking over some diseased bones. * A very complete glenoide cavity Was formed, which allowed the head of the hu- merus free motion in every direction. The upper part of the humerus is preserved with the scapula, and shews that the head of the bone has not lost its natural figure, t By attending to the treatment and union of fractures, we have an opportunity of observing, * In the Collection of Mr. Wilson, teacher of Anatonay in Great Windmill Street, who, in the most polite manner, allowed me to take a drawing of the preparation. f Plate 8.

The new glenoide cavity, well supported by a consider, able mass of ossific matter, upon the surface of which the numerous perforations demonstrate the spaces by which the membranous septa, and circulating vessels passed into the structure of tlie newly formed arti- culating cavity.

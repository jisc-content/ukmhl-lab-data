The bowels were greatly relaxed, and very active. had no pain or uneasiness in the head, but felt considerable pain in the upper part of the paralyzed arm, of which he could not move a fin- ger. The foot and leg on the same side were be- coming oedematous. The form of the convulsive attacks was now somewhat altered. The eyes and face were still, as formerly, affected first; but the chest was fixed, and the breast did not heave till the close of the fit. This change had taken place by very slow de- grees. The respiration formerly had been con- tinued, but with labour, and foaming at the mouth, and some degree of stertor. Now, on the contrary, by an universal spasm which seized upon the whole muscular parietes of the chest, the air was at once expelled from the lungs with a sort of scream, and the thorax was compressed to the greatest possible degree. During the spasm, the face and lips as- sumed a dark livid colour. In about half a minute, the violence of the spasm began to abate, the breast again moved, and the air, by short starts, was drawn into the lungs, with a sort of fluttering action of the muscles; and the organs of respir- ation, after a few minutes, settled into a very lan- guid state of their proper action. The vital func- tions generally decline together; the pulse, at the time the spasm was its height, could not now be felt for the space of several pulsations.

If the discharge from the external orifice of the urethra has dis- appeared, the warm bath and fomentations will tend to its restoration; and to these means, if neces- sary, may be added the application of some irritat- ing matter, such as the bals. copaibi, to the urethra, by means of a bougie.

It has been observed above, that the only in- stances in which I have been able to trace disease of structure arising spontaneously in the coats of the bladder, were in cases of fungus haematodes. In these the common symptoms that arise from irrit- ation in the bladder, were the only decided cha- racters that attended the production of the disease. Towards the latter periods, however, there was occasional bleeding in the one case, and more severe haemorrhagy in the other; but in neither was it possible, during the life of the patient, to form any clear or satisfactory opinion as to the precise nature of the complaint. In this disease we have little in our power, as in this, like the other affections of the bladder ap- proaching to the nature of cancer, there are no means at present known to be within our reach, for attempting the removal of the disease.

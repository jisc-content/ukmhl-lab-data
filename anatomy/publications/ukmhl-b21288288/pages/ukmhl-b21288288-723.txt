OF THE URETHRA. 181 N 3 end that projects from the penis, in a horizontal position. If the action of the urethra is then watched with attention, it will be found that the power which expels the instrument, in other words the contraction of the urethra, is uniform through its whole extent. The point of the bougie is not pushed forward more quickly while it moves through. the bulb of the urethra, where the canal is surrounded with strong muscles, than it is afterward, but on the contrary, its motion is exceeding slow and perfectly equal throughout, until the whole of the instrument is expelled, and the point fairly drops from the orifice of the urethra. Late authors may say this is clearly the elasticity of the living membrane, and perhaps had the bougie been passed only to the extent of half an inch into the urethra, its expulsion upon this principle might admit of doubt; but when the instrument has been intro- duced several inches, the advocates for elasticity forget that while the membrane of the urethra is exerting itself, for one-eighth of an inch to push forward the end of the bougie, the same power is operating against it to the superior extent of several inches, and that the considerable friction from so extensive a surface of contact must prevent the possibility of elasticity having any thing to do in the expulsion of the instrument. It has been distinctly explained by one of the

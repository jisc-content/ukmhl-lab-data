The irritation arising from stone in the bladder is frequently productive of the most extreme tor- ment, and from the contact of the stone with the surface of the inflamed membrane hning the neck of the bladder, it is not uncommon for the vessels to give way, in which event the urine is more or less tinged with blood. This kind of bleeding however, rarely proceeds to such an extent as to deposit a coagulum at the bottom of the vessel in which the urine is received, although this has sometimes happened.

The suppuration within the limb continued, and there was now a constant oozing of matter from all the external openings. In March 1815, a httle pustule made its appearance about the middle of the thigh. A. drop of matter found its way through the skin, and in wiping it away she observed that the cloth caught a small point, which on feeling it, she concluded was a needle that had somehow or other, got into her thigh. It turned out, however, to be a small spicula, connected with the diseased femur, which on examination, was ascertained to be separated leather below its middle. The deformity in the figure of the limb became every day more obvious, until at length the irrita-, ble state of the parts exciting frequent spasmodic action in the muscles, the two parts of the thigh were brought to lay at right angles with each other.

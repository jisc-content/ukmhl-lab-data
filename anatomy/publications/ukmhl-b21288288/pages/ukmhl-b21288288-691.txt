IN THE PROSTATE GLAND. 149 tation comes on about the bladder, an irritation in- finitely more severe than any former attack, which almost prevents the introduction of any instrument being endured, and is attended with frequent eva- cuation of dark coloured blood with the urine, there will be some ground to apprehend that the disease is taking this particular turn. Small calculous concretions are occasionally met with in the cavities of the abscess, in diseased pros- tate gland. In some instances it has appeared pro- bable that these calculi have been dropped acci- dentally into this situation in their way out from the bladder, but in others, the peculiar porcellane- oQs polish which renders them very similar in ap- pearance to small pearls would argue a difference in composition between these and the more com- mon kinds of urinary calculi.

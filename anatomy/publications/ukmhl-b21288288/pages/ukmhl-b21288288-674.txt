In all other respects the disease of the bladder and that of the lumbal glands was precisely the same. Subsequent to my seeing the above case I was re- quested * to open the body of a lady, who had died about the turn of life. She had upon the whole been ailing for a longer period of time than the patient I had myself attended j for the progress of the dis- ^ ease had been much more slow. She had latterly passed blood with her urine, but for a shorter time previous to her death than happened in the above case; neither was there in this instance any tumov to be felt externally, but in other respects the symp- toms were in both cases exactly the same. On examining the body the appearances were found less striking than in the dissection just de- tailed, but in essential points they were very much alike.

182 STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS, &C. highest authorities in the profession *, that the urethra is not only muscular, but that its canal, like all other muscular tubes in the body, is in particular cases susceptible of partial contraction, or spasm, and that this spasm constitutes one kind of stricture in the urethra; and really, the evidence which every day's experience affords upon this point is so clear, that even supposing .the mind to be raised superior to any regard for the successful labours of others, it still seems unaccountable that any person should feel disposed to affirm that the urethra has no muscular power, and con- sequently, that spasm has nothing to do in its diseases; more especially as comparative anatomy demonstrably proves that in the larger animals, particularly in the horse, where structure is more readily developed, and where the functions of the urethra are precisely the same in every respect as in the human subject, the strong muscular fibres encircling the urethra cannot be overlooked.

Of the Nature of Spasmodic Stricture, As the urethra is a membranous canal, sur- rounded externally by a series of muscular fibres, its being occasionally subject to an excessive degree * Mr. J.

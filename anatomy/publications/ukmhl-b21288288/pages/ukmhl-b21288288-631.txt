* See Calculus, Plate i. Fig. 4. OF URINARY CALCULI. ^9 The nacleiis of a calculus from the bladder is generally formed of uric acid, a circumstance that always argues the stone having been originally de- rived from the kidneys *. It is much less common to find the central part composed of a little loosely agglutinated ammoniaco magnesian phosphate, the surrounding mass consisting of the same substance, together with variable proportions of phosphate of lime; but the most rare, and perhaps the most pure species of urinary concrete, is the mulberry calcu- lus, which frequently consists throughout of little else than oxalate of lime. Where, from accidental circumstances, any extra- neous body has made its way into the bladder, the deposit that takes place around it is found to be a mixture of the phosphates j and in this way a small coagulum of blood, a common pea, a hazle nut, a needle, or a bougie, have each of them occasionally become the nucleus upon which calculous matter has been precipitated. The external characters of urinary concretions are various. Those that are composed of uric acid, - are easily distinguished by their red or deep yellow colour ; they may have a smooth surface, but it is frequently rough and warty. Such as contain the uric acid deposited in combination with the ammo- niaco magnesian phosphate, are of a pale or grey

OO IRRITATION FROM GRAVEL. ^ larity, and an increased secretion from the inner membrane of the bladder; but the mischief fre- quently goes further than this, and from the mucous membrane not having been able to defend itself â€¢with equal effect at all points, the minute crystals of calculous matter, partially involved in the secreted mucus, have come into contact with the inner membrane, exciting an excessive inflammatory ac- tion, with effusion of coagulable lymph. By this means the particles of gravel, although they are in some degree removed from the surface of the in- flamed membrane by the interposed stratum of lymph, become permanently fixed in their situation, by the coagulation of the effused fluid. It is this process that gives rise to certain appear- ances occasionally found in diseased bladder, much resembling partial slough, attached to the sur- face of the inner membrane, but upon a closer exa- mination they are obviouslypatches of effused lymph., covered with rough particles of calculous matter, firmly adherent to them. Here then we may see the effect of the successive efforts of the constitutional powers to prevent the continued application of an irritating matter to the membrane lining the bladder. First, the natural mucus is thrown off in greater abundance than be- fore ; but should this not answer the purpose, the cause still produces the effect, for as the irritation increases, the consistence, as well as quantity of

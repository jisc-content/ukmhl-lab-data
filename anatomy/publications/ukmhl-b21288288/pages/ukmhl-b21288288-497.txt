She continued bathing for six weeks, and it was considered to have strengthened her; but as the pain in the knee still remained, she returned to London. Twelve months after the accident, the knee, from the constant irritation and pain, was very much contracted, and the leg drawn up towards the hip, particularly when in bed. To obviate this effect, the medical person who attended, di- rected that a spHnt fittt^d to the limb, should be laid close behind the knee every evening, so as to keep it straight. This expedient prevented the retraction of the leg certainly, but it brought on excessive pain, with screaming and watchfulness, which no opiates were capable of alleviating. â–  The parents submitted to the continuance of this application, till at length they were convinced that the child would die, worn out, if it was per- sisted in any longer. It was therefore, after some months, laid aside. During the time the splint was appHed, the knee was bathed every morning with warm water poured upon it, and afterwards wrapped for the day in a warm poultice of mashed turnip. She found the warmth of these applications af- forded a temporary relief, and that only. Subsequent to this, nothing was done, till she reached the age of ei^ht years. The painful state of the knee still continued very troublesome, but her general health and strength were good. About this time, however, the hip began to feel uneasy.

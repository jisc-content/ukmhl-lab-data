180 STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS tracting with force, the contents of the uretlira are driven forward with considerable impetus, the action of the muscular fibres of the canal coming forward with its contents, even to the orifice of the ure- thra. * These are the appearances and actions of health; but it is under circumstances of indisposition that .the strongest evidence is aftbrded of the membrane of the urethra possessing a muscular power. Indeed, the fact may be proved almost in any instance, by introducing a bougie of moderate size into the healthy urethra, and lightly supporting the * The infinite variety that may be obserred in the resources of nature is well calculated to excite our highest admiration. The spasm by which the membranous part of the urethra is closed up, in the venereal act, is obviously appointed to prevent the dispersion of the seminal fluid; the same end is obtained by a more ingenious and a more simple contrivance in some of the lower orders of the mammalia. In the male porpoise, for exam- ple, which I some time since dissected, the bladder communi- cates freely with the urethra, but the seminal ducts open upon the point of a soft spongy vascular papilla, that projects forward into the urethra, as the os uteri does into the vagina. Over the surface of this papilla, while in its flaccid state, a probe may readily be passed through the semilunar opening into the bladder; but just at this part the urethra is found to be encircled with a strong thread of ligamentous fibres, so that when, preparatory to the coitus, the parts are rendered turgid with blood, this vascular body swelling up, becomes so tightly girt by the ligamentous circle round its neck, as to effectually close up the passage into the bladder, and prevent the possibility of the dispersion of the fluid contents of the urethra.

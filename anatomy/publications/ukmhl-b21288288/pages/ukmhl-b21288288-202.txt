186 ON SOME OF THE ivas much larger in volume than natural, filling at least three-fourths of the whole cavity of the chest. The lungs, on each side, were universally adherent to the ribs and diaphragm. In some parts there were spaces between the adhesions, and these were filled with serum. On cutting through the peri- cardium, it was found closely connected to the heart; and the section being carried deeper, laid open the cavity of the ventricle. In every part of its surface the heart, which was enormously enlarged, was adherent to the pericardium, which membrane was so closely united with it, that it could scarcely be pulled away; nor was the bond of union between the two surfaces made out with- out difficulty, so small was the quantity of effused coagulable lymph. The internal organization of the heart was perfectly natural, but it was in this instance so much enlarged, as to exceed very con- siderably the ordinary ^ size of the largest adult heart. In the abdomen the structure of the liver was found healthy, but it had suffered inflammation, and was united above to the diaphragm, by numerous elongated adhesions. Involved in these adhesions were found several thin capsules <of yellowish co- lour, and full of serum. It seemed from the ap- pearance of these capsules, that when the effusion took place, the coagulable lymph separated from the thinner fluid, forming an exterior pellicle, or capsule, enclosing the serum within it. This re- markable appearance corresponded very closely with what I once had an opportunity of observing

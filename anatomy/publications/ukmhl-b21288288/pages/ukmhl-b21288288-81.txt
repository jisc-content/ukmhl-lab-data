AND ITS JVIEMBRANES. of paralysis, the case is more hopeless, than where the palsy has come on unaccompanied with that symptom. For where no pain ,has been felt in the head, or only a temporary sense of giddiness, the probability is that the paralytic affection may be the result of a mere effusion of blood upon the brain, an accident to which we occasionally find the brain able to acommodate itself, so that with the assistance of proper treatment, the functions of the nervous system are restored, and the patient more or less perfectly recovers. When however violent pains in the head have been the precursors of the attack, there is great reason to dread the existence of inflammation of the membranes of the brain, connecting itself with effusion either of se- rum, or pus, neither of which events, when depen- dant upon an internal cause, have ever yet been proved by subsequent dissection, to be compatible with the recovery of the patient. One of the most extraordinary instances of what even the brain will sometimes bear in the way of injury and pressure from effused blood, is said to have occurred in the late Mr. the most famous comedian of his day, who two years before his death had a fit of apoplexy, in consequence of which he partially lost the use of his left side, but in a few months recovered sufficiently to return to tho, stage, and to command the admiration of the au- dience, to as unlimited an extent as ever.

STOMACH AND INTESTINAL CANAL. able to keep down the morsel when swallowed. The natiu'al action of the oesophagus carried it well enough to the seat of the disease, but as it could not pass this point, it then produced an inverted action, and the food was returned. Latterly, the disease would not even allow the passage of fluids; when he became dependent for his existence upon the frequent injection of nutritious broths and â€¢ milk; by which means a miserable existence was prolonged for some few weeks. Examination. The whole extent of the oesophagus was re- moved, but no appearance of disease was found higher than the cardiac orifice of the stomach. At this part there was an irregular tumor, almost as large as a small orange. When this tumor was laid open, so as to expose the passage of the oeso- phagus into the stomach, and carefully examined, it appeared that the disease had taken place in the muscular coat of the oesophagus; for the mucous membrane, although somewhat inflamed, seemed in other respects sound; the external coat of cel- lular membrane also was apparently healthy. The feel of the disease was that of scirrhus; the cir- cumference was externally firm, and several tuber- cular projections formed towards the centre, were so compressed against each other, as to effectually glose up the passage into the stomach. No other diseased appearances were found.

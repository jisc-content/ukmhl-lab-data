G 3 OF ADHERENT CALCULUS* It does not appear that the texture of the calculus has any material influence either in promoting or retarding this process of adhesion ; for in the case just mentioned, it had taken place with a calculus, the surface of which was composed of the phosphates, and in another instance, which will be more parti- cularly spoken of with the cases, the medium of adhesion had very firmly united itself to a calculus of oxalate of lime. * The circumstance of a calculus being adherent to the coats of the bladder may in some instances be tolerably well ascertained, in the operation of sound- ing ; for the sensation conveyed by the instrument will be pretty clearly that of a calculus confined to a particular part of the cavity of the bladder, allow- ing the sound to strike against it, and pass by. In other cases however there is no intimation of this sort, at least none sufficiently clear to be at all de- pended upon, nor indeed, would it, if known, ma- terially interfere with the adoption of the means necessary for relief, although the adhesion of a cal- culus certainly lessens, in some degree, the proba- bility of a favourable issue to the operation for lithotomy. * See Case 12.

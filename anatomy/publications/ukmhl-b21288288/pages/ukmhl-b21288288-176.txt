160 ENLARGEMENT OF LYMPHATIC one instance known an experiment succeed ad- mirably. It was made with a view to restore arti- ficially, the deficient tone of the parts affected, and induce either a truly healthy action, or one as near to it as possible. It was in a young lady, about seventeen. There had been a tumor just below the angle of the jaw, as large as a pullet's egg. This had been long troublesome, and at last bursting, continued to discharge curdy and thin matter for several months. When this healed, another gland began to enlarge in the same way. The surgeon who attended, considering how tedious the progress of the former tumor had been, deter- mined to allow it in this instance to come, forward, and when it had come very near the skin, he punc- tured it, and afterwards injected the cavity with a solution of the sulphas zinci, in the proportion of seven or eight grains of the salt to an ounce of water. The effect of this operation was very mild; a moderate degree of healthy inflammation, with some tumor, heat, and redness, supervened, which terminated in adhesion ; and the experiment com- pletely succeeded, as there was no return of the complaint. I have seen several instances of very large ab- scesses taking place in some of the absorbent glands of the neck, attended with violent inflam- matory action; as the result of scarlet fever. These only require bringing forward, and it is astonishing how quickly, not only the cavity of the abscess, but all the surrounding tumor and induration, is absorbed and got rid of.

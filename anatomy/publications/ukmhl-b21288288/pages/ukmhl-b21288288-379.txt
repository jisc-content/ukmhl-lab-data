OF THE VAGINA. A A 4 freely, and was readily brought forward, so that its point could be obscurely felt through the pre- ternatural integuments. On inquiry it appeared, that the urine, and the menstrual discharges were regularly passed by this small external opening, and that when she was out of order, a swelling generally took place from the accumulation of contents in the vagina, which sometimes made its escape with difficulty. The operation consisted in passing a curved bistoury into the orifice below, bringing the point as high up forwards as possible, and then making the instrument cut its own way out. When laid open, the parts within the vagina were examined, and the structure was found in every respect perfects The haemorrhage was not very considerable. The divided parts were kept asun- der by some narrow slips of lint, and fomentations were directed for a few days, till suppuration was established, after which the parts were dressed every day with dry lint, and in the course of five weeks the wound was perfectly healed, an^ the parts left in their natural state. That the above state of parts was owing to an adhesion accidentally produced, there is every reason to believe, having since that time had an opportunity of tracing, in various instances, the several progressive steps which must eventually have led to precisely the same appearances.

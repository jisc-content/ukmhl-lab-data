us ON DISEASE IN THE as I am at present engaged in rather an extensive practical enquiry into the healthy organization and diseased appearances of the bones, the more par- ticular circumstances and minute appearances ob- serv^ed in the present case, will probably be reverted to, upon some future occasion.* The articulation of the ancle, considering its importance in sustaining the weight of the body, and the form of the joint itself, appears to be rather inadequately supported; and referring to observation, we see that in weak habits, where - the relaxed state of the muscles and ligaments add to the insecurity of the joint, the least inequality of ground is sometimes capable of oversetting the foot, the consequence of which accident is strain or laceration of the ligaments of the articulation, sometimes connected with fracture. The general observations that relate to affec- tions of the hip, will apply to injuries of the ancle joint. The situation of the part is un- favourable to its recovery from the effects of ex- ternal violence; but the greatest difficulty exists in the very nature of the parts injured. Liga- mentous parts in general enjoy a very small mea- sure of vitality, and consequently remain so long in a state of weakness, after having suffered in- jury, that it almost always happens that they are * Plate 6.

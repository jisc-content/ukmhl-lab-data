ON SOME OF THE 194 covered, but it was so much smaller and thinner than usual, tluit it was by no means easy to distin- guish the coats of the vessel from the continuous surface of the pericardium. On cutting open the ventricles, a probe was found to pass with perfect freedom from each of them, into the aorta. But although the extremity of the pulmonary artery was inserted upon the pro- per part of the basis of the heart, upon introducing a probe, it proved to be impervious, and had no opening from the ventricle. This fact was more clearly ascertained by laying open the artery, down ' to its termination in a small cul de sac, close against the membrane lining the cavity of the ventricle. On comparing the ventricles, the structure was apparently reversed. The parietes of the right ven- tricle had the strength and thickness natural to the left, while the left ventricle was as thin, and com- paratively weak, as the right usually is. The left auricle was so remarkably small as to confirm the opinion of its having had very little to do, in the circulation of the blood. A probe passed freely from the aorta, by the ductus arteriosus, into the branches of the pulmon- ary artery, in the lungs. In this way a stream of blood almost equal to the diameter of a crow quill, might perhaps have found its way by a retrograde course through the lungs, round to the left side of the heart.* * For the opportunity of examining the state of the heart in this and the former case, I am indebted to my friend Dr. S. Merriman, who requested me to examine the bodies; the pre* parations are in Mr. Heaviside's Museum.

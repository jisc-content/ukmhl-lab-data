ON HIP DISEASE. c c 2 -387 Case 104. Diseased tli^. Charles Robinson, aged fifty, was at sea in Janur arj I8O7, and in a very heavy gale of wind, received a severe bruise upon the projecting part of the trochanter. He was coming up through the hatch- way, with a basket full of corn for the poultry, when a heavy lurch of the ship threw him suddenly and with great force down to leeward, and he nar- / rowly escaped going overboard. By this accident his hip was struck violently against the corner of the iron heel of a spare topmast, which was upon deck. He felt lame and sore upon the hip, but rubbed the part with something from the medicine- chest, and continued at his duty for the rest of the voyage. He never thought himself well however, because he almost constantly experienced shooting or ach- ing pains about the seat of the injury, and even believed that they got worse by time. Nothing how- ever was done, and as long as eighteen months after- ward he engaged himself as captain's cook on board a store ship, for though still very pooriy and lame, he yet considered he was able to do something. In a few weeks after going to sea, he got worse^ and became so exceeding lame and ill, that he was confined to his hammock. He complained of fe- verish heat and thirst, and his appetite failed him entirely; although there was only the violence of the internal pain to explain his illness, for on the part nothing amiss could be seen.

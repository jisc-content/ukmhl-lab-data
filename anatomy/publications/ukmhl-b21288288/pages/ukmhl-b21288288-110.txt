ON THE AFFECTIONS better ; but on a sudden her eyes closed, her limbs became rigid, and she was repeatedly shaken by a convulsion, decidedly more violent than ever. Her body was for some moments raised up from the bed by the violence of the fit. At this time her pulse was 72, and small. The convulsion sub- siding, she came to herself, and being questioned, said she had still the same loud noise in her ears, and the same extreme sensibility to light as before. In half an hour she was much better, spoke quite ration- ally, and said the pain in her head was very much relieved. Previous to the bleeding, this pain had been of a constant, dull, heavy, and oppressive kind, but it now assumed another character, being sharp, and transitory, darting occasionally, and quickly, through the brain. The most important circumstance, however, in which she expressed herself relieved, was that in her mind and judgment, she felt more free, and more clear, than before. There was no heat about the skin, nor the least thirst. She took the saline mixture frequently, with ten drops of the tincture of opium in each dose. On Monday morning, January 16, there was occasional tendency to light delirium ; she said she " had now no pain in her head, nor the least noise in her ears, but was in every respect quite easy, and comfortable. The pulse had risen to 84. The saline medicines were continued, as before. In the afternoon she was perfectly sensible j but precisely at the same hour as on the preceding day, she was affected with a return of slight spasms.

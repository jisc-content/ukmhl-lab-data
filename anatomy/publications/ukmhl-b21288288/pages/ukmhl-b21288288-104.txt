ON THE AFFECTIONS 88 very considerable tumor was found pressing the membrane in upon the cavity of the skull. The dura mater at this part had not lost its natural texture, but exhibited a great number of fine ar- terial branches, ramifying over its internal surface ; this appearance, however, did not resemble that of inflammation, but a chronic increase of vascu- larity. The inferior and external part of the lefl anterior lobe cerebri, was found to have been progressively removed by absorption, from the increasing pressure of the tumor upon its surface; and it is worthy of remark, that although a quaiuity equal to three or four ounces of the substance of the brain was thus taken away, the cortical structure of the cerebrum, the pia mater, with every appearance necessary to the peculiar circulation through this organ, remained entire, only it formed at this part a concave instead of a convex surface. The only structure, therefore, which had suffered from the pressure, was the me- dullary substance; and it is very curious, that the perfect state of intellect that was preserved during the whole progress of the complaint, warrants the opinion that the functions of the brain were scarcely, if at all, impaired. An extensive section, passing through the bones of the face and basis of the cranium, so as to in- clude the whole of the disease, was next removed with the saw, so as to allow of the whole being im- mersed in alcohol, that the contents of the tumors might be rendered sufficiently firm to admit of a more satisfactory examination.

163 GLANDS or THE NECK. Case 44. Large Tumor in the Neck, from the Use of Mercury, Another very remarkable instance of chronic af- fection of these glands, apparently derived from the long use of mercury, occurred in the case of a young man, also a venereal patient. For the last five years he had rarely been free from the mercu- rial excitement, either as required by the recurrence of old symptoms, or the application of new in- > fection. In October 1813, (about two months after lie had finished the last course he had then gone through,) a swelling began to form in the right side of his neck. This was so far from giving pain, that another person first pointed it out to him, by observing that the one side of his neck was cer- tainly larger than the other. He paid no attention to it till December, when it had become very conspicuous. It then appeared to be an extensive soft fulness on that side of the neck, extending from below the ear^ down nearly to the sternum. The only application (out of many) which he found diminish the swelling at all, was a cold lotion, formed of a strong solution of the muriate of am- monia; but notwithstanding this, the swelling eventually continued to increase. In July 1814 he found evident signs of vene- real infection upon him, and on that account ob- tained admission into the St. George's Infirmary,

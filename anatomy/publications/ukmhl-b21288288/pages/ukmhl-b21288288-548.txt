6 CALCULOUS AFFECTIONS sited in the urine may have very much the appear- ance of a white sand, principally composed of the am- moniaco magnesian phosphate, although frequently containing variable proportions of phosphate of lime. The phosphates, however, are occasionally voided in solution, in which case instead of their being found immediately the urine is passed, they never make their appearance until that fluid has remained at rest for some hours, when a fine pellicle, or crystal- line lamella?, may be observed to form upon the surface. Calculi formed in the cavities of the kidney are almost always composed of uric acid, and they will sometimes increase in this situation, to a consider- able size * ; but where from accidental circum- stances, such as exercise, bodily exertion, or the like, a small stone has made its escape from the kid- ney, and has passed down into the bladder, the urine is generally for some time afterward unusually loaded with uric acid, and deposits that substance now in the bladder. When this period however has passed over, the subsequent addition to the calculus con- sists principally of the phosphates. In some few instances small kidney calculi, com- posed of oxalate of lime, have been voided, but such occurrences are rare. See Calculus, Platjs I. Fig. i. 5

250 ON SOME ArFECTIONÂ« Case 74. Diseased Liver, filed 'with Hydatids* John Mackie, aged fifty-three years, died March 9, 1800. He was by trade a cabinet-maker, and had always enjoyed very good healtli, till about nine years before his death, when he one morning complained of a pain which he compared to some- thing having separated, and dropt from his right side. This occurred in rising from bed, and after it he became subject to a pain in the part. Very frequently, and at various hours of the day or night, he w^as seized with violent shiverings, but more particularly after using exercise. Occasionally he was so costive, as to have no motion for ten, twelve, or even fourteen days. His stools were at all times excessively offen- sive. He was subject to nausea, and vomiting, dis- charging however, only small quantities of green- ish or yellow matter. About two years subsequent to his becoming poorly, he had twice or thrice vomited something, which in smell and appearance very exactly resembled faeces. Throughout his illness, he was extremely sub- ject to flatulence, continually discharging wind by the mouth. Whenever this complaint was parti- cularly distressing, his appetite was much greater, than at other times. * The minutes of the following case, with the disease, ave preserved in Mr. Heaviside's Museum.

^^Qq. ON AFFECTIONS OF the swelling had given way. The quantity of dis- charge was at least equal to several quarts, and it appeared very doubtful whether he could survive the first effedts of so tremendous a crisis. Eor the space of three weeks after this event, the putrid contents of the aneurismal cavity con- tinued to come away in such quantity that it was found necessary to change his bed-Hnen every day. In the course of this period several new openings formed in the integuments, while the creneral parietes of the tumor became thinner and more flaccid from the frequent evacuation of large masses of grumous blood and lymph. By the end of the third week a quantity of sloughy membranous matter made its appearance at the largest opening, and this with care was by degrees separated and brought, away, and proved to .be a very large mass of thickened, sloughy, and putrid, cellular membranfe. The removal of this substance was productive of so much irritation and exhaustion, that notwith- standino- every assistance, it was scarcely expected that he''could Hve through the night; from that time, however, he began to mend. On the evacuation of the contents of this im- mense tumor, the principal object, of course, was to support his strength, so as to enable him, it possible, to bear up against so great a discharge of putrid matter. With this view warm jelhes, soups, wine, &c. were exhibited in small quantities every half hour, with the most unremittmg at- tention.

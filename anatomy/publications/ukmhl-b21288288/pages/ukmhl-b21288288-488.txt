ON DISLOCATION 466 In November 1812, she again had the misfor- tune to dislocate the same joint, by falling down in a fit. On examination the head of the humerus dislocated backwards projected behind the glenoids cavity. She was totally unable to produce any motion in the shoulder, but complained of great pain, in and about the joint. She said her health had so declined, that she had entirely lost her little remaining strength, which, however, under her present circumstances was so far favourable as that it enabled me to reduce the head of the bone without assistance, or difficulty. But as it still required some force to press it back from behind the margin of the glenoide cavity, there is no doubt that had the patient been a strong, fat, and muscular person, the reduction would have proved either extremely difficult, or altogether im- practicable. Where the partially dislocated shoulder remains unreduced, that part of the head of the humerus lying against the margin of the glenoide cavity, is exposed to the whole of that pressure, which in the natural situation of the bone, is supported by the more extended surface of the articular cavity; whifeh pressure is in every case proportioned to the tone or power of the muscles connected with the joint. The consequence of this increased pressure is absorption, first of the carriage, then of the bone, along the line of contact; but as the head

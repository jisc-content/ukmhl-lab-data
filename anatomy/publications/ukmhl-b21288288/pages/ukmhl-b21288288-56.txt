40 AFFECTIONS OF PARTS HO opinion at all could be given till the child was twenty years old. In May, 1814, I performed the first operation. The septum narium, where it was connected with the projected'piece of bone, had become firmly os- sified, and possessed a thickness and strength quite unusual in its natural state*. The central slip of integument was first dissected carefully back. A fine steel saw, with a narrow well-tempered blade, was then applied above at the root of the projecting portion of jaw, and the bone was sawn through per- pendicularly. The saw cut extremely well, and worked freely, but the texture of the bone was much more compact than might have been expected. A medullary artery of the bone threw forth a very free jet of blood for some time, but it spontaneously ceased on exposure to the air. It appeared rather desirable that the posterior part of the central slip should, if possible, be made to unite with the divided surface of the bone. With this intention, the parts were carefully brought together, and retained by narrow transverse slips of * Plate 2. Fig. 2.

The projecting portion of the jaw, covered with an inte- gument similar to the lining of the roof of the mouth. h. The two incisor teeth. c. The margin of the fissure towards the left side of the lip, continuous with the nostril of the same side. d. A part of the corresponding line upon the right side of the lip. e. The central slip of integument, that, upon the removal of the projecting piece of jaw a, became pendulous, so as to occupy the space between c and d.

EXPLANATION OF THE PLATEs,. , The sui-face of the mucous membrane Umng the cavity of the bladder, exhibiting the appearance ot numerous small spots of extravasated blood, pro- duced by the friction of the stone producmg abra- sion of the capillary arteries distributed upon the membrane. This appearance demonstrates the principle upon which the urine is in these cases so frequently tinged with blood, shewing that it arises merely from the mechanical injury to the membrane Hning the bladder. ' Fig. 4. Exhibits the section of the calculus seen in the last figure. a The nucleus of the stone, consisting of uric acid. i A thin stratum which from its open and loose tex- ture and light grey colour is evidently composed of mucous matter and the phosphates only. From the size of the concrete round which this first de- posit of the phosphates has taken place, it appears ,, very probable that upon the passage of the uric nucleus from the kidney into the bladder, the se- cretion of an excess of uric acid had for a time been suspended, a change to be perhaps explamed by the escape of the calculus having allowed the irritation within the kidney to subside to a certain degi-ee, although the nature of the subsequent ad- dition proves that this action was very soon re-as- sumed. e. The more external parts of the stone composed of the phosphates with variable proportions of mucous matter.

PRODUCTION OF FALSE PASSAGES. 157 physician who for many years was one of the most approved teachers in London in his particular depart- ment of medical science. He had been for manyyears subject to strictures in the urethra, and had been long in the habit of passing bougies for himself. In con- sequence of this practice he had formed two false passages; one of these was anterior to the veru- montanum, and passed obHquely out from the ure- thra for the extent of l-4th of an inch, forming a cul de sac; the other was situated higher up, passing between the substance of the prostate gland and .the inner membrane lining the canal, to the extent of 5-8ths of an inch, where it again opened into the cavity of the bladder. * In those instances in which the urgency of the case has required an immediate evacuation of the contents of the bladder, while the degree of enlarge- ment of the prostate gland has been so considerable as to prevent the possibihty of getting the silver catheter introduced by gentle means, it has some- times been considered expedient to endeavour to overcome the obstruction by force. Upon this prin- ciple the substance of the enlarged gland has in some few cases been made to give way, the instru- ment has got into the bladder, and a practicable passage has remained for the future introduction of the catheter, without the patient appearing to suffer * See Plate 3.

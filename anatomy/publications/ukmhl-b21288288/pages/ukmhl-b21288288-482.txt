460 ON DISEASE IN THE BONES OF THE LIMB. About nine months subsequent to the accident, the limb was removed by amputation, and the pa- tient then recovered very well On dissection of the limb, the sinuses upon the leg were found to be connected with a purulent ca- vity within the bone, just above the ancle joint. Subsequent to maceration, the real state of the bones became much more distinct. Within a cavity, situated between the tibia and the astragalus, was a large piece of necrosed bone, entirely separated from the surrounding parts' and, on its anterior surface covered with cartilao-e. This piece of bone, from the figure of its articular surface, was apparently a part of the head of the as- tragalus, which had most probably been fractured by the fall.* Sect. 2. ON DISLOCATION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. With regard to dislocation, there has been great diversity of opinion upon several points of the most * Plate VI. Fig. 4<. Exhibits the appearance of the bones, on a reduced scale, subsequent to maceration. a. The spine of the tibia. b. The fibula. c. The anterior articulating surface of the astragalus. d. The mass of ossific matter, by which anchylosis has been effected towards the outer ancle. c. The epiphysis of the fibula, enlarged from inflamma- tion; in consequence of which the line of junction between the epiphysis and the body of the bone is made apparent by a partial separation. j: The ossific matter effused upon the inner ancle, firmly connecting the tibia and astragalus together. g. The cartilaginous surface of the detached jiortion of . bone.

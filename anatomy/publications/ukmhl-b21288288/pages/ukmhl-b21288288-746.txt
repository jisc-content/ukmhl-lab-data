The most likely me^ns for enabling us to avoid this difficulty is suggested by what we learn from the morbid anatomy of the parts. We find almost invariably that when a false passage is produced in any part beyond the curvature of the urethra, it is on the posterior side of the canal, and consequently if the instrument passed has sufficient firmness to admit of its point being pressed against the opposite or anterior part of the urethra in its way on to the bladder, it may slip past the opening that leads out of the urethra, and by this means be enabled to reach its destination in safety.

28 DISTENSION OF THE KIDNEY. ureter, by a calculus having been arrested in pass- ing from the kidney down into the bladder. It is extremely curious to observe how large a quantity of fluid, and how complete a change in its internal structure, the kidney will admit under these cir- cumstances, without altogether discontinuing its functions, or entirely laying aside the farther secre- tion of urine. * In the advanced stages of calculous affections of the kidney, this state of parts is not unfrequently met with, and must be regarded as being principally concerned in shortening life, by the constant and fatiguing pain, and the excessive irritation incident to this particular affection of kidney. The only medical assistance perhaps, that can be proposed in this distressing exigency, presents itself in the full exhibition of anodynes and opiates, which will generally do all that can be done for the relief of the patient; but under their most favourable operation, little more can be expected than a tem- porary alleviation of symptoms, although it is asto- nishing what the constitutional powers may be occasionally made to effect on the behalf of the â€¢patient, when they are properly assisted. * See Kidney, Plate i.

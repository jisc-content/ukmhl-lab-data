This same symptom I have known produced in one instance, by a very curious and very uncom- mon affection of the inner membrane of the blad- der, in consequence of which that membrane had formed a transverse valvular fold across the neck of the bladder, opposite to the orifice of the urethra* This complaint, as it increased created frequent difficulty in passing the water, and the patient at last died of retention of urine. * One of the least faUible signs of stone in the bladder, is the extreme increase of pain and irritation at the neck of the bladder that occurs in the act of expelhng the last drops of urine, although I have myself found this symptom constantly present in. an irritation which proved eventually to have existed quite independent of stone. The symptom of all others least liable to deceive, appears to be a peculiar effect of the irritation; it is the distressing sense of burning heat, and in- tolerable itching, that is felt either in or about the external orifice of the urethra; but even this symptom, which may be considered the most cer- tain of any, will occur only when the stone is press- . — r,'»' * The preparation of the disease is preserved in Mr. Heavi* side's Museum.

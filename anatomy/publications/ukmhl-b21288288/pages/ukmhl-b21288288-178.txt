162 ENLARGEMENT OF LYMPHATIC margin, of the jaw on the left side of the face. These were in a partially indolent state, surrounded by an extensively indurated mass, from a consider- able effusion of coagulable lymph having taken place into the adjacent cellular texture; yet each of these glands evidently contained matter. The character of the afiection was inflammation, decidedly more acute and painful than the truly scrofulous, with at least as much disposition to affect many glands at once, as scrofula has. Her general health was good, but she complained much of the tenderness, and constant pain, which pre- vented her rest at night. The general treatment had been poultice and fomentation, which materially forwarded the break- ino; of the abscesses, several of which had reached the size of a hen's egg, before they burst. Cold sea water was tried for three weeks, without its ap- pearing to do any thing. On the 24th of April, she mentioned a swelling in the axilla, on the right side, which was, on ex- amination, found to be one of the absorbent glands enlarged to the size of a goose egg. It felt soft and pulpy, was painless and insensible. This was left to itself, and very slowly dispersed. After six months' interval, another abscess formed with less pain than had formerly attended, in one of the glands of the neck. A considerable thickening and induration of the parts still remained from the old affection.

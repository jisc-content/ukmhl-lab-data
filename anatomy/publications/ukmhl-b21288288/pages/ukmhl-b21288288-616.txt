The elastic gum-catheter has another advantage. It occasionally happens that a person who has long suffered under the fatigue of perpetual pain and irritation, and perhaps has had repeated and unsuc- cessful attempts made to find the stone by sound- ing, is so struck with the very idea of the torment he expects again to go through by a repetition of the experiment, that he cannot possibly bring his mind to submit to the proposed trial, whereas if his feelings are not alarmed, if he is merely requested to allow the state of the urethra to be examined by the introduction of a hollow bougie into the blad- der, he suffers nothing in apprehension, and scarcely any thing in reality.

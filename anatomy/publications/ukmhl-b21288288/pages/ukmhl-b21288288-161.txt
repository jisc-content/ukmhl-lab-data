OF THE LARYNX. 145 sils were found inflamed. A small slough had nearly separated from the right tonsil. But the opening into the larynx seemed also inflamed, and almost choaked up with mucus. The larynx and trachea were therefore removed and laid open, when the whole extent of the membranous hning was found highly inflamed. Upon the internal surface of the membrane lining the trachea, and very loosely connected with it, was deposited a considerable quantity of coagulable lymph. This was of a yellow colour, and pulpy consistence, which circumstances might have in some degree depended on its being min- gled with a profuse secretion of viscid mucous matter. The coagulable lymph formed an irregu- lar tube within the trachea, while the mucous matter, partly of a purulent colour, and partly clear and transparent, occupied the space within the adventitious lining. The mucous membrane itself, when exposed, was found of the brightest scarlet colour, from high inflammation. These appearances extended themselves very far down beyond the bifurcation of the trachea; and even in the smaller branches which the puru- lent action seemed scarcely to have reached, there was an unusually abundant secretion of mucus, the consistence of which was so viscid and tena- cious, that it must have materially hastened the fatal termination of the disease, by preventing the passage of the air, and eventually producing suf- focation.

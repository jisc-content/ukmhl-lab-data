OF THE KIDNEY. ' B 4 We see then that the formation of a red sand, or a white crystalline matter, or a consolidation of these substances into a single mass or stone, con- stitute the appearances most usually met with in the urine, where a disposition to secrete calculous matter exists in the kidney; but I have in one instance found a kidney loaded with a very sin- gular kind of matter. It occurred in the examina- tion of the body of a person who never had com- plained of any affection of the urinary organs. By mere accident the kidneys were examined, and that upon the right side was perfectly healthy ; the left however was much enlarged, and felt as if crammed with a stiff pulpy matter. On removal from the body it was remarkably heavy, and weighed more than a pound and a half Upon cutting into it, the pelvis and infundibula were found full of a compact earthy substance, in consistence re- sembling birdlime, of a pale yellowish grey colour*. The secretion of this curious substance had in all probability been going on for a considerable length of time, as the cavities of the kidney were much enlarged from pressure, the result of which had been the removal of most of the solid structure of the a-land. The renal arterv and vein were readily * By analysis Mr. Brande found this matter to consist of car- bonate of lime, mingled with an extremely tenacious animal matter. He observed that it was the first instance he had ever known of the kidney secreting carbonate of lime.

226 ON SOME AFFECTIONS thickened, in many parts to fth of an inch. In structure it much resembled the appearance of the sac of an old hernia, or diseased tunica vaginalis testis ; but had a portion of it been seen, removed from the body, no one could have supposed it peritoneum. Independent of the thickening of the peritoneum, the whole of its surface was studded with tubercles of various sizes. Some of these were large as grapes, but most of them much smaller. The structure of these tubercles was the same every where, and somewhat resem- bled the texture of the yolk of a hard boiled egg, although of a lighter colour. When cut into, the consistence and appearance was perfectly equal and similar every where, not having any specific organization. Dividing through the peritoneum, as well as the tubercle, clearly confirmed the opi- nion suggested by their external appearance ; for they were then very evidently situated upon the surface of the membrane, and not formed between its laminiB, as might have been at first expected. Turning the attention to the confused mass of viscera, the intestines were, after much dissection, found lying mostly near the surface of an exten- sive heavy mass of softish disease, somewhat move- able, upon the spine. This seemed to imply the mesentery being its principal seat. I endeavoured to separate the lateral parietes from the contents of the abdomen, intending by this means to turn the whole outj but the adhesion was so firmly estabhshed, that the only possible mode of doing this'was, by cutting through the diseased perito^

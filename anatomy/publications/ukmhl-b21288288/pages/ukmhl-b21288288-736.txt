194 CONSEQ.UENCES OF STRICTURE. bladder, is productive of irritation, distension, and inflammation in that part of the urethra between the bladder and the stricture ; and the inflamma- tion so excited frequently proceeds to a consider- able extent, spreading itself into the surrounding parts. It is by this means, when unassisted, that nature seeks to relieve herself by the formation of a new passage for the urine, and this effort generally suc- ceeds to a certain extent, inasmuch as it averts the danger which otherwise would in a few days prove fatal; although in its subsequent consequences the remedy proves sometimes almost as formidable as the disease. The mode in which these changes are brought about is the following. The frequently repeated and almost unavailing exertions of the bladder to get rid of its contents, keeps up a constant pres- sure of m'ine against the sides of the urethra be- hind the stricture, in consequence of which this part of the canal suffers a gradual enlargement; but the same cause continuing to operate, the effect does not stop here ; irritation supervenes, and this imperceptibly runs on to inflammation, frequently followed by a considerable effusion of coagulable lymph upon the surface of the inner membrane. Ulceration of some part of the inflamed surface subsequently takes place, and the urine makes its way out into the cellular membrane around the

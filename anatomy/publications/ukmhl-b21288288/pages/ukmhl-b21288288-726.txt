Of the Circumstances which favour the Conversion of Spasmodic, into Permanent Stricture. While the stricture remains in this state, it is liable to occasional contraction or relaxation, from the influence of apparently trifling accidental cir- cumstances. It necessarily becomes the most irritable part of the canal, and any change in diet, excess in wine, exercise, or fatigue, may be suf- ficient to aggravate the degree of spasm, excite inflammation, and even bring on a complete re- tention of urine; and the usual consequence of such accident is, that the stricture, which was at first merely a spasmodic affection, becomes converted by degrees into a permanent contraction of the part, from the change in structure incident to re- peated inflammation. Sect. 4. On the Irritations that occasionally operate as Causes. of Stricture. As stricture in the urethra is ahnost always in the first instance the consequence of some irritation, it is natural to infer that the nature and tendency

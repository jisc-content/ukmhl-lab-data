Here then we see a very principal cause of in- security, with regard to future health; for sup- posing the suppuration declines, and that the sinus as well as the abscess, heals up as at first, still the parts are sure of being left in a more unsound state than before. Under these circumstances there will be increased difficulty in preventing future for- mations of matter, dependant perhaps, at a very distant date, upon the most trivial accident, the least cold, or the slightest bruise, or over fatigue, neither of which circumstances, had there been no weak point in the constitutional powers, would have excited any attention, or brought on any unplea- sant consequence. In the first of the three following cases the cavity of the hip joint was diseased, although from the progress of the disease, as well as from the ap- pearance upon dissection, it was most probably not the seat of the primary aflection j in the second

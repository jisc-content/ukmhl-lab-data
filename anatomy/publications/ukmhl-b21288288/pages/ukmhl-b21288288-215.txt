AFFECTIONS OF THE LUNGS. 199 prevented by proper treatment. Where weakness is the prevaiHng character, the inflammatory stage runs a very uncertain and tedious course, its cha- racters are extremely ambiguous, and the treatment that would decidedly check healthy inflammation of the lungs, generally fails in relieving this form of the complaint. Inflammatory action in the lungs, as in other parts of the body, varies in intensity, and as it becomes less acute, or more local, its characters change, and that which was originally a general affection of the lungs, may become new modelled, assuming the characters of a local affection only, per- haps without pain, or other constitutional sympathy. Dr. CuUen mentions an effusion of blood into the general cellular texture of the lungs, as one of the occasional consequences of acute inflamma- tion. I have examined the lungs after death in many cases of inflammation, but have never found this appearance. In one instance only I have seen it, and that was entirely unconnected with inflam- mation. It was in a child who died at about four years old, of hooping-cough. I had expected, from the oppression, and other previous symptoms, to have found the trachea stuffed with mucous matter j but it proved otherwise, for the passages of the trachea, and bronchiee, were very free.

63 STONE IN THE BLADDER. a man who never in his life had sufFered from any of the symptoms of stone, and the evidently quiet state, and pale complexion of the mucous mem- brane when the bladder was removed afforded a strong confirmation of the fact, as it demonstrably proved that there was not the least degree of excite- ment or irritation upon the bladder at the time of the patient's death. Sect. 5. Of Irritationfrom Sympathy with surrounding Paris. Another occasional cause of irritation in the bladder, is the sympathetic connection existing be- tween this viscus and the surrounding parts. Any irritation or other affection about the uterus or rectum, will give rise to uneasy sensations in the urinary bladder; and according to the nature or continued operation of the cause, the sympathetic irritation will be either a transient affection or a more tedious source of distress. The irritation produced by worms in the intes- tines, when they are situated low down in the rectum, will excite a degree of tenesmus, connect- ing itself with frequency and uneasiness in passing the water; and I have in repeated instances had the same thing occur temporarily, from the irrita- tion incident to my having removed hgemorrhoidal excrescences by ligature.

ON SOME AFFECTIONS present disease, it seems to me most probable, that the tubercular appearances upon the peritoneum were the result of the prompt coagulation of the efliised lymph. For where the surfaces of the in- testines were seen, the same process and the same appearances were observed. Some time after the above dissection was made, a circumstance transpired, which may perhaps tend, at least in some measure, to explain the singular ap- pearances of the disease. It was ascertained that the unhappy youth had been drawn into bad company, and had at length, in all probability, fallen a victim to depraved and unnatural practices. â€¢ Inflammation of the peritoneum is a frequent occurrence, and, in almost every case, a very seri- ous one. Affections of this nature sometimes run on very quickly to purulent effusion ; and when this happens, I believe, there are exceeding few, if any, well authenticated instances of recovery. Should the inflammation, however, fall rather short of the above effect, so as to connect itself with the pouring out of coagulable lymph only, even in this case, the event must be extremely precarious, particularly when the effusion has taken place, to any extensive degree. I have, in several instances, examined bodies af- ter death, where, from the preceding history, it appeared, that the patient had died, worn out by a species of irritative fever only, rather than by con- tinuing symptoms of active inflammation, in cases of effusion of purulent matter, or of coagulable

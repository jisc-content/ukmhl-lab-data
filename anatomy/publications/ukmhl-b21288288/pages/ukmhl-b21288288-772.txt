In January 1816, he was again taken into the Infirmary, where he remained for several weeks en- tirely helpless from the gouty affection of his joints. The stricture however, remained much the same. This case affords an interesting illustration of the circumstances under which spasmodic stricture fre- (Juently commences, and of the symptoms that ge- nerally usher in the change from a spasmodic to a permanent state of contraction, in the urethra. While the affection was pure spasm no mechanical force could be made to overcome the contraction, although it might with certainty be removed by the exhibition of diaphoretic and antispasmodic reme- dies ; but as the state of the stricture changed, the same medicines, which at first never failed, operated with diminished power, and eventually lost their ef- fect altogether.

The following day, he said the pain was much better, and that his respiration was very free. He was therefore directed to continue the medicines that had relieved him, and put his feet into warm water at night. During the evening, however, his breathing became suddenly worse, and his complaint now rapidly increased. He said he had no pain, but an extreme oppression, and sense of suffocation about the breast. At a late hour in the evening, he had entirely lost the power of speaking.

The respi- ration was noisy, and laborious beyond description.

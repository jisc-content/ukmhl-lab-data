ON THE AFFECTIONS OF THE LARYNX. joint action of the surrounding auxiliary muscles of these organs. Again, in swallowing, a very complicated series of actions is necessary, in which the muscles of the larynx, which bring down the epiglottis, bear a part. Hence it is evident, that a very small degree of derangement may, in parts so constituted, produce much mischief; whether such derangement affects the structure, or the actions only. The most trifling irritation about any part of the larynx will occasionally induce a convulsive action, not only of the muscles of the larynx, but of the chest also ; and any irritation situated at the lower part of the trachea will, on the same principle, extend its operation, by exciting an irritation in the mus- cular parts of the larynx, so as to induce violent spasm, and symptoms more or less resembling asthma. An inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the cavity of the trachea has been called croup, and from a certain peculiarity in the sound of the voice being considered a constant attendant, this symptom has been very generally pointed out, as the diagnostic sign of the disease. The incon- stancy of symptoms, however, is such that it may be almost doubted whether there really are any symptoms that can be absolutely relied upon to point out the existence of particular internal disease. I have seen a case of croup in which this symptom was wanting, and on this very account the true nature of the affection was not suspected till it was too late. I have attended in another, where

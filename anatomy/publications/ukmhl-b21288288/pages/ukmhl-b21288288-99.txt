OF THE BRAIN. 83 it ran off; and it was afterwards measured. The quantity amounted to three full pints and an half. In proportion as the fluid was evacuated, the lateral parts, or parietes of the hemispheres collapsed, as- suming the appearance of a large medullary cyst. When the whole quantity of the fluid was poured away, the cerebrum and cerebellum were carefully taken out, without experiencing any accident or injury. The form and state of the brain had suffered so complete a change, that an accurate examination was almost impracticable, until it was immersed in proof spirit j by which means the whole of the large vaulted cavity was displayed, the sides being raised and supported by light hoops within, from which numerous silk threads, passing out through the substance of the brain, suspended the pre- paration. The appearance first seen upon the brain, re-, sembling so much the coat of an hydatid, proved to be the extenuated substance, and was all that re- mained of the corpus callosum. The characters still remaining upon various parts of the internal surface of this great cyst, proved evidentl}^ that the accumulation of serum which first commenced in the natural cavities of the lateral ventricles, had by degrees made its way into the third and fourth ventricles ; which cavities had been subjected to a slow change in their figure and other circum- stances, as well as those parts which had primarily suffered from distention. The ultimate result of this process was, that the G 2

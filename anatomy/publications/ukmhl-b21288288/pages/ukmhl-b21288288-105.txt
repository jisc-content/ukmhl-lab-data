OF THE BRAIN. 89 In the course of a week they were much con- tracted in size, and so far consolidated as to render it practicable to complete the inquiry. The large tumor upon the temporal bone was divided hori- zontally, and was found filled with a pulpy matter, more resembling coagulated blood than any other' substance. The tumor within the upper eye-Hd was the most prominent of the two that were upon the face, and it was, therefore, cut through trans- versely, and the upper portion being raised, ex- liibited very perfectly the structure of the disease. It appeared that the whole substance of the tumor was made up of alternate concentric laminje of coagulated blood, and a paler substance, which seemed to be an albuminous secretion. The layers were disposed so evenly, that they could only be considered as the consequence of some peculiar secretion, but whether from the capillary arteries in that part of the pericranium lining the bones within the orbit, or from any other structure, it was impossible to determine. The increase of the tumor within the socket of the eye, had produced absorption of the floor of the orbit, so that the maxillary antrum had become filled with a part of the diseased mass, and the same process of absorption, had the patient lived, would very soon have brought the tumor down through the antrum into the mouth. I have already stated the. influence of cer- tain affections of the mind, upon the circulation through the brain. Both the exciting and de- pressing passions are capable of disturbing the

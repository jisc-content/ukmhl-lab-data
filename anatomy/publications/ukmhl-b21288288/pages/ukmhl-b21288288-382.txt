ON THE AFFECTIONS 362 turn, and another by the meatus urinarius, (which was of so uncommon a size, as to admit of it with little or no distention,) nothing was found to in- tervene but the proper coats of each, connected by the cellular membrane. The uncommon dilata- tion of the urethra was attributed to her mother's forcibly introducing her finger, as she imagined, into the vagina, when she laboured under a violent paroxysm ; the outer extremity of the meatus was jagged, turgid, and bled freely, from the smallest violence consequent to introducing the finger. When the finger was in the anus, the uterus was plainly felt, and seemed as if by some cause pushed low down. In size, it was considerably enlarged, equal to a pregnant uterus far advanced; it might easily, during the pains, be felt as high as the navel, where, as well as from within the rectum, its ves- sels felt very turgid, and as if disposed to burst. After many fruitless attempts to discover the os tincse, it was evident it was no-where to be found. In this emergency, an immediate puncture into the uterus was judged expedient. Accordingly, the external parts being held aside by an assistant, a finger was introduced into the rectum, and a trocar was then cautiously directed, so as to wound neither rectum nor urethra, into the uterus, and immediately discharged nearly two pounds of men- strual blood, after which the orifice was considei^ ably enlarged, and a large armed tent mtroduced into the new passage to the uterus. From the time of the operation, which was per- formed on November 30, she continued gradually

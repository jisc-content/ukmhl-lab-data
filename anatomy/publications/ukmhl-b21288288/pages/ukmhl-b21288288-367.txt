347 ON OVARIAN DROPSY. among the intestines, were innumerable masses of the same gelatinous substance that had appeared in the operation during the life of the patient. These fragments were readily traced downwards to more connected masses which were attached to the source of the disease in the ovarium, wliere the accumulation of this peculiar secretion had in several of the cysts taken place with so much rapidity, as to have produced a partial absorption and subsequent rupture of the peritoneal covering of the ovarium, with the consequent escape of a large ^quantity of the gelatinous contents into the cavity of the abdomen, exciting extensive perito- neal inflammation. On removing the ovarium, and cutting into its various parts, the contents of all the cysts were found to be precisely the same. The general state of a diseased ovarium is, that one cyst shall contain a thin, clear, serous fluid, another a thick, albuminous matter, a third, a brown, thick, opake fluid, and so on ; but in the present instance, although the disease was evidently in different stages of its progress, in different parts of the ovarium, as proved by the difference in the size of the various cysts, the contained matter notwith- standing, was the sante in all of them. The following is another of those cases that I have attended of diseased ovarium, which, from several circumstances connected with it, seems de- serving of notice.

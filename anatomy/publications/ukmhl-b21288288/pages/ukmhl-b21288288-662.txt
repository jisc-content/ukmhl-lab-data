120 IRRITATION, kc, pletely converted into a cancerous structure; al- though it was impossible, by the external appearance, to determine what proportion of the general mass of the disease^was formed by the intestine. The whole was dissected out from the pelvis, and the anterior line of the intestine then laid open from the anus upwards, through the contracted pait, by which means the stricture was brought fairly into view. It appeared that the contraction had commenced about five inches above the anus, and had extended itself upwards and downwards, until at length a passage jthrough the strictured part became impracticable. The disease, from the villous coat to the external margin of the section, measured three-fourths of an inch in thickness. The cancerous disease by which the intestine was surrounded was firm as cartilage; in struc- ture this disease exactly resembled that of the pylorus. The urinary bladder exhibited the consequence of long continued and violent irritation from sym- pathy. Its structure was undiseased, but it was exceedingly contracted, and consequently much thickened in its coats. The cavity was scarcely capable of containing a table-spoonful of fluid. The inner membrane was astonishingly vascular, and of the brightest scarlet colour. * * See Bladder, Plate 2. Fig. 2.

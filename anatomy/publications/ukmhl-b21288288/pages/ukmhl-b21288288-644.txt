PRESENT METHODS 102 Many fanciful contrivances have been suggested for breaking up and crushing a stone in the bladder, where it is too large to admit of extraction, but these instruments although some of them are inge- niously contrived, have scarcely ever been found applicable in. practice. The surface of the stone, when extracted, should be carefully examined, as its appearance will gene- rally point out whether there are other calculi or not. If any part of it is found flattened, or parti- cularly smooth, it must probably have been the result of friction with another calculus ; and the bladder must be attentively and repeatedly ex- amined, to ascertain whether this is the case or not. The examination of the cavity of the bladder should always, as far as possible, be made with the finger, to learn whether any loose fragments of stone, any adhesive mucous deposit, or any sabulous matter remain behind; for in either case the bladder may require to be well washed out by means of the syringe and warm water. Experience has shewn that either of these substances may, if neglected, become the nucleus for a future stone to form upon. The haemorrhage that occurs either in, or imme- diately subsequent to the operation, may sometimes require either such pressure locally as may prevent its continuance, or perhaps the dilatation of the wound, in order that, if possible, the artery may be taken up. Where the first expedient will answer.

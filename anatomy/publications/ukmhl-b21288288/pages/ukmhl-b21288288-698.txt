156 PRODUCTION OF FALSE PASSAGES. cularly where the operation has been performed by the patient himself, it has been frequently found after death that the point of the instrument, losing the true line of direction at the curve of the urethra, has pressed for some time obliquely against the side of the canal, in this way producing a degree of de- pression, while the inner membrane of the urethra pushed before the point of the instrument, has been by this means formed into a transverse ridge. Where this consequence has taken place to a greater extent, thatwhich was atfirstonly a slight depression becomes a cavity, and this cavity in the course of time will form, a tube, which according to the circumstances of the case may lead out from the posterior part of the urethra towards the rectum, or pass backward in a line parallel to the course of the natural canal, the inner membrane only being interposed between it and the urethra; or should the accident have taken place in the prostatal part of the urethra, the false passage may take its course through some part of the substance of the prostate gland into the bladder, or it may, as in the other part of the urethra, form a passage parallel to the proper line of the natural canal, so that when the instrument is introduced it will pass along between the substance of the prostate gland and the mem- brane covering it, subsequently making its way out again into the cavity of the bladder. .

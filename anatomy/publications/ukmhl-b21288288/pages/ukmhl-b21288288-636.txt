9* TREATMENT OF IRRITATION FROM STONE. acidulous soda water, and caustic alkali, and occa- sionally the exhibition of tonic and stomachic medi- cines. All these remedies are occasionally useful in relieving the severity of the paroxysm, or fit of the stone. From the power which the alkaline solutions pos- sess in dissolving the concretes of uric acid out of the body, it was long believed they might be so ex- hibited as to effect the same desirable purpose while the calculus yet remained in the bladder; but all the experiments that have been made with this view have turned out unsatisfactory and fruitless; and their failure, when taken internally, has been attri- buted to the alterations produced by the act of as- similation, and the passage through the circulation of the blood. The French chemists indeed have proposed get- ting over this difficulty at once by injecting the so- lutions of the alkalies directly into the bladder, by the urethra; but after having been repeatedly tried in this,-country, the practice is now entirely aban- doned as useless and pernicious, not dissolving the calculus, but permanently injuring the bladder.

There were however still several considerable difficulties in cutting through the perinagum, so that it was at length proposed to extract the stone by a wound made into the upper part of the bladder, by cutting above the pubis and this mode of extracting was distinguished by the name of the High Operation. It was first introduced by Pierre Franco, in the year 1561; but the obvious risk of opening into the general cavity of the abdomen, and the conse- quences Hkely to ensue from this accident, were so many dangers and objections which prevented this mode of operating ever being generally adopted. The original ideaof the operation at present in use, appears to have been derived from that which was proposed and practised in France by Frere Jaques a monk, who in 1697 taught in Paris his method of cut- ting for the stone. He passed a large staff into the ^ bladder, and v/ith this to direct him he plunged a short dagger-shaped knife at once through the perinaeum into the bladder, and then removed the stone with the forceps.

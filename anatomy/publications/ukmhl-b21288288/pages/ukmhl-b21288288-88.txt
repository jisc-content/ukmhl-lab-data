72 ON PAINFUL AFFECTIONS ing for professional assistance until within a few days of her death. Her complaint at this time was an extreme and excruciating severity of pain in the head, often producing temporary confusion of mind, and sometimes low wandering delirium. The skin was hot and dry, the tongue white, and the pulse very quick, and rather hard, but small. There was no direct paralytic affection, yet the motions of the limbs were not performed with the same prompt decision, as in health. A large blis- ter was immediately applied to the neck, and some aperient medicines given ; sixteen ounces of blood also were taken from the arm. The following day she thought the pain in her head rather better. The medicine had operated upon the bowels. In other respects the symptoms remained. The pulse being extremely small, a second bleeding was considered unadviseable till other means had failed of success. Saline, and diaphoretic medicines, therefore, were directed, for the present. She now complained of a great sense of coldness, which was compared to cold water pouring upon her head. This sensation ex- tended itself from the crown of the head down the neck and back; and as the disease proceeded towards its close, this nervous sensation became more and more frequent and distressing to her. This poor woman continued to decline for several days more, the feverish symptoms assuming a ty- phoid character; she then gradually sunk into a comatose state, and expired.

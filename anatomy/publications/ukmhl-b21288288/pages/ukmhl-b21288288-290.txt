ON SOME AFFECTIONS OF THE "the tube of the intestine, previous to their inoscu- lation with the vessels from the opposite side of the gut. On tracing the course of the bowel downwards, many parts of the small intestines were found thick- ened, from inflammation. It was also ascertained, that a considerable quantity of foecal matter was flowing loose in the general cavity. This circum- stance sufficiently explained the curious appear- ance from increased action, just observed, upon the bowels. The contents of the intestines were found to have â€¢ escaped from an opening, ulcerated through the peritoneal coat of the ilium, near the colon. This opening was nearly circular, and almost half an inch in diameter. The thin membrane or valve of peri- toneum was found still attached to one part of the margin of the opening. On examining the cavity at this part of the in- testine, it appeared that the inflammatory and ulcerative action had gradually destroyed the vil- lous surface and muscular coats of the bowels, until the remaining film was too weak to resist the impression of the peristaltic action in passing for- ward the contents, and it had consequently given way. On several parts of the peritoneum lining the parietes of the abdomen, appearances of inflamma- tion were observed, corresponding to those upon the bowels. From the symptoms and appearances, in this case, it seems pretty clear, that for a certain time

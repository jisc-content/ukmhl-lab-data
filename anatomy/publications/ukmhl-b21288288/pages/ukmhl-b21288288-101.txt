85 OF THE BRAIN. The following case exhibits an instance, in which the functions of the brain remained perfect during the progress of a very extraordinary disease, that produced absorption of a part of the cranium, and also of a considerable quantity of the brain itself, without any correspondent affection of intellect whatever. Case 27. Absorption of Brain, from a 2umor external to it. W. Robinson, a middle aged man, was admitted into St. George's Hospital, in 1815, for an affection of the left eye, the sight of which was much im- paired, and eventually altogether lost. The pro- gress of the disease was extremely painful, and as the most likely means for preventing worse con- sequences, he was advised to have the eye removed by an operation ; to which proposal he consented. The operation was performed April 17; * and on subsequent examination of the eye-ball, the whole of the vitreous humour was found converted into an opaque mass, in colour and consistence re- sembling grumous or coagulated blood. The globe of the eye was somewhat enlarged, but only in a trifling degree. The wound went on well, and he was discharged from the hospital, to all appearance perfectly cured. Soon afterwards, however, he perceived the eye- lids upon the affected side were becoming full, * By Mr. Brodie. G 3

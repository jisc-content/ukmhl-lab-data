AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. "^75 She continued to go on very well till she had reached the forty-eighth year of her age, about which period, being from family circumstances, much exposed to inclement weather, and still more to uneasiness and vexation, she was suddenly at- tacked with a violent pain extending down the thigh, and even beyond the knee. This prevented her at once from moving about, and confinement to bed for many months followed; from this she at length recovered, although but very slowly. In January 1815, four years subsequent to this attack, she had not entirely lost the pain about the knee, nor yet completely recovered her former degree of strength, in the affected limb. The original dislocation in the above case, ap- pears to have been most probably unconnected either with laceration of the capsule, or rupture of the round ligament of the joint. This opinion is much strengthened by the very great improve- ment that after a time took place in the power of moving and bearing upon the hmb, which ira- provement could only have arisen from the esta- blishment of the series of operations above de- monstrated, in the production of a new joint, which operations essentially require that the cap- sular ligament of the articulation remain entire. The direction of the luxation in this, as in most instances, was upwards and backwards ; a part of the capsular ligament must consequently have been pressed between the convex surface of the head of the femur and the periosteum external to the margin of the acetabulum. Under these cir-

An intimate acquaintance with the minute, as weU as the general anatomy of the urinary organs, wiU afFord the only clue by which we can expect to find any rational ground, upon which to explain the various symptoms that occur, in many of the dis- eases of these parts. With the assistance of anatomy we are able to perceive on the one hand that the nerves distributed to these organs are extremely numerous, although they are small, and that in addition to this there is yet another provision, in the lateral connections which the ganglia of these nerves form with each other; while on the other hand a very general source of the sympathetic feeling of one part for another, arises out of a similarity of structure in the two parts, and very frequently the existence of a continued line of similar organization between

438 ON DISEASE IN THE The disengaged margin of the bone was now very gently elevated with a probe passed under it, and separated from its soft vascular bed; in this way it was separated without the least pain, and almost without shedding a drop of blood. The surface from which the bone had been raised was a very vascular, tender, granulated mass, which formed the only remaining medium of connection between the exfoHated portion of bone, and the body of the tibia. The exfoliated piece was cleared by maceration, and then examined with a microscope. The cen- tral part, as above noticed, retained its natural appearance, but the surrounding surface appeared raised up into the finest open texture, which, on subsequent examination, was found to be produced, not by any disturbance of the natural structure of the bone, but as the result of a new deposit of os- sific matter between the surface of the periosteum, and that of the bone j dependent on that pecuHar increase of activity in the circulation, which Mr. Hunter styled the ossific adhesive inflammation.* In this view of the appearances the central sur- face of the bone pointed out the extent of periosteum which had perished from the primary effect of the blow, so that upon this spot the surface "of the bone * Pi ATE 6.

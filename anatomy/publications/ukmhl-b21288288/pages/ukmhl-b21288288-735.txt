IRRITATIONS PRODUCED BY STRICTURE. 19^ ing to the constitution ; in this stage of the com- plaint also, it not unfrequently happens that the irritable state of the bladder is found to operate as a cause of aggravation to the contraction in the urethra, the stricture becoming so much narrower that the urethra is rendered very nearly, if not com- pletely, impervious. When the disease has reached this point it becomes essential to the patient's ex- istence that the urine should find some other means of escaping from the bladder; a provision that must be made either by the efforts of nature, or the exertion of art. Sect. 8. On the subsequent Consequences of the Disease^ Ul- ceration of the Urethra^ Abscess, and Fistulce. In this stage of the progress of the disease there is usually a very considerable degree of permanent contraction in the urethra, to which is superadded occasional attacks of severe spasmodic action, con- nected with the other sympathetic affections that have been already described, and by the joint ope- ration of these complaints several new conse- quences of the disease are now brought forward. The continued irritation from the stricture ex- cites perpetual uneasiness and discharge from the anterior part of the urethra. The constant ex* ertion and aggravated straining to empty the o

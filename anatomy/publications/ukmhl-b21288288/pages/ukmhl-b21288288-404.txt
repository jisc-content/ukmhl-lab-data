ON HIP DISEASE. to remain in the hospital for nearly three months, and when the parts were healed, he was sent home. He remained well for between three and four months, when, after playing about carelessly, he was seized in the night with violent pain, total numbness in the Hmb from the knee downwards, with most, severe shooting pains through and about the hip joint. He was treated as before. The upper abscess slowly filled with matter, which, after five weeks suffering and fever, made its escape by the old opening, and discharged copiously for more than four months, during which period he was confined to his bed, but by degrees he then improved. Eighteen months now passed before the parts became perfectly healed and sound. Finding that from these ill consequences of the original accident, he was never likely to be able to earn his bread by any active employment, he learned the shoemaking business, at which, aided by his own attention to himself, he now passed so long a period as eleven years without any fresh mischief. He still found, however, that the slight- est slip, sudden movement, or jerk to the parts, in- variably re-produced pricking or shooting pains, with stiffness, about the hip. At the termination of this period, a fresh attack of inflammation came on suddenly in the night, as it had done before. He remained at home, and poulticed for three weeks, when a gathering having formed, it burst at the old place above the trochan- ter. The discharge continued for five months.

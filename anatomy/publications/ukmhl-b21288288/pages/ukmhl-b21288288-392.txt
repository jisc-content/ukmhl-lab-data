37^ ON LUMBAR ABSCESS. an abscess may take place in a part, merely from irritation in its neighbourhood. Here was abscess followed by disease and caries of the sacrum, in- ducing a consequent suppurative action in the midst of a large muscle that was totally uncon- nected with the original affection, except by the circumstance of its vicinity. Authors have in some instances spoken rather too positively of the formidable mischief that must in every instance be expected to take place, when- ever a collection of matter is allowed to remain beneath a fascia, involving destruction of the mus- cles and periosteum, and caries in the bone. That these evils may generally be apprehended in such circumstances, is most true, but where either the fears of the patient, or an obviously bad state of constitution, offer objections to the evacuation of the contents of a large abscess, it is very right the surgeon should be aware that it does not neces- sarily follow that the patient is to lose his life, or even his limb. I have seen one instance strongly illustrative of this fact. The same poor woman, some circumstances of whose case have been al- ready mentioned*, had enjoyed pretty good health till January 1810, when she was exposed to the wet and fatigue of a very heavy wash, within a fortnight after a severe lying in. She took a vio- lent cold, first affecting her limbs and joints with severe pains and swelUng. These complaints con- nected with the most acute pains in her back, had See Case 49.

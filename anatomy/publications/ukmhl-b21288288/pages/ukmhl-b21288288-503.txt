AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. ^79 surface of the iUumby the head of the femur, there is upon this preparation a decided elevation of the margin of the concavity, which elevation is not the result of any new deposit of ossific matter, but evidently the consequence of the continued pres- sure of the head of the femur, gradually disturbing and raising the ossific structure along the margin of the depressed space. This appearance seems to have arisen from some latent tendency in the con- stitution to moliities ossium, an idea that is render- ed more probable by the general appearance of the bone, which, from its Hghtness and want of mus- cular sharpness of character, certainly belonged to a female subject. In the third case there is every reason to believe the fabric of the joint as related to the ligaments of the articulation, remained entire. A close at- tention to the appearance of this bone, compared with those above described, will prove that the round ligament was not only entire, but that its strength was so adequate to the restraining the head of the femur, that the dislocation was scarcely com- plete. This is shewn, not only by the distance between the old acetabulum, and the head of the femur, being in this instance much less than in either of the former cases, for it is also demon- strated by the following circumstance in the ap- pearance of the bone. In the first, and particu- larly in the second case, the margin of tlie bone immediately below Poupart's hgament, presents a deep depression, where the tendinous parts of the psoas magnus, and ihacus internus muscles pass

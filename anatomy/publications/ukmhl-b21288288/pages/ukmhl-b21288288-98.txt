82 ON THE AFFECTIONS Examinatio7i. Before opening the head, it was measured with a tape; the greatest circumference was found to be 28 inches, and the distance across from the tip of the one ear to that of the other, 14 inches. In raising the calvarium, the dura mater was so firmly adherent at the sutures that it was scarcely possible by any means to effect a separation with- out injury to the brain; some parts of this mem- brane that could not be detached, v/ere therefore cut away with the bone. The cranium itself was remarkably thick and heavy, although towards the vertex, it was in parts diaphanous. On the external surface the dura mater was found to be, in several places, diseased. Numerous scales of ossific matter were deposited between its external laminaa. Upon raising, and laying back the dura mater, a thin vesicle or bladder, looking like a very large hydatid, was pressed up from between the two hemispheres of the brain. This appearance was situated exactly over where the corpus callosum is commonly found. By the unusual difficulty that had occurred in. separating the upper part of the skull this vesicle had suffered injury, and a considerable quantity of watery fluid had escaped. On lightly pressing the external sides of either hemisphere, a copious stream of serum sprung forth from a large cavity within the brain. What remained was now received in a vessel, as

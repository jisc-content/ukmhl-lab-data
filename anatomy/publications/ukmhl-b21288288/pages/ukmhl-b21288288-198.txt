Case 54. hijlammation and extensive Suppuration mthin the Peri- cardium, * James Rewler, a stout man, a coachman, about thirty years of age, was suddenly attacked on the night of August 14, 1800, with excessive pain over the lower part of the chest, and part of the ab- domen, attended with difficulty of breathing, great heat and thirst. The pulse was quick, hard, and full. A large bleeding, a bhster, and proper medi- cines, gave him very considerable relief But the pain confined to the chest returned very violently on the following day. It was now attended with great oppression, difficulty of breathing, and irregu- larity of pulse. Bleeding from the arm, leeches to the chest, and a blister were again directed, wdth great advantage, and repeated, though more spa- ringly, ^on the 21st and 24th, after which the symp- toms were less violent. The pulse now became quick and small, and on the least exertion extremely irregular, at times scarcely perceptible for some minutes. * The following history, with the preparation exhibiting the contents of the chest, are preserved in Mr. Heaviside's Mu- reum.

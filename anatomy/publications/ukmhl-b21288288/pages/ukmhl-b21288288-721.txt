OF THE URETHRA. 179 N 2 membranous portions of the canal, and that the only part sparingly furnished with irritability, and therefore not provided for occasional excitement and action, is that portion of the urethra which passes through the prostate gland. Upon the internal surface of the urethra nume- rous small openings may be observed, and into each of these minute openings a common bristle may be passe<i obHquely backward for about 1-8th of an inch. These are the orifices of the lacunae of the urethra. They furnish a certain proportion of the mucous matter by which the surface of the- urethra is kept continually moistened, they exhibit one of the simplest forms of glandular structure with which we are acquainted, and, like other glandular parts, they are liable to inflammation ; in which case they are subject to enlargement, may secrete purulent matter, or may become the seat of abscess. The most complicated function of the urethra is that which it performs in concert with the parts im- mediately surrounding it in the expulsion of the semen; during the excitement that immediately pre- cedes the act the seminal fluid is accumulated in. the bulbous part of the urethra, preparatory to emission, and upon the spasm taking place, the membranous part that leads backward into the bladder is so closely contracted as to be completely shut up, while the bulbous part of the canal, toge- ther with the stronger muscles surrounding it, con-

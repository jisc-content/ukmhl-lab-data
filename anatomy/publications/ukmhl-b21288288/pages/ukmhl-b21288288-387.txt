367 ON LUMBAR ABSCESS. channel extending within the muscle down as low as the groin, and upwards to the vertebrae of the loins. On enlarging the external opening of the abscess at the loins, and following thence the course of the cavity upwards and backwards, the finger came at once against the carious body of one of the lumbar vertebra; and when the parts were fairly exposed by dissecting within the abdomen, the bodies of the second and third lumbar vertebras were found almost entirely destroyed by caries, but the ulceration had not in the least acted upon the intervertebral substance, which I particularly observed remained perfectly sound between the carious bodies of the vertebra, although this liga- mentous structure must have been for months bathed in purulent matter. The whole extent of the muscle in which the abscess had formed, was reduced almost to a pu- trescent, pulpy state, having in most parts lost its natural colour, and become nearly black. - In many instances of diseased spine however, the appearances afford a strong contrast with those above-mentioned. In this instance external vio- lence was certainly the principal, if not the sole cause of all the mischief. The abscess formed within the belly of a muscle, the matfer destroying the bone, after having disorganized the periosteum, without evincing any power of producing disease in the intervertebral substance. But in other cases.

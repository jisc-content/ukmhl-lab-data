440 ON DISEASE IN THE that upon the left leg healed very rapidly, and that upon the right improved as fast as the nature of the injury would admit j but as he subsequently obtained leave to go home to see his friends, he left the hos- pital, and I heard no more of him. Oase 114. Diseased Tibia* Thomas Ivis, a strong country lad, aged seven- teen, was at plough the first week in December 1811, and from being wet the whole day, caught a severe cold ; it did not however prevent his sleep- ing well the following night. 'The next morning he thought he had got the cramp in his leg,' it felt so stiffand painful, but he was again at plough all day, wet and cold. In this way he went on, becoming every hour worse with pains extending through his leg and knee, till on the fifth day he was no longer able to leave his bed. His leg had now become much swelled ; it was hot, very red, and exceedingly painful. Added to this, he was feverish, with great thirst, and extreme restlessness. He lay without advice for a week, at the end of which period the swelling upon the leg had much increased, and the integuments covering the tibia, near the knee, gave way from excessive distention, and a watery lymph oozed out from the fissure, but without any appearance of matter. * For the opportunity of observing the progress and event of the following case, I am indebted to Mr. Brodie, whose kind at- tentions to me on various occasions, I feel much pleasure m acknowledging.

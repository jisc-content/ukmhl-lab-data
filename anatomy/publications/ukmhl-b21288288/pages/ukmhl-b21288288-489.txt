467 AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. H H ^ of the humerus is a more extended, and a lighter structure than the margin of the articulating sur- face of the scapula, and as absorption of the bone is, in this instance, the result of an irritation that operates indifferently, and consequently removes first, that which is most readily acted upon, a part of the head of the humerus is found to be absorbed. Again, as the direction of the pressure regulates the effect, which is the absorption, the new de- pression upon the head of the bone will necessarily be conformable to the figure of that part of the glenoide cavity opposed to it, and in this way the two bones will again be made to present to each other a comparatively broad surface of contact, and as this change takes place, the patient, in the course of time, recovers in some degree the power of moving his arm. But in the case last related, the pain and ten- derness felt in the joint was such as to prove, that when violently strained, the capsular ligament may suffer considerably from irritation; and carrying the idea forward, by supposing the luxated bone to remain unreduced, it is natural to expect that the increased vascular action in the capsular liga- ment, will by degrees, extend itself to those vessels, passing from the margin of the capsule to the continuous periosteum covering the bone, and the consequence of a certain kind of increased action in these vessels, is now known to be the excite- ment of the ossific action, or as Mr. Hunter would call it, " the ossific adhesive processand the particular figure of the bone so deposited, will of

184. ON SOME OF THE times said his " heart ached," but tea, or any thing warm seemed to relieve him temporarily. Almost every day, however, on returning from school, he for some time made this same complaint. In the course of the next month (February,) he remained much the same in general respects; vv^hen one day his mother coming into the room, found the child standing up, talking wildly in a delirium, and declaring the room was full of people. This was on a Saturday. He was got to bed, and there remained till the next day, when he was again sen- sible, but said he felt poorly, and not well enough to go his usual walk. Towards evening he became worse, and soon fell into a raging fever and un- governable delirium, running about the room, and destroying every thing that came in his way. The poor woman now applied for assistance to the St. George's Infirmary. The apothecary was good enough to see the child the same evening, and directed for him. Although light-headed, he frequently observed *' his heart ached j" and when laid in bed, he requested to be supported with pillows. He passed a bad night with considerable fever, and great oppression at the chest. He was visited early the following day, and regu- larly afterwards; in the course of a week, the treat- ment recommended, not having produced any satis- factory change in his favour, two very large blisters were directed to be laid, one upon cash side the chest. These were evidently useful, and the child felt so much better in consequence, that he was extremely impatient to have more applied.

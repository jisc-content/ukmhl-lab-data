OF THE BRAIN. 141 Examination. On dividing the integuments, a considerable ef- fusion of blood was found deposited in the cellu- lar membrane between the pericranium, covering the superior portions of the parietal bones, and the corresponding part of the scalp. This extravasa- tion of blood was equal to about an ounce and an half in quantity. Within the cranium extravasa- tion had taken place to a very considerable extent. Tlie smaller arteries upon the pia mater had given way, and effusion of blood, over every part of the brain, had been the consequence. This appear- ance, however, was most remarkable about the basis of the brain. Some small sections of the cortical and medullary substance of the brain were next made, and here also the capillary arteries had given way almost universally. The extravasation seemed to have been entirely confined to the capillary vessels, and the appearance was only found near the surfaces of the brain; the small coagula were most of them about the size of pins' heads, some few only being larger. Within the lateral ventricles the plexus choroides was fbu,nd heavy and compact, from a quantity of effused blood, which had been poured out into the cellular texture connecting the two laminae of this membranous expansion.

The particular course of the symptoms has in certain cases led to the belief, that the irri-, tation produced either by the affection of the pros- tate gland or by the obstructions in the urethra, is capable of extending itself very considerably, so as to explain the eventual derangement in the func- tions of the kidneys. There can be no doubt that any hindrance to the free evacuation of the urine, whether the obstruc- tion arises from enlargement of the prostate gland, or from stricture in the urethra, will have a strong tendency to prevent the escape of small calculi, and also favor the precipitation of mucous, sabu- lous, and calculous matter from the urine in the bladder, circumstances which have more or less in- fluence in forwarding the production of stone in the bladder, and aggravating materially the symptoms incident to the other complaints with which it may be connected.

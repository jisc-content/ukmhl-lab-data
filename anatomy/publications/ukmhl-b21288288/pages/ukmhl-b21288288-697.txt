INTRODUCTION OF THE CATHETER. 1^*^ In those instances where the introduction of the flexible catheter has been effected with difficulty, it will be necessary that it be allowed to remain in the bladder for a certain number of days, for the purpose of ensuring the bladder being relieved at regular and stated intervals, either twice or thrice in the course of the twenty-four hours. In this case, the end of the instrument that projects externally must be carefully secured to a T bandage passed round the waist, so as to prevent the possibility of its escaping entirely into the bladder, an acci- dent that might involve very serious consequences. When an affection of the prostate gland is in that stage of its progress as to require the introduc- tion of a catheter, the instrument should always be selected of as large a size as the circumstances of the case will admit. The rounded extremity of a full sized catheter presents a comparatively broad surface to any little obstruction that may occur, upon which account it is to be preferred, being in- finitely less liable to take a wrong direction than a smaller sized instrument would be.

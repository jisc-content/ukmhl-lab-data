392 ON HIP DISEASE. membrane was rendered, by inflammation, so in- durated, as to resemble gizzard in its consistence. An abscess of considerable extent was found in the cellular membrane between the glutaeal muscles; which abscess was connected by a fistulous passage with the carious trochanter, and also with an exter- nal opening upon the hip. Within the hip-joint there was no material ap- pearance of disease. The perichondrium and car- tilage exhibited a dull, lurid appearance; and the ligamentum teres resembled a membranous ex- pansion folded longitudinally, having entirely lost its natural characters, both as to figure and strength. These changes, however, were pro- bably little more than the necessary consequence of a long season of confinement, with a disease going forward in the immediate vicinity of the joint. In the muscular structure of the tensor vaginae femoris anterior to the joint, was a small capsule of condensed cellular membrane full of a soft cretaceous matter; and in the carious cavity that had formed just below the great trochanter, there were several small masses about the size of grains of sago, of a similar secretion. The periosteum was detached for some distance round the carious part of the â€¢ trochanter, and a purulent matter was lodged be- tween it and the bone. The parts about the knee-joint were examined, but were, to appearance, perfectly sound within the joint; the crucial ligaments, however, were reduced to the state of membranous webs, while the cap-

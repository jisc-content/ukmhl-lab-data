ON LUMBAR ABSCESS. S7I had been discharged during life, was of a dark- brown colour, and highly offensive. The purulent cavity within the psoas magnus was as long as the muscle itself^ and in fact occu- pied nearly the whole of the space within the mem- branous sheath of the muscle, most of the muscular structure having been absorbed or converted into pus. The inner surface of this cavity was covered with a thick layer of coagulable lymph, which had a scrofulous appearance, as well as the contained matter. The sacrum, and three lower lumbar vertebrae were removed, macerated and cleaned ; and in the last part of this process a very curious circum- stance came to light. On washing and clearing off the soft parts, I unexpectedly found the two inferior oblique, together with the spinous process of the last lumbar vertebrae, separated from the body of the bone.

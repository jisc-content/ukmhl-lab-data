FUNGUS H^MATODES OP THE BLADDER. that more or less of blood came away with the urine. For this new symptom she took some me- dicine, which, to use her own words, only seemed to " bring down the blood" more freely and fre- quently than before. Thus she went on, her com- plaints still continuing gradually to increase. For the last three months previous to her appli- cation at the Infirmary she had been greatly dis- tressed by wandering pains about the loins, and these latterly became more fixed and settled in the hips. The irritation to pass water was now so con- stant and severe as to reproduce the efforts, which were attended with the most severe straining about every ten minutes. Position made no difference, for it returned as regularly through the night as in the day. When the pains were most violent she generally passed a little pure blood with her water in small quantity. The poor woman had about this time been per- suaded by an acquaintance, to sit over the steam of warm water, with a view to relieve her pains. This expedient seemed at first to produce some degree of ease, but eventually it was found only to en- crease the haemorrhage, and she consequently gave it up. An examination was made per vaginam, but the enquiry afforded no clue to the nature of her dis- ease, for the vagina and os uteri were in a perfectly natural state.

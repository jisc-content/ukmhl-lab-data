36 AFFECTIONS OF PARTS of late become somewhat larger, and more un- healthy, and now a little matter was discovered to ooze out (especially upon coughing), through a few exceedingly small openings in the skull. Upon this intimation, a pretty large circular piece of the scalp was removed by incision from around the part first affected, and the trepan was immediately applied on two contiguous portions of the cranium, through which however but little matter was dis- charged. After the operation, every circumstance seemed to promise success for about three weeks, when the discharge from within the skull began to in- crease, and continued to do so every day. Matter likewise formed externally, and spreading, separated a good deal of scalp from the skull, both on the riffht and left side of the head. The matter was let out as soon as discovered, and the further pro- gress of the suppuration it was endeavoured to obviate by pressure and bandage. Notwithstanding these measures the suppuration went on spreading, and detached the greater part of the integuments, so as to render it fruitless to make any more openings. One abscess in particular formed near the right eye, swelling it up. This gathering was poulticed, and in a few days opened. Another upon the occiput was opened a few days afterwards. In about ten days more he was seized with a very violent rigor, which held him full three hours, and on the third day afterward, he expired.

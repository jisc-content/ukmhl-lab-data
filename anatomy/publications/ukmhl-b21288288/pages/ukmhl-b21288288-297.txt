STOMACH AND INTESTINAL CANAL. ^79 T 4 Examination. The abdomen externally was tense and livid. Within, the omentum was perfectly sound, but somewhat thickened from inflammation, and ad- herent very firmly to the left side of the cavity of the abdomen. These adhesions it was necessary to divide by the knife. Part of the intestine jeju- num was found tied up in a heap, as witb a cord. The band was formed by what appeared to be most like muscular or fleshy fibres, compleatly surrounding that portion of the bowels, and pre- venting the passage either of solids or fluids, down- wards. The part obstructed formed a portion of the alimentary canal of very considerable extent. The intestine, from the obstruction upward, was quite livid, and greatly distended with a brown fsecal liquid matter, by which the stomach also was filled. The coats of this part of the intestine were so tender and pulpy, as to readily burst in han- dling. That part of the intestinal canal below the obstruction was in a sound state. The stomach was large, and very flaccid. Seve- ral livid spots appeared on various parts of its in- ternal surface. All the other viscera were sound. Case 82.

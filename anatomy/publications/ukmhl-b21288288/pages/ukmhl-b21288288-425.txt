405 OF THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. D D 3 the cellular membrane of the arm and wrist. Ex- amination was, at this period of the complaint, at- tended with extreme pain. When the upper end of the ulna was held firmly, and the lower end gently moved to and fro, a peculiar grating sensation, a» well as a degree of looseness in the affected part of the bone, were so clearly perceptible, as to lead to a suspicion that the two ends of the bone were ei- ther nearly, or totally disunited. The ulna, just below its middle, evidently diseased, the sharp spi- cule of bone producing, on the least pressure, a sensation like the prickHng of needles, while the • bare surface of the exposed bone was readily de- tected with a probe. The discharge of matter was abundant; and fo- mentations were constantly applied till the end of the third month after the accident, when the ex- ternal opening from the abscess was again enlarged, by extending it down to the wrist. This little ope- ration gave much present pain, but so much subse- quent relief, that he slept better tlie following night, than he had done for two months before. A few days after this, two small fragments of carious bone • were found in the wound, and removed, and this re- lieved him from considerable irritation. The arm now remained in a cool, quiet state for some weeks. The heat, tenderness, and swelling nearly gone ; the extent of remaining ulceration trifling. On examination, the sensation of dis- union in the bone was still perceptible, but less dis- tinct than before. A considerable tumefaction of bone, along the inferior margin of the ulna, still remained.

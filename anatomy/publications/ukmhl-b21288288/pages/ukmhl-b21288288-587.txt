Purulent matter was also found loose in the abdomen, a circumstance which was explained by lightly pressing the membrane, confining the contents of the abscess, for then more matter was seen to pour out by a small round hole, ulcerated through the peritoneum. By this opening a probe was introduced, and the membrane was then di- vided upward and downward, to the extent of the abscess.

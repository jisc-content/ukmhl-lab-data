Where this however cannot be done, the stone may be repeatedly touched with the blades of the forceps, previous to their being opened, so as to enable the operator not only to ascertain its precise situation, but to furnish him also with some idea of its magnitude and figure, before he attempts to grasp it with the instrument. Sometimes the fundus; of the bladder will reÂ» quire to be supported, and raised up a little by two of the fingers of the left hand introduced into the rectum, to enable the forceps to take a fau* hold of the calculus.

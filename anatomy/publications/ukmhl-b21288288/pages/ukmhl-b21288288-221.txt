AFFECTIONS OF THE LUNGS. 205 tainly contained a fluid, it was not aqueous, but wholly coagulable by heat, or nearly so. The form and magnitude of these appendiculag were various; some of the largest were near two inches in length, and three-quarters of an inch in their largest diameter. The colour was more uni- form, it was a semi-transparent, dull yellow. From their pecuHar texture, they were unquestionably the result of an effiision of coagulable lymph, and were, when examined, partly in a fluid, and partly in a solid state. The external surface was formed by a coagulated pellicle, and this was distended with fluid lymph. The immersion of these bodies in alcohol, ren- dered the external pellicle more opaque, increasing its density, as well as its thickness. The pro- portion of fluid contents also was diminished by the action of the spirit coagulating progressively, that part of the fluid nearest the surface. The disease itself, unluckily, was not cut into at the time, but being immersed in spirit to mace- rate, by a concurrence of accidental circumstances, it was eventually lost sight of. Its texture, however, was extremely firm to the feel, and from its weight, which was between eight and nine pounds, there was at the time no doubt en- tertained that the structure must be of a scirrhous nature, although I know of no other instance of such disease in the lungs. The following case is an instance in which of-

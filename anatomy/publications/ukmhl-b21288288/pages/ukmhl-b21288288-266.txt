248 ON SOME AFFECTIONS When he came into the hospital, he had a con- stant uneasiness, and a tickling cough upon him ; the skin had the yellow appearance of jaun- dice. He complained also of constant pain about his right side. The expectoration was usually- pretty free. It was certainly purulent, and fire- (juently had the yellow colour and appearance of being mixed with bile in considerable quantity, and when this appearance prevailed, he always found the taste was extremely bitter. For these complaints, he was blistered thrice upon the side, had expectorating medicines, and was placed under a course of calomel. The mouth was kept under the influence of these medicines for some time, till he was evidently much reduced, while the symptoms were rather aggravated than reheved; that is to say, the pain, the cough, and the quantity of expectorated bitter and yellow bilious fluid, and the yellowness upon the skin, were greater than before. After persevering in this treatment for two months, it was changed. The mercury laid aside, light tonics were substituted, with occasional ex- pectorants and opiates. The patient, however, was sensibly declining into a state of extreme debility and emaciation, and had now a muttering, low delirium towards evening. His pulse had been always quick, but small. A remarkable circumstance in this young man*s complaint was an invariable constipation. His bowels were never regular since he had been ill.

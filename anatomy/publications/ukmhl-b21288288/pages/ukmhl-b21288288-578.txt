36 DEPOSITION OF THE PHOSPHATES, &C. about the bladder. There was constant desire'' to pass the water, which was voided in small quantities, with sharp cutting pain about the neck of the blad- der, great straining, and frequently with bleeding. There was also some degree of retraction of the testicle upon the right side, and a sense of numbness extending down the fore part of the thigh. On examining the urine, it was not found to be particularly loaded with mucus, but deposited a cal- culous matter, which, although it contained some few particles of red gravel, was principally formed of the white sand. He was desired to refrain altogether from the use of fermented liquors, and was ordered ten drops of the muriatic acid, to be taken in water, three times a-day. Under this plan, he soon found his complaints re- lieved. The symptoms from irritation, however, had began to decline, some time before any dimi- nution in the quantity of calculous matter formed in the urine was perceptible. In the course of a month he was so much better that he requested to be discharged. The little remaining traces of cal- culous deposit in the urine could now be only occa- sionally detected, and he observed he had not been so entirely free from pain and uneasiness, or at any time able to pass his water with so much freedom for many years past, as at present. Soon after quitting the infirmary, these com- plaints left him altogether.

148 ON THE AFFECTIONS much on the state of the constitution. The slight- est degree of inflammatory action in an instable habit, will quickly extend itself, so as to reach from the larynx, down to the smallest branches of the bronchias in the lungs; and as the sphere of irritation weakens as it extends, an increased secre- tion of viscid, glairy mucus is found deposited, to a greater extent than the inflammation has reached. From attentive observation of the secretions thrown off from this membrane when inflamed, I am led to believe, that where the irritability is extreme, and the prevailing disposition is to low fever, the coagulable matter, if coughed up, will be entirely of a yellow colour, and very much dif- fused in a purulent mixture, losing of its proper characters as pure coagulable lymph, and taking on a pulpy, and almost mucous appearance. In such cases, the appearances after death shew the extreme propensity in the increased action, to oc- cupy the whole extent of the ramifications of this membrane in the lungs, and the prospect of cure, with such appearances of excreted matter, will consequently be unfavourable. The lungs are found after death so oppressed, and choaked up by the quantity of mucus secreted into the bron- chiae, that supposing all affection of trachea re- moved, it would have been impossible for the patient to have escaped suffocation. This then appears to be one of the worst forms of the disease, in which the affection occurs with symptoms of low or typhoid febrile action in the system j and this variety of the complaint is not

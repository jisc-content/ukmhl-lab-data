With this view some caustic was applied, and the parts subsequently poulticed. From the circumstances of the case, it appeared probable that some dead bone might be confined within the cavity of the inflamed tibia, and this suspicion was rather strengthened by the examin- ation of the cavity with a probe passed in through the fistulous openings in the bone; but on re- moving a part of the external covering, so as to expose the medullary cavity with the saw described by Ambrose Parey, and since recommended by Mr. Hey, no appearance of necrosis was found.

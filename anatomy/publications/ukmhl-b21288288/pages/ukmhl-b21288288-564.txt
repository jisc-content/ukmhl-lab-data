22 CALCULOUS AFFECTION this does not depend on its preventing their secre- tion, but arises from its having the power of hold- ing these salts in solution in the urine; for in cases where this acid has been exhibited, the phosphates have been still found in excess, although in a state of solution. This fact has been further proved by suspending the exhibition of the carbonic acid for a time, an experii^ent that has been immediately followed by the precipitation of the white sand, which has again disappeared upon the renewed ex- hibition of the acid. The strongest recommendation in favour of this remedy seems to be this, that when the irritable state of the bladder will not admit the exhibition even of the vegetable acids, the carbonic acid will be particularly useful, inasmuch as it does not in- crease the irritability of the parts, notwithstanding it frequently gives the same relief to the symptoms, which in other cases the mineral acids are capable of affording. Most of the complaints incident to calculous disorders may be considered to be of a mixed cha- racter. They are derived in almost every instance from irritation, connected with which there is ge- nerally more or less of increased vascular action. The treatment of those symptoms that imme- diately arise from irritation, has generally consisted of the mildest and least stimulating regimen, with a plentiful exhibition of mucilaginous liquids.

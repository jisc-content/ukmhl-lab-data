The operation some- what relieved him, and he afterward went on for Some months without paying any further attention to it. Finding however, the contraction increasing, he again had a bougie passed several times, by which he was for a time much relieved. "With the occasional assistance of bougies he Went on pretty Well till October 1814, at which time he was passing a bougie every day. The f)arts however were more irritable than usual, and k swelling made its appearance in the perineum. As the increase of this swelling was extremely slow and the pain trifling, he supposed it of no im- J)ortance, and consequently did not at first mention it. In the course of two months however, it be- came extremely hot and painful, he now spoke of it to his medical attendant, who immediately de- sisted from using the bougie, ordering him to rub in two drachms of mercurial ointment every night upon the swelled part of the perinasum. This treatment he continued for a month, when his mouth became very sore, and he was considerably salivated. Just at this time also, a retention of urine suddenly came on. At this his attendant expressed his surprise, ordered him into a warm bath re- peatedly, applied leeches and fomentations to the perinaeum, and directed an opiate clyster to be- thrown up. 2

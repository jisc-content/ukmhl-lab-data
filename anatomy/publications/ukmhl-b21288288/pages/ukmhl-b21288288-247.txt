OF THE PERITONEUM. 229 lymph : although, when the effused fluid has been principally coagulable lymph, it seems reasonable to take into the account a certain degree of inconve- nience, and even difficulty, sustained by the sto- mach and bowels, in the performance of their func- tions. I have however examined one preparation * which, together with its history, affords a very strik- ing example of what the powers of the constitu- tion will sometimes effect, in supporting parts labouring under difficulty. The preparation illus- trates the effects of peritoneal inflammation. The effusion of coagulable lymph had been so general and so abundant, that the abdominal cavity in fact no longer existed, as the whole of the viscera were formed into one solid mass, all the parts of which were firmly connected with each other, with the peritoneum and with the parietes surrounding them. The patient notwithstanding lived for two years after this had taken place, and died eventually of mesenteric obstruction. ^ The most curious,and interesting circumstance, in the preparation, is the result of the singular situ- ation in which the bowels were placed. To pro- duce the full effect of the natural peristaltic action, a progressive and perfect contraction was neces- sary ; but this was impossible. To come near to it, must have been a work of great difficulty, re- quiring a continuation of preternatural efforts, the consequence of which> has been such an increase * In Mr. Heaviside's Museum.

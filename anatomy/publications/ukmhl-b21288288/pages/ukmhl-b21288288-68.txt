AFFECTIONS OF THE BRAIN 52 than elsewhere, as if from the effect of pressure it had become more soHd, In the middle lobe of the right hemisphere a coagulum of blood was seen indistinctly shining through the substance of the brain. On opening this part a large coagulum was found, equal to at least six ounces. It was thrown out into the sub- stance of the brain above the lateral ventricle. On examining this coagulum, the edges, parti- cularly at the posterior part, were beginning to assume the brown colour described above, and the brain in parts was putting on the same compressed appearance. The arteries at the base of the cra- nium were slightly diseased, but not ossified. Case 18. jRepeated Effusions of Blood jipon the Brain. A labouring woman aged 56, sustained the shock of an apoplectic stroke, which deprived her of her senses for many hours. She however recovered the perfect use of her faculties, and was subse- quently restored to a very good state of health. This took place in the year 1804. In 1809 she had a second attack of the same nature, and was suddenly deprived of her senses, falling down in a state of stupefaction. From this attack also she partially recovered, but although, after some time, her memory was restored, she never again enjoyed the free and perfect use of her limbs. On the contrary, she was never after able to direct her steps with any tolerable preci- sion, or even safety.

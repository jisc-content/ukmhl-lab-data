He received it from his brother, a surgeon at Bahia in Brazil, at which place it was voided without any medical assistance by an old black woman. Previous to its coming away she had for a long time suffered excruciating pain, and remained ever after subject to an incontinence of urine. Dr. Gray received no other particulars. The calculus itself is partly of an oval figure. It weighs four ounces and six drachms, troy weight. The section exhibits a loose crumbly texture com- posed of a small proportion of the phosphates, with a large one of mucous or animal matter, forming the nucleus of the stone, round which to a certain extent the phosphates have been deposited, in suc- cessive strata. Subsequently however, it appears from the structure, that the calculus took up some comparatively fixed place of abode in the bladder, in Consequence of which the stream of urine making its way constantly over one part of its surface only, has given rise to a partial accumulation of phos- phate of lime upon one of its sid^s. It appears pro- bable also, that the large spaces between the masses that form the external part of the calculus must have been owing to the particular consistence of the mucous matter at these points, around which it

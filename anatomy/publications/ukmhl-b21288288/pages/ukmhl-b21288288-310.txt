292 ON HERNIA. of contents in the abdomen is so subject to con- tinual variation, this explanation appears to be un- satisfactory. It seems more rational to conclude, that in such a state of parts, old and organized adhesions may have existed ; adhesions sufficiently elongated to admit of the complete return of the hernia, but at the same time sufficiently sensible to impart a sympathetic feel of uneasiness to the neighbouring viscera, when placed upon the stretch. Seen in this point of view, the folly of persisting obstinately in keeping up a rupture, merely because, so circumstanced, the reduction is practicable, will be evident; for by so doing, peritoneal inflammation and death may as readily follow, as from the more common circumstances attendant upon strangulated hernia, and in point of fact, it has sometimes taken place. Adhesions in the course of time are known to elongate, in other situations j and in the examination of t)ld hernise after death, I have repeatedly found them so far capable of relaxation as to allow the â€¢rupture to be partly or even completely returned into the abdomen, although such attempts, during the patient's life, had uniformly brought on un- easiness and pain, confined to the precise seat of the adherent parts of the hernia. One of the following cases of rupture affi)rds a strong illustration of the inconstancy of symptoms, even under circumstances in which we must be directed by symptoms alone, and where the event turned out most serious.

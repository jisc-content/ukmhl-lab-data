OS HEHNIA. 294 Examination. The following day the parts were examined. The hernial sac, when laid open, was found to be of considerable thickness. The contents of the sac, (which was almost gangrenous,) were some fluid fascal matter, a considerable mass of inflamed, consolidated omentum, and portions of intestine, so entirely adherent, and so involved in effused coa- gulable lymph, that it was with difficulty the parts were made out. The contents were so strongly adherent round the neck of the sac, that no en- deavour could ever have succeeded in returning the protruded parts into the abdomen. On opening the cavity of the abdomen, the ter- mination of the intestine ileum, the caecum with the appendix caeci, and the caput coli, were ascer- tained to have passed out from the abdomen into the hernial sac, together with a large proportion of the omentum, which had dragged the tranverse arch of the colon down from its natural situation towards the neck of the sac. But it was not yet ascertained by what means the fagcal matter had escaped from the cavity of the intestine into that of the hernial sac. To clear up this point, a quantity of spirits was injected in- to the arch of the colon, and it was found to issue forth from behind the caecum, between it and the sac. The adhesion at this part was therefore cautiously peeled asunder, when a small circular hole, not larger than the head of a pin, ulcerated through the peritoneal coat of the bowel, was detected, h\

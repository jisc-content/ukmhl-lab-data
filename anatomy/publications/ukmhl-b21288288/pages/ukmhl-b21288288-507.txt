AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. 481 In the fourth case, the abundant deposit has produced a very substantial bed of ossific matter, and it is particularly remarkable, in how great a degree the frequent action of the strong muscles the psoas, and internal iliac muscles, upon the femur in its new situation. d. The old acetabulum. e. The angle of the cavity, where the round ligament pass- ing over the margin of the acetabulum, to the dis- located head of the femur, had rendered the bone smooth. J". The symphysis pubis. g. The superficial depression upon the surface of the ilium, produced by the range of the head of the femur back- ward and forward, confined by the round ligament, to a certain line of action.

The angle at which the ligamentum teres passed out from the cavity of the acetabulum to the head of the dislocated femur. e. The space denoting the line of contact between the innomi- natum, and the head of the femur, subsequent to its luxation. This space is materially broader in this, than in the former instance; added to which, there is a slight elevation upon each margin of the depression, not, however, resulting from any new deposition of bone.

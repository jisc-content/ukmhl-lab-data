FUNGUS HJEMATODES OF THE BLADDER. 131 K 2 ward at particular points, gave the whole mass the jippearance of a congeries of smaller tumors. The quantity of the mass varied at different points ; at the anterior part of the bladder its great- est thickness was one inch, but at the lateral and posterior parts it was equal to two, and even three inches. The structure of the disease was principally made up of the white, soft, pulpy matter, in some points resembling cream ; although here and there a secre- tion of adipose substance had assisted in making up the quantity. In many of the smaller tumors ex- travasations of blood had taken place from the capil- lary arteries. The effused blood formed minute masses, which became apparent on cutting into the tumor; but in some it was deposited so near the sur- face as to be seen shining through the external membrane. The more internal of these tumors had protruded inward into the cavity of the bladder, pushing the mucous membrane before them. Several of these projections towards the cervix of the blad- der had rendered the mucous membrane extremely vascular, and from these vessels, in the progress of the disease, the blood had been poured out. This was proved by small filamentous coagula being found connected with them, in the examination after death. The extravasation of blood into the substance of these tumors had taken place to a greater extent in

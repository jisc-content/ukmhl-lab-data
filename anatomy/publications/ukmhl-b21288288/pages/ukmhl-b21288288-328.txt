308 ON HiEMORRHOIDAL DISEASES. Sect. 6. ON HiEMOIlRHOlDAL DISEASES. Bleeding from the hgemorrhoidal veins has been considered to depend on a praeternatural relaxa- tion of the coats of these vessels. With this view of the subject, 1 had supposed that these veins would have been found enlarged in the exami- nation of the body, in a case where hajmorrhoidal complaints had formerly existed to a consider- able extent *. But a moment's reflection would have shewn that this was hardly to be expected, for although the haemorrhoidal vessels above the sphinctor of the anus are, in point of situation, below the other contents of the abdomen, they are yet adequately supported by the surrounding parts. And upon this account, I believe, it seldom if ever happens, that vessels of any consequence give way from mere distention, fairly within the rectum. Where haemorrhage occurs within the sphinctor it seems, in general, more correct to attribute it to some diseased state of the mucous membrane of the gut, than to relaxation of the coats of any particular vessel. In 1808, I had an opportunity of removing, after death, some tumors from around the verge of the anus, where they had been stationary for years. The man, who was a sailor, had been for many years before subject to confined bowels and hge- morrhoidal complaints. This description of tumor has been generally said to arise from a varicose * See Case 29.

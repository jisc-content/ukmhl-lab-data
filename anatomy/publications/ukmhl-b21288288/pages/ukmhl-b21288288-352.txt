S32 ON INJURY OF THE TESTICLE ting into the liver at various parts, its internal structure was found perfectly healthy. Sect. 3. on injury of the testicle from external violence. The testicle, from its exposed situation, as well as from its peculiar organization, is particularly subject to enlargement from bruise, or other acci- dental violence. The ordinary effect of such acci- dent is considerable inflammation and tumor of the substance of the testicle and epidydimis, occa- sionally proceeding on to suppuration and abscess within the body of the gland. A much less fre- quent result of external violence, is abscess pro- duced by the establishment of the suppurative action in some part of the cellular membrane, be- tween the vaginal coat, and the more external coverings of the testicle. The latter consequence arises now and then, and whenever it does occur, a variation in the mode of treatment becomes necessary; but the distinction between this and the more common result of injury to the testicle, will riot in general be difficult to determine. In the one case, the tumor will be evidently an en- largement of testicle, extremely sensible to pres- sure, and of considerable weight, the scrotum being un-engaged in the afiection; in the other there will be redness, heat and tumor of the scro-

This plan, in some measure, succeeded, and it also seemed to lessen the volume of the diseased mass, but it was certainly attended with more consider- able haemorrhage from the parts, than had occurred before. Previous to poulticing, the bleedings, compara- tively trifling, were generally produced by the pas- sing of a motion, but never came on when he was at rest in bed.

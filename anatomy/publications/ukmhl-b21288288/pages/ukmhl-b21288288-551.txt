OF THE KIDNEY. 9 * See Case 8. CLilous jDaiticles; but it may be also considered as a bond of security in another point of view, for the quantity of fluid matter thrown off by this means must materially unload the vascular system of the gland, and keep in check any tendency existing in the parts, to ran beyond irritation into inflam- matory action. ' Sect. 4. 0?i Irritation and Abscess of the Kidney. â–  In particular instances of disease, the irritability would appear to be very unequally distributed, and without any more obvious cause, one particular part of the kidney, and that part only, will fre- quently be found to pass through all the gradations of diseased action, without a possibility of tracing any previously existing cause for irritation in the particular seat of the affection. I have much more frequently in the examination of bodies, found collections of purulent matter in some one part of the kidney, than those appear- ances resulting from inflammation of the whole of the gland. In one instance, however, I have known chronic inflammation and abscess of the whole kidney follow from what was at first only a sym- pathetic affection, alternating with irritability at the neck of the bladder. *

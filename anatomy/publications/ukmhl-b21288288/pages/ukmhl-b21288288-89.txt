73 OF THE BRAIN. Examination, On opening the head, the vessels upon the dura mater were unusually distended with blood. The dura mater was next separated, and laid aside, when a very excessive, and general effusion between the arachnoide membrane and the pia mater was brought into view. The deposit was principally coagulable lymph, with a small proportion of serous fluid. The spaces between the convolutions of the brain, were filled up with a yellowish and curdly purulent matter. The inflammation and efHision appeared to have been most considerable in the direction of the longitudinal sinus. The general structure of the brain was sound. In the lateral ventricles the only morbid appearance was upon the plexus cho- roides. The vessels of this membranous expan- sion had effused a considerable quantity of coa- gulable lymph, that was found in a flocculent state, together with the yellow puriform fluid. The same appearances were detected in the third, and the fourth ventricles. The traces of inflammation be- came even more obvious, as the examination was continued towards the basis of the brain. Upon tracing the medulla spinalis, where it passes down into the neck, it appeared to be completely in- volved in a copious secretion of the same sort of curdly purulent matter just described. About the basis of the brain, in general, the in- flammation had been more considerable, and the de-

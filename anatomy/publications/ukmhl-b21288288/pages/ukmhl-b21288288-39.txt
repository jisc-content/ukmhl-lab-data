On comparing the state in which the disease in each case was found after death, the principal dif- ference between the two, appears to have been in ^he texture of the ossific tumor. In the case above related the whole tumor remained continuous- and entire subsequent to maceration; while in that â™¦ recorded by Sandifort, the whole fabric fell asun- der in disjointed fragments of bone, upon the de- struction of the soft parts. In the above case the soft parts were clearly in- volved in the disease, and were probably the pri- mary seat of the affection, as well as in the case related in the Museum j^natomicum. This cir- cumstance as well as the tendency to bleeding, suggests the probability that the disease was of a cancerous nature, and that the bones, although very extensively affected, had most likely re- mained uninjured till the soft fungous vascular mass from within the cavity of the antrum began to operate, first by producing absorption of the mem- brane lining that cavity, and then by its peculiar and partially organized texture, not exciting regu- lar absorption of the bone, but sufficiently loosen- ing its general structure to admit of considerable distention in the first instance. In the progress of the disease, as might naturally be expected, the circulation in the periosteum made some efibrt to- watds repairing the mischief by the secretion of new bone, as happens in cases of necrosis, al- though this effort had, owing to tlie almost disor-

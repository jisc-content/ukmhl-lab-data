246 ON SOME AFFECTIONS the inferior surface of the kings, on the right side, and the corresponding surface of the diaphragm. In the abdomen, the appearances were the fol- lowing : the bundle of small intestines were unin- flamed, and perfectly free from any trace of disease. The colon, near its curvature upon the right side, was considerably thickened, and closely connected by adhesion with the surrounding parts. On tear- ing asunder its adhesion to the peritoneum lining the abdominal muscles, a large ulcerated hole was detected, from which a considerable quantity of curdly purulent matter, tinged with blood, escaped among the intestines. This ulcer opened into the intestine, but could not possibly have been the source, either of the hagmorrhage, or the matter col- lected in the gut; for the blood-vessels on the one hand, and the extent of ulcerated surface on the other, were too inconsiderable to allow of such an opinion. The stomach and spleen were perfectly sound. The liver, on its convex surface, near the anterior ' part of the suspensory ligament, was observed to be tumid. A division of this tumid part disco- vered a large collection of matter, lodged within the substance of a completely diseased liver. The mat- ter was of thick consistence, and a yellowish white colour. Passing the finger between the upper surface of the right side of the liver, and the diaphragm, it was found to be very extensively adherent to that muscular expansion, and posteriorly to the peri- toneal cavity.

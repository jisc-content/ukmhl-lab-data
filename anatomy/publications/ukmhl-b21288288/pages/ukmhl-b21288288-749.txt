APPLICATION OF CAUSTIC. S07 stricture, so as to aggravate the complaint it was intended tOvi-elieve, it has been ascertained that the armed or caustic bougie has the power of act- ing on the stricture, while so far from being objec- tionable on the same ground as the simple bougie, it most commonly is found to operate by diminish- ing very materially the irritability of the parts. In the irritable stricture at present under consi- deration it will sometimes be impossible to pass even the smallest bougie, or perhaps one of a small size may be made to pass, but will not fail to ag- gravate the distress of the patient. With a view to the relief of this stage of the complaint the appli- cation of lunar caustic has been recommended, be- cause it is capable of progressively acting upon, or in other words destroying, the whole of the stricture, and because as it has been very justly stated, from its tendency to relieve spasm, it may remove a part of the stricture and relax the rest. With the same view the caustic alkali has been recommended, and it has been represented as capable of accom- plishing the relaxation and relief of the stricture upon easier terms than is usual with the lunar caustic J and judging from a pretty extensive expe- rience I am persuaded that the caustic alkali is the most generally effectual, as well as the most safe of the two applications, in the irritable state of stricture. I am not aware that the rationale of the action of the caustic alkali in stricture has ever been entered

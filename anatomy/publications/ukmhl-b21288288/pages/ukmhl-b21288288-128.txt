ON THE AFFECTIONS 112 in some measure to the left side of the falx. The connexion between the brain and its membranes was at this part so very firm, tliat in raising the dura mater, a portion of the cortical substance of the brain was separated with it. There was no reason, however, to suppose that the inflammation producing this adhesion was of any recent date, for, notwithstanding the great firmness of the union, there was no remaining ap- pearance of excessive vascularity ^bout the parts. The vascular system of the brain in general was Â» certainly loaded with blood, but there was no trace of extravasation found, on dissection of the cerebrum. On the internal surface of the frontal bone, nearly opposite the anterior termination of the falx, was found a small adherent spicule of bone. It lay in a line with the sinus, and close to its mar- sin. It was rather less than half an inch in lensrth, and its elevation above the general surface of the cranium was only ^'^th of an inch. It is, perhaps, hardly to be supposed that this very small piece of bone could have conveyed any in- jurious irritation, either to the brain or its mem- branes. There were, however, different opinions upon this point. Whether this spicule of bone was originally a fras-ment broken off from the inner table of the skull by external violence, or whether produced by a growth from the bone, was a question of much uncertainty. The general idea w^as, that it had been detached in the first instance, and had subse- quently united again to the cranium; but there was no appearance upon the outer table either of

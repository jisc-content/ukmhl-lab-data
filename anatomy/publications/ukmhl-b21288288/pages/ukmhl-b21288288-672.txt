130 FUNGUS HiEMATODES OF THE BLADDER, partially inflamed, and had formed adhesions with the tumor in several parts. From each side of the tumor in the pelvis an ex- tensive chain of diseased and enlarged lymphatic glands passed upwards upon the loins, towards the root of the mesentery. The disease had produced a more considerable change and a much larger tu- mor in the lymphatics upon the left than in those upon the right side of the loins. Most of these dis- eased glands were large as a chesnut, but many were equal in size to a small apple. As it was impossible to ascertain clearly what the large tumor was, while it remained fixed in the pelvis, the whole was dis- sected away from the bones, and on examination the urethra was found to pass into the tumor. Following the natural cavity of the bladder by a probe, a section was carried through from the ure- thra,, along the anterior surface to the fundus vesicae; this section included a portion of the dis- ease, which consisted of a secretion of soft white pulpy matter, into what appeared to have been ori- ginally the cellular membrane connecting the coats of the bladder. The continued pressure and the operation of the disease had given the cellular mem- brane the appearance of fine ligamentous fasciculi passing in various directions, while the mode in which the albuminous matter had been deposited, the secretion having been principally carried for-

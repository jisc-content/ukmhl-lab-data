187 AFFECTIONS OF THE HEART. upon the surface of a peculiar disease of the lungs.* In the present case the capsules were thinner, whiter, more tough, and more opaque, than they were in the instance to which I have referred y and it seems extremely probable that this difference in appearance, was dependant upon the difierence in the date of their formation previous to death; and if this be true they may, perhaps, be considered as affording an explanation of one mode in which hydatids may be generated in the various cavities, or solid structures of the body. As to the principle on which the enlargement of the heart took place in the above case, 1 look upon it to be no other than that which obliges the mus- cular coat of the bladder to become thicker, when obstructed in the performance of its functions, it acquires additional strength. The first effect of the inflammation was probably the adhesion be- tween the heart and its capsule; which adhesion, once established, became a perpetual hindrance to the complete relaxation, and almost totally pre- vented the possibility of a perfect contraction of the cavities of that organ. The action of the heart must in this state have been constantly laborious and fatiguing to itself; and the repeated expres- sions of the patient as to his own feelings, afford a strong argument, that, however inconsiderable the nerves of the heart may be, they nevertheless, do sometimes transmit impressions as accurately as any other nerves in the body. * See Case 6i.

This had been consequent to a very ex- tensive effusion of coagulable lymph into the ca- vity of the abdomen, in which was alio a quantity of serous fluid, that was removed in the course of the examination. This mass of coagulable lymph was next cut into, when a quantity of brownish red fluid gushed forth, and with it the skins of some raisins. This circumstance proved that some part of the coats of the intestines had given way. The incision was then extended, so as to expose more perfectly the cavity of this preternatural cyst; by this means a circular hole, about a quarter of an inch in diameter, was discovered in the side of the small intestine. From this, the contents of the bowels had in the first instance escaped, and by it the fluids still ran freely out.

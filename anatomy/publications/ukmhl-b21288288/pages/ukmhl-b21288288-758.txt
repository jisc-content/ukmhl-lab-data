The canula being then in the least degree retracted, while the stilet is pressed forward, places the instrument at once in a fit state for making the puncture j keeping in view the line of direction tending to the centre of the distended bladder, the trocar is now to be ^ steadily passed forward through the coats of the intestine and bladder, when the stilet being care- fully withdrawn, the canula must be retained, and the urine allowed to pass off. As the accidental slipping of the canula out of the orifice in the bladder has been productive of inconvenience from the premature healing of the wound, and the consequent necessity for making a fresh puncture, it is desirable to have a little plate attached to the external part of the canula, 8

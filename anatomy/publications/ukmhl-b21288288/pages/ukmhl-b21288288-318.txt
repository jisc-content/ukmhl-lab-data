Fearing she might be worse, she returned home early, but on her way was seized with so violent a pain in the left side of the abdomen, that she was scarcely able either to walk or breathe. With dif- ficulty she got home, went to bed, was seized with vomiting, and threw off the contents of her stomach. The pain in the back and stomach continued for a week, the sickness returning frequently. For several days she had also had a looseness and purging.

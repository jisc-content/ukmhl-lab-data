ON HJEMORRHOIDAL DISEASES. X 4i turned out, and the parts were immediately re- lieved. The hsemorrhoidal tumor above described, I ap- prehend to be the most common form of the dis- ease. Where,^ from other circumstances, the health becomes permanently impaired, these sv^rellings may remain for many years, perfectly indolent, and productive of no inconvenience. But in gene- ral it is otherwise, and whenever a certain state of plethora is established, the capillary haemorrhoidal vessels pour out more blood into the cellular tex- ture ; the pain and irritation of the attack are pro- portioned to the distention from the effused fluid, and the swelling may, dependent on the constitu- tion and management of the patient, either cease to increase after a time, or go on enlarging till the skin at length gives way, and with the bleeding the pain and other symptoms subside. There are two methods of removing this kind of tumor, the one is by the knife, the other by liga- ture. There seems to be good ground for prefer- ing the latter mode of operating. Many patients are not able to overcome the alarm they feel at the idea of cutting, none of which attaches to the mere tying of a tumor. As relates to the surgeon, a stronger reason presents itself, in the superior safety of the ligature, compared with the knife. The haemorrhage, after excision, is sometimes very alarming, and has repeatedly proved fatal. In both modes of operating the removal of the disease is effected with equal certainty, provided the opera- tion is properly performed.

ON PAINFUL AFFECTIONS 76 had been thrown out, forming small flocculent patches. Within the ventricles there was about an ounce of effused serum, mingled with a yellow purulent matter, and shreds of coagulable lymph. On examination, the lateral and inferior parts of the surface of the cerebrum were found to exhibit the same appearances, noticed on the superior part of the brain. Upon raising the cerebellum and medulla ob- longata, the anterior surface of the latter was so loaded with effused lymph and purulent matter, that the basillary artery, for the space of an inch, was quite enveloped and hid from the view. This effusion was in appearance, the same v/ith that poured out upon the upper parts of the brain, and seemed to be principally deposited in the cellular space between the arachnoid membrane and pia mater. By examining a section of the medulla spinalis, divided as low down as possible from the cavity of the cranium, the inflammation of the membranes of the medulla, and the consequent effusion- were found to have taken place there to at least the same extent as higher up. From the appearances on dissection, therefore, considered with the symp- toms preceding death, I have not the least doubt that the inflammation and its consequences, had extended down the principal part of the theca vertebralis, if not the whole of it. Unfortunately, however, circumstances prevented the further pro- secution of this part of the dissection. In the chest, there was no trace of disease; and

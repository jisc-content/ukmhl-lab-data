That the inflammation, and its specific consequence, a pus- tular eruption, may occasionally take place in the pharynx, and even further down, is demonstrably estabUshed by an injected preparation * from a patient who died in the small-pox, which exhibits numerous pustules distinctly formed upon the inner membrane of the pharynx, and for more than half the length of the oesophagus. But on the other hand, while at Scarborough in December, 1808,1 had an opportunity of examining the state of these parts, in an adult, one of the pri- vates in the 82d regiment, who died of confluent small-pox. The pharynx and oesophagus were cer- tainly much inflamed, as was the stomach, and more or less, the whole of the intestines; but after the most diligent search, no trace whatever of the pus- tular action was found, either in the pharynx, oeso- phagus, stomach, or intestines. Of the permanent stricture of the oesophagus, I have only seen one instance. It occurred while I was pupil at St. George's Hospital, in the year 1799.

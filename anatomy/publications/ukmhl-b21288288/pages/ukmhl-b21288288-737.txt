CONSEQUENCES OF STRICTURE. 195 urethra, thus producing an oedematous tumor either in some part of the perinaeum, or scrotum, or both. In this way the irritation of the urine effused into the cellular structure, usually excites a sloughing inflammation beneath the integuments, in the neighbourhood of the perinÂ£eum, and either abscess or mortification, according to the state of constitu- tion, is the result. Where matter forms readily and is soon let out, the complaint may now take a favorable turn ; and provided the patient's constitutional powers are not too much exhausted by what he has already gone through, the local irritation subsides to a certain degree; he finds his health improve, his appetite returns, and the sloughy cellular membrane sepa- rating the ulcerated parts contract, and all that ultimately remains may be one or more fistulous openings in the perinaeum, through which the urine is either partially or wholly evacuated. This ulceration of the urethra and the conse- quences derived from it can be prevented only by the timely relief of the stricture; when however the urine has once made its escape into the celhilar membrane, producing inflammation and abscess, > even the removal of the obstruction in the urethra will not always succeed, in reheving the complaints that have been derived from it.

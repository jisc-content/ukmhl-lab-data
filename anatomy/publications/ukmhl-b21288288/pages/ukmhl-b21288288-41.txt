EXTERNAL TO THE BRAIN. man, fifty-nine years of age, who had a most ex- traordinary tumor" upon each side of his face, the progressive growth of which had been the means of his losing both his eyes. The following is the history of the complaint. About fourteen years back he was apparently in perfect health, and was walking up HampsteadHill, on a windy day. On the road he was suddenly at- tacked with a violent itching and heat in both his eyes. The violence of the itching induced him to rub them most vehemently. Before he could reach home the irritation had increased to that degree that he was unable to open his eyes in the light. Inflam- mation supervened, and a small tumor formed just below the inner angle of each eye, about the size of a hazel nut. These swelHngs, to use his own words, " burst inwardly," discharging afterwards freely between the eyelids. The inflammation treated by fomentations, with poppy heads, and medi- cines occasionally, went on for about twelve weeks. It had then so far subsided that he could open his eyes, bear the light tolerably well, and look about him. He soon after recovered, and went to his work again. About a fortnight after this, being out, he took a fresh cold ; having been exposed all night to cold and rain, in the winter season. On this occasion he applied to an eminent ocu- list *, who ordered him to lay a warm poultice over each eye, as the swellings were again returning on * Mr. Ware.

AFFECTIONS OF THE BRAIN 58 the rupture in the septum lucidum. Within the left lateral ventricle, a larger quantity of serous contents, and a larger proportion of red blood were found, than had been observed in the right. The plexus choroides had the same appearance in this, as in the other ventricle. The fluid having been allowed to run off, the left corpus striatum appeared very tumid and much darker in its colour than natural. In two points it was lacerated, and small coagula of blood were found entangled in the openings. The striated substance of this part of the brain was then dissected away; and beneath, very near its surface, was found a large mass of coagulated blood. The quantity of this extravasation was at least equal to four ounces, the whole of which had been effiised into the medullary substance of the brain; extending itself into the anterior and posterior lobes of the left hemisphere of the cere- brum. The internal carotid arteries were in some parts becoming opaque, although they were not found ossified. The present state of our knowledge has ascer- tained, that the offices and uses of the medulla oblongata and the medulla spinalis are of so essen- tial a nature, that although the superior parts of the brain will endure pressure to a considerable extent, the medulla oblongata, or medulla spinalis, cannot, in general, bear the least intrusion into the space set apart for them; for an extravasation of blood, even to the smallest possible extent, has

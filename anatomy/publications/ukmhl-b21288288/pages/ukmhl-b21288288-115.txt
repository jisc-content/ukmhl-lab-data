OF THE BRAIN. 99 Case 29. Circumsnihed Liflammation and Adhesion^ between the Brain and its Membranes^ terminating fatally. Captain F. T. of the 82d Regiment of Foot, a gentleman 28 years of age, had been for several years subject to an haemorrhoidal complaint; and from this cause had frequently experienced loss of blood.

They usually required a reclining posture for half an hour after having passed a motion, but were subsequently reduced, and gave no further trouble till the next day.

In a moment his features became altered, and his breathing attended with a most unnatural sound. At the first glance his brother officer concluded lie was joking, and continued reading, but in a few seconds more he fell into a state of universal con- vulsion, with which, in an instant, he was thrown from his chair. The attack however, was latterly rigid spasm, rather than violent convulsion. II 2

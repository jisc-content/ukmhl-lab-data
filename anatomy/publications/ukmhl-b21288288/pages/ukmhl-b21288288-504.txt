ON DISLOCATION. down to their insertion upon the lesser trochanter of the thigh bone; this depression being the result of increased pressure, from the proper line of muscular action being changed, must be more or less strongly marked in proportion to the degree of deviation in the line of muscular contraction; but m the present case, this appearance is scarcely at all perceptible. A considerable deposit of ossific matter has taken place, and the appearance of the structure of the new bone, affords an additional evidence of the true seat of this ossific secretion, as well as of the simi- larity in structure, between the capsular ligaments of the joints, and the periosteum of the bones. The porous appearance of the surface of the newly formed bone, might be at first mistaken for a caries, but it arises merely from the nature of the structure within which the ossific matter is deposited, for the openings upon the surface, when examined with sufficient attention, will appear to be what the inspection of the parts in their recent state prove them to be, the passages necessary for the transmission of blood-vessels and fibres, which still connect the separated laminse of the mem- branous capsule together, while the ossific fabric still remains, in some degree immature *. * Plate 7.

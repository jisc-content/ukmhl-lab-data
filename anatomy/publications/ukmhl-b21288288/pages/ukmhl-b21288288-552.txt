10 IRRITATION AND ABSCESS Here then, we come to inflammation either partial or general of the kidney, an affection which is fre- quently brought on in consequence of irritation from gravel; in which case the symptoms that at- tend inflammation from any other cause will be present, and require a treatment regulated accord- ing to the same principles. Should the irritation have been long continued, the increased mucous secretion from the internal parts of the kidney, may by an insensible change take on all the characters of purulent matter, with- out any part of the secreting surface having ulce- rated ; at least I have in several cases seen such fluid passed with the urine, and after death found the kidney and ureter loaded with pus, although when the parts were clean washed, the inner mem- brane lining the pelvis and infundibula was per- fectly free from any appearance of ulceration. Where inflammation of the kidney has proceeded to form abscess, the purulent contents may escape by bursting into the pelvis of the kidney, and flow off" by the ureter with the urine, and this of all others is the most desirable mode of getting rid of it. Frequently, however, things take a less favour- able turn, and the ulcerative process extends itself in some other direction, in which event the imme- diate seat of the disease is still relieved from its load, but the obtaining this relief is an effort of nature which very rarely terminates well.

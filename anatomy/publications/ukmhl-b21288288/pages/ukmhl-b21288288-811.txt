EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. ^61 s 3 PLATE IV. Exhibits a striking example of complicated and extensive disease of the urethra, bladder, and pros- tate gland, not excepting even the rectum; the whole derived in the first instance from the throw- ing up of an injection, to cure a gonorrhea.* a. The orifice of the urethra, aiid the glans penis, upon the surface of which may be observed the depres- sions left by the chancres. h. The commencement of the strictui'e that was the immediate consequence of inflammation of the ure- thra. c. The termination of this contracted part, the extent of which is about two inches and a half. d. A very fine silver probe that was with difficulty passed through a fii'm and closely contracted stric- ture at the bulb of the urethra, and making its appearance behind the stricture through the di\dded parts at, e. Where the canal might have been brought more into view but for this objection, that the whole of the dis- ease could not in any way be distinctly seen at once, and consecjuently the other appearances preserved upon the figure would have been partially sacrificed by any further prosecution of the dissection. f. The urinary bladder; its parietes excessively thick- ened from habitual labour, and its cavity rendered smaller in the same proportion. â– * See Case i8.

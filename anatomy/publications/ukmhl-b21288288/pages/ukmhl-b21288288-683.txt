SECRETION FROM THE GLAND. I'*!' becomes more tenacious and ropy than it is in its healthy state, the urine in which it is contained throwing ofF an ofFensive odour and passing readily into a state of putrefaction. Should the enlargement of the prostate gland have proceeded to such an extent as to create a consider- able difficulty in the expulsion of the urine, the coats of the bladder having preternatural difficulties to overcome, are under the necessity of making greater exertions than before, and the muscular coat in con- sequence of this exertion acquires a considerable increase of strength and thickness, while the cavity of the bladder is in the same proportion diminished, similar to what happens in stricture in the urethra. When however, the circumstances of the case are complicated, and in addition to the enlargement of the prostate gland there is irritability at the neck of the bladder, the frequent straining to expel the urine aggravates the whole of the symptoms, until at length a violent degree of inflammation of the mucous membrane of the bladder takes place, the extreme excitement of which becomes in its turn a new cause of spasmodic eflbrts to contraction ; and these effi^rts, while on the one hand they induce a rapid increase of the disturbance and congestion in the prostate gland, rarely fail on the other in ex- tending the inflammatory action from the mucous membrane to the muscular coat of the bladder, a circumstance that usually ends in a consolidation of

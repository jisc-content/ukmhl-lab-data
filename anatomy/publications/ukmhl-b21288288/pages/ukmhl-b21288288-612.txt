Sabulous and mucous mat- ter, with particles of stone are occasionally voided with the urine, and from the increasing severity of irritation, the urine acquires a highly offensive, alkalescent, or putrid odour. The constitution at length sympathises with the local irritation, and the constant thirst, heat, declension of strength, and loss of appetite all assist in hurrying on the disease to a fatal termination. There are few points more difficult in practical surgery, than the deciding positively upon the ex- istence of a stone in the bladder, unless the cal- culus has been distinctly felt by an instrument introduced into the bladder for that purpose. All the symptoms of stone are more or less equivocal, but some of them are exceedingly so.

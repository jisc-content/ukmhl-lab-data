AND ITS MEMBRANES. I believe, been very rarely observed. It had taken place very universally, and the effusion seemed not only to have arisen from the capillary arteries upon the external surface of the pia mater, but also from those processes of the membrane that dip down between the convolutions forming the to- mentum cerebri. Several of these deeper-seated coagula were divided with the knife in the course of the dissection. i • i • The particular extravasation, however, which m all probability had been the immediate cause of death, was distinct from the appearance just de- scribed. Paring away the superior portion of the right anterior lobe cerebri, a coagulum was found deposited in the central part of the medulla. Here a vessel had ruptured, and had poured out nearly an ounce of blood. The medullary coagulum was found in a gelatinous and almost fluid state, but the pia matral extravasation was in every part of a more dense, firm, and dry consistence. The apo- plectic coagulum within the brain is comparatively common, but this peculiar and general affection of the capillary arteries of the pia mater, is, I be- lieve, a very uncommon consequence of diseased action in the vessels in the brain.

A lady about the turn of life, whom I have attended repeatedly, and who has for many years back been severely afflicted with gout, has within these three years experienced, on several occasions, most alarming pains in her head. These have never occurred but at the periods when the gout was flying about, and manifestly operating in the constitution. The disease, as usual, was in this case for many years confined entirely to the foot, but of late the immense discharges of chalk and purulent matter from the feet, have proved insuf- ficient to allay the severity of the attack, which alternately has affected the joints of the feet and hands, the muscular parietes of the chest, the lungs, the stomach, and the brain, producing almost always the symptoms indicating inflammatory ac- tion.

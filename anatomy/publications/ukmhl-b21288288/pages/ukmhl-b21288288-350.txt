The continuance of beat and tumor required poultice and fomentation for near a fortnight, when suppuration being established, they were laid aside, and dressings of cerat. lap. calam. substituted. They seemed to agree with it very well, and by November 20th, the wound was almost Jiealed. Still however the disease returned; for only a fortnight after the last operation, two small tubercles had been felt no larger than peas, forming within the lower part of the remaining portion of the scrotum, and still more recently a tumor had made its appearance in the cellular membrane under the integuments of the crest of the pubes; the latter of these swellings occupying a situation as distinct as possible from the original seat of the disease. These tumors continued to enlarge till they had reached the size of hen's eggs, when they became stationary, but from their* general progress, and particularly from the appearance of that over the pubes, which was assuming a livid colour peculiar to the disease, preparatory to its ulcerating and throwing up fungus, it was pretty clear these changes would have followed, but for the other parts of the disease now taking the lead.

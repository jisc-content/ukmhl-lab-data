STOMACH AND INTESTINAL CANAL. T 2 the opening in the integuments, she became easier. In this way, faecal matter collected and discharged three or four times a day. The stools per anum were in general relaxed, for she preferred a light and almost liquid diet. She experienced no pain in going to stool, nor any particular uneasiness from the passage of the matter by the ulcerated opening. Her water pass- ed freely, and without pain. As soon as the tumor broke, a poultice of bread and milk was applied, and the second day after- ward a long round worm came away with the applications. Before it broke, she was sensible of the wind being pent up, and rumbling about within the tumor, but she never felt any sensation of this nature after it had opened. The discharge con- tinued to .flow till the middle of the following August, during which time her diet was various. The dressings were merely those most convenient for keeping her sweet and clean. Her stomach, however, at. last grew very weak, and her general strength declining with it, she went off by degrees, and on the twenty-ninth of the month she died, completely worn out by debility. Examination. On examination of the body, the integuments round the external opening of the ulcer were found separated from the parts beneath, to some distance. The cellular membrane was destroyed by ulceration, and the fibre's of the abdominal muscles were as clean as if prepared by dissection.

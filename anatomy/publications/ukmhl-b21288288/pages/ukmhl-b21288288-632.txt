90 APPEARANCES AND STRUCTURE, &C. colour, with a smooth, and frequently a crystalline surface. There are some that consist of oxalate of lime, and these are easily known by the protuber- ances and inequalities upon the surface, whence they have received the name of mulberry calculi; in their superior compactness and weight, and in their darker colour, they differ from the other kinds of urinary concretions. When a calculus is carefully divided with a fine saw, the exact arrangement of its internal structure is at once exhibited. The central part or nucleus is in the majority of cases Ibund to be uric acid, the surrounding laminae being made up of the phos- phates, either intimately combined, or alternately disposed, although occasionally the uric acid, and the phosphates, are laid in succession throughout the whole bulk of the calculus, but in this case the uric acid is usually found in less abundance than the other constituents.

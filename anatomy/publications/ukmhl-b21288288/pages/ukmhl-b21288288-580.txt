38 RENAL CALCULUS VOIDED WITH THE URINE. limbs. The attack was repeatedly productive of the ^ most urgent and fatiguing tenesmus, with constant desire to pass his water, although neither his stools nor urine were voided without extreme pain. During the intervals that occurred, although suf- ficiently recovered to be capable of looking after his business, he very rarely felt as if in perfect health, generally finding a certain degree of in- ternal obstruction in his own idea, preventing the free passage of the water. About five months subsequent to his first attack, Avhen extremely ill, he was ordered a pill, containing two grains of opium, at noon ; it lulled the pain, and he got sleep. In the evening he took a second pill as before. During the night he slept well, and in the morning he arose refreshed and free from all un- easiness. Judging from his own feelings, he now considered himself quite recovered. Towards evening however, in making water, he felt something come suddenly into the passage, in- stantly obstructing the flow of urine. It gave great pain, and brought on the most excessive straining, which continued until at length the cause of the ob- struction was shot out from the orifice of the urethra, when the water again flowed as freely as ever. On examining the chamber-vase it proved to be a small rounded calculus of uric acid, about the size of a pea, which in all probability had been during the whole of the period of his ill health making its way through the ureter. /

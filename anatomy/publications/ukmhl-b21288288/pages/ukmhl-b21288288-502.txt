4-78 ON DISLOCAtlON My attention was first ]ed to the consideration of this subject, by the repeated examination of a con- siderable number of preparations,* that afford a very beautiful and complete series of illustrations. With a view to set the appearances of tliese spe- cimens in as distinct a point of view as possible, I have made drawings from some of them, selecting those which exhibited the clearest characters. In all these preparations, the dislocation took place in the same direction, the head of the bone passing upward and backward. ^ In the first case, the head of the femur, judging from the figure of the acetabulum, and from the defined line in which the dislocated head of the bone had obviously ranged upon the ilium, remain- ed attached to its proper cavity by the round liga- ment, although I should be disposed to beheve the capsular ligament was ruptured. The appearances upon the bone are such as seem to me attributable to the constant friction of the smooth head of the femur upon the periosteum of the ilium, exciting absorption only. In the second case, the luxation apparently took place under the same circumstances with the first, the round ligament only remaining entire. In ad- dition to the deep impression upon the external " sis praecipue fuerat appressum, non aequalis, sed aspera, fora- " minulenta, et quasi cariosa erat; reliqua pars, ad quam margo " rotundulus, et inferior capitis dicti accesserat, aequabilior erat."

OF THE BRAIN. 1^9 the affection to be confined entirely to the cellular membrane external to the skull, while the con- tents of the cranium have not exhibited any parti- cular marks of congestion. Now and then a degree of coagulation takes place at the marginal basis of this description of tumor, the result of which is a very deceptive kind of feel. The ambiguity arising from this circum- stance has, on examination, occasionally led to the opinion that a part of the cranium was deficient* The marginal line whence the tumefaction is dif- fused, is readily mistaken for the boundary of the ossific surface, and the softer space within, which may be apparently more depressed also, has very much the feel of the yielding membranes of the brain. * Where, however, a part of the cranium is defi- cient, the pulsations of the brain will be readily distinguishable, which will not be the case in ex- travasated fluid lying upon the skull j and this circumstance it may be well to keep in mind, as it is always desirable to be able to give a clear and accurate opinion, although with regard to the pre- cise distinction between defect of bone, and effusion of flu^d, the diagnosis is of no serious im- portance, as the active hand of surgery is not required in either case; gentle frictions, and spiritous embrocations being all that is necessary in the way of treatment. * I have repeatedly found the same deceptive sensation oc- cur in examining an extravasation beneath the scalp, from ex- ternal violence.

He had remained four days in the hospital, with- out experiencing any relief, when he was ordered to rub in two drachms of mercurial ointment upon the inside of the thighs, and this was repeated every evening for five successive nights, when the quan- tity was diminished to one drachm, which was continued for six evenings more; he was then ordered to desist, as I found the mouth was be- coming affected. While the frictions were carrying on, his com- plaints did not give way in any remarkable degree; but immediately the constitution was brought fairly under the mercurial influence, the pain in the tumor, and every other symptom with it, began to decline. The excitement remained upon the system for about a week, when he found himself so much relieved, that he said he felt no pain, or tender- ness whatever, nor any remaining heat in the tumor. He now slept soundly through the night, all constitutional sympathy having entirely left him. The peculiar feel of hardness also was gone, and what remained of the local affection com- pletely disappeared in the course of the following fortnight. He was allowed to return to his duty, after remaining three weeks in the hospital.

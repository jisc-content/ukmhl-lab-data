468 ON DISLOCATION course be regulated by that of the membrane car- rying the vessels which furnish the secretion. Thus, we see that the two opposite processes of absorption and deposition of bone are set up, and move on hand in hand, in perfect unison with each other, to the attainment of one and the same end, the re-establishment of an extended surface of articulation for a dislocated bone, with a view to the muscles recovering their original power of moving the joint. From a preparation, * that affords a most beau- tiful illustration of the foregoing observations, an engraving has been made. In this instance the humerus, partially dislocated forwards, and re- strained by the capsule of the joint, eventually re- covered a sufficiently extended surface of contact to allow considerable motion between the bones, by the establishment of a species of double articu- lation. The surface of the head of the humerus divided into two by a deep notch, moved â€¢ at one part upon a portion of the original glenoid cavity, and at the other upon a new surface of articulation, produced from the anterior margin of the neck of the scapula, by an adequate deposit of ossific matter, t * In Mr. Heaviside's Museum. f Plate 6.

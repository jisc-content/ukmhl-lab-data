Where however this ex- pedient fails, that which began with irritation go- ing on to violent inflammation, lymph is effused, which opposes in general an effectual barrier to any farther injury; but where the disposition, or power, in the constitution to throw out coagulable lymph is weak, this last effort turns out no more success- ful than those that had preceded it, and the irritation continuing still to increase, goes on eventually to the estabhshment of fatal disease in the coats of the bladder. Where the excitement has prevailed at particular points only, producing a free effusion of lymph, ca- pable of answering the intention held in view, the appearances may be confined to a number of circum- scribed patches of coagulable lymph, each sur- rounded by an inflamed circle, and covered upon the surface with adherent calculous matter; but where the same effort is made in a constitution pos- sessing more irritability, with less strength, the irri- tation still continuing to operate, gives rise to cir- cumscribed spots, at which the diseased coats of the bladder eventually throw up a weak irritable vascu- lar fungus, projecting into the cavity, much disposed to bleed from the slightest cause, and possessing, in this respect as well as others, the characters belong- 11

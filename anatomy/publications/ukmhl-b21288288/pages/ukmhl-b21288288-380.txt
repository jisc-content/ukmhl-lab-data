In a child two months old, whom I was desired to see, coagulable lymph had been thrown out, and it had become organized and vascular. The only opening that remained for the passage of the urine, was in this instance, as in that above de- scribed, at the inferior angle of the vagina. In the present instance, the adhesion had taken place while the infant was at M^et nurse, and might readily have been prevented by a due attention to cleanliness. The separation of the parts only re- quired the introduction of a strong probe by the little opening, the instrument being brought out by effecting a gradual separation of the recently formed adhesions.

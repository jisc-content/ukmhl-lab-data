AFFECTIONS OF THE LUNGS. on the left side, and pressing upon the heart. These tumors formed a part of a large congeries, and were beautifully vascular upon that part of their surface covered by the pericardium. Nearly the whole of the left side of the chest was filled with an undulating tumor, evidently con- nected with that which had pushed the diaphragm downwards into the cavity of the abdomen; but the whole of the contents of this side of the chest were" so firmly adherent every where; that it was with difficulty that the situation of each part was made out. A small contracted lobe of the lungs, perfectly healthy in its appearance and structure was found lying upon the anterior part of the left side of the chest, but it was so covered up in strong adhesions, that it was only perceived by its colour, in making a section through the part. By making an opening into that part of the fluc- tuating tumor in the chest from which the ster- .num had been separated, what seemed to be only a mass of condensed membranous adhesions was cut through, when a stream of greenish yellow, thick, purulent matter, of a very offensive odour, issued forth. At first this was removed with a sponge, but as it soon appeared that this was doing nothing, the opening was freely enlarged, and with the assist- ance of a tumbler glass, as much as six quarts of purulent fluid were removed before the cyst could be said to be empty. At the upper part of the chest, surrounded by adhesions, was the large mass of a tuberculated dis- ease, apart of which, as before stated, had pressed

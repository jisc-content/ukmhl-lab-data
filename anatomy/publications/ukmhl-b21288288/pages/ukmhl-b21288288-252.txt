-34 ON SOME AFFECTION'S be satisfactory, but certainly not so in others. It is extremely difficult to decide in what diseases in- flammation may, and in what it may not, bear a part. In the acute affections, however, of this viscus, the symptoms proper to inflammation will generally point out its existence ; and even in those chronic diseases, where the more evident symptoms of inflammation have never taken place, I should myself suspect, that in the first instance, the due balance of the healthy circulation must have suf- fered some degree of disturbance or excitement, although perhaps, for a short time only, and with- out assuming any well marked character. The liver, like the other viscera of the body, having its own peculiar functions to perform, and possessing its own peculiar structure, has also a par- ticular measure of irritability assigned to itj in which respect it differs from other parts, as much as it does in its functions. The structure of the liver is parenchymatous, and it is sparingly furnished with nerves. It is also very frugally supplied with arterial blood. But its functions in the system require that a large pro- portion of the circulating fluids should be constantly flowing through the vessels of the liver, in the form of venous blood; and hence, perhaps, may be derived some explanation of its peculiar habits, under the influence of disease. When on foreign service with the army, I have repeatedly found after death, inflammation and abscess of the liver, while the troops were under canvas; which appearances were most probably

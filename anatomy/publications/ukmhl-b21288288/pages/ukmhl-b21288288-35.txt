EXTERNAL TO THE BRAIN. C 3 second opening now formed within the mouth, between the cheek and jaw, affording a very free discharge for the matter. Obhged to attend his master into the country, he laid aside the poultice, substituting a plaster of soap cerate, covered with a piece of flannel. The discharge gradually decreased, and several small fragments of carious bone worked out into the mouth. It was several months before he returned to town, soon after which, he found a much larger piece of bone had separated, and was protruding upwards through the gum, between the cheek and the jaw. When sufficiently loosened he disengaged it, and brought it away. From this time he improved rapidly, the abscess contracted and healed, and he entirely recovered. On examining the jaw some months afterward, the surface of the bone between the cheek and the gum was firm and smooth. On the outside of the jaw the part from which the piece had separated, was formed into a superficial convexity, from the ossific action having more than repaired the loss of bone. * * Plate 2.

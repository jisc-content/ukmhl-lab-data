Within the ventricles there was a very small accumulation of fluid; to explain the coma and convulsion, which had latterly existed, it seemed necessary to take into account the general conges- tion in the vascular system of the brain. The structure of the brain was examined through- out, without any other appearance of disease being found. I have attended to, and dissected, one instance of pure hydrocephalus externus in an adult, that took place at the close of a tedious and distressing case of hip disease. It appeared to establish itself, on this occasion, very suddenly indeed, for the first circumstance that could lead to a suspicion of its presence, was the patient being seized with a fit of convulsion. Indeed, even after the convul- sion had supervened, in the intervals of sensibility, the patient assured me that he had no pain what* ever, in his headj nothing beyond a sense of lightness, and an uncomfortable feel.

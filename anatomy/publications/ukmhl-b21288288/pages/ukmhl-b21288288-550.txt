O CALCULOUS AFFECTIONS See Case 4, enough found, but there was no remaining trace whatever of the ureter, although the celhilar mem- brane ana peritoneum in which it is commonly situated were dissected with care, a circumstance which afforded a strong argument that the healthy action of the kidney must have ceased long before. Where a small calculus has formed in the kidney, the most desirable event is its passage by the ureter down into the bladder; particularly if the figure of the stone is such as to admit of its subsequent escape by the urethra. The symptoms that attend this event are generally sufficiently well marked to point out the nature of the complaint, provided the affection is not complicated with disease of any other kind. * The secretion of calculous matter may be rea- sonably expected to produce at least some disturb- ance within the cavities of the kidney, by irritating the tender membranous surfaces. We see that while the urine deposits gravel at the bottom of the vessel, a thick cloud of dense mucous matter most frequently demonstrates the state of excitement in which the mucous cavities of the kidney are placed. The increased secretion of mucus, in these cases, may be regarded as an effort on the part of the constitution, to defend the surfaces of the mem- branes from the contact and irritation of the cal-

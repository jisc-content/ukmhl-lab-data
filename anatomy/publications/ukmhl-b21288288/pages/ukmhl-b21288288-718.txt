176 DISEASED PROSTATE GLAND a large abscess within the substance of the prostate gland. The bladder, on its posterior part, was then laid * open, by a longitudinal section. By this means a small abscess was accidentally discovered, full of thick purulent matter; it was situated between the peri- toneal and muscular coats, at the fundus of the bladder. The coats of the bladder were extremely thicken- ed, its cavity very much diminished, and its inner membrane of a lurid colour, and highly vascular. The abscess in the prostate gland contained a thick brownish yellow matter. Some parts of this abscess had assumed a fungated appearance, while in others the parietes had formed little recesses, in which were lodged a considerable number of small rounded calculi. Some of these calculi were of a dark brown colour, but others, when allowed to dry, assumed the colour and polished appearance of small pearls. Between the stricture at the bulb, and the neck of the bladder, several fistulous openings were found, leading out from the urethra j some of these canals being connected with the abscess in the prostate gland and consequently with the opening into the rectum, and others communicating with the fistu- lous passages in perinseo. * * See the Diseased Parts.

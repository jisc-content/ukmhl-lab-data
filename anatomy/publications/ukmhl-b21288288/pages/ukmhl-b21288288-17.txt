EXTERNAL TO THE BRAIN. s On examination the tumor proved to be a strong cartilaginous cyst, seated in the cellular membrane beneath the scalp. The cavity of the cyst was filled with a yellow purulent fluid; the thicker parts of which had formed a curdly deposit upon the sides of the cavity.* The patient had not lost above an ounce of blood in the operation, but he rather unexpectedly felt his head better the following evening, than for many months before. He found his uneasiness and pain in the head continue to diminish from day to day, and he stated, with some degree of surprise, that he also found his sight becoming much stronger, and clearer than before. By the time the wound was healed, he had quite lost all remains of pain in his head, and his sight was so greatly improved, that he was now again able to read the same small printed book that he had been in the habit of using ten years before; nor did either the pains in the head, or the affection of the sight afterwards return. There needs no stronger argument in proof of the necessity for attending to cases in Surgery, than the difficulty frequently experienced in ac- counting for symptoms. * Plate 1. Fig. 1.

EXTERNAL TO THE BRAIN. When however, encysted tumors make their ap- pearance independant of external injury, the ex- citing cause must be sought for in the particular state of the constitution. This state would appear to consist in a peculiar disposition to local increase of vascular action, extending itself to a certain de- gree^ and to that degree only, and determining it- self to some certain point beneath the integuments, so that it may, in this respect, be considered as ana- logous to other local increased actions, which de- termine to the surface of the skin, producing vari- ous circumscribed, or pustular eruptions. Suppose the constitution previously impaired, by hard work, hard drinking, ill treatment, or origi- nally bad health, the successive steps of the above process will of necessity be interrupted, and other consequences will take place. The relaxed exhalents fail in tlie attempt to pour out coagulable lymph only, they effuse pus, and this effusion gives rise to a tumor more diffused, and much more quickly formed than the other, being attended with charac- ters of more decidedly inflammatory action than the former case. Both kinds of tumor however seem to agree in this particular, that the disposition which gives rise to them may occasionally settle it- self upon several points at the same time. Any accidental increase in vascular action, which in perfect health would have produced phlegmonous inflammation, will in this state of habit exhibit more or less distinctly the appearances of erysipelas, and ^ require for its cure such constitutional treatment, jj 3

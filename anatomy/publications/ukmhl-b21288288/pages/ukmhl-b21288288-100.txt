84 ON THE AFFECTIONS whole of the cerebrum was converted into an im- mense cyst, the parietes of which were in the thickest parts about three quarters, and in tlie thin- nest three-eighths of an inch in tliickness. The cere- bellum was flattened by the pressure from above, and was consequently broader and thinner than natural.* * Plate 3. Fig. 1. Exhibits the exact apppearance of the brain, taken subsequent to its immersion in spirit, although re- presented on a very reduced scale, a a a. The lacerated edges of the thin medullary expansion, looking like an hydatid, which, on laying back the dura mater, occupied in some measure the place of the corpus callosum, and was all that remained of that part of the brain, exceedingly expanded, and by the pressure of the subjacent fluid raised nearly to a level with the surface of the cerebrum. h. The anterior part of the brain. c c. The posterior lobes cerebri. The whole external sur- face of the brain had its convolutions exceedingly flattened, and in some parts nearly obliterated. d d. The depressions within the general cavity, answering to the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles, or to the anterior lobes cerebri. e e. Two other depressions, answering to the middle cor- nua of the lateral ventricles, or to the middle lobes cerebri; between which is seen what appears to be the remains of the third ventricle. Upon the inter- nal surface, several ramifying veins are just percep- tible from the dark blood shining through the thin medullary stratum forming the basis of the -general cavity. yjl The comparatively deep depressions answering to thÂ© posterior cornua of the lateral ventricles, or the pos- terior lobes cerebri.

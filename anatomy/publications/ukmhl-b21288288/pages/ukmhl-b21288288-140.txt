ON THE AFFECTIONS 124 exert a powerful influence in bringing on local con> gestion^; noticing the ambiguity which in some of these cases will puzzle and embarrass the prac- titioner, unless he has previously attended closely to the subject; and then passing forward to the consideration of the most common effects of in- flammation, effusion, and adhesion, as affecting the functions of the brain. It may seem curious that the hydrocephalus in- ternus is the only species of dropsy productive of enlargement of the cranium. Water forming in the ventricles will, if the accumulation takes place slowly, go on for an immense length of time, and often produce a separation of all the bones of the skull, without its being attended with symptoms indicating any material disturbance to the func- tions of the brain; whereas water deposited be- tween the membranes upon the external surface of the brain may perhaps partially separate the arach- noid membrane from the pia mater, but will rarely if ever proceed further, before it proves fatal. But this may not be the consequence of the brain having less power to carry on its functions under an external, than an internal pressure â€¢ it may perhaps, rather be attributed to the general circulation of the blood through this organ being less extensively deranged in the one case, than it is in the other; at least so it appears to me. The proportion of blood circulated by the vas- cular membranes within the ventricles of the brain, compared with that conveyed by the pia mater covering the external parts of the brain, may be estimated as one part, to fifteen or twenty; conse-

The swelling below the eye-lids had latterly increased so fast, that the skin in parts, had, from absorption, become extremely thin, and would soon have given way. The swelling upon the temporal bone, as had been suspected from "its peculiar firm feel dur- ing life, was situated beneath the aponeurosis of the temporal muscle, the fleshy fibres of which, on subsequent examination, were to all appearance destroyed. To ascertain the contents of the largest of the tumors, without entirely destroying its texture, a lancet was passed into it, when the tense state of the fascia expelled a part of the contents, which was pulpy, and, although in some points of a whitish colour, it was principally of the consistence and appearance of dark coagulated blood. To determine further the state of the temporal bone upon which the tumor lay, a probe was introduced, but the bone was not to be felt in any direction, for the instrument passed in for at least half its length, as if into the substance of the brain. The superior part of the cranium next removed, the dura mater was laid aside, without any thing particular being observed; but on continuing the examination towards the basis of the cranium, a

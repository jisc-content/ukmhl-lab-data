In the animal economy it is invariably observed, that the more remote from the heart, the more weak is the impulse of the circulation, which en- sures the observance of the following important rule, that whenever the actions and powers of the machine are called forth to any preternatural exer- tion, the most effective energy is evinced nearest the heart; in other words that where mortification in a soft part, or necrosis in a bone, require removal, the operation by which this removal is effected, ul- ceration in the one case, absorption in the other, are sure of taking place at that point where alone separation cuts them off at once from every con- nection with the source of life. In the case just related we see this law produc- tive of a consequence strongly illustrative of the harmony that pervades all the operations of nature. The inflammatory action of the soft parts of the finger, extending itself to the cavity within the bone, the soft medullary contents converted into a highly vascular granulating structure, commenced an active absorption of the internal parts of the bone ; and as this action was progressive, a consider- able part of the cylinder of the bone was actually removed by absorption before the rest was ex- tracted ; and the absorbing power of the granulat- ing surface having been most actively engaged where the circulation received the most lively im- pulse, the articulated end next the hand was thus separated from the rest of the bone j the final re- E E

A degree of fluctuation was perceptible, towards the central part of the mass, which was surrounded by a con- siderable degree of circumscribed hardness. This tumor had always been of an indolent nature till latterly, when, from its becoming more uneasy than usual, she was induced to seek relief.

As an external application, a warm gum plaster was laid upon the part. It was worn for a few days, in which time the swelling became exceedingly painful, and in about a week more broke of itself.

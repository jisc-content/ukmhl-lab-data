AFFECTIONS OF THE LUNGS. 213 p 3 through the pericardium against the heart. The texture and appearance of this disease somewhat resembled brain, or even cream ; it was intersected with fine, membranous fasciculi. Cutting through a part of the mass, the knife passed at once into the large purulent cyst, and on careful examination of the section, it became clearly evident that the great cyst was in immediate connection with the tuber- culated disease, for the surface of contact between the sohd disease and the purulent fluid was soft as pap, and evidently acted upon by the contents of the cyst. The tuberculated disease was ascertained to reach as high as the superior margin of the chest, at the posterior part of which, most firmly adherent and closely contracted was found the large lobe of the left lung; it was situated in tlie angular space be- tween the ribs and spine. The whole substance of the lung was distinct from the disease, as proved demonstrably by the appearance of the sections of the parts. There were two small abscesses, about the size of hazel nuts, in the substance of the lung, and a third, which was as large as a chesnut; but the consistence of the matter in these abscesses, was as thick as butter, and in other respects, totally unlike to that found in the great cyst. On examining various parts of the internal sur- face of the large cyst, it appeared that its imme- diate parietes were a flocculent cellular substance, except where it lay in contact with the tuberculated disease within the chest.

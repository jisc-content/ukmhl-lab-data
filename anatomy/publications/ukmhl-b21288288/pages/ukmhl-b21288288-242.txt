( 224 ) CHAP. IV. ON THE DISEASES OF THE CONTENTS OF THE ABDOMEN. Sect. I. on some affections of the peritoneum. Case 67. Shigidar Disease of the Peritonam. In January 1815, I was requested to examine the body of a youth who had died at the age of seven- teen. He had been the apprentice of a respectable tradesman in the city; and from his master's account, it appeared that his disease had never been at all understood. For the last twelvemonth, he had been always weak and complaining, so that he had been of little use in the business ; and yet it was never made out satisfactorily where his disorder was seated. His constant complaint was of his " inside," but he had no cough, nor fixed pain in any particular part. About three months before his death, he was in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and was then consi- dered to be in a consumptive state. While there, he was blistered, blooded, purged, and even sali- vated ; without the least benefit to his disorder.

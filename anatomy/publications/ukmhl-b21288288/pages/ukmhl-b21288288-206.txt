ON SOME OF THE unequal; for on opening into the heart, the right ventricle and auricle appeared to be much about their natural size, and were moderately full of black blood ; but the left ventricle was so enlarged â‚¬is to exceed very much the size of the opposite side of the heart, while the left auricle was even larger than the ventricle. Within the left auricle and ventricle, there was at least a pound" of black, grumous blood. The parietes of the left side of the heart had acquired an additional degree of thick- ness and power, proportioned to the necessity for increased action. An examination of the valves led to the detec- tion of the principal, although I beHeve not the primary, seat of the disease. The auricular valve of the left ventricle had become thickened in its structure, and as- the thickness of the valve in- creased, its breadth fi'om the floating margin towards the basis of its insertion, had become di- minished, while its power of closing the opening into the auricle had also decreased, until latterly it was lost altogether, and the two cavities were consequently thrown into one. In the early progress of this disease, a part only of the blood received from the lungsi was at each contraction of the heart driven forward into the aorta, the remaining part escaping back into the auricle. But as the disease advanced, the pro- portion of blood thus driven forward was dimin- ished, while that which escaped by the imperfect action of the valve was augmented, until at length the blood within the heart was alternately driven

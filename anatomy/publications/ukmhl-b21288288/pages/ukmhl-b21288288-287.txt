The mass of coagulable lymph, which had united nearly all the viscera of the abdomen together, was in some places nearly a quarter of an inch in thickness. In the immediate neighbourhood of the ulcerated opening, this lymph had formed an kregular kind of cavity or cyst, a process by the assistance of which, the natural powers had sue ceeded in some degree, in confining the effused fluid matter from the general cavity of the ab- domen. But the same fluid matter, which, on first bursting forth, had produced so extensive an effu- sion of lymph, had also, by its permanent stimulus operating upon those portions of viscera within its reach, (but which had nevertheless assisted in setting boundaries to its influence,) latterly induced excitement, that parts previously exhausted, were incapable of supporting; and hence arose the rapid advances to a state of general mortification observed in the examination of the body. The above case exhibits an instance of what the energies of the constitution are capable of, in warding off the ill effects consequent to disease. These apparent efforts, however, are readily traced, as the natural results of those perfect laws, ac- cording to which the animal machine was first constituted; and which, agreeable to the original design, are adequate to the regulating and reco-

AND BLADDER. from inflammation, and a considerable effusion of coagulable lymph having taken place into the cells of the corpus spongiosum, had given a degree of permanent firmness to the contraction of the inner membrane. The inflamed part of the mucous membrane of the urethra was not only contracted, but was much thickened, and more firm in its texture than natu- ral, retaining also, in some degree, the high colour and increased vascularity belonging to inflammation, while that part of the canal immediately beyond it, towards the bladder, still possessed its healthy ap- pearance. At the bulb of the urethra was a firm stricture, so closely contracted that even in the relaxation of dead parts it was hardly possible to pass a silver probe, no larger than a bristle, through it. This close contraction, however, was found to have taken place only to the extent of l-6th of an inch. Finding the rectum closely adherent to the blad- der, I had dissected out a part of that intestine with the disease, to avoid any chance of injuring the prostate gland. The inner membrane of the gut was of a very unhealthy colour, and where it was connected with the prostate gland had somewhat of a fungous appearance. On a more particular ex- amination of this part an opening was found, passing from the cavity of the intestine into that of

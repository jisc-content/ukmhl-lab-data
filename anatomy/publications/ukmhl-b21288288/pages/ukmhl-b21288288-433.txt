OF THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. 4<13 were more or less swelled, as well as the hand itself, but the disease appeared to be confined to the finger, by which the poison had been inserted.' JBy the eighteenth of May, the extremity of the finger had ulcerated into a deep hole, at the bot- tom of which lay the diseased, and sloughing periosteum. A probe gently passed into the ulcerated opening at the back of the first joint, found its way backward within the soft parts, and between the metacarpal bones, coming out by the ulcer upon the palm of the hand. From this ex- amination it seemed very doubtful whether the metacarpal bone, in part at least, would not share the fate of the first phalanx, which was now e\d- dently dead, and appeared to be almost separated from the surrounding parts. The pain towards the base of the diseased finger continued to be extreme, although, with the excep- tion of this part, every thing now looked favourably. It appeared that her distress and pain arose principal- ly from the irritation produced by the separated piece of bone, upon the soft parts surrounding it. On the sixth of June, a bent probe was passed . under the first phalanx, but although, to appear- ance, perfectly detached, it required a very con- siderable force to move it; it was, however, loos- ened, and I then succeeded in raising it with ease from its vascular bed of granulations. The cavity bled freely, but for a few minutes only. On examining the bone that had been extracted, it was found to be entire, except towards the extremity foiming the joint with the metacarpal

BONES OF THE LIMB. 433 proofs that there was no justifiable ground for pro- posing any operation; for amputation required the soft parts to be sound above the disease, and the removal of the ends of the bones, with any prospect of their subsequent union, appeared to me to require the bone to be in a healthy state, instead of which it was evidently necrosed. In September, she remained much the same, except that the suppuration was becoming more considerable, while the increasing extent of the ulcerated cavities among the muscles in the upper part of the thigh, and the extensively diseased state- of the bone, entirely set a^de any idea of removing the limb. Subsequent to this period, however, she was induced to submit to an operation. The ends of the bones were exposed, and removed with a saw. The piece removed from the superior portion of the femur was, on examination, found to be ne- crosed at its internal part, connected with the medullary cavity, and was going through the pro- cess of separation from the external part of the cylinder, which was sound.

She continued to live in this helpless state for many months, till the end of September or beginning of October 1816, when she died from an attack of inflammation in the bowels. In the following case, a comparatively trifling y F

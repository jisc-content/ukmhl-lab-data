The pupil remained fixed, in a state of permanent contraction. He was, however, still able to perceive when he was brought near a window ; but this was all he could make out. For his relief, a bhster was laid behind each ear, and others applied to the lateral parts of the feet. Small doses of calomel also were ordered at short intervals, with a view to bring his system under the mercurial influence.

The blistering plasters removed, dressings of an irritating nature were applied, as it was deemed pecessary to keep up a considerable discharge for some time. In addition to the above plan, it was also directed that his feet should be immersed in warm water, morning and evening, and afterwards wrapped very warmly in flannels, to restore, if pos- sible, the wonted freedom of perspiration.

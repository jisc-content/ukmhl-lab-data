AFFECTIONS OF THE BRAIN sification, which had advanced to a very consider-, able extent. On a particular examination of the internal sur- face of the artery, many of the ossified masses were found raised into irregular projections, intruding into the cavity of the vessel. The general appear- ance hov/ever, was that of irregular patches of os- sific matter, deposited between the middle coat of the artery, and the inner membrane. From the surface of several of those ossifications that pro- jected into the cavity of the artery, the internal membranous lining had been removed; this had probably arisen from the irritation of the ossific deposit having produced an increased activity in the absorbents. Another obvious effect of irri- tation, produced by these masses of bone upon the coats of the artery, appeared on applying a gentle pressure to several of them, upon which globules of pus, some of them very large, were seen to start out from beneath. Some of the scales were found to be by this means nearly detached from their situation. Effusion of blood either into, or upon, some part of the brain, is, I think, in about nine cases out of ten, the exciting cause of apoplexy. Effusion of lymph, or serous fluid upon the surface of the brain in adults, is, generally speaking, more apt to connect itself with violent headach, or in its more advanced stages, convulsion. Where extreme se- verity of pain in the head has preceded an attack

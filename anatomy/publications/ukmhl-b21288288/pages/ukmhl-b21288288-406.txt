The cartilagi- nous surfaces of the bones had ulcerated away, and the apposed surfaces of the bones themselves were in some points becoming carious. The cartilagi- nous margin of the acetabulum remained, but it was rendered uneven, by the unequal growth of ossific matter, in several parts from the surface of contact between the cartilage and bone.* * Plate 5.

The anterior view of the upper part of the femur, upon which it maybe perceived that the principal part of the head of the bone is removed by absorption, the remaining portion being rendered uneven, in confor- mity with the depressions in that part of the acetabu- lum against which it was pressed by the action of the muscles.

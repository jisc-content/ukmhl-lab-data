OPERATION OF PUNCTURING THE BLADDER. p 4 the first kind, it is formed by those fistulous openings from the bladder, the nature of which has been already explained; where of the second, it consists in the puncture of the bladder, an oper- ation which has been variously performed, but m all cases with one and the same object, that of re- Heving the bladder from its load, and preventing its bursting from accumulation of urine. The puncture of the bladder has been proposed to be made in one of three ways, either by passing in a trocar through the abdominal parietes above the pubes, or by introducing the same instrument by the perinaeum into the bladder, or lastly by puncturing the bladder through the rectum. The operation has been successfully performed in each of these situations, but as the puncture from the rectum has most frequently terminated well, and as it is in my opinion, on several accounts, ' infinitely superior to either of the other methods, I shall only say a few words more in explaining this particular mode of relieving the bladder. The trocar need not be larger than that which is employed for hydrocele, although it must be somewhat longer, and should have a gentle even curvature. The form of the instrument should be that of the common trocar with a triangular point, as I have seen that the lancet pointed trocar is sure to divide whatever blood vessels fall in its way, while the triangular point pushes them aside without further injury.

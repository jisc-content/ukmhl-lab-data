152 TREATMENT REQUIRED, &C. The patient should be immediately requested to remain entirely at home, and to keep quiet. He should lose a little blood, either from the loins or perineum; his bowels should be kept gently re- laxed, he should take neither wine nor spirits, but observe a mild, cooling, and temperate diet, the above treatment being assisted by the occasional use of the hip bath, and the exhibition of an opiate at night. On no account, in this stage of the dis- ease, should either bougie or catheter be passed, the experiment can do no good, and its only ten- dency will be to increase the disturbance and irri- tation of the parts. The most usual course of the symptoms is that just described, but I have seen several instances, and one will be related *, in which the first intima- tion of any thing being wrong was a total stoppage in the passage of the urine, which complete reten- tion continued for several days, until at length for- tunately an instrument was so passed as to get beyond the obstruction, and draw off the urine. Sect. On the Introduction of the Catheter. When the difficulty in passing the water be- comes considerable, so as to be attended with much uneasiness and straining, it will be necessary to relieve the parts from the disturbance excited * See Case i6.

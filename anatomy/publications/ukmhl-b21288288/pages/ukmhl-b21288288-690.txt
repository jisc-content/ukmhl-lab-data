But although I have had opportunities of watching the progress of many such cases at the bedside, in very few of them has it ever been possible to distinguish with accuracy by the course of the symptoms, at what particular period either the suppuration or its preceding inflammation took place. When the prostate gland has suppurated the contents of the abscess may, by exciting inflam- mation, adhesion, and ulceration towards the pos- terior part of the gland, make their way into the rectum, so as to be evacuated by the anus; or the abscess may burst into the urethra or bladder, in either of which cases also the pus readily escapes; or lastly it may break into any part of the cellular membrane surrounding the gland, when inflam- mation will come upon some part of the perineum, and the abscess in this way will burst externally, leaving a fistulous disease more or less distressing, according to circumstances.

214 AFFECTIONS OF THE LUNGS. As to the mode of progression of this very extra- ordinary disease, there appears to me to be only one mode of explaining it, which is the following. At some former period an attack of inflammation had produced those strong and extensive adhesions that had formed over the whole of the left side of the chest. As these adhesions became in progress of time organized, or in other words vascular, the new capillary vessels, instead of exhaling the serous moisture proper to the surfaces of the pleura, had taken up a wrong action, secreting an albuminous or solid matter into the interstitial spaces of the cellular membrane; and as the tone of constitu- tional power was considerable, and the preceding adhesions comparatively firm, the matter subse- quently deposited in their interstices would necessa- rily form tumors possessing some degree of firmness. The mass of tuberculated adventitious substance, appeared to have been deposited principally in those adhesions situated between the left lung, medi- astinum, and sternum, judging from the situation in which the part of this structure that remained, w^as found on examination. It is also presumeable that, from some hidden cause, the inferior portion of this newly-formed mass eventually took on the suppurative action, and that this action continued to go on for a great length of time. The result of which would neces- sarily be the gradual accumulation of an immense collection of foetid purulent matter, with the gra- dual displacement of all the surrounding viscera, to the degree that has been described. 2

It gave no pain, nor any further trouble during the remainder of her Hfe. She died in November 1814, about foiu- years subsequent to the first appearance of the swelling: unfortunately the body was not allowed to be examined. In the following case, from the absence of par- ticular symptoms, and from the general appearance of the limb, there was so much obscurity as to the nature of the disease, that the surgeons who at- tended had much difiiculty in making up their mind upon the treatment.

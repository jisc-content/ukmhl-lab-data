44 THE UPPER LIMB. from changes which are effected in the arrangement of its fibres, may be divided into four stages :— Fh'st stage, . . Five separate nerves (viz., four lower cervical and first dorsal). Second stage, . . Three nerve-trunks (viz., an upper, middle, and lower). Third stage, . . Three anterior divisions and three posterior divisions. Fowih stage, . . Three nerve-cords (viz., an outer, inner, and a posterior). The first two of these stages are generally observed in the lower part of the posterior triangle of the neck, and the two last behind the clavicle and in the upper part of the axilla. It must be understood, however, that the points at which division and union of the different parts of the plexus take place are subject to variation. Infraclavicular Branches of the Brachial Plexus.—The branches of the brachial plexus are usually classified into two groups, viz., those which arise above the level of the clavicle, and those which take origin within the axilla. The latter group of nerves must now be studied by the dissector of the upper limb. They consist of a number of short branches, which end in the muscles forming the anterior and posterior walls of the axilla, and a series of large terminal branches, which are prolonged downwards into the upper arm. They are :— 1. Axillary h'anches— From outer cord: External anterior thoracic. From inner cord: Internal anterior thoracic. From posterior cord: Three subscapular nerves. 2. Brachial branches— From outer cord : Musculo-cutaneous. Outer head of median.

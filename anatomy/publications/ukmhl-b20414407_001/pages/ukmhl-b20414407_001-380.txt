On the other hand, the rectum is clothed from without inwards by—(i.) the anal fascia, a thin aponeurotic membrane which invests the outer surface of the levator ani; (2.) by the levator ani muscle; and (3.) by the rectal portion of the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia (Fig. 65). Strictly speaking, therefore, the perpendicular outer or ischial wall of the fossa is formed by the parietal layer of the pelvic fascia, and the sloping i?iner Fig. 65.—The arrow is directed upwards into the ischio- rectal fossa. The parietal pelvic fascia is seen upon the inner surface of the obturator internus.

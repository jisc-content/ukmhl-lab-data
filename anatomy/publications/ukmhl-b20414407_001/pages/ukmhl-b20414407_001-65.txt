PECTORAL REGION AND AXILLARY SPACE. 39 round the upper border of that muscle. Piercing the costo- coracoid membrane, it immediately divides into numerous branches, which diverge widely from each other. These receive different names, and are arranged as follows :—{a) The clavicular branch (ramus clavicularis), a small twig, runs upwards to the clavicle and then turns inwards along that bone between the clavicular part of the pectoralis major and the costo-coracoid membrane, {b) The pectoral branches (rami pectorales), of larger size, proceed downwards between the two pectoral muscles, give branches to both, and anastomose with the long thoracic and intercostal TA.

Some of its twigs supply the deltoid, whilst others pierce it to reach the upper surface of the acromion process, It anastomoses with the suprascapular and posterior circumflex arteries, {d) The huineral branch (ramus deltoideus), as a rule, takes origin from a trunk common to it and the preceding artery, and it runs downwards

THE UPPER LIMB. 156 viz., into the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform. Some of the fibres may be traced beyond the first carpal row on to the OS magnum. The Posterior Ligament is weak in comparison with the anterior ligament. The direction of its fibres is for the most part downwards and inwards. It arises above from the posterior aspect of the lower end of the radius, and is attached below to the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones. The External Lateral Ligament passes from the tip of the styloid process of the radius to the scaphoid bone. The Internal Lateral Ligament is round and cord-like. It stretches from the styloid process of the ulna to the cuneiform and pisiform bones. The four ligaments which we have described in connec- tion with the radio-carpal joint are more or less directly continuous with each other, and in consequence they form a capsule around the articulation. Articular Surfaces.—Divide the anterior and lateral liga- ments of the radio-carpal joint by a transverse incision carried across the front of the articulation. The hand can now be bent backwards, so as to expose fully the articular surfaces opposed to each other in this joint. The carpal surface is composed of the superior articular facets of the scaphoid and semilunar bones, and a very small articular facet on the extreme outer part of the upper surface of the cuneiform bone. Two interosseous ligaments stretch across the narrow intervals between these bones— one on either side of the semilunar—and complete the carpal surface. Formed of these factors, the carpal surface is convex both from before backwards and from without inwards. Further, it should be observed that it extends downwards to a greater extent behind than in front. The upper surface or socket is elongated from side to side, and concave in both directions, viz., from before backwards and from without inwards. The greater part of it is formed

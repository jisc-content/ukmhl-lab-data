THE LOWER LIMB. 266 1. A branch from the external popliteal. 2. External saphenous. 3. Internal saphenous. 4. Musculo-cutaneous. 5. Anterior tibial. The branch from the external popliteal frequently arises in common with the ramus communicans fibularis. It turns forwards, and is distributed upon the outer and anterior aspect of the leg in its upper part. The external saphenous nerve can be readily found. It reaches the outer margin of the foot by passing behind the external mal- leolus in company with the vein of the same name. Trace it forwards, and it will be found to end upon the fibular side of the little toe. On the dorsum of the foot a con- necting twig passes between the external saphenous and the outer division of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The internal or long saphe?tous nerve should be looked for in front of the inner malleolus. It descends in company with the internal saphenous vein. It can with care be followed half-way along the inner margin of the foot, but there it ends. Above the ankle-joint several minute twigs from this nerve may be found passing forwards to reach the front of the leg. The cutaneous portion of the musculo-aitaneous fierve appears in the lower third of the leg. It pierces the deep fascia a short way to the outside of the middle line of the limb. Almost immediately it splits into an inner and an outer part. The inner division may be traced first. It extends forwards on the dorsum of the foot, and sends one branch to the inner side of the great toe, and a second to supply the adjacent sides of the second and third toes. It likewise gives a number of twigs to the skin upon the inner margin of the foot, and effects a junction with the anterior tibial and internal saphenous nerves. The outer division is smaller than the inner part. It gives several twigs to the skin on the dorsum of the

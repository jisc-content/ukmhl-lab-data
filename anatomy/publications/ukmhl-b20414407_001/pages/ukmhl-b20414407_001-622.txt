586 ABDOMEN. extremity, and inflating it with air, a demonstration of its capacity may be obtained. Each vesicula seminahs is in reality a closed tube, five or six inches long, coiled upon itself and held in its present form by dense areolar tissue. When unravelled, several diver- ticula-will be observed to pro- ceed from the main tube. The narrow anterior end of the vesicle joins the vas deferens at an acute angle to form the common ejaculatory duct. Vas Deferens.—The vas de- ferens, or duct of the testicle, has already been traced to the internal abdominal ring, through which it enters the abdomen. Separating itself from the other factors of the spermatic cord, it now hooks round the deep epigastric artery, and descends upon the inner side of the external iliac artery into the pelvis. Here it is continued downwards upon the lateral surface of the bladder, and crosses the obliterated hypogastric artery. Then passing to the inner side of the ureter, it reaches the base of the viscus, where it becomes dilated and slightly sacculated, and lies upon the inner side of the seminal vesicle. As it proceeds onwards, it gradually incHnes to- wards the mesial plane, and at the base of the prostate it is joined by the narrow end of the vesicula seminalis of its own side. Triangle on the Base of the Bladder.—A line drawn from the middle of one seminal vesicle to a corresponding point in the other, would, under ordinary circumstances, indicate the line along which the peritoneum is reflected Fig. 136.—Seminal vesicle and vas deferens on the base of the bladder.

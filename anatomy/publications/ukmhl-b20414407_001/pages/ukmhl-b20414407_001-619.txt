The urethral orifice is situated at the level of the upper border of the symphysis pubis, and the anterior surface of the organ, entirely uncovered by peritoneum, is in contact with the lower two-thirds of that part of the posterior surface of the anterior abdominal wall which lies between the symphysis pubis and the umbilicus (Sym- ington). As growth goes on " the urethral orifice sinks rapidly from the period of birth up to the beginning of the fourth year, and more slowly from that period up to the beginning of the ninth year ; it now remains stationary until the commencement of puberty, and then it sinks slowly until it ultimately attains its normal adult position " (Disse).

The Ureters.—After entering the pelvis, the ureter of each side proceeds towards the base of the bladder in the posterior false vesical ligament at a lower level than the obliterated hypogastric artery. It enters the bladder about two inches behind the prostate, and about the same distance from its fellow of the opposite side.

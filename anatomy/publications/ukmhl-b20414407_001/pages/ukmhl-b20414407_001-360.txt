THE LOWER LIMB. 332 the ankle-joint very largely depends. Only a very narrow strip of the lower part of each of the opposing surfaces of the bones is articular and coated with cartilage. Above this, the surfaces are rough, and are held together by an exceedingly strong interosseous ligament, composed of short fibres which pass directly between the bones. In addition to this interosseous ligament there are: 1. An anterior ligament. 2. A posterior ligament. 3. An inferior transverse ligament. The anterior and posterior liganie?tts are flat strong bands which pass from the tibia to the fibula, in an oblique direc- tion, outwards and downwards. The inferior ligament lies under cover of the lower part of the posterior ligament, and to see it properly the latter should be divided. It is a strong narrow band of yellowish fibres, which takes a transverse course on the back of the joint and is firmly attached to both tibia and fibula, filling up the interval between them. Dissection.â€”To see the interosseous ligament of the inferior tibio- fibular joint the bones of the leg may be sawn through about two inches above the lower end of the tibia, and then divided with the saw from above downwards in a vertical-transverse, or coronal direction. This cut should be planned so as to pass through the inferior tibio-fibular joint. The short strong fibres of the interosseous ligament will then be seen, and also the short narrow articular interval between the lower portions of the opposing surfaces of the bones. The synovial membrane which lines this is a continuation upwards of the synovial membrane of the ankle-joint. THE ARTICULATIONS OF THE FOOT. The articulations of the foot are very numerous. They consist of: 1. The tarsal, tarso-metatarsal, and the inter-metatarsal joints. 2. The metatarso-phalangeal joints. 3. The interphalangeal joints.

FOREARM AND HAND. 147 dorsal aspect of the lower end of the radius, so as to form a series of six bridges or compartments for the tendons. Each of these is hned by a special synovial sheath, to facilitate the play of the tendons within it. The different compartments may now be successively opened up, so that the arrange- ment of the tendons with reference to the posterior annular ligament may be studied. The first coinpartmetit is placed on the outer side of the base of the styloid process of the radius, and corresponds Fig. 32.â€”Diagrammatic section through the lower end of the forearm to show the compartments of the posterior annular ligament. (From Reeves, slightly modified.) 1. First compartment, with the tendons of the extensor ossis and exten- sor primi internodii pollicis. 2. Second compartment, with the tendons of the two radial extensors. 3. Third compartment, with tendon of extensor secundi internodii pollicis. 4. Fourth compartment, with the tendons of the extensor communis and extensor indicis. 5. Fifth compartment, with the tendon of the extensor minimi digiti. 6. Sixth compartment, with the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris. with the broad oblique groove which is present in this part of the bone. It contains two tendons, viz., the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi and the extensor primi inter- nodii pollicis. The second compartnmit corresponds with the outermost groove on the dorsal aspect of the radius. This is broad and shallow, and it holds the tendons of the extensor carpi radialis longior, and of the extensor carpi radialis brevior. The third compartment is formed over the narrow deep intermediate groove on the back of the lower

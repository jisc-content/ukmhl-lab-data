499 ABDOMINAL CAVITY. by the splenic vein, which, however, lies at a lower level, and therefore altogether behind the pancreas. The following are the branches of the splenic artery :— The artericE pancreaticm parvcB are small twigs which come off at various points for the supply of the pancreas. The pancreatica magna is a larger branch which arises from the splenic artery near its termination. It sinks into the pan- creas, and is directed from left to right in the gland substance in company with the duct of the gland. The vasa brevia (arteriae gastricse breves) are five or six small arteries, of which some arise directly from the splenic, •whilst others take origin from its terminal branches. They run towards the stomach between the two layers of the gastro-splenic omentum, and are distributed to the cardiac end of this viscus, anastomosing with the coronary and left gastro-epiploic arteries. The left gastro-epiploic (arteria gastro-epiploica sinistra) takes origin from the splenic near the spleen, and is directed from left to right, along the greater curvature of the stomach, betw^een the two anterior layers of the great omentum. It gives branches which ascend to supply both aspects of the stomach, and others which descend into the great omentum, and it ends by anastomosing with the right gastro-epiploic artery. The splenic or terminal bratiches of the splenic artery reach the spleen by passing between the two layers of the lieno- renal ligament. The vasa brevia and the left gastro-epiploic artery take the same route to gain the interval between the two layers of the gastro-splenic omentum. From the above description of the branches of the coeliac axis it will be seen that the stomach is remarkably rich in I. Pancreatic. f Pancreaticce parvae. I Pancreatica magna.

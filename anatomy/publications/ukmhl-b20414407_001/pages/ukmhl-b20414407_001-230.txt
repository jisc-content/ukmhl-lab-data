THE LOWER LIMB. 202 fibres of the adductor magnus; follow it downwards, and it may be seen to enter the knee-joint by penetrating the posterior ligament. BACK OF THE THIGH. The dissection of the back of the thigh must be completed on the fourth day. The following are the structures which are brought into view :— 1. Superficial fascia. 2. Cutaneous nerves. 3. Deep fascia. r Biceps. 4. Muscles, Semitendinosus. Semimembranosus. Adductor magnus. 5. Nerves, | ^^^^^^ ^^l^^^^' I Great sciatic. 6. Arteries, Four perforating. Reflection of Skin.—A vertical incision must be made in the middle line of the thigh through the belt of skin which still encircles the limb posteriorly. The two flaps can then be reflected, the one outwards and the other inwards. Superficial Fascia — Cutaneous Nerves.—In the fatty superficial fascia thus brought into view cutaneous twigs from four sources must be looked for—(i) Along the middle Ime of the limb a few minute branches from the small sciatic may be discovered; (2) Towards the outer side of the thigh some twigs from the external cutaneous nerve may be detected ; (3) Lastly, towards the inner aspect of the limb endeavour to find some offsets from the internal cutaneous and obturator nerves. Deep Fascia.—On removing the superficial fascia the deep fascia will be observed to be exceedingly thin. It must now be turned aside, and in doing this be careful of

THE UPPER LIMB. 48 SHOULDER—SCAPULAR REGION. In the dissection of this region the following parts must be studied: — 1. Cutaneous nerves of the shoulder. 2. Deep fascia. 3. Deltoid muscle. 4. Sub-acromial bursa. 5. Anterior and posterior circumflex vessels. 6. Circumflex nerve. 7. Dorsalis scapulae artery. 8. Subscapularis muscle. 9. Supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and teres major muscles. 10. Bursoe in connection with the shoulder-joint. 11. Suprascapular nerve and artery. 12. Acromio-clavicular joint, and the coraco-acromial arch. The insertions of the muscles which have already been divided should first engage the attention of the student. These should be carefully defined and the precise extent of each studied. Begin with the omo-hyoid, which springs from the superior border of the scapula: then deal in the same way with the levator anguli scapulse, rhomboideus minor and major, which are attached to the vertebral border of the bone, and the serratus magnus, which is inserted into the ventral aspect of the superior and inferior angles, and the intervening portion of the vertebral border of the scapula. The insertion of the pectoralis minor into the coracoid process, and of the trapezius into both clavicle and scapula should also be thoroughly examined. When this has been done these divided muscles may be removed, with the exception of about half an inch of each, which it is advisable to leave attached to the bones for future reference. Dissection.—A block should now be placed in the axilla, and the skin removed from the upper and outer aspects of the shoulder as low down

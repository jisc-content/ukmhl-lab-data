TSK UPPER LIMB. pro Tim ;i \ pr;i.i;inT of liie little finger. It is supplied by the deep brsmdi of the ulnar nerve. The fiea^r brents niimTni digiti is composed of a single fie^iT belly which springs from the hook of the nnciform hone and the annrrlar hgament,. and is inserted into the tdnar ade of the proximal phalanx of the httle finger^ in common with the abductor. This mtrscle is sometimes much reduced in size^ and frequently more or less com- pletely irucorporated with the opponens. Its nerve supply eomes finam the det^ branch of the ninar nerve The o^pponem jnzrdTni dzgitz arises from the ^nrrn\:^T hga- merrt,. and the hook of - the unciform bone and its fibres spread out to obtain insertion into the entire length of the tdnar margin of tiie metacarpal bone of the litde finger. The deep branch of the ulnar gives it its nerve of supply. Bee Ds^ "BraTM^ Â«f iiks UlBar springs from the parent tnmk on the anterior aspect of the annular ligament. and gives off a branch which supphes the three short muscles of the little finger. Accompanied by the deep branch of the tdnar artery^ it then sinks into the interval between die abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti, and turns outwards across the palm tmder cover of the flexor tendons.. Jfear the radial border of the palm the deep branch of die ulnar nerve breaks up into terminal twigs, which supply die adductor transversus poflicisy the adductor obliquus polhci^ and the first dorsal interosseous muscle. In its course across die palm it lies along the concavity or upper border of the deep pahnar arch, and sends three fine branches forwards in front of the three interosseous spaces. These supply the interosseous muscles in those spaces^ while the two irmer also give branches to the deep surfe.ces of the two inner lumbrical muscles.^ The diird lumhrical has irenuentiy a douoie r.erve .vappiy. as in is not xxnccmmovL to find 3. secoad tw^ firom. die median entering its sipecfcial aspect.

ABDOMEN. 384 is not structurally continuous with the corpora cavernosa. It is a little mass of erectile tissue continuous with the pars intermedia, and fitting into a slight concavity which is formed for its reception on the extremities of the corpora cavernosa. Posteriorly, opposite the lower part of the symphysis pubis, the corpora cavernosa separate, and diverg- ing widely from each other, form the crura clitoridis. Each crus is attached by its deep surface to the rami of the pubis and ischium, and is covered by its own erector muscle. The clitoris, then, consists of three parts:—{\.) a glans continuous with the pars intermedia; (2.) a body composed SUSPENS. CLIT. CLITORIS CORP. CAV, CLIT. ORIF.

We have seen that the pars intermedia corresponds with the corpus spongiosum in the male. This apparatus in the female, therefore, closely resembles the penis in the male, the chief differences being the diminutive size of the clitoris, and the fact that the glans clitoridis is not perforated by the urethra. Dissection.—Detach the crura clitoridis from the sides of the pubic arch and throw them aside. This dissection requires care, because the

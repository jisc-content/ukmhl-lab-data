THE UPPER LIMB. 20 clavicular branches pass over the middle of the clavicle, and extend downwards, for some distance, in the super- ficial fascia over the pectoralis major. The supra-acrojuial branch crosses the outer third of the clavicle, and will be afterwards followed to the skin of the shoulder. These nerves can readily be found by cutting down upon the clavicle through the platysma muscle, and in the direc- tion of its fibres. The anterior cutaneous nerves are the minute terminal twigs of the intercostal trunks, and they become super- ficial by piercing the pectoralis major muscle and deep fascia close to the margin of the sternum. One will be found in each intercostal space, and they are accompanied by the perforating branches of the internal mammary artery, which (when injected) serve as the best guides to the nerves. They give slender twigs to the skin over the sternum, and larger branches which are directed out- wards, and may be traced as far as the anterior fold of the axilla. The lateral cutaneous nerves^ much larger than the pre- ceding, arise from the intercostal nerves, and appear on the side of the chest, along a line situated a little behind the anterior fold of the axilla. They pierce the chest wall in the interspaces between the ribs, and divide into anterior and posterior branches under cover of the serratus magnus muscle. These will be found appearing between the digitations of the serratus magnus. The anterior branches come out, as a rule, about an inch in front of the corre- sponding posterior branches, and then proceed forwards over the lower border of the pectoralis major muscle. From the lower members of this series some minute twigs are given off, which enter the superficial surface of the digi- tations of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. The posterior branches run backwards to the dorsal aspect of the trunk over the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi muscle.

ABDOMEN. 620 the limbs of the letter mingling with the decussating fibres of the internal pillars of the external abdominal ring. The deep fibres are transverse, and extend across from one bone to the other. The posterior pubic ligament consists of a very few fibres on the posterior aspect of the joint. The supra-pubic ligament^ like the preceding, is weak. It is placed upon the upper aspect of the symphysis, and stretches between the crests of the two pubic bones. The infra- or sub-pubic ligament, which is situated on the lower aspect of the joint, rounds off the apex of the pubic arch. It is a strong band, somewhat triangular in shape, which is attached on each side to the descending ramus of the pubic bone, and above, to the fibro-cartilaginous disc. Between the crescentic lower margin of this ligament and the upper border of the transverse perineal band of the triangular ligament of the urethra, there is an oval aperture through which the dorsal vein of the penis passes back- wards. Dissection.—The saw should now be used, and a portion sliced off from the front of the joint. The intervening plate of fibro-cartilage can in this way be studied. It will be seen to be thicker and denser in front than behind. As a general rule, a small synovial cavity will be found towards its back part, and nearer its upper than its lower end. The Obturator or Thyroid Membrane.—This is the membrane which stretches across the thyroid foramen. It is attached to the circumference of the foramen, except at its upper part, where it bridges across the groove on the under surface of the horizontal ramus of the pubic bone, and converts it into a foramen for the escape of the obturator vessels and nerves. At this point it is continuous over the upper border of the obturator internus muscle with the parietal pelvic fascia.

512 ABDOMEN. are the trabeculce^ and they constitute the supporting frame- work of the gland-pulp. On account of this arrangement, it will be found utterly impossible to strip off the fibrous coat of the spleen without at the same time lacerating its surface. Make a section through the organ, and carry a portion of it to the tap. By squeezing it and allowing the water to run freely over it, a view of the trabecular framework may be obtained. Dissection.—Detach the pancreas from the duodenum, but leave a portion of the duct in connection with the gut. Next clean out the stomach and duodenum by allowing water to run freely through them, and then render their walls tense by inflating them with air. The Coats of the Stomach should now be examined. They are five in number, viz. :— 1. Peritoneal, or serous. 4. Submucous. 2. Subserous. 5. Mucous. 3. Muscular. The serous coat., derived from the peritoneal membrane, can be best stripped off with the fingers. The subserous coat is composed of a little areolar tissue which intervenes between the muscular and serous strata. The branches of the two pneumogastric nerves can now be followed, as they spread out upon both surfaces of the stomach. The muscular coat consists of involuntary or unstriped muscular fibres, and these are disposed in three layers— each layer being distinguished by the direction of its fibres. The external layer is composed of longitudinal fibres. These are best seen at the curvatures and towards the pylorus. At the cardiac orifice they become continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the oesophagus, and at the pyloric orifice they mix with the longitudinal fibres of the duodenum. Very few longitudinal fibres can be detected on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the viscus. The middle layer is composed of circular fibres, and these con- stitute a uniform coating for the stomach. Very thin at the fundus, this layer becomes gradually thicker as we approach

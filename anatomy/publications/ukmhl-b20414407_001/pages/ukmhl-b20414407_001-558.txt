ABDOMEN. 522 points, it will be necessary to remove a sheath of areolar tissue which surrounds the hepatic ducts and vessels, and which is termed Glissoji's capsule. If the dissector now investi- gates the composition of the wall of the gall-bladder, he will find that, in addition to its partial serous covering, it has— (i.; a strong coat composed of muscular and white fibrous tissue, and (2.) an internal mucous coat. The first can be seen by stripping off the peritoneum, andthe second Fig. 114.— Cystic and is best displayed by laving open hepatic ducts. (From the gall-bladder with a pair of Gegenbaur. moditied.) scissors. The mucous membrane will then be seen to be elevated into ridges which join with each other so as to form an alveolar arrangement—the meshes or depressions having a polygonal form. The cystic duct should also be laid open, when the mucous membrane in this will be observed to be raised into oblique crescentic folds, which, when viewed collectively, have a spiral appearance. Dissection.—The umbilical fissure, the fissure for the ductus venosus, and the transverse fissure of the liver should now be opened up, and the structures contained within them dissected out. The Vessels of the Liver.—Blood enters the liver —(i.) by the hepatic artery, (2.) by the large portal vein : whilst it is led away from the liver by the hepatic vei?is. The hepatic artery is a branch of the coeliac axis, and carries arterial blood for the nourishment of the liver sub- stance. It divides into two branches which enter the liver at the extremities of the transverse fissure. The portal vein carries venous blood, which it has gathered from the entire length of the abdominal portion of

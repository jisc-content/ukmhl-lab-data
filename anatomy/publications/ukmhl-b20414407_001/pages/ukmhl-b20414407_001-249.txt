221 FRONT OF THE THIGH. Quadriceps extensor, Rectus femoris. Vastus internus. Crureus and subcrureus. 1^ Vastus externus. 9. Tensor fasciae femoris muscle. 10. Deep layer of the ilio-tibial band of fascia lata. 11. The external and internal intermuscular septa. Poupart's Ligament—Gimbernat's Ligament.—^Although, properly speaking, both of these ligaments belong more to the abdominal wall than the thigh, it is very essential that the dissector should obtain some knowledge of their connections before he proceeds further with the dissection. Pouparfs liga77iefit is merely the thickened lower border of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of the abdominal wall folded backwards upon itself. It thus presents a rounded surface towards the thigh, and a grooved surface towards the abdomen. By its outer extremity it is fixed to the anterior superior spine of the ilium. Internally, it has a double attachment, viz.—(i) to the spine of the pubis; (2) through the medium of Gimbernat's ligament to the inner part of the ilio- pectineal line. Poupart's ligament pursues an oblique course between its iliac and pubic attachments, and at the same time describes a gentle curve, the convexity of which is turned downwards. By its lower border it affords attachment to the fascia lata, and when this is divided it loses its curved direction. Gimbernafs ligament is a small triangular piece of aponeurotic fascia which occupies the interval between the inner part of Poupart's ligament and the inner inch of the ilio-pectineal line—being attached by its margins to both. Its base is sharp, crescentic, and free, and abuts against the femoral sheath. Gimbernat's ligament occupies a very oblique plane; its femoral surface looks downwards, whilst its abdominal surface is directed upwards. Dissection.—The exposure of the femoral sheath is the next step in the dissection of the thigh. To attain this object the iliac portion of

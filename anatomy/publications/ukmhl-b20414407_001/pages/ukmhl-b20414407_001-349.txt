Fig. 61.—Vertical antero-posterior section through the knee-joint. Within the joint the dissector is now able to recognise : 1. The two crucial ligaments. 2. The two semilunar cartilages. Synovial Membrane.—This is the most extensive mem- brane of the kind in the body. It lines the deep surface of the ligamentous structures which surround the joint, and extends upwards for at least an inch beyond the articular surface of the femur, in the form of a great cul-de-sac^ under cover of the common tendon of the quadriceps. By its upper part this pouch usually communicates by an orifice of greater or less width with a large bursa which lies at a VOL. I.—21

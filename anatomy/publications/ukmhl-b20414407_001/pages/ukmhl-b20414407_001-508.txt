To understand the coro?iary ligament aright, it must be borne in mind that an irregular area on the posterior surface of the right lobe of the liver is devoid of peritoneum, and that this area is in direct apposition with the diaphragm, to which it is connected by some loose areolar tissue. The peri- toneum covering the upper surface of the liver is reflected at the upper Hmit of this bare area directly on to the diaphragm ; llgamentuin teres with suspensory ligament. vena cava.

The lower layer of the ligament is formed at the lower limit of the bare area by the reflection of the peri- toneum from the under surface of the liver on to the upper part of the right kidney and the vena cava inferior. The two layers, therefore, of the coronary ligament are not in contact with each other, but are separated by a distance equal to the breadth of the bare surface of the liver (Figs. 102 and 112).

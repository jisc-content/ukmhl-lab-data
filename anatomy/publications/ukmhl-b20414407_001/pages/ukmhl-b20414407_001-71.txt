PECTORAL REGION AND AXILLARY SPACE. 45 From inner cord: Inner head of median. Ulnar. Internal cutaneous. Lesser internal cutaneous. From posterior cord: Circumflex. Musculo-spiral. The Anterior Thoracic Nerves are the branches of supply to the pectoral muscles, or, in other words, to the two muscles which form the anterior wall of the axilla. The external anterior thoracic nerve springs from the outer cord of the plexus, pierces the costo-coracoid membrane above the level of the pectoralis minor, and breaks up into branches which sink into the deep surface of the pectoralis major. The internal anterior thoracic nerve., somewhat smaller, arises from the inner cord of the plexus, and passing forwards between the axillary artery and vein enters the deep surface of the pectoralis minor. After supplying this muscle its terminal filaments emerge from its anterior surface, and sink into the pectoralis major. The pectoralis major is therefore supplied by both ante- rior thoracic nerves; the pectoralis minor by the internal anterior thoracic nerve alone. Close to their origin the two nerves are usually united by an arch or loop, thrown over the front of the axillary artery; in other cases they may join in a plexiform manner, before proceeding to their destinations. Subscapular Nerves.â€”The three subscapular nerves spring from the posterior cord of the plexus, and supply the three muscles which form the posterior wall of the axilla. The upper subscapular 7ierve is placed high up in the axilla. It is very short, sometimes double, and it sinks into the substance of the subscapularis muscle. The lofig or middle subscapular nerve accompanies the subscapular artery and supplies the latissimus dorsi. The loiver subscapular 7ierve gives twigs to the lower

THE UPPER LIMB. 72 which, continuous with the fascia above and below, bridges across the brachial artery, and is lost upon the pronator radii teres muscle on the inner side of the forearm. The brachial aponeurosis may be reflected by making an incision through it along the middle line of the front of the arm. In throwing the inner portion inwards, the dissector must leave the bicipital fascia in position. This may be done by separating it artificially from the general aponeurosis by an incision above and below it. By this dissection it Fig. 20.â€”Diagram (after Turner) to show how the upper arm is divided by the intermuscular septa and bone into an anterior and posterior compartment. These compartments are represented in transverse section. e. External intermuscular septum; z, Internal inter- muscular septum. will be made evident that septa or partitions pass in between the muscles from the deep surface of the investing brachial aponeurosis. Two of these possess a superior strength, and obtain direct attachment to the humerus. They are the external and internal intermuscular septa. The connections of these cannot be fully studied at present, but it is important that the student should understand their relations at this stage. In the course of the dissection of the upper arm they will gradually be displayed.

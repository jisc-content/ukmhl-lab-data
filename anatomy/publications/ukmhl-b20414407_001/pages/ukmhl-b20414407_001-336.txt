3o8 THE LOWER LIMB. The Musculus Accessorius takes a course straight forwards from the heel, and acts as a direct flexor of the toes. It also tends to bring the tendons of the long flexor muscle into a line with the toes upon which they operate. It arises by two heads which embrace the os calcis and the long plantar liga- ment. The i7iner head, wide and fleshy, springs from the Fig. 59,â€”Vertical section through the foot, along a line stretching from the centre of the heel behind to the centre of the great toe in front.

Thick superficial fascia of heel. inner concave surface of the os calcis; the outer head, narrow, pointed, and tendinous, takes origin from the outer surface of that bone, and also from the long plantar liga- ment. The musculus accessorius is inserted into the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum in the middle of the sole. It is supplied by a branch from the external plantar nerve.

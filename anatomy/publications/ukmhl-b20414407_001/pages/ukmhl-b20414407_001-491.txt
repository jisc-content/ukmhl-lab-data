ABDOMINAL CAVITY. 461 The colon. movable within the cavity. They tend to lie more in the left portion of the abdominal cavity than in the right part^ and they occupy the umbilical, hypogastric, lumbar, and iliac regions. A few coils extend downwards into the pelvis, and not uncommonly some coils of the jejunum may be found in the left hypochondrium. The Large Intestine. — The large intestine, although possessing a much wider calibre than the small intestine, is not nearly so long. It extends from the right iliac fossa tO' the anus, and it rarely measures more than five or six feet in length. Like the small intestine, it is widest in its com- mencement, and gradually diminishes in diameter as it advances towards its termination. It is subdivided arbi- trarily into the following parts :— The coecum. ^Ascending colon. Hepatic flexure. Transverse colon. Splenic flexure. Descending colon. ^wSigmoid flexure. The rectum. The ccecu7n is the blind commencement of the great intestine. It lies in the right iliac fossa, on the ilio-psoas muscle, and being as a rule completely enveloped by the peritoneum, it is allowed some latitude of movement When distended it is in contact with the anterior abdominal wall, and its most dependent part corresponds to Poupart's hgament in its outer part. The ileum opens into it upon its inner and hinder aspect about two and a-half inches above its blind end, and marks the point where it becomes continuous with the ascending colon. This junction, as we have already noted, takes place in the lower part of the right lumbar region, in the immediate neighbourhood of the iliac crest. In connection with the caecum the dissector will find the vermiform appendix. This is a narrow caecal tube, which

THE LOWER LIMB, 278 Anterior Tibial Nerve.â€”The anterior tibial nerve is one of the terminal branches of the external popliteal. It arises on the outer side of the neck of the fibula, and. piercing the upper part of the extensor longus digitorum obliquely, joins the anterior tibial vessels a short dis- tance below the external tuberosity of the tibia. These it accompanies for the remainder of its course. In the first instance it is placed in front of them, but near the ankle- joint it lies on their outer side. Passing behind the ante- rior annular ligament, it ends by dividing into an internal and an external branch. In its course through the leg the anterior tibial nerve gives muscular branches to the extensor longus digitorum, tibialis anticus, the extensor longus hallucis, and the pero- neus tertius ; likewise a fine ariicular hvig to the ankle- joint. The internal terminal branch of the anterior tibial ner^ e is continued forwards upon the dorsum of the foot along the outer side of the dorsalis pedis artery. Reaching the first interosseous space it pierces the deep fascia, and divides to supply the contiguous margins of the great toe and the second toe (p. 267). Before it reaches the surface, it fur- nishes articular tzvigs to the tarso-metatarsal and metatarso- phalangeal joints of the great toe, and frequently also a fine muscular t^vig to the dorsal surface of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. The external terminal branch of the anterior tibial nerve turns abruptly outwards under cover of the extensor brevis digitorum, and ends on the dorsum of the foot in a gangli- form enlargement. From this branches proceed for the supply of the extensor bre\-is digitorum, and the numerous articulations in the neighbourhood. One fine filament can, in most cases, be traced to the second dorsal inter- osseous muscle. The terminal swelling resembles closely the corresponding enlargement in which the posterior interosseous nerve of the upper limb ends.

FOREARM AND HAND. It is not likely that these synovial sheaths have been pre- served intact throughout the previous dissection of forearm and palm, but should they turn out to be uninjured, a very striking demonstration may be obtained by inflating them with air by means of the blowpipe. The apertures through which the air is introduced should be made at the upper margin of the annular ligament. It is said that the synovial sac which invests the tendons of the flexor sublimis and flexor profundus is divided by a vertical partition into two compartments, and that the outer of these communicates, by means of a small aperture near the upper border of the annular ligament, with the synovial sheath of the tendon of the flexor longus poUicis. Flexor Tendons.â€”Open the carpal tunnel by making a vertical incision through the anterior annular ligament at its middle. The arrangement of the flexor tendons can now be studied, and the synovial sheath dissected from the surface of each. The tendon of the flexor longus pollicis occupies the outer part of the canal, and gaining the palm turns out- wards to reach the phalanges of the thumb. The four tendons of the flexor sublimis are arranged in pairs behind the annular ligament; those for the little and index fingers lying behind those for the ring and middle fingers. Of the tendons of the flexor profundus., only that for the index finger is distinct and separate, the other three as a rule remain united until they emerge from under cover of the annular ligament. In the central compartment of the palm the flexor tendons diverge from each other, and two, viz., one from the flexor sublimis, and one from the flexor profundus, go to each of the four fingers. From the tendons of the flexor profundus, the lumbrical muscles take origin, and these, with the digital nerves and arteries, will be seen occupying the intervals between the tendons as they approach the roots of the fingers. In the fingers the two flexor tendons run downwards upon.

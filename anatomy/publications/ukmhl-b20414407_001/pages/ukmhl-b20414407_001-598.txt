ABDOMEN. 562 Dissection from the side.—To reach the pelvic fascia from this aspect a portion of the bony wall of the pelvis must be removed, and the obturator internus muscle raised from its position. The outer aspect of the innominate bone must first be thoroughly cleaned, by removing the remains of the obturator externus muscle and all adhering portions of muscle from the pubic and ischial bones ; carefully preserve, however, the obturator nerve and artery as they emerge from the upper part of Fig. 125.—The dotted lines indicate the directions in which the saw must be carried through the bone. the thyroid foramen. The membrane which closes the thyroid foramen may also be taken away, with the exception of a small portion imme- diately adjoining the canal under the pubic bone, through which the obturator vessels and nerve emerge. This will expose a part of the outer surface of the obturator internus muscle, and the parietal pelvic fascia will be observed arching over the border of the muscle to join the thyroid membrane below the obturator vessels. Next, define the

56 THE UPPER LIMB. Acromio-clavicular Articulation.—This is a diarthrodial joint, and the hgaments which bind the bones together are:— The superior acromio-clavicular ligame?it is a broad band, composed of stout fibres, which is placed on the upper aspect of the joint. The inferior acromio-clavicular ligametit which closes the joint below is not so strongly developed. In front and behind these ligaments are connected with each other so as to constitute a capsule. The joint should now be opened, when it will be seen to be lined by a synovial membrane. An imperfect inter articular fibro- cartilage is also usually present. It is wedge-shaped, and connected by its base to the superior ligament, whilst its free margin is directed downwards between the bones. The Coraco-clavicular Ligament is very powerful. It binds the under surface of the clavicle to the base of the coracoid process. When thoroughly cleaned and defined it will be seen to consist of two parts, which are termed respectively conoid and trapezoid. The conoid ligament^ placed upon the posterior and inner aspect of the trapezoid, is broad above where it is attached to the conoid tubercle of the clavicle, and somewhat nar- rower below at its attachment to the inner part of the root of the coracoid process. The trapezoid ligament is the anterior and external part. Above it is attached along the trapezoid line of the clavicle, whilst below it is fixed to the upper aspect of the coracoid process. In the recess between these two ligaments a bursa will usually be found. Coraco-acromial Arch.—It is necessary to examine this arch at the present stage, as the next step in the dissection will, in a great measure, destroy it. It is the arch which overhangs the shoulder-joint and protects it from above. Ligaments proper to theri. Superior joint, . . . .^2.

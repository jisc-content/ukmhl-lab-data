THE LOWER LIMB. 282 brevis and the extensor longus digitorum. In the lower third of the leg it pierces the fascia, and becomes cutaneous. TIBIAL REGION. This region corresponds to the subcutaneous or inner surface of the tibia. The deep fascia blends with the periosteum of the bone, and the only structures which have to be examined are :â€” 1. The internal saphenous vein. 2. The internal saphenous nerve. 3. The expanded tendons of insertion of the sartorius, semitendinosus, and gracilis. 4. Internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint. 5. Inferior internal articular artery and nerve. The internal saphenous iierve and vein., as they pass from the anterior to the posterior tibio-fibular region, cross obliquely over the lower third of the inner surface of the tibia. The insertion of the sartorius., gracilis., and semitendinosus into the upper part of the inner surface of the tibia should again be examined. Observe how the sartorius overlaps the tendons of the other two, and how the tendon of the gracilis overlaps the upper part of the tendon of the semi- tendinosus. A synovial bursa separates these tendons from each other. The internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint will be seen extending downwards for a short distance upon the inner aspect of the shaft of the tibia. Passing forwards under cover of this ligament, so as to gain the anterior aspect of the knee, are the inferior internal articular vessels and nerve.

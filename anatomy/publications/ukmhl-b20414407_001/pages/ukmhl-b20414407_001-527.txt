491 ABDOMINAL CAVITY. more numerous in the jejunum than in the ileum. They diminish gradually in number and in size as we pass down the small intestine. Beyer's patches and solitary glands must also be looked for. Frequently they are difficult to find, but by holding the bowel up to the light they can generally be detected. In our examination of the Peyer's patches it is better to begin at the lower end of the ileum and pass upwards. A Peyer's patch consists of a large number of lymphoid follicles grouped together so as to present to the eye a patch of an elongated, oblong figure. The patches are placed upon that aspect of the gut which is opposite to the line of the mesenteric attachment, and the long axis of each corresponds in its direction with that of the gut itself. In the lower part of the ileum the patches may present a length of one, two, or even four inches, and a breadth of about half-an-inch, but, as we follow them up the tube into the jejunum, they become much smaller and not nearly so numerous. The total number varies much, but the average number may be stated to be about thirty. They are more numerous in the young, and not so abundant in later periods of life. Indeed, in very old individuals they may disappear almost entirely. The solitary glands are isolated lymphoid follicles, scat- tered everywhere over the mucous membrane of the small intestine. They are minute, rounded or ovoid, opaque white bodies, about the size of a millet seed, and they usually cause a slight bulging of the mucous membrane at the points where they occur. The valvules connive?ites, the villi, and Peyer's patches are the only special peculiarities of the mucous membrane of the jejunum and ileum which are visible to the naked eye, and from what has been said regarding them the dissector will understand that although they are not arranged in such a way as mark off by a clear fine of demarcation the jejunum from the ileum, they are sufficient to enable him to dis-

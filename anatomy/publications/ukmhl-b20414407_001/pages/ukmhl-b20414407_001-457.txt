427 ABDOMINAL WALL, border of which it sinks, after dividing into several smaller twigs. The spermatic veins issue from the testicle at its posterior border, and as they pass upwards they form in the cord a bulky plexus, which is termed the spermatic or pam- piniform plexus. A single vessel issues from this, which enters the abdomen through the internal abdominal ring. On the right side it pours its blood into the inferior vena cava; on the left side it joins the left renal vein. The vas deferens^ the duct of the testicle, can always be distinguished by the hard, firm, cord-like sensation which it gives when the spermatic cord is held between the finger and thumb. It ascends along the posterior part of the cord. At the internal abdominal ring, however, it separates from the spermatic vessels, and lies to their inner side, and as it enters the abdomen it hooks round the deep epigastric artery. The artery to the vas deferens is a small branch from the superior vesical. It follows the duct to the testicle. The sympathetic filaments extend downwards upon the spermatic artery. They come from the renal and aortic plexuses. The spermatic lymphatics enter the abdomen through the internal abdominal ring, and join the lumbar glands. The Testicle.â€”The testicle should next be examined. First note its position in the scrotum. It lies somewhat obliquely, with its upper end directed forwards and out- wards, and its lower end backwards and inwards. The left testicle hangs at a lower level than the right. Each testicle is enveloped by the tunica vaginalis testis. The tunica vaginalis is a serous sac, and consequently presents a parietal or scrotal portion, and a visceral or testicular portion. Its extent can be demonstrated in a striking manner by making a small aperture in the parietal part, and then introducing a blow-pipe into the serous cavity and inflating it with air. It will be seen to be con- siderably larger than the gland which it envelops. It

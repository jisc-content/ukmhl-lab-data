By means of these partitions and the mediastinum testis, the space enclosed by the tunica albuginea becomes broken up into a large number of loculi or compartments, the walls of which are imperfect. Such is the fibrous frame- work of the body of the testicle. The blood vessels have a very definite arrangement with reference to this framework. Passing in through the mediastinum they spread out on the deep surface of the Fig. 88.â€”Diagram illustrating the structure of the testicle. (From Gegenbaur.) tunica albuginea, and upon both surfaces of the fibrous lamellae which bound the testicular compartments. The vascular mesh-work thus formed is sometimes called the tunica vasculosa. The proper glandular substance of the testis is lodged within the compartments described above. It consists of an enormous number of fine hair-like tubes, termed the seminiferous tubules. Two or more occupy each compart- ment, and constitute what is called a testicular lobule. In

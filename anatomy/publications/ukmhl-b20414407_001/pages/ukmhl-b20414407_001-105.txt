FRONT OF THE ARM. 79 communication to the intercosto-humeral. The ittternal cutaneous gives off the branch which pierces the fascia to supply the skin in front of the biceps. The Median and the Ulnar Nerves.—These large nerve- trunks do not furnish any branches in the upper arm. The median arises in the axilla by two heads from the outer and inner cords of the brachial plexus. It proceeds down- wards upon the outer and superficial aspect of the axillary and brachial arteries, until it approaches the level of the insertion of the coraco-brachialis. Here it lies in front of the artery. Finally, it reaches the inner side of the vessel, and maintains this position for the rest of its course in the upper arm. The ulnar nerve is the largest branch of the inner cord of the brachial plexus. It descends upon the inner side of the axillary and brachial arteries, and at the insertion of the coraco-brachialis it encounters the inferior profunda artery. Accompanied by this vessel, it now leaves the brachial artery by passing backwards through the internal intermuscular septum, and it is continued downwards upon the posterior aspect of this aponeurotic partition, to the interval between the olecranon and internal condyle of the humerus. Dissection.—The muscles should now be thoroughly cleaned, and the musculo-cutaneous nerve and its branches dissected out. Musculo-cutaneous Nerve.—The musculo-cutaneous nerve arises from the outer cord of the brachial plexus, at the lower border of the pectoralis minor. Inclining outwards, it perforates the coraco-brachialis, and appears between the biceps and the brachialis anticus. It proceeds obliquely downwards between these muscles until it reaches the bend of the elbow, where it comes to the surface at the outer border of the tendon of the biceps. From this point onwards it has already been traced as a cutaneous nerve of the forearm (p. 67).

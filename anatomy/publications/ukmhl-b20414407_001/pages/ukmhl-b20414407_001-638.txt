ABDOMEN. 6o2 thyroid foramen as far back as the great sciatic notch. A few fibres are also derived from the parietal pelvic fascia which covers it. From this origin the fibres converge towards the small sciatic notch, and end in a tendon which issues from the pelvis through the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. Entering the gluteal region, it is inserted in conjunction with the gemelli muscles into the upper part of the great tro- chanter of the femur. The small sciatic notch, over which the tendon glides, is coated with smooth cartilage, and this is raised into three or four parallel ridges, which fit into fissures upon the deep surface of the tendon. A synovial bursa intervenes between them. The obturator internus is supplied by a special branch from the upper part of the sacral plexus. The Pyriformis is placed against the anterior aspect of the posterior wall of the pelvis. It arises by three processes, from the anterior surface of the second, third, and fourth sacral vertebrae between the sacral foramina; it also takes origin from the innominate bone, where it forms the upper part of the great sciatic notch, and from the great sacro- sciatic ligament. The muscle leaves the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, and is inserted by a rounded tendon into the top of the great trochanter of the femur. It is supplied by branches from the sacral plexus. Coats of the Rectum.—Turning now to the viscera, separate the rectum from the bladder and prostate, and, having stuffed it with tow, or inflated it with air, proceed to dissect its walls. It presents the same coats as the colon, viz. :— 1. Serous. I 3. Muscular. 2. Subserous. | 4. Submucous. 5. Mucous. The serous coat has already been examined. It is complete in the first part of the rectum, partial in the second part, and altogether absent from the third part. The subserous coat is the loose flocculent areolar tissue which

543 ABDOMINAL CAVITY. furthermore, it is crossed by the large sympathetic twigs which connect the aortic and hypogastric plexuses, and, close to its termination, by the ureter. On the left side the superior haemorrhoidal artery also passes down in front of the common iliac artery. The position of the corresponding veins should be carefully noted. This differs on the two sides of the body. The left common iliac vein is in relation to both arteries. It first lies along the inner or right side of its companion artery, and then crosses behi7id the upper part of the right artery to reach the vena cava inferior. The right common iliac vein at first lies behind its companion artery, but, as it ascends, it gradually comes to lie upon its right side, and here it joins the vena cava. Each common iliac vein is formed by the junction of the external and internal iliac veins. No collateral branches of any consequence proceed from the common iliac artery. The common iliac vein of each side is joined by the ilio-lumbar vein. The left common iliac vein also receives the middle sacral vein. The External Iliac Artery is the first or abdominal portion of the great arterial trunk which carries blood to the lower limb. It begins, as we have seen, opposite the lumbo- sacral articulation, and extends obliquely downwards and outwards along the brim of the true pelvis to Poupart's ligament, behind which it passes into the thigh, and becomes the femoral artery. Its course can be indicated on the surface with tolerable accuracy by drawing a line from a point a little below and to the left side of the umbilicus to a point midway between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior spine of the ilium. Like the common iliac arter}', the external iliac is closely covered by peritoneum. On the right side it passes behind the terminal part of the ileum, whilst on the left side it presents a similar relation to the sigmoid flexure of the

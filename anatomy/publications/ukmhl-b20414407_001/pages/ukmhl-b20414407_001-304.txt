THE LOWER LIMB. 276 extensor longus hallucis and tibialis anticus. It inosculates with branches from the posterior tibial artery. Arteria Dorsalis Pedis.—The dorsal artery of the foot is the continuation of the anterior tibial. It begins in front of the ankle-joint at a point midway between the two malleoli, and it extends forwards upon the forepart of the astragalus, the scaphoid, and the middle cuneiform bones to the posterior part of the interosseous space between the metatarsal bones of the great toe and the second toe. Here it leaves the dorsum of the foot by dipping down- wards between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle to reach the sole and unite with the external plantar artery in the formation of the plantar arch. Its relations on the dorsum of the foot are very simple, (i.) It lies in the interval between the tendon of the extensor longus hallucis on the inner side and the innermost tendon of the extensor longus digitorum on the outer side. (2.) At its commence- ment it is crossed by the lower part of the anterior annular ligament, whilst near its termination it is crossed by the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum; with these exceptions the vessel is simply covered by the inte- gument and fascia. (3.) The internal terminal branch of the anterior tibial nerve Hes along its outer side, and two vence coinites accompany it. As the dorsalis pedis artery traverses the dorsum of the foot it gives off several twigs to the inner margin of the foot, and also three named branches :— 1. The tarsal. 2. The metatarsal. 3. The first dorsal interosseous. Tarsal and Metatarsal Arteries.—The tarsal artery arises opposite the scaphoid bone, and the metatarsal artery near the bases of the metatarsal bones. They both run outwards under cover of the extensor brevis digitorum to reach the outer margin of the foot. There they anastomose

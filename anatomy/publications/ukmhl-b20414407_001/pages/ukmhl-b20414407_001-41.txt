PECTORAL REGION AND AXILLARY SPACE. 15 The dissector of the arm now stops work for two days. He has completed the dissection of all the dorsal struc- tures which are allotted to him, and he has nothing further to do until the body is turned. PECTORAL REGION AND AXILLARY SPACE. On resuming work the dissector will find the body lying upon its back. The chest is raised to a convenient height by means of blocks. A long board is placed under the shoulders for the purpose of supporting the arms when they are abducted from the sides (Fig. 4). In dissecting the axilla and chest it will be found advantageous if the dissectors of the arm and of the head and neck arrange to work at different hours. The dissector of the head and neck at this stage is engaged at the posterior triangle of the neck, and this dissection cannot be well done unless the arm be placed close to the side and the shoulder depressed. For the dissection of the axilla the arm should be stretched out at right angles to the chest. A com- promise between these two positions always results in discomfort to both dissectors. In the dissection of the pectoral region and the axillary space the student meets with the following structures:— 1. Superficial fascia. 2. Cutaneous nerves. 3. Mammary gland. 4. Deep fascia—Axillary fascia. 5. Muscles which enter into the formation of the walls of the axilla : a. Pectoralis major. d. Teres major. b. Pectoralis minor. e. Latissimus dorsi. c. Subscapularis. /. Coraco-brachialis. g. Serratus magnus. 6. Costo-coracoid membrane. 7. Cephalic vein.

PECTORAL REGION AND AXILLARY SPACE. 47 parts, {a) The upper part, composed of the large first digita- tion alone, arises from the first and second ribs, and from a tendinous arch between them. The fibres converge, to be inserted into a somewhat triangular surface in front of the superior angle of the scapula, {b) The jniddle part consists of two digitations which take origin from the second and third ribs. The upper slip is very broad, and springs from the lower border of the second rib. The fibres diverge to form a thin muscular sheet, which is inserted into the an- terior lip of the vertebral border of the scapula, between the insertions of the upper and lower portions. Sometimes this part of the muscle is not directly attached to the bone, but to a strengthened band of the fascia covering the subscapularis. {c) The lower part is formed by the remain- ing digitations of the muscle. These converge to form a thick mass, which is inserted into a rough surface upon the deep aspect of the inferior angle of the scapula. The deep surface of the serratus magnus is in contact with the chest wall. Removal of the Arm from the Body.â€”Draw the arm forcibly from the side and cut through the serratus magnus, the omo-hyoid, and the latissimus dorsi muscles, also the suprascapular artery and nerve, and the vessels and nerves in relation to the trapezius and rhomboids, if these have not been previously divided. The arm will then be found to be free, and it may be carried to one of the tables which are reserved for the dissection of separate parts.

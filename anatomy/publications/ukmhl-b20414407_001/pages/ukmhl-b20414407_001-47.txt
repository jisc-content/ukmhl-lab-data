PECTORAL REGION AND AXILLARY SPACE, 21 Do not attempt to secure the two highest lateral cutaneous nerves (/.(?., those issuing from the second and third intercostal spaces) in the meantime. They are best dissected along with the other contents of the axillary space. Dissection.—If the subject be a female the dissector should endeavour to make out the connections, and also something of the structure of the mammary gland. The small area of skin which has been left over the areola, should be raised towards the summit of the nipple, and bristles Fig. 5.—The Mammary Gland of a young woman who died during parturition. The dissection shows the trabe- cular arrangement of the connective tissue, the lobules, and the milk-ducts, with their dilatations or ampullae. may be introduced through the external orifices which will be seen on its surface. Further, by removing the fat which surrounds the organ, the true glandular tissue will be rendered more apparent, although it is only in favourable circumstances that the milk-ducts in the nipple and their ampullse in the region of the areola can be isolated and rendered apparent. If the subject be a young female the senior student is recommended to conduct the dissection in the following manner :—Remove the gland with the skin and superficial fascia which cover it, and, after dissecting

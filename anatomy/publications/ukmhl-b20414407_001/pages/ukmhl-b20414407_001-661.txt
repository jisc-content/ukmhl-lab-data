PEL VIS. 625 layers of the broad ligament include between them other structures, viz.—(i.) the parovarium ; (2.) the uteri?ie and ovarian vessels, nerves, and lymphatics. The part of the broad ligament which extends from the upper end of the ovary to the iliac fossa in the neighbour- hood of the external iliac vessels receives the special name of the ovariopelvic ligament, or the suspensory ligament of the ovary. It contains between its two layers the ovarian vessels and nerves. Recto-Vaginal Pouch, or the Pouch of Douglas.—This corresponds with the recto-vesical pouch in the male. In front, it is bounded by the peritoneum clothing the vagina and uterus ; behifid, by the membrane investing the rectum ; whilst, on each side, it is limited by a semilunar fold of peri- toneum which proceeds forwards from the side of the rectum to the side of the uterus. Some importance is attached to the fact that this pouch is slightly deeper on the left than upon the right side. The Utero-vesical Pouch is much shallower than the preceding. It is placed between the uterus and the bladder, and it is limited laterally by two slight antero- posterior folds of peritoneum, termed the utero-vesical folds, which pass between these viscera. False Ligaments of the Bladder and Uterus.—The false ligaments of the bladder are fve in number, viz., one superior, two lateral, and two posterior. The tivo posterior false ligaments of the bladder are the utero-vesical folds, which extend between the uterus and bladder, and limit the utero-vesical pouch laterally. The superior false ligament is that portion of the peri- toneum which passes from the apex of the bladder on to the posterior wall of the abdomen. It is led away from the viscus by the urachus and the two impervious hypogastric arteries. The lateral false ligament is the term applied to the peri- toneum as it passes from each side of the bladder to the wall of the pelvis and the iliac fossa. This reflection has VOL. I.—4:0

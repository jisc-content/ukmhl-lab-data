38o ABDOMEN. difference in the external organs of generation, there is a shght modification. It presents the same two layers. In the superficial fatty layer, where it covers the labia majora, there are dartos fibres similar to those in the scrotum of the male. The deeper layer has the same attachments as in the male, viz., to the anterior lips of the pubic arch, and to the base of the triangular ligament; but it is not so mem- branaceous, and consequently does not form so distinct a stratum. The two fascial pouches are also present in the female, and are sometimes spoken of as the vulvo-scrotal sacs. Their separation along the middle line is not due to the interposition of a median septum, as in the male, but to the presence of the uro-genital fissure. Rectal Triangle. Nothing need be added to what has already been written regarding this portion of the perineal space in the male. In both sexes the steps of the dissection and the parts found are precisely the same {vide p. 352). Urethral Trl^ngle. Superficial Perineal Vessels and Nerves.—Under this heading we include two arteries and three nerves, viz.:— A j'teries. ( The superficial perineal artery. I The transverse perineal artery. ^■The posterior superficial perineal nerve. No'ves. \ The anterior superficial perineal nerve. I The long pudendal nerve. They have precisely the same disposition as the corre- sponding vessels and nerves in the male, with this exception, that they are somewhat smaller, and are distributed to the labium majus, instead of to the scrotum. P'or a detailed description of these structures, the student may refer to p. 358.

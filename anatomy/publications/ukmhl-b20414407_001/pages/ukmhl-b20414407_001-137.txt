FOREARM AND HAND. Ill takes origin from the adjacent part of the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane. A rounded tendon issues from the fleshy belly, and proceeds into the palm, under cover of the anterior annular ligament. In many cases the flexor longus pollicis will be observed to have an additional slender head of origin, from the inner side of the coronoid process of the ulna, or the internal condyle of the humerus. The Pronator Quadratus takes origin from the anterior surface of the ulna in its lower fourth, and is inserted into the front aspect of the lower end of the radius. The Anterior Interosseous Artery has been seen to arise from the common interosseous. It runs downwards upon the front of the interosseous membrane, in the interval between the flexor longus pollicis and the flexor profundus digitorum. At the upper border of the pronator quadratus it pierces the interosseous membrane, and gains the posterior aspect of the limb. It supplies muscular twigs to the three deep muscles with which it is in contact. In addition to these it gives off the following branches :— 1. Median. 2. Medullary. 3. Anterior communicating. The median artery is a long delicate vessel, which accom- panies the median nerve. The medullary arteries are two in number—one for the radius, the other for the ulna. They enter the nutrient foramina of these bones. The anterior communicating is a slender artery, which runs down- wards, behind the pronator quadratus, to join the anterior carpal arch. The Anterior Interosseous Nerve is a branch of the median, and accompanies the artery of the same name. It does not follow it, however, through the interosseous mem- brane, but is distributed entirely upon the front of the limb. It is the nerve of supply for the flexor longus pollicis, the

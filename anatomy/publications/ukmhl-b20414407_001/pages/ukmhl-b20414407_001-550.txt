ABDOMEN. 514 sphincter pylori muscle. If the mucous membrane be removed from the fold, the thick band of fibres which forms the sphincter becomes very apparent. This dissection had best be done under water. When the sphincter of the pylorus is tightly contracted, the pyloric opening, viewed from the duodenal side, presents a striking resemblance to the os uteri externum. Coats of the Duodenum.—In connection with the duo- denum, note that the valvulse conniventes begin about one or two inches beyond the pylorus, about the commencement of its second part; that the mucous membrane is covered by villi; and that usually no Peyer's patches are to be seen. Pass a probe along the bile duct, and another along the Fig. iio.—Peritoneum and muscular coats removed from the pylorus and upper part of duodenum to show the constriction and Brunner's glands. (From Gegenbaur.) pancreatic duct. These ducts will then be observed to pierce the coats of the duodenum, side by side, very obliquely, and to open by a common orifice, which is placed on the summit of a papillary projection of mucous membrane. The duodenum should now be pinned down with its mucous surface undermost to the bottom of a cork-lined tray filled with water. Its coats may then be dissected. They are in all respects similar to those already examined in connection with the jejunum (p. 488). If the dissection is carried on until the deep surface of the submucous coat is exposed by the removal of the entire muscular coat, a view of Brunner's glands may be obtained. They appear as whitish specks, about the PYLORUS

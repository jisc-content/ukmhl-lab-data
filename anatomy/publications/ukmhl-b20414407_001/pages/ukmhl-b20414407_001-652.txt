6i6 ABDOMEN. it is inserted into the inner lip of the iliac crest at the posterior part of the iliac fossa. The amphiarthrodial joint, between the body of the last lumbar vertebra and the base of the sacrum, corresponds in every respect with the similar articulations above, between the bodies of the vertebrae. The opposed bony surfaces are each coated by a thin layer of hyahne cartilage, and are firmly united by an intervening disc of fibro-cartilage, which is dense and laminated externally, soft and pulpy towards the centre. The dissector should observe that this disc is the thickest of the series, and further, that it is wedge-shaped, being thicker in front than behind. Sacro-coccygeal Articulation.—This is an amphiarthrodial joint. The articulating surfaces are each covered by a thin cartilaginous plate, and these are united by a disc of fibro- cartilage. The joint is strengthened in front by an antenor ligament, which extends downwards from the front of the sacrum to the anterior aspect of the coccyx, and by a pos- terior ligament which, attached above to the posterior border of the lower aperture of the sacral canal, proceeds down- wards upon the posterior aspect of the coccyx. The latter Hgament is much the stronger of the two. In addition, fibrous bands will also be found passing between the cornua of the sacrum and the coccyx, and also between the lateral angles of the sacrum and the transverse processes of the first piece of the coccyx. As regards the coccygeal joints (when such exist), the union of the diiferent segments of the bone is brought about by intervening cartilaginous discs and anterior and posterior ligaments. Dissection.—The student should now saw through the sacrum and coccyx in the mesial plane. By this proceeding he will obtain a view of the structure of the intervertebral discs, and at the same time be enabled to make out to better advantage the attachments of the posterior common vertebral ligament and of the ligamenta subflava.

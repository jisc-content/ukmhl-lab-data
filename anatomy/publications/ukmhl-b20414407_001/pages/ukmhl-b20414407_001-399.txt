MALE PERINEUM. 371 triangular ligament, about half-an-inch below the symphysis pubis, it accompanies the dorsal artery of the penis. At the root of the penis it supplies one or two twigs to the corpus cavernosum. The dissection of the perineum is now completed, but whilst the body is in the lithotomy position, and the various parts of the perineum exposed, the student should consider what structures still cover the perineal aspect of the prostate gland. Three layers would still require to be removed to bring the prostate into view—viz. (i.) the compressor urethrae muscle; (2.) the parietal pelvic fascia or the deep layer of the triangular ligament; (3.) the anterior fibres of the levator ani muscle. Such being the case, it will be apparent that within the limits of the urethral triangle, and dissecting from the surface towards the prostate gland, we meet with an alternation of 7nuscular and fascial strata, viz. :— 1. The fascia of Colles. 2. Superficialpei-ineal muscles. 3. Triangular ligament. 4. Compressor urethra: muscle. 5. Parietal pelvic fascia or deep layer of triangular ligament. 6. Levator ani muscle. 7. Capsule of prostate. Further, the fasciae of the urethral triangle are so arranged that they form a superficial and a deep com- partment, and within one or other of these all the structures of this division of the perineum are contained (Fig. 71, P- 370)- The superficial compartment is bounded in firont by the fascia of Colles, behind by the triangular ligament, laterally by the attachment of these to the margins of the pubic arch, and inferiorly by the blending of the fascia of Colles with the base of the triangular ligament. For the contents of this compartment see p. 350, Fig. 71. The deep co7?ipartment is the interval between the

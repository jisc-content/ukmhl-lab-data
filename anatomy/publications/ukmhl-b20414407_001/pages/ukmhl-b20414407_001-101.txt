FRONT OF THE ARM. 75 limb, but it gradually, as it descends, inclines outwards so as to lie finally in front of the arm. This change of direction must be borne in mind when pressure is applied to the vessel, with the view of controlling the flow of blood within it. Thus, above, the pressure must be directed in an outward and backward direction, so that it may be caught between the fingers and the bone ; whilst below, the pressure must be applied in a back- ward direction. Throughout its whole length, the brachial artery is super- ficial : in other words, in order to expose the vessel the skin biceps. cephalic vein. brachialis anticus. musculo-spiral nerve & superior profunda humerus. [vessels. triceps. Fig. 22.â€”Transverse section through the right upper arm about its middle. At this level it will be seen that the brachial artery and the median nerve lie in a deep furrow on the inner side of the limb bounded by the biceps, triceps, and brachialis anticus, reminding one somewhat of Hunter's canal in the lower limb. and fascia alone would require to be removed. The inner margins of the coraco-brachialis and the biceps muscles, however, which lie along its outer side, overlap it to a con- siderable extent, and finally, in the anticubital fossa, it sinks deeply in the interval between the supinator longus on the outside, and the pronator radii teres on the inside. The extent to which the brachial artery is overlapped by the biceps may be seen in the accompanying woodcut (Fig. 22).

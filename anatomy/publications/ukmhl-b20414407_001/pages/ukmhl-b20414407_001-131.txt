FOREARM AND HAND. 105 fascia immediately above the wrist, and then proceeds downwards in front of the annular ligament to join the strong palmar fascia of the hand. Very frequently it gives a slip to the abductor pollicis muscle. The Flexor Carpi Ulnaris arises by two heads. One of these is incorporated with the common origin from the humeral condyle; the other springs from the inner aspect of the olecranon process of the ulna, and likewise from the posterior border of the same bone in its upper two thirds, by an aponeurotic attachment. Fibres are also derived from the investing fascia and the intermuscular septum on its outer side. The two heads of origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris bridge across the interval between the internal condyle of the humerus and the olecranon process, and between them the ulnar nerve is prolonged down- wards into the forearm. The tendon appears upon the anterior border of the muscle, and is inserted into the pisiform bone. The Flexor Sublimis Digitorum receives this name from its being placed upon the superficial aspect of the flexor profundus. For the most part it lies deeper than the other superficial muscles (Fig. 25.) It is a powerful muscle which arises from the internal condyle of the humerus by the common tendon, but it also takes origin from the internal lateral ligament of the elbow-joint, from the inner margin of the coronoid process of the ulna, the front of the radius, and the fascial intermuscular septa in relation to it. The radial head of origin is a thin fleshy stratum which is attached to the oblique line of the radius and the anterior border of that bone for a variable distance below the insertion of the pronator radii teres. Four tendons issue from the fleshy mass. These enter the palm by pass- ing under cover of the anterior annular ligament, and go to the four inner digits. Their insertions will be seen later on, but in the meantime note that at the wrist and for a short distance above it they are enveloped by the

It may be noted that the outer edge of the erector spinae usually corre- sponds with the bare posterior surface of the colon at this level (Fig. 97). The sigmoid flexure extends from the crest of the iHum to the brim of the true pelvis, where it becomes continuous with the rectum at a point corresponding to the left sacro- iliac articulation. It forms a long single loop of intestine, w^hich is bound to the left iliac fossa by an extensive fold of ureter.

The sigmoid flexure may, therefore, be defined as being that part of the great gut which is attached to the wall of the false pelvis; whilst the rectum is that part of the bowel which is fixed to the posterior wall of the true pelvis. The subdivision is somewhat arbitrary, seeing that the sigmoid meso-colon runs

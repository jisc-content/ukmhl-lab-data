570 ABDOMEN. continuous with the same layer of the other side. The rectum is thus enclosed in a sheath formed by the recto- vesical and rectal layers of the pelvic fascia. Proceeding forwards to the region of the prostate and the neck of the bladder, the connections of the three layers will be found to be somewhat altered. Substitute the prostate for the bladder, and carry the vesical layer over it, so as to meet its fellow of the opposite side, and the arrangement will be understood (Fig. 130). The prostate is thus enclosed in a capsule, the walls of which are exceedingly strong and dense. But at this point the lower part of the Fig. 130. rectum passes backwards to reach the surface, and as it does so it pushes itself through the rectal layer, and carries downwards upon its walls a thin tubular prolongation of the rectal layer of the fascia (Fig. 131). The arrangement of the visceral pelvic fascia in front of the pelvis must next be studied. The student has already noted that here the visceral layer has a direct attachment to the posterior aspect of the body of the pubic bone a short distance above the lower end of the symphysis, and above the bony origin of the anterior fibres of the levator ani, and the attachment of the parietal pelvic fascia.

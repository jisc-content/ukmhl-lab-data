THE LOWER LIMB. I go the rectus femoris occupies a groove situated just above the upper margin of the acetabulum. It is partially concealed by some fibres of the capsular ligament, which are prolonged upwards over it. It should be cleaned by repeatedly draw- ing the point of the knife over it in a direction parallel to its fibres. Before the muscles on the back of the thigh are disturbed, it is well to dissect the popliteal space. In this way the boundaries of the space are maintained in position during our examination of the structures which lie within it. During the dissection of the popliteal space the following structures are brought into view :— 1. Superficial fascia. 2. External saphenous vein. 3. Small sciatic nerve. 4. Popliteal fascia. 6. The internal and external popliteal nerves and their branches. 7. The popliteal artery and vein and their branches. 8. A few lymphatic glands. 9. A slender branch from the obturator nerve. 10. The popliteus muscle. Surface Anatomy.—The space which lies immediately above the knee-joint, and between the hamstring muscles, is termed the ham. It is depressed when the knee is flexed, but forms a slight prominence when the joint is fully extended. The outer hamstring is formed by the biceps muscle, the inner by the tendons of the semimembranosus and semitendinosus. The last-named tendon can be easily felt through the skin, as it lies on the superficial surface of POPLITEAL SPACE. 5. Muscles which bound the space. r Biceps. Semitendinosus. Semimembranosus. Gastrocnemius. -Plantaris.

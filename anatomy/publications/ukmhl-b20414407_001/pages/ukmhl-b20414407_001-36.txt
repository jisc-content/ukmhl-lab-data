THE UPPER LIMB. lO tendon, into the bottom of the bicipital groove of the humerus. This insertion cannot be studied at present, but will be seen later on (p. 55). With the teres major muscle, the latissimus dorsi forms the posterior fold of the axilla. At first placed on the dorsal aspect of the teres major, the latissimus dorsi is folded round its lower border, and finally at its insertion comes to lie in front of it.

A triangular space mapped out by the lower border of the trapezius, the upper border of the latissimus dorsi, and the base of the scapula, will now be noticed (Fig. 2). Within these limits a small portion of the rhomboideus major will be seen, and also a varying amount of the chest wall—

PECTORAL REGION AND AXILLARY SPACE. 23 ferous ducts again contract and run forwards in its substance towards its summit, upon which they open. In a well-injected subject, twigs from the intercostal arteries, and also from the perforating branches of the internal mammary, may be traced into the mammary gland, and another vessel, called the external mammary artery^ may be seen winding round the edge of the greater pectoral muscle, or piercing its lower fibres to reach the gland. By means of lymphatic vessels the mammary gland is brought into connection with the sternal glands, and also more directly with the axillary glands. The latter connec- tion is one of much importance to the surgeon in cases where it is necessary to remove the organ for malignant disease. In the male the mammia is extremely rudimentary. The nipple is small and pointed, and the areola is surrounded by sparse hairs. The Deep Fascia of the pectoral region is a thin mem- brane which closely invests the pectoralis major. It is attached superiorly to the clavicle, and is firmly connected in the middle line to the front of the sternum. Below, it is continuous with the deep fascia covering the abdo- minal muscles. Its strongest fibres are directed outwards, parallel to the clavicle, and, at the lower border of the great pectoral muscle, it is continuous with the axillary fascia. At the infraclavicular fossa a process from its deep surface dips in to join the costo-coracoid mem- brane, whilst, beyond this, it becomes continuous with the fascia covering the deltoid muscle. The axillary fascia and the costo-coracoid membrane will be separately described later on. Dissection.â€”The pectoralis major muscle must now be cleaned, and its division into sternal and clavicular parts clearly made out. The muscular fibres are rendered tense by abducting the arm from the side. On the right side the dissector begins at the lower border of the muscle, whilst on the left side he commences at the upper border. Clean also

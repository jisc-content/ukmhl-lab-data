The lowest arch lies on the tibia im- mediately above its tubercle, and results from the anasto- mosis of the recurrent tibial and inferior internal articular arteries. The upper and middle of these transverse arches are connected, on each side of the patella, by ascending and descending branches, which anastomose with one an- other, and thus enclose the patella in an irregularly quad- rilateral arterial framework.

Six arteries therefore take part in the formation of this system of anastomoses, on the front and lateral aspects of the joint, viz., the deep branch of the anasto- motica, the superior and inferior articular branches of the popliteal and the anterior recurrent branch of the anterior tibial. In addition to the twigs which proceed from these to form the arterial arches, numerous branches are given

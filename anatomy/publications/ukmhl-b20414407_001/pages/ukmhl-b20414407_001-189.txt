Certain accessory ligaments are therefore provided, which anchor the pisiform firmly in its place. These consist of two strong ligamentous bands which pass from its lower surface to the hook of the unciform bone, and to the base of the fifth metacarpal bone. Additional security is frequently given by bands which connect it with the bases of the fourth and third metacarpal bones. First Row of Carpal Bones.—Tivo dorsal^ two palmar, and two interosseous ligaments pass transversely from the semi- lunar to the scaphoid and cuneiform bones which lie on either side of it. The two interosseous ligaments are composed of short stout fibres which pass between the non-articular portions of the opposed surfaces of the three bones. They are readily seen from above, where they complete the carpal surface of the radio-carpal joint. The Second Row of Carpal Bones.— Three palmar, three dorsal, and three interosseous ligaments pass transversely between the adjacent bones. The interosseous ligament between the os magnum and unciform is very powerful and strong; that between the os magnum and trapezoid is weak, and sometimes absent. At the present moment the interosseous ligaments are hidden from view, but they can be studied when the transverse carpal joint between the two rows of bones is opened. Transverse Carpal Joint (between the two rows of carpal bones).—Two lateral ligaments, which pass between the scaphoid and trapezium on the outer side, and the cunei- form and unciform bones on the inner side, together with a series of palmar and dorsal bands, and one interosseous liga- ment, connect the two rows of carpal bones together. The palmar ligaments show a tendency to converge upon the OS magnum, whilst the dorsal ligaments are very irregular. The interosseous liga7nent is placed between the os magnum and scaphoid bones, but is not always present.

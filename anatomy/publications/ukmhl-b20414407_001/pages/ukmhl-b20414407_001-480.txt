4SO ABDOMEN. lumbar region. The accompanying diagram shows the extent of the parts of the liver which occupy these regions of the abdominal cavity when the hollow viscera in its vicinity are empty. The liver has the shape of a right-angled triangular prism (Symington), but its substance is so pliant that its natural configuration can only be preserved when special measures are adopted for this purpose. It presents five surfaces, viz., a superior, an anterior, an inferior, a posterior, and a right lateral surface. For the most part, these Fig. 93.â€”Diagram which shows the exact portions of the liver in the different sections of the costal zone. R.P. Right mid-Poupart plane. M.P. Mesial plane. L.P.

A sharp attenuated margin, however, separates the inferior surface from the right lateral, from the anterior, and, at the left extremity of the organ, from the superior surface. This margin constitutes a prominent feature of the liver. At the present moment, with the organ in situ, the con- nections of the liver are such that the posterior surface cannot be studied at all, and the inferior surface only partially. The other three surfaces and the sharp margin

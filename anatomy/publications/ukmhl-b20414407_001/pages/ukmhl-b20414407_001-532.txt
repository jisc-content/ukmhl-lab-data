ABDOMEN. 496 The branches of the coronary artery are :— 1. CKsophageal. 2. Gastric. The (esophageal arteries (rami oesophagei) spring from the coronary at the point where it reaches the stomach. They pass upwards upon the posterior aspect of the gullet, through the. oesophageal opening of the diaphragm, and anastomose with the oesophageal branches of the thoracic aorta. The gastric branches take origin from the coronary as it runs along the lesser curvature of the stomach, and are dis- tributed to both surfaces of this viscus. The Coronary Vein lies by the side of the artery of the same name. It passes from right to left along the lesser curvature of the stomach. Reaching the oesophagus it turns to the right and joins the portal vein. The Hepatic Artery (arteria hepatica), intermediate in size between the coronary and splenic, at first takes a transverse course to the right. At the pyloric end of the stomach it changes its direction, and, turning forwards below the fora- men of Winslow, ascends between the two layers of the gastro- hepatic omentum. Near the transverse fissure of the liver it ends by dividing into right and left hepatic arteries. The hepatic artery is accompanied by numerous large nervous twigs derived from the coeliac plexus, and, as it passes upwards to the liver, it is in close relationship with the bile duct and the portal vein. The duct lies upon the right side of the artery, and the vein lies behind both. (Figs. 99 and 105.) The following are the branches of the hepatic artery :— I. Pyloric. pyloric (arteria gastrica sinistra) is a small artery which springs from the hepatic at the pylorus, and then runs from 2. Gastro-duodenal. Sviperior pancreatico-duodenal. Right gastro-epiploic.

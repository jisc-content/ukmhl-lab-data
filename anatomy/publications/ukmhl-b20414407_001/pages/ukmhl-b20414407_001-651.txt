615 PEL VIS, co77imon ligametit is prolonged downwards ^vithin the spinal canal, over the posterior aspect of the body of the last lumbar vertebra, to the upper part of that portion of the sacrum which forms the anterior wall of the sacral canal. Ltgamenta subflava are also present. These are two short bands of yellow elastic tissue placed one on each side of the mesial plane. Superiorly they are attached to the anterior aspect of the lower borders of the laminae of the last lumbar vertebra; whilst inferiorly they are fixed to the posterior aspect of the upper margins of the laminae of the first sacral segment. An i7iterspinous ligament connects the lower border of the spinous process of the last lumbar vertebra with the upper border of the spinous process of the first sacral vertebra. A supraspinous ligament bridges across between the ex- tremities of the same spinous processes. So far, then, the ligaments of the lumbo-sacral articulations are identical with those which, above the level of the sacrum, bind the several segments of the spinal column together. Two additional ligamentsâ€”viz., the lumbo-sacral and the ilio-lumbar, must now be examined. The lumbo-sacral liganmit is the representative of the superior costo-transverse ligaments. It is a strong triangular fibrous band attached by its apex to the tip and low^er border of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra. Expanding as it proceeds downwards, it is fixed below to the posterior part of the base of the sacrum, where some of its fibres intermingle with those of the sacro-iliac ligaments. The ilio-lumbar ligament may be considered to be a thickened and specially developed part of the anterior lamella of the lumbar fascia. It lies in the same plane and is directly continuous with it. It is triangular in shape, and is fixed by its apex to the tip of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra. Proceeding horizontally outwards.

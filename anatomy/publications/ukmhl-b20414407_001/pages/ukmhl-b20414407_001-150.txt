124 THE UPPER LIMB. ulnar artery and nerve find their way into the palm by pass- ing in front of the ligament, and a strong slip of fascia which bridges over these may be looked upon as an accessory attachment of the ligament, seeing that it springs from the pisiform bone and tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and joins the front of the annular ligament beyond the artery and nerve. The tunnel which the anterior annular ligament forms with the palmar concavity of the carpus is transversely oval in shape, and below it opens into the middle compartment of the palm. Through it pass the tendons of the flexor sublimis, the flexor profundus digitorum, the tendon of the flexor longus poUicis, and the median nerve. The relation of the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis to the annular liga- ment is peculiar. It pierces the outer attachment of the ligament, and proceeds down in the groove of the trapezium in a special compartment provided with a special synovial sheath. Synovial Sheaths of the Flexor Tendons.â€”As the flexor tendons and the median nerve pass through the carpal tunnel they are enveloped by two synovial sheaths, which at the same time line the walls of the canal, and thus greatly facilitate the free play of the tendons behind the anterior annular ligament. As we have stated, these sheaths are two in number. One is wrapped around the tendon of the flexor longus poUicis; the other invests the tendons of the flexor profundus and flexor sublimis. Both are prolonged upwards into the forearm for an inch or more, and both are carried downwards into the palm in the form of diverticula upon the diverging tendons. The diverticula in relation to the tendons which go to the index, middle, and ring fingers, end near the middle of the palm. Those upon the tendons of the thumb and little finger, however, are prolonged down- wards into these digits, and line the flexor sheaths which confine the tendons upon the palmar aspects of the phalanges.

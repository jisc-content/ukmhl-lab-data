THE LOWER LIMB. 214 the fascia lata. Through this aperture it passes to join the femoral vein. In its course along the thigh it receives several tributaries. Two of these are of large size, viz., an anterior branchy which collects the blood from the front and outer aspects of the limb, and a posterior branch, which performs a similar office for the posterior and inner aspects of the thigh. They both enter the internal saphenous vein near its termination. In addition to these, the three small veins corresponding to the superficial inguinal arteries converge towards the saphenous opening, and join the saphenous trunk as it disappears through it. Cutaneous Nerves.—The cutaneous nerves are now to be looked for in the superficial fascia. The main stems are six in number, and are derived from two sources. Three come directly from the liwibar plexus, and three are branches of the anterior crural nerve:— {Ilio-inguinal. Crural branch of genito-crural. External cutaneous. ( Middle cutaneous. From anterior crural, \ Internal cutaneous. I Long saphenous. The ilio-inguinal ?ierve will be found as it escapes from the external abdominal ring in company with the spermatic cord. Its branches go for the most part to the scrotum, but some are distributed to the skin on the upper and inner side of the thigh. The crural branch of the genito-crural nerve pierces the fascia a little way below Poupart's ligament, and to the outer side of the femoral artery. With a little care a communica- tion between this nerve and the middle cutaneous may be made out. It supplies a limited area of skin on the upper part of the front of the thigh. The external cutaneous is distributed on the outer aspect of the thigh. It pierces the deep fascia in two parts. Of

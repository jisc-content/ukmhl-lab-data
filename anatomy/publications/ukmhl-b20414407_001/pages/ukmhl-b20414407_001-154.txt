128 THE UPPER LIMB. then they diverge, to be inserted into the borders of the shaft of the second phalanx.^ By this arrangement the flattened tendon of the flexor subhmis forms a ring, through which the tendon of the flexor profundus is allowed to pass onwards to the base of the ungual phalanx, into which it is inserted. In each of the four fingers the same condition is found; the tendon of the flexor sublimis is inserted by two slips into the sides of the second phalanx, whilst the tendon of the flexor pro- fundus is inserted into the anterior aspect of the base of the terminal phalanx. Tendon of the Flexor Longus PoUicis.—This tendon proceeds downwards in the interval between two of the muscles of the thumb (viz., the superficial head of the flexor brevis pollicis, and the adductor obliquus pollicis), and also in the interval between the two sesamoid bones ^ Where the margins of the two slips of the tendon of the flexor sublimis are united behind the tendon of the flexor profundus, a decussation of fibres takes place between the two slips, which greatly strengthens the insertion. 1 Fig. 30.—Flexor tendons of the finger, with the vincula accessoria.

POPLITEAL SPACE 195 Below, the space is bounded by the converging heads of the gastrocnemius. In the formation of the lower and outer boundary, the outer head of the gastrocnemius will be seen to be assisted by the small plantaris 7?iusde. The diamond-shaped space on the back of the knee-joint, which is brought into view by dissection, differs widely from the condition which is observed when transverse sections are made through this part of the frozen limb. Before the integuments and fasciae are removed all the patellar bursa. iynovial cavity of knee-joint. nternal pop- liteal N. external pop- liteal N.

The space in this condition is rather under an inch wide at its broadest part. The popliteal artery, therefore, which traverses the space, is covered by muscles throughout its whole course, with the exception of a very small part immediately above the knee-joint.

THE LOWER LIMB. 294 is inserted into the tubercle of the scaphoid, and also by a number of slips into certain of the tarsal and metatarsal bones. These will be dissected later on. Peroneal Artery.—This vessel may now be traced down- wards as it runs along the fibula under cover of the flexor longus hallucis. It is accompanied by two vence comiies. About an inch or an inch and a-half above the ankle-joint it ends by dividing into its two terminal branches—the anterior and the posterior peroneal arteries. Fig. 55.—Diagrammatic representation of the fascia of the Leg. The fascia of the tibialis posticus is more a muscular aponeurosis than a true fascial septum; but it is convenient for descriptive purposes to regard it as one of the partitions. In addition to these it gives off— 1. Muscular branches. 2. The nutrient artery to the fibula. 3. The communicating artery. The muscular branches supply the muscles around it. The nutrient artery enters the nutrient foramen on the posterior surface of the fibula. The communicating arte7y arises a short distance above the ankle-joint, and runs

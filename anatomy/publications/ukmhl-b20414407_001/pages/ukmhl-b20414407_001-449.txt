ABDOMINAL WALL. 419 part's ligament, and the outer border of the rectus. This receives the name of the triangle of Hesselbach. The floor of the space is formed by the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, and chiefly by that part of it which is composed of the conjoined tendon. In the female the inguinal canal is much smaller than in the male. It has the same boundaries, and it is traversed by the round ligament of the uterus. Arteries of the Abdominal Wall.—In the abdominal wall we find the following arteries :— 1. The intercostal and lumbar arteries. 2. The deep epigastric. 3. The deep circumflex iliac. 4. The superior epigastric. 5. The musculo-phrenic. The intercostal arteries of the three lower spaces are pro- longed forwards between the internal oblique and the trans- versalis. They have already been noted accompanying the corresponding nerves. In front they anastomose with the epigastric arteries, whilst inferiorly they effect com- munications with the lumbar arteries. The abdominal branches of the lumbar arteries ramify between the same two muscles as the preceding vessels, but at a lower level in the abdominal wall. Anteriorly they anastomose with the deep epigastric artery; above with the intercostal arteries; and below with the deep circumflex iHac and the ilio-lumbar. The Deep Epigastric Artery (arteria epigastrica inferior), a branch of the external iliac, is a vessel of some size, and takes origin about a quarter of an inch above Poupart's ligament. At present it is seen shining through the fascia transversalis and forming the outer boundary of Hesselbach's triangle. Divide the fascia transversalis along its course and it will be observed to be accompanied by two veins. Study the course and relations of this vessel. At first it runs in-

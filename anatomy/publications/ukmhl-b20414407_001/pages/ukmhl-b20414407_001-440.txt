ABDOMEN. muscles blend to form the conjoined tendon. It is through the medium of this tendon that the transversalis gains its insertion into the pubic crest and into the ilio-pectineal line. The aponeurosis of the transversalis constitutes the greater portion of the conjoined tendon—indeed, whereas the in- ternal oblique aponeurosis has an attachment to the ilio- pectineal line of little more than half-an-inch, the aponeurosis of the transversalis is fixed to fully an inch of this line. Above the level of the conjoined tendon the aponeurosis of the transversalis is inserted into the linea alba, but in passing inwards to this insertion it presents two different relations to the rectus muscle. Down to a point midway between the umbilicus and pubes it passes behind the rectus, and blends with the posterior lamella of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique. Below this point it passes ifi front of the rectus, and blends with the aponeuroses of the internal oblique and external oblique. Dissection.—The sheath of the rectus should now be opened on both sides of the body by a vertical incision along the middle line of the muscle. The divided anterior lamella should then be carefully raised from the surface of the muscle and turned outwards and inwards. At the line^e transversse this can only be done with difficulty, so close is the connection between the sheath and the tendinous intersections of the muscle. Contents of the Sheath of the Rectus.—Within the rectal sheath we find the following structures :— 1. The rectus muscle. 2. The pyramidalis muscle. 3. The terminal portions of the six lower intercostal nerves, and the last dorsal nerve. 4. The deep epigastric artery. 5. The superior epigastric artery. In cleaning the rectus keep in mind the intercostal nerves and the last dorsal nerve. These will now be seen to enter the sheath and sink into the rectus. After supplying it with

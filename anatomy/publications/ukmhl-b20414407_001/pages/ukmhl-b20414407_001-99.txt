73 FRONT OF THE ARM. The inter?ial iniermusciclar septu7n is the stronger and more distinct of the two. It is attached to the internal supracondyloid ridge, and may be followed upwards as high as the insertion of the coraco-brachialis muscle. The external intermuscular septum is fixed to the external supra- condyloid ridge, and extends up the arm as high as the insertion of the deltoid. The dissector should note that these septa divide the upper arm into an anterior and a posterior osteo-fascial compartment. Fig. 21.—Transverse section through the lower third of the right upper arm. H. Humerus. Structures in the Anterior Compartment.—The anterior osteo-fascial compartment of the upper arm has been opened into by the reflection of the front part of the brachial aponeurosis. The three muscles which specially belong to this region are the biceps, brachialis anticus, and the coraco-brachialis. The biceps is the most superficial muscle: under cover of it, and closely applied to the anterior aspect of the humerus, is the brachialis anticus; whilst the coraco-brachialis is the slender muscular belly which Hes along the inner side of the biceps in its upper

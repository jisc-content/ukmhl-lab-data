THE UPPER LIMB. i6o In the inferior radio-ulnar joint the synovial membrane is remarkable for its laxity. It is called the membrana sac- ciformis., and extends upwards in the form of a loose sac for some distance between the radius and ulna. The synovial cavity is also prolonged inwards in a horizontal direction between the lower end of the ulna and the tri- angular fibro-cartilage. Sometimes the triangular fibro-cartilage is perforated; and when this is the case, the inferior radio-ulnar joint- cavity communicates with the cavity of the radio-carpal joint. The Interosseous Membrane is a fibrous membrane which is stretched across the interval between the two bones of the forearm, and is attached to the interosseous border of each. Superiorly it is deficient. Its upper border does not reach higher than a point about an inch below the tubercle of the radius. The fibres which com- pose it run for the most part obliquely downwards and inwards from the radius to the ulna, although several slips may be noticed taking an opposite direction. The pos- terior interosseous vessels pass backwards between the two bones of the forearm immediately above its upper margin, whilst the terminal branch of the anterior inter- osseous artery pierces it about one and a half inches above its lower end. This ligament, in addition to bracing the two bones together, extends the surface of origin for the muscles of the forearm. By its anterior surface it gives origin to the flexor profundus and the flexor longus pollicis muscles, whilst by its posterior surface it contributes fibres to the three extensor muscles of the thumb and to the extensor indicis. The OblicLue Ligament is a weak slip which springs from the outer part of the coronoid process of the ulna, and extends obliquely downwards and outwards to find an attachment to the radius immediately below its bicipital tubercle. It crosses the open space between the bones of

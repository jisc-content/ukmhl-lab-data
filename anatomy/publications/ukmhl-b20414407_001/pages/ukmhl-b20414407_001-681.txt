64s PEL VIS. an upper part, which occupies the body, and a lower or cervical part, which occupies the cervix. The upperportiofi is the larger of the two, and is triangular in form. The anterior and posterior walls are in contact with each other, and the sides of the triangle are incurved, the base being directed upwards. At the two extremities of the base are the constricted openings of the Fallopian tubes. The lower cervical portion is fusiform or spindle-shaped in form, being also slightly compressed from before back- wards. Above, it is somewhat constricted, and at the junction of the body with the cervix of the uterus it becomes continuous with the upper triangular part of the cavity. This narrow opening is termed the os uteri internum. Below, the cavity of the uterus opens into the vagina at the OS uteri externum. Mucous Membrane of the Uterus.—The dissector will not fail to note a striking difference between the mucous lining of the uterus in the triangular cavity of the body and in the fusiform cavity of the cervix. In the former it is smooth and even, and tightly bound down to the subjacent muscular tissue. In the cervix it presents a remarkable disposition, which, from its appearance, has been termed the arbor vitce. This consists of a series of prominent folds or rugce arranged in a definite manner. Thus, there is an anterior and posterior median fold or raphe, and from this secondary folds branch off and pass obliquely upwards and outwards. The arbor vitse is more marked upon the anterior than upon the posterior wall. The student should look between the folds of the arbor vitae for ovula Nabothi. These are minute vesicles filled with a yellowish liquid. They are merely follicles distended with mucus. Fallopian Tubes.—The Fallopian tube has an external serous, an intermediate muscular, and an internal mucous coat. The aperture by which it opens into the uterus is

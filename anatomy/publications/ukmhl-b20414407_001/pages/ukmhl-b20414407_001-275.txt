247 INNER SIDE OF THE THIGH. The ligamentmn pateHce, which connects the patella with the anterior tubercle of the tibia, and through which the quadriceps is attached to that bone, will be studied in con- nection with the knee-joint. The group of adductor muscles on the inner aspect of the thigh, together with the blood vessels and nerves associated with them, must next be dissected. In this dissection the following are the structures which are dis- played :— Pectineus. Adductor longus. Adductor brevis. Adductor magnus. Gracilis. Obturator externus. r Profunda femoris and its branches. The adductor muscles are disposed in three strata. The superficial stratum is formed by the adductor longus and the pectineus, which lie in the same plane. Above they are placed side by side, but below, as they approach their insertions, they are separated from each other by an interval. The second stratum is formed by the adductor brevis; and the third, or deep layer, by the adductor magnus. The gracilis muscle, also an adductor, extends along the inner aspect of the thigh. It is a long, strap-like muscle, applied against the adductor brevis and adductor magnus. Inter- posed between these muscular layers, and affording a means of separating the one from the other, are the two divisions of the obturator nerve. The anterior division is placed between the superficial and middle layers, whilst the INNER SIDE OF THE THIGH. Obturator. The two divisions of the obturator. Occasionally the accessory obturator.

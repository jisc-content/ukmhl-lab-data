219 FRONT OF THE THIGH. saphenous opening. Externally, it is continuous with the falciform edge of the iliac portion of the fascia; internally, it blends with the front of the pubic portion. In the neighbourhood of the knee the fascia lata is continuous behind with the popliteal fascia, whilst on the lateral and front aspects of the joint it is attached to the various bony prominences and to the different tendons in this locality. Here it helps to strengthen and support the capsular ligament of the knee-joint. Intermuscular Septa.—But the fascia lata has other offices Fig. 42.—Diagram to show the arrangement of the three intermuscular septa and the three osteo-fascial compart- ments of the thigh.

From every part of its deep surface processes pass off which penetrate the limb and constitute sheaths for the muscles and other structures which compose it. Three of these are especially strong, and form distinct septa or partitions which reach the femur and are attached to the linea aspera on its posterior aspect. These parti- tions are termed the intermuscular septa, and are so disposed that they intervene between the three great groups of muscles in this region. The external mtermuscular septum

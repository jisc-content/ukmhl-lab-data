211 FRONT OF THE THIGH. cribriform fascia (a thin fascial layer, which is spread over the saphenous opening), and runs inwards and upwards across the spermatic cord. It supplies the skin of the scrotum and penis. The superficial epigastric turns upwards and leaves the thigh by crossing Poupart's ligament about its middle. It is dis- tributed chiefly to the skin on the front of the abdomen. The superficial circumfiex iliac is very minute, and courses upwards and outwards along Poupart's ligament towards the anterior superior spine of the ilium. The veins which accompany these arteries converge towards the saphenous opening and join the internal saphenous vein near its termination. Lymphatic Glands and Vessels.^—The disposition of the lymphatic glands into two groups will now be evident—an upper inguifial group along the line of Poupart's ligament, and a lower femoral group, which extends for a short way down the thigh along the line of the internal saphenous vein. In a spare subject, or better still, in a dropsical subject, the general arrangement of the lymphatic vessels may also be made out. To the femoral group of glands proceed the vessels of the lower limb; to the inguinal glands go the lymphatic vessels from the genitals, perineum, and the surface of the abdomen. These are termed the afferent vessels. In addition to these, numerous vessels pass between the various glands and connect them with each other. The lymphatic vessels which lead the lymph away from the glands are called the efferent vessels. A large number of these pass through the saphenous opening, others pierce the deep fascia. They join the glands which lie in relation to the femoral and external iliac arteries. Dissection.—It requires an experienced dissector to display in a satis- factory manner the saphenous opening, or, in other words, the aperture in the deep fascia through which the saphenous vein passes to join the femoral vein. Begin by removing the lymphatic glands. In doing this

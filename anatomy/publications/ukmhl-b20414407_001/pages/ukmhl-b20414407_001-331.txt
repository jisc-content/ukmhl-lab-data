SOLE OF THE FOOT. 303 relations are as follows:—(i) it is placed between the abductor hallucis and the hollow of the os calcis; (2) it lies between the flexor brevis digitorum and the musculus acces- sorius; (3) it occupies the interval between the flexor brevis digitorum and the abductor minimi digiti. In this latter situation it is near the surface, and is merely covered by the integument and fasciae. The branches which proceed from this part of the vessel .^G AHO SHORT .XT.;,3^^ nOBSAL With ^^2.

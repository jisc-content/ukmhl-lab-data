THE LOWER LIMB. 268 position during the action of the muscles. Two of these may be examined at this stage, viz., the anterior and the external annular ligaments. The anterior annular ligavmit consists of two portions— an upper and a lower. The upper part is a strong, broad band which stretches across the front of the leg imme- diately above the ankle-joint. By one extremity it is attached to the fibula, and by the other to the tibia. The loiver part is placed over the ankle-joint. Externally it Fig. 50.—Diagrammatic representation of the fascia of the Leg. The fascia of the tibialis posticus is more a muscular aponeurosis than a true fascial septum; but it is convenient for descriptive purposes to regard it as one of the partitions. presents the appearance of a narrow, well-defined band, which is fixed firmly to the anterior part of the os calcis. As this is traced inwards it will be observed to divide into two diverging limbs. Of these the upper is attached to the inner malleolus, whilst the lower passes to the inner margin of the foot, and becomes connected with the plantar fascia. The different parts of the anterior an- nular ligament are continuous with the deep fascia, but

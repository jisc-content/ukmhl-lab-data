587 PEL VIS. from the anterior aspect of the rectum on to the back of the bladder; or, in other words, the bottom of the recto- vesical cul-de-sac of peritoneum. This line, taken in con- Pro state. Reflection of peritoneum. junction with the converging vasa deferentia and vesiculse seminales, maps off a triangular space upon the base of the bladder—the apex of which is at the base of the prostate, whilst the base is formed by the reflection of the peritoneum. Within the limits of this triangle the base of the bladder is separated from the rectum by the recto-vesical layer of pelvic fascia alone. It occasionally happens that in retention of urine, it is impossible to pass a catheter into the bladder to relieve the distension. In these cases it becomes necessary to puncture the bladder with a trocar and cannula. The foregoing facts concerning the relations of this viscus will show that the operation may be performed at two points without injury to the peritoneum—viz. (i) in the middle line immediately above the pubic symphysis ; (2) through the rectum and within the limits of the small triangular space on the base of the bladder. In the distended condition of the bladder, the peritoneum is absent from its walls at both of these points. The middle line must be adhered to rigorously in both methods. Dissection,—The blood vessels of the pelvis should now be followed out. For this purpose it is necessary to remove the stuffing from the rectum, and allow the air to escape from the bladder. The peritoneum upon the left side and the loose tissue around the vessels must be dis- sected away. Accompanying the arteries the dissector should notice

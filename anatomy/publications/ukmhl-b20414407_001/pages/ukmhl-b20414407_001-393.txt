MALE PERINEUM. 365 of the triangular ligament looks downwards and forwards, whilst its deep surface looks upwards and backwards to- wards the cavity of the pelvis. In close contact with its superficial surface are the parts which constitute the root of the penis, viz., the bulb and the two crura and the muscles which are associated with them, also the transversus perinei muscles. The structures which are in relation to its deep surface will be studied when it is reflected. The triangular ligament is not an unbroken continuous layer of fascia. It is pierced—(i.) by the urethra; (2.) by Fig. 70.—Diagram of the triangular ligament. The in- ferior layer or true triangular ligament is represented as having been removed on the left side. T.

Superior or deep layer of the triangular ligament. the pudic arteries; (3.) by the dorsal nerves of the penis; (4.) by the arteries to the bulb; (5.) and lastly, at its base, where it blends with the superficial fascia, by the superficial perineal vessels and nerves. The aperture for the urethra is situated in the middle line, one inch below the symphysis pubis. It is not a clean cut hole with sharp edges. The margins of the opening are prolonged over the bulb of the penis so as to form for it an aponeurotic capsule. As soon as the urethra gains the superficial aspect of the ligament, it pudic artery and dorsal nerve of the penis artery to the bulb. of

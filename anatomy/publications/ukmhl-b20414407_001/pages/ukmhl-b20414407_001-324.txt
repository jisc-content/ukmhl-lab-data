THE LOWER LIMB. 296 Internal Annular Ligament.—The connections of this thickened band of deep fascia should be carefully studied, and also the arrangement of the structures which pass under cover of it into the sole of the foot. It bridges across the hollow between the prominence of the os calcis and the internal malleolus, and it is attached to both. Above, it is chiefly connected with that layer of the deep fascia which intervenes between the superficial and deep muscles on the back of the leg, but it is also continuous with the general aponeurotic investment of the limb. In- feriorly, its lower margin gives origin to the abductor hallucis, and is connected with the inner portion of the plantar fascia. Passing under cover of this ligament the dissector will observe—{a) the posterior tibial vessels and nerve; {b) to the outer side of these, the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis; ic) to their inner side, the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum and tibialis posticus. From within out- wards these structures lie in the following order: 1. Tendon of tibialis posticus. 2. Tendon of flexor longus digitorum. 3. Posterior tibial vessels. 4. Posterior tibial nerve. 5. Tendon of flexor longus hallucis. The tendons are isolated from each other and from the vessels and nerve by septa, which pass from the deep sur- face of the ligament to ridges on the bones. These septa can be demonstrated by slitting up the ligament, for a short distance, in the line of each of the tendons : each of the three sheaths will then be seen to be lined by a glistening synovial membrane. Anastomosis around the Ankle-joint.—The dissector should next satisfy himself with regard to the anastomosis of arteries which takes place around the ankle-joint. On the outer aspect of the joint he will observe inosculations taking place between branches of the following arteries:—

FOREARM AND HAND. 119 is followed from the inner to the outer side of the hand it will be seen to rest upon—{a) the anterior annular liga- ment ; {b) the short muscles of the little finger; {c) the flexor tendons and the digital branches of the median nerve. Branches of the Superficial Palmar Arch. — Small branches proceed from the superficial palmar arch for the supply of the integument and adjoining short muscles of the palm. As the ulnar artery leaves the surface of the anterior annular ligament it gives off its profunda brcmch; whilst from the convexity of the arch proceed four digital branches. The profunda artery is a small vessel, which at once dis- appears from view by passing backwards in the interval between the abductor minimi digiti and the flexor brevis minimi digiti. It will be traced to its termination in the deep dissection of the palm. The four digital arteries form the palmar collateral branches for both sides of each of the three inner fingers and for the ulnar side of the index finger. The first digital artery runs downwards upon the short muscles of the little finger, to which it gives twigs, and then it is carried along the ulnar side of the little finger. The second digital artery proceeds towards the interval between the roots of the little and ring fingers, and divides into two branches {collateral arteries)., which run along the contiguous sides of these digits. The third digital artery supplies in like manner the adjacent sides of the ring and middle fingers; whilst the fourth digital artery deals similarly with the contiguous margins of the middle and index fingers. There are certain points in connection with these digital arteries, during their course in the palm and along the sides of the fingers, which must be noted. In the palm the un- divided trunks lie in the intervals between the flexor tendons and in front of the digital nerves and the lumbrical muscles. Along the sides of the fngers they show a different relation

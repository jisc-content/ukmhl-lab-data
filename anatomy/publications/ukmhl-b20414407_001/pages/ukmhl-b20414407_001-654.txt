6i8 ABDOMEN. The great sacro-sciatic ligament has a wide attachment to the posterior inferior iliac spine and to the side of the sacrum and coccyx. Narrowing considerably as it proceeds downwards and forwards, it again expands, and is inserted into the inner border of the tuberosity of the ischium. From this it sends upwards a sharp falciform edge, which extends forwards for a short distance upon the ascending ramus of the ischium, and gives attachment to the parietal pelvic fascia. It should be noticed that at its ischial attachment, some of its fibres pass continuously into the tendon of the biceps muscle. The small sacro-sciatic ligament is triangular in form. By its base it is fixed to the side of the sacrum and coccyx in front of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, the fibres of both mingling together; by its apex it is attached to the spine of the ischium. The pelvic surface of this ligament presents an extremely intimate connection with the coccygeus muscle \ indeed, it is generally believed that the ligament is derived from the superficial part of the muscle by the fibrous degeneration of its fasciculi. The two sacro-sciatic ligaments convert the sciatic notches of the innominate bone into foramina. Through the great sacro-sciatic foramen pass the gluteal vessels and superior gluteal nerve, the pyriformis muscle, the sciatic vessels and nerves, the inferior gluteal nerve, the internal pudic vessels and nerve, the nerve to the obturator internus, and the nerve to the quadratus femoris. The small sacro-sciatic foramen transmits the obturator internus muscle, the pudic vessels and nerve, and the nerve to the obturator internus. A synovial cavity is present in the sacro-iliac joint. The ligaments of the joint should now be divided, and the two bones forcibly wrenched asunder. By this proceeding each articular surface will be seen to be covered with a plate of cartilage, between which a small synovial space may be observed, which partially separates them.

ABDOMINAL WALL. 409 vertebrae at the roots of the transverse processes, and the intermediate lamella to the tips and adjacent sides of the transverse processes. Two aponeurotic compartments are thus formed, the posterior of which is occupied by the erector spinae, whilst in the anterior is placed the quadratus lumborum. These are points which cannot be demonstrated in this dissection, but a reference to Fig. 81 will help the student to understand the arrangement. Anteriorly the fibres of the transversalis muscle end in a latissimus dorsi. serratus post. inf. Fig. 81.—The dotted line represents the peritoneum. Strong aponeurosis, which is inserted into the linea alba, the pubic crest, and the ilio-pectineal line. Towards this aponeurosis the fleshy fibres for the most part run in a transverse direction. The lower fibres, however, take a curved course downwards and inwards, so that the muscle presents an arched lower margin. The dissector has already seen that the lower portions of the aponeuroses of the internal oblique and the transversalis >

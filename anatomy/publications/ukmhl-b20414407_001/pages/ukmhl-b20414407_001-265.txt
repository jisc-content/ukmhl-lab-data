237 FRONT OF THE THIGH. Lower Portion of the Femoral Artery.—The entire length of the femoral artery is now exposed. Below the apex of Scarpa's triangle it enters Hunter's canal, and is separated from the surface by the fibrous expansion which closes the canal, the sartorius muscle, the fascia lata, and the integu- ment. The long saphenous nerve at first lies to the outer side of this portion of the vessel and then in front of it. From above downwards the artery rests upon the pectineus, external cutaneous nerve. crureus. vastus profunda great sciatic semitendinosus. semimembranosus. Fig. 47.—Transverse section through the middle of the thigh. The relationship of the parts in Hunter's canal is seen. the adductor brevis, the adductor longus, and the adductor magnus. In its upper part, however, it is separated from these muscles by the femoral vein, which lies behind it; lower down, the vein, which inclines outwards, comes to lie on its outer side. The relation of parts in the lower portion of Hunter's canal is seen in Figs. 46 and 47. The two vessels are placed side by side, whilst the long saphenous nerve is in front of the artery.

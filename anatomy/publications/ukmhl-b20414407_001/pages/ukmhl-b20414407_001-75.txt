SHOULDER—SCAPULAR REGLON. 49 as the insertion of the deltoid. Commence in front and proceed from before backwards, taking care to leave the fatty superficial fascia in its place. Cutaneous Nerves.—In the superficial fascia, which is thus laid bare, cutaneous nerves from two different sources must be secured and traced, in order that the area of skin supplied by each may be recognised. They are :— 1. Supra-acromial branches from the third and fourth cervical nerves. 2. Cutaneous branches from the circumflex nerve. The supra-acromial branches have already been observed crossing the outer third of the clavicle and the insertion of the trapezius under cover of the platysma. They have been divided in removing the limb. If the cut ends be secured and followed, they will be found to spread out over the outer and back part of the upper portion of the deltoid region. The cuta?ieous branches of the circumflex nerve consist— ia) of a large branch w^hich turns round the posterior border of the deltoid muscle, and {b) of several fine filaments from the same source, which pierce the substance of the deltoid muscle, and appear at irregular intervals on its surface. The latter are difficult to secure, but the main branch can be easily found by carefully dividing the superficial fascia along the posterior border of the deltoid. On everting this border very little dissection is required to expose the nerve hooking round it about two and a half inches above the deltoid insertion. It breaks up into branches which supply the skin over the lower portion of the deltoid region. Deep Fascia.—A firm but thin fascia covers the sub- scapularis muscle. Into this some of the fibres of the serratus magnus will usually be found inserted at the vertebral border of the scapula. The strongest and most conspicuous fascia in this region is that which covers the exposed part of the infraspinatus muscle. It is firmly VOL. I.—4

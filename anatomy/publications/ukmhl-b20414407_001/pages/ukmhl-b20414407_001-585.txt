549 ABDOMIXAL CAVITY. is in great part covered by the inferior vena cava, and on both sides the lumbar vessels pass outwards behind it. As a general rule, a small oval ganghon is formed upon the body of each lumbar vertebra. An external and an in- terjial series of branches will be observed to spring from rhese ganglia. The external bra?ic/ies connect the ganglia with the anterior primary divisions of the lumbar spinal nerves. Two will be found accompanying each lumbar artery. Trace them carefully backwards by cutting through the fibrous arches which bridge over these vessels, and scraping away the fibres of the psoas muscle. They join the lumbar nerv es close to the inten-ertebral foramina. The internal bra?iches are chiefly given to the aortic plexus, but some will be found passing downwards in firont of the common iliac artery to join the hypogastric plexus. Several twigs are also given to the venebne and their ligaments. Di3s-:::i:n.—To brirLg :he ajiterior primary divisions of the lumbar nerves into view, it is necessary to scrape away the psoas musde. This has aheady been partially done in following the coimecting sympa- thetic twigs backwards. An occasional branch, the accessory obturator^ is Uable to injury tmless it be secured at once, WTien present, ir will be found descending along the ir^zer c rrier o: the vs::i^. Lumbar Nerves.—The anterior primary divisions of the lumbar nerv es are five in number, and pass outwards in the substance of the psoas muscle. They increase in size from above downwards, and each nerve is joined by two twigs from the sympathetic cord. Branches are given by them to the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles. The first three lumbar nerves, with a part of the fourth^ unite in a loop-like manner to form the lumbar plexus, whilst the remaining part of the fourth joins the f:ft?L to form the lu77iho-sacral cord. Lumbar Plexus.—This plexus is placed in front of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrre in the substance

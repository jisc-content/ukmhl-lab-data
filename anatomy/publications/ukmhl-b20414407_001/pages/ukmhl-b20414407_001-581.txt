ABDOMINAL CAVITY. 545 about an inch in length, which receives by its lower end several large lymphatic vessels, whilst superiorly, it contracts and becomes the thoracic duct. Near its upper end it is joined anteriorly by the lacteal vessels. The vena azygos major lies along its right side, but the receptaculum chyli is easily distinguished from this by the whiteness of its walls. The thoracic duct enters the thorax by passing through the aortic opening of the diaphragm. Azygos Veins.—The right azygos vein or ve?ia azygos major usually takes origin in the right ascending lumbar vein. It will be found in the interval between the right crus of the diaphragm and the aorta, upon the right side of the receptaculum chyli, and it will be noticed to enter the thorax by passing through the aortic opening of the diaphragm. The vena azygos minor inferior is more difficult to discover. It originates on the left side of the spine, in the left ascending lumbar vein, and enters the thorax by piercing the left crus of the diaphragm. Fascia and Muscles on the Posterior Wall OF THE Abdomen. The muscles on the posterior wall of the abdomen are three in number, viz. (i.) The psoas, an elongated fleshy mass extending downwards on the side of the spine; (2.) The quadratus himboriim, a quadrate muscle external to the psoas, and stretching between the crest of the ilium and the last rib; (3.) The iliacus, situated in the iliac fossa. The fascia which covers these muscles must, in the first place, be studied. Quadratus Lumborum Fascia.—Follow this inwards and it will be found to be attached to the anterior aspect of the roots of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. Trace it outwards and it will be noticed to join the posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis muscle. From VOL. I.—35

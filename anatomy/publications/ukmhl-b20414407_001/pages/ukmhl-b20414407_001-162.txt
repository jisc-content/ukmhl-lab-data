136 THE UPPER LIMB. Back and Outer Border of the Forearm. The cutaneous nerves and vessels in this region have already been studied. The parts which still require to be examined are :— 1. The deep fascia. 2. The supinator and extensor muscles. 3. The posterior interosseous artery. 4. The perforating or terminal branch of the anterior inter- osseous artery. 5. The posterior interosseous nerve. Deep Fascia.—The deep fascia on the posterior aspect of the forearm is stronger than that which clothes it in front. At the elbow it is firmly attached to the condyles of the humerus and the olecranon process, and it receives a rein- forcement of fibres from the tendon of the triceps muscle. Here also it affords origin to the extensor muscles, and sends strong septa between them. At the wrist a thickened band—the posterior annular ligafuent—is developed in con- nection with it. This can readily be distinguished from the thinner portions of the fascia with which it is continuous above and below, and it will be observed to stretch obliquely from the styloid process of the radius inwards and down- wards across the wrist to the inner side of the carpus. Dissection.—The deep fascia should now be removed, but that portion of it near the elbow, which gives origin to the subjacent muscles, should be left in place. The posterior annular ligament should also be arti- ficially separated from it, and retained in situ. Superficial Muscles.—The muscles in this region consist of a superficial and a deep group. The superficial muscles., as we proceed from the outer to the inner border of the forearm, are: — the supinator longus, the extensor carpi radialis longior, the extensor carpi radialis brevior, the extensor communis digitorum, the extensor minimi digiti, the extensor carpi ulnaris, and the anconeus.

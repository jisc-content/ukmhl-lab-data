88 THE UPPER LIMB. arm close to the outer margin of the external intermuscular septum (p. 65). The muscular branches go to the three heads of the triceps, to the anconeus, to the brachialis anticus, to the supinator longus, and to the extensor carpi radialis longior. The branches to the three last muscles spring from the main trunk after it has pierced the external intermuscular septum. The branch to the inner head of the triceps is sometimes termed the ulnar collateral nerve. It is a long slender filament, which runs downwards to supply the lower fibres of the inner head of the triceps, and it receives this name from the close manner in which it is applied to the ulnar nerve in the lower part of its course. The branch to the a?iconeus is also a long slender twig, which enters the substance of the internal head of the triceps, and appears at first sight to terminate there, but, if traced downwards, it will be found to end in the anconeus. Superior Profunda Artery.—This artery has been already observed to take origin from the brachial trunk, immedi- ately below the lower margin of the teres major muscle. It accompanies the musculo-spiral nerve, and its relations to the three heads of the triceps and the musculo-spiral groove of the humerus are exactly the same as those of the nerve (p. 87). When it reaches the external intermuscular septum, at the outer side of the arm, it ends by dividing into two terminal branches—an anterior and a posterior. The anterior and smaller branch accompanies the musculo- spiral nerve through the septum, and follows it downwards to the anterior aspect of the external condyle of the humerus, where it anastomoses with the radial recurrent artery. The posterior larger branch proceeds downwards on the posterior surface of the external intermuscular septum, and anastomoses on the back of the external condyle of the humerus with the posterior interosseous recurrent artery. The branches which proceed from the superior profunda

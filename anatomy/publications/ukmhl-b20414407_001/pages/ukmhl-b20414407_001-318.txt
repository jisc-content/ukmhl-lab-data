290 THE LOWER LIMB. of the tibia, and is merely covered by the integument, two layers of fascia, and lower down by the internal annular ligament. From above downwards it rests upon the tibialis posticus, the flexor longus digitorum, the tibia, and the posterior aspect of the ankle-joint. Throughout its entire course the posterior tibial artery is closely accompanied by two vena comites. The posterior tibial nerve is at first on its inner side, but it soon crosses the vessel, and then proceeds down on its outer side. The following are the branches which issue from the posterior tibial artery :â€” 1. Muscular. 4. Cutaneous. 2. Nutrient. 5. Internal calcanean. 3. Peroneal. 6. Communicating. The muscular branches supply the deep muscles on the back of the leg, and one or two of large size enter the soleus. The cutaneous branches are given to the skin on the inner aspect of the leg. The nutrient artery springs from the posterior tibial close to its origin, and after giving some twigs to muscles enters the nutrient foramen of the tibia. It is remarkable on account of its large size. The communicating branch is given off about an inch above the lower end of the tibia. It passes transversely outwards under cover of the flexor longus hallucis, and joins the peroneal artery. The internal calcanean branch pierces the internal annular ligament, and accompanies the nerve of the same name to the skin of the heel and the sole. The peroneal artery is a large branch which proceeds from the posterior tibial about one inch or so below its origin. In the present stage of the dissection it is seen running obliquely downwards and outwards upon the tibialis posticus to reach the fibula. It is covered by the

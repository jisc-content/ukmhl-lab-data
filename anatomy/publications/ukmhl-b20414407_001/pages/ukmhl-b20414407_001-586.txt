ABDOMEN. 550 of the psoas. Above, it is usually connected with the last dorsal nerve by a small twig which descends in the substance of the quadratus lumborum to the first lumbar nerve; below, it is brought into communication with the sacral plexus by the branch of the fourth nerve, which enters into the forma- tion of the lumbo-sacral cord. The following are the branches which proceed from the lumbar plexus :â€”- derived from 1st lumbar nerve. 1. Ilio-hypogastric, \ 2. Ilio-inguinal, J 3. Genito-crural, ,, ist and 2nd lumbar nerves. 4. External cutaneous, 2nd and 3rd lumbar nerves. 5. Obturator, ,, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th lumbar nerves. 6. Anterior crural, ,, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th lumbar nerves. The manner in which these nerves spring from the plexus must be carefully studied. The first lumbar trunk breaks up into four branches, viz., the ilio-hypogastric, the ilio- inguinal, the upper root of the genito-crural, and a communicating branch to the second lumbar nerve. The seco?id, third, and fourth lumbar trunks each divide into an anterior and a posterior division. The three anterior divisions are smaller than the others, and they unite to form the obturator nerve; the three large posterior divisions unite to form the anterior crural nerve. But other branches come off from certain of these divisions. Thus, the lower root of the genito-crural springs from the anterior division of the second lumbar nerve, whilst the two roots of the external cutaneous nerve take origin from the posterior divisions of the second and third lumbar trunks. The ilio-hypogastric nerve emerges from the outer border of the psoas, and crosses the quadratus lumborum obliquely. Reaching the crest of the ilium, it leaves the abdomen by piercing the transversahs muscle. Its further course has already been studied (p. 407). It is distributed by an iliac branch to the skin of the gluteal region, and by a hypogastric bra?ich to the skin over the lower part of the abdominal wall.

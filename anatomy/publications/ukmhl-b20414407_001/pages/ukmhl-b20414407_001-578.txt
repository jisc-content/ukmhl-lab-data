542 abdomen: The liwibar vei?is join the inferior vena cava, and those of the left side pass behind the aorta. Vena Cava Inferior.—This is the large vein which collects, by means of its tributaries, the venous blood from the lower limbs, the abdominal viscera, and a great part of the abdominal parietes. It is formed on the right side of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra by the union of the two common iliac veins. As it ascends, it lies in the first place upon the vertebral column, close to the right side of the aorta ; above the level of the second lumbar vertebra it lies upon the fleshy part of the right crus of the diaphragm, which intervenes between it and the aorta; lastly, it is con- tained in a deep groove, on the posterior surface of the liver, and leaves the abdomen by passing through the vena caval opening of the diaphragm, to open into the right auricle of the heart. As it passes upwards it receives the following tribu- taries :— 1. The common iliac veins. 2. The lumbar veins. 3. The right spermatic or ovarian vein. 4. The renal veins. 5. The right middle capsular vein. 6. The inferior phrenic veins. 7. The hepatic veins. The Common Iliac Arteries and Veins.—The two terminal branches of the aorta should next be examined. They arise upon the left side of the body of fourth lumbar vertebra, and, diverging from each other, proceed downwards and outwards upon the vertebral column. After a course of about two inches, each vessel ends opposite the lumbo- sacral articulation by dividing into the external and i7iternal iliac arteries; of these the former is the larger of the two, and appears to be the continuation of the parent trunk, whilst the latter passes downwards into the pelvis. The common iliac artery of each side is covered by peritoneum, and overlapped by coils of the small intestine ;

82 THE UPPER LIMB. have already been removed, and consist of skin, superficial fascia, and deep fascia. In connection with the latter is the semilunar fascia, whilst within the superficial fascia are the median-basilic and median-cephalic veins, the anterior division of the internal cutaneous nerve and the cutaneous part of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. These structures constitute the coverings of the space. lymphatic gland internal cutaneous nerve median nerve anterior ulnar recurrent artery ulnar artery • B. Biceps. S.

Pronator radii teres. Fig. 23.—Dissection of the anticubital fossa. The space is triangular. Its base is directed upwards, and is usually regarded as being formed by a line drawn between the two condyles of the humerus. Its inner boundary is the pronator radii teres, and its outer boundary the supinator longus. The meeting of these two muscles

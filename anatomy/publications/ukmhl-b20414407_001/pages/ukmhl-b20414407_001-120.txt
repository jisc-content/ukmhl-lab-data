THE UPPER LIMB. 94 Glenoid Ligament.^—The glenoid ligament is the dense fibro-cartilaginous band which surrounds the margin of the glenoid cavity of the scapula, and is attached to its rim. It deepens, and at the same time serves to extend, the articular socket of the scapula. The intimate connection which it presents with the capsule of the joint can now be studied. Two tendons are also closely associated with it, viz., the long head of the triceps below, and the long head of the biceps above. The Long Head of the Biceps is an important factor in the construction of the shoulder-joint. Entering the cap- sule through the opening between the two tuberosities of the humerus, it is prolonged over the head of the bone to the top of the glenoid cavity. Its insertion at this point should now be examined. It will be seen to divide into three portions, viz., a large intermediate part, which obtains direct attachment to the scapula, and two smaller lateral parts, which diverge from each other and blend with the glenoid ligament. The long head of the biceps, by its position within the capsule, and in the deep groove between the tuberosities of the humerus, serves to keep the head of the bone in place, and to steady it in the various movements at the shoulder-joint. Synovial Membrane.—The synovial membrane lines the interior of the capsular ligament, and is reflected from it upon the anatomical neck of the humerus as far as the articular margin of the head of the bone. The bursal protrusion of the synovial membrane {bursa subscapularis) under the tendon of the subscapularis muscle has already been noticed. The tendon of the biceps, as it traverses the joint, is enveloped in a tubular sheath of the membrane, which bulges out through the opening of the capsule in the form of a bursa, which lines the bicipital groove, and receives the name of bursa intertubercularis. The Articular Surfaces of the bones should now be examined. The smooth, glistening articular cartilage, which

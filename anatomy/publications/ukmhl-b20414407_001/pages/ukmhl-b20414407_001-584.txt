548 ABDOMEN. the tendinous arches which bridge over the lumbar arteries and protect these vessels from the pressure of the contracting muscle. The psoas tapers somewhat as it extends downwards along the brim of the pelvis, and a tendon appears on its outer border, which affords attachment to the fibres of the iliacus. Passing behind Poupart's ligament, it is inserted into the small trochanter of the femur.^ The Iliacus.—This muscle arises from the upper part of the iliac fossa, the anterior ilio-sacral ligament, and the base of the sacrum. It is inserted into the tendon of the psoas magnus. Some of its fibres, however, have a separate inser- tion into an impression below the small trochanter of the femur. Nerves on the Posterior Wall of the Abdomen. The nerves on the posterior wall of the abdomen are the gangliated cord of the sympathetic and the anterior primary divisions of the spinal nerves, with the branches which proceed from them. These should now be dissected. Gangliated Cord of the Sympathetic.—This enters the abdomen behind the ligamentum arcuatum internum, and extends downwards upon the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae along the anterior border of the psoas muscle. Above, it is continuous with the thoracic portion of the cord, whilst below, it passes behind the common iliac artery and enters the pelvis. In the thorax, it is placed upon the heads of the ribs; here, however, it lies nearer the middle line, being carried forward by the psoas muscle. On the right side, it ^ Another muscle, called the psoas parvus, is occasionally present. This springs from the bodies of the last dorsal and first Imiibar vertebrre, and the intervertebral disc between them, and, stretching downwards upon the anterior and inner aspect of the psoas magnus, it ends in a tendon which is inserted into the ilio-pectineal eminence and ilio- pectineal line.

ABDOMEN. 346 deal with a diamond-shaped space, and that it has the following boundaries : in front, the symphysis pubis and the subpubic ligament; behind, the coccyx; and on each side from before backwards, the rami of the pubis and ischium, the tuberosity of the ischium and the great sacro-sciatic ligament. If he now turns his attention to the subject before him he can readily identify these limits. The great sacro-sciatic ligament, however, is somewhat obscured, from its being covered by the gluteus maximus muscle, but it can Fig. 63.—Outlet of pelvis. be felt by pressing deeply in a line between the ischial tuberosity and the coccyx. In the undissected body the superficial area of the perineum is very limited; indeed, w^hen the limbs are ex- tended and approximated, it merely consists of a narrow groove running forwards between the thighs from the coccyx towards the pubis. In this groove are placed the anus or orifice of the rectum and the roots of the scrotum and penis, whilst in the middle line a cutaneous ridge—the median raphe—may be observed. This raphe can be traced from the anus forwards over the scrotum and along the under surface of the penis.

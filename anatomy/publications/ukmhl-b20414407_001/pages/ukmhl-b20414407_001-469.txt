It is consequently mainly the duty of the student who is engaged in the dissection of the lower limb, and within whose domain the femoral sheath lies, to in- vestigate the anatomical connections of this variety of hernia (p. 227). Still it is essential that the dissector of the abdomen shovild examine, from its abdominal aspect, the crtiral ring or aperture of communication be- tween the crural canal and the abdominal cavity, and give the dissector of the lower limb an opportunity of doing so likewise. The crural ring is placed immediately behind Poupart's ligament, in T.V. T.V. Fig. 90.â€”Diagram to illustrate the four different varie- ties of infantile hernia. (After Lockwood.) A.

If the peritoneum is still in position at this point it may exhibit a slight digital depression as it passes over the ring. Strip the peritoneum from the greater part of the iliac fossa.

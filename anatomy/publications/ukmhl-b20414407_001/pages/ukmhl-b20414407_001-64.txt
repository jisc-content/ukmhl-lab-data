THE UPPER LIMB. 38 from the subscapularis muscle by a quantity of areolo-fatty tissue. The third and longest part of the axillary artery is superficial in its lower half. This is due to the fact that the posterior wall of the axilla extends lower down than the anterior wall. Whilst, therefore, it is covered in its upper half by the pectoralis major, below this it is only covered by the integument and fasciae. Behind it rests, from above downwards, on the subscapularis, the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, and the lower margin of the teres major. To its outer side is the coraco-brachialis; whilst to its inner side is the axillary vein. The brachial nerve- cords have now given place to their large branches, and these are disposed around the vessel. The precise positions which they occupy in the undisturbed condition of parts, and when the arm is abducted from the side, has been already described on page 33. The Branches of the Axillary Artery have been observed at different stages of the dissection. They may now be more fully examined. They are :â€” Superior thoracic, . . from the first part. Thoracic axis, from the second part. |- from the third part. Long thoracic, Alar thoracic, Subscapular-, . Anterior circumflex, Posterior circumflex, The Superior Thoracic Artery {a. thoracica suprema) is a small branch which springs from the axillary at the lower border of the subclavius muscle and ramifies upon the upper part of the inner wall of the axilla. It supplies twigs to the serratus magnus muscle, the intercostal muscles, and the pectoral muscles. The Thoracic Axis or Acromiothoracic Artery is a short wide trunk, which is usually described as arising from the first part of the axillary artery. As a rule, however, it takes origin under cover of the pectoralis minor, and winds

THE LEG. 265 9. Anterior peroneal artery. 10. Anterior tibial nerve. 11. Recurrent articular branch from the external popliteal nerve. 12. Extensor brevis digitorum. 13. Dorsalis pedis artery. Anterior Tibio-Fibular Region—Dorsum of Foot. The anterior tibio-fibular region should be dissected first, and it is usual to conjoin with this the dissection of the dorsum of the foot. The following parts are exposed in this region. 1. Superficial veins. I 8. Anterior tibial vessels. 2. Cutaneous nerves. 3. Deep fascia, with its inter- muscular septa, and annular ligaments. 4. Tibialis anticus. 5. Extensor longus digitorum. 6. Peroneus tertius. 7. Extensor longus hallucis. Reflection of Skin.—To place the limb in a convenient position for the dissection of this region, a block should be introduced beneath the knee, and the foot should be extended and fastened firmly to the table by means of hooks. The skin should be reflected from the tibial andregions at the same time. Incisions:—(i) a vertical cut along the middle line of the leg and dorsum of the foot to the base of the middle toe ; (2) a transverse incision across the ankle-joint; (3) a transverse incision across the dorsum of the foot at the roots of the toes. The four flaps of skin thus mapped out must now be raised from the subjacent fatty tissue, and the superficial veins and nerves dissected out. Superficial Veins.—The venous arch on the dorsum of the foot, which receives the digital veins, should in the first place be dissected. From the inner extremity of this arch the internal saphenous vein will be seen to take origin, whilst from its outer end the external saphenous vein pro- ceeds. Trace these vessels upwards. The former will be found to pass in front of the internal malleolus, whilst the latter ascends behind the external malleolus. Each is asso- ciated with the nerve which bears its own name. Cutaneous Nerves.—The following are the cutaneous nerves which must be secured in this dissection:—

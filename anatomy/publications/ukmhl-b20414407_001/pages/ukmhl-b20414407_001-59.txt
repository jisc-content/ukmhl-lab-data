The lowest subscapular net've must now be looked for upon the surface of the subscapularis muscle. Axillary Artery.—It is the third part of the axillary artery which is now exposed, and the vein will be seen to lie upon its inner side, and also partly in front of it. It is important to note the position of the large nerves, with reference to the artery, before they are much disturbed by the dissection. circumflex outer head of median musculo-cutaneous median internal cutaneous musculo-spira inner head of median. intercosto-humeral nerve of Wrisberg. ulnar. internal cutaneous.

The 72erve of JVrisberg {the lesser i?iter?ial cutaneous nerve) is also internal to the artery, but is separated from it by the axillary vein, to which it is closely applied. The internal cutaneous nerve, and the inner head of the median, lie in front of the artery; the inusculo-spiral and circumflex nerves are directly behind it; while the ?Jiedian and musculo-cutaneous nerves are placed upon its outer side.

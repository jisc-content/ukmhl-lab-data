483 ABDOMINAL CAVITY. arches, and so on, until three, four, or perhaps even five tiers of arterial arcades are produced. From the lowest arches a multitude of minute twigs pass directly to the wall of the intestine. The colic branches (arterise colicse) spring from the con- cavity or right side of the superior mesenteric artery. The ileo-colic artery (arteria ileo-colica), the lowest of the three branches which go to the great intestine, proceeds downwards, between the two layers of the mesentery, to- wards the right iliac fossa, and divides into a descending and an ascending branch. The descending branch joins the terminal part of the superior mesenteric, and from the arch thus formed twigs are given to the lower end of the ileum, the vermiform appendix, and the caecum. The ascending branch inosculates with a branch of the right colic, and sends offsets to the ascending colon. The right colic artery (arteria colica dextra) frequently arises in common with the ileo-colic. Escaping from the root of the mesentery it takes a horizontal course to the right, behind the parietal peritoneum on the back wall of the abdomen, and divides into two branches, a superior and an inferior. The superior branch ascends between the two layers of the transverse meso-colon to inosculate with the middle colic; whilst the inferior branch joins the ascending part of the ileo-colic. From the convexity of these arches twigs proceed to the colon. The middle colic artery (arteria colica media) is the highest of the three branches which spring from the concavity of the superior mesenteric. It passes between the two layers of the transverse meso-colon, and divides into a right and a left branch. The right branch joins the superior part of the right colic, whilst the left branch inosculates with the ascending part of the left colic artery^ which is derived from the inferior mesenteric. The Superior Mesenteric Vein lies to the right of the artery and receives tributaries, which come from those

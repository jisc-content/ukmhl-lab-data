THE UPPER LIMB. 96 the forearm to their terminations. While still upon the dorsum of the hand each communicates with the deep veins in the palm of the hand. Cutaneous Nerves. â€” Several cutaneous nerves have already been traced to the integument of the forearm, viz., the anterior and posterior branches of the internal cutaneous nerve to the inner aspect, and the cutaneous part of the musculo-cutaneous and lower external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral upon the outer aspect of the limb. Some additional twigs make their appearance by piercing the fascia in the lower third of the forearm (Figs. 17 and 18). 1. The palmar cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve, .... 2. The palmar cutaneous branch of the V on the front aspect, median nerve, .... ^ 3. The palmar cutaneous branch of the radial nerve, 1. The dorsal branch of the ulnar ^ nerve, Ion the dorsal aspect. 2. The radial nerve, . . . .J The Palmar Cutaneous Branches are small twigs which supply the skin of the palm. The tivig from the ulnar nerve takes origin about the middle of the forearm, but it does not at once pierce the deep fascia. It proceeds down, wards on the ulnar artery, and becomes superficial imme- diately above the annular ligament, and close to the outer side of the insertion of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon into the pisiform bone. It is here, therefore, that it must be sought for. The pabnar cutaneous bra?ich of the median jierve appears through the deep fascia in the interval between the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and the palmaris longus muscles, immediately above the wrist. It is continued downwards into the palm. The palmar branch of the radial nerve runs close to the outer border of the lower part of the forearm. It dees not

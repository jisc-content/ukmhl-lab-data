ABDOMINAL CAVITY. 541 The renal artery gives a small branch—the inferior cap- sular—to the suprarenal body, and also numerous fine twigs to the connective tissue around the kidney. The renal veins join the inferior vena cava. The vein of the left side crosses in front of the aorta, and is the longer of the two. Both receive tributaries from the suprarenal bodies, and the left vein is also joined by the left spermatic or ovarian vein. The Spermatic Arteries (arterise spermaticae interna) are two long slender vessels which spring from the front of the abdominal aorta, a short way below the renal arteries. Diverging from each other, each artery passes obliquely downwards and outwards behind the peritoneum, to the internal abdominal ring, where it joins the other factors of the spermatic cord. As it descends, it rests upon the psoas, and crosses the ureter and the external iliac artery. On the right side, the spermatic artery passes in front of the vena cava inferior. In the female, the corresponding arteries go to the ovaries, and are consequently termed the ovariaii arteries. Within the abdomen proper they have the same relations as the spermatic arteries. In the dissection of the female pelvis they will be followed to their destination. The right spermatic vein joins the vena cava directly, whilst the left vei?i terminates in the left renal vein. The ovarian veins end in the same manner. The Lumbar Arteries (arteri^ lumbales)—five in number on each side—spring from the posterior aspect of the abdo- minal aorta, in series with the intercostal arteries. At pre- sent they are only seen in a very short part of their course. They proceed outwards upon the bodies of the last dorsal and upper four lumbar vertebrae, behind the gangliated cord of the sympathetic, and then disappear under the cover of the psoas muscle. The three upper arteries also pass behind the crura of the diaphragm, and on the right side they are crossed by the inferior vena cava.

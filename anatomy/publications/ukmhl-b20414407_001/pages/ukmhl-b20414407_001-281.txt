INNER SIDE OF THE THIGH. 253 inclines backwards and outwards, and it is inserted behind the pectineus into the whole length of the line which extends from the small trochanter to the linea aspera. Dissection.—Reflect the adductor brevis by cutting it close to its origin, and throwing it downwards and outwards. The posterior division of the obturator nerve is now exposed, and should be traced upwards to the thyroid foramen, and downwards to its distribution upon the adductor magnus. Obturator Nerve.—^The obturator nerve is a branch of the lumbar plexus, and escapes from the pelvis by passing with its companion vessels through the upper part of the thyroid foramen of the innominate bone. While still within the foramen it divides into an anterior and a posterior division. The anterior division of the obturator nerve enters the thigh over the upper border of the obturator externus muscle, and proceeds downwards upon the anterior surface of the adductor brevis. In front of it are the pectineus and adductor longus muscles. It gives branches to three muscles, viz., the adductor longus, the adductor brevis, and the gracilis. Very rarely it will be observed to supply a twig to the pectineus. In addition to these it supphes an articular branch to the hip-joint (Fig. 48, x ); a fine twig which appears at the lower border of the adductor longus to join the sartorial plexus (Fig. 48, i); and a terminal twig which goes to the femoral artery—(Fig. 48, 2) —and breaks up into fine filaments upon its walls. The posterior division of the obturator nerve as it enters the thigh pierces the upper border of the obturator ex- ternus. It extends downwards between the adductor brevis and the adductor magnus, and is chiefly expended in the supply of the latter muscle. It gives also, however, a branch to the obturator externus and an articular branch to the knee-joint (Fig. 48, 3). The latter branch pierces the lower part of the adductor magnus close,to the linea

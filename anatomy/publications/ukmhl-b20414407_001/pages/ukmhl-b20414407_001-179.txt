153 ARTICULATIONS. strength and attachments four portions are recognised. These areâ€” 1. The external lateral ligament. 2. The internal lateral ligament. 3. The anterior ligament. 4. The posterior ligament. The External Lateral Ligament is a strong but short Hgamentous band which is attached above to the lower aspect of the external condyle of the humerus. Below, it is fixed to the orbicular ligament of the radius, and also to the outer side of the olecranon process of the ulna behind this. The orbicular ligament, as we shall afterwards see, is a strong ligamentous collar which surrounds the head of the radius, and retains it in the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna. The Internal Lateral Ligament is fan-shaped. By its upper pointed part it is attached to the internal condyle of the humerus. Inferiorly it spreads out to find insertion into the coronoid and olecranon processes of the ulna. When carefully dissected it will be noticed to consist of three portions, viz., an anterior, a posterior, and a transverse. The a?iterior part springs from the lower and front part of the humeral condyle, and is attached to the inner margin of the coronoid process of the ulna. The posterior part is attached above to the lower and back part of the humeral condyle, whilst below it is fixed to the inner border of the olecranon process. The transverse part consists of a narrow band of fibres, which bridges across the notch between the olecranon and the coronoid processes, and is attached to both. The Anterior Ligament is broad, and composed of fibres which take an irregular course over the anterior aspect of the joint. It is attached to the front of the humerus above the coronoid fossa, whilst below it is inserted into the margin of the coronoid process of the ulna, and also into the orbicular ligament of the radius.

509 ABDOMINAL CAVITY. the two layers of the gastro-hepatic omentum to reinforce the hepatic plexus. The right vagus Hes upon the posterior aspect of the gullet, and at once breaks up into numerous branches which ramify upon the posterior wall of the stomach; it also sends twigs to the cceliacplexus and to the splenic plexus. The Solar or Epigastric Plexus.—In connection with the sympathetic system three large plexuses are formed in front of the vertebral column—viz., the cardiac plexus in the thorax, the solar plexus in the upper part of the abdomen proper, and the hypogastric plexus in the lower part of the abdomen proper. These receive the name of the pre- vertebral plexuses. The solar plexus is by far the largest of the three. It is situated behind the stomach, in front of the aorta and the pillars of the diaphragm. Upon each side it extends as far as the suprarenal capsule, whilst inferiorly it passes down- wards behind the pancreas. On each side of the body, where it lies upon the crus of the diaphragm, a large ganglionic mass, called the se??iilunar ga?iglion, is developed in its midst. Distinctive terms are applied to different parts of the plexus. The portion which connects the semilunar ganglia and surrounds the cceliac axis is called the coeliac plexus. To the outer side of each ganglion the plexus ends in numerous branches for the suprarenal body and kidney, and these are classified under the terms of suprare^ial and renal plexuses. Inferiorly, the plexus has already been seen to send downwards large offshoots which accompany the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery; these are the aortic and superior mesenteric plexuses. Lastly, a small offset from the upper part of each semilunar ganglion is termed the diaphragmatic plexus. Semilunar GangUa.—These are so large that they are usually mistaken by students for lymphatic glands. The ganglion of the right side is placed under cover of the vena

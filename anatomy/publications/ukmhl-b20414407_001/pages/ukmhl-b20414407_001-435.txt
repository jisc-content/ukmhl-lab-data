405 ABDOMINAL WALL. It is important to mark exactly the relation which the lower part of the muscle bears to the spermatic cord. At first the cord lies under cover of the fleshy fibres, but it soon emerges, clothed by the cremaster muscle, and as it is con- tinued downwards and inwards to the external abdominal ring, it lies in front of the conjoined tendon. Especially note the position of the conjoined tendon in relation to the external abdominal ring. It lies immediately behind it, and gives strength to this otherwise weak point in the abdominal parietes. Cremaster Muscle.—This muscle supports the testicle and spermatic cord, and is consequently peculiar to the transversalis. irt's ligament. Fig. 80.—Diagram to illustrate the relation of the lower border of the internal oblique muscle to the cord, the conjoined tendon, and the inguinal canal. O.I. Internal oblique muscle. C.T. Conjoined tendon. The position of the external abdominal ring is indicated by a dotted outline. male. It arises from the inner part of Poupart's ligament, and also derives fibres from the lower border of the internal oblique (rarely from the lower border of the transversalis muscle). Thefleshy fibres descend upon the outer and anterior aspects of the cord in the form of loops, the concavities of which are directed upwards. The depth to which these

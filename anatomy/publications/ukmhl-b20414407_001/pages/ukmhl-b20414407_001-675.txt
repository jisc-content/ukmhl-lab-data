The Fallopian Tubes or Oviducts.—These are two tubes which have as their function the conveyance of the ova or eggs from the ovary to the uterus. Each duct is about three or four inches long, and is contained within the superior free border of the broad ligament of the uterus. Its inner extremity pierces the uterus at its superior angle, whilst its outer end is situated about an inch beyond the ovary and opens into the peritoneal cavity by a constricted parovarium. Fig. 152.—The ampulla and fimbriated end of the Fallopian tube ; the ovary ; and the parovarium. (From Gegenbaur, modified.) orifice {osthiin abdomitiale), surrounded by numbers of fringe-like processes, called fimbricB. By one of these fimbriae, termed the ovariati fimbria, it is attached to the tubal pole of the ovary. The calibre of the Fallopian tube is by no means uniform. As it is traced outwards from the uterus it is at first extremely narrow. This portion is called the isthmus. In the neighbourhood of the ovary it dilates considerably, and receives the name of the ampulla. The ovarian fimbria is longer than the others; it is attached

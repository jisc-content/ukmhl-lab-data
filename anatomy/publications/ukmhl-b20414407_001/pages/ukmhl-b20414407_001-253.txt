FRONT OF THE THIGH. 225 they proceed downwards behind Poupart's Hgament, they carry with them a funnel-shaped prolongation of the lining. This, then, is the femoral sheath, and the dissector will now readily understand that the front wall of the sheath is formed of fascia transversalis from the anterior wall of the abdomen above Poupart's ligament, while the posterior wall is formed of fascia iliaca, prolonged downwards from the posterior abdominal wall. Posterior Wall of the Femoral Sheath.—There are still Fig. 44.—Parts which pass behind Poupart's ligament. (After Luschka). some additional facts relating to the posterior wall of the femoral sheath which require to be mentioned. It is formed, as stated above, by the fascia iliaca; but as this enters the thigh it becomes continuous with the pubic layer of the fascia lata, and further, it is firmly fixed in position by certain connections which it establishes in the thigh. Thus beyond the femoral sheath it is prolonged in an VOL. I.—15

One very distinct and tolerably constant arch requires It is formed by a branch which crosses the posterior aspect of the humerus im- mediately above the olecranon fossa, and connects the pos- terior branch of the superior profunda with the posterior branch of the anas- tomotica. The Posterior In- terosseous Nerve is one of the two ter- minal branches of the musculo-spiral (p. 87), and it reaches the back of the forearm by traversing the sub- stance of the supi- nator brevis, and at the same time wind- ing round the outer aspect of the shaft of the radius. It emerges from the supinator brevis a short distance above the artery of the same name, and is carried downwards between the superficial and deep muscles on the back of the forearm.

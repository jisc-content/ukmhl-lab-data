FRONT OF THE ARM. 67 The terminal cutaneous branch of the musculo-cutaneous will be found in front of the elbow-joint. It pierces the deep fascia on the outer side of the tendon of the biceps. It is a large nerve, and proceeds downwards behind the median cephalic vein. The skin both upon the anterior and posterior aspects of the outer side of the forearm is supplied by this nerve, and it is distributed by two main branches. The anterior and larger bra?ich can be traced as far as the skin over the ball of the thumb. A few of its terminal twigs pierce the fascia above the wrist, and join the radial artery, by which they are conducted to the back of the carpus. The posterior branch may be followed on the dorsal aspect of the limb as far as the wrist. The intercosto-huvieral nerve can usually be traced half way down the upper arm; but the area of skin which it supplies is somewhat variable. The internal cutaneous branch of the fnusculo-spiral proceeds downwards and backwards on a deeper plane, and crosses under the intercosto-humeral. Its filaments extend upon the back of the upper arm as low as the elbow-joint. The small internal cutaneous nerve., or 7ierve of Wrisberg, will be found piercing the deep fascia, to become super- ficial, halfway down the inner side of the upper arm. Its twigs may be followed, in the superficial fascia, as far as the olecranon process. On the inner side of the upper arm, on its dorsal aspect, three nerves therefore have been traced. From within outwards these are: the nerve of Wrisberg, the intercosto- humeral, and the inner cutaneous branch of the musculo- spiral (Fig. 18). The internal cutaneous nerve is chiefly destined for the supply of the skin of the forearm. It appears through the deep fascia half-way down the inner side of the upper arm close to the basilic vein, and a short distance in front of the nerve of Wrisberg. It at once divides into an anterior

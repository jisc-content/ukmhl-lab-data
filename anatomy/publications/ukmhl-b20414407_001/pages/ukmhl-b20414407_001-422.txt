394 ABDOMEN. over the latissimus dorsi. The anterior divisions run for- ward, and a careful dissector may trace them as far as the outer margin of the rectus. The iliac branch of the last dorsal corresponds with the lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves. It differs from the other members of the series in not dividing into an anterior and a posterior branch, and in being destined for the supply of the integument over the gluteal region. It pierces the external oblique muscle in a line with the other lateral nerves, and is then directed downwards over the crest of the ilium. It crosses the iliac crest from one to two inches behind the anterior superior spine. The iliac branch of the ilio-hypogastric nerve is also dis- tributed to the skin of the gluteal region. It pierces the external oblique immediately above the iliac crest, which it usually crosses opposite the tubercle which projects from the outer lip of the crest, about two and a-half inches behind the anterior superior spine of the ilium. Cutaneous Vessels.—Cutaneous arteries are found.accom- panying the cutaneous nerves. Those which are associated with the lateral cutaneous nerves are branches of the aortic intercostal arteries^ whilst those in relation to the anterior cutaneous nerves are derived from the deep and superior epi- gastric arteries., and also from the aortic intercostal arteries. In addition to these, three small branches of the femoral artery ramify in the superficial fascia of the groin. These are— 1. The superficial pudic. 2. The superficial epigastric. 3. The superficial circumflex iliac. They take origin in the thigh, a short distance below Poupart's ligament, and, piercing the fascia lata, diverge from each other in the superficial fascia. The superficial pudic is directed inwards over the sper- matic cord, and gives branches to the skin of the scrotum and under surface of the penis.

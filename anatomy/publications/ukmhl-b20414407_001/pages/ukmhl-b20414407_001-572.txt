536 ABDOMEN. inspection of its abdominal surface. In shape the central tendon resembles a trefoil leaf, of which the right lobe is the largest, and the left lobe the smallest. Upon all sides it is surrounded by muscular fibres. Those which spring from the sternum are much the shortest. Foramina of the Diaphragm.—The continuity of the diaphragm is broken by three large openings, and by some smaller apertures or fissures for the passage of the splanchnic nerves, and the vena azygos minor. The three main open- ings receive the names of the most important objects which they transmit. They are— 1. The aortic. 2. The vena caval. 3. The oesophageal. The aortic openiiig is in the mesial plane in front of the first lumbar vertebra, and between the crura of the dia- phragm. It is bounded in front by the fibrous band which arches across the middle fine and connects the tendinous portions of the two crura. Behind, a fibrous expansion is prolonged inwards on each side, so as to hmit the aperture posteriorly, and in this manner an almost complete fibrous ring may be formed around the aorta. The structures which pass through the aortic opening are—(i) the aorta, (2) the thoracic duct, and (3) the vena azygos major—in this order from left to right. The vena caval ope?iing is at a higher level, being situated opposite the disc between the eighth and the ninth dorsal vertebrae, in front and slightly to the right of the aortic opening. Note that it is placed in the back part of the central tendon at the junction between its middle and right lobes. Its form is somewhat quadrangular, and its margins are prolonged upon the walls of the vena cava as it passes through it. The contraction of the muscular fibres of the diaphragm will therefore tend to increase the size of this opening and the calibre of the vein which it holds. In addition to the vena cava, one or two minute twigs

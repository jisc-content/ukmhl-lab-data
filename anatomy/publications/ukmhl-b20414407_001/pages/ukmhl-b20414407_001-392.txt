364 ABDOMEN. be regarded as lying in the same morphological plane as the bony and ligamentous wall of the pelvis, and as com- pleting the pelvic wall in front in the same manner as the thyroid membrane fills up the gap formed by the thyroid foramen. Upon each side the triangular ligament is attached to the margins of the rami of the pubis and ischium. Its base is somewhat indefinite, and has already been seen to blend along the lower borders of the transversus perinei muscles with the fascia of Colles. In addition to this attachment, however, a careful dissection in a good subject will show Fig. 69.â€”Diagram of the triangular ligament. T. Triangular ligament. that the central part of the base projects backwards and downwards in the form of a short process or peak, which joins the central point of the perineum. Near the sym- physis pubis some transverse fibres, in association with the triangular ligament, pass from one side of the pubic arch to the other, and form a more or less distinct band, called the transverse perineal ligament. Between the upper border of this band and the sub-pubic ligament an oval gap is left for the passage of the dorsal vein of the penis. In the erect posture of the body the superficial surface

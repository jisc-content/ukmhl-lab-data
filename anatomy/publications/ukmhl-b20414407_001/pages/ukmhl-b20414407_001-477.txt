447 ABDOMINAL CAVITY. drawn horizontally around the trunk so as to pass through the highest point on the iliac crest on each side that is seen from the front. This point is always easily determined, as a prominent tubercle juts out from the outer lip of the iHac crest at that spot. It is situated rather more than two inches behind the anterior superior iliac spine, and it marks the point where the outline of the body meets the iHac crest. The line which encircles the body at this level indicates on the surface the position of the intertubercular plane of sub- division. The two horizontal planes, thus placed, map out the abdomen into three districts or zones, which are termed from above downwards—(i.) the costal., (2.) the umbilical, and (3.) the hypogastric zone. The two vertical planes of subdivision are called the right and left inid-Poiipart planes., seeing that they corre- spond on the surface to two perpendicular lines reared from the mid-points of Poupart's ligaments. By these mid-Poupart planes, each of the three zones determined by the horizontal planes of section is subdivided into three. The costal zone is mapped off into a central epigastric regio7i and a right and left hypochoiidriac region; the umbilical zone into a central nnihilicalregion and a right and left lumbar region ; and the hypogastric zone into a central hypogastric region and a right and left iliac region.

5 DISSECTION OF THE BACK. teres minor. of the spinal nerves. As the latter pass backwards, they divide into external and internal branches. Both of these supply twigs to the muscles amongst which they lie; but one or other also con- tains some sensory fibres which come to the surface to supply the skin. In the dorsal region the upper six or seven cuta- neous nerves are the ter- minations of the internal branches of the posterior primary divisions of the spinal nerves. They be- come superficial close to the vertebral spines, and are to be sought for near the mesial plane. It is not uncommon to find one or more of them piercing the trapezius one or two inches external to the line of emergence of the others. The branch which comes from the second dorsal nerve is the largest of the series; and it may be traced outwards beyond the spine of the scapula. The lower five or six cuta- neous nerves in the dorsal regio?i are the terminal twigs of the external branches of the posterior primary divisions of the spinal nerves ; and, consequently, they must be looked for at a short distance Petiti Fig. 2.â€”Cutaneous nerves and superficial muscles of the back.

ABDOMEN. 640 along its whole length to the broad ligament, and shows on its surface a gutter-like groove leading from the constricted mouth of the tube to the ovary (Fig. 152). In the typical position of parts the Fallopian tube pro- ceeds horizontally outwards on the pelvic floor. It then turns vertically upwards along the hilum or attached border of the ovary, and gaining the tubal pole, it bends upon itself and turns downwards upon the posterior free border and the inner surface of the ovary, both of which it in great part covers (Waldeyer). It may, therefore, be considered to consist of three parts :—(i.) the first in relation to the floor of the pelvis; (2.) the secojtd in relation to the anterior border of the ovary; (3.) the third in relation to the posterior border and inner surface of the ovary. Round Ligaments of the Uterus.—The round ligaments are two cord-like bands largely composed of involuntary muscular fibres, which are attached to the body of the uterus immediately in front of and a little below the entrance of the Fallopian tube—one on each side. From this, each ligament is directed outwards and forwards between the layers of the broad ligament and in front of the oviduct, to the internal abdominal ring. It has already' been examined within the inguinal canal. In the young subject the peritoneum is usually prolonged along with it into this canal in the form of a tubular process termed the " Ca?ial of Nucky Later on this becomes obliterated. Pelvic Blood Vessels. The manner in which the blood vessels of the pelvis should be dissected is described at p. 587. In the female three additional arteries will be found, viz.— 1. The uterine, ^ 2. The vaginal, / 3. The ovarian, from the abdominal aorta. branches of the internal iliac.

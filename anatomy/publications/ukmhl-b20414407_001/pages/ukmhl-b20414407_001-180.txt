154 THE UPPER LIMB. The Posterior Ligament is weaker than the anterior. It has a loose attachment to the back of the humerus, above the olecranon fossa, and inferiorly it is fixed to the olecranon and the orbicular ligament of the radius. Synovial Membrane.—The joint should be opened by making a transverse incision through the anterior ligament. The synovial membrane will be seen lining the deep surface of the hgamentous capsule, and to be reflected from this humerus. biceps — brachial is anticus median-basilic vein brachial artery supinator brevis pronator radii teres ext. com. dig. radius. supinator brevis. Fig. 35.—Vertical antero-posterior section through the humerus and radius at the elbow-joint. upon the non-articular parts of the bones which are enclosed within the ligaments. In front of the humerus it lines the radial and coronoid fossae, and behind it is prolonged up- wards in the form of a loose diverticulum into the olecranon fossa. In these fossae a quantity of soft oily fat is developed in connection with the synovial membrane, and occupies the recesses when the bony processes are withdrawn from them.

vi PREFACE. further, that even in the same individual striking changes are produced during Hfe, both in the position and in the form of the organs, by different conditions of the hollow viscera. Such being the case, the author is well aware that in the present state of our knowledge it is impossible in every case to state dogmatically the average condition of the various organs and viscera; still, in the short descrip- tion which he has given, he has striven to approach as nearly as possible to the truth, by the careful study of specially prepared specimens and models. It is very evident, therefore, that the topographical anatomy of the abdominal cavity offers at the present moment a most promising field for research, and the author has little doubt that in a short time more definite and exact knowledge will be obtained upon the effect which different degrees of enlargement or distension of particular organs may exercise upon neighbouring viscera. It is right that the student should not lose sight of the fact that in the course of an ordinary dissection the parts which are displayed are artificially separated from each other, and in consequence their true relations are disturbed. It is necessary to correct, therefore, impressions gained by dissection by the study of sections of the frozen body. The one form of study is the complement of the other; both are required for the acquisition of a proper knowledge of topographical anatomy. Sectional anatomy is the true' anatomy, but it can only be appreciated and understood by the key which is supplied by dissection.

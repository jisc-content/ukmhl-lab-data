ABDOMINAL CAVITY. 539 the right side the inferior vena cava hes close to the aorta as high as the second lumbar vertebra, but above this it is separated from it by the fleshy part of the right crus. In the interval between the right crus of the diaphragm and the vessel, the student has already noted the receptaculum chyli and the vena azygos major. On the left side, the left gangliated cord of the sympathetic is in relation to the artery below the level of the left crus. Branches of the Abdominal Aorta.—The branches of the abdominal aorta may be described under two heads, viz.— (i.) Those which come off in pairs. (2.) Those which arise singly. Paired Branches. 1. Inferior phrenic arteries. 2. Middle capsular arteries. 3. Renal arteries. 4. Spermatic or ovarian arteries. 5. Lumbar arteries. Single Branches. 1. The coeliac axis. 2. The superior mesenteric. 3. The inferior mesenteric. 4. The middle sacral. The single branches have already been described, with the exception of the middle sacral, which arises from the extremity of the aorta between the two common iliacs. It will be studied in connection with the pelvis. The paired branches may now be examined. The Inferior Phrenic Arteries (arterise phrenicae inferiores) have already been noticed upon the under surface of the diaphragm. They are two in number, and are the first branches which spring from the abdominal aorta. Diverging from each other, the artery of the right side passes behind the inferior vena cava, whilst the artery of the left side goes behind the oesophagus. Near the posterior border of the central tendon of the diaphragm each divides into an external and an internal branch. The external branch proceeds out- wards to anastomose with the intercostal arteries, whilst the internal brajtch curves forwards in front of the central tendon, and ends by anastomosing with its fellow, and with the

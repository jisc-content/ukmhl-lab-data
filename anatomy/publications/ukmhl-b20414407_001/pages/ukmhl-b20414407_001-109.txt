83 FRONT OF THE ARM. below constitutes the apex. The boundaries should now be thoroughly cleaned, and then the contents of the space may be dissected. Within the space, as we have already stated, there is the termination of the brachial artery, and the radial and ulnar branches into which it divides. To the outer side of the main vessel is placed the tendon of the biceps, and to its inner side the median nerve. A quantity of loose fat is also present. The ulnar artery leaves the space, by passing under cover of the pronator radii teres; the radial artery is continued downwards beyond the apex of the space, overlapped by the supinator longus. The median nerve disappears between the two heads of the pronator radii teres, and the tendon of the biceps inclines backwards between the two bones of the forearm, to reach its insertion into the radial tuberosity. When the fatty tissue has been thoroughly removed the floor of the space will be revealed. This is formed by the brachialis anticus and the supinator brevis muscles. In this situation the brachialis anticus is closely applied to the anterior aspect of the elbow-joint, whilst the supinator brevis is wrapped round the upper part of the radius. Now divide the bicipital fascia, and separate the bound- ing muscles widely from each other. Other structures come into view, but they cannot, strictly speaking, be regarded as lying within the space proper. They areâ€” (i) the musculo-spiral nerve, the anterior branch of the superior profunda artery, and the radial recurrent branch of the radial artery, lying deeply in the internal between the supinator longus and the brachialis anticus; (2) the anterior branch of the anastomotica magna, and the anterior ulnar recurrent branch of the ulnar artery, placed under cover of the pronator radii teres.

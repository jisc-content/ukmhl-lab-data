107 FOREARM AND HAND. thirds of the forearm it closely accompanies the artery, and lies on its inner side. In the anticubital fossa the ulnar artery rests upon the brachialis anticus; beyond this it is in contact behind with the flexor profundus digitorum; whilst at the wrist the artery lies upon the anterior surface of the anterior annular ligament. Branches of the Ulnar Artery.—In the forearm the ulnar artery gives off the following branches :—- 1. Anterior ulnar recurrent. 4. Anterior ulnar carpal. 2. Posterior ulnar recurrent. 5. Posterior ulnar carpal. 3. Common interosseous. 6. Muscular twigs. The muscular twigs are of small size, and come off at variable points for the supply of the neighbouring muscles. The anterior ulnar recurrent artery is the smaller of the two recurrent branches. It runs upwards in front of the internal condyle of the humerus, in the interval between the pronator radii teres and the brachialis anticus muscles, and it anastomoses with the anterior terminal branch of the anastomotica magna. The posterior ubiar recurre?it passes inwards under cover of the flexor sublimis digitorum, and then turns upwards between the two heads of origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris to gain the interval between the internal condyle of the humerus and the olecranon process on the posterior aspect of the limb. Here it comes into contact with the ulnar nerve, and anastomoses with the posterior terminal branch of the anastomotica magna and with the inferior profunda artery. It is not uncommon to find the two recurrent arteries arising from the ulnar trunk by a short common stem. The common interosseous artery is a short, wide trunk, which takes origin immediately below the recurrent branches, about an inch or so below the commencement of the ulnar artery. It proceeds backw^ards, and at the upper margin of

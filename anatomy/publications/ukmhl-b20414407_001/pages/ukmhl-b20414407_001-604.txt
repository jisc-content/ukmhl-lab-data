ABDOMEN, arch, and in this situation it is generally known as the su/Cf'ior or dc'ep layer o f the triangular liganicnt. This con- sists of two lateral halves, each of which on reaching the urethra sweeps backwards around the anterior border of the levator ani, and joins the visceral layer (^Fig. 12S). Interiorly, it is attached to the base of the triangular liga- ment, which, as we have seen, is on the same morphological pilane as the bone ; consequently this attachment is quite in keeping with tlie attachment of the fascia further back, bladder parietal pelvic fascia obturator internus .- prost.-..- sinus poculav.- - le\-ator ain ramus of pubis compressor urethr.e -■ triangular ligament - crus penis — erector p>enis - superficial permeal \-essels and ner\-es the fascia of CoUes . .v.^sule of prostate. .. -.-.1 fascia. ietal pelvic fascia, ihyroid membrane.

Visceral Layer of Pelvic Fascia.—In the greater part of its extent the visceral pelvic fascia springs from the inner surface of the parietal pelvic fascia, along the white line. In front, however, it has an attachment to the back of the body of the pubic bone abo-ve the attachment of the parietal layer. It is from the portion of bone between these layers

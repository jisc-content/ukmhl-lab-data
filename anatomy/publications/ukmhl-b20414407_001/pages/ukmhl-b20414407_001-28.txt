2 THE UPPER LIMB. slight degree, to one side or the other. The spines of the vertebras are the only parts of the vertebral column which come to the surface; they alone yield direct information, by touch, to the surgeon as to the condition of the spine. At the lower end of the neck, the spine of the seventh cervical vertebra {vertebraprominens) makes a visible projection ; and the spines of the first two dorsal vertebrae are likewise very prominent. As a rule, the most evident of the three is that of the first dorsal vertebra. At a lower level, in subjects of good muscular development, a mesial furrow is produced by the prominence of the erector spinae muscle on each side, and the spines of the vertebrae may be felt at the bottom of this groove. It attains its greatest depth in the upper part of the lumbar region, and it fades away below at the level of the spine of the third sacral vertebra. The finger should next be passed along the crest of the ilium as it pursues its sigmoid course forwards and outwards. Note that the posterior superior spine of the ilium lies in a slight depression on a level with the second sacral spine. The scapula is for the most part thickly covered by muscles; but, in spite of this, in the majority of cases its general outline can be made out. The scapula covers a consider- able area on the upper portion of the chest on its posterior aspect. With the hand by the side its superior angle corresponds with the second intercostal space, whilst its inferior angle reaches down as far as the seventh, or even the eighth, rib. It is very mobileâ€”moving more or less with every movement of the limb. The spine and acromion process of the scapula will be seen to be subcutaneous throughout. It is important to make out accurately the angle which is formed by the meeting of the lower border of the spine with the outer margin of the acromion. This very apparent bony point is selected by the surgeon as the upper limit in making measurements of the limb.

THE LOWER LIMB. 272 digitorum descends in front of the ankle-joint, and, passing through the anterior annular ligament, divides into four pieces, which diverge from each other on the dorsum of the foot to reach the four outer toes. On the dorsum of the first phalanx each of the inner three slips is joined on the outer side by a tendon from the extensor brevis digitorum. The manner in which the four tendons of the extensor Fig. 51.â€”Transverse section through the calf of the leg. longus digitorum are inserted on the dorsal surfaces of the four outer toes is so similar to that in which the corre- sponding tendons of the fingers are attached, that a very brief description will suffice. An expansion is formed on the dorsal surface of the first phalanx; this is joined by the slender tendons of the lumbrical and interosseous muscles, and divides into a central and two lateral slips.

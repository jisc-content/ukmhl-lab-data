ABDOMEN. 420 wards for a short distance between Poupart's ligament and the internal abdominal ring, and then changing its direction it is carried upwards and inwards on the inner side of the ring. Reaching the deep surface of the rectus it enters the rectal sheath, and proceeding vertically upwards, ends near the lower margin of the thorax in branches which sink into the substance of the muscle and anastomose with the superior epigastric and intercostal arteries. In the first part of its course, the deep epigastric lies in the extra-peritoneal fat between the peritoneum and the fascia transversalis. It soon, however, pierces the fascia, and, passing in front of the fold of Douglas, ascends be- tween the rectus muscle and the posterior lamella of its sheath. These are its immediate relations, but there are others of equal importance, viz. (i) as it runs upwards it lies close to the inner side of the internal abdominal ring; (2) as the spermatic cord traverses the inguinal canal it lies in front of the artery, only separated from it by transversalis fascia; (3) as the vas deferens passes from the inguinal canal into the abdominal cavity it hooks round the outer side of the artery. The braiuhes which spring from the deep epigastric areâ€” 1. Cremasteric. 2. Pubic. 3. Cutaneous. 4. Muscular. The cremasteric is a small twig which supplies the cremaster muscle and anastomoses with the spermatic artery. The pubic, also insignificant in size, goes to the back of the pubis, where it anastomoses with a small branch from the obturator. The importance of this branch arises from the fact that the anastomosis which it establishes sometimes becomes so large as to take the place of the obturator artery. The muscular branches are given to the substance of the rectus, and the cutaneous offsets pierce the abdominal muscles and anasto- mose with the superficial epigastric artery.

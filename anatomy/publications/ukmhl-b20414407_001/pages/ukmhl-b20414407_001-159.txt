133 The deep branch of the ulnar may, therefore, be said to supply all the muscles of the palm which lie to the inner side of the tendon of the flexor longus poUicis, whilst the median supplies the three muscles which He to the outer side of that tendon. There are two exceptions to this generalisation, viz., the two outer lumbrical muscles, which lie upon the inner side of the tendon, and are yet supphed by the median ner%"e. Deep Palmar AtcIl—The artery which takes the chief part in the formation of this arch is the radial. This vessel enters the palm, by coming forwards through the upper part of the first interosseous space betweeen the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. In the present state of the dissection it makes its appearance between the contiguous margins of the adductor obliquus and adductor tmnsversus pollicis. It runs inwards upon the interossei muscles and the metacarpal bones immediately below their bases. As it approaches the fifth metacarpal bone it is joined by the deep branch of the ulnar artery, and in this manner the deep palmar arch is completed. The deep palmar arch does not show so strong a curve as the superficial arch, and it is placed at a higher level in the palm. It is closely accompanied by the deep branch of the ulnar ner%-e: and is separated from the superficial palmar arch by the group of flexor tendons, the lumbrical muscles, the branches of the median nerve which occupy the middle compartment of the palm, and also at its inner part by the fle:!cor brevis minimi digiti, under which the deep branch of the ulnar artery passes to join the radial. The dram/itrs which spring from the deep palmar arch are: (i) the recurren/—a few small twigs which ran up- ^va^ds in front of the carpus to anastomose with branches of the anterior carpal arch : {2) sufirnW /-crfcrjfin^, which pass back%vards in the upper parts of the interosseous spaces to anastomose \vith the dorsal interosseous arteries: and (^3 ) the pumar in/erosseous—three in number—which pass

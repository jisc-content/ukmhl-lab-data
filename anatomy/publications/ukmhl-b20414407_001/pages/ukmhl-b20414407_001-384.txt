ABDOMEN. 356 skin between the anus and coccyx, and to the external sphincter muscle. Ano-coccygeal Body.—An indefinite mass of muscular and fibrous tissue which lies between the tip of the coccyx and the anus receives the name of ano-coccygeal body. It is best seen in sections through the pelvis, and it requires notice on account of the support which it gives to the rectum in front of the coccyx. The muscular tissue which enters into its constitution belongs to the levator ani and the external and internal sphincter muscles (Symington). The superficial fascia in this locality has already been studied. The following is a list of the structures which still require to be examined :— 1. The superficial perineal vessels and nerves. 2. The long pudendal nerve. 3. The root of the penis \- The bulb and the crura. 5. The triangular ligament. 6. The pudic vessels and nerve and their branches. 7. The compressor urethrce muscle. 8. Cowper's glands. 9. The membranous portion of the urethra. 10. The posterior layer of the triangular ligament [i.e.^ the parietal pelvic fascia opposite the pubic arch). Superficial Perineal Vessels and Nerves.—The superficial perineal vessels and nerves must now be followed out. There are two arteries and three nerves to be looked for:— Urethral Triangle. 4. Arteries. Nerves. f CI. Superficial perineal artery. [2. Transverse perineal artery. 1. Posterior or external superficial perineal nerve. 2. Anterior or internal superficial perineal nerve. 3. The long pudendal nerve or the nerve of Soemmer- ring.

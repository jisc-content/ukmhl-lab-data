376 ABDOMEN. solid secretion, derived from numerous sebaceous glands which open upon it. During parturition, the labia majora are unfolded, and thus give the vagina a greater capability of dilatation. The labia majora enclose an elliptical fissure, which is termed the pudendal clefts or the tiro-genitalfissure, on account of its containing the apertures of the urethra and vagina. Within this fissure a slightly marked crescentic fold of integument stretching between the hinder parts of the labia majora will be observed. This fold receives the name of the fourchette^'' or frcenuluni pudendi^ It is usually ruptured in first labours. Between the fourchette and the entrance to the vagina there is a depression which is known as the fossa navicularis. It may be well for the student to bear in mind that the term " perineum " in the language of the accoucheur is used in a very restricted sense. It is given to the narrow interval which exists between the anus and the fourchette. The Labia Minora or Nymphse represent the male prepuce. They are two pendulous folds of integument which lie within the labia majora. To display them fully the labia majora must be pulled apart. They are placed one on each side of the vaginal orifice. As they proceed forwards they become more prominent, and at the same time converge so as to approximate to each other more closely. Reaching the clitoris, each terminates by splitting into two divisions or folds. The smaller and lower fold is attached to the under surface of the clitoris, and receives the name of frcBnuluni clitoridis. The upper fold arches over the cHtoris like a hood, and unites with the correspond- ing fold of the opposite side to form the prceputiu7n clitoridis. The Clitoris is the homologue of the penis, and, not- withstanding its diminutive proportions, it presents a close resemblance to the male organ both in appearance and structure. It is a minute elongated projection placed below

It is simply a reduplica- tion of this layer. It is interesting to note that the stomach is not completely covered by peritoneum. There is a small triangular area situated on its posterior surface immediately below the oesophagus, which is bare, and rests directly upon the left crus of the diaphragm. The lieno-renal iiganient, formed of two layers of peri- toneum, passes from the inner face of the spleen to the front surface of the left kidney. It is a short fold, and between its two layers the branches of the splenic artery reach the hilum of the spleen (Figs. 99 and 117, B). The phrefiico-colic liganmit has been already noticed (P- 463)- The ligaments of the liver are five in number—mz. (i.) the ligamentum teres; (2.) the falciform ligament; (3.) the coronary ligament; (4.) the right lateral; and (5.) the left lateral ligaments. The ligamentum teres is not a peritoneal ligament, but it is convenient to describe it with them. It is a fibrous cord, in fact the obliterated umbilical vein, which extends from the umbilicus upwards, backwards and to the right, to the anterior part of the longitudinal fissure on the under surface of the liver. The falciform ligament, also called the broad or the suspensory ligament, is a double layer of peritoneum of a triangular shape. By its anterior border \t is attached to the anterior wall of the abdomen, and to the under surface of the diaphragm, whilst by its posterior border it is fixed to the upper and anterior surfaces of the liver, so as to mark it off into a right and left lobe. Its loiver border or base is free, and contains between its two peritoneal layers the liga- mentum teres. Along the line of its attachment to the liver the two layers separate—the one spreading over the left lobe and the other over the right lobe. When followed back-

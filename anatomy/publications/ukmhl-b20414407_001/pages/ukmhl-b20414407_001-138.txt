THE UPPER LIMB. 112 outer part of the flexor profundus digitorum,i and the pronator quadratus, whilst its terminal filament proceeds downwards, behind the last-named muscle, to help in the supply of the carpal joints. Wrist and Palm. In this dissection we meet with the following struc- tures :— 1. Palmaris brevis and the palmar cutaneous nerves. 2. Palmar fascia. 3. Superficial palmar arch and its branches. 4. Median and ulnar nerves and their branches. 5. Anterior annular ligament, the flexor tendons, and the flexor sheaths. 6. Lumbrical muscles. 7. Short muscles of the thumb and little finger. 8. Deep palmar arch and its branches. 9. Arteria princeps pollicis and arteria radialis indicis. Surface Anatomy.—In the centre of the palm the de- pression, known as the "hollow of the hand," may be remarked. Along the ulnar border of the palm this is bounded by a rounded elevation, called the hypothenar eminence^ which is produced by the subjacent short, intrinsic muscles of the little finger. The thenar eminence., or ball of the thumb, formed by the short muscles of that digit, is the marked projection which limits the palmar hollow above and on the outer side; whilst the transverse elevation above the roots of the fingers, which corresponds to the metacarpo- ^ The flexor profundus digitorum is therefore supplied by two nerves, viz., the ulnar and the median. The precise range of supply by each of these nerves is somewhat variable. In four cases Dr. Brooks found the division of the muscle which belongs to the index finger supplied by the median ; the part belonging to the little finger supplied by the ulnar ; whilst the portions belonging to the middle and ring digits received nerve filaments from both nerves.

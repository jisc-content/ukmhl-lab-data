149 FOREARM AND HAND. extensor which goes to that digit, whilst the inner ends in the dorsal expansion. Posterior Interosseous Nerve.—The terminal filament of this nerve can now be traced downwards to the dorsal aspect of the carpus. It passes under cover of the extensor indicis, the tendons of the extensor communis, and the posterior annular ligament. On the carpus it ends in a gangliform swelling, from which proceed fine twigs for the supply of the numerous joints in the vicinity. 9 Fig. 33. (From Luschka.) 1.

Dissection.—The limb should now be turned round, so that the trans- verse metacarpal ligament which stretches across the palmar surface of the heads of the metacarpal bones may be examined previous to the dissection of the interosseous muscles. Tranverse Metacarpal Ligament.—The transverse meta- carpal ligament is a strong band composed of transverse fibres, which is placed upon the palmar aspect of the heads of the four metacarpal bones of the fingers. Commencing on the outer side upon the distal extremity of the index metacarpal, it ends at the inner margin of the hand upon the head of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. It is not directly attached to the bones, but is fixed to the power- ful anterior ligaments of the four inner metacarpo-phalangeal

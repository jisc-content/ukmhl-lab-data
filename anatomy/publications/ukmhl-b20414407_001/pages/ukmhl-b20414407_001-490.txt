460 ABDOMEN. The jejunu7n and ileum constitute the coils of the small intestine, and are more or less completely covered by the great omentum. The jejunum begins where the duodenum ends, viz., on the left side of the body of the second lumbar vertebra; and the ileum ends in the lower part of the right lumbar region by joining the caecum or the commencement of the great intestine. The subdivision of the small intestine is of the most arbitrary kind. After mapping off the duodenum it is customary for anatomists to look upon the upper two-fifths of the remainder as being jejunum, and the lower three-fifths as being ileum. There is no hard-and-fast line of demarcation between the three divi- sionsâ€”the one passes insensibly into the other ; and as the distinction is only to be found by an examination of the interior of the tube, it is impossible for the student at present to see any difference at all between them. To expose the commencement of the jejunum, the great omentum should be thrown upwards with the enclosed transverse colon over the lower margin of the thoracic wall. The coils of the small intestine should then be drawn over to the right. The junction between the duodenum and the jejunum will now be seen on the left side of the vertebral column, at the level of the second lumbar vertebra. The termination of the duodenum is fixed, and the jejunum bends suddenly forwards and downwards upon it, forming the duodeno-jejunal flexure. To bring the termination of the ileum into view, the coils of the intestine should be turned over to the left. The terminal part of the ileum, which has no great latitude of movement, will be seen passing upwards across the ihac vessels and upon the psoas muscle, to join the caecum immediately above the inter- tubercular plane in the lower part of the right lumbar region. The coils formed by the jejunum and ileum are suspended from the posterior wall of the abdomen by a wide fold of peritoneum, called the mesentery. They are thus freely

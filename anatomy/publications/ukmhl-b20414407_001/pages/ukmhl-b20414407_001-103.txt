77 FRONT OF THE ARM. appearing in the interval between the long and inner heads of the triceps. Branches of the Brachial Artery.—A considerable num- ber of branches spring from the brachial artery. Those which arise from its outer aspect are irregular in number, origin, and size. They are termed the external branches, and are distributed to the muscles and integument on the front of the arm. The series of internal branches which proceed from the inner and posterior aspect of the parent trunk are named as follows as we meet them from above downwards :— 1. Superior profunda. I 3. Nutrient. 2. Inferior profunda. | 4. Anastomotica magna. The superior profunda is the largest of the branches which spring from the brachial trunk. It takes origin about an inch or so below the lower margin of the teres major, and associates itself with the musculo-spiral nerve, which it accompanies to the back of the arm. Conse- quently, only a short part of the vessel is seen in the present dissection. It soon disappears from view between the long and inner heads of the triceps. The inferior profunda is a long slender artery, which can be recognized from the fact that it follows closely the course which is pursued by the ulnar nerve. Its origin is somewhat uncertain. As a general rule, it issues from the brachial artery opposite the insertion of the coraco- brachialis, but very frequently it will be seen to arise in common with the superior profunda. It pierces the in- ternal intermuscular septum, with the ulnar nerve, and descends behind this aponeurotic partition to the interval between the olecranon and the internal condyle of the humerus. The nutrie?it artery to the humerus may arise directly from the brachial trunk, or take origin from the inferior profunda. It should be sought for at the lower border

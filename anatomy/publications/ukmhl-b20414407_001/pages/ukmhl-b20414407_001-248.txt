THE LOWER LIMB. 220 is placed between the extensor muscles in the front of the thigh and the hamstring muscles on the posterior aspect of the thigh; the internal interjnuscular septiwi intervenes between the extensor muscles and the adductor muscles on the inner aspect of the limb; whilst the posterior inter- 7miscular septiwi^ very weak and inconspicuous in comparison with the other two, is interposed between the adductor and the hamstring muscles. These partitions will be dis- closed in the subsequent dissection. In the meantime merely observe that the internal and the external septa show on the surface of the fascia in the lower part of the thigh as white lines. The thigh is in this manner divided into three osteo-fascial compartments, viz., a7i anterior con- taining the extensor muscles and the anterior crural nerve; a posterior^ holding the hamstrings and the great sciatic nerve ; and an internal^ for the adductors with the obtu- rator nerve. (Fig. 42.) Patellar Bursa.—This is situated upon the superficial aspect of the patella (Fig. 39). Pinch up the fascia lata as it passes over this bone with the forceps, and make a transverse incision through the w^all of the sac large enough to admit the finger. It will then be seen to extend down- wards for a short distance upon the ligamentum patellae. It is usually intersected by fibrous bands and cords. Deep Dissection. In this dissection, the following parts require to be examined:— 1. The femoral sheath. 2. Crural branch of genito-crural nerve. 3. External cutaneous nerve. 4. Sartorius muscle. 5. Anterior crural nerve and its branches. 6. Femoral vessels and their branches. 7. Ilio-psoas muscle.

413 ABDOMINAL WALL. upon all sides. Here the anterior wall or lamella is formed by the aponeurosis of the external oblique fused with the anterior layer of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique, whilst the posterior wall or lamella is formed by the fusion of the posterior layer of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique with the aponeurosis of the transversalis. Superiorly, the rectus muscle rests directly upon the costal cartilages, and the sheath is merely represented by the aponeurosis of the external oblique, which covers the muscle Fig. 83.â€”The dotted line represents the peritoneum. anteriorly. Inferiorly, the posterior wall of the sheath is also absent, and the rectus rests on the transversalis fascia. Here, however, the anterior wall is formed by a blending of all three aponeuroses. The lower free margin of the posterior lamella of the sheath can be easily defined by raising the rectus and work- ing with the handle of the knife. It usually presents a sharp lunated edge, the concavity of which is directed

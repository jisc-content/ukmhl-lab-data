267 THE LEG. foot, communicates with the external saphenous nerve, and then divides into two branches, which supply the contiguous margins of the third, fourth, and fifth toes. Therefore, with the exception of the adjacent sides of the great toe and the second toe, which are supplied by the anterior tibial nerve, and the outer side of the little toe, which is supplied by the external saphenous nerve, the musculo-cutaneous nerve furnishes twigs to the two margins of each of the toes.^ The anterior tibial ?ierve, or rather its internal termi^ial bra?ich, pierces the deep fascia on the dorsum of the foot in the interval between the first and second metatarsal bones. It receives a communicating branch from the inner part of the musculo-cutaneous, and ends by divid- ing into two twigs, which go to supply the adjacent margins of the great toe and the second toe. Deep Fascia.â€”The fatty superficial fascia should be removed in order that the deep fascia may be displayed. This aponeurosis does not form a complete investment for the leg. It is absent over the internal subcutaneous surface of the tibia, and is attached to the anterior and internal borders of that bone. It is also absent over the triangular subcutaneous surface on the lower part of the fibula, being attached to the ridges which limit this area in front and behind. It is not equally dense throughout. In the upper part of the front of the leg it is thick and strong, but it thins as it is traced downwards, and on the dorsum of the foot it becomes exceedingly fine. Its great strength in the upper part of the front of the leg is due to the fact that here it gives origin to subjacent muscles. In the neighbourhood of the ankle-joint it forms the thickened bands or annular ligaments which retain the tendons in ^ Very frequently the distribution of the musculo-cutaneous nerve is more restricted, and in these cases the external saphenous nerve will, in all probability, be found to supply the outer two and a half toes.

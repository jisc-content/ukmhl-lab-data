617 PEL VIS. Sacro-iliac Articulation.—The sacrum is wedsred in between the two innominate bones, and is held fast in this position by the sinuous form of the opposed articular surfaces and the strong liga- ments which pass between the bones. These ligaments are— 1. The anterior sacro-iliac. 2. The posterior sacro-iliac. 3. The oblique sacro-iliac. 4. Great sacro-sciatic. 5. Small sacro-sciatic. The anterior sacro-iliac liga- ment is by no means strong. It is composed of a series of short fibres stretching across in front of the joint, and connect- ing the bones anteriorly. The posterior sacro-iliac liga- ment is exceedingly strong. It consists of fibrous bands, which connect the rough surface on the posterior part of the lateral aspect of the sacrum with a corresponding rough surface on the ilium, behind the auricular surface. Upon the posterior sacro-iliac ligaments the strength of the articulation chiefly depends. As the sacrum narrows towards its dorsal surface it cannot be regarded in any sense as forming the key- stone of an arch. It may be regarded as being in a great measure suspended from the ihac bones by these ligaments. The oblique ligament is simply a specially thickened part of the posterior sacro-iliac ligament. Above, it is fixed to the posterior superior spine of the ilium ; whilst, inferiorly, it is inserted into the lateral tubercle of the third piece of the sacrum.

3o6 THE LOWER LIMB. under surface of the sustentaculum tali and inclines inwards towards the great toe. The tendon of the flexor longus digitorum., on the other hand, inclines outwards to reach the middle of the foot, where it divides into four tendons for the four outer toes. Moreover, the tendons of these two muscles cross each other in the sole— the tendon of the flexor digit- orum lying upon the plantar sur- face of the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis, and receiving from it a strong tendinous slip. Sir William Turner has called attention to the fact that this slip, which passes from the ten- don of the flexor longus hallucis to the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, varies greatly in magnitude and in the manner in which it is connected with the flexor tendons of the toes. In the majority of cases it goes to the tendons of the second and third toes; in some cases, how- ever, only to the tendon of the second toe, or to the tendons of the second, third, and fourth toes. Very rarely does it divide so as to bring all the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum into connection with the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis.

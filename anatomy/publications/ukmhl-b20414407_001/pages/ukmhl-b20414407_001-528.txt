ABDOMEN. 492 tinguish between characteristic portions of each—i.e.^ be- tween portions taken at some distance from the arbitrary line of division. The following are the essential points of difference which would guide him in deciding which was ileum and which jejunum :— Jejunum. Ileum. Valvtda Coiiniventes. Few in number and poorly de- veloped, or, in its lower part, absent altogether. Numerous and well marked. Villi. Numerous and large. | Not so numerous and not so I large. Peyer's Patches. Few in number, small in size, and, as a rule, nearly circular in outline. ]\Iore numerous, of large size, and oblonc: in form. Dissection.—Ligature the great intestine about four inches above the entrance of the ileum, and divide the gut above this point. The nozzle of the bellows should now be introduced into the attached portion of ileum, and the caecum inflated until its walls are tense. This portion of the intestine should then be hung up to dry. Next slit open the colon in the same manner as the small intestine, and examine its inner surface. Great Intestine.—Transverse and oblique ridges or folds, corresponding to the constrictions which separate the sacculi are everywhere apparent on the inner surface of the large intestine. If the longitudinal bands of muscular fibres be removed or divided at short intervals, and the gut stretched, both sacculi and constrictions disappear, and the wall of the bowel becomes uniform. The mucous membrane of the great intestine is absolutely destitute of villi, but solitary glands are present in considerable numbers. If the mucous surface be examined with a lens, its surface will be seen to be studded over with the round mouths of tubular glands, which are embedded in the mucous membrane {crypts of

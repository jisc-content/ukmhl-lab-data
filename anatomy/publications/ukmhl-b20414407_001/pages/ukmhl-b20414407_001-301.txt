THE LEG. The central slip is inserted into the base of the second phalanx, whilst the stronger lateral slips are prolonged onwards, and, uniting with each other, gain insertion into the base of the ungual phalanx. The Extensor Longus Hallucis is placed in the interval between the tibialis anticus and the extensor longus digi- torum. In its upper part it is hidden from view by these muscles, but near the ankle it comes to the surface. It takes origin behind the extensor longus digitorum, from the anterior part of the inner surface of the shaft of the fibula in its middle two-fourths, and also from the adjoining part of the interosseous membrane. Its tendon crosses the lower part of the anterior tibial artery, and reaches the dorsum of the foot by passing downwards in front of the ankle-joint and through the anterior annular ligament. It is inserted into the dorsal aspect of the base of the ungual phalanx of the great toe.^ It is not joined by the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum. The Peroneus Tertius is a small muscle which is con- tinuous at its origin with the extensor longus digitorum. It arises from the lower fourth of the anterior part of the inner surface of the fibula, and from a corresponding extent of the interosseous membrane. It also receives fibres from the lower part of the anterior peroneal septum which inter- venes between it and the peroneus brevis. Its slender tendon is inserted into the dorsal surface of the expanded base of the fifth metatarsal bone. It is suppKed by the anterior tibial nerve. Anterior Tibial Artery.—The anterior tibial artery is the smaller of the two terminal branches of the popliteal. It takes origin on the back of the leg, at the lower border of the popliteus muscle, and it gains the anterior tibio-fibular compartment by passing forwards through the opening in the upper part of the interosseous membrane. In this part In most cases it gives a slip to the base of the proximal phalanx. VOL. I.—18

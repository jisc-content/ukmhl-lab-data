177 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY The medial part is the weakest. It is continuous posteriorly with the iigamentum laciniatinn, and is attached along the medial margin of the foot to the tarsal and first metatarsal hones. What muscles does this part cover f The lateral part is stronger than the medial. It is attached behind to the lateral tubercle of the os calcanemn and in front to the tuberosity and the lateral border of the fifth metatarsal. Posteriorly all three divisions give origin to muscles. From the deep surface of the plantar aponeurosis a medial and a lateral process are given off, which pass downward to fuse with the fascia interossea plantaris and to become attached to the tarsal hones. Three separate muscular compartments are thus formed. These septa may he seen if the plantar aponeurosis be incised in the median line from heel to toe and reflected each way. Contraction of the plantar fascia gives rise to the condition known as pes cavum. The division of the aponeurosis is most easily accomplished one inch in front of its attachments to the os calcanemn, where it is narrowest. Pus may collect beneath the fascia, and it is apt to burrow, because the aponeurosis is so dense that pus cannot perforate it. Occasionally pus may pass through one of the small foramina formed by the passage of small arteries and nerves through the aponeurosis. In this case two abscess-cavities will be formed. Such a condition is known as the ahces en hissac. Remove the aponeurosis plantaris and study the structures beneath. Fig. 72. M. flexor hall.

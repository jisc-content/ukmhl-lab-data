470 LABORATORY MANUAL OF PIUMAN ANATOMY (d) Paraduodenal fossa {fossa jmraduodenalis) (fossa of Landzert). This fossa is rarely found in the adult, occuri-iug' in a little less than three per cent, of the ca.ses. It is more frequently found in the new-born. It is situated some distance to the left of the terminal portion of the duodenum. If present, note especially its relation to the inferior mesenteric vein and the ascending branch of the left colic artery. The peritoneal folds raised by these vessels produce the fossa.

Upon what does the formation of this fossa depend? In this connection reference should again be made to the fascia of Treitz. Many anatomists recognize the existence of but one fossa at this angle. It is called the duodenojejunal fossa of Treitz. The stu- dent should refer to Poirier et Charpy, t. iv. p. 269. Peritoneal Plicae and Fossae about the Caecum. Before proceeding to a study of these plicae and fossae, some idea should be had concerning the disposition of the folds of peritoneum forming the mesentery at the iliocaecal junction. Arriving at this junction, the right leaf of the mesentery passes from the anterior surface of the ileum upon the caecum, and the left leaf takes a similar course posteriorly. They then rejoin upon the external border and inferior extremity of the caecum and the base of the appendix. In passing from the ileum to the caecum and appendix, the folds of the mesentery meet the short

T. external lateral ligament). Fig. 44. V. Using the little finger as an axis .III. Using the middle finger as an axis I. Using the thumb as an axis Schema of pronation and of supination. On the right side of the figure are reproduced three tracings by the radius and the ulna in the movements of pronation and supination, taking as an axis the thumb {!.), the middle finger {III.), and the little finger (F.). (The larger curve belongs to the radius, the smaller to the ulna.)

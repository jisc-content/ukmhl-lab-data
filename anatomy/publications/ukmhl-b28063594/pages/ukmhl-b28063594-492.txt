488 LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY Fig. 257.) What is the general direction of the valve? What coats of the intestine enter into its formation? Note— (fl) Inferior lip {labium inferius). {h) Superior lip {labium superius). (c) Frennla (“bridles” or “reins”) of valve of colon {frenula valvulae coli). What is the function of the valve? Note the location of the opening of the vermiform process into the caecum. Is it guarded by a valve {valvula processus vermiformis) ? This valve was first fully described by Gerlach Fig. 257.

The latter is closed and is cut in a frontal plane. (After Toldt, Anat. Atlas, Wien, 1900, 2 Aufl., p. 428, Fig. 709.) in 1847. According to him, it is found in the embryo, but only vestiges of it occur in the adult. Latfargue thinks that the for- mation of this valve is pathological and is due to mechanical pressure exerted by enteroliths in the lumen of the appendix. The lumen of the appendix tends to become obliterated in the adult. (Vide Fitz, Am. J. Med. 8c., 1886.) Open the vermiform process along its mesenteriolic border

PREFACE 4 Many instructors in anatomy have for some time felt the need of more systematic, more orderly, and more thorough work in the dissecting-room. Anatomy, one of the first sciences to be taught by the laboratory method, has not always kept pace with her younger sister sciences in the advance of methods of instruction. A number of laboratory manuals are, it is true, available; but it has been complained that even the best of these is unsatisfactory, partly on account of nomenclature, partly because so much is included that the student tends to lean entirely upon his manual, rather than to observe at first hand for himself and to consult larger text-books and atlases. So convinced have some anatomists become of the inadequacy of present manuals that they have banished all dissecting guides from their laboratories, and insisted upon their students work- ing with no guide whatever except large atlases and text-books and occasional hints from the instructor. This latter plan has worked very well in some instances, especially where men enter- ing upon the study of medicine had previously undergone rigid laboratory training in physics, chemistry, and biology. But even such men had to pass through a period of doubt, perplex- ity, and discouragement before they became independent dis- sectors, and some of them completely failed to do so. Students without such preliminary training in science are very apt to be utterly lost if thrown entirely or almost entirely upon their own resources, especially where classes are large and more than ten students have to be cared for by one instructor. It is believed that the use of the Laboratory Manual here presented will enable the good student to become an independent worker much more quickly than when he is left without such guidance; he will be able to do his work in less time and can assure himself that he is doing it thoroughly, using'the Manual, if he prefer, merely as a control of his work; at the same time the student who is less well-equipped will be gradually led into independent work, to which he might otherwise never attain. There should be also a marked saving of time and energy for the instructor, a matter of no little importance if he is to make

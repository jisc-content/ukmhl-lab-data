Note that the articulatio cubiti really includes three articulations: (a) Humero-iiliiar articulation {articulatio humero-ulnaris); {b) Humeroradial articulation {articulatio humeroradialis) ; (c) Proximal radio-ulnar articulation {articulatio radio-ulnar is proxi- malis). Joints {a) and {b) are studied at this stage; joint (c), a little later. Fig. 42. ^Capsiila articnlaris (anterior part) Humerocoronoid fascicle •Olecranohumeral fascicle Olecranocoronoid ■fascicle (Cooper’s ligament) ♦ Lig. coll. uln. Articulatio cubiti. (From Poirier et Charpy, Traits d’Anat. hum., Paris, 1899, 2 ed., t. i. p. G41, Fig. 650.) Study carefully the form, position, and attachments of each of the following ligaments : (a) Joint-capsule {capsula articularis). {aa) Ulnar collateral ligament {ligamentum collaterale ulnare) (0. T. internal lateral ligament). {ab) Radial collateral ligament {ligamentum collaterale radiale) (0. T. external lateral ligament). Make a transverse cut across the anterior surface of the cap- sula articularis so as to open the joint. Examine the extent of the synovial membrane. Note the continuity of the cavities of the humero-ulnar and humeroradial articulations with that of the proximal radio-ulnar articulation, all forming one joint- cavity, that of the articulatio cubiti. (See Fig. 43.)

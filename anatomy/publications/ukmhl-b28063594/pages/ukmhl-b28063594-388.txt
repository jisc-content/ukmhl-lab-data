384 LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY note that the cortical substance {substantia corticalis) is soft while the central part or nucleus of the lens {nucleus lentis) is firmer. Place a bit of the lens in thirty-three and one-third per cent, alcohol for twenty-four hours, then tease it apart and under the microscope examineâ€” {a) Epithelium of lens {epithelium lentis). (b) Fibres of lens {fibrae lentis). Chambers of Eyeball (Camerae oculi). These are two in number: (a) Anterior chamber of eyeball {camera oculi anterior). {aa) Angie of iris {angulus iridis) (0. T. iridocorneal angle). Why is this of great importance? {b) Posterior chamber of eyeball {camera oculi posterior). Study the form, position, and boundaries of each. Both con- tain the so-called aqueous humor. ORGAN OF HEARING {ORGANON AUDITUS). This consists of several parts, viz.: (a) Internal ear {auris interna). {aa) Membranous labyrinth {labyrinthus membranaceus). {ab) Osseous labyrinth {labyrinthus osseus). {b) Middle ear, {ba) Cavity of tympanum {cavum tympani). {bb) Eustachian tube {tuba auditiva '{Eustachii']). {be) Mastoid cells {cellulae mastoideae). (c) External ear {auricula) (0. T. pinna). The dry temporal bone should be thoroughly reviewed in con- nection with the study of the organ of hearing. The external ear has been studied already. (Cf. p. 258.) Take a temporal bone, preferably one with the auricula still attached to it; saw off the squama temporalis by making a horizontal cut at the level of the root of the zygomatic process; remove roof and anterior wall of the external acoustic meatus piecemeal, with the aid of bone-forceps and chisel, until the mem- brane of the tympanum is exposed.

499 LABORATORY MANUAL OP" HUMAN ANATOMY In the ascending aorta, study from the outside— (a) Bulb of aorta {hulbus aortae). (b) Sinuses of aorta {sinus aortae [Valsalvae'\). (c) Coronary arteries of heart (Aa. coronariae [cordis]). The distribution of these arteries has already been studied. Fig. 215.

Hoch- stetter.) (After Toldt, Anat. Atlas, Wien, 1901, 2 Aufl., p. 563, Fig. 938.) In connection with the arcus aortae, study its exact relations, note the isthmus aortae at its junction with the aorta descendens, and dissect out and study thoroughly the following great arterial trunks: {a) Innominate artery {A. anonyma). (aa) Lowest thyreoid artery {A. thyreoidea ima), inconstant. (b) Left common carotid artery {A. carotis communis sinistra). (c) Left subclavian artery {A. subclavia sinistra). The thoracic part of the aorta descendens will be studied later on. Cardiac Plexus (Plexus cardiacus). The superficial portion of this plexus has already been studied. Its deeper portion should next be examined. Place two ligatures about the arcus aortae at its junction with the aorta descendens and divide the aorta between them; similarly ligate twice and divide between at the junction of the arcus aortae with the aorta descendens. Cut through the V. cava superior, just below the entrance into it of the V. azygos. Divide the liga-

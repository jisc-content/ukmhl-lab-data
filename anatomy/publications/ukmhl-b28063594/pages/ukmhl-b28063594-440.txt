Pass a sound into the bladder, fill the rectum with cotton or strips of cheese-cloth, and close the anal orifice by sutures. The sound should rest upon the anterior abdominal wall, and the scrotum may be stitched to the prepuce, thus rendering the field of dissection larger. Make the following incisions (Fig. 221): (1) A transverse incision from the anterior extremity of the tuber ischi- adicum of one side to that of the other.

Skin incision, and the lithotomy position for the dissection of the perineum. At the left is shovm a convenient iron leg-support which clamps on to the edge of the table. The table-top is covered with zinc. Superficial Perineal Fascia (Fascia superficialis perinei). (Figs. 222, 227-229.) Note the general characteristics of this fascia in the regio analis. In the regio urogenitalis it will be found to consist of

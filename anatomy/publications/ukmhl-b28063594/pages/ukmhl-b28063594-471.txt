467 ABDOMEN AND BELYIS the abdominal cavity as the parietal peritoneum {peritonaeum par let ale) and covers the viscera as the visceral peritoneum {peritonaeum viscerale). The space between these two layers, which exists only upon dissection, is the peritoneal cavity {cavum peritonaei). In the male this is completely closed, but in the female it communicates with the exterior through the abdominal openings of the Fallopian tubes. Great Omentum (Omentum majus). (Figs. 245, 258.) What is its position and form and of what tissue is it com- posed! AVhat is its relation to that part of the large intestine passing transversely across the abdomen {colon transversum) 1 Is its relation in the adult the same as in the embryo! How is it re- Fig. 246.

The great extent of the bursa omentalis is due to its lodging, at this level, the pro- jecting lobus caudatus [Spigelii].

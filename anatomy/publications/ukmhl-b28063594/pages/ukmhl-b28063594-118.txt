114 LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY are concerned in flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction of the hand? Of what especial advantage are the multiple bones and joints of the carpus? Radio-ulnar Joints. (See Figs. 44, 45, and 46.) These joints consist of— (a) Proximal radio-ulnar articulation {articulatio radio-ulnaris proxi- malis) (0. T. superior radio-ulnar). Fig. 40. The interosseous membrane of the forearm, volar surface. (After Poirier et Charpy, Traits d’Anat. hum., Paris, 1899, t. i. p. 655, Fig. 661.) (6) Distal radio-ulnar articulation {articulatio radio-ulnaris distalis) (0. T. inferior radio-ulnar). (c) Interosseous membrane and oblique cord {memhrana interossea anti- hracliii et chorda obliqua). To expose the ligaments, the muscles must be completely re- moved from the dorsal and volar surfaces of the forearm. (a) Proximal radio-ulnar joint. What bony surfaces are concerned?

13 ‘ 193 HEAD AND NECK Introductory. Make three drawings of the head {caput) and neck (collum) : (a) anterior view, (h) posterior view, (c) lateral view. Distin- guish the portion corresponding to the skull proper {cranium) from the face {facies). Indicate the highest point of the head {vertex)^ separating the anterior part of the head {sinciput) from the posterior part {occiput). Note that the occiput is covered with hair; the sinciput also with the exception of its anterior inferior portion, the forehead {frons). Laterally, the temples {tempora) are naked in front but covered with hair behind. The external ears {auriculae) are attached to the cranium. In the drawings of the face (cf. Spalteholz, Fig. 513) label the nose {nasus) with its tip {apex nasi), back {dorsum nasi), and wings {alae nasi). Note the openings into the nose {nares) and the partition between {septum nasi). In the region of the mouth {regio oralis), draw the upper and lower lips {labia superius et inferius) which bound the mouth-slit {rima oris). Indicate exactly the furrow {sulcus nasolahialis) running down- ward from each ala nasi and separating the region of the mouth from that of the cheek {bucca); also, the curved transverse fur- row {sidcus mentolabialis) separating the region of the mouth from the chin {mentum). Fill in with care the details in the eye- regions {regiones orbitales), bounded above at the junction with the frons by the eyebrow {supercilium) and below at the junction with the bucca by the infrapalpebral furrow {sidcus infrapalpe- brails). Label the upper and lower eyelids {palpebrae superior et inferior) and the slit between them {rima palpebrarum), through which the anterior part of the eyeball {bulbus oculi) is visible. Beneath the cheek, on each side, notice the region below the lower jaw {regio submaxillaris) and beneath the chin another area {regio sid)mentalis). Note the deep depression {fossa retromandibidaris) below the ear and behind the lower jaw. Ex- amine the four cavities of the face,—the two eye-cavities {orbdae), the nasal cavity {cavum nasi) divided by the septum,

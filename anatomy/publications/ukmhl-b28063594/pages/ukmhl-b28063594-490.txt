486 LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY and adult types of caeca? How does the caecum differ in carnivora and lierbivora? (Vide Poirier et Charpy, t. iv. p. 323.) (b) Vermiform process or appendix {processus vermiformis). What is the average length of the appendix? What is its relation to the caecum? What positions may the process occupy? (c) Colon. (ca) Ascending colon {colon ascendens). {cb) Right colic flexure {ftexura coli dextra). {cc) Transverse colon {colon transversum). {cd) Left colic flexure {flexura coli sinistra). {ce) Descending colon {colon descendens). {cf) Sigmoid colon {colon sigmoideum) (0. T. sigmoid flexure). Note carefully the relation of each of these parts to the neigh- boring viscera. Note especially the relation to the kidneys, duo- denum, pancreas, stomach, and spleen. Free the remaining portions of the intestine, as far as the left sacro-iliac synchondrosis. Apply two ligatures there and cut between. Take the intestines to the sink, remove the ligatures, and wash out the contents. Then proceed to the study of the following external features (cf. Fig. 256) : % (a) Bands of the colon {taeniae coli). {aa) Mesocolic band {taenia mesocolica). {ab) Omental band {taenia omentalis). {ac) Free band {taenia libera). Note the relation of the taeniae to the base of the appendix and the caecum. Compare specimen with models and determine the number of taeniae to be found upon the rectum. {b) Sacculations of colon {haustra coli). Compare the size of the sacculations upon the caecum, colon ascendens, and colon sigmoideum. Which are the largest? How is their formation explained? (c) Epiploic [fatty] appendages {appendices epiploicae). How many series do you And upon the colon ascendens and colon descendens? Along which taeniae are they arranged? How many series do you find on the colon transversum? Remove a section of the colon ascendens, open it, and clean its mucous surface; pin down upon a cork tray and study its coats. (a) Serous coat {tunica serosa). Lias the colon ascendens a complete serous coat? What relation do the appendices epiploicae bear to this coat? {b) Muscular coat {tunica muscularis). {ba) Longitudinal layer {stratum longitudinale). Note that the longitudinal muscular fibres are collected together, forming the taeniae. A complete, but thin, con- tinuous longitudinal layer of muscle will also be found. {bb) Circular layer {stratum circulare).

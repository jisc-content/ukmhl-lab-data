ABDOMEN AND PELVIS 479 (c) Inferior mesenteric plexus {plexus mesentericus inferior). Dissect out carefully the filaments of the sympathetic nerves sur- rounding the branches of the artery and trace them to the intes- tinal wall. What relation do they bear to the aortic plexus {plexus aorticus abdominalis) ? Study the latter now also. Fig. 250. A. colica media A. mesenterica superior A. mesenterica inferior A. colica sinistra Ramus descendens A. haemorrhoidalis superior The inferior mesenteric artery. The small intestine has been laid over to the right. The transverse colon has been turned upward and the sigmoid flexure spread out. (After Gegenhaur, Lehrb. der Anat. des Mensch., Leipzig, 1899, 7 Aufl., Bd. ii. p. 279, Fig. &42.) {d) Left mesocolic lymphatics. Do you find any lymph-nodes'? What is the course and destina- tion of the lymphatics draining the colon descendens and colon sigmoideum ? Mesenterial Small Intestine (Intestinum tenue mesenteriale). That portion of the small intestine which in the adult is at- tached to the posterior abdominal wall by a mesentery is known as the intestinum tenue mesenteriale. (Vide Figs. 251-3 and Spalteholz, Figs. 565, 566, 568, 569.) It is arbitrarily divided into an upper one-third (two-fifths,

443 ABDOMEN AND PELVIS (be) The third lamella covers the deep transverse muscle of the perineum superiorly. It extends from the urethra in the median line to the line extending' between the tuljer ischiadi- cuni of each side posteriorly. The anterior border is inti- mately adherent to the urethra, while the posterior gives off processes which are united to the inferior aponeurosis of the levator ani muscle. It is also intimately adherent to the central tendinous point of the perineum. Fig. 229. Duct, def Allantoic M. obturat. int.tJ.; M. lev. ani— Umbilico-vesical apon. oljturatoria Arcus tend.

Frontal section through the bulbus urethrae. (From Poirier et Charpy, Traits d’Anat. hum., Paris, 1901, t. v., fasc. 1, p. 218, Fig. 147.) Remove the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm {fascia diaphragmatis urogenitalis inferior) on one side and note the contents of the middle perineal compartment’^ (0. T. space between the two layers of triangular ligament). Muscles. (Vide Figs. 226 and 229, and Spalteholz, Fig. 673.) (a) Deep transverse muscle of perineum {M. transversus perinei pro- fundus). What is the general direction of the fibres composing this muscle? What is the relation to the perineal body? (Vide Poirier et Charpy, t. v. p. 202.) {h) Sphincter muscle of the membranous urethra {M. sphincter urethrae membranaceae). It is also known as the “striated sphincter of the urethra.” Consult Poirier et Chai'py, t. v. p. 204, concerning the disposition of the fibres forming this muscle. Arteries. (Vide Fig. 224, and Spalteholz, Fig. 473.) (a) Artery of the penis {A. penis). (aa) Artery of bulb of urethra (A. bulbi urethrae). (ab) Urethral artery (A. urethralis). (ac) Deep artery of penis (A. profunda penis). {ad) Dorsal artery of penis (A. dorsalis penis). Determine the exact relation of each artery. Dissect out the veins accompanying each, carefully noting relations and anastomoses. What is the course of the dorsal vein of the penis (F. dorsalis penis), and into what does it empty?

DISSECTION OE THE UPPER EXTREMPTY 101 aponeurosis palmaris. Note its attachments ulnarward and medialward. Study the relations of its deep and superficial sur- faces. Wliat is the canal beneath it called and what structures pass through this canal! Flexor Tendons and their Mucous Sheaths. (Cf. Spalteholz, Fig. 366.) (a) Mucous sbeatli of common flexor tendons {vagina [mucosa] tendinum Mm. fiexorum communium) (0. T. synovial sheath). If uninjured by dissection thus far, insert a blow-pipe into sheath proximal to ligamentum carpi transversum and inflate. Study the exact relations to the flexor tendons in your cadaver and compare with text-book descriptions. (Cf. Fig. 37.) Fig. 37. Palmar synovial sheaths (vaginae tendinum), normal adult type. (From Poirier et Charpy, Traits d’Anat. hum., Paris, 1901, 2 ed., t. ii. p. 190, Fig. 147.) (6) Mucous sheath of tendon of long flexor of thumb {vagina tendinis M. flexoris pollicis longi). (c) Digital sheaths of the tendons {vaginae tendinum digitales). Note also the pairs of small folds extending between the first and second phalanges and the digital sheaths; these are the so- called “bands of union of the tendons” {vincula tendinum). They carry the blood-vessels to the tendons.

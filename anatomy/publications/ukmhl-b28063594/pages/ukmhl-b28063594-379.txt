This includes the eyeball {hulhus oculi), the optic nerve {N. opticus), and the accessory organs of the eyeball {organa oculi accessoria). The latter, including the extrinsic muscles of the eye, orbital fasciae, eyelids and eyebrows, conjunctiva, and lacri- mal apparatus, as well as the optic nerve, have already been studied.

Schematic section in the horizontal meridian of the right eyeball, (After Toldt, Anat. Atlas, Wien, 1903, 3 Aufl., p. 892, Fig. 1334.) others after hardening in formalin. Sections in different planes should be made of eyeballs hardened in formalin. These may easily be permanently preserved in formalin gelatin. The eye- balls should first be cleaned. Remove the conjunctiva, eye- muscles, fat, and capsule of Tenon. This is best done by grasp- ing the conjunctiva and fascia bulbi with the point of the forceps close to the limbus corneae and snipping through them with fine

52 LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY (b) (c) (d) (e) if) (g) Compare the distance between the acromion and the ster- nal extremity of the clavicle on the two sides. Why would such a comparison be of importance in surgical diagnosis? Outline of sternum. (ba) Manubrium sterni. Jugular notch {incisura jugularis) (0. T. suprasternal notch). (bh) Corpus sterni (0. T. gladiolus). Angie of sternum {angulus sterni) (0. T. angulus Ludovici, angle of Louis), an important landmark in counting ribs and intercostal spaces. {be) Processus xiphoideus (0. T. ensiform process). Costal arches I.-XII. (ca) Ribs (costae I.-XII.). {cb) Costal cartilages {cartilagines costales). Is a “ rickety rosary’’ present ? Coracoid process of scapula {processus coracoideus scapulae). Note its relation to the infraclavicular fossa {fossa infraclavicularis or Mohrenheim’s fossa) and the relation of the clavicular origins of the M. pectoralis major and the M. deltoideus to the latter. Breast {mamma). {ea) Papilla mammae, or nipple of the breast. Note its exact level and its distance from the anterior median line. {eb) Body of breast {corpus mammae). Note its dimensions. {ec) Areola mammae. (1) Sebaceous glands {Gl. sebaceae). (2) Areolar glands {Gl. areolares [Montgomerii]). {ed) Accessory breasts {mammae accessoriae). Are any present? W^hat is the direction of the so-called “milk-line”? Note that of the two rows of milk-glands running from the forelimb to the inguinal fold, the head- ward portions are preserved in primates, the tailward por- tions in ruminants. W^hat are meant by the terms polg- mastism, polgtlielism, and atavism? Boundaries of axillary fossa (upper extremity abducted). {fa) Anterior axillary fold {plica axillaris anterior). To what is it due? {fb) Posterior axillary fold {plica axillaris posterior). To what is it due? Which fold extends to the lower level ? Upper extremity of humerus. Palpate, in the axillaiy fossa, the medial surface of the surgical neck {collum chirurgicum) and feel the head of the humerus {caput humeri) rotate when the arm is rotated. Skin and Superficial Fascia, with Vessels and Nerves. Make the following incisions in the skin (cf. Fig. 7) : {a) In the linea mediana anterior from the fossa jugularis to the tip of the processus xiphoideus.

(a) Siiperhcial transverse muscle of perineum (M. transversus perinei superficialis). In the embryo and child this muscle is well developed and con- stant in its relations. In the adult the muscle varies in size, strength, and position; in the foetus muscle bands are found connecting it to the M. sphincter ani externus and the M. ischio- cavernosus, and it may be regarded as a connecting link between anal musculature and the musculature of the urogenital region. In the adult it seems to be underging retrogressive changes. Fig. 223. Lig. sacrotuberosum M. coccygeus Lig. sacrotuberosum M. sphincter ani, ext.

(From Gegenbaur, Lehrb. der Anat. des Mensch., Leipzig, 1899, 7 Aufl., Bd. ii. p. 197, Fig. 496.) (h) Ischiocavernous muscle {M. ischiocavernosus) (0. T. erector penis muscle). According to Merkel, the tendon of this muscle fuses, as a rule, with the lower and lateral surfaces of the fibrous tunic of the corpora cavernosa. At times a tendinous slip is given off, which fuses with a corresponding process from the opposite side, on the dorsum of the penis, and thus forms a loop about the dorsal vein of the penis. These processes may be muscular. If so, they are called the “ compressor muscle of the dorsal vein of the penis” (M. compressor venae dorsalis penis).

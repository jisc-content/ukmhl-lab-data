104 LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY (ac) A. metacarpca volaris HI. (0. T. second palmar interosseous), forward between third and fourth phalanges to join A. digitalis communis. (ad) A. metacarpea volaris IW (0. T. third palmar interosseous), forward between fourth and fifth phalanges to join A. digitalis communis. Note rami perforantes given off by each volar metacarpal artery. Study the formation of the volar carpal network {rete carpi volare) (0. T. anterior carpal rete). DORSAL SURFACE AND RADIAL MARGIN OF FORE- ARM {FACIES DORSALIS ET MARGO RADIALIS ANTIBRACHII), The skin and superficial fascia with their nerves and blood- vessels have already been studied. The fat of the superficial fascia should now be completely removed and the deep fascia studied. Dorsal Portion of Deep Fascia of Forearm (Fascia antibrachii). How is it attached above and below! Note the relation of its deep surface to the extensor muscles. The dorsal ligament of the carpus {ligamentum carpi dor sale) (0. T. posterior annular ligament) is really a part of it. Superficial Muscles of Dorsum of Forearm. Dissect away the deep fascia on the dorsum of the forearm, with the exception of that portion of it near the elbow overlying and giving origin to muscles underneath. The ligamentum carpi dorsale should also be preserved. Isolate as far as possible and clean the surfaces of the following muscles: (a) Brachioradial muscle {M. brachioradialis) (0. T. supinator longus). (b) Long radial extensor muscle of carpus (ilf. extensor carpi radiaUs longus). (c) Short radial extensor muscle of carpus {M. extensor carpi radialis brevis). (ca) Bursa M. extensoris carpi radialis brevis (Spalteliolz, Fig. 360). {d) Common extensor muscle of fingers (BI. extensor digitorum com- munis). Study juncturae tendinum later. (e) Proper extensor muscle of fifth finger (M. extensor digiti quinti proprius) (0. T. extensor minimi digiti).

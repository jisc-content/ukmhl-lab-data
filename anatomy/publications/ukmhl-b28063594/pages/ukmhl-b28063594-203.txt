DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK 199 into the superior sagittal sinus and pull the hemisphere gently lateralward. The falx cerebri may now be examined. Falx Cerebri. Examine its extent. How is it formed! To what is it at- tached! Note that it contains three of the sinuses of the dura mater {sinus durae matris), as follows: (a) Superior sagittal sinus {sinus sagittalis superior) (vide supra). {h) Inferior sagittal sinus {sinus sagittalis inferior) (0. T. inferior longitudinal sinus). (c) Straight sinus {sinus rectus). Venous space i Fig. 84. Sinus sagittalis superior Diploe Dura mater enceph. Granul. arachnoid. Cav. subarach.

Transverse section (magnified) passing through the falx cerebri, and showing the skull, meninges, and cortex cerebri. (From Poirier et Charpy, Traits d’Anat. hum., Paris, 1899, t. iii., 1, p. 143, Fig. 98.) Removal of Brain. Cut through the attachment of the falx cerebri to the basis cranii interna in front and pull it backward. Let the head hang over the end of the table; support the occipital regions of the brain in the left hand. The frontal lobes will fall away from the floor of the skull; if the bulbi olfactorii remain adherent, sepa- rate them from the lamina cribrosa of the ethmoid bone with the handle of a scalpel; this easily tears across the Nn. olfactorii, which, coming through the lamina cribrosa from the nose, here plunge into the olfactory bulb to terminate there.

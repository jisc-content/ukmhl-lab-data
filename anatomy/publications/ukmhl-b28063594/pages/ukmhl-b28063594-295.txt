291 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK Fauces. (a) Isthmus of fauces {isthmus faucium). {h) Palatine curtain {velum palatinum). (c) Uvula {uvula palatinum). This little body is often cut off by the surgeon if it becomes so relaxed and lengthened that it causes continued ticklingâ€™ of the throat. . {d) Palatine arches {arcus palatini). {da) Glossopalatine arch {arcus glossopalatinus) (0. T. ante- rior pillar of fauces). {db) Pharyngopalatine arch {arcus pharyngopalatinus) (0. T. posterior pillar of fauces). {e) Tubopalatine or salpingopalatine fold {plica salpingopalatina). This cannot be seen well until later, when the pharynx is opened from behind. (/) Palatine tonsil {tonsilla palatina) (0. T. ordinary tonsil). This will be studied later. The muscles of the palate and fauces will be studied with those of the pharynx. PHARYNX. Place the chin of the cadaver on a block with the pharynx hanging downward, its posterior surface turned towards dis- sector. Distend the cavity of the pharynx with cotton or tow. Buccopharyngeal Fascia (Fascia buccopharyngea). (a) Pterygomandibular raphe {raphe pterygomandibularis) (0. T. ptery- gomaxillary ligament). This will be seen as a dense cord between the hamulus pterygoideus and the posterior end of the crista buc- cinatoria [mandibulae]). Observe that the part of the fascia in front of {a) covers the M. buccinatorius, that behind (a) covers the muscles of the pharynx. Muscular Tunic of Pharynx (Tunica muscularis pharyngis). Study the form, position, origin, insertion, action, and inner- vation of each of the following muscles : {a) Inferior constrictor muscle of pharynx (M. constrictor pharyngis inferior). {aa) Thyreopharyngeal muscle {M. thyreopharyngeus). {ah) Cricopharyngeal muscle (M. cricopharyngeus). {h) Middle constrictor muscle of pharynx {M. constrictor pharyngis medius). {ha) Chondropharyngeal muscle (71/. chondropharyngeus) (from cornu minus os. hyoid.). {bb) Ceratopharyngeal muscle (71/. ceratopharyngeus) (from cornu majus os. hyoid.).

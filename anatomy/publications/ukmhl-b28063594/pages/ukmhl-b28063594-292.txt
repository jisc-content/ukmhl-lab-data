LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY 288 Detach this from the epistropheus and reflect it upward. Study the following: (cc) Cruciform ligament of atlas {ligamentum cruciatum atlantis). Observe its two parts (cf. Spalteholz, vol. i., Fig. 218) : (cca) Transverse ligament {ligamentum transversum at- lantis). (ccb) Vertical part. Detach the vertical part, reflect it downward, and studyâ€” (cd) Alar ligaments {ligamenta alaria) (0. T. odontoid or check ligaments). {ce) Ligament of apex of tooth {ligamentum apicis dentis) (0. T. suspensory ligament). How is this ligament related to the chorda dorsalis? Name from before backward the ligaments of the articulatio atlanto-occipitalis and articulatio atlanto-epistrophica. (Cf. Spalteholz, p. 169.) What movements can occur at these joints? What muscles are concerned in such movements ? How is excessive movement in any direction checked ? MOUTH AND FAUCES. Returning to the forepart of the skull and neck, the dissector now studies the following, comparing his findings in the cadaver with illustrations in atlases and descriptions in his systematic text-book. Cavity of Mouth (Cavum oris). General. (a) Cheek (bucca). (aa) Fat body of cheek {corpus adiposum huccae). {b) Entrance to mouth {vestihulum oris). This is bounded in front and laterally by lips and cheeks, behind by teeth and gums. (c) Mouth cavity proper {cavum oris proprium). This is internal to the teeth. {d) Mouth slit or oral fissure {rima oris). {e) Lips of mouth {labia oris). {ea) Upper lip {labium superius). {eb) Lower lip {labium inferius). {f) Junction of lips {commissura labiorum). {g) Angles of mouth {angulus oris). {h) Palate {palatum). {ha) Hard palate {palatum durum). {hh) Soft palate {palatum molle). {he) Middle ridge of palate {raphe palati).

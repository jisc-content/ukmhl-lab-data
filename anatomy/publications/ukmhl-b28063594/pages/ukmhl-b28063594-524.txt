The lower aperture of the pelvis is closed by the pelvic dia- phragm, which consists mainly of the M. levator ani with a layer of fascia above it and another beneath it. The inferior fascia of the pelvic diaphragm {fascia dia- phragmatis pelvis inferior) has already been studied in the dis- section of the ischiorectal fossa, and its relation to the obturator fascia {fascia ohturatoria) and the arcus tendineus M. levatoris Fig. 274.

493 ABDOMEN AND PELVIS What are its peritoneal relations! Examine— (a) Duodciiorenal ligament {Ugamentum duodenorenale). {b) Duodenoeolic ligament {Ugamentum duodenocolicum). (Inconstant.) The latter has been dissected away. Examine model and other cadavers and determine its location, if present. Fig. 259. Pars superior duodeiii—- Flexura duodeni Flexiira duodeni inferior Pars horizontalis (inferior) duodeni -—.Pylorus Pars pylorica ventriculi Papilla duodeni (Santorini) Plicae (Kerkringi) Flexura duodeno- jejunalis —Intestinum jejunum -- Pars ascendens duodeni Pars duodeni Noduli lymph- atici solitarii Plica longitudi- nalis duodeni The duodenum seen from in front. The descending part has been cut open and its anterior wall turned back to the left. (After Toldt, Anat. Atlas, Wien, 1900, 2 Aufl., p. 424, Fig. 694.) The duodenum is never displaced en masse, for the flexura duodenojejunalis is attached to the vertebral column. The first two portions are often displaced laterally or prolapsed second- ary to the downward displacement of the stomach and liver. Determine by what means the duodenum is held in position. Dissect out the suspensory muscle of the duodenum {M. sus- pensorius duodeni). This muscle was described by Treitz in 1853. It arises from the supe- rior border of the flexura duodenojejunalis and the superior half of the pars ascendens. Passing upward behind the head of the pancreas and in front of the aorta, it is attached to the left pillar of the diaphragm by a tendon composed of elastic and flbrous tissue. It is composed of smooth muscle-fibres. According to Braune, it is derived from both coats of the intestine.

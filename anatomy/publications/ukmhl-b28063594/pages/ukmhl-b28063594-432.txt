428 LABORATORY Mv\.NUAL OR HUMAN ANATOMY Each ductulus alveolaris with all its branches makes up a lobule of the lung {lohulus pulmonis). The term “ lobule” as used by the pathologists includes several of these anatomical lohuli. Note the central position of the terminal branch of the A. pulmonis and the peripheral distribution of the roots of the pulmonaiy veins in each lobulus pulmonis. Thoracic Portion of Sympathetic Nervous System. Remove the pleura parietalis from the sides of the vertebral column and from the inner surface of the ribs. Dissect out the thoracic portion of the sympathetic nervous system {pars tho- racalis S. sympathici). Study— (a) Thoracic ganglia {ganglia thoracalia). How many are there? How are they located? (b) Great splanchnic nerve {N. splanchnicus major). How is it formed? Where does it leave the thorax? Find— (ba) Splanchnic ganglion {ganglion splancJinicum). (c) Small splanchnic nerve {N. splanchnicus minor). How is it formed? How does it leave the thorax? In the abdomen it gives off a renal ramns {ramus renalis). {d) Lowermost splanchnic nerve {N. splanchnicus imus). The plexus aorticus thoracalis, plexus cardiacus, plexus coro- narii, rami pulmonales, and plexus pulmonalis have been studied already. Wall of Thorax from within. Examine the Mm. intercostales interni and the ligamenta intercostalia interna from within. Clean, isolate, and study— {a) Subcostal muscles {Mm. subcostales). {b) External intercostal muscles {Mm. intercostales externi). These can be exposed from within by removing the ligamenta intercostalia interna in one or two intercostal spaces. (c) Intercostal arteries from the aorta {Aa. intercostales). The rami posteriores can now be examined at their origins. {d) Highest intercostal artery from the subclavian (A. intercostalis su- prema). {e) Intercostal nerves {Nn. intercostales) = anterior rami of thoracic nerves {rami anteriores Nn. thoraealium). Examine their proximal portions. {f) Intercostal veins {Vv. intercostales). Study carefully the differences in termination on the two sides. {g) Azygos vein {vena azygos) (0. T. vena azygos major). (Cf. Fig. 205.)

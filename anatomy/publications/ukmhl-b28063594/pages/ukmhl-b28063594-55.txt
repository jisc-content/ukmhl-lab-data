51 DISSECTION OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY Broad Muscles of the Back (Second Layer). Make the rhomboid muscles tense and clean their surfaces carefully. Find the trunk of the dorsal nerve of the scapula (N. dorsalis scapulae) (0. T. nerve to the rhomboids) and the descending ramiis of the transverse artery of the neck (A. trans- versa colli) in the interval between the M. levator scapulae and the M. rhomboideus minor. (a) Greater rhomboid muscle (31. rhomboideus major). (h) Lesser rhomboid muscle (31. rhomboideus minor). (c) Levator muscle of scapula (31. levator scapulae) (0. T. levator anguli scapulae). Establish the form, position, origin, insertion, action, and innervation of each. Find the two rami of the cervical nerve on the surface of the M. levator scapulae and then cut the muscle in two in the middle. Reflect the lower portion lateralward. Cut through the attachments of the Mm. rhomboidei near the median plane and reflect the muscles lateralward. Dissect out care- fully— (a) Dorsal nerve of scapula (N. dorsalis scapulae). (b) Descending ramus of transverse arteiy of neck (ramus descendens A. transversae colli) (0. T. posterior scapular artery). Near the superior margin of the scapula expose the inferior belly of the omohyoid muscle {venter inferior M. omohyoidei). Define its exact attachment to the scapula. Note the relations of the A. transversa scapulae (0. T. suprascapular artery) and of the N. suprascapularis to the Lig. transversum scapulae superius. The dissector of the arm may next assist the dissector of the head in making out the muscles of the back. Study the form, position, origin, insertion, action, and innervation of each. ANTERIOR THORACIC REGION AND AXILLARY FOSSA. Surface Anatomy. Examine— (a) Outline of clavicle. (aa) Shaft of clavicle. (ab) Sternal extremity (e xt remit as sternalis). (ac) Acromial extremity (extremitas acromialis).

DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK 359 (1) Prefrontal section^ passing’ through the front of the lobus frontalis about tive centimetres in front of the sulcus centralis and parallel to it. (2) Operculof rontal or pediculofrontal section, through the pars opercu- laris of the gyrus frontalis inferior and the corresponding portions of the gyrus frontalis medius and gyrus frontalis superior; in other words, through the “ feet” of the frontal gyri. (3) Frontal section, through the middle of the gyrus centralis anterior. (4) First parietal section, through the middle of the gyrus centralis pos- terior. (5) Second parietal or pediculoparietal section, through the anterior ex- tremities (“feet”) of the lobulus parietalis superior and lobulus parietalis inferior. (6) Occipital section, about one centimetre in front of the fissura parieto- occipitalis. Fig. 170. Operculofrontal / Frontal pjrst parietal It will be advantageous to the student while studying anat- omy to become familiar with these obliquely frontal sections, as well as with the vertical frontal, for it is the former that are more often employed at the autopsy table of the pathological laboratories. The prefrontal section shows the cortex and white matter of the three frontal gyri, the orbital gyri, and the medial surface of the frontal lobe. The pediculo frontal section passes through the three frontal gyri, anterior end of island, orbital gyrus, corpus callosum, caput nuclei caudati, ante- rior part of nucleus lentiformis, and lenticulostriate part of capsula interna. ^ The lines indicating the planes of the sections slope too much in this figure.

LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY 446 attachment of the deep layer? Does it acquire smooth muscle fibres in the labium majus to form a tunica dartos! Study— Arteries. (a) Artery of perineum {A. perinei). Trace this artery forward to the labia majora and dissect out— (act) Postei’ior labial arteries {Aa. labiates posteriores). Look for a small artery passing' into the superficial transverse muscle of the perineum, the “ transverse perineal artery.” Nerves. (Fig. 232.) Fig. 231.

(aa) Posterior labial nerves (Nn. labiates posteriores). (b) Perineal branches of posterior cutaneous nerve of thigh (0. T. small sciatic). Lymphatics. Determine the course of the lymphatics found in this region, also the lymph-nodes with which they communicate. (Vide Toldt, Fig. 1093.) Remove this fascia and expose to view the contents of the superficial perineal compartment” (between fascia perinealis and diaphragma urogenitale). (Cf. Figs. 227, 229.) Clean off the fascia from the muscles, determine the form, position, origin, insertion, action, and nerve-supply of the fol- lowing : Muscles. (Vide Spalteholz, Fig. 669.) (a) Superficial transverse muscle of perineum (M. transversus perinei superfi,cialis). This muscle is not constant. It is found in the female in a little more than thirty per cent, of the cases. In the male it is more frequent.

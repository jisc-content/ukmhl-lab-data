/ ABDOMEN AND PELVIS 551 JOINTS OF THE PELVIS. In studying the following joints determine the general char- acteristics of the bony surfaces entering into their formation. Study the movements which occur between the joint surfaces, the muscles which produce these movements, and the mechanism by which they are restricted. Pay particular attention to the Fig. 296.

Re- view the bursae which you have found in your previous dissec- tion, and establish their relations to the joints. If the ligaments have dried, their dissection may be rendered easier by soaking

Where are they most nunierous'? (c) Intestinal glands {GL inlestinales [Lieberkuehni]) (O. T. crypts of Lieberkuehn). Look for their oritices witli a lens. (d) Solitary lymph-nodules {noduli liimphatici solilarii). They are en- larged in many of the acute infectious diseases so as to be easily visible. (e) Aggregated l^miph-nodules of Peyer, or Peyer’s patches {noduli hjm- phatici aggregati [Pegeri']). These should he studied carefully and a correct idea of normal appearance be gained. They are the seat of pathological changes in typhoid fever and often also in tuberculosis. Notice that they are situated opposite the mesenteric attachment. They are most easily found if the bowel is held to the light. They number from thirty-five to forty (Sappey; fifteen to fifty, Frey). What is their general form? Measure an elliptical patch and note in drawing-book the measurements. What is the general appearance of a patch? How is its long axis directed? (Vide Fig. 255.) Fig. 255.

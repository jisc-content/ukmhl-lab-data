DISSECTION OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY 59 (c) Its origin. (ca) Pars claviciilaris. (ch) Pars sternocostalis. (cc) Pars abdomiiialis. {d) Its insertion. {e) Its innervation {Nn. ihoracales anteriores). {f) The bursa M, pectoralis majoris. Look up an article upon the torsion of the tendon of this muscle by Dr. Warren Lewis, in the American Journal of Anatomy. Fig. 12. The brachial and axillary arches. (From Poirier et Charpy, Traite d’Anat. hum., Paris, 1901, 2 ed., p. 164, Fig. 126.) Axillary Fascia (Fascia axillaris). (Figs. 12 and 13.) Carefully remove the superficial fascia over the base of the axillary fossa so as to expose the deep or axillary fascia. Note— (a) An apparent oval opening between the concave aponeurotic bands; the lower lateral concave band is the brachial arch {Armbogen of Langer) ; the upper medial concave band is the axillary arch {Achselbogen of Langer). If the dissection be made very care- fully, a delicate, much-perforated membrane can be made out, ex- tending from the brachial arch to the axillary arch, so that the bundle of vessels and nerves seen through the oval opening is not really subcutaneous.

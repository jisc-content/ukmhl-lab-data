46 LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY fascia. With the special heavy probe recommended, separate an ^rea of the superficial fascia until you encounter the trunk of a blood-vessel or a nerve coming through the deep fascia from below to enter the superficial fascia. It is common to find a nerve, an artery, and a vein together. Carefully separate the structure or structures found from the superficial fascia, tracing the blood-vessel or nerve as far as possible and cleaning it thor- oughly. In this way, isolate all the superficial blood-vessels and nerves in the medial and lateral areas in which they occur. The nerves and blood-vessels will be found emerging through the deep fascia. Their course and ramifications in the superficial fascia are to be traced out with- out removing the fat or disturb- ing the relations of the struct- ures any more than is necessary in exposing them. It should be borne in mind that it is only the natural relations that are of im- portance, and not the artificial relations due to dissection. Hence each structure should he studied as it is worked out, in- stead of its study being deferred until after it is isolated and cleaned. When the cutaneous nerves and vessels and superfi- cial glands have been thus ex- posed, a drawing of these should be made; or the drawing may he made concurrently with the dissection, being then an aid to the determination of the exact relations. The deep fascia should be cleaned (by careful removal of the superficial fascia by blunt dissection) and its extent, nature, and attachments studied. The fasciae should then be removed piece- meal. In cleaning the surface of the muscles, place the body in such a position that the muscle-fibres will he rendered tense and carry the knife in the direction which permits removal of the fascia with the least disturbance of the underlying muscle.

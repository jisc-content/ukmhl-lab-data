273 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NE(Tv Cavernous Sinus (Sinus cavernosus). (Vide Fig. 114.) Where is it situated? What are its boundaries? What im- portant structures pass through it? Note the following tribu- taries : {a) Superior ophthalmic vein (F. ophthalmica superior). {b) Inferior ophthalmic vein ( F. ophthalmica inferior). (c) Sphenoparietal sinus {sinus sphenoparietalis). Arteries of the Region. (a) Internal carotid artery (A. carotis interna). How does it enter the cranial cavity? Study its course. {aa) Ophthalmic artery (A. ophthalmica). (Vide Fig’. 117.) Fig. 114. N. oculomolorius Histological section pas-sing in a frontal plane through the hypophysis, adult (after Langer). (From Poirier et Charpy, Trait6 d’Anat. hum., Paris, 1901, 2 ed., t. ii. p. 767, Fig. 497.) (6) Middle meningeal artery {A. meningea media). Through what open- ing does it enter the middle cranial fossa ? In what portion of your dissection did you meet with the origin of this artery ? Find the following branches: (ba) Superficial petrosal ramus {ramus petrosus superficialis). {bb) Superior tympanic artery {A. tympanica superior). (c) Accessoiy meningeal ramus {ramus meningeus accessorius) of A. meningea media. Look for it entering the skull through the fora- men ovale. Nerves of the Region. (a) Trigeminal nerve {N. trigeminus) (0. T. N. cerebralis V.). Observe the exact position of the larger portion {portio major) (sensory) and of the smaller portion {portio minor) (motor) and their relations to the semilunar gan- glion {ganglion semilunare [Gassen]) (0. T. Gasserian ganglion), the cells of which give origin to the sensory fibres of the nerve (vide Fig. 115). Read carefully a de- scription of the semilunar ganglion in your systematic text- 18

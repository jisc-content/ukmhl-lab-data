ABDOMEN AND PELVIS pubis to the spina iscliiadica. Demonstrate that medialward from the arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis the greater part of the fascia is reflected upon the viscera (urinary bladder and rectum) and venous plexuses about them as the endopelvic fascia {fascia endopelvina), and that other strands of fascia follow the medial surface of the levator as far as the prostate, where they fuse with the capsule of the latter organ, sometimes called the fascia prostatae. English writers describe the fascia endopel- vina as consisting of three layers,—(1) vesical, (2) rectovesical, and (3) rectal. Fig. 278. Diagram of the fasciae of the pelvis shown in a horizontal section of the pelvis. The fascia vesic. sem., fascia rectovesica, and fascia recti prop, are parts of the fascia endopelvina. (After Holl, in Handb. der Anat. des Mensch. von Bardeleben, Jena, 18%, Bd. vii., T. 2, Abt. 2, p. 285, Fig. 34.) Demonstrate that the fascia descends deeper between the an- terior ends of the two arcus tendinei fasciae pelvis and forms a small fossa. (Cf. Fig. 279.) Isolate the x)i‘ominent bands bound- ing this fossa laterally, the lateral puboprostatic ligaments {Ligg. puboprostatica later alia) (0. T. lateral true ligaments of the bladder); in the female they are the Ligg. puhovesicalia lat- eralia (0. T. vesical layer of fascia endo|delvina). Dissect in the

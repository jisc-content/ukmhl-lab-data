ABDOMEN AND PELVIS 543 Bladder (Vesica urinaria). (Vide Fig. 292, and Spalteholz, Figs. 633, 640.) Compare the form of the bladder in the two sexes; also its position in the pelvis. Distend the bladder with air. How does the naturally distended bladder compare in form with the empty? Consult the pages on the male pelvis for the nomen- clature of the bladder and the directions for dissection. Pelvic Part of Ureter (Pars pelvina ureteris). (Vide Fig. 291, and Spalteholz, Fig. 665.) Isolate the ureter as it passes into the pelvis at the bifurca- tion of the common iliac arteries. Compare the lengths of the pelvic divisions in the male and female. Trace the ureter for- ward to the base of the broad ligament. Establish its relations to the uterine artery. What surgical significance has this ana- tomical relation? Fig. 291. Plexus uterovaginalis Diagram showing the relations of the ureter to the cervix [uteri] and adjacent vessels. The line LL passes a little below the vaginal isthmus of the uterus. The longitudinal striations indicate the vaginal wall, and the dotted line shows the contour of the cervix uteri. The vertical line, 25 mm., indicates the length of the cervix uteri. (From Poirier et Charpy, Trait6 dâ€™Anat. hum., Paris, 1901, t. v. p. 457, Fig. 320.) Trace the ureter forward to the bladder and establish its relation to the anterior vaginal wall. At what angle does the ureter enter the bladder? Uterus (Uterus) (O. T. Womb). (Vide Spalteholz, Figs. 662, 664, 665, 667.) Use models and special preparations for this study. Estab- lish the position and relations of the uterus. How does the infantile compare with the adult organ? (a) Body of uterus {corpus uteri). (aa) Fundus of uterus {fundus uteri). {ab) Lateral margin {margo lateralis).

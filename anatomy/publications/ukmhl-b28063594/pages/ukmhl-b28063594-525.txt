ABDOMEN AND PELVIS 521 To expose the superior fascia of the pelvic diaphragm {fascia diaphragmatis pelvis superior), remove the peritoneum from the sides of the pelvic wall and bladder by blunt dissection. Scrape away carefully the extraperitoneal fatty tissue with the handle of the scalpel. The bladder must be forcibly separated from the pubic bones and the intervening fatty tissue removed, to secure adequate exposure of the fascia anteriorly. After the fascia has been exposed establish its continuity Fig. 275. To show the cut surfaces of the os coxae after removal of the piece cut out to expose the external surface of the pelvic fascia. with the fascia transversal is and the fascia iliaca at the terminal line {linea terminalis). Trace it downward and demonstrate that it covers the ilium and the upper part of the fascia obtura- toria. It then becomes thickened and passes downward and medialward upon the upper surface of the pelvic diaphragm as far as the tendinous arch of the pelvic fascia {arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis) ; the tendinous arch passes in a curve, convexity directed downward and lateralward, from the symphysis ossium

85 DISSECTION OF THE UPPEII EXTREMITY midway between its origin and its insertion and the caput longum of the M. biceps four centimetres below its origin. Reflect these muscles. Carefully dissect from the capsule of the joint the Mm. supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. Eig. 26. Cavity of the articnlatio acromioclavicularis Clean the surfaces of the ligaments carefully. Study the fol- lowing : (a) Articular capsule {capsula articularis). Note its cone shape, the summit attached to the lab rum glenoi- dale, its base to the anatomical neck of the humerus. The attach- ment goes beyond the anatomical neck behind and below. Observe the variations in the thickness of the capsule in different parts. (h) Coracohumeral ligament {ligamentum coracohumerale) (0. T. acces- sory ligament). How is it attached medialward and lateralward ? Note that it corresponds to the inteiwal between the tendons of the M. supra- spinatus and M. subscapularis, and so strengthens the capsule in a region otherwise feebly protected. (c) Glenohumeral ligaments. (Cf. Fig. 27.) Dissect off the posterior part of the capsula articularis, pull the bones well apart, look into the joint from behind,

28 433 ABDOMEN AND PELVIS Mark out on the abdomen, perineum, and small of the back the various regions. Make three drawings of these regions, labelling them accurately, one of the anterior surface, one of the posterior surface, and one of the perineum when the body is in the lithotomy position. (Vide Figs. 1, 2, 219, and 220.) Inspect the surface of the abdomen. Note the lower margin of the thorax, counting the ribs {costae) and marking each with its number. Locate the heart fossa {scrohiculus cordis) and the navel {umbilicus). What is its position with reference to {a) the lumbar vertebrae, {h) the thorax and pubis? How does its position differ in the two sexes ? Observe the furrow in the median line {linea mediana ante- rior) and note the difference in this furrow above and below the umbilicus. Examine the pubic eminence {mons pubis) covered with hair {pubes). Note the prominences due to the Mm. recti abdominis and the furrows bounding these lateralward. Exam- ine the direction of the hair streams {flumina pilorum). Note the distribution of pigment in the skin; in female subjects look for white, depressed streaks in the skin over the side and front of the abdomen {striae albicantes). In the depression of the groin {inguen) observe the linear elevation due to PouparFs ligament {ligamentum inguinale [Pouparti]). Follow it out to the spina iliaca anterior superior. On the lateral surface of the abdomen define the limits of the loin {latus). On the posterior surface of the abdomen examine the small of the back {lumbus). Follow the furrow in the middle line {linea mediana posterior) downward to the cleft between the buttocks {crena ani). Note the hair streams {flumina pilo- rum) here and vortices pilorum. Observe the prominence on each side due to the M. sacrospinalis. Note that the surface of the lumbus passes upward over the twelfth rib into the back and lateralward to the loin {latus) without any perceptible delimita- tion ; below it is separated from the surface of the hip {coxa ) by the iliac crest. Observe the foveola coccygea. After thorough inspection, palpate the anterior and posterior surfaces. Feel the cartilage of the xiphoid process {processus

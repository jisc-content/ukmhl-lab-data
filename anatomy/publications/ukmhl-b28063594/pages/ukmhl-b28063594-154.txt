H 150 LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY (6) Highest artery of knee (A. genu swprema) (0. T. anastomotica iiiagiia). {ba) Saphenous ranms {ramus saphenus). {bb) Muscular ramus {ramus muscularis). {be) Articular rami {rami articulares). Review now the femoral vein throughout its whole course, examining its various tributaries. How does its relative position as regards the femoral artery change as it proceeds distalward towards the hiatus tendineus adductoriusf With scissors slit the vein open along its whole length and look for valves. The femoral vein is often thrombosed in the course of typhoid fever, or in pelvic infections, especially during the puerperal period (phlegmasia alba dolens). Femoral Nerve and Muscles of Front of Thigh. (Fig. 6i.) Clean the muscles of the front of the thigh carefully and follow the nerve branch to each. Study thoroughly the femoral nerve (N. femoralis) (0. T. anterior crural) and all its branches, cutaneous and muscular. What are these and what do they supply ! Does the femoral nerve innervate joints! Study the form, position, origin, insertion, action, and inner- vation of each of the following muscles: (a) Tensor muscle of fascia lata (M. tensor fasciae latae) (0. T. tensor vaginae femoris). Study exact relation to— {aa) Iliotibial band {tractus iliotibiaUs [Maissiati]). Cut through the iliotibial band below the tensor muscle, deflect it forcibly lateralward, and displace the M. vastus lateralis mediahvard so as to expose the lateral intermuscu- lar septum {septum intermusculare [/ewor/s] laterale). How is it attached at its two edges! What important structures perforate it! Examine also the medial intermuscular septum {septum intermusculare [/‘cwom] mediale). Which is the stronger, the medial or the lateral septum! {h) Quadriceps (“four-headed’’) muscle of thigh {M. quadriceps femo- ris ). {ba) Rectus (“straight”) muscle of thigh {M. rectus femoris). {baa) Bursa M. recti femoris. {bh) Vastus lateralis muscle (“lateral great muscle”) {M. vastus lateralis) (0. T. vastus externus). {be) Vastus medialis muscle (“medial great muscle”) (3/. vastus medialis) (0. T. vastus interims). {bd) Vastus intermedins muscle (“intermediate great muscle”) {M. vasiiis intermedins) (0. T. crureus). Cut through the M. rectus femoris at its middle and reflect distal end forcilily. Find the gToove between the M.

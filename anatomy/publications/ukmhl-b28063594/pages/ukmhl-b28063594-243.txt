DISSECTION OF THE HEAD- AND NECK 239 Examine the membrane {arachnoidea spinalis) which bounds the cavmn subdurale internally. Note that this is what many anatomists call the visceral layer’’ of the arachnoid; below, at the summit of the conus terminalis (second sacral), it is re- flected upon the dura mater to form the parietal layer” of the arachnoid; the arachnoid cavity” of various writers is sit- Fig. 98. Filum terminale Arachnoidea spinalis subdurale Dura mater spinalis Disposition of the arachnoidea spinalis at the inferior extremity of the medulla spinalis. The sections are schematic (longitudinal and transverse). The pia mater is in red. The transverse section pa.sses through the cauda equina, (From Poirier et Charpy, Trait6 d’Anat. hum., Paris, 1899, t. iii., 1, p. 118, Fig. 83.) uated between the parietal layer and the visceral layer, being the cavum subdurale of the present nomenclature. It is a serous cavity like the pleura. Can you separate the ‘‘ parietal layer” from the dura? Do you see any blood-vessels in the visceral layer”? Are there any calcified plates in the latter?

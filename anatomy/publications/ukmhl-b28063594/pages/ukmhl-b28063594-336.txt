LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY 332 End-brain (Telencephalon). Note that it consists of the optic part of the hypothalamus (pars optica hypothalami) and the hemisphere (hemisphaer- iiim). Hemisphere (Hemisphaerium). This includes the brain-mantle (pallium), the olfactory brain (rhinencephalon), and the striate body (corpus striatum). The fissura longitudinal is cerebri was examined before the hemi- spheres were separated. Locate now the transverse fissure of the cerebrum (fissura transversa cerebri). Fig. 149. The left cerebral hemisphere. Lateral aspect. (After Toldt, Anat. Atlas, 'NVien, 1903, 3 Aufl., p. 777, Fig. 1194.) Brain-mantle (Pallium). Note its subdivision by fissures (fissurae cerebri) and grooves (sulci cerebri) into convolutions (gyri cerebri). What is the difference arbitrarily made between a “ fissure” and a “ sul- cus”? Besides the main gyri, there are others in the depth (gyri profundi) and small gyri connecting adjacent gyri, the so-called gyri transitivi (0. T. annectent gyri). On the basis cerebri note the petrosal impression (impressio petrosa) due to the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The student should begin his study of the topography of the pallium with a careful examination of the lateral fissure of the

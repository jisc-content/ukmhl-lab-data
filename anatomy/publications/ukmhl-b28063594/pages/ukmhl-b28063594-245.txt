DISSECTION OE THE HEAD AND NECK 241 closely does this membrane invest the cordf Note its extreme vascularity. What is meant by the term “ lepto- meninx ’ ’ f Study the lig amentum denticu- lafum. Where is the medial border of the ligament inserted! On the lat- eral border note the teeth and the free arcades intermediate between the teeth. Into what are the summits of the teeth inserted! What is the rela- tion of the ligamentum denticulatum to the anterior and posterior roots! The number of teeth varies from eigh- teen to twenty-three. How many are there in your subject! What is the function of the ligament! Study the relations of the spinal nerve roots to the pia, the arachnoid, and the dura. (Of. Poirier et Charpy, iii., Fig. 103.) The Spinal Nerves (Nervi spinales). (Figs. 99 and loo.) Count these on each side. Distin- guish the cervical nerves {Nn. cervi- cales, 7.-F777.), the thoracic nerves {Nn. thoracales, L-XIL), the lumbar nerves {Nn. lumhales, 7.-F.), the sacral Spinal cord in connection above with the medulla oblongata and pons. V, nervus trigeminus; XII, nervus hypoglossus; C\, first cervical nerve ; C‘2-8, second to eighth cervical nerve ; Tl-12, first to twelfth thoracic nerve; L 1-5, first to fifth lumbar nerve; .Sl-5, first to fifth sacral nerve; G, nervus coccygeus; X, X, filum terminale of the spinal cord. From the root marked L\ to x, cauda equina; Er, plexus brachialis; Cr, nervus femoralis; Sc, nervus ischiadicus; 0, nervus obtura- torius; the enlargements opposite L 3, 4, and 5 represent the spinal ganglia on the dorsal roots. On the left side of the figure the sympathetic trunk is shown, a to ss are ganglia; a, ganglion cervicale superius; b and c, ganglion ccrvicale medium et inferius; d, first thoracic ganglion; d", last thoracic ganglion ; I, first lumbar ganglion ; ss, first sacral ganglion.

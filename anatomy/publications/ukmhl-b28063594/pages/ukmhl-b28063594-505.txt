Fig. 265. Curvatura ventriculi major ,-Extremitas superior .Facies gastrica Ligamentum gastrolienale - Extremitas inferior Hilus lienis Lien accessorius (Var.) The spleen in conjunction with the ligamentum gastrolienale. Seen from in front. (After Toldt, Anat. xVtlas, Wien, 1900, 2 Aufl., p. 434, Fig. 723.) Spleen (Lien). (Vide Figs. 261, 263, 265, and Spalteholz, Fig. 587.) Remove the spleen from your subject. It has already been examined in position in the cadaver. Examine models to deter- mine the exact position of the organ in cadavers with the organs hardened in situ and its relation to vertebrae, ribs, and neighbor- ing viscera. Note the following: Surfaces. (a) Diaphragmatic surface {facies diaphragmatica). (b) Renal surface {facies renalis). (c) Gastric surface {facies gastrica). Extremities. (a) Superior extremity {extremitas superior). {b) Inferior extremity {extremitas inferiur).

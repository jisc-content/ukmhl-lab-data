ABDOMEN AND PELVIS 547 (a) Abdominal month of uterine tube {ostium ahdominale tubae uter- inae). This commnnicates with the peritoneal cavity. (h) Infnndihnlnm of uterine tube {infundibulum tubae uterinae). (c) Fimbriae of tube {fimbriae tubae). {ca) Ovarian fimbria {fimbria ovarica). {d) Ampulla of uterine tube {ampulla tubae uterinae). {e) Isthmus of uterine tube {isthmus tubae uterinae). Fig. 294. Scheme of the development of the internal female genital organs, showing their initial situation and their situation again after apparent descent. Organs which persist are in unbroken outline (except the ovary in the lower position), those that atrophy are in dotted outline (Hertwig). (After Poirier et Charpy, Traite dâ€™Anat. hum., Paris, 1901, 2 ed., t. v. p. 399, Fig 290.) Round Ligament of Uterus (Ligamentum teres uteri). (Vide Spalte- holz, Figs. 665, 667, 675.) Dissect out the round ligament forward to the annulus in- guinalis abdoininalis. Do any lymphatics accompany the round ligament? If so, with what lymph-nodes do they communicate? From what is the round ligament developed, and what is its homologue in the male? What is its function? What is the vaginal process of the peritoneum {processus vaginalis peri- tonaei) (0. T. canal of Nuck) ? Diaphragm of the Pelvis (Diaphragma pelvis). (Vide Spalteholz, Figs. 670, 671.) Dissect out the following muscles and determine their rela- tions to the bladder, vagina, uterus, and rectum. Compare these muscles with those in the male, noting carefully any differences.

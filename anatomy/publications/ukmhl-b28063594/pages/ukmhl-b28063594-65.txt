61 DISSECTION OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY cleaned, the loose areolar tissue and fat in which they are em- bedded being gradually removed. Secure first the subscapular artery and the thoracodorsal nerve along the lower border of the M. subscapularis, then the lateral thoracic artery (lower border of M. pectoralis minor), next the long thoracic nerve (lying on M. serratus magnus). The various lymph-glands are Fig. 14.

Subject fixed in formalin chromic acid. The fat over the V. and A. circumflex posterior and the N. axillaris has been removed to show the course of these structures. The N. radialis is seen medial to the N. axillaris. The N. ulnaris lies anterior to the N. radialis. The two heads of the median have ju.st united and the N. musculocutaneus is separating off.

The following structures are to be isolated and studied, some of them being best seen after the dissection of the M. pectoralis minor and the fascia coracoclavicularis. Lymphatic Glands. (Cf. Figs. 15, 86, and 93.) (a) Axillaiy lymph-glands {lymphoglandulae axillares). (b) Pectoral lymph-glands {lymphoglandulae pectorales).

LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY 498 faces and trace these upon the stomach. Some filaments will have been destroyed in the earlier dissections. In connection with the abdominal part of the vagus nerve (N. vagus) study— {a) Gastric branches {rami gastrici). (b) Anterior gastric plexus {plexus gastricus anterior). (c) Posterior gastric plexus {plexus gastricus posterior). {d) Hepatic branches {rami hepatici). {e) Coeliac branches {rami coeliaci). {ea) Splenic branches {rami lienales). {eb) Renal branches {rami renales). Stomach (Ventriculus). (Vide Spalteholz, Figs. 557-560.) Pass two ligatures about the abdominal portion of the oesophagus, cut between, and remove the stomach. Use models to determine its exact form, position, relations, etc. What is the direction of the axis of this organ! Note that the upper two- thirds is vertical, while the lower one-third passes to the right, upward and slightly backward. These two parts make an angle with each other which varies between 60° and 70°. For a full discussion concerning the exact position of these two parts, con- sult the systematic text-books. Examine— (a) Anterior wall {paries anterior). {b) Posterior wall {paries posterior). (c) Greater curvature of stomach {curvatura ventriculi major). {d) Lesser curvature of stomach {curvatura ventriculi minor). {e) Cardia {cardia). (/) Fundus of stomach {fundus ventriculi). {g) Body of stomach {corpus ventriculi). {h) Pylorus {pylorus). {i) Cardiac part {pars cardiaca). {j) Pyloric part {pars pylorica). {k) Cardiac antrum {antrum cardiacum). This is only occasionally present. (Z) Pyloric antrum {antrum pyloricum). How much of the stomach is to the left of the median plane! How much to the right! What is the relation of the cardia to the sternal extremity of the seventh costal cartilage on the left side! What is the relation of the pylorus to the median plane and to the umbilicus! Draw a line uniting the medial extremities of the ninth costal cartilages. What is the position of the pylorus in relation to this line! What is the position of the greater curvature! Does it vary! The relation of the stomach to each

240 LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY prolongation of the arachnoid over the nerve roots and over the summits of the teeth of the ligamentum denticulatum. Lift the visceral layer of the arachnoid, cut through it with fine scissors, insert grooved director, and cut it open longitudi- nally a little to one side of median line. Examine the space {cavum subarachnoideale) beneath the visceral layer of the arachnoid and the pia mater. Note the expanse of the space especially in the region of the cauda equina, which it contains. Fig. 99. A, spinal cord seen from the ventral surface. On the right side the ventral fila radicularia have been cut through. B, spinal cord seen from the lateral surface.—1, fissura mediana anterior; 2, sulcus medianus posterior; 3, sulcus lateralis ventralis, whence the ventral fila radicularia emerge; 4, sulci laterales dorsales through which the dorsal root fibres enter the spinal cord ; 5, radix ventralis going past spinal ganglion cut through on the right side in Fig. A; 6, radix dorsalis emerging from the ganglion spinale (6'); 7, N. spinalis immediately after its formation through the union of the radix ventralis and dorsalis dividing into 7, a ram as ventralis, and 7', a ramus dorsalis. The ramus com- municans and the ramus meningeus are not shown in this figure. (After Allen Thompson, from A. Rauber, Lehrbuch der Anatomie des Menschen, V. Aufl., Leipz., 1898, Bd. ii. S. 283, Fig. 248.) Where would the cerebrospinal fluid accumulate in greatest amount? Note precise spot where cavum subarachnoideale is tapped in Quincke’s lumbar puncture. There is no coimnunica- tion between the cavum subdurale and the cavum arachnoideale. Notice the areolar tissue everywhere present between the arach- noid and the pia. Make out the septum subarachnoideale pos- terius. Examine the spinal pia mater {pia mater spinalis). How

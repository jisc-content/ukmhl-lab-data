53 DISSECTION OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY {b) From the processus xiplioideus lateralward to the back. (c) From the upper end of the first incision lateralward along the clavicle to the tip of the acromion. (d) From the processus xiplioideus obliquely upward and lateralward along the plica axillaris anterior as far as the brachium. With a sharp knife dissect up the two triangular flaps marked out by the incisions mentioned. Keep the knife close to the white coriuin so that none of the fat of the superficial fascia is re- moved with the skin. Compare the amount of fat in the superficial fascia in your subject with that in neighboring subjects. Find the fibres of the platysma streaming down into it over the clavicle. Note that the mammary gland is situated in the superficial fascia. Cut boldly through the superficial fascia down to the deep fascia in the middle line in front, and then with the blunt probe dissect up the superficial fascia, passing gradually lateralward. Find the cutaneous blood-vessels and nerves passing into the super- ficial fascia from the depth. When the trunks of these are found, follow each carefully out as far as possible into the super- ficial fascia, cleaning it care- fully. Avoid injury to the superficial nerves which pass down over the clavicle. Keep your atlases open before you as a guide to the location of the various structures. As soon as a nerve or blood-vessel is found, identify it, getting the name from the atlas. Find a description of it in your systematic text-book of anatomy (using the index of the latter) and com- pare the actual findings in your subject with the text-book de- scription. Note especially any differences between your object- ive findings and the printed descriptions. Skin incisions on the anterior surfaces of the body

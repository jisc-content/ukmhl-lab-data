LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY 198 Dura Mater of Brain (Dura mater encephali). (Vide Figs. 83, 84.) Wipe the surface clean with a moist sponge. Study— («) Middle meningeal artery (A. meningea media). {b) Araclmoideal granulations (granulationes arachnoideales [Pacchi- oni]) (0. T. Pacchionian gTanulations). Place the head nearly upright and support it by blocks. Make two sagittal incisions through the dura mater, one on each side of the superior sagittal sinus, along its whole length. Prom Fig. 83. .

The subdural space {cavum suhdurale) has now been opened up. Compare the inner surface of the dura mater with the outer. The arachnoid of the brain {arachnoidea encephali) is non- vascular and transparent. Through it the vessels of the pia mater of the brain {pia mater encephali) are visible. Superior Sagittal Sinus The veins on the surface of the brain can be seen running towards the superior sagittal sinus {sinus sagittalis superior) (0. T. superior longitudinal sinus). This sinus should be opened throughout its whole length with a sharp knife or scissors. Observe in it the network-like bands (0. T. chordae Willisi). Cut through the superior veins of the cerebrum which empty

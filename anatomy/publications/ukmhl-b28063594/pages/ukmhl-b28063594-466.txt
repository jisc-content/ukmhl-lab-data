This organ, already studied to a certain extent, should now be further examined. Dissect out the suspensory ligament {Lig. suspensorium penis) and the dorsal vessels and nerves. PERITONEUM AND VISCERA. Developmental Relations. (Cf. Figs. 241-244.) Before beginning the study of the peritoneum, the development of the coelomic cavities and the transitional stages in the mesenterium commune should be carefully studied. Frequent reference should be made to Cun- ningham, pp. 1054-1058; Poirier et Charpy, pp. 870-898. What are the foregut, midgut, hindgut, and vitelline duct, and what relation does this latter bear to the diverticulum occasionally found upon the ileum? In what percentage of the cases is this diverticulum present, and how far distant is it from the iliocaecal junction?

DISSECTION OF THE THORAX 403 THORACIC CAVITY (CAVUM THORACIS). It is well to precede the dissection of this region by the study of a frozen or formalin section ^ through the thorax, a little below its middle, in order that the general relations of the thoracic viscera to one another may be understood.^ (Vide Fig. 200.)

(After Toldt, Anat. Atlas, Wien, 1900, 2 Aufi., p. 455, Fig. 773.) Pleura. The student has to study— (a) Pulmonary pleura (pleura pulmonalis). (b) Parietal pleura (pleura parietalis). Between (a) and (h) is the cavity of the pleura (cavum pleurae). ^ See foot-note on making sections, p. 474. ^ The student is strongly advised to study a series of cross-sections through the trunk of a human being; in this work he will find the plates and descrip- tions by Dr. Potter, of St. Louis, of great help; these are published under the title Topographical Anatomy of the Viscera of the Thorax and Abdomen,” in the “ University Studies of the University of Missouri, 1904.”

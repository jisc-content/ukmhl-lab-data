391 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK {h) Fixing- muscle of the base of the stapes {M. fixator baseos sta- pedis). Muscles of Auditory Bones. These muscles {musculi ossiciilorum aucUtus) are two in number: (a) Tensor muscle of tympanum {M. tensor tympani). {b) Stapedius muscle {M. stapedius). Study form, position, origin, insertion, action, and innerva- tion of each. Fig. 193.

Only that part of the cavum tympani supporting the membrana tympani is represented. (From Gegenbaur, Lehrb. der Anat. des Mensch., Leipzig, 1899, 7 Aufl., Bd. ii. p. 615, Fig. 728.) The student should next review certain structures previously studied,—viz, the chorda tympani (see p. 264 and Figs. Ill and 115), the plexus tympanicus and the N. tympanicus (see p. 271), and the tuba auditiva [Eustachii] (see pp. 293 and 296). The study of the internal ear is very difficult. Much can be learned by fastening a temporal bone in a vice and chiselling cautiously until the osseous labyrinth is exposed. The temporal bone of a new-born babe or of a younger foetus will be found very helpful for study. The labyrinth of a guinea-pig and an embryo pig will also well repay study. In the museum, the ex- quisite preparations of isolated labyrinths. Wood’s metal corro- sions, and models are available for study. The student should use these and should study his atlases and good descriptive texts in connection with them. Osseous Labyrinth (Labyrinthus osseus). Here the student should study successively the vestibule (ves- tibulum), the snail-like body {cochlea), and the internal acoustic meatus {meatus acusticus internus).

178 LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY (a) Short flexor muscle of the toes {M. flexor digitorum brevis). Exam- ine its ligamentous sheath {ligamentum vaginale), annular ligament {ligamentum annulare), and the cruciate ligament {ligamentum cruciatum), After having made a careful study of this ligamentous sheath, incise it in the medial line and reflect each way, preserving care- fully the vessels and nerves. Note the synovial sheath {vaginae tendinum digitales pedis) surrounding the flexor tendons. (Vide Spalteholz, Fig. 407.) What relations exist between the tendons of the long and of the short flexors of the toes? Compare these relations with those found in the hand. {h) Abductor muscle of great toe {M. abductor hallucis). (c) Abductor muscle of little toe {M. abductor minimi digiti). Divide these muscles at their origin and reflect them forward. Exercise giâ€™eat care and avoid injury to vessels and nerves immediately beneath. Plantar Arteries. (Vide Spalteholz, Fig. 481.) Determine the relations of these different arteries. What is the linear guide for each artery? All the branches are mentioned here, although many will not be seen at this stage of the dis- section. (a) Medial plantar artery {A. plantaris medialis) (0. T. internal plan- tar). (aa) Superficial branch {ramus superficialis). {ab) Deep branch {ramus profundus). {b) Lateral plantar artery {A. plantaris lateralis) (0. T. external plan- tar). {ba) Plantar arch {arcus plantaris). {baa) Plantar metatarsal arteries {Aa. metatarseae plan- tares ). {bab) Perforating branches {rami perforantes). {bac) Digital plantar arteries {Aa. digitales plantares). With what arteries do the above anastomose? Dissect out the veins accompanying the arteries and trace them into larger stems. Plantar Nerves. (Vide Spalteholz, Figs. 824 and 825.) Determine what muscle is supplied by each nerve, also the exact cutaneous supply. What is muscle sense? (a) Medial plantar nerve {N. plantaris medialis) (0. T. internal plantar). {aa) Common digital plantar nerves {Nn. digitales plantares com- munes). {ab) Proper digital plantar nerves {Nn. digitales plantares pro- prii). {b) Lateral plantar nerve {N. plantaris lateralis) (0. T. external plan- tar). {ba) Superficial branch {ramus superficialis). Common digital plantar nerves {Nn. digitales plantares communes).

542 LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY Ueteriiiiiie the relation of this fascia to the uterine and vaginal walls. (e) Middle pubovesical ligament {Lig. pubovesicale medium). {f) Lateral pubovesical ligaments {Ligg. pubovesicalia lateralia). (g) Inferior fascia of pelvic diaphragm {fascia diajdiragmatis pelvis inferior). The latter fascia has already been studied in the dissection of the fossa ischiorectalis. It should now be reviewed and its relation to the fascia obturatoria and the arcus tendineus M. levatoris ani established. Pelvic Vessels and Nerves. Dissect out the arteries and veins of the pelvis. Consult the pages on the male pelvis, noting the differences. Study the following: Arteries. (a) Uterine artery {arteria uterina). (Vide Spalteholz, Fig. 471.) (aa) Vaginal artery {A. vaginalis). {ah) Tubal branch {A. tubarius). {ac) Branch to ovary {ramus ovarii). Pay especial attention to the relation between the uterine artery and the ureter. At what distance from the cervix uteri does the artery cross the ureter? {b) Ovarian artery {A. ovarica). Through what ligament does the ovarian artery pass to reach the ovary? What is its relation to the ligamentum suspensorium ovarii ? Veins. {a) Uterovaginal plexus {plexus uterovaginalis). (Vide Spalteholz, Fig. 502.) Lymphatics. Use special preparations for this study. (Consult Poirier et Charpy, i. 5, Figs. 338, 339.) Determine into what lymph-nodes the lymphatics of the cervix and the body of the uterus empty. Pelvic Spinal Nerves. Consult the directions in regard to the male pelvis for the dissection of these nerves. Rectum (Intestinum rectum). (Vide Spalteholz, Figs. 575, 576, 591, 6S5Â» 656, 665.) The female rectum does not differ materially in structure from tlaailiof the male. Its relations should be carefully studied. Establi'sihjiiits relations to the posterior vaginal wall and the perinealllliiiody. Use models and cross-sections as supplementary to the cadaver for this purpose.

492 LABORATORY MANUAL OR HUMAN ANATOMY sect out carefully the sympathetic nerves {plexus coeliacus) ac- companying this artery and its branches. Preserve these as far as possible. Examine the origins of the following branches: (а) Left gastric artery {A. gastrica sinistra). {aa) Oesophageal branches [rami oesophagi). (б) Hepatic arteiy {A. hepatica). The branches of this artery have already been traced to their destinations. (c) Lienal or splenic artery (A. lienalis). This artery can be seen to the best advantage if the stomach is turned upward towards the thorax. Note carefully its relations to the pancreas and the pancreaticolienal and lienorenal ligaments. (ca) Pancreatic branches {rami pancreatici). {cb) Left gastro-epiploic artery (A. gastro-epiploica sinistra). (cc) Short gastric arteries (Aa. gastricae breves). {cd) Splenic branches {rami lienales). Duodenum. (Vide Figs. 259, 261, 262, and Spalteholz, Fig. 563.) Study this part of the small intestine in your cadaver and compare it with the His models. Divisions and angles. (a) Superior part {pars superior), or first portion. {b) Descending part {pars descendens), or second portion. (c) Inferior part {pars inferior). {ca) Horizontal part {pars horizontalis [inferior']), or third part. {cb) Ascending part {pars ascendens), or fourth part. {d) Superior duodenal flexure {flexura duodeni superior). {e) Inferior duodenal flexure {flexura duodeni inferior). (/) Duodenojejunal flexure {flexura duodenojejunalis). Three types of duodena are described. (1) The annular type is met with in the second half of foetal life (Toldt). It is found almost always in the infant and is known as the infan- tile type of Jonnesco. Occasionally it persists to adult life. (2) The U-shaped. The pars inferior is very long. (3) The V-shaped. The pars descendens passes down almost vertically. The ascending portion passes upward and to the left, making an angle of 25° to 40° with the descending part. The pars horizon- talis is lacking. In what subdivisions of the abdomen is the duodenum sit- uated? What is its relation to the upper and lower abdominal compartments and to the right and left colon pockets (separated by the radix mesenterii) ? How is it related to the liver, the pancreas, the ductus chole- dochus, the vertebrae, the right and left kidneys, the superior mesenteric artery and vein, the right spermatic artery, etc.?

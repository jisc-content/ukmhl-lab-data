423 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX mentum arteriosmn. The arcus aortae should now be drawn aside and the trachea and Nn. cardiaci exposed. Find the fol- lowing nerves, which help to form the deep cardiac plexus : (a) From the sympathetic system: {aa) Middle cardiac nerve {N. cardiacus medius). {ah) Inferior cardiac nerve {N. cardiacus inferior). {b) From the N. vagus: {ba) Superior cardiac rami (0. T. cervical cardiac branches of pneinnogastrie). Is an isolated “ N. depressor’’ present? (bb) Inferior cardiac rami from the N. recnrrens {rami cardiaci inferiores nervi recurrentis) (0. T. cardiac branches of re- current laryngeal). Notice the subdivision of the plexus cardiacus into a right and a left portion. How is the plexus cardiacus related to the anterior and poste- rior coronary plexuses? Removal of Heart. Divide the A. pulmonalis and the Vv. pulmonales and remove the heart from the body. Continue the incision in the anterior wall of the left ventricle through the ascending aorta, but make sure that it passes between two of the semilunar valves. Valves of Aorta. The semilunar valves of the aorta (valvulae semilunares aortae) are now to be studied. (a) Posterior semilunar valve {valvula semilunaris posterior). {b) Right semilunar valve {valvula semilunaris dextra). (c) Left semilunar valve {valvula semilunaris sinistra). Examine the nodules {noduli valvularum semilunarium [Arantii']) (0. T. corpora Arantii) and sails’’ or lunulae” {lunulae valvularum semilunarium) of the valves. Examine the sinus aortae [Valsalvae'] from the inside and note exact origin, on the inside, of the Aa. coronaria. Myocardium. Its relations to the epicardium and endocardium should be reviewed. The student should study a sheep’s heart or a calf’s heart that has been macerated in fifty per cent. HCl or in equal parts of glycerin, alcohol, and nitric acid. Or a sheep’s heart filled with a paste of flour and water may be boiled for fifteen

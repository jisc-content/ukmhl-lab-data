35 INTRODUCTION surface of the earth, is spoken of as being horizontal {horizon- talis); if it merely run across the body or one of its parts at right angles to the axis of the body, it is said to be transversal (transversalis). The term transverse (transversus) means across the long axis of the organ concerned. Lines or planes which run parallel to the median plane are called sagittal {sagit- talis); those parallel to the surface of the forehead, frontal {frontalis), The terms inner (internus) and outer {extemus) have been very loosely used in English text-books, often being employed in the sense of medial and lateral, as well as indicating the direc- tion in relation to the interior of organs, cavities of the body, or regions of the body; in the nomenclature used in this book the terms are restricted exclusively to the latter meaning. In de- scribing the dimensions of organs length or longitudinal direc- tion {longitiidinalis), breadth or transverse direction {trans- versus), and thickness are the terms employed to indicate the largest, middle, and smallest dimensions. Particular attention is called to the distinction between transversus and transversalis, the latter being reserved for a direction transverse to that of the median plane. The terms upper {superior) and lower {inferior) refer to the directions towards the vertex and towards the sole of the foot respectively, while the terms superficial {superficialis) and deep {profundus) indicate a position of less or greater separa- tion from the external surface of a part or organ. The term middle {medius) is used to indicate a position between superior and inferior or between externus and internus, but, since medius is easily confused by the beginning student with medialis, espe- cially when abbreviated, the term intermediate {intermedins) is employed to indicate a position midway between lateralis and medialis. In order to have terms, independent of the position of the body in space, for the directions towards the head-end or the tail-end of the body, the designations cranial {cranialis) and caudal {caudalis) have been introduced. In the head itself the continuance of the cranial direction can no longer very satis- factorily be designated as cranial; accordingly, this direction as far as the mouth or the nose is spoken of as rostral {rostralis). When the body is in the upright position, the direction towards the front is spoken of as anterior, that towards the back as posterior; the same directions in the body thought of as inde- pendent of its position in space, are spoken of as ventral {ven-

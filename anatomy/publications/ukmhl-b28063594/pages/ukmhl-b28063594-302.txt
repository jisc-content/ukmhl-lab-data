LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY 29S (aa) Mitldle meningeal nerve {N. meningeus [medius]) (0. T. recurrent). This has been studied already within the cranium. (ah) Zygomatic nerve {N. zygomaticus) (0. T. orbital or temporo- nialar). Already studied, with its two rami, in the orbit. (ac) Sphenopalatine nerves {Nn. sphenopalatini), going to the ganglion sphenopalatinum. {ad) Superior alveolar nerves {Nn. alveolares superiores). {ada) Posterior superior alveolar rami {rami alveolares superiores posteriores) (0. T. posterior superior dental). {ae) Infraorbital nerve {N. infraorhitalis). {aea [also adb]) Middle superior alveolar ramus {ramus alveolaris superior medius) (0. T. mid- dle superior dental). {aeh [also adc']) Anterior superior alveolar rami {rami alveolares superiores anteriores) (0. T. anterior supeiior dental). How is the superior dental plexus {plexus den- dentalis superior) formed? Find— (1) Superior dental rami {rami dentales supe- riores), (2) Superior gingival rami {rami gingivales superiores). The other terminal rami of the infraorbital nerve have been studied in the dissection of the face. {b) Infraorbital artery {A. infraorhitalis). Its origin has already been studied. Examine its course and— {ba) Anterior superior alveolar arteries {Aa. alveolares superiores anteriores) (0. T. anterior superior dental). SAGITTAL SECTION OF FOREPART OF HEAD NEAR MEDIAN PLANE. Remove the mandible, with the tongue and larynx, by making a cut backward from the angle of the mouth through the cheek, the raphe pterygomandibularis, and the lateral wall of the phar- ynx. Cut through also the vessels and nerves still connecting the pharynx with the skull. Wrap the larynx and tongue in moist cloth for subsequent dissection. Make a sagittal saw-cut through the forepart of the skull just lateral from the septum nasi; if the septum is not vertical, but deviates somewhat to one side, make the section close to the concave side of the septum. Before sawing, cut through the cartilaginous part of the nose as far as the nasal bone with a

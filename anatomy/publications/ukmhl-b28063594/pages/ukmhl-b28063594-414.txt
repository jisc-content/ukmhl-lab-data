LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY 410 These will be found upon the arcus aortae between the N. vagus and the N. phrenicus. On dissection of the plexus, look for the cardiac ganglion of Wrisberg {ganglion cardiacum [Wrishergi]). Pericardium. Clean the external surface of the pericardium thoroughly; observe the ligaments which connect the pericardium to the ster- num {ligamenta sternopericardiaca). Examine the exact rela- tions of the pericardial sac to the diaphragm. Compare the general relations of the pericardium in the cadaver with the de- scription in a good text-book. Fig. 204. Schematic representation of the vascular system with the lymph- and chyle-vessels. (After Gegenbaur, Lehrb. der Anat. des Mensch., Leipzig, 1899, 7 Aufl., Bd. ii. p. 203, Fig. 498.) Open the pericardium by a crucial incision, making a vertical cut through it from the aorta to the diaphragm and a transverse cut in a line from the middle of the root of one lung to that of the other. Examineâ€” {a) Parietal pericardium {pericardium). (h) Visceral pericardium (epicardium). (c) Pericardial fluid (liquor pericardii). (d) Transverse sinus of pericardium (sinus transversus pericardii).

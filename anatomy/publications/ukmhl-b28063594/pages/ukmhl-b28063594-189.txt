185 After the ankle-joint has been studied, the tibia and fibula should be sawn through about five centimetres above their lower articular surfaces. Make a coronal section of the bones and study the ligament passing between their lower extremities. Establish the continuity of the synovial membrane of this joint with that of the ankle. Remove the crucial ligament of the leg and the transverse ligament of the foot, also the tendons passing over the ankle, and dissect out the joints of the foot. Articulations of the Foot (Articulationes Pedis). (Figs. Talocrural Articulation (Articulatio talocruralis) (Ankle-joint). In removing the soft parts in order to expose the joint, take great care not to injure the very delicate anterior part of the articular capsule. Fig. 78. Ramus perf. A. peron.

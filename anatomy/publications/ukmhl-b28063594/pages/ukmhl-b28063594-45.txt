41 i LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY UPPER EXTREMITY Make four drawings: (a) anterior view of the upper extrem- ity and the wall of the thorax, (b) posterior view of the same, (c) lateral view of the upper extremity, (d) medial view of the same. In the drawings show that the upper extremity {extremitas superior) is attached to the chest {thorax) in the clavicular and scapular regions. Note the prominence of the shoulder {axilla) ^ and the projection in its upper lateral part {acromion). Con- tinuous with the shoulder is the rounded upper arm {brachium) ; beneath it, between the brachium and the thorax, is the axillary fossa {fossa axillaris). Draw in its anterior and posterior bounding folds {plica axillaris anterior, plica axillaris poste- rior). Show how the forearm {antibrachium) joins the brachium at the elbow {cubitus); illustrate the change in size and shape of the antibrachium distalward. In the drawings of the brach- ium label the anterior surface {facies anterior), posterior sur- face {facies posterior), lateral surface {facies lateralis), and medial surface {facies medialis), also the sulcus bicipitalis lat- eralis and the sulcus bicipitalis medialis; in the forearm distin- guish the radial side or border {margo radialis), the ulnar side {margo ulnaris), the dorsal surface {facies dorsalis), and the volar surface {facies volaris). Note how the hand {manus) is attached to the antibrachium by the narrower wrist {carpus). Distinguish the proximal por- tion of the hand {metacarpus) from the subdivided distal por- tion, the fingers {digiti manus). Number the digits from the thumb side. The thumb is the first {digitus I., or pollex), the index-finger is the second {digitus II., or index), the middle ^ This is the proper usa^e of “ axilla.” In English texts it is often used as synonymous with “ fossa axillaris.”

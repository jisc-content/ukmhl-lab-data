437 ABDOMEN AND PELVIS two distinct layers. The fascia in this region is spoken of occa- sionally as the “ inferior perineal aponeurosis.” The inferior layer is continuous with all the neighboring superficial fascia, while the superior layer is dense and membranous. It is called Codes’ fascia; it gains smooth muscular fibres anteriorly to form the tunica dartos of the scrotum. ^ It is the continuation of Scarpa’s fascia of the abdomen into the perineum.

To demonstrate the attachments of this deep layer proceed as follows: Enter the knife in the median line at the base of the scrotum and carry it dorsalward and lateralward to the tuber ischiadicum on each side, exercising caution to avoid injury to important vessels and nerves just below this fascia. Carefully dissect back the central and the two lateral flaps, noting the attachment of the fascia. How is it related to the muscles immediately beneath? After studying this fascia fully, proceed to the study of the contents of the inferior perineal compartment.” Structures in “ Inferior Compartment” of Perineum between the Fas- cia Superflcialis Perinei and the Diaphragma Urogenitale. Muscles of the Perineum {Musculi perinei). (See Figs. 223 and 224.) These muscles are all attached to the organs of copulation and

ABDOMEN AND PELVIS 475 Determine the number of arcades formed by the superior mesenteric artery before the ultimate intestinal branches are given oft. Do these ultimate arteries anastomose with each other ? What are “ terminal arteries”'? The blood supply of the caecum and appendix is derived from the arteria ileocolica. It runs in the terminal x)art of the Fig. 248. A. pancreatico-. duodenalis inferior A. colica media A. colica dextra A. iliocolica — Processus vermiformis The superior mesenteric artery. The small intestine has been laid over to the left and the trans- verse colon turned upward. (After Gegenbaur, Lehrb. der Anat. des Mensch., Leipzig, 1899, 7 Aufl., Bd. ii. p. 277, Fig. 540.) mesentery and, as it approaches the ileocaecal junction, gives off four small twigs. Two of these supply the anterior and pos- terior surfaces of the caecum and are known respectively as the anterior and the posterior caecal artery. The anterior caecal artery gives rise to a fold in the peritoneum, which we already know as the plica mesentericocaecalis. The artery to the appen- dix is directed below and to the left, passing behind the terminal portion of the ileum to enter the mesenteriolum processus vermi-

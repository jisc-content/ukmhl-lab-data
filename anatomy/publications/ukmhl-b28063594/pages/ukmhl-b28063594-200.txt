(See Fig. 4, p. 47.) Muscles of the Scalp. Having isolated the blood-vessels and nerves, remove the rest of the superficial fascia bit by bit, exposing the muscles of the scalp; these and the aponeuroses are to be carefully cleaned. Take care not to injure the muscles which move the ear; expose each muscle by puttings it on the stretch. Write a description of the course and distribution of the nerves and blood-vessels ex- posed. Read the description given in your text-book of Sys- tematic Anatomv of each vessel and nerve. How do the struct- ures in your cadaver differ, if at all, from those described in the text-book? Note the extreme vascularity of the scalp. It is significant for the mobility and vitality of large fiaps of de- tached scalp. Study the exact origin and insertion and the innervation of each of the following muscles: (a) Epicranius muscle {M. epicranius) (0. T. occipitofrontalis). {aa) Frontal muscle {M. frontalis). {ah) Occipital muscle {M. occipitalis). {aha) Procerus (“prolonged”) muscle {M. procerus). Study the “ aponeurotic helmet” {galea aponeu- rotica) (0. T. epicranial aponeurosis). {h) Anterior auricular muscle {M. auricularis anterior) (0. T. attrahens auriculam). (c) Superior auricular muscle (ill. auricularis superior) (0. T. attolens auriculam). {d) Posterior auricidar muscle {M. auricularis posterior) (0. T. retrahens auriculam). Approximate the origin and insertion of each muscle so as to understand clearly its action. Dangerous Area of the Scalp. Make an incision from four to eight centimetres long in the galea aponeurotica in the middle line at the vertex; at right angles to this make a short transverse incision. Lift the corners of the flaps with forceps and note the loose areolar tissue, free

57 DISSECTION OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY Mammary Gland (Mamma). (Fig. lo.) Compare the gland in yoiu* subject with one from a subject of the opposite sex. If the breast is well developed, dissect the gland under water and make out— (a) Lobes of breast {lohi mammae). {aa) Lobules of breast {lobuli mammae). (b) Milk-diicts {ductus lactiferi). {ba) Milk-sinuses or ampullae {sinus lactiferi). Fig. 10.

(After Toldt, Anat. Atlas, Wien, 1900, 2 Aufl., p. 501, Fig. 860.) Review the blood-supply of the mamma. Study illustrations of the lymphatic channels leading from the breast to the pectoral lymph-glands {lymphoglandulae pectorales), the axillary lymph- glands {lymphoglandulae axillares), and the sternal lymph- glands {lymphoglandidae sterncdes). (Cf. Figs. 15, 86, and 93.) Note that where the breasts are very large the lymphatic chan- nels of one breast may communicate with those of the breast of the opposite side across the median line. Fascia Pectoralis or Deep Fascia. Note its relations above, below, medial ward, and lateralward, and the process from it to the fascia coracoclavicularis in the fossa infraclavicularis.

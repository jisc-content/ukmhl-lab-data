455 ABDOMEN AND PELVIS White Line (Linea alba). Wliat aponeuroses enter into the formation of the linea alba? Between what points does it extend? Note that it is broad in the upper two-thirds and rapidly diminishes in breadth in the lower third. Do you find foramina in the linea alba above the ’ innbilicns? Make a drawing of the dissection at this stage. Transversal Fascia (Fascia transversalis) (O. T. Transverse Fascia). On the right side cut through the M. transversus along the linea semilunaris and carefully reflect this muscle lateralward. Note under it two layers: externally, the fascia transversalis; internally, the peritoneum. These are separated by ‘‘ extra- peritoneal fatty tissue.” Trace the fascia inferiorly. Note its Fig. 234.

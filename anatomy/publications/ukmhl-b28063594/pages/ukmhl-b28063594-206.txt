202 LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY transverse sinus {sinus iransversus) (0. T. lateral sinus) and the superior petrosal sinus {sinus iietrosus superior). {b) Falx cerebelli. Note the relation of the occipital sinus to this membrane. (c) Diaphragina sellae. In connection with the dura mater at the base of the skull, the entrance and exit of the various cerebral nerves {Nn. cerebrates) (0. T. cranial nerves) should be carefully studied. Sinuses of the Dura Mater. (Vide Spalteholz, Figs. 483 and 484.) These venous sinuses {sinus durae matris) should now be systematically examined. Open each throughout its length with a knife having a sharp point. Study them in the following order: {a) Transverse sinus {sinus iransversus) (0. T. lateral sinus). Examine its course exactly and note its relations to the exterior of the skull. It is of very great practical impor- tance to the physician and surgeon, not infrequently becoming infected as a sequel of inflammation of the cel- lulae mastoideae. {aa) Confluence of the sinuses {confluens sinuum) (0. T. torcular Herophili). {ah) Internal auditory veins {Vv. auditivae internae). {b) Occipital sinus {sinus occipitalis). (c) Superior sagittal sinus {sinus sagittalis superior) (0. T. superior longitudinal sinus). {d) Inferior sagittal sinus {sinus sagittalis inferior) (0. T. inferior longitudinal sinus). (e) Straight sinus {sinus rectus). Note that it receives the V. cerebri magna [Galeni]. (/■) Inferior petrosal sinus {sinus petrosus inferior). How does it leave the skull? Into what does it empty? {g) Superior petrosal sinus {sinus petrosus superior). {h) Cavernous sinus {sinus cavernosus). Leave this unopened at present; it will be thoroughly studied subsequently. It receives the Vv. ophthalmicae superior et inferior and the sinus sphenoparietalis. (^) Anterior and posterior intercavernous sinuses {simis cavernosus ante- rior et posterior). These together with the two cavernous sinuses constitute the circular sinus {sinus circularis). {j) Sphenoparietal sinus {sinus sphenoparietalis) (0. T. sinus alae parvae). Note that it receives one V. meningea media, the Vv. cerebri infei’iores, the V. ophthalmomeningea, and frequently the V. diploica temporalis anterior. Certain veins should be studied at this juncture.

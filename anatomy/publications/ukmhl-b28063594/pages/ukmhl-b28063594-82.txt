78 LABORATORY MANUAL OF HUMAN ANATOMY Make an incision tlirongli the fascia bracliii along the middle line of the front of the upper arm and a circular incision proxi- mal to the lacertus fibrosus. liehect the fascia bracliii from the front of the arm in two flaps, medial and lateral, until the strong lateral and medial intermuscular septa are reached,— (a) Medial intei'museiilar septum {septum intermusculare {humeri'] ynediale) (0. T. internal interinnscnlar septum). {h) Lateral intermiiscular septum {septum intermusculare [humeri] lat- erale) (0. T. external intermuscular septum). Structures in Front of the Intermuscular Septa (Anterior Compart- ment of Arm). (See also Fig. 20.) Arte^'ies. Arrange the axillary arteiy and vein and the divided nerves of the brachial plexus in their proper order and tie them to a small stick, four centimetres long, placed transversely. Fasten this with a loop of cord to the processus coracoideus. Clean the brachial artery carefully throughout its whole extent and study its relations. (а) Brachial artery (A. brachialis). At what point does it begin? Where and how does it end? With what veins, nerves, and muscles does it enter into relation in the various parts of its course? Study the mode of origin, course, and distribution of the following branches: {aa) Deep artery of upper arm {A. profunda hrachii) (0. T. superior profunda). Note its relation to the radial nerve. Its branches and general distribution will be studied later. {ah) Superior ulnar collateral artery (A. collateralis ulnaris superior) (0. T. inferior profunda). Note its relation to the ulnar nerve. How does it arise? {ac) Inferior ulnar collateral arteiy (A. collateralis ulnaris in- ferior) (0. T. anastomotica magna). Note its anterior and posterior divisions. Veins. {a) Brachial veins {Vv. brachiales). {aa) Radial veins {Vv. radiates). {ab) Ulnar veins {Vv. ulnares). {ac) Basilic veins {Vv. basilicae), portions beneath fascia bracliii. (б) Cephalic vein (F. cephalica), portion in a duplicatiire of the fascia bracliii. Nerves. {a) Medial cutaneous nerve of upper arm {N. cutaneus brachii me- dialis) (0. T. lesser internal cutaneous, or nerve of Wrisberg). {b) Medial cutaneous nerve of forearm {N. cutaneus antibrachii me- dialis) (0. T. internal cutaneous). These nerves {a) and {b) have been studied before, with the exception of their parts subjacent to the fascia brachii.

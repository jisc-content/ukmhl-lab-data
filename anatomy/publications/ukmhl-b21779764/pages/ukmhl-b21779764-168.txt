60 most liable to them: such as the tibia, fibula, ulna, and clavicle ; the femur and humerus are but rarely aiFected. The flat bones of the head, particularly the os frontis, or os parietale, are also attacked with secondary syphilis. Of the irregular bones, the sternum is most subject to syphilitic attacks. The symptoms by which syphilitic diseases of the bones are known are as follow :â€”The patient experiences, in the evening, a sensation of pain in the bone, which is afterwards the seat of the node ; the pain does not immediately produce a swelling, but in the course of a few days a swelling appears in the evening, and disappears on the following morning. It is tender and painful in the even- ing, but these symptoms are scarcely perceptible in the morning. At this time the periosteum only is affected ; but soon after a deposit takes place between it and the surface of the bone; this deposit is in the first instance only a serous fluid, but a cartilaginous substance is soon se- creted, which is gradually converted into bone, forming a node. The bone may become en- larged. Sometimes a serous fluid is found fluctuating between the periosteum and bone.

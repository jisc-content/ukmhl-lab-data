57 nose or roof of the mouth, the membrane be conies red and inflamed, and a pimple forms on it; when this opens, the bony palate is exposed, and may be felt with the probe. The exposed bone in some time separates, and a communica- tion may be established between the mouth and nose, which gives a nasai sound to the voice, and allows of fluids passing from one cavity to the other. The discharge is thin and ichorous, and of very oflfensive smell. The tonsils also become affected with sores, having the character of chancre. The throat feels dry, and the in- flammation extends along the Eustachian tubes to the ear, producing acute pain and deafness., The mucous membrane covering the velum, and lining the back of the pharynx, is also liable to a similar state of ulceration. This not unfre- quently extends to the cervical vertebrse, and proves fatal by the destruction of the bones, or the opening of the vertebral artery. The mucous membrane of the cavity of the nose is occasionally attacked with syphilitic ulceration; a thin ichorous discharge, mixed witli clots of blood, escapes, and isÂ°often fol^ lowed by exfoliations of the spongy, and, at a later period,of the nasal bones, causingmuch deformity

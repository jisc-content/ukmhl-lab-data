85 Pterygoid Crystals.—These are of a wing-shape, connected by their acute ends^ and are more curious than important. Basic Triple Phosphate.—When artificially formed, as by a chemical re-agent, its appear- ance is that of a star, from which radii spring. When rapidly formed, the edges appear serrated and crenated. When slowly formed, they ap- pear broad foliaceous. They are easily recog- nised after a first view. Phosphate of Lime.—The prostate gland often secretes phosphate of lime, but it may be doubted if the urine has any such deposit. Abroad they assert that this salt appears in a crystallized form, but this opinion is not held in this country. When it does appear in certain diseased states of the mucous lining of the blad- der, the coats of the bladder have most likely secreted the same. Oxalate of Lime.—This salt is only to be detected by the microscope, and is recognised as forming the mulberry and the hempseed cal- culus. Management is required to detect the salt, as it frequently is found mixed with the lithate of ammonia.

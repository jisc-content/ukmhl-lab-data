CASES. 155 " The outward appearance of the parts show no marks of disease, at least so far as I can perceive. My chest has a few small spots, as also my chin and sides of my temples. " My present symptoms consist of pain at the mouth of the part when passing water, and great discharge, lowness of spirits, and want to sleep " No. 2. Mr. E. P. writes as follows:â€” " I am one of those unfortunate men who has ruined what was in early youth a remarkably robust constitution, by giving way to my ac- cursed self-gratification, which habit I acquired at school when only about 12 years of age, and continued sometimes as often as five and six times a week, until I was nearly 22, which was about a year ago, when, having met with your valuable work, its contents alarmed me, and opened my eyes to my ill-doings. " My mind and body are frightfully weakened, owing to my excessive nervousness, want of perception, and almost total loss of memory, with absence of mind and general debihty. I am unable to discharge the requirements of business with satisfaction ; indeed, unless speedily relieved, I fear I shall not be fit for any business at all.

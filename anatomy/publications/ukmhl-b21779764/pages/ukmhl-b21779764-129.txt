or central portion, and a tail, or globus minor, which forms its lowest extremity : from this the vas deferens escapes, and, turning upwards, ascends along the inner side of the epididymis, and enters the spermatic chord: a small tube, like an appendix vermiformis, terminating in a cul- de-sac, is sometimes found attached to the vas deferens in the situation of the globus minor. This is known hy the name of vas aberrans. The testis is supplied with blood from the spermatic artery. This vessel arises from the front of the abdominal aorta, a little below the venal artery : from this it descends outwards, in front of the psoas muscle and ureter, and behind the peritoneum, enters the internal ab- dominal ring, and is conducted by the sperma- tic chord to the upper and back part of the tes- tis, where it perforates the gland, and divides there into numerous branches, which terminate in the vascular coat of the testicle. The sper- matic veins ascend from the testis, in the sper- matic chord, in the lower part of which they v\'ind round the spermatic artery, forming a plexus, the CORPUS PAMPINIFORME: they afterwards become single, and terminate in the vena cava

35 The LIGAMENTUM TERES, OT ROUND LIGA- MENT, the most anterior, stretches from the fundus of the uterus forward and outward, de- scends along the mguinal canal, and terminates by spreading out in the labia. The round hga^ ment, besides its peculiar fibres, is accompanied by some muscular fibres of the uterus, and ar- terial branches from the spermatic artery. The Fallopian tube is about three to four inches in length; it runs from the side of the fundus uteri, outwards and upwards at first, and then a little downwards and backwards, and terminates in a loose fringed extremity, the CORPUS FiMBRiATUM, in the posterior surface of which is a small opening, the morsus dia- BOLi, by which the cavity of the uterus com- municates with that of the peritoneum, and where the serous membrane is continuous with the lining mucous membrane of the genital organs. The canal of the Fallopian tube is sma;ll neat the uterus, but inci-eases a little as it approaches the morsus diaboli: through it the ovum passes into the uterus from the ovary. The ovary is attached on each side to the fundus of the uterus by a round fibrotis imper- vious chord, the ligament of the ovary, about

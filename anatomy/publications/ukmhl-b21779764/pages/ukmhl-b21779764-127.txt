19 MAJOR of the epididymis, then through the body of the epididymis into its lower part, called GLOBUS MINOR, Or CAUDA, in the convoluted vas deferens. The vas deferens opens with the VESicuLA SEMiNALis into the urethra. Each TESTIS,* or testicle, is oval-shaped: that with its long axis directed obliquely downward, backward, and inward, whilst its upper extremity is turned a little outwards, is the larger; its outer surface is convex, and its inner flattened; its posterior, or upper part, is covered by the epi- didymis, and is pei-forated by the vessels of the gland. The testis possesses two coats, an outer, partial one, as described, from the tunica al- BUGiNEA, resembling the sclerotic coat of the eye, is of a bluish-white colour, and is com- posed of fibres interlaced together in all direc- tions ; from its inner surface several processes pass backward to the corpus hymenarium, orming the mediastinum testis. The inner surface of the tunica albuginea is hned by nu- merous vessels, forming a tunica vasculosa. * See Model at my private Anatomical Museum, :29 Georg-e Street, Hanover Square.

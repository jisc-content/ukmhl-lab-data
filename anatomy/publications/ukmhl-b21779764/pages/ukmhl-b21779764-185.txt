In the former, or simple hydrocele, their presence has been attributed to a wound of the testicle by the instrument used in operating; and in the encysted form to a rupture of one of the seminal tubuli. It has been already remarked that the tad- poles, or spermatozoa, are imperfect and defi- cient in the semen of mules, or hybrid animals.

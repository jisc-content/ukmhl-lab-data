Man has abused and misapplied his powers, in- troducing that which was never intended in na- ture, and, like man's works (unassisted by divine perception), entailed a curse on his bre- thren, proof of his vice and folly. An act without a motive, and that which is still worse, an act with a bad motive, must be an unnatural act— an act of folly, an act of madness.

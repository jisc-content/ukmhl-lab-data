24 forms, with the vas deferens, the ductus eja- cuLATORius COMMUNIS, as just described.

It is composed of an external fibrous or condensed cellular coat, and an internal mu- cous membrane. Their interior presents a sacculated appear- ance, not unlike that of the large intestines, the sacculi being smaller, but more distinct. Their use is to contain the semen, and probably also to secrete a peculiar fluid, to assist in the pro- cess of generation. They form, with the vasa deferentia, the lateral boundaries of tlie trian- gular space, through which the bladder is some- times punctured from the rectum. The PROSTATE GLANDS surround the neck of the bladder and prostatic portion of the urethra, which passes through it, nearer its upper than its lower surface, one third of the gland only being above the canal. This gland is some- what heart-shaped : the base, turned backwards, IS. notched in the centre, where the common ejaculatory ducta penetrates, separated by the

We might expect these animals, with the addition also of the chamois, to copulate together easil}', being nearly of the same size, very similar in internal structure, and accustomed to artificial domestic life, and to the society of each other from birth up- wards. There is a similar facility in some birds, where such unions are often fruitful, and produce prolific ofFspring. Thus the cock and hen canary birds produce with the hen and cock siskin and goldfinch; and the hen canary with the cock chaflinch, bullfinch, yellow ham- mer, and sparrow.

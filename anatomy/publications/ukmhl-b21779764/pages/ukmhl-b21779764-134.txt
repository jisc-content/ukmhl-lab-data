The su- perficial FASCIA lies beneath the skin; it is loose and reticular, and is derived fi-om a continuation of the superficial fascia of the ab- domen, which descends fi-om the pnbes, or the dorsum of the penis, forming the false suspen- sory LLGAMENT ; anteriorly it is continued into the prepuce. The superficial fascia of the penis communicates freely with that of the perineum and abdominal parietes: hence effusions of serum, urine, &c., pass freely into its cells. The FASCIA OF THE PENIS is a dense layer of cellular tissue, which invests the body of the penis, and is derived from the true suspen- sory LIGAMENT, a ti-iaiigular fibrous structin-e, which descends from the margins of the arch of the pubis on the penis, inclosing between the two lamina?, of which it consists, the dorsal ves- sels and nerves of the penis.

90 power to pay attention, for any given time, to any one object, proves his real condition to the experienced judgment of the practitioner and close observer. " The cerebral functions," says Professor Lal- lemand, "are not more weakened than the others, but the consequences of their derange- ment are much more serious, and more easily to be appreciated. It is soon observed that the memory becomes impaired, and the thread of ideas easily interrupted, and that the least men- tal irritation causes an afflux of blood towards the head. It is under similar tendencies that difficult digestion, long-continued constipation, distension of the abdomen by gas, &c., succeed, which ultimately excite congestions in the brain, now weakened and fatigued. " But these congestions are attended with a remarkable weakness of the pulse, coldness of the extremities, a feeling of general uneasiness, anxiety, agitation in all the senses, and an irre- sistible necessity for motion. These again arc followed by great paleness of face, general weak- ness, and a frightful prostration, without any part of the body being less affected than the other."

71 at first insipid, with, however, a certain decree of pungency ; after a little time it stimulates and excites a degree of warmth in the mouth. Vauqueline describes it as having a sharp and slightly stringent taste. Its specific gravity is greater than that of any other fluid in the body: it sinks into water, is coagulable by alcohol, is soluble in nitric and sulphuric acids, is softened by vegetable acids, evaporates by heat, loses its viscidity on the addition of lime- water, which, however, is increased by potash and soda, and it is thickened by ammonia. When exposed-to air it soon liquefies, and then becomes specifically lighter than before; but it always remains heavier than water. When it does liquefy, it will combine with water at any temperature, but it will not do so at the time of ejection, nor will water dissolve it at any temperature, from zero to the boiling point, if it should not have been previously liquefied. According to the detailed experiments of \'auqueline, which were published in the " An- nalcs dc Chemie" for 1794, and which have been quoted by Fourcroy, Richerand, and others, human semen appears to be composed of ninety

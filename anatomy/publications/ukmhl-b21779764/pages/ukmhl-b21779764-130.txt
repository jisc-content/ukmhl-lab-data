22 on the right side, but in the venal vein on the left. The spermatic plexus of nerves arises from the venal plexus, the splanchnic nerves, and some filaments from the lumbar gangliae of the sympathetic; they soon join the spermatic vessels, and descend with them to the testis. The lumbar plexus also sends a few branches to the spermatic chord and scrotum. The SPERMATIC CHORD is thus formed of the veins, nerves, absorbents, and excretory duct of the testis, the vas deferens, deferential artery, united by fine cellular tissue, and enclosed in the TUNICA VAGINALIS of THE CHORD, the degenerated portion of the peritoneum, and covered by the cremaster muscle. The vas deferens lies posteriorly in the chord, which it leaves at the internal abdominal ring: it here hooks round the epigastric artery, passes in- wards, backwards, and downwards across the psoas muscle and external iliac vessel-s, sinks into the pelvis, passing over the ureter and um- bilical artery, applies itself to the fixlse lateral ligament of the bladder, by which it is con- ducted to the inferior fundus of (lie organ, whence it runs - forwards and inwards along the

58 Syphilitic Eruptions are liable to much variety. A morbid state: of the skin is one of the earlier and more important indications of the system having become tainted with the syphilitic poison; it is also one of the most remote effects of that poison. This morbid state may become manifest in any one of the ■different forms which skin diseases are apt to .assume; but it is more commonly observed under certain forms than others. The most common kind met with is the copper-coloured eruption, in which the blotches rise a little above the surface of the skin, and, if they £0 on to ulceration, form thick incrustations. They are attended with very little pain ; an itching, rather than a painful sensation, is felt in the part, and increases towards evening. In some the eruption is of con- siderable magnitude, but is unattended W'ith ulceration; in others, ulceration will be ob- served, with a very ragged edge. The parts in which venereal eruptions form most frc- (juently are the head, face, and roots of the hair, the back of the neck and shoulders, and palms of the hand. In some, the whole surface of the skin is covered over with the eruption.

It is usually described as consisting of two lateral lobes, and a small con- necting inferior third lobe(HoRNE's lobe). This division is very arbitrary and indistinct. The under surface of the gland rests on the rectum. The prostate gland is covered by a dense fibrous capsule, which is derived from the tri- angular hgament, and gives to it its firm feel; but according to some authors, it is derived from the pelvic fascia: its internal structure is composed of a congeries of mucous follicles, united by cellular tissue. Its use is to secrete a fluid supposed to be useful in generation: this is conveyed into the urethra by means of nu- merous ducts, about ten on each side, which open on each of the verumontanum. The coverings of the penis are the skin, su- perficial fascia, and ftiscia of the penis.

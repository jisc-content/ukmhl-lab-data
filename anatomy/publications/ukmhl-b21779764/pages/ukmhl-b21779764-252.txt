144 East or West Indies and Australia, £10 and £20 cases of Medicine are prepared, so that there may not he any intermission in taking the same, ivhere perseverance is absolutely necessary. As it frequently happens that there are pecu- liarities in certain casesj which require a different treatment, Dr. Jordan wishes to impress on the mind of the patient the importance (where an interview is impossible), of having the urine tested by means of the Microscope. It will, therefore, be advisable to send a small flask securely packed in a basket, at the same time enclosing a bank-note or bill on a London house for £10 or £20, in order to have a packet of medicine sent out by the next mail, which would, in all probability, be sufficient to meet the exigencies of all cases. By thus acting a considerable delay is saved; whereas, by writing for advice, a period of five or six months is lost in corresponderlce before the proper remedies can be forwarded, and in this period the patient gets rapidly worse, so as frequently to render all attempts at restoration perfectly abortive. Parcels, securely packed, and protected from observation, forwarded to any part of the world.

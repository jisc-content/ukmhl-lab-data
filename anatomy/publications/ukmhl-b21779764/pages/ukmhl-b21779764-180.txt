72 parts of water, six of common animal muci- lage, three of phosphate of lime, and one of soda. It exhibits a very marked alkaline cha- racterj changing the syrup of violets gi-een, ovi^ing to the s6da which it contains. The animal mucilage is not pure albumen; but Richerand observes it should rather be con- sidered as a gelatinous mucus, on which its indissolubility in water, its odour, and spon- taneous liquefaction, seems to depend. It must be observed, in connection with the efficacy of microscopic examination, that coiji- petency to use that instrument with advajitage can only he acquired by a long course of studiji and practice. It is composed of innumerable parts, the proper working of all depending on the perfect order and skilful handling of each; and the least awkwardness or error in the adjustment of any of them may disarrange the whole pro- ceeding. It is through this circumstance that many who have attempted micvoscopic in- quiries without acquiring a sufficient amount of experience, have from time to time fallen inio ,^:tic/( serious mistaken.

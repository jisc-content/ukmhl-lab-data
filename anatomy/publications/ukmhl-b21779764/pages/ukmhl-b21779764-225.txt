117 nied the consolation of pity. Debilitated, spirit- less, frail humanity can scarcely be recognised in the abject thing, the shadow of man. Woman has in him her greatest enemy ; and should avarice or fraud force her to a union with so lost a creature, what can her prospect be during life ? And should, by some extraordinary unlooked- for circumstance, an offspring be the fruit of so sinful a marriage, the child will become the livdng witness of a father's crime, to haunt, with its sickly, puny form, the source of all its woes, while she, the pure, the devoted one, granted in mercy by providence to be the guardian and preserver of the human race, will vainly endea- vour, with her life's best blood, to impart strength to a Aveak branch from a blighted stem. In vain are nightly watchings, daily attentions, caresses, received with idiotic gaze, no pulpy lip to receive the fond mother's kiss, no laughing eye to com- pensate for natural and maternal tenderness. The infant, like the changeling we read of in fairy tales, bears the stamp of the father's guilt; old, though young, dying on the threshold of existence, with the light of life too strong for its enfeebled faculties.

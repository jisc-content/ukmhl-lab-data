The CLiTOKis lies within the vulva, between tTie labia, immediately below the mons veneris; it is analogous to the organ in the male: it arises by two crura, one on each side, from the rami of the pubes, which unite to form one body, the clitoris, which, expanding in front, forms the glans clitortdis : this is partially covered with a fold of the integument called the PREPUCE, The clitoris is erectile,,but at the same time does not possess any canal. The nym- phs, or LABi^ MiNOPwE, descend from the pre- puce downwards and outwards, and are gra- dually lost near the orifice of the vagina. Be- tween the nymphae, having the clitoris above, and the orifice of the vagina beneath, is the external opening of the meatus urinariu?, or URETHRA.

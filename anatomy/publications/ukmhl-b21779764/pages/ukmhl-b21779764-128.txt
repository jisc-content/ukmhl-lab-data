20 The interior of the testis is composed of a soft reddish-gray pulpy substance, formed of a num- ber of small vessels, the tubuli seminiferi,^ loosely connected by cellular tissue : these are collected into bundles, separated by the pro- cesses which are sent off' from the inner sur- face of the tunica albuginea. From these bundles about fifteen or twenty tubes pass, directly backward, to the posterior part of the gland, and are called the tubuli recti : they enter the mediastinum testis, and then, running be- tween the two layers of the corpus hymena- rium, form from the upper part of this structure from ten to fifteen vessels, under the name of VASA DEFERENTiA, perforate the tunica albu- ginea, and enter the upper part of the epididy- mis, where they become tortuous, and receive the name coni vasculosi, which unite ulti- mately into one tube, and form the vas defe- rens, which, being convoluted, descends, form- ing part of the globus major and the whole of the GLOBUS MINOR of the epididymis. The epididymis, applied to the upper and back part of the testis, is composed of a head, or GLOBUS MAJOR, or upper extremity, a body

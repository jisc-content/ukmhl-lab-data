76 the organism in which they exist. A sperma- tozoa consists of a flattened, oval, and perfectly- transparent body, terminating in a fihform tapering tail, which together measures from one-fiftieth to one-fortieth of a line in length. Wagner has shown that they are developed within cells, and originate from the spermatic granules, being formed by the dispersion of the nuclei of these cells. These animalculee are peculiar to the sper- matic fluid, and constitute the chief charac- teristic of this secretion. They live for many hours after they have been ejected from the urethra ; the application of blood does not in- jure them, but that of urine renders their mo- tions feeble, and hastens their death. The spermatic fluid also contains a number of minute, round, colourless, granular corpus- cles, which vary in quantity, but are usually much less numerous than the spermatozoa. Both these elements of the sperm are suspended in a clear transparent fluid, termed the Uqiior semims, or seminal liquor. The quantity of semi- nal fluid emitted during the act of sexual con^ gress varies from one to two or three drachms.

36 two inches in length. The ovaria resemble the testes somewhat as to size and shape: thej- are more irregular than these, and often pre- sent cicatrices on their surface. The ovary is covered externally by peritoneum, beneath which is a strong fibrous capsule, analogous to, but not so dense as, the tunica albuginea: within these, united by firm cellular tissue, named stroma, and vessels, is a number of vesicles, the Graafian vesicles, which contain the ova. These Graafian vesicles vary much in number from fifteen to thirty, and sometimes rhore; they vary also as to size, those on the surface being the larger. Each Graafian vessel is now described as containing an albuminous liquid, and a round little body, which is the real ovum, surrounded by two membranes, the external one vascular, the internal one, named the ovi-capsule, pre- senting an internal granular surface. When a Graafian vesicle is ruptured, its contents find their way into the uterus by the Fallopian tube, and its place is supplied by a new deposit, which, from the colour assumed, is named cor- pus LUTEUM. Each little real ovum is said to have its pro-

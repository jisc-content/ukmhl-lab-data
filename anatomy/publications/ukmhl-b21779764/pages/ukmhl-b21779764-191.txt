83 When ui-ea, lithic acid, earthy phosphates, and particularly the aramonio-raagnesian, is mixed with the phosphate of lime, spasmodic action to the muscles is given, and when the mucous lining is in an irritable state, potass,, ammonia, and soda cause spasm of the urethral muscles. In order, however, to arrive at a certain know- ledge of the properties of the urine, the MrcRo- scoPK alone will insure a satisfactory result. Urea.—The nitrate of urea may be easily known by its forming a sort of scaly crystals. Lithic acid.—The shape mostly taken by this substance is that of the rhombic, or quadrangular; it is thin, transparent, and of a yellow amber colour. This substance sometimes takes other forms, such as that of cubes, or ser- rated tables, some even believing to have seen it take the form of cylinders, but the usual forms are the first mentioned. LiTHATE OF Ammonia.—This salt is easily recognised; it is more easily rendered soluble in warm than in cold fluid, and by warming the urine, should the same be turbid, it will be ren- dered perfectly clear by the process of the test

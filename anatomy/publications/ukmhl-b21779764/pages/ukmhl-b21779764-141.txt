The internal organs of generation are the UTERUS and its appendages on each side ; the ligaraentum teres, fallopian tube, and ovary. The uterus lies between the bladder and rec- t (uni : it is pyriform in shape, and is described as consisting of a fundus, body, and cervix : the larger extremity, or fundus, is free and rounded^ and is turned upwards and forwards ; from thi's the body contracts to its cervix, which is sur- rounded by the vagina.

inner side of the vesicula senrtinalis, and, at ths base of the prostate gland, terminates, by join- ing att an acute artgle the duct of the corre- sponding vesicula, to form the ductus ejacTula- Toiilus COMMUNIS, which, running forwards and inwards through the substance of the pro- state gland, opens on the anterior part of the verumontanum. The vas deferertsi'is composed of two coats, an external fibrous a;nd an inter- nal mucous: the fibrous coat is of ffi-eat strength, and gives to it the feel of whipcord: its cavity is exceedingly small. The vas defe- rens is flattened and sacculated, where it is connected to the inferior fundus of the bladder ; its fibrous coat does not penetrate the prostate gland. The VESICULA SEMiNALES, two in number, are attached to the inferior fundus of the blad- der, where they lie, one on each side, parallel and external to the vas deferens: they are about two inches in length, convoluted, ob- long, and pyriform in shape: the larger extre- mity is obtuse, and turned backwards and out- wards : their smaller extremity, directed for- wards and inwards, terminates in a duct, which

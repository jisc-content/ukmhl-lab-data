154 CASES. No. 1. Case of F. G. Â« I am nineteen years of age; sober and tem- perate, and scarcely ever drink wine, whiskey, or any exciting liquor. I had but once intercourse with one of the female sex, which was about four months ago, after which .... I have a sad habit of exciting myself .... I intend to use all my exertions to leave off doing so, though I find it a very hard matter, the habit being almost confirmed. " The first thing I observed on my ... . was- a spot which came on the side of it, having the appearance of a large pimple that was ripe and ready to burst; but that is gone off, and left a little redness. About three weeks ago I felt now and then a slight inclination to void my urine, and, when I did so, had scarcely any ; and after a while I got worse, indeed, so bad, that at times I could not keep it; and whilst doing so, I felt a tickUng hot pain, particularly about the mouth of the canal, and the desire to cause my lu-ine to flow would increase every day, as also the pain. Having taken a medicine which was recommended to me, I injected some, and I regret to say it has done me more harm than good, for I perceive I have a, great running of a slightly greyish thick stuff, which has a very disagreeable smell: it did not do so before.

82 sulphuric acid. Bile is also sometimes ob- served, and frequently uric acid is found in in- creased quantity. The urine is secreted by the minute branches of the renal artery into the tubuli uriniferi; after which it passes through the papill.e or mam- mary PROCESSES, into the calices. These uniting, form three or four principal tubes, named infundibula, which terminate in the pel- vis of the kidney. The pelvis contracting forms the ureter, which carries the urine to the bladder. The oblique manner in which the ureters pe- netrate the bladder prevents the urine from re- turning ; the inner membrane of the bladder, lying over the opening, produces the effect of a valve. It is also believed to be intended to prevent such over-distension of the bladder as might lead to rupture the same. As^oon as there is a certain quantity of urine in the bladder we feel an inclination to dis- charge it. This we effect partly by the con- traction of the bladder itself, and partly by the action of the abdominal muscles and diaphragm, which press the intestines against the bladder.

Abscesses sometimes are formed along the course of the urethra, or in the perineo, in severe cases of gonorrhoea. In the former, they seem to be caused by inflammation attacking the lacunte, in which the abscess is formed, and then bursts in the urethra: in the latter, Cow- per's glands are generally affected: these may burst either into the urethra or in perineo, thus giving rise to a fistula in perineo. As these ab- scesses frequently cause retention of urine be- fore bursting, an accurate examination is indis- pensable whenever they are suspected to exist.

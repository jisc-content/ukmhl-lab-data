18 tunica vaginalis. Should, this obliteration not take place, a congenital hernia may be formed by the descent of a hernia into the tunica vagi- nalis, or a congenital hydrocele. The tunica vaginalis surrounds the testis, except at its upper and back part; it is then reflexed on the sides of the epididymis, forming a cul-de-sac on the outer side, between the testis and epididy- mis, from which it ascends, to a short distance, on the lateral and anterior surfaces of the chord ; from the chord it passes off and lines the inner surface of the scrotum. The layer of the tunica vaginalis which covers the testis is called the TUNICA VAGINALIS TESTIS, and that which lines the scrotum, the tunica vaginalis SCROTI. This membrane is lubricated by a thin serous fluid, which allows of the free motion of the testis. It is often the seat of the disease called hydrocele. The semen is secreted by the minute branches of the spermatic arteries in the testicles. It passes through the tubuli seminiferi into the vasa recta; contained in thfe rete testis, the semen passes by the vasa deferentia into the coNi vAscuLosi, forming the head or globus

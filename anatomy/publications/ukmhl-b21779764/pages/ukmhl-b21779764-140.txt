It is generally partially closed in the virgin state, near its anterior extremity, by a crescentic fold of mucous membrane, coiicave upwards, named the HYMEN. The rupture, or gradual oblitera- tion of this, leaves in the adult irregular pro- jections, the CARUNCUL.E MYSTiFORMEs. Ex- ternal to the mucous membrane, the vagina is -covered with a fibrous membrane, on the exte- rior of which is the PLEXUS retiformes, com- posed chiefly of veins, and supposed to be -erectile. The vagina receives a partial cover- ing of peritoneum, near to its attachment to the uterus. The perineum in the female extends from the inferior commissure to the os coccygis; it con- tains analogous muscles to tlie male, viz. the sphincter ani, levator ani, coccygyteus, trans- versus perinei, and erector clitoridis.

8 the tender vow of everlasting affection: lost at times in a religious feeling, they consider each other as beings of a superior order. In the widely-extended universe they behold no other felicity but that of living and dying toge- ther ; or, rather, they have lost all sight of death. Holy love transports them into ages of infinite duration, and death seems to them only the transition to an eternal union. Even when des- tiny separates them, little consolation can be afforded them by friendship or fortune: they had tasted heavenly joys, and languish on earth long after their separation. When age even has frozen up the current of sense, aftei having been distracted by numberless anxie- ties foreign to the heart, the bosom still palpi- tates at sisiht of the tomb which contains the object once so purely and tenderly loved. It is to the charms of virtue, and the sentiment of her divine attributes, love is indebted for all that enthusiastic energy, the cause of so many glorious deeds which crowd the page of history. •■ All the works of nature have for their end to supply the wants of man, and all the sentiments of man should have for their principle, the Deity.

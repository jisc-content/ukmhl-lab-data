28 whence 'it is afterwards removed by the veins. A peculiar set of arteries, which^ terminate in dilated extremities (helicine arteries), have been described by some. Between the corpora cavernosa, superiorly, a groove exists, in which the dorsal vessels and nerves of the penis run ; a similar groove is seen on the under surface, in which is lodged the corpus spongiosum ure- THR.E. This body completes the penis, and has been described with the urethra; it is conti- nued anteriorly in front of the extremity of the corpora cavernosa, where it expands and forms the GLANs PENIS ; this body, conical in shape, is attached at its base to the anterior part of the corpora cavernosa by cellular tissue: it presents here a circular indentation, the cernix, in front of which is a projecting ridge, the corona GLANDis: these parts contain a number of seba- ceous glands, the glandulee odoriferfe, or Tysion. The cells of the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum urethras do not communicate. The penis is suj^plied with blood by branches of the internal pudicarteries, as follows:â€”1st. arteri.e DORSALEs penis, ruji in the groove on the dorsum of the penis, and terminate by forming a vascu-

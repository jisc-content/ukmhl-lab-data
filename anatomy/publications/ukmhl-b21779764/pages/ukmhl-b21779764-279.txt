171 CASES. No. 13. , M.P. for the county of ■, writes:—• Sir,—I have had the misfortune, in common with others, to allow my passions to get the better of my reason^ and pursued a practice equally pernicious to body and soul. I am sink- ing to an early grave by a continual loss of seminal fluid; my complexion is cadaverous, and movements checked by weakness in the legs and loins, so great as to cause me at times to grasp at the different articles of furniture whilst crossing from one end of the apartment to the other. I cannot believe any one was ever doomed to such pangs as 1 am experiencing. Without a miraculous intervention of Providence I cannot last long. Should there be any chance of only restoring to me the calmness of mind I enjoyed in former days, by checking seminal losses, I should feel but too happy to remu- nerate your exertions to the full extent of my power. As to a total re-establishment of health, this I know to be perfectly impossible, since my feelings have completely changed, from a lively disposition to that of a dejected and even sullen character. Trusting you will take my case into most serious consideration, I remain. Sir," &c. It will scarcely be necessary to add that the cases mentioned, after the usual remedies had been employed, were brought to a happy issue. The majority availed themselves of the advantage gained by a personal interview, which rendered the time employed in the cure of the complaints much shorter than if treated by correspondence.

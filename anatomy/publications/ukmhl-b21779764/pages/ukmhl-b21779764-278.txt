170 CASES. account of my present symptoms, which 1 enclose. Lastly, I would beg of you to take my case into your most serious consider- ation, as I shall be obliged to consummate a marriage next July, with a lady to whom I am engaged. It is a ' family agreement,' and there- fore unavoidable, which you will easily under- stand. I would merely add, my position in society is such as to enable me to follow any course of treatment you may think necessary. My age is 22, live generously, and have been guilty of self-abuse for many years, and suffer from pains in the head night and morning, sensation of sickness at the pit of the stomach, giddiness in the head after dinner, with burning of the cheeks, and flushed appearance ; motions costive, and then again much relaxed, with a running from the penis after the least exertion ; the water at times quite white, and at other times of colour like blood, which leaves a sedi- ment. Nightly emissions continue to take place, testicles lax, and slightly pendulous at niglit and morning: I wear a purse to relieve them, and cannot effect an erection without great trouble; when produced, spontaneous emissions take place with or without an erection, only requiring contact with a woman.

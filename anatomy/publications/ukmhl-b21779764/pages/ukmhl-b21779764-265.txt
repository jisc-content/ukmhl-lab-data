In the first place, my left testicle is still wrong, reduced in size, soft, and very tender. I have also a dull pain all down the thigh and calf of my leg, varying according to the amount of exercise I take; my penis is always more or less inflamed, sloiivelled, and tender, particur- larly the foreskin, which looks angry, and seems to have left its original position close to the glands of the penis: after sponging with cold water, upon drawing it forward over the neck it seems to turn under, causing for some time an uneasy feeling. During evacuation semen escapes, but not as yet to any great extent. My health is any thing but bad, as my constitu- tion originally was very good: how long my strength will bear up I know not, but I leave all to your better judgment."

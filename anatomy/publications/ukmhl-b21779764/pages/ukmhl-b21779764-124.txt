]G The DARTOs is a thin layer of pink contrac- tile fihres lying beneath the skin, surrounding each testicle, and uniting in the median line passing between the testicles, forming the SEPTUM SCROTI: by some this part is supposed to be of vessels only : its use is to support the testicle and corrugate the scrotum. Cold is its peculiar stimulus. The dartos is considered by many to be a continuation of the superficial fascia of the abdomen. The INTERCOLUMNAR FASCIA extends down- wards upon the chord from the external abdo- minal ring, where it is most evident; it then descends m a more slender form, spreading out upon the scrotum. The CREMASTER muscle, with its fibres con- nected together by cellular tissue, forms the cremasteric fascia, passing down from the lower border of the internal oblique and sometimes transversalis muscle, in the . shape of loops on the chord, as low as the lower part of the tes- ticle and scrotum. Its use is to sustain and raise the testicle, and even slightly to compress the same. WheVe there is an old hernia or rupture, the fibres are much increased in size.

TPIE MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION are the testes, with their appendages, the vesi- culte seminales, prostate gland, Cowper's gland, the penis. The testes are inclosed in the scrotum : the scrotum is composed of the skin, DARTOS, INTERCOLUMNAR FASCIA, CREMASTER, FASCIA TKANSVERSALtS, the TUNICA VAGIN-ALIS SCROTI. The skin of the scrotum is of a thin sub- stance, and of rather a brown colour, and slightly covered over with hairs; on all sides continuous with the surrounding integuments, or coverings, the veins of the scrotum may be . easily seen through it. Sometimes these veins are opened when the testicles are diseased. On the mesial line of the scrotum is the raphe, produced by a thickening of the integu- ments; it is continuous with the raphe of the perineum behind, and is lost anteriorly in the under surface of the organ.

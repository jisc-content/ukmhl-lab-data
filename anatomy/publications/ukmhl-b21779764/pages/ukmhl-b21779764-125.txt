The FASCIA TRANSVERSALIS, Or INTERNAL INFUNDIBULIFORM, as some authors call it, passes down upon the spermatic chord, and expands over the scrotum, between the cremas- ter and tunica vaginalis. This structure, toge- ther with some sub-peritoneal reticulated tissue, passing down on the chord, forms the fascia PROPRIA of Sir Astley Cooper. The TUNICA vaginalis is a serous sac, en- closing each testis, separated from each other by the septum scroti, formed by an inward reflection of the dartos and cellular tissue in the mesial line. The tunica vaginalis was, in the first, a process of peritoneum, brought down by the testis in its descent from the abdomen. Before the seventh month this gland is lodged on the psoas muscle below the kidneys. It then begins to descend along the inguinal canal, and finally passes into the scrotum, where it is usually found at the birth, or immediately after. The process of the peritoneum, which descends with the testis, becomes generally closed, at its upper part, by adhesive inflammation, by which the lower portion is cut off from tbe general peritoneal surface, thus forming the sac of (he

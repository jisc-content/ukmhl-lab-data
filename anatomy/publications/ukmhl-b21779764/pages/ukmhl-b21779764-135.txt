spongiosum urethras. Each corpus cavesend- SUM commences by a narrow-pointed, or some- times obtuse extremity, whicli is attached to the inner surface of the tuber ischii and rami of the ischium and pubes, whence, pasBj^is^ forwards and inwards, it terminates in the corpus caver- nosum ; this immediately unites with the corpus cavernosum from the opposite side ; the two, thus united, pass forwai'd, and terminate behind the glans jienis in a bHnd obtvise exti'emity. The corporae caveniosae are covered externally by a dense fibrous, whitish, elastic membrane, of some thickness ; this ends, on the mesial line, in an imperfect septum, the septum pectinifotim, which partially separates the two bodies, but at the same time allows a communication between their cells, particularly anteriorly. Numerous processes are given off from this coat to the interior, under the name of trcebecxil.e, to support and conduct the vessels. In the inte- rior of this fibrous covering is ah erectile spongy tissue, of a reddish colour, supposed by some to be composed of a congeries of arteries and veins ; by others, of cells into which the blood is poured during the erection ^of the organ.

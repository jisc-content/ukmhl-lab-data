Phymosis is an elongated condition of the prepuce, which haugs over and conceals the glans. It is caused by inflammation, which terminates in an eflfusion of serum, or lymph, or both, into the cellular tissue of the prepuce'. Sometimes the inflammation will increase, and end in sloughing, unless properly attended to. Paraphymosis is the reverse of phymosis. In this the constricted prepuce is retracted be- hind the corona glandis, and cannot be drawn forwards. The edge of the prepuce, constrict- ing the corona glandis, will, if allowed to re- main, cause a sloughing of the glans penis, or will liberate itself by acting on the constricted part.

19 PLATE XX. Miliary, indurated, and suppurative tubercles, and vomicae of the lungs. Fig. 1. A portion of lung loaded with miliary tubercles. 2. A portion of lung studded with indurated miliary tubercles. 3. A portion of the left lung considerably reduced in size, with a large tuberculous excavation in the superior part of it, and other smaller cavities filled with cheese-like matter. 4. One very large tuberculous excavation, with a fibro-cartilaginous state of the bands crossing it. 5. Vomicae, with condensation of the intervening tissue of the lung. Symp. Incipient Tubercles—Short dry cough, dyspnoea, dull heavy pain at the scrobiculus cordis; fatigued on the slightest motion; venous inactivity around the nasal and ocular portions of the face; dry skin, with a florid state of the mucous tissue of the lips. Suppurative Tubercle—Increased cough, accom- panied with copious expectoration of a muco-purulent matter, suppression of the catamenia, colliquative per- spiration, and diarrhoea; skin pale, shrivelled, and sometimes dry; intense heat in the soles of the feet and palms of the hand; nose sharp, cheeks prominent, with a purplish blush; pearly appearance of the con- junctiva of the eyes; nails elongated and curved; tormina. Morbid Anat. On the surface and in the substance of the lung are generally found the vesiculated, granular, or indurated cheese-like tubercle; sometimes all these might be met with in the same lung; after the vesicu- lated stage is past, they have the appearance of in- durated glands, are of different sizes, and are often found in clusters. Their firmness is usually in pro- portion to their size, and when laid open in this state they are of a white colour, and of a consistence nearly

10 Morb. Ap. Of Hydrocephalusâ€”On removing the scalp the bones are found to be very thin, and there are frequently broad spots of membrane in them. These appearances are however only to be observed when the disease has been of long continuance. In some cases, where the quantity of water is not great, the substance of the brain appears to be indurated, and in others softened. We frequently find within the cranium the veins, particularly those of the membranes on the surface of the brain and lining of the ventricles, gorged with dark blood; sometimes considerable ad- hesions and thickening of the membranes and minute and florid vessels upon the pia mater : collections also of a viscid tenacious matter have been disco- vered, in cysts, upon its external surface, and tumpurs have been found attached to its substance.

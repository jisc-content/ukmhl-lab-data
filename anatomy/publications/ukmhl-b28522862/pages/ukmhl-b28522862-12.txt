IV PREFACE. life, and a true Description of the Morbid Changes that are exhibited after death. The Sketches are made either from diseased parts in the Authors Museum, or from recent dis- section ; and it is hoped, the arrangement will render the work convenient, both for occasional reference and regular perusal. It has not been deemed necessary to give Cases, nor to introduce all the strange appearances that are occasionally found after death : the Author has preferred a brief Statement of Symptoms and Mor- bid Phenomena in Diseases the most likely to fall under the daily notice of the Practitioner, than to any speculative hypothesis, or rare or doubtful subjects. The Author, although his name is not appended to the work, is however happy in having this fa- vourable opportunity of publicly returning his sin- cere thanks for the kindness he has received from his numerous medical friends ; and he cannot con- clude this short Preface without presenting to those who have executed the Sketches, his grateful thanks for the faithfulness and ability with which they are depicted. London, 1830.

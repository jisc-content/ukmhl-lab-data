17 you will find the membrane highly injected, and gene- rally of a dark colour, which soon becomes more red on being exposed to the air, when the mucous secretion is removed. The substance of the lung itself is gorged with venous and arterial blood. If you press the end of your finger upon the part most affected, the impres- sion remains. If you slice the lung, and squeeze the divided portions, a mucus or muco-purulent fluid will issue from the cut surfaces, similar to that contained in the bronchial passages. Symp. Of Pneumoniaâ€”Dyspnoea, accompanied with a weight and sense of oppression in the thoracic cavity, metallic cough, expectoration of a dark yellowish, or yellowish green lymph, which adheres firmly to the sides of the vessel, crepitation in some part or parts of the chest, flushed countenance. Morbid Anat. The lung is heavier than in its natural state, and presents on its surface a livid or violet colour, and a degree of firmness much greater. It is, however, still crepitous; but when pressed between the fingers it is very apparent that it is gorged with a fluid, and that the crepitation is much less than in the healthy state. When cut, its tissue appears of a livid red, and alto- gether filled with a serous fluid, more or less bloody and frothy, which exudes in abundance from the divided surfaces. In the second stage there is no crackling whatever of the lung on its being pressed between the fingers, and it then acquires a degree of firmness and solidity similar to that of the liver. In the third stage the pulmonary tissue preserves the same firmness and granular appearance, assumes a pale yellow colour, and pours out, in greater or less abundance, from its divided surfaces, a yellow, opaque, viscid* and evidently puriform matter. c

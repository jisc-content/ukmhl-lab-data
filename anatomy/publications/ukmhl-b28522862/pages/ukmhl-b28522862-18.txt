2 nearly three quarters of an inch in thickness; when removed from the skull, the bone or bones are found to be very much destroyed by absorption, particularly the outer table, and its texture resembles that of coarse spunge, but very white. In such cases you generally find some organic de- rangement within the cranium. PLATE II. Acute and chronic inflammation of the dura mater are repre- sented in this Plate. Fig. 1. Exhibits at one view acute inflammation and soften- ing of the dura mater, and an enlarged state of the pacchionian glands, situated within the lon- gitudinal sinus. a Longitudinal sinus split open. b Softening, lesion, and separation of the laminae com- posing the dura mater. c Injected and arborescent state of the venous capil- lary vessels of the dura mater. Symp. Nausea, thirst, headach; quick, full, and hard pulse; restlessness, pain, and corded sensation of the head. Morbid Anat. The dura mater presents a degree of red- ness more or less intense, and the venous capillary vessels are seen to be dilated and loaded with blood of a vermilion colour. Sometimes lymph is found effused on its surface, but more frequently pus, particularly so if an injury has been the exciting cause. The dura mater is sometimes found firmly united to the inner table of the cranium, and sometimes to the arachnoid membrane and pia mater. Softening of the dura mater is not a very common affection, although I have met with several cases within the last ten years.

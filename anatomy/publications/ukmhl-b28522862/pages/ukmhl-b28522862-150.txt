26 PLATE XXIX. Cartilaginous and bony deposition on the valves of the heart. Fig. 1. An extensive dilatation of the foramen ovale. 2. A mulberry-like tumour, the size of a pigeon’s egg, firmly attached to the inner surface of the auricle. 3. An opening in the septum ventriculorum. 4. Cartilaginous state of the corpora sesamoidea, and a reticulated state of the semilunar valves. a b Reticulated portions. Fig. 5. The superior margins of the semilunar valves completely encased in bone. 6. A deposition of cartilaginous matter between the layers of the serous membrane forming the mitral valve. 7. Ossific and cartilaginous deposition in the sub- stance of the tricuspid valve. Svmp. Blue or violet colour of the skin and mucous tissue of the body, dyspnoea, palpitation of the heart, syn- cope. , Ossif. of Semilunar Valves—Dyspnoea, aggravated on motion, palpitation, intermittent pulse, face gene- rally violet or brick-red colour. Ossif. of Mitral and Tricuspid Valves—Dyspnoea, increased on the slightest motion, irregular action of the heart at its pericardial region, while the pulse at the wrist is small and feeble; purplish hue of counte- nance. Morbid Anat. Tumours situated in the auricles generally have a proper capsule, besides the envelope they re- ceive from the serous lining of the heart. The proper capsule is smooth externally, but internally it has more the character of loose cellular tissue, and apparently enters into the composition of the tumour. The sub-

1G Fig. 2. Dilated bronchia—ramifications, which, in the natural state, would scarcely admit a fine probe, acquire a diameter equal to that of a crow-quill, or a goose-quill, or even of the finger. 3. A dilated bronchial tube terminating in a cul- de-sac. 4. Ulceration of the bronchial valve and mucous tis- sue lining the edge of the tube. 5. Fungoid excrescence arising from the edge of one of the bronchial apertures. 6. Rupture of the delicate membrane forming the bronchial valve. 7. A small fleshy excrescence arising from the mucous tissue of the bronchial membrane. 8. The calibre of the left bronchus and its bifurca- tions diminished from a thickening of the mucous tissue. 9. A transverse section of the lower end of the trachea, showing its calibre reduced in size from thickening of the mucous membrane. 10. The calibre of the left bronchus reduced in size by a deposition of a fibro-cartilaginous matter be- tween the laminae of the mucous tissue. 11. Concretions expectorated from the lungs. 12. A large chalky concretion expectorated from the pulmonary organ. 13. Lobulated hydatid taken from the substance of the lungs of a person who died of phthisis. Symp. Bronchitis—Dyspnoea, loose, deep, and diffused cough, accompanied with a stuffing noise, copious and loose expectoration, purple, violet, or leaden colour of the lips and cheeks, soft and compressible pulse. Dilatation of the Bronchia—Over the seat of the principal dilatations pectoriloquism, more or less per- fect, is perceived, together with a loud mucous rattle, precisely like the cavernous rattle of phthisis. Morb. An at. The bronchial membrane is generally covered with mucus, and if you wipe that off with a sponge,

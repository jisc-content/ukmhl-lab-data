4 b Highly injected state of the vessels of the pia mater, with a deposition of lymph between the convolu- tions of the brain. c Bloody points in the substance of the hemisphere. Symp. Arachnitis—Headach, sense of constriction over the eyebrows, injected state of the eyes, heat of the scalp, nausea, agitation. Pia Mater—Intense throbbing pain in the head, increase of heat, flushing of the face, injected state of the eyes, disturbed functions, want of sleep, delirium. Substance of the Brain—Weight and sense of hea- viness in the head, numbness of one or more of the extremities, ringing in the ears, irritability of the retina, deceptive vision, convulsions, paralysis, coma. Morbid Anat. Thickening of the arachnoid membrane is generally the consequence of chronic inflammation. It has sometimes acquired the thickness of the pleura, of the pericardium, of the dura mater, and even as thick as the coats of the stomach. Inf. of the Pia Mater—The minute capillary ves- sels are much more numerous than in its natural state, are filled with florid blood, and form, by their anasto- mosis, a beautiful network. Substance of the Brain—The inflamed portion be- comes of a red colour, although this is seldom very intense; when cut into, the colour is found to arise from a great many small vessels which are filled with blood. The part which is inflamed has no peculiar hardness, but yields nearly the same sensation to the touch as it would do in a healthy state. Fig. 2.

Softening of the muscular fibres of the lower and lateral portion of the right side of the heart. 6. Softening, attenuation, and rupture of the muscular fibres of the apex of the heart. Symp. Inf. internal Lining—Agonizing pain in the peri- cardial region, dyspnoea, concentration of heat over the site of the organ; jactitation, with great expression of distress depicted in the countenance ; pulse full, quick, and wiry. Softening of the Heart—Dull obscure pain in the region of the heart, pallid countenance, pulse small and soft, and sometimes intermittent; slight exertion at times produces syncope; the lips are seldom purple, and still more rarely swollen, but on the contrary almost always colourless. Polypus—In cases where the heart has been acting regularly, if the pulsations suddenly become anoma- lous, obscure, and confused, so as not to be analyzed, we may suspect the formation of a polypus. If the disordered action exists on one side of the heart only, we may consider the thing as almost certain. Morbid Anat. Of Softening—The muscular fibres are soft, and easily tom; sometimes the softening takes place only on one side of the organ. It is of a dark red or brown colour in the acute stage, pale and yellowish in the chronic. Plate XXVIII. Fig. 1. Deposition of an earthy matter in the muscular substance of the heart. 2.

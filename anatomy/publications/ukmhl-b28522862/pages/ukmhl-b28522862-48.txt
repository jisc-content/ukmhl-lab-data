Scrofulous tumours, situated within the lateral ventricle, and arising from the thalamus and corpus striatum. 4. Circumscribed melenosis of the cerebral texture. 5.

Of Tumours within the Cranium—Severe headachs, continued or intermittent, with twitching of one or more of the extremities, pallid countenance, convul- sions, loss of memory, paralysis, epilepsy, coma, hydro- cephalus. Morbid An at. Scirrhous tubercles and encephaloid tu- mours are found in the form of round irregular masses, varying from the size of a pea to that of a hen’s egg, either of a greyish or reddish colour, and sometimes nodulated on the external surface. The nature of the tumour can be determined only by cutting into it; the interior is sometimes found softened, and contains some effused blood. The medullary matter surrounding the tumour is generally found softened. PLATE VIII. This Plate represents the encephaloid and scirrhous tumours, also depositions of calcareous and bony matters in the sub- stance of the cerebrum and cerebellum. Fig. 1. An encephaloid tumour at the posterior part of the medulla oblongata. Two are softened and have a flocculent appearance; they are adhering to the pia mater, covering the right lobe of the cerebellum, and receive their vessels from the same.

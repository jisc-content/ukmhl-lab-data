7 Morbid Anat. Between the pia mater and tunica arach- noides there often is to be observed a serous effusion, which in some bodies is * colourless, in others turbid, bloody, or even mixed with streaks of coagulable lymph. With respect to the substance of the brain, it is sometimes found unusually firm; and when cut into, the numerous points of blood show that the divided vessels are enlarged. A considerable quantity of serous fluid is also found in the ventricles. For the most part extravasated blood is met with in the cranium; sometimes between the membranes, some- times in the substance of the brain, and sometimes in the ventricles. PLATE VI. Fig. 1.

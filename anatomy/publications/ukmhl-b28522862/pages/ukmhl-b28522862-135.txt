23 gular, but rendered variable by the slightest move- ment of the body. Crepitation in the heart’s region: this symptom com- mences with the attack, and subsides in six or ten hours. Chronic Pericarditis—Dull obscure pain in the cardiac regions, with irregular pulse, palpitation, acute lancinating pains in the chest, sense of tightness, dyspnoea, anxious and pallid countenance, oedema of the lower extremities. Morbid Anat. Redness of the membranes, more or less deep, a concrete albuminous exhalation, and a sero- purulent effusion. * The redness is most generally but slight in the acute disease; when it exists it is for the most part only partially. It is commonly punctuated, and looks as if the sur- face of the membrane was covered with little specks of blood, very close to each other. In some cases, wherein, judging by the thickness of the false mem- branes, the inflammation appears to have been very great, no redness whatever can be discovered on the serous membrane on removal of this membranous exu- dation. This concrete albuminous exudation commonly in- vests the whole surface of the pericardium, as well on the heart and large vessels as on the sac. It rarely presents the appearance of an equable membranous layer, like the false membranes of pleurisy; on the contrary, its surface is most frequently marked by a great number of rough and irregular prominences. Symp. Inf \ of the Substance of the Heart—Violent palpi- tation and sense of oppression; at times anxious breath- ing, aggravated by exercise or any bodily motion; pulse full, sometimes weak and intermittent; bowels consti- pated, pain in some cases,'relieved in others, aggra- vated by the application of heat.

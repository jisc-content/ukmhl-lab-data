3 Fig. 2. Fibro-cartilaginous state of the cellular tissue be- tween the laminae of the dura mater. 3. Ossific depositions between the arachnoid and dura mater. 4. Fungoid tumours arising from the under surface of the dura mater. 5. Encephaloid tumour arising from the under surface of the tentorium cerebelli. Symp. of 2, 3, 4, and 5 are, long and continued headach, accompanied, at times, with the ordinary symptoms of epilepsy or apoplexy. Morbid Anat. Deposition of ossific matter is frequently found between the arachnoid membrane and dura mater; the patches of bone are generally small, scaly, and irregular in their shape; the falx cerebri and tentorium have been found completely ossified. Fungoid tumours are pulpy to the touch, and of a fibrous texture. In some points they become softened, and broken down, with blood effused into their sub- stance. The dura mater is also subject to ulceration, and some say gangrene. Scrofulous tumours are found adhering, and sometimes passing through the texture of this membrane; also small indurated fleshy tumours, of the size of peas, are met with. PLATE III. Represents inflammation of the pia mater, arachnoid mem- brane, and substance of the brain, and also softening of the cortical and medullary substance of the same organ. Fig. 1. Shows at one view inflammation of the arachnoid membrane, pia mater, and substance of the brain. a The arachnoid membrane thickened and opaque, and the convolutions of the brain imperfectly seen through it.

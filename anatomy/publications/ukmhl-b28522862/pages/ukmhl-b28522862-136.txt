24 Plate XXVI. Fig. ]. Several indurated pearly tubercles arising from the serous membrane of the heart. 2. Deposition of a cartilaginous matter into the cel- lular tissue, between the laminae of the pericar- dium reflected on the heart. 3. Ulceration of the reflected portion of pericardium and muscular substance of the heart. 4. A great many small cysts attached to the pericar- dium ; they contained a small quantity of limpid fluid of a faint straw colour. 5. Deposition of bony matter between the laminae of the pericardium reflected on the heart. Symp. of Ulcerationâ€”Palpitation, fatigued by the slightest exertion, pulse small but quick, constant weight and sense of burning in the regions of the heart. Morbid Anat. Ulceration of the heart is a very rare disease; I have seen but two cases in twenty years : the subjects were young women, disease asthma. The ulcer was situated in the muscular substance of the ventricle of the heart; it appeared of a dark colour, surrounded by an irregular edge, and bordered with an inflamed areola. One part of the surface of the ulcer had a tough cheese-like matter adhering to it. When first examined, the pericardium contains a quantity of blood- like serum, and very offensive. Plate XXVII. Fig. 1. Chronic inflammation of the serous membrane lining the cavity of the left ventricle, with thicken- ing, and a deposition of cartilaginous matter be- tween its laminae. 2. Recent effusion of imperfect lymph on the surface of the serous membrane lining the heart (chronic rheumatism).

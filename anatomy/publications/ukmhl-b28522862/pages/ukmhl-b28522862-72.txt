Morb. Anat. The eyeball, optic nerve, and in many cases the brain itself, are all involved in the disease. The morbid growth has, in almost every instance, the ap- pearance of medullary matter. It is chiefly composed of an opaque, whitish, homogeneous matter, having the same degree of pulpy softness and tenacity with the brain, mixed with a filamentous substance, resembling the cellular membrane^ PLATE XIII. Sketches of chronic inflammation of the fauces, enlarged, indurated, and ulcerated tonsils. Fig. 1. Chronic inflammation of the mucous tissue of the palate and fauces. 2. Enlarged and indurated tonsils. 3. Extensive ulceration of the tonsils, uvula, and mucous tissue of the fauces. Symp. Tickling in the throat, attended with great heat and a peppery taste in the mouth, cough, expectoration of mucus, sometimes blood; the tonsils are enlarged, and of a dark red colour. The uvula is soft and papulous, as if composed of a clot of blood. The capillary veins are distended, and the soft vascular network spread over the palate gives it the appearance of a well injected tissue of blood vessels. Morbid Anat. Cynanche malignaâ€”The fauces are in- flamed, suppurated, and gangrenous; and the trachea and larynx are likewise in a state of inflammation, and lined with a viscid fetid matter.

15 Fig. 5. Section of the thyroid gland, to show its cancillated structure. 6. Extensive ulceration of the mucous tissue of the larynx and trachea. Symp. Croup—Harsh, dry, metallic cough, dyspnoea, shrill voice, flushed face, veins of the head and neck turgid, and violent action of the muscles of the throat; asphyxia. Trachitis—Heat, pain, soreness in the trachea, dry- ness of the mucous tissue of the windpipe, followed by copious mucal expectoration, cough. Bronchocele—At first the swelling is without pain, but as the tumour increases in size it grows hard and irregular, the skin acquires a yellow colour, and the veins of the neck become varicose; flushing, headach, and lancinating pains in the tumours. Ulceration of the Larynx—Fixed pain in the seat of this organ, difficulty of breathing, and the patient can only speak in a whisper. Morb. Anat. In croup there is generally an exudation of lymph, which, becoming concrete at the very moment of its formation, lines the inner surface of the trachea to a greater or less extent. When this false mem- brane is removed, the subjacent tunic is found of a deep, vivid, red colour, occasionally livid and somewhat thickened. This colour is commonly uniform over the whole space covered by the false membrane, but is also fre- quently unequal, and occasionally altogether wanting. PLATE XVIII. This Plate represents the diseases of the bronchial membrane and tubes. Fig. 1. Extensive ulceration of the mucous tissue of the right bronchial tube.

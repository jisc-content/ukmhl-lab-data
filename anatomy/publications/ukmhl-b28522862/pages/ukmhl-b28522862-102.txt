18 PLATE XIX. This Plate represents emphysema and apoplexy of the lungs. Fig. 1. General emphysema of the lung. 2. Dried portion of the same lung. 3. Diffused apoplexy of the lung. 4. Circumscribed apoplexy of the lung. Symp. Emphysejna—Dyspnoea, wheezing inspiration, op- pression and stricture across the chest, cough, mucous expectoration, lassitude, torpor; pulse generally regular, lips violet-coloured, thick, and swollen. Apoplexy—Dyspnoea, cough, oppression at the chest, expectoration of a bright and frothy, or black and clotted blood, quite pure, or merely intermixed with saliva, or some bronchial or guttural mucus; pulse fre- quent, full, and vibrating under the finger. Morbid Anat. Emphysema—The pulmonary vesicles on the surface of the lungs are distended, their size varies from that of a millet seed to a nut; the partitions separating them are ruptured, hence the contained air is readily extravasated. The small bronchial ramifica- tions of the affected part are also dilated. Apoplexy—The lung is generally found gorged with dark venous blood ; when sliced, it presents an appear- ance similar to indurated liver, and the minute vessels and bronchial tubes are completely buried in the bloody mass. On the pleura pulmonalis are seen a great many ecchymose spots. Sometimes the blood is found diffused, sometimes circumscribed.

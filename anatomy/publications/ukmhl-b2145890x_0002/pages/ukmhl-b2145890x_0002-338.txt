320 HEAD AND NECK. orbital notch or foramen, it turns upwards on the fore- head (pp. 8 and 220). In the dissection of the scalp we have noted that this nerve divides into an outer and inner division. Sometimes this division takes place within the orbit, and in that case the outer larger part occupies the supra-orbital notch. The Lachrymal Nerve is the smallest of the terminal branches of the ophthalmic division of the fifth. It enters the orbit through the sphen- oidal fissure above the level of the muscles, and it proceeds forwards along the outer wall of the cavity, and above the upper margin of the external rectus muscle. At the fore part of the orbit it con- tinues its course under cover of the lachrymal gland until it reaches the outer part of the upper eyelid, in which it ends (p. 221). Within the orbital cavity it gives numerous twigs to the deep surface of the lachrymal gland, and it sends downwards a filament which connects it with the orbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve. Fourth Nerve.â€”This small nerve is destined entirely for the supply of the superior oblique muscle. Entering the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure above the muscles, it is continued forwards and inwards under the periosteum. It finally sinks into the upper or orbital surface of the superior oblique muscle not far from its origin. Lachrymal Gland.-The lachrymal 'gland is a

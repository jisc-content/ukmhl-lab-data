286 HEAD AND NECK. The pharyngeal tributariesjoin the internal jugular about the level of the hyoid bone. They come from a venous plexus which lies upon the side of the pharynx, and presents free communications above with the pterygoid plexus. The internal jugular vein should now be slit open. A short distance above its termination a single or a double flapped valve will be discovered. The vein should then be divided about two inches below its commencement and its upper part thrown upwards. This is done to enable the dissector to obtain a better view of the ninth cranial nerve emerging from the anterior condyloid foramen. Eighth Cranial Nerve.â€”The glossopharyngeal, the vagus or pneumo-gastric and the spinal accessory nerves, which constitute the three divisions of the eighth cranial nerve must, in the next place, be examined. They have, on a previous occasion, been seen leaving the cranial cavity through the middle compartment of the jugular fossa, in the interval between the commencement of the internal jugular vein behind and the inferior petrosal sinus in front (p. 31 and fig. 8-6 p. 35). It is well that the dissector should again examine the interior of the cranial cavity and refresh his memory as to the manner in which they enter this foramen. The glossopharyngeal occupies the foremost position, and it is cut off from the others by possessing a special and separate tube of dura mater. The spinal accessory is placed behind the vagus, and both are included within the same

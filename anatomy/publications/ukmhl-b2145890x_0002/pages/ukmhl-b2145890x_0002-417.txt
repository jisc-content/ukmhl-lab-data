NERVES AND VESSELS OF THE NASAL SEPTUM. 399 able, except in a fresh part; further, they are so soft that it is hardly possible to isolate them. They enter the nasal fossa through the inner series of apertures in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, and proceed downwards in grooves on the surface of the perpendicular plate of the same bone. Upon the deep surface of the mucous membrane they form a close meshed plexus of nerves. The naso-palatine nerve (nerve of Cotunnius) is a long slender twig which can easily be detected upon the deep surface of the mucous lining of the septum. It springs from Meckel's ganglion, and enters the nasal fossa through the spheno-palatine foramen. In the first part of its course it runs horizontally inwards upon the under surface of the body of the sphenoid. Having gained the nasal septum, it changes its direction and proceeds down- wards and forwards in a shallow groove on the surface of the vomer under cover of the mucous lining. Finally it enters the foramen of Scarpa, and where the two foramina of Scarpa open into the common anterior palatine canal, the nerves of opposite sides unite in a plexus from which branches are given to the mucous membrane covering the fore part of the hard palate. The naso-palatine nerve is accompanied by the corresponding artery, and as it lies on the surface of the vomer, it supplies some small twigs to the mucous membrane of the septum nasi. A few nasal branches from Meckel's ganglion, and also from the Vidian nerve, reach the mucous

DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 47 however, at the present stage. The auricular branches supply the integument upon the cranial aspect of the auricle, and if they be carefully dissected, several of them will be noticed to pierce the cartilage to reach the integument on its outer surface. Communications may also be made out between these twigs and the posterior auricular branch of the facial nerve. The mastoid branch extends upwards upon the mastoid process, where it is connected with the posterior auricular and small occipital nerves. Posterior Triangle of the Neck.—Whilst the subject is lying upon its face we can only obtain a very meagre idea of this triangle—indeed, it is only its upper and least important part which can be exposed. To bring the boundaries, floor and contents, of this portion into view, the dissector should begin by cleaning the cervical portion of the trapezius. Occupying the interval between the trapezius and sterno-mastoid, two other contiguous muscles taking a somewhat oblique course, will be observed. The higher of these is the splenius capitis, and the lower is the levator anguli scapulae. These, together with the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, must be cleaned. In carrying out this dissection the dissector must proceed with some degree of caution ; and above all he must be careful not to raise the sterno-mastoid nor disturb the cervical nerves which lie under cover of it, because these can be studied to much greater advantage when the subject is turned. Further, the small lymphatic glands termed the glandules conca-

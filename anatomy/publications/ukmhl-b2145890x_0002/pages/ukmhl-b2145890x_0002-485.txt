NERVES AND VESSELS OE THE TONGUE. 467 face of the septum linguae, to reach the dorsum and side of the tongue. The fibres of genio-hyo-glossus ascend through the stratum transversum and break it up into numerous lamellae (Fig. 56 d). It is joined by the fibres of the palato-glossus (Henle), (Fig. 55). The vertical muscular fibres (stratum perpendiculare) extend in a curved direction from the dorsum to the under aspect of the tongue, and decussate with the fibres of the stratum transversum. c - Fig. 57.

These should be traced on the left side of the tongue, where the mucous membrane is still in position. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve has been traced up to the point where it disappears under cover of the hyo- glossus muscle. Here it divides into two branches.

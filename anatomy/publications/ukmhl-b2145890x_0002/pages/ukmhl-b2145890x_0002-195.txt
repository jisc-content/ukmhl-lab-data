COMMON CAROTID ARTERY. 177 The three veins cross the common carotid from within outwards, and at different levelsâ€”viz., the superior thyroid near its bifurcation, the middle thyroid below the level of the cricoid cartilage, and the anterior jugular at the root of the neck ; whilst, however, the thyroid veins are in immediate relation to the vessel, the anterior jugular is separated from it by the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles. The stemo- mastoid artery, a branch of the superior thyroid, crosses the vessel as it lies within the carotid triangle. The descendens noni proceeds downwards and inwards upon the vessel, and frequently within its sheath. The ansa hypoglossi is formed upon the anterior aspect of the carotid sheath by the union of the descendens noni with the communi- cantes noni. Behind, the vessel is in apposition with the longus colli and the rectus capitis anticus major muscles. These intervene between it and the cervical vertebrse. The gangliated cord of the sympathetic, the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and the inferior thyroid artery are also related to it posteriorly. The sympathetic cord descends vertically behind the artery, and is inter- posed between its sheath and the prevertebral muscles; the recurrent laryngeal is carried upwards and inwards behind the lower part of the vessel; the inferior thyroid artery crosses behind the carotid sheath about the level of the sixth cental vertebra. To the outer side of the common carotid artery lie the pneumogastric nerve and the internal jugular PART III. , * fa

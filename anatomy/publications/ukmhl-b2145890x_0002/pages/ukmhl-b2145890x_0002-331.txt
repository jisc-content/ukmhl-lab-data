CAROTID AND CAVERNOUS PLEXUSES. 3X3 Carotid and Cavernous Plexuses.—The sym- pathetic filaments which form these plexuses can only be satisfactorily dissected in a subject which has not been injected, and even then, the dissection is an exceedingly difficult one. The carotid plexus is the name eiven to a fine nerve-meshwork upon the outer side of the internal carotid artery at the point where it enters the cranium. It supplies filaments to the inner part of the Gasserian ganglion and to the sixth nerve. The cavernous plexus is placed in the cavern- ous sinus upon the lower and inner aspect of the same vessel, at the point where it makes its final bend upwards. It supplies filaments to the pituitary body, to the third and fourth nerves, and to the ophthalmic division of the fifth, and likewise the sympathetic root to the lenticular or ophthalmic ganglion. Great Superficial Petrosal Nerve.—This minute nerve, along with a small arterial twig from the middle meningeal artery, can readily be exposed in the groove on the anterior face of the petrous bone which leads outwards to the hiatus Fallopii. It is placed under cover of the Gasserian ganglion, which must therefore be turned forwards and outwards. Entering the hiatus Fallopii, the great superficial petrosal nerve is conducted to the aqueduct of Fallopius, where it joins the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. If traced in the opposite direction, it will be found at the posterior aspect of the body of the sphenoid bone

INTERIOR OF THE LARYNX. 433 or recess which is termed the laryngeal shuts. The dissector should endeavour to gauge the extent of this, by means of a probe bent at the extremity. He will note that it passes upwards, so as to undermine somewhat the superior vocal cord, and that its mouth or orifice is narrower than its cavity. Under cover of the fore part of the false vocal cord, an elongated aperture will be detected. This leads into the laryn- geal pouch or sacâ€”a small mucous diverticulum, which ascends between the false vocal cord and the ala of the thyroid cartilage. This sac is of variable extent, but as a rule it ends blindly at the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. Distend the sinus, and if possible the sac, with cotton wadding. This will greatly facilitate the subsequent dissection. The Lower Subdivision of the Laryngeal Cavity (Fig. 48, C) leads directly downwards into the trachea. Above it is narrow and laterally compressed, but it gradually widens out until in its lowest part it is circular. It is bounded by the lower part of the thyroid cartilage, the crico-thyroid mem- brane, and the cricoid cartilage. It is through the anterior wall of this compartment, that the opening is made in the operation of laryngotomy. The Mucous Membrane of the larynx is continuous above with that lining the pharynx, and below with the' mucous lining of the trachea. Over the epiglottis and true vocal cord it is very tightly part in. 2 F

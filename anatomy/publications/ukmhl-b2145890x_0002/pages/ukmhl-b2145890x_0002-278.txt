260 HEAD AND NECK. maxillary nerve enter into its composition. A few motor fibres, however, are also prolonged into it; these come off from it in two branches—viz., (i.) in the nerve to the external pterygoid, which as a rule arises in common with the long buccal and at once sinks into the deep surface of this muscle ; and (2.) in a third twig of supply to the temporal muscle. This temporal branch springs from the long buccal after it has reached the outer surface of the external ptery- goid, and proceeds upwards to supply the fore part of the temporal muscle. In some cases the long buccal nerve may be observed to pierce the temporal muscle instead of passing under cover of it. The Auriculo-Temporal Nerve, composed of sensory fibres, springs from the posterior division of the inferior maxillary by two roots. These pass backwards under cover of the external pterygoid muscle and embrace the middle meningeal artery. Beyond this vessel they unite, and the nerve is con- tinued backwards under cover of the neck of the lower jaw, immediately below the temporo-maxillary joint. Gaining the interval between the ear and jaw it turns upwards in relation to the deep surface of the parotid gland, and crosses the zygoma in company with the superficial temporal artery. Its further course has already been examined, pp. 9, 200. The following branches proceed from it:—(1.) one or two strong branches of communication to the temporo- facial nerve ; (2.) a few slender filaments which enter the posterior aspect of the temporo-maxillary joint;

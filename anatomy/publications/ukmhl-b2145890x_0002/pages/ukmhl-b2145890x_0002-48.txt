,4 HEAD AND NECK. Occipital Sinus-Fig. 8 (S.).-This is a minute blood channel, which is placed between the layers of the falx cerebelli. Above (as a rule) it opens into the torcular Herophili, whilst below, at the foramen mag- num, it bifurcates, and the two divisions thus formed not unfrequently run forwards to join the lower end of the lateral sinus upon either side. Sometimes the occipital sinus is double throughout its whole course, and not merely at its lower extremity. The Lateral Sinuses-Fig. 8 (Sfr^-are two in number_one on each side. They are very variable in their mode of origin, but as we have noted, the right lateral sinus is commonly formed by the superior longitudinal sinus, whilst the left is formed by the straight sinus. They commence one upon either side of the internal occipital protuberance, and communi- cate with each other by a transverse channel of variable width, which passes in front of this bony Pâ€”1* The sinus which represents the continuation of the superior longitudinal sinus is generally much larger than the other. From the occipital protuberance, each lateral sinus passes at first horizontally outwards and grooves the occipital bone and the inferior angle of the parietal bone along the attached border of the tentorium. Reaching the temporal bone, it is joined by the superior petrosal sinus, and then suddenly curves downwards and inwards, in the deep furrow upon the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and the jugular process of the occipital bone. Lastly, it turns forwards and disappears into the posterior compart-

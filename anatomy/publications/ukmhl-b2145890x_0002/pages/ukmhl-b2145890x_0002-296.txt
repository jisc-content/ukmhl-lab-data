278 HEAD AND NECK. DEEP DISSECTION OF THE NECK. In the deep dissection of the neck the following structures are displayed :â€” (i.) The styloid process, with the three muscles which take origin from it. (2.) The internal carotid artery. (3.) The ascending pharyngeal artery. (4.) The tonsillitic and ascending palatine branches of the facial artery. (5.) The internal jugular vein. ( Glosso-pharyngeal. (6.) The three divisions of the J Vagus> eighth cranial nerve, . [ gpinal accesSory. (7.) The ninth, or hypoglossal, nerve. (8.) The cervical part of the sympathetic cord. (9.) The first loop of the cervical plexus. (10.) The rectus lateralis muscle. Before the dissection is commenced, the skull-cap, which, up to the present time, has been retained in position by the flaps of scalp stitched over it, should be removed. The floor of the cranium should then be cleansed by sponging it with spirit and carbolic solution. To expose the styloid process and its muscles it is necessary to turn aside the posterior belly of the digastric, and the external carotid artery. Detach the former from its origin, and throw it down- wards and forwards towards the hyoid bone. Its nerve of supply from the facial must also be cut, and if the filament which connects this branch with the

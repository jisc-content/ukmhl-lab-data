SUPERIOR DENTAL NERVES. 391 dental foramina to supply the three molar teeth and the lining membrane of the antrum of Highmore. The middle superior denial nerve supplies the two bicuspid teeth. It arises from the infra-orbital nerve, a short distance in front of the spheno-maxillary fossa, and can be easily detected (when present) by gently raising the parent trunk from the floor of the canal.

It descends in a minute canal which traverses the outer wall of the antrum of Highmore. The anterior superior dental nerve, much the largest of the three dental branches, springs from the infra- orbital as it approaches the fore part of the canal. It can be brought into view by raising the parent trunk from the floor' of the canal, and it will then be seen to enter a special bony tunnel which traverses the upper

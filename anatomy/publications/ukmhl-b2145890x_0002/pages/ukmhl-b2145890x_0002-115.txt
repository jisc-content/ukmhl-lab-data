SIDE OF THE NECK. 99 Surface Markings.—Certain important landmarks must be recognised before the skin is reflected from this region. The sterno-mastoid muscle, pursuing a diagonal course through the space from its antero- inferior to its postero-superior angle, is, perhaps, the most essential of these. By drawing the head well over to the opposite side, it will be rendered very evident. The region in front of the sterno-mastoid corresponds to the anterior triangle of the neck; that behind it constitutes the posterior triangle. Above the notch of the manubrium sterni, a deep fossa in the middle line and between the tendons of the two sterno- mastoid muscles, must next be noted. Subjacent to this fossa lies the trachea, but it is rare indeed, and only in emaciated individuals, that the rings of this tube can be felt from the surface. In its upper part the trachea is always obscured by the isthmus of the thyroid body which crosses it. The dissector should now run his finger upwards in the middle line of the neck. Beyond the trachea he will come upon the ring-like cricoid cartilage. This is a highly important landmark. With it as his guide, the surgeon is able to mark out the points at which the trachea or larynx may be opened, and also the level at which the common carotid artery is most favour- ably placed for the application of a ligature. Above the cricoid cartilage the finger enters the narrow interval between the cricoid and thyroid cartilages—a gap which is occupied by the crico-thyroid membrane. It is in this interval that the operation of laryngotomy is performed. Next comes the thyroid cartilage with

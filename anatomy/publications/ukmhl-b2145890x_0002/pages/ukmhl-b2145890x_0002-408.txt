The temporo-malar nerve, which has already been dissected in the orbit, can now be traced back to its origin from the superior maxillary nerve in the s'ftfieno-maxillary fossa. The spheno-palatine branches are two stout twigs which arise from the under aspect of the superior maxillary nerve, and proceed vertically downwards in the spheno-maxillary fossa to Meckel's ganglion, of which they constitute the sensory roots. Superior Dental Nerves.—These are usually three in number, and are distinguished as posterior, middle, and anterior. The middle superior dental nerve is sometimes absent as a separate trunk, in which case it arises in common with the anterior superior dental. The posterior superior dental nerve takes origin in the spheno-maxillary fossa, and almost immediately divides into two branches, which proceed downwards upon the posterior aspect of the body of the superior maxillary bone. They contribute a few fine filaments to the mucous membrane of the cheek and to the gum, and then disappear into the minute posterior

200 HEAD AND NECK. Finally, at a point corresponding with the second molar tooth of the upper jaw, it opens into the mouth by a minute orifice placed on the summit of a small papilla. In length, the duct measures about two inches, and its course may be marked out on the surface of the cheek by drawing a line from the lower part of the external auditory meatus of the auricle to a point midway between the nostrils and the margin of the red part of the lip. The dissector should now open the duct, and pass a fine probe through it into the mouth. The calibre of the tube will then be observed to be greatly reduced at its opening upon the inner aspect of the cheek. Evert the cheek, and examine this orifice. Deep Relations of Parotid Gland.â€”The parotid gland may now be removed piece-meal by following the facial nerves and the transverse facial artery into its substance (p. 197). The dissector will see how deeply the parotid gland passes inwards, and how intricate are its connections. The styloid process, with the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscles arising from it, the internal jugular vein, the three divisions of the eighth cranial nerve, and the hypo- glossal nerve, are all in close relation to its deep surface, whilst, not far off, is the internal carotid artery. Behind and below, it is in contact with the posterior belly of the digastric and the posterior auricular artery Further, a portion of gland substance will be seen occupying the back part of the glenoid fossa, whilst another portion stretches forwards for a short

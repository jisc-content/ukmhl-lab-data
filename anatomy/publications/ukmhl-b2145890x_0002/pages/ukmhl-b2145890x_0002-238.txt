220 HEAD AND NECK. buccinator muscle, and forms, with the long buccal branch of the inferior maxillary division of the fifth nerve, a plexus around the facial vein. The supra-maxillary branch proceeds forwards upon the lower jaw to reach the muscles in connection with the lower lip. Under cover of the depressor anguli oris it communicates with the mental branch of the inferior dental nerve. The infra-maxillary branch has already been examined in the dissection of the neck (p. 107). Sensory Branches to the Face from the Fifth Nerve.—The branches which come from the ophthal- mic division of the fifth nerve may first be studied. Of these two go to the skin of the forehead and scalp—viz., the supra-orbital and the supra-trochlear ; two, to the eyelids—viz, the palpebral branch of the lachrymal and the infra-trochlear ; and one, the nasal, to the skin of the nose. The supra - orbital and the supra - trochlear have already been dissected in the scalp (p. 6). They should now be followed downwards to the point where they turn round the orbital arch of the frontal bone. This can be done by cutting through the frontal belly of the occipito-frontalis and the orbicu- laris palpebrarum under cover of which they pass upwards. The supra-orbital quits the orbit by the supra-orbital notch or foramen, and the supra- trochlear at a point internal to this. Both nerves give twigs downwards to the skin and conjunctiva of the upper eyelid.

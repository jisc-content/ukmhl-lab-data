The dura mater is then to be raised, and the greatest care must be taken in doing so, because it is intimately connected with the nerves which lie subjacent to it. Thus, where it forms the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, it is closely applied to the third and fourth nerves, and firmly attached to the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve, whilst over the petrous bone it is united to the surface of the Gasserian ganglion. The edge of the knife, therefore, must be kept close to the membrane, and a small portion of it may be left upon the nerves. This can afterwards be removed as the nerves are defined. Cavernous Sinus—(Fig. 8, Sc, p. 35)-—The cavernous sinus has been opened by the above dissection. It is a short, wide venous channel, which extends upon the side of the body of the sphenoid bone, from the lower and inner end of the sphenoidal fissure backwards to the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. In front, blood is conducted into it by the ophthalmic veins and the spheno- parietal venous sinus (v. p. 37)> whilst behind, the blood is drained away by the superior and inferior petrosal venous sinuses (v. p. 36). But it has still other connections ; thus, it receives some of the inferior cerebral veins, and internally it is brought into communication with the corresponding sinus of the opposite side by means of the circular sinus (p. 36). Lastly, one or more minute emissary veins leave its

OPTIC NERVE. 325 the superior division of the third nerve is brought into view, and will be seen to sink into its deep or ocular surface, and at the same time send a twig to the levator palpebral superioris. The removal of some fat will bring the optic nerve more fully into view, and at the back part of the orbit three structures will be observed crossing it—viz., (1.) the nasal nerve; (2.) the ophthalmic artery; and (3.) the superior ophthalmic vein. These should be care- fully cleaned and their branches followed out. From the nasal nerve, one or two delicate thread- like branches — the long ciliary nerves — will be found passing forwards along the optic nerve to reach the eyeball. The short ciliary nerves, much more numerous, accompany the long ciliary branches, and can readily be disengaged from the fat which surrounds the optic nerve. A strong member of this group should be selected and followed backwards ; it will lead the dissector to the lenticular or ophthal- mic ganglion. This is a minute body which is situated upon the outer side of the optic nerve far back in the orbit. With a little patience and care the roots which the nasal nerve and inferior division of the third nerve give to this ganglion, can be isolated, and perhaps even the sympathetic root may be found. Optic Nerve.—The optic nerve enters the orbit through the optic foramen. It carries with it a strong loose sheath of dura mater, and also a more delicate investment from the arachnoid. The ophthalmic

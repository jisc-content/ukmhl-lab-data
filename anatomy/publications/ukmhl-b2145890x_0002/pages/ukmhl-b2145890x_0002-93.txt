DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 77 pushed for time, it is better that he should proceed to expose the spinal cord, and defer the dissection of the sub-occipital region until the head and neck has been removed from the body. The sub-occipital space is a small triangular area, exposed by the reflection of the complexus muscle. It is bounded by three muscles—viz. (i.) the rectus capitis posticus major, which forms its- upper and inner boundary; (2.) the obliquus inferior, which limits it below ; and (3.) the obliquus superior, which bounds it above and to the outer side. When dis- sected, its floor will be found to consist of two structures—viz., the posterior arch of the atlas and the thin posterior occipito-atlantal ligament, whilst it contains within its area a portion of the vertebral artery and the posterior primary division of the sub- occipital or first cervical nerve. Before cleaning the bounding muscles the sub- occipital nerve must be secured. This can best be done by tracing into the space the minute twig which it has been seen to give to the deep surface of the complexus, or if this has not been observed, by endeavouring to find the twig which it gives to the rectus capitis posticus major. The tissue in which the nerve lies is very dense, and the dissection in consequence is rendered somewhat difficult. Rectus Capitis Posticus Major.—This muscle springs by a pointed origin from the spine of the axis, and, expanding as it passes upwards and outwards, is inserted into the occipital bone along the outer portion

326 HEAD AND NECK. artery which accompanies it, lies in relation to its outer and lower aspect Within the orbit the nerve inclines forwards and outwards, and at the same time somewhat downwards, and gaining the back of the eyeball, it pierces the sclerotic a short distance to the inner side of its centre. As the dissector has already observed, its upper surface is crossed by the ophthal- mic artery and vein and the nasal nerve, and it is closely accompanied by the delicate ciliary nerves and vessels. The distance which the optic nerve has to run from the optic foramen to the globe of the eye is about one inch. Within the eyeball, it spreads out in the retina. Nasal Nerve.—The nasal nerve arises in the fore part of the cavernous sinus from the ophthalmic division of the fifth. It passes through the sphen- oidal fissure and enters the orbital cavity between the two heads of the external rectus muscle, and between the two divisions of the third nerve. It now inclines forwards and inwards, and, crossing the optic nerve obliquely, it runs between the internal rectus and superior oblique muscle. Here it reaches the inner wall of the orbit, and ends by dividing into two terminal branches—viz., the infra-trochlear and the nasal proper. In addition to these it gives off in the orbit the following branches:— (i.) Long root to the lenticular ganglion. (2.) Long ciliary nerves. The long ganglionic root is a very slender filament

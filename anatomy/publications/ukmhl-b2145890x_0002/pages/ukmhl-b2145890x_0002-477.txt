459 THE TONGUE. by the elasticity of the ligaments. The thyroary- tenoid muscles must be regarded as antagonistic to the crico-thyroid muscles. When they contract, they draw forward the arytenoid cartilages and posterior lamina of the cricoid cartilage, and still further relax the cords, and when they cease to act, the elastic ligaments again bring about a state of equilibrium. The ary-vocales muscles, by the insertion of their fibres into the true vocal cords, may tighten portions of the cords, and, at the same time, relax the parts behind. The width of the rima glottidis is affected by the arytenoideus, which approximates the arytenoid cartil- ages and by the crico-arytenoidei laterales and postici. The crico-arytenoidei postici, by drawing the muscu- lar processes of the arytenoid cartilages outwards and backwards, swing the processus vocales and the vocal cords outwards, and thus open the rima. The crico-arytenoidei laterales are antagonistic muscles, and by drawing the muscular processes in an opposite direction, close the rima. The thyro-ary-epiglottidean muscle acts as a sphincter of the superior laryngeal aperture. THE TONGUE. The tongue is a muscular organ placed on the floor of the mouth. It has important duties to perform in connection with the functions of mastication, deglutition, and articulation. Moreover, the mucous membrane which covers it is specially modified in

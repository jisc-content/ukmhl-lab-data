DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 55 The aponeurosis may thus be raised from the sub- jacent erector spinas, and its connections made out. Mesially it will be seen to have a strong attachment to the tips of the lumbar spines and the intervening supra-spinous ligaments; inferiorly it is fixed to the back part of the crest of the ilium, and to the sub- jacent tendon of the erector spinae, where this lies upon the dorsum of the sacrum. Fascia transversalis. External oblique. Internal oblique. Transversalis. Latissimus dorsi. Serratus post. inf. Fig. 11. Diagram to show the connections of the lumbar fascia. The erector spinae should now be pushed inwards either with the fingers or with the handle of a knife. This proceeding will bring into view the second or middle lamella of the lumbar fascia. Further, the union of the posterior and middle lamellae, beyond the outer border of the erector spinae and the attachment of the middle lamella to the tips of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, may be

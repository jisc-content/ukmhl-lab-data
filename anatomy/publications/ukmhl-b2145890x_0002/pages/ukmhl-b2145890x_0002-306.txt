288 HEAD AND NECK. pharyngeus muscle and at the lower border of the latter, it hooks round the muscle and then curves forwards upon its superficial surface to gain the base of the tongue. In the dissection of the submaxillary region, its terminal part was seen disappearing under cover of the posterior border of the hyo-glossus muscle ; here it ends in lingual branches. In the present dissection the following branches should be made out:— (i.) Communicating branch (3.) Pharyngeal. from the facial. (4>) Tonsillitic. (2.) Nerve to the stylo- pharyngeus. The communicating branch from the facial is a small butimportant twig. It springs from the nerve to the posterior belly of the digastric, and, as a rule, emerges from midst the fibres of this muscle to join the glosso-pharyngeal close to the lower part of the jugular foramen. By some anatomists this branch is considered to convey to the glosso-pharyngeal the motor fibres which it supplies to the stylo-pharyngeus muscle. The stylo-pharyngeal nerve is a small twig which enters the muscle of the same name. The greater part of its fibres, however, are continued through the muscle to the mucous membrane of the pharynx. The pharyngeal branches consist—(1.) of one or two small twigs which perforate the superior constrictor to reach the mucous membrane of the pharynx; and (2.) a larger nerve which comes off higher up and

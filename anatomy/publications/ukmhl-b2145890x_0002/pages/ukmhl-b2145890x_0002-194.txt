176 HEAD AND NECK. close together, the trachea and oesophagus alone inter- vening, but as they proceed upwards they diverge slightly from each other, and where they end they are separated by the entire width of the thyroid cartilage and the pharynx. Together with the internal jugular vein, the pneumogastric nerve, and frequently the descendens noni nerve, the vessel is enveloped by a strongly- marked sheath derived from the cervical fascia. This has been removed, but its constitution, and the relation which its contents bear to each other within it, have been already observed (pp. m, 13 5)- The common carotid artery is very differently circumstanced in regard to the surface in its lower and upper parts. Opposite the cricoid cartilage it is crossed by the omo-hyoid, and below this it is placed very deeply, being covered by the integument, platysma, and deep fascia, and by three muscular strata—viz., sterno-mastoid, the sterno-hyoid, and the sterno-thyroid. * . Above the level of the omo-hyoid muscle it lies within the limits of the carotid triangle, and is there- fore placed nearer the surface. Here it is simply overlapped by the anterior margin of the sterno- mastoid, and covered by the platysma, fasciae, and integument. The vessels and nerves in relation to its anterior surface are — (1.) Superior thyroid vein. (2.) Middle thyroid vein. (3.) Anterior jugular vein. (4.) Sterno-mastoid artery. (5.) Descendens noni nerve and the ansa hypo- glossi.

HEAD AND NECK. 312 Internal Carotid Artery.—The intra-cranial portion of the internal carotid artery may now be examined. It lies upon the lateral aspect of the body of the sphenoid, and for the greater part of its course it traverses the floor of the cavernous sinus. It enters the cranium by emerging from the carotid canal at the apex of the petrous bone, and it first ascends vertically until it reaches the root of the posterior clinoid process ; here it makes a bend and is prolonged forwards to the inner aspect of the anterior clinoid process where it abruptly turns upwards and pierces the dura mater immediately behind the entrance of the optic nerve into the optic foramen. At this point it has been severed in the removal of the brain, but it will be afterwards seen to end at the commencement of the Sylvian fissure of the brain, by dividing into the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Throughout its whole course it is surrounded by sympathetic filaments, and soon after its entrance into the cranium, the sixth nerve winds round its outer side. The intra-cranial portion of the internal carotid artery gives off the following branches :— \ These are min- (i.) Branches to the pituitary body, ) tg twigg whkh (2.) Branches to the Gasserian ganglion, V.^ in the (3.) Branches to the dura mater, ) cavernous sjnus. (4.) Ophthalmic, \ (5.) Posterior communicating, ( These will be studied (6.) Anterior cerebral, ) terminal fat a later stage. (7.) Middle cerebral, j branches. J

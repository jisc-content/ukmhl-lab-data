192 HEAD AND NECK. The appendages of the eye. The muscles of expression. The parotid gland and its duct. ((a.) Facial artery and its branches. (b.) Twigs from the ophthalmic and internal maxillary arteries. (c.) Transverse facial artery. Vessels,/ (d.) External carotid dividing into superficial temporal and internal maxillary arteries. (e.) Facial and angular veins. (/) Temporo-maxillary vein. ((a) Facial branch of the great auricular. 5. Nerves,\ \b.) Facial nerve. \(c.) Sensory branches from the fifth nerve. 6. The cartilages of the nose. 7. The external auricle. The dissection of the face is both difficult and tedious. The ramifications of the nerves are so intricate, and the fibres of the facial muscles are so pale and so closely surrounded by the soft subcutane- ous fat of the region that great care and patience are required on the part of the student to obtain a proper display of the various structures. In cases where the dissection is undertaken for the first time, it may be well to devote particular attention to the nerves and muscles on the one side and to the vessels and muscles on the opposite side. At the same time it must be clearly understood that a good dissector should be able to make a complete dissection upon both sides.

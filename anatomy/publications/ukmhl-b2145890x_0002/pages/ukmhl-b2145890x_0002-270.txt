252 HEAD AND NECK. artery accompanies the long buccal nerve, and is distributed to the outer surface of the buccinator muscle. It anastomoses with the facial artery. The posterior dental branch of the third part of the internal maxillary artery descends upon the posterior aspect of the superior maxilla, and sends branches through the posterior dental foramina for the supply of the upper molar and bicuspid teeth. Some small twigs also go to the gum, whilst others find their way to the lining membrane of the antrum of Highmore. Pterygoid and Internal Maxillary Veins.â€”The veins in this region are very numerous, but they cannot be studied satisfactorily in an ordinary dissection. They are well seen, however, when injected, in horizontal sections of the frozen head made at the level of the external pterygoid muscle. They constitute a dense plexus, termed the pterygoidplexus around the external pterygoid muscle. Tributaries corresponding to the branches of the internal maxillary artery, open into this network, whilst the blood is led away from its back part by a short wide trunk, called the internal maxillary vein. This vessel accompanies the first part of the internal maxillary artery into the parotid gland, and joins the superficial temporal vein, behind the neck of the jaw, to form the temporo-maxillary trunk. The pterygoid venous plexus also establishes by various offsets, certain highly important connections. From its fore part the deep facial vein proceeds ; this extends forwards under cover of the lower jaw, and

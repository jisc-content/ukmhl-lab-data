256 HEAD AND NECK. will likewise be found proceeding downwards and forwards to join the lingual nerve, and the middle meningeal, tympanic, and small meningeal arteries may be traced to the points where they leave the space. Middle and Small Meningeal and Tympanic Arteries.—The middle meningeal artery has already been seen arising from the first part of the internal maxillary artery. It proceeds upwards under cover of the external pterygoid muscle, and disappears from view by entering the foramen spinosum, and thus gaining the cranial cavity (p. 38). It will generally be observed to be embraced by the two heads of origin of the auriculo-temporal nerve. The small meningeal and tympanic arteries arise more frequently from the preceding vessel than from the trunk of the internal maxillary. The small meningeal inclines forwards and upwards, and enters the cranial cavity by passing through the foramen ovale ; the tympanic runs upwards and slightly back- wards, and reaches the tympanum by passing through the Glasserian fissure. In the tympanic cavity it anastomoses with the stylo-mastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery. Inferior Maxillary Division of the Fifth Cranial Nerve.—The inferior maxillary nerve springs from the Gasserian ganglion, and enters the pterygo- maxillary region through the foramen ovale. It is composed of sensory fibres, but it is accompanied

THE SUPERFICIAL TEMPORAL ARTERY. 203 The internal maxillary artery at once passes for- wards under cover of the neck of the jaw and disappears from view. The superficial temporal artery- may now be fully followed out. The Superficial Temporal Artery appears to be the direct continuation upwards of the external carotid artery. At first in the substance of the parotid it soon emerges from this, and crossing the root of the zygoma, ascends upon the temporal fascia for a distance of about two inches, and then divides into its two terminal branches, the anterior and posterior superficial temporal arteries. These are described in p. 11. The superficial temporal artery is closely accompanied by the auriculo-temporal nerve, and the superficial temporal vein. In addition to its terminal branches it gives offâ€” 1. Parotid twigs. 3. Transverse facial. 2. Anterior auricular 4. Middle temporal. branches. 5. Orbital. The anterior auricular branches supply the anterior aspect of the external auricle and anastomose with the posterior auricular artery. The transverse facial is given off in the substance of the parotid. It runs transversely forwards through the gland, and emerging from its anterior border, proceeds onwards across the masseter to end in twigs which anastomose with branches of the facial, buccal and infra-orbital arteries. Whilst it lies on the masseter muscle it is in relation to the upper border of the parotid duct.

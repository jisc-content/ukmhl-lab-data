9 SCALP. The temporal branch of the orbital nerve is a minute twig, which is somewhat difficult to find. It pierces the temporal fascia about one inch above the anterior part of the zygoma, and the dissector is frequently led to it by a communicating twig from one of the facial branches. It is distributed to a limited area of skin in this region. The auriculo-temporal nerve will be found immedi- ately in front of the ear, in close contact with the superficial temporal artery. It soon divides into two branches, which diverge from each other as they ascend, and a careful dissector may be able to trace twigs from these as far as the summit of the head. Its branches terminate in the skin of the scalp. In the mastoid and occipital regions of the scalp, the dissector will meet with four nerves, each from a different source ; (a.) the posterior auricular branch of the facial nerve—Fig. I (3) ; (J?.) the mastoid branch of the great auricular nerve ; (c.) the small occipital nerve frnrn. the, anterior primary (jivision of the second cervical nerve—Fig. 1 (8) ; and (d.) the great occipital nerve from the posterior primary division of the second cervical nerve—Fig. 1 (4). The posterior auricular is a small nerve which ascends upon the front of the mastoid process, imme- diately behind the ear ; and the guide to it is the posterior auricular artery, which lies in contact with it. After effecting a communication with the great auricular nerve, it divides into an auricular and an occipital division. The auricular division continues its upward course, and ends by supplying the retra-

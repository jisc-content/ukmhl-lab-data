THE THYROID CARTILAGE. 45 I contact with its anterior surface presses it down- wards over the laryngeal aperture like a lid or a valve. As soon as the bolus has passed beyond this point the epiglottis springs up into its former position by reason of its own elasticity and that of its ligaments. But the process is facilitated by the ascent of the thyroid cartilage during deglutition : this renders the epiglottidean ligaments lax, and permits the more easy folding downwards of the cartilage. Again the descent of the thyroid cartilage after this stage of deglutition is completed, stretches the elastic epiglottidean ligaments and erects the epiglottis. The Thyroid is the largest of the laryngeal cartilages. It is composed of two broad somewhat quadrilateral plates, termed the alee, which meet in front at an acute angle and constitute the projection in the neck known as the pomum Adami. This is more prominent in its upper part than below,'and is always more marked in the male than in the female. From the pomum Adami the two alae diverge back-' wards and outwards, like the limbs of the letter V, so as to enclose between them the posterior lamina of the cricoid cartilage and the arytenoid cartilages. The upper border of each ala is somewhat convex, but in front it is cut away or bevelled off so that with the corresponding part of the opposite ala a deep median notch is formed. This is called the incisura thyroidea. The lower border is nearly straight, but is subdivided by a slight tubercle into an anterior and a posterior concave part. The posterior border is

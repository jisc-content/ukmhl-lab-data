Pharyngeal branch of (2.) Stylo-pharyngeus. vagus. (3.) Glosso-pharyngeal (5.) A portion of the parotid nerve. gland. Behind, the internal carotid rests upon the rectus capitis anticus major muscle, and is in contact with the pneumogastric nerve and the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. To its outer side is the internal jugular vein ; and a prolongation upwards of the carotid sheath encloses the two vessels together with the pneumogastric nerve. On its inner aspect the internal carotid is related to the pharynx and the tonsil. At the same time it should be noted that the relationship to the tonsil is not so close as has generally been supposed. This has been pointed out by Braune, and will be seen in Fig. 28, which represents a section through the frozen head at the level of the upper part of the tonsil. Before leaving this vessel, note that at the base of the skull four nerves appear in the interval between it and the internal jugular vein j these are the glosso- pharyngeal, the pneumogastric, the hypoglossal, and the spinal accessory. Ascending Pharyngeal Artery.—The origin of this vessel from the external carotid has already been observed (p. 188). It proceeds vertically upwards to

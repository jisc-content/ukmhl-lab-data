296 HEAD AND NECK. traced down the stem of the vagus into the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The spinal part of the spinal accessory is directed backwards under the transverse process of the atlas. It crosses the internal jugular vein, and disappears into the substance of the sterno-mastoid muscle. Its further course has been already studied (pp. 138 and 117). It is distributed to two muscles—viz., the sterno-mastoid and the trapezius. Pharyngeal Plexus—This is a meshwork of fine nerve filaments, which is formed upon the lateral wall of the pharynx at the level of the middle constrictor muscle. The pharyngeal branches of the vagus, glosso-pharyngeal, and superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic enter into its construction, and one or more minute ganglia are developed in connection with it. Its terminal twigs are given to the muscles and mucous membrane of the pharynx, and one branch (the ramus lingualis vagi) connects the plexus with the hypoglossal nerve. The Hypoglossal Nerve has already been studied in the dissection of the anterior triangle, in which it appears by emerging from under cover of the digastric muscle, and also in the dissection of the submaxillary region, where it has been traced to the tongue. Its upper part should now be examined, and first its mode of exit from the cranium, through the anterior condyloid foramen. It pierces the dura mater by two separate parts, which unite into one stem at the entrance of the bony foramen. As it issues from

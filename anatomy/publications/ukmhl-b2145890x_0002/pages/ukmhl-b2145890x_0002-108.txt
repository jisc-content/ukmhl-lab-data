92 HEAD AND NECK. they issue from the cord in several separate fasciculi. In the case of the posterior root these are attached to the cord consecutively along a continuous straight line or slight furrow. The fasciculi of the anterior root, on the other hand, are not so regularly placed, but emerge from the cord over an area of some breadth. Fig. 15.

The size of the nerve-roots will be observed to differ greatly. The lower lumbar and upper sacral nerve-roots are much the largest, whilst the lower

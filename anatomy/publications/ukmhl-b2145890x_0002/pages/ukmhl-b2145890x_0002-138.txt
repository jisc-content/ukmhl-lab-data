HEAD AND NECK. 120 It is this portion of the artery that the surgeon selects, when the choice lies in his own hands, as the seat for applying a ligature. Its relations, therefore, must be studied with more than usual care. In front of the vessel are the coverings of the space in which it liesâ€”viz., superficial fascia, platysma, superficial descending supra-clavicular branches of the cervical plexus, and the deep cervical fascia. Towards its termination, however, as we have seen, it passes behind the clavicle and subclavius muscle, and here also it is crossed by the supra-scapular artery. But perhaps the most important anterior relation, and one which, in tying the vessel, may somewhat embarrass the surgeon, is that established by the external jugular vein and certain of its tributaries. This vein crosses in front of the artery close to the scalenus anticus, and whilst occupying this position, two, or it may be three, tributaries join it-viz., the transver- salis colli, the supra-scapular, and the anterior jugular veins. Observe further that the small nerve to the subclavius is carried vertically downwards in front of the artery. Below, the third part of the subclavian artery rests upon the first rib ; at* higher level and also emerging from under cover of the scalenus anticus, are the brachial nerves. Behind, the vessel is in contact with the scalenus medius, although the lowest brachial nervous trunk may intervene between the muscle and the artery. The subclavian vein is placed at a lower level than the artery and on a plane slightly anterior to it.

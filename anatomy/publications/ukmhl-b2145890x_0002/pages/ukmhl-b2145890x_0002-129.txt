SIDE OF THE NECK. belly of the omo-hyoid, the sternothyroid, and sterno-hyoid muscles. From its deep surface pro- cesses proceed which ensheath the thyroid body and trachea. Above, it is attached to the hyoid bone, whilst inferiorly it is prolonged downwards into the thorax in front of the great vessels at the root of the neck, and gains a loose attachment to the fibrous layer of the pericardium. The pre-vertebral fascia is a partition more deeply placed, which also stretches across the neck. As its name implies, it lies upon the prevertebral muscles behind the pharynx and oesophagus. On either side it may be traced outwards behind the carotid artery and internal jugular vein to the scalene muscles, which it clothes. Here it comes into relation with the brachial nerves and subclavian artery, and upon these it is prolonged downwards behind the clavicle into the axillary space to form the sheath of the axillary vessels, and establish a connection with the costo-coracoid membrane. In an upward direction it can be traced to the base of the skull, to which it is attached, whilst below it passes continuously into the thorax upon the longus colli muscles and behind the gullet. The sheath of the common carotid artery is formed under cover of the sterno-mastoid. It also encloses, as we shall afterwards see, the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve. The prevertebral fascia in great part forms its posterior wall, whilst the pre-tracheal layer enters to a certain extent into its formation in front. Delicate septa, in its interior, separate it into

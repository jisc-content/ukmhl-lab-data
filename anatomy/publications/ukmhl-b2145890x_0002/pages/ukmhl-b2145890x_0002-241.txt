223 ARTERIES OF THE FACE. lies directly below the interval between the two bicuspid teeth.* Arteries of the Face.—There are two main channels concerned in conveying blood to the face— viz., (1.) the transverse facial artery, a branch of the superficial temporal, and already examined (p. 203); (2.) the facial artery, a branch of the external carotid. In addition to these a great number of smaller vessels appear on the face with the sensory branches of the fifth nerve. Those which accompany the branches of the ophthalmic division are derived from the ophthal- mic artery, whilst those associated with the branches of the superior and inferior maxillary divisions pro- ceed from the internal maxillary artery. Facial Artery.—The facial artery will frequently be found smaller than usual. In such a case its deficiency is compensated for by an increase in the size of the transverse facial, or of some of the other vessels which appear on the face. The course of the facial artery in the neck has already been noted (p. 184). It enters the face by passing on to the lower jaw immediately in front of the masseter muscle. It then takes a very tortuous course forwards and upwards to a point a short dis- tance behind the angle of the mouth; from this it * If a line be drawn from the supra-orbital notch to the interval between the two lower bicuspid teeth, and from that onwards to the base of the lower jaw, it will pass over or close to the infra-orbital and mental foramina. This line therefore can be used as a guide in searching for these nerves.

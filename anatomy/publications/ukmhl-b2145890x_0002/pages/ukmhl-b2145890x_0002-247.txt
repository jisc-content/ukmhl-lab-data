THE AURICLE OR PINNA. 229 with great care. As a rule they are all present—the helicus minor being that which is most frequently absent. The two muscles of the helix, the tragicus and the anti-tragicus, are placed upon the outer face of the cartilage. The transversus and the obliquus lie upon the cranial surface of the pinna. The musculus anti-tragicus is the best marked mem- ber of the outer group. It lies upon the outer surface of the anti-tragus, and its fibres pass obliquely upwards and backwards. Some fasciculi can be traced upon the lower projecting part of the helix. The musculus tragicus is a minute bundle of short vertical fibres, situated upon the outer surface of the tragus. When well developed a slender fasciculus may sometimes be observed to pass upwards from it to the fore part of the helix, where it gains insertion into the spine of the helix. The musculus helicis major is a well marked band, which springs from the spina helicis, and extends upwards upon the fore part of the helix, to be inserted into the skin which covers it. The musculus helicis minor is a minute bundle of fleshy fibres which is placed upon the helix behind and a little below the point from which the spina helicis juts forward. The musculus transversus auriculce is found upon the cranial aspect of the pinna. It is generally the most strongly developed muscle of the series, and it consists of fibres bridging across the hollow which, on this aspect of the auricle, corresponds to the antihelix. The musculus obliquus auriculce is composed of some •

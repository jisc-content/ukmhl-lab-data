DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 89 a very remarkable fibrous band, which stretches out- wards from either side of the pia mater, so as to connect it with the dura mater. Its pial or inner attachment extends in a continuous line between the anterior and posterior nerve-roots, from the level of foramen magnum above to the level of the body of the first lumbar vertebra below. Its outer margin is widely serrated or denticulated. From twenty to twenty-two denticulations may be recognised. They occur in the intervals between the spinal nerves, and pushing the arachnoid before them, they are attached by their pointed extremities to the inner surface of the dura mater. By means of the ligamentum denticulatum of either side, the spinal cord is suspended in the middle of the sac of dura mater. Spinal Cord.â€”The spinal cord itself must now be studied in situ. It is a cylindrical structure, slightly flattened in front and behind, which extends from the foramen magnum of the occipital bone, where it is continuous with the medulla oblongata of the brain, to the lower border of the body of the first lumbar vertebra. Here it rapidly tapers to a point forming the conns medullaris. From the extremity of this, a slender filament, termed the filum terminate or central ligament, is prolonged downwards. In length, the cord measures in the adult from fifteen to eighteen inches. Throughout the greater part of the dorsal region it presents a uniform girth, but in the cervical and

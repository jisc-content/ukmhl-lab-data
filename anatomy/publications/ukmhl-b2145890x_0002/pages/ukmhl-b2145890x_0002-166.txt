I48 HEAD AND NECK. muscle, and is both broader and shorter. It springs from the posterior aspect of the manubrium sterm, and from the cartilage of the first rib. Diverging slichtly from its neighbour as it ascends, it is inserted into the oblique line on the outer face of the ala of the thyroid cartilage. An incomplete tendinous intersection may sometimes be noticed interrupting its muscular fibres. The thyro-hyoid lies on the same plane as tire sterno-hyoid ; indeed, it may be regarded as its continuation upwards. It takes origin from the oblique line on the thyroid ala, and is inserted into the lower border of the body and a part of the great cornu of the hyoid bone under cover of the sterno- hyoid and omo-hyoid muscles. Digastric and Stylo-Hyoid Muscles.-These muscles, as we have seen, limit the submaxdlary triangle inferiorly, and intervene between it and the carotid triangle. . The anterior belly of the digastric springs from an impression upon the base of the lower-jaw, close to the symphysis, whilst the posterior belly takes origin from the digastric fossa of the temporal bone under lover of the mastoid process and the trachelo- mastoid and sterno-mastoid muscle, Both bellies Converge as they proceed towards the upper border of hyoid bone, where they are joined by a strong round intermediate tendon. The posterior belly is he longer of the two, and is fusiform m shape ; the antertobelly is shorter and flatter, and descends m a

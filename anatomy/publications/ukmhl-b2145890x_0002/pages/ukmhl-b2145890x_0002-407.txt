389 SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. to open up the infra-orbital canal. In its posterior part its upper wall is usually so thin that it can easily be removed by one of the blades of a pair of forceps, but in front it sinks deeply under the rim of the orbital opening, and here the chisel must be employed. The superior maxillary nerve can now be defined and its branches displayed. The infra-orbital artery and vein, which accompany the nerve, will be exposed at the same time. Superior Maxillary Nerve.— The superior maxillary nerve springs from the Gasserian ganglion within the cranial cavity (p. 308). It is composed entirely of sensory fibres, and proceeds forwards under the dura mater to the foramen rotundum through which it passes into the spheno-maxillary fossa. The nerve is now carried across the upper part of this fossa and enters the infra-orbital canal, where it receives the name of infra-orbital. Finally, it emerges upon the face through the infra-orbital foramen, and breaks up, under cover of the levator labii superioris, into numerous branches, which form a dense plexus with twigs from the facial nerve. Its terminal filaments are distributed to the lower eyelid, the nose, and the upper lip. From its origin within the cranium to its termination on the face, the superior maxillary nerve pursues a nearly straight course, and in each stage it gives off one or more branches. These are:— ■ \ wt^' • f Recurrent (already described, (1.) Within the cranium, -< x I p. 310)-

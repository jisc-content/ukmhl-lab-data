It is composed of a few slender fasciculi which pass transversely forwards in the fatty tissue of the cheek to the angle of the mouth, where they mix with the fibres of the orbicularis and depres- sor anguli oris. The Depressor Anguli Oris (triangularis menti) is a flat triangular muscle which presents a broad origin from the external oblique line of the lower jaw. From this it proceeds upwards to the angle of the mouth and, much reduced in width, its fasciculi mix with those of the orbicularis oris and other muscles in this neighbourhood. The mental branck of the inferior dental nerve and its accompanying artery appear on the face under cover of this muscle.

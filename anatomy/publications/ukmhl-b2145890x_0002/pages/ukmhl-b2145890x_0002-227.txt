ORAL GROUP OF MUSCLES. 209 Zygomaticus Major, Risorius, and Depressor Anguli Oris.â€”These three muscles may be grouped together, seeing that they lie in the same plane and run towards the angle of the mouth. The platysma also occupies the same plane, and many of its fibres blend with the depressor anguli oris, whilst others are carried forwards into the risorius. The Zygomaticus Major is a long fleshy band which springs from the malar bone immediately ygomaticus major Risorius- Platysma Orbicularis Mental nerve and inf. labial artery Levator menti Depressor labii inferioris Depressor anguli oris Fig. 29. in front of the zygomatic suture. From this it proceeds downwards and forwards, and at the angle of the mouth some of its fibres are inserted into the skin, whilst others blend with the orbicularis oris and with the depressor anguli oris. The Risorius muscle is sometimes regarded as a continuation forwards on the face of the posterior fibres of the platysma; more frequently it takes independent origin from the fascia covering the PART III. p

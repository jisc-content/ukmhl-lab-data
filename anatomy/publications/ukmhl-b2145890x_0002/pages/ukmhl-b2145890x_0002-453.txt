THE THYRO-HYOID MEMBRANE. 435 should likewise be cleared away from the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. The broad thyro-hyoid membrane, the central portion of the crico-thyroid membrane, and the crico-thyroid muscles are now exposed, and their attachments may be defined. The Thyro-hyoid Membrane is a broad mem- branous sheet, which occupies the interval between the hyoid bone and the thyroid cartilage. It is not equally strong throughout, but shows a central thick portion and a cord-like right and left margin, whilst in the intervals between these it is thin and weak. The central thickened part (ligamentum thyro- hyoideum medium) is largely composed of elastic fibres. Above it is attached to the posterior aspect of the upper margin of the body of the hyoid bone, whilst below it is fixed to the sides of the deep med- ian notch, which interrupts the superior border of the thyroid cartilage. The upper part of its anterior sur- face therefore is placed behind the posterior hollowed out surface of the body of the hyoid bone ; a syno- vial bursa is placed between them, and in certain movements of the head and larynx, the upper border of the thyroid cartilage is allowed to slip upwards behind the hyoid bone. On each side of the strong central part, the thyro-hyoid membrane is thin and loose. It is attached below to the upper margin of the ala of the thyroid cartilage and above to the posterior aspect of the great cornu of the hyoid bone. It is pierced by the internal laryngeal nerve and superior laryngeal vessels. The posterior border of

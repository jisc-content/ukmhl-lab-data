TRIANGLES OF THE NECK. 139 the crico-thyroid muscle. The spinal accessory nerve will be found high up between the digastric and the sterno-mastoid. It soon quits the triangle by sinking into the substance of the sterno-mastoid. The Digastric Triangle may be divided very con- veniently into an anterior and posterior part by the stylo-maxillary ligament and a line drawn downwards from it. The portion in front has a distinct floor, composed, in great part, by the mylo-hyoid, and behind this by the hyoglossus muscle. The contents of the space may be classified according to the sub- division in which they lie :â€” Anterior Part. Posterior Part. (1.) Submaxillary gland. (2.) Facial artery and vein. (3.)

The most conspicuous object in the fore-part of the digastric triangle is the submaxillary gland. The

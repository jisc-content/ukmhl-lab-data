NERVES OF THE FACE. 219 with the malar branch of the orbital nerve, and in the eyelids they are connected with the various branches of the fifth nerve which are distributed to these structures. The infra-orbital branches are larger than either of the preceding, and they run horizontally forwards along the lower border of the malar bone, and under cover of the zygomaticus major to the infra-orbital region. Here they supply twigs to the muscles in this neighbourhood as well as to the muscles of the nose. They likewise communicate with the infra- orbital, nasal, and infra-trochlear nerves. With the infra-orbital nerve they form a complicated plexus {the infra-orbital plexus), under cover of the levator labii superioris. The cervicofacial division of the facial trunk proceeds forwards, with a slight inclination down- wards, in the substance of the parotid, and breaks up into three main branches, which are termed from the course which they takeâ€” 1. Buccal. 2. Supra-maxillary. 3. Infra-maxillary. In the parotid gland the cervico-facial division crosses the external carotid artery and receives several communicating twigs from the great auricular nerve. The buccal branch runs forwards upon the bucci- nator muscle to the angle of the mouth, where it ends in filaments for the orbicularis oris. It supplies the

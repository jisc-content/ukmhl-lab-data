THE ORBICULARIS PALPEBRARUM. 205 or internal tarsal ligament. It will be afterwards more fully examined, but it is necessary to notice it at present, seeing that it is closely connected with the origin of the orbicularis palpebrarum. The Orbicularis Palpebrarum is the sphincter muscle of the palpebral fissure. It is a thin sheet of muscular fibres, which occupies a very considerable area of the face. It is customary to regard it as being composed of two parts, a palpebral and an orbital. The palpebral portion is the part which lies upon eye- lids. It is thin and pale, and its fibres arise from the margins of the palpebral ligament. From this they sweep outwards upon the two lids, describing a series of gentle curves, and at the outer canthus, they obtain a feeble attachment to the external tarsal ligament. They form a continuous layer of uniform thickness in both eyelids, except at the margins of the palpebral fissure. Here, close to the bases of the eyelashes, there is a more pronounced fasciculus, which is termed the ciliary muscle. The orbital portion is placed upon the margin of the orbital opening; but it is not confined to this. It extends for some distance beyond it, upwards on the forehead, downwards on the cheek, and outwards so as to encroach upon the temporal region. The fasciculi which compose this part of the muscle are of a darker and coarser type. They all arise internally and sweep outwards around the orbital margin in the form of a series of concentric loops. The origin is a triple oneâ€”viz., (i.) from the inner part of the internal

371 CONSTRICTOR MUSCLES. frequently however, it is called the bucco-pharyngeal fascia* seeing that it is continuous in front with the buccal aponeurosis. Upon the posterior and lateral wall of the pharynx the dissector will not fail to notice numerous veins joined together in a plexiform manner. These constitute the pharyngeal venous plexus, which collects blood from the pharynx, soft palate, and prevertebral region, and communicates with the pterygoid plexus. Two or more channels lead the blood from it to the internal jugular vein (p. 285). This venous plexus together with the pharyngeal plexus of nerves will require to be re- moved in order to display the muscles properly. Constrictor Muscles.â€”The constrictor muscles are three flat sheets of muscular fibres which are so arranged that they overlap each other from below upwards ; thus the inferior constrictor overlaps the lower part of the middle constrictor, whilst the middle constrictor in turn overlaps the lower part of the superior constrictor. The three muscles are inserted in the mesial plane into a median raphe, which descends from the basilar process of the occipital bone along the posterior aspect of the pharynx. The inferior constrictor is narrow in front at its origin, but it spreads out as it passes backwards towards its insertion. It arises by two heads ; of these the lower springs from the posterior part of the * The bucco-pharyngeal aponeurosis is not to be confounded with the prevertebral fascia, which forms a distinct lamina, behind it (p. in).

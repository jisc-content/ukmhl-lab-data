SUPERIOR LARYNGEAL NERVE. 293 accessory nerve, and swells out into the ganglion of the trunk. The ganglion of the trunk is an elongated reddish- coloured swelling of about three-quarters of an inch in length, which is developed upon the stem of the vagus nerve half-an-inch below the base of the cranium. Strong branches of communication pass between this ganglion, the first loop of the cervical plexus, and the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. Further, the hypoglossal nerve is generally closely bound to it by fibrous attachment, in the midst of which some interchange of nerve filaments takes place. The branches of distribution which arise from the vagus nerve in the neck may now be studied. These are:â€” (1.) Pharyngeal. (2.) Superior laryngeal. (3.) Inferior or recurrent laryngeal. (4.) Cardiac. The Pharyngeal Branch springs from the upper part of the ganglion of the trunk, and runs downwards and forwards, superficial to the internal carotid artery, to end in the pharyngeal plexus. Very frequently it is replaced by two branches, of which the upper is the larger. The Superior Laryngeal Nerve is a much larger branch, which takes origin from the middle of the same ganglion. It passes downwards and forwards, but differs from the preceding, by passing under cover of the internal carotid artery. In this situation it

109 SIDE OF THE NECK. this muscle. By these layers it is attached along the mesial plane posteriorly to the ligamentum nuchse. Follow it forwards : At the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid it again splits into two lamellae, which encase the muscle and re-unite at its anterior margin. From this it is prolonged over the anterior triangle to the middle line, and passes continuously over to the opposite side of the neck. In its passage, however, from one side to the other, it obtains a firm attachment to the hyoid bone. Now examine its connections at the upper and lower limits of the neck. Above it is attached along the whole length of the base of the lower jaw. Behind the angle of the jaw it is carried upwards upon the surface of the parotid gland, as the parotid fascia, to gain attachment to the lower margin of the zygomaâ€” a connection which will be afterwards seen in the dissection of the face. Still farther backwards, it is fixed to the mastoid process, and to the superior curved line of the occipital bone. Its connections below are no less definite. It is attached to the anterior border of the clavicle, and to the top of the sternum. The latter attachment, how- ever, is of a somewhat" intricate character. As it is traced downwards between the two sterno-mastoid muscles, it will be found to split a short distance above the sternum into two layers. Of these, the superficial layer is the feeblest, and effects an attachment to the anterior border of the manubrium sterni, and to the inter-clavicular ligament. The deeper layer lies immediately in front of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-

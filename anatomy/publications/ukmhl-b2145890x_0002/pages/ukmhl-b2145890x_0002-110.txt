94 HEAD AND NECK. sub-occipital emerges by passing over the neural arch of the atlas, and the second cervical nerve by passing over the neural arch of the axis. The coccygeal nerve leaves the sacral canal through its lower aperture. The Spinal Root-Ganglia.— As we have noted, these ganglia are oval swellings developed upon the posterior nerve-roots just before they unite with the anterior roots to form the spinal nerve-trunks. They are usually found upon the posterior roots of all the nerves, although occasionally the ganglion may be absent in the case of the sub-occipital nerve. Except in the case of the two upper cervical nerves, and the sacral and coccygeal nerves, the spinal ganglia are formed upon the posterior nerve-roots as they lie in the intervertebral foramina. The ganglia of the first two cervical nerves lie upon the neural arches of the first and second cervical vertebrae respectively; the ganglia of the sacral and coccygeal nerves are placed within the sacral canal. Spinal Nerve-Trunks.—These we have seen to be formed by the union of the anterior and posterior nerve-roots immediately beyond the spinal ganglia, and from what has been said it must be evident that this union takes place in the case of the coccygeal and sacral nerves in the sacral canal, in the lumbar, dorsal, and lower six cervical nerves in the intervertebral foramina, and in the case of first two cervical nerves on the neural arches of the atlas and axis.

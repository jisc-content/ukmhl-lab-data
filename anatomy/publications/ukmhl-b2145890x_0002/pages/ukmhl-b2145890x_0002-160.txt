I42 HEAD AND NECK. and the cricoid cartilage. Except along a narrow interval on either side of the mesial plane, these struc- tures are covered by two muscular strataâ€”viz., a superficial layer formed by the sterno-hyoid and omo- hyoid, which lie on the same plane, and a deeper layer formed by the sterno-thyroid and its continuation upwards, the thyro-hyoid. In addition to these an elongated process of the thyroid gland not unfre- quently stretches upwards (usually upon the left side), under cover of the sterno-hyoid. If this be present, it will in all probability be observed to be attached to the hyoid bone by a narrow muscular band termed the leva- tor gtandtdat thyroidece. The divergent inner margins of the two small cricothyroid muscles as they extend upwards towards the lower margin of the thyroid cartilage will also be seen. Upon the crico-thyroid membrane, as it appears between these muscles, the small crico-thyroid artery runs transversely inwards. Below the cricoid cartilage the dissector comes upon the trachea, which extends downwards through the remaining portion of the middle line of the neck. As the tube descends it gradually recedes from the surface, so that at the upper margin of the sternum it lies very deeply. The length of this portion of the trachea varies with the position of the head. When the head is thrown as far back as possible, and the chin is raised, about two and three-quarter inches of the tube will be found between the cricoid and the sternum ; when, on the other hand, the head is held in its usual attitude, the length of the cervical part of the trachea will be diminished by about three-

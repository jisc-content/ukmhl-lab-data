INFERIOR THYRO-ARYTENOID LIGAMENT. 445 border of the lateral part of the crico-thyroid mem- brane. It is attached in front, close to its fellow of the opposite side, to the middle of the angular depres- sion between the two alse of the thyroid cartilage. From this it stretches backwards, and is fixed behind to the tip and upper border of the processus vocalis, which projects forwards from the base of the aryte- noid cartilage. The inferior thyro-arytenoid ligament is composed of yellow elastic fibres, and measures from its anterior attachment to the point of the processus vocalis from 14 to 16 m.m. in the male, and from 9 to 11 m.m. in the female (Krause). Its inner border is sharp and free, and is clothed by mucous membrane, which in this position is thin and firmly bound down to the ligament. Embedded in its anterior extremity there is a minute nodule of condensed elastic tissue. By removing the mucous membrane which lines the bottom of the laryngeal sinus the dissector will obtain a good view of the parts which bound the rima glottidisâ€”viz., in front, the angle of the thyroid cartilage; behind, the arytenoideus trans- versa muscle; on each side, the inferior thyro-aryte- noid ligament, the processus vocalis, and the inner surface of the arytenoid cartilage (p. 431). These parts are clothed by the lining mucous membrane of the larynx. The Superior Thyro-arytenoid Ligament sup- ports the false 'vocal cord. It is weak and indefinite, but somewhat longer than the preceding ligament.

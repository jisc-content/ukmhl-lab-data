8 HEAD AND NECK. muscle it becomes superficial by piercing the frontal portion of the occipito-frontalis, and, after a short course in the superficial fascia, it ends in the integu- ment of the forehead. The supra-orbital nerve is much larger than the preceding, and quits the orbit by turning upwards in the supra-orbital notch. The position of this notch in the superior margin of the orbit can generally be detected by the finger. The nerve now ascends under cover of the orbicularis palpebrarum and the frontal belly of the occipito-frontalis, and divides into an inner and an outer division. There is a slight difference in the manner in which these reach the surface. The inner division becomes superficial by piercing the anterior belly of the occipito-frontalis, whilst the outer division comes to the surface a little further on by piercing the epicranial aponeurosis. Both ramify m the superficial fascia over the parietal bone, and give numerous twigs to the skin. The outer division can be traced as far back as the lambdoidal suture. In the temporal region, nerves from three sources are to be found—(a.) from the facial nerve ; (b.) from the orbital branch of the superior maxillary division of the fifth nerve; (c.) from the auriculotemporal branch of the inferior maxillary division of the fifth nerve The temporal branches of the facial nerve will be noticed running upwards over„ the zygoma. They furnish twigs of supply to the attrahens aurem, frontal belly of the occipito-frontalis, orbicularis palpebrarum, and corrugator supercilii.

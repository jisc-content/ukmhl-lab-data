406 HEAD AND NECK. very short, and is placed on the upper and back part of the outer wall of the fossa. Its free border begins a short distance below the centre of the cribriform plate, and proceeds obliquely downwards and backwards to a point immediately below the body of the sphenoid, where it ends. The middle turbinated bone (Fig. 4°", 13) is also a part of the ethmoid. Its 'free border begins a short distance below the fore part of the cribriform plate, and at first takes a vertical course downwards {a to b); then bending suddenly, it proceeds backwards and ends midway between the body of the sphenoid and the posterior border of the hard palate (c). The inferior turbinated bone (Fig. 46, 15) Is an independent bone, and stretches backwards upon the outer wall of the nasal fossa, midway between the middle turbinated bone and the floor of the nose. Its lower free margin is somewhat convex from before backwards. Meatuses of the Nose.—The superior meatus (Fig. 46, 13) is a short narrow fissure between the superior'and middle turbinated bones. The posterior ethmoidal cells open into its upper and fore part by one, or in some cases, by several apertures. To bring these orifices into view the superior spongy bone should be turned aside by introducing the blade of a pair of forceps under its entire length, and forcing it outwards and upwards. Care should be taken not to injure the mucous membrane more than is absolutely necessary. The middle meatus is a much more roomy passage

71 DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. aortic intercostal arteries make their appearance between the transverse processes. Each of these vessels reaches this point by passing backwards in the interval between the body of a vertebra and the superior costo - transverse ligament. It joins the corresponding posterior primary division of the spinal nerve, and with it is distributed to the muscles and integument of the back. In the lumbar region similar branches are derived from the lumbar arteries. They are distributed upon the same plan. In both dorsal and lumbar regions these vessels, before reaching the back, furnish a small spinal branch which enters the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramen. These will be traced at a later period. The accompanying veins of the dorsal branches of the lumbar and intercostal arteries pour their blood into the lumbar and intercostal veins. These veins are of large size, being joined by tributaries from the dorsal spinal venous plexus, and also by others from the interior of the spinal canal. The Great Oblique Rotator Muscle of the Spine.â€”This muscle occupies the vertebral groove and stretches from the back of the sacrum up to the axis vertebra. Its fibres pass obliquely upwards and inwards from the transverse processes to the spines of the vertebrae, and it consists of three strata, to each of which a separate name is applied. The superficial layer is termed the semi-spinalis muscle; the inter-

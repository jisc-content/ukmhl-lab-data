DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 97 of anastomosing twigs derived from the same sources. The upper part of each, however, is constituted by the posterior spinal branch of the vertebral artery, and arises within the cranium. Briefly, then, the cord may be said to present on its surface three main arterial channels : one in the mesial plane anteriorly, one on either side posteriorly behind the posterior nerve-roots. From these channels pro- ceed the minute twigs which ramify in the pia mater, and supply the cord-substance. Veins of the Spinal Cord—These veins are small . and numerous, and their disposition cannot be said to correspond with that of the arteries. They are very tortuous, and form a plexus with elongated meshes. In the mesial plane in front, a longitudinal vein maybe observed running upwards under cover of the anterior spinal artery. Upon either side, the veins of the spinal cord effect communications, by means of small twigs which run outwards on the nerve-roots, with the veins in the spinal canal; above, they unite in the form of three or four tributaries, which pour their blood into the inferior petrosal sinuses or the inferior cerebellar veins. In its present condition, the anterior surface of the cord may be distinguished from the posterior surface by the following points of difference :— PART III. H

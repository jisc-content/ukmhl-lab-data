CRANIO-VERTEBRAL JOINTS. 357 vertebral arteries it is deficient; here its lower border forms an arch, under which the vessel and the first cervical nerve pass. The Occipito-atlantal Capsular Ligaments (Fig. 40, a) connect the occipital condyles with the lateral masses of the atlas. They completely surround the joints, and are connected in front with the anterior occipito-atlantal ligament, and behind with the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament. The occipital bone, therefore, round the foramen magnum is attached by special ligaments to each of the four portions of the atlas—viz., to the anterior arch, to the two lateral masses, and to the posterior arch. Dissection.—The remaining ligaments are placed within the spinal canal in connection with its anterior wall. For their proper display it is therefore necessary to remove with the bone pliers the laminae of the axis, and the posterior arch of the atlas. The tabular part of the occipital bone must, likewise, be taken away by sawing it through, on each side, immediately behind the jugular eminence and the condyle, and carrying the saw into the foramen magnum. The upper part of the tube of dura mater which still remains in the spinal canal must next be carefully detached. A broad membranous band stretching upwards over the posterior aspect of the body and odontoid process of the axis is displayed. This is the posterior occipito-axial ligament.

138 HEAD AND NECK. seen from the above list, are very numerous, but they can be classified according to the direction which they take through the space. One large nerve, the ninth cranial nerve or hypoglossal, takes a more or less trans- verse course across the upper part of the space close to the lower margin of the digastric muscle. Two descend vertically—viz., the vagus and the gangliated cord of the sympathetic. The vagus lies between and behind the common carotid artery and the internal jugular vein, and in the same sheath of fascia; the sympathetic cord is placed behind the carotid sheath upon the prevertebral muscles. The remaining five nerves traverse the triangle obliquely ; four running from above downwards and forwards — viz., the descendens noni, the thyro-hyoid, the superior and external laryngeal; and one—the spinal accessory— from above downwards and backwards. The descendens noni springs from the hypoglossal, and descends either within or on the surface of the carotid sheath. It is joined at the upper border of the omo-hyoid by one or two branches from the cervical plexus, and in this manner the ansa hypoglossi is formed. The thyro- hyoid is a minute nerve which arises from the hypo- glossal farther forwards. The superior laryngeal nerve descends behind the carotid vessels. It will be readily found, with the corresponding artery, in the interval between the hyoid bone and upper border of the thyroid cartilage. It enters the larynx by piercing the thyro-hyoid membrane. The external laryngeal nerve, a branch of the preceding, is a much smaller twig. It leaves the space by passing under cover of the omo-hyoid, and in the muscular triangle it enters

70 HEAD AND NECK. Lumbar Regionâ€”The internal branches of the posterior divisions of the five lumbar nerves are of small size, and like the corresponding twigs in the lower dorsal region, they have a purely muscular distribution. They end in the multifidus spinae muscle. The external branches sink into the substance of the erector spinas, and are concerned in the supply of that muscle, and also of the lumbar inter-transverse muscles. The upper three of these nerves are of large size, and become cutaneous by piercing the aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi. They have already been traced by the dissector of the lower limb to the skin of the gluteal region. The lowest external branch communi- cates with the corresponding branch of the first sacral nerve. Blood-vessels of the Back.-In the cervical region the dissector has already noticed the artena profunda cervicis, the second part of the occipital artery, and its branch termed the arteria princeps cervicis. Deep in the sub-occipital region he will subsequently meet with a small portion of the verte- bral artery. In addition to these, however, minute twigs may be discovered in a well-injected subject, passing backwards from the vertebral artery, where it occupies the intervals between the tranverse processes, and also where it lies in the sub-occipital space. These supply the muscles, and anastomose with the other arteries in this region. In the dorsal region the dorsal branches of the

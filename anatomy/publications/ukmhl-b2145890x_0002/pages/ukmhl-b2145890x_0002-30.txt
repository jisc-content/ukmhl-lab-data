15 HEAD AND NECK. When the skull-cap is detached, the outer surface of the dura mater, as it covers the upper surface of the cerebral hemispheres, is brought under our notice. It is exceedingly rough, and dotted over with bleed- in* points. If a portion were placed in water, its roughness would become still more manifest, and be seen to be due to a multitude of fine fibrous and vascular processes, by which it is connected with the deep surface of the bones. These have necessarily been torn asunder in the removal of the skull-eap. The bleeding points are most numerous along the middle line, or in other words, along the line of the superior longitudinal sinus; and if the handle of the knife be run from before backwards, so as to make pressure along this line, a considerable quantity of blood will ooze out. This shows that a number of small veins from the cranial bones have been ruptured The degree of adhesion between the dura mater and the inner surface of the cranial bones varies in different subjects and in different localities. In all cases it is most adherent along the lines of the sutures ; and, as we shall afterwards see, it is very much more firmly attached to the base than the vault of the cranium In the child-indeed, so long as the bones of the cranium are growing-it is more adherent than in the adult; and it is also more firmly bound to the bone The dissector should now wipe the outer surface of the dura mater with a sponge. He will then recognise â€ž the substance of the membrane, and sending off its

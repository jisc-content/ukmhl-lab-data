PAROTID REGION. 201 distance under cover of the ramus of the jaw and the internal pterygoid muscle. The fascial connections of the parotid gland deserve some attention. The recess in which it lies is lined by a well-marked fascia, and we have noted the parotid fascia upon its superficial aspect. The entire gland is enveloped, therefore, in a strong envelope. 9 a {3 ID *t rt- Compressor naris i; Levator labii sup. alasque nasi Levator anguii oris Zygomaticus major Buccinator Masseter Temporal muscle Inf. dental vessels and nerve Parotid Stylo-gloss us Int. pterygoid Temporo-maxillary vein Ext carotid Post, belly of digastric S terno-mastoid Antrum of Highmore Dorsum of tongue Tonsil Pharynx Ascending pharyngeal artery Prevertebral muscleB Stylo-phuryngeus Internal carotid Vagus Stylo-hyoid Int. jugular vein Vertebral artery FlG. 28. Transverse section through the head at the level of the point of the nose and lower part of the superior maxillary bone. The section has passed in such a plane as to remove a portion of the roof of the mouth, and in the gap thus caused the dorsum of the tongue is visible. {Tracingfrom a frozen section, reduced.) The parotid fascia presents very important connec- tions. Above, it is attached to the zygoma; behind, it is attached to the meatus auditorius, and below that, splits to enclose the sterno-mastoid; in front it is continuous with the fascia over the masseter, whilst below, it is continuous with the deep cervical fascia.

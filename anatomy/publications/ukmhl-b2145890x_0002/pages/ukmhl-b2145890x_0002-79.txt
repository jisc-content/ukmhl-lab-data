DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 63 pierces near the external occipital protuberance, to reach the scalp. Two muscles constitute its deep relations—viz., the insertion of the superior oblique and the complexus. The following branches may be traced from this portion of the occipital artery :— (1.) Arteria princeps cervicis. (2.) Mastoid. (3.) Muscular. The arteria princeps cervicis is a twig of some size, which gives off a small branch to the deep surface of the splenius, and then sinks under cover of the complexus, where it will be subsequently dissected. The small mastoid artery enters the mastoid foramen to supply the diploe and the meninges of the brain. The muscular twigs go to the neighbouring muscles. The veins corresponding to the occipital artery are two, or perhaps three in number. They drain the blood from the occipital portion of the scalp, and open into the large vena profunda cervicis. The outermost of the occipital veins effects, as a general rule, a communication with the lateral sinus through the mastoid foramen. Complexus Muscle.—In cleaning this muscle, and in denning its attachments, care must be taken of the internal branches of the posterior primary divisions of the second, third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerves. The first of these—or, in other words, the great

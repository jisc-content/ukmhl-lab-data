65 DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. A thick dense fascia is placed over these subjacent parts, and in this we find certain of the cervical nerves and the anastomosis between the arteria princeps cervicis and arteria profunda cervicis. The dissector must specially look for a small twig from the sub- occipital nerve which enters the deep surface of the upper part of the complexus, and for a larger branch to the same muscle from the great occipital nerve. The inner margin of the complexus will be seen to be in contact with a mesial fibrous partition which separates it from the corresponding muscle of the opposite side. This is the ligamentum nuchae. The Ligamentum Nuchae is a strong fibrous partition placed in the mesial plane between the muscles on the back of the neck. It represents a powerful elastic structure in quadrupeds, which helps to sustain the weight of the dependent head. In man, however, there is not much elastic tissue developed in its midst, and it appears to be a con- tinuation upwards of the supra-spinous ligament from the spine of the seventh cervical vertebra to the external occipital protuberance. In shape it is somewhat triangular. By its base it is attached to the crest of the occipital bone ; by its anterior border it is fixed by a series of slips to the posterior tubercle of the atlas, and to the bifid spines of the cervical vertebrae in the intervals between their two tubercles. Its apex is formed by its attachment to the spine of the seventh cervical vertebra, whilst its posterior border is in a , measure free and gives origin to the part hi. f

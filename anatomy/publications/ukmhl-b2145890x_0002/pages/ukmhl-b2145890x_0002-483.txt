MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE. 465 side of the tongue to the tip where the two muscles become to a certain extent continuous. The hyo- glossus extends upwards to the side of the tongue and its fibres pass for the most part under cover of those of the stylo-glossus to reach the dorsum, over the back part of which they spread out beneath the the mucous membrane. The genio-hyo-glossus sends its fibres vertically upwards into the tongue on each side of the mesial septum, and its insertion stretches from the tip to the base. The fibres of the palato- glossus become continuous with those which form the stratum transversum. Fig. 55- Transverse section through the hinder part of the tongue.â€” {Froin Gegenbaur.) The chondro-glossus is not always present. It is separated from the deep surface of the hyo-glossus by the lingual vessels, and by the pharyngeal slip of the genio-hyo-glossus (p. 275). It is a slender muscular band which takes origin from the inner aspect of the root of the lesser cornu, and the adjoining part of the body of the hyoid bone. Its fibres ascend to enter the tongue, and finally spread out on the dorsum under cover of the lingualis superior. The superficial lingual muscle (lingualis superior) is part in. 2 H

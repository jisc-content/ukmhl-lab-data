CONSTRICTOR MUSCLES. 373 round the pharyngeal wall to meet its fellow of the opposite side in the median raphe. The lower fibres take a horizontal direction, but the remainder ascend with increasing degrees of obliquity, until the highest fibres reach the raphe at a point a short distance below the basis cranii. The lower margin of the inferior constrictor overlaps the commencement of the oesophagus, and passing upwards under cover of it so as to reach the larynx, will be seen the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the laryngeal branch of the inferior thyroid artery. The middle constrictor is a fan-shaped muscle. Narrow, and pointed in front, it arises from the great and small cornua of the hyoid bone as well as from the stylo-hyoid ligament. From this its fibres radiate widely, and pass round the pharyngeal wall, to be inserted with the corresponding fibres of the opposite side into the median raphe. The lower portion of this muscle is overlapped by the inferior constrictor, and in the interval which separates the margins of the two muscles in front, the internal laryngeal nerve and the laryngeal branch of the superior thyroid artery will be seen piercing the thyro-hyoid membrane to gain the interior of the larynx. The superior constrictor possesses a somewhat com- plicated origin, and to bring this fully into view, it will be necessary to cut through the internal pterygoid muscle about its middle, and turn the upper and lower portions aside. In doing this, be careful of the small tensor palati muscle which lies immediately subjacent to the internal pterygoid.

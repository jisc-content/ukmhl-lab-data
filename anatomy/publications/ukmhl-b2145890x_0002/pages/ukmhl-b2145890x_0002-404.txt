386 HEAD AND NECK. triangular plate of cartilage, which is folded upon itself so as to protect the tube on its upper and inner aspects. The cartilage is deficient below and externally, its place being taken by dense fibrous tissue, which connects the margins of the cartilage and completes the wall of the canal. This explains the characteristic form which its pharyngeal orifice presents (p. 378). A muscular slip, which descends from the outer margin of the cartilage in relation to the outer unprotected side of the tube, has been termed the dilatator tubes (Rudinger). It joins the tensor palati. The interior of the tube is lined by mucous membrane continuous with that of the pharynx, and it will be noticed that, as the tube is traced towards the pharynx, it generally increases in calibre. Hence it is frequently described as trumpet- shaped. CAROTID CANAL AND SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. Carotid Canal. â€” The carotid canal, which traverses the fore part of the petrous bone, may now be opened up by removing its inferior wall with the bone-pliers. In doing this, it is not necessary to interfere with the Eustachian tube, which lies in close proximity. It is well to preserve this structure until we undertake the dissection of the otic ganglion. The carotid canal contains the internal carotid artery and the stout ascending branch of the superior cervical ganglion.

ARTERIES ENTERING THE CRANIAL CAVITY. 37 and inferior. The superior petrosal sinus runs along the superior border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and joins the lateral sinus. The inferior petrosal sinus is the larger of the two, but has a shorter course. It passes backwards and outwards in the groove between the basilar process of the occipital bone and the inferior margin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It leaves the cranial cavity by passing through the anterior compartment of the jugular foramen, and ends by joining the commencement of the internal jugular vein. The Basilar Sinus—Fig. 8 (P6)—is not a single channel, but a plexus of minute sinuses which per- meate the dura mater over the basilar process of the occipital bone. It connects the two inferior petrosal sinuses, and posteriorly communicates with the anterior intraspinal veins. The Spheno-Parietal Sinus—Fig. 8 (Ssp)~is a minute blood channel which runs inwards under shelter of the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. Externally it commences in one of the small meningeal veins, whilst internally it pours its blood into the fore part of the cavernous sinus. Owing to its position, this sinus is somewhat difficult to demonstrate. Arteries entering the Cranial Cavity.—The student has now examined the various channels by means of which the venous blood is drained out of the cranial cavity. He should next examine the arteries which introduce the blood into this cavity. These are—

404 HEAD AND NECK. The vestibular part (Fig. 46, 6', 6) of the outer wall is a depression of a somewhat oval form placed immediately above the aperture of the nostril. It is partially divided into an upper and lower portion by a short ridge which projects forwards from its posterior boundary, and it is clothed throughout by integument continuous with the external skin. From this a number of stout stiff hairs termed vibrissa project (Fig. 46, 5)- The vibrissa which spring from the anterior part of the region incline backwards, whilst those which are implanted into the posterior part are directed forwards ; in this manner a sieve- like arrangement is provided at the anterior aperture of the nose. The vestibular part of the outer wall is placed opposite the corresponding area on the septum nasi, and the two together constitute an ampullated entrance to the nasal fossa. The capacity and shape of this section of the cavity is influenced to a certain extent by the contraction of the nasal muscles. The atrium meatus medii (Fig. 46, 8) is placed above, and slightly behind the vestibular district, and it receives its name from the fact that it leads directly backwards into the middle meatus of the nose. It is slightly hollowed out and concave, and on its upper part, near the nasal bone, a feeble elevation may sometimes be noticed which begins close to the fore part of the attached margin of the middle turbinated bone and proceeds obliquely downwards and forwards (Fig. 46, 9). This has been termed by Schwalbe, the Â« rudiment of the anterior turbinal," and he considers that it is the represent*-

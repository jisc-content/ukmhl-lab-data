Minute arteries—branches of the lateral sacral artery —accompany the sacral nerves and anastomose with twigs from the gluteal and sciatic arteries. The Posterior Division of the Coccygeal Nerve is a slender twig which emerges from the inferior opening of the sacral canal, and, after being joined by a filament from the last sacral nerve, is dis- tributed on the back of the coccyx. Dorsal Spinal Venous Plexus.—A plexus of veins is situated upon the superficial aspect of the neural arches of the vertebrae, and traces of it may be detected by carefully removing the multifidus muscle. This plexus collects blood from the integu- ment and muscles of the back, and in the dorsal and lumbar regions pours it into the posterior tributaries of the intercostal and lumbar veins. In the neck it is especially well marked, and its blood is emptied into the vertebral vein. It is hardly to be expected, however, that the dissector, in an ordinary dissection, will make out much of these veins. The last day upon which the body is allowed to remain in its present position must be devoted to the dissection of the sub-occipital triangle, and to the display of the spinal cord, its membranes, nerve- roots, and blood-vessels. Sub-Occipital Triangle.-This space may now be examined, but in the event of the dissector being

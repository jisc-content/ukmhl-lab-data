VERTEBRAL ARTERY. 347 pair of muscular slips lies between the atlas and the axis ; the lowest pair connects the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra with the transverse process of the first dorsal vertebra. The cervical nerves will be observed to have a very definite relation to the intertransverse muscles. The anterior primary branches of the lower six cervical nerves make their appearance by passing outwards between the two slips of the corresponding muscles. The posterior primary divisions of the same nerves turn backwards behind the posterior muscular slips. The upper two cervical nerves emerge from the spinal canal, as we have already noticed, differently from the others. They pass backwards over the neural arches of the atlas and axis respectively. The first or suboccipital nerve has been sufficiently examined at a previous stage of the dissection (p. 303); but the dissector is now in a position to observe that the anterior primary division of the second cervical nerve turns forwards under cover of the posterior slip of the first intertransverse muscle, and winds round the outer side of the vertebral artery, to appear behind the anterior slip of the same muscle. Vertebral Artery.—Remove the intertransverse muscles as well as the muscles still attached to the transverse process of the atlas—viz., the rectus lateralis, the inferior oblique, and the superior oblique.

Eyelids—The stitches which hold the margins of the eyelids may be removed, but the tow which has been introduced beneath them may be allowed to remain in its place, in order to keep the parts tense during the dissection. The following strata will be exposed in each eyelid as the student dissects from the surface towards the conjunctiva lining its deep aspect :— Upper Lid. 1. Integument. 2. Palpebral part of the orbi- cularis palpebrarum. 3. The tarsi and the palpe- bral ligament. 4. Levator palpebrse supe- riors. 5. Conjunctiva. Lower Lid. Integument. Palpebral part of the orbi- cularis palpebrarum. The tarsi and the palpebral ligament. Conjunctiva. In addition to these structures, two ligaments named the internal and external tarsal ligaments will be noticed. They attach the tarsi to the inner and outer margins of the orbit. The dissection should be carried on in both eyelids at the same time. Integument and Orbicularis.—These strata

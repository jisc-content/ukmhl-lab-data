The upper canal at first ascends for a short distance, whilst the lower one descends, and then changing their direction suddenly, they both run inwards in relation to the upper and lower margins of the tendo oculi. They open close together into the outer and anterior aspect of the lachrymal sac at a point slightly above its centre. The upper canal is the smaller and longer of the two, and it inclines downwards as well as inwards to reach the lachrymal sac ; the lower canal is nearly horizontal in direction. The Lachrymal Sac is the blind upper and somewhat expanded part of the passage which con- ducts the tears to the nasal cavity. It is lodged in the deep lachrymal groove in the forepart of the inner wall of the orbit, and it is crossed in front a short distance above its middle by the tendo oculi, from the deep surface of which, as we have already noted, it receives a fibrous expansion. The lachry- mal canals open into it under cover of this ligament. The nasal duct is the term which is applied to the lower part of the same passage. It descends in the bony nasal canal, and opens into the forepart of the inferior meatus of the nose. In length it measures about half-an-inch. The Tensor Tarsi Muscle is a little muscular slip which can now be seen arising from the crest

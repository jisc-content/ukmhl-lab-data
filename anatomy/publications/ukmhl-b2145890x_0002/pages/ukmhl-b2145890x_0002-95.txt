79 DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. which go to supply five muscles—viz., the two recti, the two oblique muscles, and the complexus. In addition to these muscular twigs, however, it gives a communicating, and sometimes a cutaneous filament. The communicating branch generally proceeds from the nerve to the obliquus capitis inferior, and joins the internal branch of the second cervical nerve (great occipital); this in turn is usually joined with the corresponding branch of the third cervical nerve, and in this way the posterior cervical plexus, described by Cruveilhier, is formed. The cutaneous branch when present accompanies the occipital artery to the integument over the occiput. Vertebral Artery.—It is only a small portion of this vessel which occupies the sub-occipital triangle. Emerg- ing from the foramen in the transverse process of the atlas, it runs backwards and inwards in the groove upon the posterior arch of the same bone. In this course it crosses the sub-occipital nerve, and lies immediately behind the lateral mass of the atlas. It leaves the space and enters the cranial cavity through the fora- men magnum by turning forwards below the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament and piercing the dura mater. Small branches proceed from the vertebral artery in this situation to supply the parts in its immediate neighbourhood, and to anastomose with the arteria princeps cervicis and the arteria profunda cervicis. Dissection to open the Spinal Canal.—The first step consists in thoroughly cleaning the vertebral laminae and spinous processes upon either side. The

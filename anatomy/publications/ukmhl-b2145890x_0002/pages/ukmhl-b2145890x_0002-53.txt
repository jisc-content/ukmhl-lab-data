MENINGEAL ARTERIES. 39 through the foramen spinosum of the sphenoid, and divides into two large terminal branches. Of these, the anterior branch ascends upon the great wing of the sphenoid, and the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, grooving both deeply, whilst the posterior branch turns backwards upon the squamous portion of the temporal bone. The wide distribution of these vessels in the dura mater has already been noticed. The anterior meningeal arteries proceed from the anterior ethmoidal artery as it lies on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, along with the nasal nerve. They supply a limited area of dura mater in the anterior fossa of the cranium. The small meningeal artery is somewhat inconstant, and not unfrequently springs from the middle menin- geal. It enters the cranium through the foramen ovale, but it should not be looked for at the present stage, as it is best examined along with the gasserian ganglion and the three divisions of the fifth nerve. The meningeal arteries from the ascending pharyn- geal artery are the terminal twigs of this vessel, and enter the cranium through the foramen lacerum medium, through the jugular foramen, and through the anterior condyloid foramen. The branch which passes through the jugular foramen is the largest. " The meningeal arteries of the occipital and vertebral are very small. The former enter through the jugular foramen, whilst the latter gains admittance to the cranium through the foramen magnum.

! 7q HEAD AND NECK. Cervical Pleura.â€”The pleural sac of each side, with the apex of the corresponding lung, projects upwards into the root of the neck, and the dissector should now examine the height to which it rises, and the connections which it establishes. Its height varies in different subjects. In some cases it extends up for two inches above the sternal end of the first rib; in others for not more than one inch. It forms a dome- like roof for each side of the thoracic cavity, and is strengthened by a fascial expansion (frequently termed Sibson's fascia) which covers it completely, and is attached on the one hand to the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, and on the other to the inner margin of the first rib. Observe, further, that the cervical pleura is supported above by the scalene muscles, under cover of which it ascends into the neck, and that the subclavian artery arches over it Cervical Plexus-(Fig. 25).-This plexus is formed by the anterior primary divisions of the upper four cervical nerves. These nerves are much smaller than the lower cervical nerves which form the brachial plexus, and they have only a short course to run as inde- pendent trunks. With the exception of the first, each divides into an ascending and a descending branch, and these joining with each other, constitute the plexus, which, therefore, consists of three loops. The descending branch of the fourth nerve proceeds downwards to unite with the fifth nerve, and thus establish a connection with the brachial plexus. The cervical plexus thus formed has very definite

262 HEAD AND NECK. mylo-hyoid muscle, and, issuing from under cover of the superficial part of the submaxillary gland, it breaks up into numerous branches for the supply of two muscles—viz., (i.) the mylo-hyoid, and (2.) the an- terior belly of the digastric (p. 140). Lingual or Gustatory Nerve—This nerve is entirely sensory, and is covered in the first part of its course, like the other branches of the maxillary nerve; by the external pterygoid. Appearing at the lower border of this muscle, it proceeds downwards and for- wards between the internal pterygoid muscle and the lower jaw and enters the submaxillary region, where it will afterwards be traced to the tongue. It is placed in front and on a slightly deeper plane than the inferior dental nerve. In this region it gives off no branches, but under cover of the external pterygoid it is joined at an acute angle by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve. Very frequently, also, a communicating twig passes between it and the inferior dental nerve. The Chorda Tympani is a slender nerve which arises from the facial in the aqueduct of Fallopius. It gains the pterygo-maxillary region by traversing the tympanic cavity and appearing through the inner part of the Glasserian fissure. It will now be seen to run downwards and forwards under cover of the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw, and unite with the lingual nerve near its origin. It is joined by a slender filament from the otic ganglion.

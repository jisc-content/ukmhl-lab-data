HEAD AND NECK. 280 internal carotid and ascending pharyngeal arteries may now be followed up to the base of the skull. The three divisions of the eighth nerve, the hypo- glossal nerve, and the superior cervical ganglion, with their various connections and branches, must at the same time be dissected. This is an exceedingly diffi- cult dissection. A dense and tough fascia envelopes these structures, and a great amount of patience is •required to trace the branches of the nerves through it. One nerve—the pharyngeal branch of the vagus— which proceeds downwards and forwards upon the superficial or outer aspect of the internal carotid, is especially liable to injury, and must therefore be borne in mind from the very outset of the dissection. The internal laryngeal and the external laryngeal nerves have been previously displayed in the anterior triangle of the neck. These, if traced upwards, will lead to the superior laryngeal branch of the vagus, which is carried downwards upon the deep aspect of the internal carotid artery. At the base of the skull, all the nerve-trunks will be found making their appear- ance close together in the interval between the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery; whilst behind the vein, the rectus lateralis muscle and the first loop of the cervical plexus will be seen. Internal Carotid Artery.—The internal carotid artery is the channel through which blood is carried for the supply of the fore-part of the brain, the contents of the orbital cavity, and the appendages of the eye. Tt is one of the two terminal branches of the common

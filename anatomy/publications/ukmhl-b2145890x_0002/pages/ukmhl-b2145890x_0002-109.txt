93 DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. sacral and the coccygeal roots are the smallest. In the cervical region the roots increase in size from above downwards, but more rapidly in the lower members of the group ; in the dorsal region the roots of the first nerve are large, but those which succeed it are small and of uniform size. In relative length, and in the direction which they follow in the spinal canal, the nerve-roots also show great diversity. This is due to the spinal cord being so much shorter than the canal in which it lies. In the upper part of the cervical region the nerve- roots are short, and proceed outwards in a more or less horizontal direction. Below this the nerve-roots gradually lengthen, and have to descend in the spinal canal for a distance which is always increasing the farther down we go. The arrangement of the lower dorsal, the lumbar, sacral and coccygeal nerve-roots, is particularly characteristic. They are exceedingly long, and descend vertically from the lower portion of the cord, in the form of a bunch or leash which, from its appearance, has very fitly been termed the cauda equina. Mode of Exit of Spinal Nerves from Spinal Canal.â€”But how do the spinal nerves quit the spinal canal? The six lower cervical nerves, the dorsal nerves, and the lumbar nerves, make their exit through the intervertebral foramina; whilst the sacral nerves find their way out by the sacral fora- mina. The two upper cervical nerves, and the coccy- geal nerve, however, follow a different course. The

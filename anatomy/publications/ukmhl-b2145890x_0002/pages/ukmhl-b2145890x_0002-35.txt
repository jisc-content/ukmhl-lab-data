REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN. 21 termed the straight sinus—Fig. 6 (6), p. 27. Along its superior convex border its two layers separate so as to form with the endocranial layer of the dura mater, which they join, the superior longitudinal sinus— Fig. 6 (5), p. 27. Its inferior concave margin is free and overhangs the corpus callosum, with which, how- ever, it is not in contact, except, perhaps, very Fig. 5. The dura mater.—(Luschka).

Running backwards in this margin is the inferior longitudinal sinus. Removal of the Brain.—The dissectors should now proceed to remove the brain. Having divided the attachment of the falx cerebri to the crista galli, pull it backwards, together with the dura mater which covers the upper surface of the hemisphere.

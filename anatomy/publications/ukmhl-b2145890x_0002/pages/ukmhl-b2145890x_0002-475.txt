THE CRICO-ARYTENOID ARTICULATION. 457 oideus lateralis is inserted; into its posterior aspect the crico-arytenoideus posticus is inserted. Near the apex of the arytenoid cartilage a small nodule of yellow elastic cartilage is frequently placed upon the external border and is held in this position by the investing perichondrium. It is termed the sesamoid cartilage. The anterior border of the arytenoid cartilage is prolonged into the projecting anterior angle of the base. This is called the processus vocalis. It is sharp and pointed, is directed horizontally forwards, and gives attach- ment to the inferior thyro-arytenoid ligament or true vocal cord. The base of the arytenoid cartilage presents an elongated concave facet on its under aspect, for articulation with the upper border of the posterior lamina of the cricoid cartilage. The Crico-arytenoid Articulation is of the diarthrodial variety. There is a distinct joint cavity surrounded by capsular ligament which is lined by a synovial membrane. The cricoid articular surface is convex, that of the arytenoid concave ; both are elongated in form, but they are placed in relation to each other, so that the long axis of the one intersects or crosses that of the other, and in no position of the joint do the two surfaces accurately coincide ; a por- tion of the cricoid surface is always left uncovered. The movements allowed at this joint, as the dissector can readily determine, are of a two-fold kindâ€”(1.) glidings by which the arytenoid is carried inwards or outwards, or in other words, a movement by which the

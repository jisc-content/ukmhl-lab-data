408 HEAD AND NECK. The inferior meatus is the horizontal passage which extends backwards between the inferior turbinated bone and the floor of the nasal fossa. It is placed behind the vestibule, and the free border of the projec- tion, which corresponds to the inferior turbinated bone, turns downwards in front so as to limit it Fig. 47. Outer wall of nasal fossa.—{From Gegenbaur.) The middle and inferior turbinated bones have been taken away. anteriorly (Fig. 46). This condition, together with the backward slope of the floor, renders the inferior meatus more accessible to the current of expired air than to the current of inspired air (Schwalbe). In the fore part of this meatus will be found the open- ing oi" the nasal duct—the canal which conveys the

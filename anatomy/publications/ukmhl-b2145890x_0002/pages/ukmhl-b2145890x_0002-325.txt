307 FIFTH CRANIAL NERVE. under aspect, and, passing out of the cranium by the foramen ovale,* connect it with the pterygoid venous plexus. The cavernous sinus is formed in the same manner as the other venous sinuses. The two layers of the dura mater are separated from each other, and the interval is lined by a delicate membrane. A compli- cated network of interlacing filaments occupies the lumen of the channel, and it is on this account that the term " cavernous " is applied to it. But, as we have already indicated, this sinus has an unusual importance to the anatomist on account of its being- traversed by the internal carotid artery, the cavernous plexus, and the third, fourth, and sixth nerves, with the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve. The precise relation which these structures bear to its walls will be described later on ; in the meantime it is only necessary to state that, while they are contained in the interval between the two layers of the dura mater, they are shut out from the blood-channel by the delicate lining membrane of the sinus. Fifth Cranial Nerve.â€”The two roots of this nerve have already been seen piercing the dura mater at the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone Under the anterior extremity of the tentorium. Now that the dura mater has been raised from the lateral part of the middle cranial fossa the further relations of these nerve-roots within the cranium * Or it may be through the foramen Vesalii when such exists m the sphenoid bone.

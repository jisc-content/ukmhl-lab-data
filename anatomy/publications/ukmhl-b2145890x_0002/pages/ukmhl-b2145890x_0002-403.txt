335 EUSTACHIAN TUBE. of the internal maxillary, the ascending pharyngeal, and the dorsalis linguae. Eustachian Tube.â€”This is the canal which conveys air from the pharynx to the tympanic cavity. It is divided into two portions, accord- ing to the parts which enter into the construction of its walls. Thus, in the outer part of its course as it nears the tympanum, its walls are bony, and it runs in the interval between the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bone. The inner part is placed on the base of the skull and is lodged in the gutter or groove between the apex of the petrous part of the temporal bone and the great wing of the sphenoid. This is the subdivision of the tube which comes under the notice of the dissector at the present stage, and he should first note its direction and then study its relations and the construction of its walls. The direction of the canal can be readily ascer- tained by passing a probe into it through its pharyn- geal orifice. It will be seen to run backwards and outwards with a slight inclination upwards. At the same time it will be noticed to pass between the origins of the levator palati, which lies upon its inner side, and the tensor palati, which is placed upon its outer side. This relationship is best seen in coronal sections through the frozen head. The dissector should now proceed to remove the mucous membrane from around the pharyngeal orifice of the tube. This will reveal the fact that its wall is strengthened by a PART III. ~ r

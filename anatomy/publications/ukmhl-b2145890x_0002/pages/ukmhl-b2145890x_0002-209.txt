DISSECTION OF THE FACE. 191 complete circles ; posteriorly they are deficient, and in consequence the trachea is flattened behind. Above it is continuous with the larynx, and throughout its whole course it is placed in the mesial plane of the body. The anterior relations of the trachea have already been fully discussed in connection with the description of the parts occupying the middle line of the neck (p. 143). Posteriorly it rests upon the gullet. Upon either side is the common carotid artery ; whilst closely applied to it in its upper part is the lateral lobe of the thyroid body. The recurrent laryngeal nerve ascends on each side in the angle between the trachea and oesophagus. The cesophagus or gullet is a narrow tube with thick muscular walls, which extends from the pharynx to the stomach. In the cervical part of its course it lies between the trachea and the prevertebral muscles, and as it descends it inclines slightly to the left, so that it comes more closely into relation with the lateral lobe of the thyroid body and the carotid sheath upon this side than with the same structures on the opposite side. DISSECTION OP THE FACE. The deep parts of the neck cannot be displayed satisfactorily until the pterygo - maxillary and submaxillary regions have been opened up. It is necessary, therefore, at this stage to leave the neck and proceed with the dissection of the face. Here, the following structures have to be examined :â€”

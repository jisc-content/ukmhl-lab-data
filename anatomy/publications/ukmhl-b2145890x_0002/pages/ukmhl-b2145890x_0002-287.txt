THE GENIOHYOID. 269 fasciculi of the preceding muscle. The nerve of supply to the stylo-glossus comes from the hypo- glossal. The Genio-Hyoid is placed close to the mesial plane, and in contact with its fellow of the opposite side. It is a short muscle which arises from the lower of the two genial tubercles upon the posterior surface of the symphysis of the lower jaw, and extends down- wards and backwards to gain insertion into the fore aspect of the body of the hyoid bone. The hypo- glossal gives the nerve of supply to the genio-hyoid. Submaxillary Gland and Wharton's Duct. —The submaxillary gland consists of a superficial and a deep portion, the superficial or main part has already been noted as the most conspicuous object in the digastric triangle. In size and shape it may be compared to a walnut, and it presents very definite relations. It is covered by skin, superficial fascia, platysma, and deep fascia, and lies under shelter of the body of the lower jaw—a distinct depression in the bone corresponding to its upper and outer surface. Behind it is shut off from the parotid by the stylo- maxillary ligament, whilst in front it is limited by the anterior belly of the digastric. It rests upon the mylo-hyoid, whilst lodged in a deep groove in its substance is the facial artery. The deep part of the gland is a slender prolongation which is tucked round the posterior margin of the mylo-hyoid and comes to lie between it and the hyo-glossus.

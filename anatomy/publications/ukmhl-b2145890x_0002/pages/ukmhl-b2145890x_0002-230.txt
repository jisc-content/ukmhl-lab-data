2I2 HEAD AND NECK. The Depressor labii inferiorisâ€”otherwise called the quadratus menti, is a quadrate muscle partially hidden by the depressor anguli oris which overlaps it (Fi<* 29). It springs from the lower jaw by a linear origin which extends from the symphysis to a point a short distance beyond the mental foramen, and passing upwards, with a slight inclination inwards, it joins the corresponding muscle of the opposite side, and finally blends with the orbicularis oris. Levator Menti {levator labii inferioris).--To expose this small muscle the lower lip must be everted and the mucous membrane removed at the side of the froenum of the lower lip. It is a short, well-marked fleshy band, which springs from the incisor fossa of the lower jaw and proceeds downwards and slightly forward, to be inserted into the skin of the chin between the two depressor muscles of the lower hp (Fig. 29). The Buccinator Muscle must be cleaned with care, because branches from the facial nerve and the long buccal nerve form a plexus upon its surface, and great numbers of nerves enter it, both for the purpose, of supplying it, and also for the purpose of reaching the Lucous membrane of the mouth which lines its deep The 'buccinator muscle occupies the interval between the upper and lower jaws. Above and belotv its fibres take origin from the outer surface of the alveolar margins of both of these bones as far forward as the Zt molar tooth. Behind, its posterior border is

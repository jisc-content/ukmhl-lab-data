119 TRIANGLES OF THE NECK. lie behind the clavicle, whilst the transversalis colli artery and vein occupy a higher level. In cleaning the brachial nerves which come out between the scalenus anticus and medius, a point to be attended to is to be careful not to injure the nerve to the sub- clavius. It passes vertically downwards upon the anterior aspect of the brachial trunks, and must be secured before they are touched. When the dissector has reached the lowest trunk of the brachial plexus, he will encounter the subclavian artery, which must be thoroughly displayed, and the groove on the first rib on which it lies rendered evident by scraping it with the handle of the knife. By tracing the external jugular vein downwards, the subclavian vein will be found lying very deeply—indeed so deeply that it can hardly be said to lie within the space at all. The scalenus anticus muscle, with the phrenic nerve pass- ing downwards upon its anterior aspect, will also be observed. Both lie under cover of the sterno-mastoid, and they will be more fully studied afterwards. Subclavian Artery.—It is only the third part of the subclavian artery which is included in the supra- clavicular triangle. This portion of the vessel extends from the outer margin of the scalenus anticus to the outer border of the first rib. Here it enters the axilla and becomes the axillary artery. It takes a very oblique course ; at first it lies at a variable distance above the level of the clavicle, but as it runs from above downwards and outwards, it finally comes to lie behind the clavicle and the subclavius muscle.

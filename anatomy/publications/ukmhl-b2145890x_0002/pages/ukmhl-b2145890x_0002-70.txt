54 HEAD AND NECK. it about the middle of the dorsal region, and introduce under it the handle of a knife. On gently pushing this inwards between the fascia and the subjacent muscles, its attachment to the spines of the dorsal vertebrae and supra-spinous ligaments will be made out â€¢ next carry the handle of the knife outwards, and the fascia will be seen to be firmly fixed externally to the angles of the ribs. Follow it upwards and down- wards, and particularly note its different relation to the two serrati muscles. Superiorly it proceeds under cover */the serratus posticus superior and splenius muscles, and is lost in the deep fascia of the neck ; infenorly it blends with the aponeurotic tendons of the serratus posticus inferior and the latissimus dorsi, and forms the posterior lamella of the lumbar fascia. The lumbar fascia is an exceedingly dense aponeur- otic structure, which gives great support to the muscles of the loins, and also serves as a means of origin for two of the flat muscles of the abdominal wall-viz., the transversalis abdominis and obliquus internus It is attached internally to the vertebral column by three distinct lamellae, which are separated from each other by intervening muscular masses. The posterior or superficial lamella is at present seen stretching out- wards on either side of the lumbar spines. It is formed, as we have already observed, by a continua- tion downwards of the vertebral aponeurosis, and by a union with this of the aponeurotic tendons of the latissimus dorsi and the serratus posticus inferior Divide this lamella in the longitudinal direction about one inch external to the middle line.

The septal branch of the nasal proper will be found descending over the fore part of the nasal septum. It runs between the mucous membrane and the septal cartilage, and. its terminal twigs may be traced as far as the vestibule. The arteries which convey blood to the septum nasi are: (i.) the naso-palatine, which accompanies the nerve of the same name ; (2.) a branch of the anterior ethmoidal accompanying the septal branch of the nasal nerve ; (3.) some minute twigs to the upper part of the septum from the posterior ethmoidal artery; (4.) the septal branch of the superior coronary artery, which is distributed upon the columna nasi. Nasal Fossae.â€”The mucous membrane of the septum may now be divided by the scissors along the roof of the nasal cavity. Before doing this, disengage from its surface the naso-palatine nerve and the septal branch of the nasal nerve proper, in order that they may be afterwards traced to their origins. When the layer of mucous membrane thus detached from the roof of the nose is thrown inwards the nasal fossa is exposed. The nasal fosses are two chambers placed one on each side of the septum nasi. They are extremely narrow, but the vertical depth and anteroposterior length of each fossa is very considerable. The width

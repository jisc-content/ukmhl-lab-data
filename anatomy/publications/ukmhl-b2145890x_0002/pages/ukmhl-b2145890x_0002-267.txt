THE INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. 249 lower head of the external pterygoid. The superficial and smaller head of the internal pterygoid springs from the lower and back part of the tuberosity of the superior maxilla and also from the outer surface of the tuber- osity of the palate bone ; the deep head, hidden by the external pterygoid, arises in the pterygoid fossa from the inner surface of the external pterygoid plate, and from the surface of the tuberosity of the palate bone, which appears between the two pterygoid plates. The two heads of the muscle unite at the lower margin of the fore part of the external pterygoid, and its fibres proceed downwards with an inclination backwards and outwards. They gain insertion into the angle of the lower jaw, and into the lower and back part of the inner aspect of the ascending ramus as high as the inferior dental foramen. The Internal Maxillary Artery is the larger of the two terminal branches of the external carotid artery, and takes origin within the substance of the parotid gland, immediately behind the neck of the lower jaw. From this it proceeds forwards to the fore part of the zygomatic fossa, where it disappears from view, by dipping between the two heads of origin of the external pterygoid muscle, and entering the spheno-maxillary fossa. It is customary to divide it into three parts for convenience in description. The first part runs horizontally forwards under cover of the neck of the lower jaw, and upon the internal lateral ligament. It lies along the lower border of the posterior part of the external pterygoid muscle

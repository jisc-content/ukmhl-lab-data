HEAD AND NECK. 300 The branches of distribution are :â€” (i.) Nervi molles. (2.) Pharyngeal. (3.) Superior cardiac. The nervi molles are soft delicate filaments which run towards the external carotid artery, and form a loose interlacement around it and its branches. From this plexus a branch "is given to the intercarotic body ; further, the part continued upon the facial artery supplies, as we have already noted, the sympathetic root to the submaxillary ganglion, whilst the sub- division upon the middle meningeal furnishes the corresponding root to the otic ganglion, as well as the external superficial petrosal nerve which runs to the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. The pharyngeal branches course inwards between the two carotid arteries to join the pharyngeal plexus. The superior cardiac nerve is a long slender branch which springs by several roots from the ganglion and then proceeds downwards behind the carotid sheath. At different stages of its course it is joined by other branches of the sympathetic, by the upper cardiac branches of the vagus, and also by filaments from the external laryngeal and recurrent laryngeal nerves. The right superior cardiac nerve is continued into the thorax by passing behind or in front of the sub- clavian artery, and it ends in the deep cardiac plexus. The left superior cardiac nerve follows the left common carotid artery in the thorax, and crossing the arch of the aorta ends in superficial cardiac plexus.

IO3 SIDE OF THE NECK. the skin and fascia along this line, many of the fibres mixing with those of the depressor anguli oris. When the platysma is strongly developed, the intermediate fibres are attached to the lower jaw itself. Reflection of the Platysma.—This must be done very-carefully, so as not to injure the structures which lie between it and the deep fascia. These are (1.) the external and internal jugular veins ; (2.) the descend- ing superficial branches of the cervical plexus, which are especially liable to injury as they cross the clavicle and acromion process, and (3.) the superficial cervical nerve and infra-maxillary division of the facial nerve. The muscle should be raised from below upwards, and left attached by its facial connections. The External Jugular Vein—Fig. 16 (10)—is usually a vein of some size. It will be seen emerg- ing from the substance of the parotid gland imme- diately behind the angle of the lower jaw, where it is formed by the junction of the posterior auricular vein, and posterior division of the temporo-maxillary vein. From this it descends in a nearly vertical direction upon the deep cervical fascia, taking a course which may be mapped out on the surface with tolerable accuracy, by drawing a line from a point behind the angle of the jaw to the middle of the clavicle. It crosses the sterno-mastoid very obliquely, and reach- ing the posterior margin of this muscle, disappears from view by dipping through the deep cervical fascia immediately above the clavicle. It will subsequently be traced to its termination in the subclavian vein.

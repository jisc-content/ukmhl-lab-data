Finally, it emerges upon the face by passing between the lower margin of the nasal bone and the upper lateral cartilage of the nose. Its terminal filaments have already been described (p. 221). The nasal nerve proper, therefore, takes a most circuitous route, being found—(1.) in the orbit; (2.) in the cranium ; (3.) in the nasal fossa; and (4.) in the face. Lenticular Ganglion.—The lenticular or ophthal- mic ganglion is a minute quadrangular body, not much larger than the head of a large pin ; but its size varies considerably in different subjects. It is placed in the back part of the orbit between the optic nerve and the external rectus muscle, and very commonly on the outer side of the ophthalmic artery. By its posterior border it receives its three roots; whilst from its anterior border the short ciliary nerves are given off. The sensory root comes from the nasal, and is called the long root. It enters the upper and hinder angle of the ganglion. The short or motor root is a short, stout trunk; it comes from the branch of the third nerve, which goes to the inferior oblique muscle, and it enters the lower and hinder angle of the ganglion. The sympathetic root comes from the cavernous plexus, and joins the posterior border of the ganglion, close to the entrance of the long root from the nasal nerve. In some cases its joins the long root before it reaches the ganglion.

DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 69 in so far that they take a course inwards towards the spinous processes. They differ from them, however, in running under cover of the semi-spinalis muscle, and in being entirely expended in the supply of muscles. Dorsal Region.â€”The external branches of the posterior divisions of the spinal nerves in this region proceed outwards under cover of the middle column of the erector spinae muscle, and appear in the interval between the longissimus dorsi on the one hand, and the sacro-lumbalis and accessorius on the other. The upper six or seven of these nerves are exhausted in the supply of the middle and outer columns of the erector spinae, and the levatores costarum ; the lower five or six, however, are considerably larger, and contain both motor and sensory fibres. After giving up their motor fibres, therefore, to the same muscles, they become superficial, by piercing the serratus posticus inferior, and the latissimus dorsi, in a line with the angles of the ribs.* The internal branches are also distributed differently in the upper and lower portions of the dorsal region. The lower five or six are very small, and end in the multifidus spinae. The upper six or seven pass inwards between the multifidus and semi-spinalis, and after supplying the muscles between which they are situated, they are directed backwards, and become superficial. In passing towards the surface they pierce the splenius, rhomboideus, and trapezius muscles.* * The cutaneous distribution of these nerves has already been exam- ined by the dissector of the upper limb.

FRONTAL NERVE. 319 The dissection of the above parts will be facilitated by grasping the front of the eyeball with the forceps, and drawing it forwards. It may be retained in this position by running a fine needle and thread through the ocular conjunctiva and stitching it to the nose. In doing this, however, take care that the needle does not penetrate the cornea, because this would render the subsequent inflation of the eyeball impossible. Frontal Nerve.—The frontal nerve is the continu- ation of the stem of the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve, after it has given off its lachrymal and nasal branches. It enters through the sphenoidal fissure above the muscles, and proceeds forwards upon the upper surface of the levator palpebral superioris. At a variable distance from the orbital opening, it ends by dividing into the supra-orbital and supra-trochlear nerves. The supra-trochlear nerve is the inner and smaller of the two terminal branches of the frontal. It runs towards the pulley of the superior oblique muscle, above which it leaves the orbit, by turning round the orbital arch to reach the forehead. Its further course has already been described (pp. 6 and 220). In the orbit it gives off one small twig close to the pulley of the superior oblique muscle. This passes downwards to join the infra-trochlear branch of the nasal nerve. The supra-orbital nerve is continued forward in the ■ line of the parent stem, and, passing through the supra-

224 HEAD AND NECK. ascends to the inner canthus of the eye, and much reduced in size by the numerous branches it has given off, it terminates by anastomosing with a twig from the ophthalmic artery. Throughout its whole length it is comparatively superficial. It is true that it is placed somewhat deeply in the fat of the cheek, but the only muscles which cover it are, from below upwards: the platysma, the risorius, and the zygom- atics major; but it is not uncommon to see its terminal twig embedded in the midst of the fibres of the levator labii superioris alseque nasi. The parts upon which it rests as it extends through the face, will be seen to be—(i.) the lower jaw ; (2.) the buccinator; (3.) the levator anguli oris ; (4.) the levator labii supe- rioris ; and (5.) the levator labii superioris alseque nasi. The facial vein does not accompany it closely in the face, but lies, above the level of the lower jaw, at some distance behind it. Several branches of the facial nerve cross it. The branches which it gives off are very numerous. Some of inconsiderable size pass backwards, and are distributed to parts in the buccal masseteric and malar regions, and anastomose with the transverse facial, the buccal, and the infra-orbital arteries. Others proceed forwards, and being of larger size, they receive special designations. They are :— (1.) Inferior labial. (2.) Inferior coronary. (3.) Superior coronary. (4.) Lateral nasal. (5.) Angular. The inferior labial arises immediately above the base of the lower jaw, and is carried forwards under

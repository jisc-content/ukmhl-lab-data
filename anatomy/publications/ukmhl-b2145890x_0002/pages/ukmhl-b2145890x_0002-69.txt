DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 53 digitations into the outer surfaces of four ribs—viz, the second, third, fourth, and fifth—a short distance in front of their angles. The serratus posticus inferior will be brought into view by raising and throwing inwards that portion of latissimus dorsi which the dissector of the upper limb has left attached to the lumbar fascia. The serratus posticus inferior will then be observed to take origin from the spinous processes of the last two dorsal and upper two lumbar vertebrae, as well as from the supra- spinous ligaments which stretch between these bony prominences. The dissector will note, however, that this is not an independent and distinct attachment, but that it is effected through the medium of the vertebral aponeurosis and posterior lamella of the lumbar fascia, with both of which the aponeurotic tendon of the muscle blends. The precise extent of the origin is thus rendered somewhat obscure. Directed upwards and outwards, the muscle is inserted by four digitations into the lower borders of the four lower ribs. Vertebral Aponeurosis and Lumbar Fascia.— It is now necessary that the student should study the connections of these fasciae. The connections of the vertebral aponeurosis can be easily made out. It is the strong, but thin and transparent fascia, which bridges across the hollow between the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrae and the first portion of the ribs; and it confines in this hollow the proper muscles of the spine and head; Make a transverse incision through

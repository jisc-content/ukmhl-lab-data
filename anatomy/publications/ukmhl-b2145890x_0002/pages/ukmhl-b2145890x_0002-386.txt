The pillars of the fauces spring from the base of the uvula, and arch outwards and then downwards. The anterior pillar as it descends inclines forwards, and ends upon the side of the posterior part of the tongue ; the posterior pillar, more strongly marked, inclines backwards, and is lost upon the side of the pharynx. The former encloses the palato-glossus muscle, the latter the palato-pharyngeus. In the triangular interval which is formed by the divergence of these two folds will be observed the tonsil. Pharynx.â€”The pharynx is a wide musculo- aponeurotic canal 4J inches long, which extends from the base of the cranium to the level of the body of the sixth cervical vertebra. Here at the lower border of the cricoid cartilage it becomes continuous with the oesophagus. Placed behind the nasal cavities, the mouth and the larynx, it serves as the passage which conducts air to and from the larynx, as well as the food from the mouth to the oesophagus. To obtain a proper idea of its connec- tions, the dissector should moderately distend its walls by stuffing it with tow. This may be intro- duced either from above, through the mouth, or from below, through the oesophagus. The pharynx will now present a somewhat ovoid

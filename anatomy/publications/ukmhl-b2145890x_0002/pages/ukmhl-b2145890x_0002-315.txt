297 HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE. the anterior condyloid foramen it lies deeply under cover of the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery, but it almost immediately inclines outwards, and, taking a half__s£iral turn around the trunk-ganglion of the vagus, it appears between the two vessels, and is continued downwards and for- wards. ' Its close connection with the ganglion of the trunk of the vagus has already been noted. The two nerves at this point are almost inseparably united by dense connective tissue, and in the midst of this an interchange of nerve fibres takes place. Gaining the lower border of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, the hypoglossal nerve hooks round the occipjtaL_artery, and enters the anterior triangle. Branches of communication.—-Near the base of the skull the hypoglossal is brought into connection with (i.) the superior cervical ganglion; (2.) the vagus; and (3.) the first cervical nerve. Further, as it turns round the occipital artery it receives the ramus lin- gij^Us^va^i from the pharjrigeaPpJexus, The importance of the connection between the hypoglossal and the first cervical nerve has already been alluded to (p. 150, v. Fig. 23). Branches of distribution.—With the exception of the minute recurrent, and vascular twigs, which come off within the condyloid foramen, the branches of distri- bution which proceed from the hypoglossal nerve have been described (pp. 149 and 274). The recurrent branch arises in the upper part of the anterior condyloid foramen, and, regaining the interior of the cranium, it is distributed to the dura mater around the foramen magnum.

232 HEAD AND NECK. convex, and continuous with the palpebral ligament; its inferior border is thickened and straight, and the integument adheres firmly to it. The inferior tarsal plate is a narrow strip which is similarly placed in the lower lid, and presents the same connections. At this stage the attention of the student cannot fail to be attracted by the Meibomian glands. To the naked eye they appear as closely placed parallel yellow granular-looking streaks, which run at right angles to .the free margins of the lids. They are more numerous and of greater length in the upper lid, and being lodged in furrows on the deep surface of the tarsal plates they are distinctly visible upon both aspects of these, even while the conjunctiva is in position. The ducts open upon the free margin of each lid behind the eyelashes, and by the aid of a magnifying glass they can be seen as round orifices placed in a single row. The mouths of these glands can be well demon- strated by squeezing the eyelid between the finger and thumb, when the greasy secretion of the glands will be pressed out. The palpebral ligaments are two broad membranous sheets which connect the tarsal plates to the upper and lower margins of the orbit. The superior liga- ment blends along the orbital arch with the peri- cranium, clothing the frontal bone, and with the periosteum lining the roof of the orbit, whilst inferiorly it is continuous with the thin upper margin of the tarsal plate. The inferior ligament has precisely

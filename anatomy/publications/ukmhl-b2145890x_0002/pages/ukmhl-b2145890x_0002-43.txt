29 CRANIAL NERVES. which the crura cerebri and superior cerebellar peduncles ascend. Beyond the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone the two margins of the tentorium cross each other like the limbs of the letter X 5 the ^ree margin is carried forward to be attached to the anterior clinoid process, whilst the attached border is continued inwards to be fixed to the posterior clinoid process (Fig. 7). Falx Oerebelli.—This is a small falciform fold of dura mater placed under the tentorium, which extends forwards in the mesial plane from the internal occipital crest. It occupies the notch which separates the two lateral lobes of the cerebellum posteriorly. Above it is attached to the posterior part of the under surface of the tentorium. Its anterior border is free ; whilst inferiorly it bifurcates into two small diverging ridges, which gradually fade away as they are traced forwards on either side of the foramen magnum. The Diaphragma Sellse is a small circular fold of the inner layer of the dura mater which forms a roof for the sella turcica. A very small opening is left in its centre for the transmission of the infundi- bulum. An almost complete case is thus formed for the pituitary body. Cranial Nerves.—The dissector should now turn his attention to the cranial nerves, and study the manner in which they leave the cranial cavities. Each nerve carries out with it a covering derived from each of the three membranes of the brain. .In the case of the optic nerve these remain distinct;

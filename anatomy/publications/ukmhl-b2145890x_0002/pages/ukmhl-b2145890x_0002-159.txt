MIDDLE LINE OF THE NECK. 141 are further disturbed the dissector should examine the structures which occupy the middle line of the neckâ€”a region, more especially in its lower part, of the highest importance and interest to the surgeon. It may be divided by means of the hyoid bone into an upper supra-hyoid and a lower infra-hyoidportion. In the supra-hyoid part are found structures which are concerned in the construction of the floor of the mouth. The student has already noticed that the fatty superficial fascia is more fully developed here than elsewhere in the neck, and that the anterior margins of the two platysma muscles meet in the mesial plane about half-an-inch or so below the chin. Above this point their fibres decussate. In the present condition of parts the two anterior bellies of the digastric muscles are observed attached to the lower jaw on either side of the symphysis. From this they descend towards the hyoid bone, diverging from each other slightly so as to leave a narrow triangular space between them. The floor of this space is formed by the anterior portions of the two mylo-hyoid muscles, whilst bisecting the triangle in the mesial plane is the fibrous raphe, into which these muscles are inserted. Not unfrequently the inner margins of the digastric muscles send decussating fibres across the interval between them. Examine, in the next place, the infra-hyoid part of the middle line of the neck. Below the hyoid bone is the thyro-hyoid membrane succeeded by the thyroid cartilage with its prominent pomum Adami. Then comes the tense crico - thyroid membrane

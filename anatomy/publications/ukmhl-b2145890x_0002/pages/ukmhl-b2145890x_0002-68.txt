52 HEAD AND NECK. the supra-scapular ligameut. The suprascapular nerve, on the other hand, is carried into the fossa under cover of the ligament. This completes the second day's work, and on the same day the dissector of the upper limb must finish his share of the dissection of the back, so as to allow the dissector of the head and neck to begin the examination of the deeper structures on the dorsal aspect of the trunk. Two days are allowed for this dissection, and these may be disposed of in the following manner :-On the first day all the muscles, fasciae, nerves, and blood- vessels of the back, with the exception of the sub- occipital triangle, should be studied; on the second day, the sub-occipital space must be examined, and the spinal cord displayed. Should the dissector find that the work is greater than he can undertake in the allotted time, the sub-occipital space may be left over until the head and neck is removed from the trunk. Serrati Muscles.-These are two thin sheets of fleshy fibres, which are placed upon the posterior aspect of the thoracic wall. The serratus posticus superior is much the smaller of the two ; it arises by a thin aponeurotic tendon-(i.) from the low* part of the ligamentum nuch* ; (2.) from the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra ; and (3.) from the spinous processes of the upper two Â« vertebra From this origin it proceeds obi quely flownwards and outwards, and is inserted by distinct

370 HEAD AND NECK. of the lower jaw ; (*.) to the hyoid bone ; (/) to the thyroid cartilage ; (g.) to the cricoid cartilage. Above it is attached to the basis cranii. These various attachments will be studied more fully when we dissect the constituents which enter into the con- struction of its wall. It should be noted that a false idea of the natural form of the pharynx is obtained when it is examined in its present stuffed condition and apart from the vertebral column against which it rests. When seen in transverse sections of the frozen body it will be observed that with the exception of its upper or nasal part, which remains under all condi- tions tolerably patent, the .anterior wall is in contact with the posterior wall, and it presents the appearance of a simple transverse slit. Pharyngeal Wall—The wall of the pharynx may be said to consist of three well-marked strata—viz., an external muscular, an intermediate aponeurotic, and an internal mucous. The muscular layer which is composed of the three constrictor muscles, with the stylo-pharyngeus and palato-pharyngeus on each side, should first be dissected. For this purpose, place the preparation so that the chin rests upon a block, and the pharynx hangs downwards with its posterior surface towards the dissector. The constrictor muscles should now be carefully cleaned in the direction of the muscular fibres, by removing the fascia which covers them. This areolar coating is sometimes spoken of under the name of the tunica pharyngis externa, more

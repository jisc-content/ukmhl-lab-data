PHARYNX. 369 form. It is widest opposite the hyoid bone ; from this upwards it narrows slightly as it ascends to the basis cranii. When traced in an opposite direction its width diminishes rapidly and uniformly, until it gives place to the oesophagus. Posteriorly its wall is complete, and when in position rests upon the upper five cervical vertebrae and the prevertebral muscles. To these it is bound by some lax connective tissue which offers no barrier to the movements of the canal during the process of deglutition. Laterally, the pharynx is related to the great vessels and nerves of the neck as well as to the styloid process and the muscles which take origin from it. These structures have all been dissected at a previous stage and have been retained. The dissector can, therefore, readily appreciate these important relationships. The vessels are the internal and common carotid arteries, the ascending pharyngeal artery, and the internal jugular vein ; the nerves are the three divisions of the eighth cranial nerve—(vagus, spinal accessory, and glosso- pharyngeal), the hypoglossal nerve, and the sympa- thetic cord. Upon this aspect of the pharynx also is placed the pharyngeal plexus of nerves, which supplies its walls with motor and sensory twigs. In front the pharyngeal wall is interrupted by the open- ings of the nose, mouth, and larynx, and it is to the structures which lie in proximity to these apertures that it derives its principal attachment. Thus from above downwards it is fixed—(a.) to the internal pterygoid plate; (£.) to the pterygo-maxillary ligament; (c.) to the side of the tongue ; (d.) to the inner aspect part in. 2 B

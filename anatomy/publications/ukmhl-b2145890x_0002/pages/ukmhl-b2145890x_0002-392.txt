374 HEAD AND NECK. The superior constrictor has a weak, but continuous line of origin, from the following partsâ€”viz., (a.) the lower third of the posterior border of the internal pterygoid plate, and the hamular process ; (b.) the pterygo-maxillary ligament which is common to it, and the buccinator muscle; (c.) the posterior end of the mylo-hyoid ridge on the inner aspect of the lower jaw; (d.) the mucous membrane of the mouth, and side of the tongue. From this somewhat exten- sive origin, the fibres curve backwards to reach the mesial raph6, whilst, as a rule, some of the highest gain a distinct insertion into the pharyngeal tubercle, on the under surface of the basi-occipital. The lower part of the superior constrictor is over- lapped by the middle constrictor, and in the interval between the two muscles will be seen the stylo- pharyngeus as it passes downwards under cover of the middle constrictor (p. 279). In the same interval will be seen the glossopharyngeal nerve. The upper border of the muscle is free and crescentic, and it falls short of the basis cranii. The Pterygo-maxillary Ligament can now be studied. It is a strong, narrow, tendinous band, which extends from the hamular process of the internal pterygoid plate, to the posterior part of the mylo- hyoid ridge of the lower jaw. It acts as a tendinous bond of union between the buccinator and superior constrictor, and its connections can be best appreci- ated by introducing the finger into the mouth and pressing outwards along its course.

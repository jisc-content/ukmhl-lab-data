MIDDLE LINE OF THE NECK. 143 s quarters of an inch. These measurements, however, must be regarded as merely expressing the average. They necessarily vary in different individuals, and are much influenced by the configuration of the neck. The dissector must study very carefully the parts which lie superficial to the trachea in this portion of its course. In the first place, examine those structures which are in immediate contact with it. These are (1.) the isthmus of the thyroid body; (2.) the inferior thyroid veins ; (3.) at the root of the neck, the inno- minate artery and the left innominate vein ; (4.) the thymus body in young children ; and (5.) the occa- sional thyroidea ima artery. The isthmus of the thyroid is a thin band of gland substance which crosses the mesial plane upon the anterior aspect of the trachea. As a general rule it covers the second, third, and fourth tracheal rings, so that only one ring, is left exposed between its upper margin and the cricoid. Almost invariably a branch of the superior thyroid artery runs along the upper margin of the isthmus, whilst upon its anterior surface is placed a plexiform arrangement of small veins. The inferior thyroid veins are two in number, and of large size. They arise in a great measure from the venous plexus upon the isthmus, and then proceed downwards upon the front of the trachea, one upon either side of the mesial plane, and separated from each other by a narrow interval. An additional median vein, taking origin from the isthmus, may also exist. Close to the sternum the innominate artery will be observed lying upon the trachea, and slightly below the level of the

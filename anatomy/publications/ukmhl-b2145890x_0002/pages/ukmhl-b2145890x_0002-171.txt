STERNOCLAVICULAR ARTICULATION. 153 joint. It is less strongly developed, however. By its posterior surface it generally gives origin to the sterno-hyoid muscle. These ligaments limit the movement of the inner end of the clavicle, backwards and forwards, upon the sternal facet. The Inter-Clavicular Ligament is a strong band which connects the inner ends of the two clavicles. It is firmly fixed to the upper edge of each bone, and as it passes across the middle line it dips into the notch on the upper margin of the sternum, and is, to a certain extent, attached to it. The Rhomboid Ligament is composed of short oblique fibres. It is placed behind the subclavius muscle, the remains of which must therefore be removed to expose its anterior surface ; at the same time the clavicle must be tilted upwards as high as possible. Below, the rhomboid ligament is attached to the cartilage of the first rib ; above, it is fixed to a rough depression upon the under surface of the inner end of the clavicle. The rhomboid ligament plays an important part in the mechanism of the joint, and adds greatly to its security. It checks excessive elevation of the shoulder, and restrains, within certain limits, both forward and backward movement of the clavicle. The Inter-Articular Fibro-Oartilage is the most important of all the agents concerned in maintaining

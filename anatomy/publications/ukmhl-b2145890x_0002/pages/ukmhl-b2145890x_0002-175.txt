157 ROOT OF THE NECK. jugular vein ; whilst ascending in the interval between the scalenus anticus and the rectus capitis anticus major, is the small ascending cervical artery. Between the scalenus anticus and the trachea will be found the internal jugular vein, the vagus nerve and common carotid artery, the first part of the subclavian artery with its branches, and the sympathetic cord. This is a tedious dissection, on account of the numerous twigs which are given off by the sympathetic in this locality. Certain of these descend in relation to the first part of the subclavian artery, and must be carefully preserved. The middle cervical ganglion, as a general rule, rests upon the inferior thyroid artery, whilst the lowest ganglion in the neck is placed in the depression between the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib. Scalene Muscles.—These muscles constitute the fleshy mass which is seen extending from the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae to the two upper costal arches. They are three in number, and are named, from their relative positions, anticus, medius, and posticus. The scalenus anticus is a well-defined muscle which is separated from the scalenus medius by the brachial nerves and the subclavian artery. It arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of four cervical vertebrae—viz., the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th,— and, tapering somewhat as it descends, is inserted into the scalene tubercle which marks the inner margin

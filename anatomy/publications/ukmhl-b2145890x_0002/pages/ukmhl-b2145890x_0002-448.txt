430 HEAD AND NECK. Owing to the tip of the epiglottis being curled forwards, the upper portion of this surface is convex ; this is followed by a slight concavity, and below this it swells out into a marked convexity called the cushion or tubercle of the epiglottis. In laryngoscopic exam- inations the tubercle always appears as a very con- spicuous object. The aryteno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane enclose between their two layers some connective tissue, the aryteno-epiglottidean muscles, and pos- teriorly the cuneiform cartilages, and the cornicula laryngis which surmount the arytenoid cartilages. When the superior aperture is examined by the laryngoscope these cartilages are visible on either side in the form of two small rounded elevations or tubercles. Between the outer aspect of the aryteno-epiglotti- dean fold and the ala of the thyroid cartilage, there is a deep depression of mucous membrane on each side termed the fossa laryngo-pharyngea. Middle Subdivision of the laryngeal cavity (Fig. 48, B).â€”This is the smallest subdivision of the cavity of the larynx. Above it is bounded by the false vocal cords, below by the true vocal cords, whilst it communicates by the intervals between these folds with the vestibule on the one hand, and the inferior compartment of the larynx on the other. The false vocal cords are two. prominent mucous folds which extend from before backwards on the side walls of the laryngeal cavity. They are soft and

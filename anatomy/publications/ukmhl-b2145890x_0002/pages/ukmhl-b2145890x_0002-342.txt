324 HEAD AND NECK. outwards and slightly backwards upon the upper surface of the eyeball, and under cover of the superior rectus. Beyond the outer edge of the latter muscle the tendon expands somewhat, and is inserted into the sclerotic coat midway between the entrance of the optic nerve and the cornea. The Pulley through which the tendon passes is a small fibro-cartilaginous ring, which is attached by fibrous tissue to the trochlear fossa—a depression in the frontal bone close to the internal angular process. The pulley is lined by a small synovial sheath which facilitates the movement of the tendon within it, and from its outer margin it gives a fibrous investment to the tendon. Dissection—The external rectus muscle should now be divided midway between its origin and its insertion, and the cut ends thrown backwards and forwards.' On raising the posterior part of the muscle

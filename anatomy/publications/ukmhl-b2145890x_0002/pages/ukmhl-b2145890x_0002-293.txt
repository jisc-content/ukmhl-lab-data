LINGUAL ARTERY. 275 mesial plane with its fellow of the opposite side. It arises by a short pointed tendon from the upper of the two genial tubercles which project from the posterior aspect of the symphysis of the lower jaw, and from this, its fleshy fasciculi spread out in a fan- shaped manner. By far the greater part of the muscle is inserted into the tongue by an insertion which extends from the tip backwards throughout the whole length of the organ ; below the tongue, a few fibres reach the side of the pharynx, whilst the remainder are inserted into the body of the hyoid bone. As we have already noted, the genio-hyo- glossus is supplied by twigs from the hypo-glossal nerve. Lingual Artery.—As the lingual artery is now fully exposed it can be conveniently studied at this stage. It springs from the fore part of the external carotid, and it is customary to describe it in three parts—viz., (1.) a part extending from its origin to the posterior border of the hyo-glossus muscle; (2.) a part lying in relation to the upper border of the hyoid bone ; (3.) a portion ascending under cover of the anterior border of the hyo-glossus muscle to the under surface of the tongue, where it ends in a terminal branch called the ranine artery. The first part has been fully examined in a previous dissection. It lies in the carotid triangle of the neck, and is therefore comparatively superficial. It is crossed by the hypoglossal nerve the tendon of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid. The second part proceeds

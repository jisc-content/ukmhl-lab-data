f PAROTID REGION. 199 for a short distance. It is from the thin anterior margin towards its upper part that the duct of the gland emerges, and frequently a small detached lobule of gland substance will be observed lying upon the masseter in relation to the upper aspect of the duct. This is termed the socia parotidis. The superficial or external surface of the parotid is slightly convex, and is covered by the dense parotid fascia which the dissector has already observed to be a prolongation upwards into the face of a portion of the deep cervical fascia (p. 109). In relation to this surface, and under cover of the fascia, there are usually one or two small lymphatic glands. The deep surface of the gland is in relation to many important structures, and is moulded upon the various parts with which it is in contact. To see these, the organ must be removed piece-meal in the manner described above, but it is necessary in the first place to study the duct, which conveys its secretion to the buccal cavity. Parotid Duct.â€”This is also called Stensoris Duct. It issues from the anterior border of the gland, about an inch or so below the zygoma, and then proceeds forwards upon the masseter muscle. In relation to it above will be seen the socia parotidis and the trans- verse facial artery, whilst accompanying it, below, are some branches of the facial nerve. At the anterior border of the masseter, it dips inwards, and, piercing the buccinator, runs forwards for a short distance between this muscle and the mucous membrane.

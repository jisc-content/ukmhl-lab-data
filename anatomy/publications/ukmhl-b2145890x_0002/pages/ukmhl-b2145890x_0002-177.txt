ROOT OF THE NECK. I $9 The relations of the subclavian artery are so numerous, and of so varied a character, at different parts of its extent, that it is found necessary to subdivide it into three portions, for convenience and accuracy of description. We take advantage of the scalenus anticus for this purpose. The first part extends from the origin of the vessel to the inner margin of the scalenus anticus ; the second portion is that part which lies behind this muscle; whilst the third part extends from the outer border of the scalenus anticus to the outer border of the first rib. First part.—Owing to the difference of origin, the relations presented by the first portion of the sub- clavian artery are not the same on both sides of the body. Let us ' examine, in the first instance, the vessel of the right side, and then compare it with that of the left side. The first part of the right sub- clavian extends obliquely upwards and outwards, and at its termination, at the inner margin of the scalene, it has reached a point above the level of the clavicle. It is placed very deeply. In front, it is covered by the skin, superficial fascia, platysma, deep fascia, and three muscular strata—viz., the clavicular origin of the sterno-mastoid, the sterno- hyoid, and the sterno-thyroid. Three veins and some nerves are also placed in front of it. Thus, it is crossed by the internal jugular and vertebral veins, as these proceed from above downwards, whilst the anterior jugular vein, as it passes outwards under ■cover of the sterno-mastoid, is separated from it by

These are the confines of the entire space, but when the deep cer- vical fascia is removed from its lower part the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid is brought into view. This is a narrow muscular band which enters the space at its postero-inferior angle, and proceeds upwards and forwards through it to disappear under cover of the sterno-mastoid * The posterior belly of the omo-hyoid subdivides the posterior triangular space into an upper portion called the occipital triangle, and a lower part termed the supra-clavicular or subclavian triangle. The occipital triangle is much the larger subdiv- ision It is bounded in front by the sterno-mastoid, behind by the trapezius, whilst its base is formed by the omo-hyoid. The supra-clavicular triangle is a very small space. It is limited above by the omo- hyoid, below by the clavicle, and in front by the sterno-mastoid. But it is well that the student should understand that the area thus circumscribed is of very variable extent. Indeed, in the natural position of parts, the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid as a rule passes forwards so close to the clavicle that a very small interval indeed * At this point it is well to warn the dissector that in cleaning the

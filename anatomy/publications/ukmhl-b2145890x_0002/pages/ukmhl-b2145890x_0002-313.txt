SPINAL ACCESSORY NERVE. 295 behind* or in front of the inferior thyroid artery, it disappears under cover of the lower border of the inferior constrictor muscle, to enter the larynx. Before the recurrent laryngeal nerve reaches the larynx it gives off several branches—viz., (1.) cardiac branches ; (2.) twigs to the trachea and oesophagus ; and (3.) a few filaments to the inferior constrictor as it passes under cover of its lower margin. The Cardiac Branches which the pneumogastric gives off in the neck are long slender filaments, which vary in number from one to three or even more. With the exception of the lowest branch of the left side, they unite with the cardiac branches of the cervical sympathetic. The lowest cardiac branch of the left pneumogastric has an independent course. It enters the thorax, and terminates in the superficial cardiac plexus. Spinal Accessory Nerve.—This nerve consists of two parts—an accessory and a spinal. In the foramen jugulare the accessory portion is connected by one or two fine twigs with the root-ganglion of the vagus, and below the skull it leaves the spinal part and joins the vagus. The fibres which the pneumogastric thus acquires pass over the surface of the trunk-ganglion, and are continued into the pharyngeal and superior laryngeal nerves ; some also can be * On the left side the nerve is usually in front of the artery; on the right side it is equally common to find it in front or behind (Dwight).

26 HEAD AND NECK. necessary to remove the membranes until the dissector is pre- pared to study the organ, so great is the permeating power of this fluid. . A description of how the brain is to be dissected, and also a short account of the more important points to be noted m connection with it, are given further on. It is best to undertake this after the dissection of the head and neck is completed. Dura Mater at the Base of the Cranium.-The dissector has observed that the dura mater can, as a rule be readily separated from the under surface of the cranial vault. He would find it impossible to raise it in like manner from the base of the cranium. It is closely adherent to the crusta galh, to the posterior margins of the lesser wings of the sphenoid, to the posterior clinoid processes, to the petrous portions of the temporal bones, to the basilar process of the occipital bone, and around the mar-in of the foramen magnum. Another cause of its close adhesion in this locality is, that it gives sheaths to the cranial nerves, and passes out of the cranium through the basal foramina to become con- tinuous with the periosteum on the external surface of the skull. So close, indeed, is the union between the dura mater and the base of the cranium, that it would require maceration to effect a complete separa- tion But the dura mater gives off, as we have already seen, at certain points processes which act as partial partitions within the cranial cavity. These next claim our attention ; they are four in number, viz.:â€” (i.) The falx cerebri (which has already been studied). (2.) The tentorium cerebelh.

The quadrilateral flap of skin thus marked out must be raised from the subjacent superficial fascia. On reaching the side of the neck, the head must be held well over to the opposite side. Here, unless the dissector keep close to the skin, there is a danger of slipping in under the posterior border of the sterno- mastoid muscle. Superficial Nerves—The nerves to be looked for in the superficial fascia, which is now exposed, are derived partly from the posterior primary divisions, and partly from the anterior primary divisions of the cervical nerves. They are :— Great occipital. (2.) Terminal twigs of the internal branches of the third, fourth, and fifth nerves. From anterior f (1.) Small occipital, primary divisions. I (2.) Great auricular. The great occipital-Tig. 10 (8)-should be first secured It is the internal branch of the posterior division of the second cervical nerve, and its branches of distribution have already been noticed, spreading out on the back of the scalp (p. 10). ' The main trunk may nowbe found piercing the trapezius about an inch below the occipital protuberance, and about half-an-mch external to the mesial plane. The fascia at this spot

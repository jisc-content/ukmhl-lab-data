DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 95 The dissector should open up two or three of the intervertebral foramina in both the dorsal and lumbar regions, so as to expose the ganglia and the nerve- trunks. This can very readily be effected by snipping away the articular processes by means of the bone- pliers. The nerve-trunk will then be seen to be exceedingly short; indeed, it is almost no sooner formed than it divides into its anterior and posterior primary divisions. In the case of the sacral and coccygeal nerves, this sub-division takes place in the sacral canal. The distribution of the posterior primary divisions has already been examined (p. 67). Removal of the Spinal Cord and its Mem- branes.â€”Cut across the cord and its membranes as high in the neck as possible, and then divide the nerves as they enter the intervertebral foramina. In as many cases as possible take the ganglia with the nerves. If the cord be now placed upon a wooden block, and the dura mater held widely open by pins, a very much better conception of the ligamentum denticulatum can be obtained than when the cord is within the spinal canal. Moreover, the manner in which the nerve-roots pierce the dura mater, and carry with them sheaths of the three membranes, can be studied. The linea splendens, or thickening of the pia mater along the mesial plane on the anterior surface of the cord, should also be looked for. To expose it, the dura mater must be slit open upon this aspect, and the arachnoid removed.

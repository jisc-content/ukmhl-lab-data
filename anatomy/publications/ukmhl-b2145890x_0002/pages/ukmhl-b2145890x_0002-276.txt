258 HEAD AND NECK. nerve,^) and (2.) the nerve to the internal pterygoid muscle, (f) The recurrent nerve is a very slender twig which enters the cranium by accompanying the middle meningeal artery through the foramen spinosunu It is distributed to the lining membrane of the mastoid cells and to the great wing of the sphenoid. The internal pterygoid nerve will be found passing under cover of the posterior border of the internal pterygoid muscle close to its origin. Surrounding the root of this nerve is the otic ganglion. From the two terminal divisions of the inferior maxillary trunk the chief branches of distribution arise. The anterior division is much the smaller of the two, and is composed almost entirely of motor fibres derived from the motor root of the fifth nerve. The only sensory fibres which it contains are those which form the long buccal nerve. It gives off the following branches:— (3.) External pterygoid. (1.) Masseteric. (2.) Two deep temporal. (4.) Long buccal. The large posterior division is chiefly sensory. It contains only a very few fibres from the motor root, and these are prolonged into its inferior dental branch, and afterwards come off in the form of the mylo-hyoid nerve. The branches of the posterior division are :— (1.) Auriculo-temporal. (2.) Inferior dental. (3.) Lingual (or gustatory). The masseteric nerve is directed outwards above the

HEAD AND NECK. 268 the hyoid bone, whilst the gland and duct occupy an intermediate place. Although the submaxillary ganglion is very minute, its relations are so precise that it is very easily found. By seizing hold of the lingual nerve and dissecting carefully with the point of the knife in the interval between it and the deep part of the submaxillary gland, the ganglion will be exposed and its roots and branches of distribution made out. Upon the genio-hyo-glossus in front of the hyo- glossus the dissector will note the sublingual gland with its artery of supply. Certain structures will also be seen passing under cover of the posterior margin of the hyo-glossus muscle ; these are:â€” (i.) the glosso- pharyngeal nerve immediately below the stylo-glossus muscle; (2.) The stylo-hyoid ligament, a little lower down ; and (3.) the lingual artery, close to the hyoid bone. The Hyo-Glossus is a quadrate flat muscle which arises from the whole length of the greater cornu, and also from the body of the hyoid bone. Its fibres pass upwards to the posterior part of the side of the tongue where they ascend under cover of the stylo- glossus. The hyo-glossus is supplied by the hypo- glossal nerve. The Stylo-Glossus is an elongated fleshy slip which takes origin from the anterior aspect of its styloid process near its tip. Passing downwards and forwards its fibres my be traced upon the side of the tongue as far as the tip. They decussate with the

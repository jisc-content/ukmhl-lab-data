LATERAL CARTILAGES AND JOINTS. 449 mucous membrane of the larynx below the rima glottidis. Laryngeal Arteries—The superior laryngeal artery, a branch of the superior thyroid, accompanies the internal laryngeal nerve; the inferior laryngeal artery which springs from the inferior thyroid accom- panies the recurrent laryngeal nerve. These two vessels ramify in the laryngeal wall and supply the mucous membrane, glands and muscles. LARYNGEAL CARTILAGES AND JOINTS. The cartilages which constitute the skeleton of the larynx and give support to its walls are the following:— (4.) Arytenoid, . . \ (1.) Thyroid, \ (5.) Cornicula laryngis 1 (2.) Cricoid, V single. or cartilages of \ paired. (3.) Epiglottis, J Santorini, . . j (6.) Cuneiform, . . ) They are held together by certain ligaments and joints. The mucous membrane and muscles must be care- fully removed from the cartilages, and the epiglot- tidean, crico-thyroid, and crico-arytenoid ligaments defined. Great caution must be exercised in clean- ing the arytenoid cartilages and the cartilages of Santorini, in order that the slender ligaments which attach the latter to the upper border of the cricoid cartilage may be preserved.

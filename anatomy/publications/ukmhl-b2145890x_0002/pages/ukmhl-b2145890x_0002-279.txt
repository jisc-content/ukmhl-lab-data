THE INFERIOR DENTAL NERVE. 261 (3.) some twigs to the parotid gland ; (4.) terminal filaments to the skin over the temporal region and summit of the head (p. 9); (5.) auricular branches. The auricular branches are usually two to the skin lining the interior of the external auditory meatus and two to the integument over the upper and fore part of the pinna. The former gain the interior of the meatus by passing between the osseous and cartilaginous portions of the canal. The Inferior Dental Nerve is the largest branch of the inferior maxillary. Emerging from under cover of the external pterygoid muscle it passes downwards upon the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw and enters the inferior dental foramen. The inferior dental artery runs downwards behind it, whilst the lingual nerve is in front of it and upon a somewhat deeper plane. The inferior dental is a sensory nerve, but a few motor fibres from the motor root are pro- longed downwards within its sheath as far as the dental foramen. At this point they come off as the slender mylo-hyoid nerve. The mylo-hyoid nerve, accompanied by the artery of the same name, pierces the internal lateral ligament and proceeds downwards and forwards in a groove upon the deep surface of the lower jaw to the sub- maxillary triangle. A narrow prolongation of the internal lateral ligament bridges over the groove and holds the nerve and vessel in position. In the sub- maxillary triangle the mylo-hyoid nerve has already been dissected. It appears upon the surface of the

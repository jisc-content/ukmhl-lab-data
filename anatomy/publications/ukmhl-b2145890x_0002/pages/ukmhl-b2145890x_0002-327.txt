309 FIFTH CRANIAL NERVE. of the two roots through the aperture in the dura mater, and gently dislodging the Gasserian ganglion from its place, turn it forwards and outwards so as to expose its deep surface. The small firm motor root can readily be recognised lying in a groove upon the deep surface of the ganglion, and if it be raised from this, it will be seen to have no connection with the ganglion, but to be continued onwards towards the foramen ovale. It ultimately joins the inferior max- illary division of the fifth nerve. This junction may take place within the cranium, in the foramen ovale, or immediately after they gain the exterior of the skull. The three principal divisions of the fifth nerve may next be examined. Begin with the inferior maxillary division, which is the largest. This proceeds directly downwards, and almost immediately leaves the cranial cavity through the foramen ovale. In isolating this large nerve trunk and defining the bony aperture through which it makes its exit, look carefully for the small meningeal artery which enters the cranium through the same foramen. If the injection has been forced into this vessel it can easily be detected. Through the foramen ovale the minute emissary veins which connect the cavernous sinus with the pterygoid venous plexus also pass. The superior maxillary division, which is composed entirely of sensory fibres, is prolonged forwards, and after a short course within the cranium, makes its exit through ,the foramen rotundum. Near its origin it gives off a fine recurrent branch to the dura mater.

64 HEAD AND NECK. occipital—runs little risk of injury from its great size, but the others are liable to be overlooked. They all emerge from the substance of the muscle close to the mesial plane. The complexus muscle placed in the cervical and upper dorsal regions inclines obliquely upwards and inwards to its insertion into the occiput. It arises by seven tendinous slips from the transverse processes of the last cervical and upper six dorsal vertebrae and by three slips from the articular processes of the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae. A thick fleshy muscle is thus formed, and this is inserted into a large, somewhat oval impression between the superior and inferior curved lines of the occipital bone, close to its crest. The muscle narrows somewhat as it passes upwards, and it is separated from its neighbour of the opposite side by the ligamentum nuchse. The inner portion of the muscle, which is to a certain extent distinct from the general mass, and is divided into two bellies by an intermediate tendon, is frequently designated the biventer cervicis. Dissection.—The complexus must now be reflected by detaching it from the occiput and throwing it outwards. This dissection requires great care, not only with a view to preserve the nerves which have been seen to perforate it to reach the surface, but also on account of the numerous important structures which it covers. In its upper part it lies over the sub-occipital triangle and the muscles bounding it, whilst below this it covers the semi-spinalis muscle.

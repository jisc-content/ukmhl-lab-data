382 HEAD AND NECK. fully. It consists of two minute slips which as a rule arise from the posterior nasal spine of the hard palate and lie one on either side of the mesial plane. As they proceed backwards into the uvula they unite into a single rounded muscular belly. Levator Palati.—This muscle has already been seen on the outer aspect of the pharynx in the sinus of Morgagni. To display it fully it is necessary to remove the wall of the pharynx between the Eustachian tube above, and the upper border of the superior constrictor below, and then follow its fibres into the soft palate. In a well-injected subject the dissector will observe the ascending palatine artery in relation to this muscle. The levator palati is a rounded fleshy muscle which arises from the lower and inner border of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube, and from the rough surface on the under aspect of the apex of the petrous bone in front of the carotid canal. It passes downwards and forwards, crosses the upper border of the superior constrictor, and piercing the pharyngeal aponeurosis enters the soft palate. Here its fibres spread out below the azygos uvulae and above the anterior or deep portion of the palato-pharyngeus. In front, some of the fibres are inserted into the palatal aponeurosis, but behind this, the larger proportion of the fibres become continuous with the corresponding fasciculi of the opposite side. Tensor or Circumflexus Palati.—This little

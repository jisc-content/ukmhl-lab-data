On ^posterior surface of the arytenoid cartilages and bridging across the interval between them, the dissector will observe the arytenoid muscle. Especial care must be taken in cleaning this muscle, in order that the connections of the superficial decussating fibres may be fully ascertained. The outer layer of the right aryteno-epiglottidean fold of mucous membrane, should now be cautiously removed. This will expose the aryteno-epiglottidean muscle, the cuneiform cartilage, and the cartilage of Santorini of that side. This is perhaps the most difficult part of the dissection, because the dissector has to establish the continuity of the sparse fibres which compose the pale aryteno-epiglottidean muscle, with the decussating fibres of the arytenoid muscle, and he has also to make out a delicate ligament, which extends downwards from the tip of the cartilage of Santorini to the cricoid cartilage-viz., the ligamentum jugale. The Posterior Orico-arytenoid Muscle is some- what fan-shaped. It springs by a broad origin from the depression which marks the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage on each side of the mesial ridge, and its fibres converge to be inserted into the posterior surface and outer angle of the processus muscularis of the arytenoidcartilage.* InpuÂ«ui^ "T^p^e^ of *e base of the arytenoid cartilage.

ROOT OF THE NECK. l6l Below, the first part of the subclavian rests upon the pleura, whilst the recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks round it to gain its posterior aspect. Further, observe that the right innominate vein is formed by the union of the internal jugular and subclavian veins below, and upon a plane anterior to this part of the artery. On the left side, the first part of the subclavian ascends almost vertically from its origin from the aortic arch, and reaching the root of the neck, it turns outwards over the pleura to gain the inner margin of the scalenus anticus. It is only with that portion of the vessel which lies in the root of the neck that we are concerned at present. Its relations are not very different from those on the right side. The same fascial and muscular layers, and the same nerves and veins, lie in front of it. Owing to its different direction, however, the latter are placed more or less parallel to it. Three additional relations are nevertheless, established-viz., (i.) the phrenic nerve which descends in front of it; (2.) the left innomi- nate vein, which crosses it; and (3.) the thoracic duct, which passes upwards in relation to its inner side. On the other hand, the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which on this side hooks round the arch of the aorta, has no direct relationship to the subclavian artery. Second part.â€”The second portion of the subclavian artery forms the highest part or summit of the arch. 1 he height to which this rises above the clavicle is part in. M

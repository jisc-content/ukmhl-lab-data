.g HEAD AND NECK. This nerve runs along the inner side of the great occipital, and, as a rule, communicates with it From its distribution, it is frequently termed the tlurd occipital nerve. Small Occipital Nerve-Fig. 10 (9).-This nerve will be found by dividing the fascia along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle. It springs from the anterior primary division of the second cervical nerve, and runs upwards to assist in the supply of the integument over the occiput. Its terminal twigs have already been dissected in the superficial fasaa of the scalp (P. 10). Occasionally the small occipital >s represented by two separate nerves. Great Auricular or Auriculo-Parotidean Nerve- Fig I (9)-Like the preceding, the great auricular ne^ve is a branch of the cervical plexus, and takes origin from the second and third cervical nerves. I J readily be exposed by drawing the head over to the opposite side and then dividing theTaa over the outer surface of the sterno-mastoid muscle very obliquely, beginning the incision at the posterior m fgin of the muscle about the middle of the neck "/carrying it upwards and forwards â€” th lobule of the ear. This incision corresponds with the course taken by the nerve. Near the lobule of the ear the great auricular nerve will be found to end by hiding into three sets of branches-viz., facial, auricular, and mastoid. # Zfaaal tranches will be traced afterwards in the dissection of the face. The others may be followed,

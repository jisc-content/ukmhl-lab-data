CRICO-THYROID MEMBRANE. 437 and strong membrane, which is attached below to the median part of the upper border of the anterior arch of the cricoid cartilage, and above to the lower margin of the middle portion of the thyroid cartilage. It is pierced by minute apertures, and is crossed super- ficially by the crico-thyroid branch of the superior thyroid artery. On each side, under cover of the crico-thyroid muscle, the lateral part of the crico- thyroid membrane presents very different connections. It is not attached to the lower border of the thyroid cartilage, but stretches upwards into the interior of the larynx, and takes part , in the formation of the true vocal cord. At a later stage of the dissection it will be fully exposed. Dissection.â€”The position of the larynx must now be reversed. Fix it upon the block in such a manner, that its posterior aspect is directed upwards. The oesophagus should then be slit open, by a mesial incision through its posterior wall. Next remove with great care the mucous membrane, which covers the posterior aspect of the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages. In doing this bear in mind that the inferior laryngeal artery, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve, pass upwards between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, and must be preserved. Upon the posterior aspect of the broad lamina of the cricoid cartilage, the dissector will now note the two posterior crico-arytenoid muscles, and the attachment of' the anterior band of longitudinal muscular fibres, which belongs to the oesophageal

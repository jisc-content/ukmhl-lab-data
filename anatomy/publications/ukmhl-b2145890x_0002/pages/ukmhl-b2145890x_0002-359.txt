PREVERTEBRAL REGION. 341 damaged. The base of the skull having been reached, the point of the knife should be carried across the basilar process of the occipital bone between the pharynx and vertebral muscles, so as to divide the thick investing periosteum. The basilar process must now be divided by means of a chisel. Still retaining the part upside down, place the skull so that its floor rests upon the end of a wooden block. Then apply the edge of the chisel to the under surface of the basilar process, adjust it accurately in the interval between pharyngeal wall and vertebral muscles, and with a wooden mallet drive it through the base of the skull, inclining it, at the same time, slightly backwards. The next step in the dissection consists in making two saw-cuts through the cranial wall. The head having been placed upon its side, the saw must be applied vertically to the outer aspect of the skull half- an-inch behind the mastoid process, and carried obliquely forwards and inwards to reach a point immediately behind the jugular foramen. The same saw-cut must be repeated upon the opposite side of the head. To complete the dissection the dissector must again have recourse to the chisel. Placing the prepar- ation so that the floor of the cranium looks upwards, divide the base of the skull, on each side, in the interval between the petrous portion of the temporal bone and the basilar portion of the occipital. In front, this cut should reach the outer extremity of the incision already made through the basilar process ;

SIDE OF THE NECK. IOI to the sternum below ; (2.) a transverse cut from the lower end of the mesial incision outwards along the line of the clavicle to the acromion process of the scapula; (3.) an oblique incision, beginning above at the mastoid process behind the ear, and carried downwards and forwards along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, until it meets the middle line of the neck at the top of the sternum. Two triangular flaps of skin, corresponding in a measure to the two triangular areas of the neck, are thus mapped out, and must now be carefully raised. Throw the anterior flap upwards towards the lower jaw, and turn the posterior flap backwards towards the trapezius muscle. Superficial Fascia.—The superficial fascia in this region contains in its midst the platysma myoides muscle—the representative in the human subject of the panniculus carnosus in the lower animals. In the male, the adipose tissue which distinguishes the superficial fascia is generally very sparse in this locality, so that the fleshy fibres of the muscle are observed shining through it. In females and children the fat is more abundant, giving a fuller and more rounded appearance to the neck. In all cases the fatty tissue is most plentiful between the chin and hyoid bone, forming in stout individuals the so-called " double-chin." Platysma Myoides—The fibres of this muscle, which run upwards and forwards, must now be cleaned

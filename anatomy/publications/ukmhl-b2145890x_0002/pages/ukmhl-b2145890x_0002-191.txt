CERVICAL PLEXUS. 173 The superficial'branches'have already been examined, but now that the plexus is fully dissected, the student should again study their mode of origin. Muscular Branches.â€”The anterior recti muscles and the rectus lateralis receive twigs from the first loop of the plexus, but as this is placed very high up in the neck, these branches can only be satisfactorily displayed in the deep dissection of the neck. The sterno-mastoid muscle draws one or more twigs from the second cervical nerve, and by means of these a close communication is effected with the spinal accessory, which pierces, and at the same time supplies filaments to the muscle. The levator anguli scapula always receives two or three branches from the third and fourth nerves, whilst the scalenus medius obtains its nerve supply from the same nerve-trunks before these have entered the plexus. The branches to the trapezius come off in common with the trunk which divides into the descending superficial nerves, and are therefore derived from the third and fourth nerves. Upon the under surface of the trapezius, these branches unite with the spinal accessory, and form the sub-trapezialplexus for its supply. The communicantes noni perhaps should have been included in the group of communicating branches, seeing that they join with the descendens noni; but the fibres which compose them are destined for the supply of muscles. They are usually two in number, and spring from the second and third nerves respectively. From this they proceed downwards and inwards under

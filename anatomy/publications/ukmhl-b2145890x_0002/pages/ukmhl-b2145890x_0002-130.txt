H2 HEAD AND NECK. three compartments—one for each of its three con- tents. The stylo-maxillary ligament is a strong process of the cervical fascia in the upper part of the neck, which passes from the angle and posterior margin of the lower jaw to the styloid process. It is firmly attached to these bones, and is so placed that it constitutes a firm fibrous partition between the sub- maxillary and parotid glands. It can readily be exposed at the present stage. Triangles of the Neck.-The sterno-mastoid muscle, as we have observed, divides the side of the neck into two triangular spaces-an anterior triangle placed in front of it, and a posterior triangle behind it This muscle, therefore, should be studied before proceeding further. Carefully clean its superficial surface, and define its attachments. Do not attempt, however, to raise it from subjacent structures in the meantime. Sterno-Mastoid.—The sterno-mastoid muscle takes its origin below by two heads-a sternal and a clavicular. The sternal head is rounded, and chiefly tendinous, and springs from the upper part of the anterior face of the manubrium sterni. The clavicular head is broad and fleshy, with only a few tendinous fibres intermixed, and it arises from the inner third of the upper surface of the shaft of the clavicle. A narrow interval separates these heads below, but at a higher level the sternal portion overlaps the clavicular, whilst half-way up the neck they both unite into

440 HEAD AND NECK. It is composed of transverse fibres which bridge across the interval between the two arytenoid cartilages, and are attached to the posterior concave surfaces of both of these cartilages. Dissection.—The further dissection of the laryn- geal muscles should be confined to the right side of the larynx. The left side should be reserved for the study of the nerves and vessels. Place the larynx on its left side, and having fixed it in this position, remove the right crico-thyroid muscle. The right lateral thyro-hyoid ligament should next be divided, and the right inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage disarticulated from its facet on the side of the cricoid cartilage. An incision should now be made through the right ala of the thyroid cartilage a short distance to the outer side of the mesial plane, and the detached piece carefully re- moved. Three muscles are now exposed, and must be carefully cleaned and defined. They are named from below upwards :— (i.) The lateral crico-arytenoid. (2.) The thyro-arytenoid. (3.) The thyroepiglottidean. The lateral Crico-arytenoid Muscle is triangular in form and smaller than the crico-arytenoideus posticus. It springs from the upper border of the lateral part of the cricoid cartilage as far back as the facet which supports the base of the arytenoid cartilage ; a few of its fibres likewise take origin

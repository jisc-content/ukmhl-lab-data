206 HEAD AND NECK. tarsal ligament, (2.) from the internal angular process of the frontal bone above this, and (3.) from the ascending process of the superior maxillary bone below it. Above and to the inner side the fasciculi of the orbicularis muscle are closely connected, and to a certain extent interlaced with the fasciculi of the frontal part of the occipito-frontalis, the corrugator supercilii and the pyramidalis nasi, whilst from its lower margin a few delicate fleshy bands are carried downwards through the soft fat to gain insertion into the skin of the cheek. Corrugator Supercilii.-This is a minute but very distinct band of dark coloured muscular fibres which can be exposed by raising the upper and inner part of the orbicularis with the frontalis muscle which is connected with it, from the superciliary ridge The corrugator supercilii will then be seen arising from the inner extremity of this ridge. Its fibres pass upwards and outwards, and the greater proportion of them pass through the fasciculi of the orbicularis and frontal belly of the occipito-frontalis to gain a direct insertion into the skin of the eyebrow; one of its muscular bundles, however, joins the orbicularis, whilst a few others blend with the frontalis. The Oral Group of Muscles.—The muscles of the lips and mouth which are included in this group are the following:—

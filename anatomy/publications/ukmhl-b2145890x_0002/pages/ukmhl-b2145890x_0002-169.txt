ANSA HYPOGLOSSI. obliquely. Sometimes it is enclosed within the carotid sheath, at other times it lies in front of it. Reaching the upper border of the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid, it ends by joining one or two slender branches which advance towards it from the second and third cervical nerves. These twigs are the rami commnnicantes noni^ and by their union with the descendens noni a looped plexiform arrangement is formed in front of the carotid sheath, which is called the ansa hypoglossi. From the convexity of this loop branches are given off which supply both bellies of the omo-hyoid, the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles. The branches for the anterior belly of the omo- hyoid may proceed from the descendens noni before it reaches the communicantes noni. The filament for the posterior belly runs downwards and backwards along the lower border of the intermediate tendon, and between the two laminae of the fascial band which retains the tendon in position. The branch for the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles is a nerve which breaks up along their outer margins into a number of twigs for their supply. One small filament may sometimes be traced into the thorax, where it communicates with the phrenic and cardiac nerves. The thyro-hyoid nerve is a slender twig which comes off from the hypoglossal as it approaches the hyoid bone. It supplies the thyro-hyoid muscle.

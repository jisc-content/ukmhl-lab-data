THE FACIAL ARTERY. I85 face; and (4.) that the facial vein passes backwards and downwards superficial to the submaxillary gland. Four named branches spring from the facial artery in the cervical part of its course:â€” (1.) The inferior palatine. (2.) The tonsilitic. (1.) The submaxillary. (2.) The submental. The inferior palatine artery is given off for the supply of the soft palate, but it also gives branches to the tonsil and Eustachian tube. It ascends between the stylo-pharyngeus and stylo-glossus muscles. The tonsillitic artery goes to the tonsil, and at present it is seen disappearing between the internal pterygoid and stylo-glossus muscles. Both of these vessels will be traced to their destination in the deep dissection of the neck, and in the dissection of the pharynx. The submaxillary branches are given to the gland during the sojourn of the facial artery in its midst. The submental artery is a branch of some size. It springs from the facial, close to the base of the inferior maxilla, and then runs forwards upon the mylo-hyoid muscle towards the chin. Near the symphysis it changes its direction, and is carried upwards over the base of the jaw, to end in branches for the muscles and integument of the chin and lower hp. In the submaxillary region it gives numerous twigs to the surrounding muscles, and anastomoses with the sublingual artery by branches which pierce the mylo-hyoid muscle. In the face it anastomoses with the inferior labial branch of the facial and the mental branch of the inferior dental. The cervical portion of the facial vein will be noticed

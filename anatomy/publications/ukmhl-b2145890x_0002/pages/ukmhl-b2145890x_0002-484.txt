466 HEAD AND NECK. a continuous layer of longitudinal fibres which covers the entire dorsum linguae, from the root to the tip, immediately beneath the mucous membrane. Towards the base of the tongue it is thinner than in front, and here, it is overlapped by the transverse fibres of the hyo-glossus, and is intermixed with the fibres of the chondro-glossus. The inferior lingual muscle (lingualis inferior) is a rounded fleshy belly which is placed upon the Fig. 56. Longitudinal section through the tongue.-{From Aeby.) (c) Lingualis superior. (/).

Behind, it lies in the interval between the hyo-glossus and the genio-hyo- glossus and shows an attachment to the hyoid bone ; in front it is prolonged to the apex of the tongue between the inner border of the stylo-glossus and the genio-hyo-glossus ; with the former it is more or less blended. The transverse muscular fibres (stratum trans- versum) lie under the lingualis superior, and constitute a thick layer which extends outwards from the lateral

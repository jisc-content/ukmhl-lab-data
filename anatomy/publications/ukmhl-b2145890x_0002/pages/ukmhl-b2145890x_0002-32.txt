At first sight these bod.es appear to be protrusions from the dura mater, but th,s rs not the ease. They spring from the arachnod M and are enlargements of the normal vrlh of this membrane. Their relation to the dura mater ,s simp y this that when they enlarge they become embedded Tk or perhaps even pierce it. Nor does the bone escape Examine the deep surface of the calvarmm, and in all probability you will observe small pus hollowed out by absorption for their ^Ptmn. Having learned these preliminary details from an examination of the outer surface of the dura mater, as "es the upper surface of the cerebral hem, pheres, the student is in a position to understand fcat this membrane does not belong entirely to the brain , hat> fact, it has to perform a double function-^ (,) to act as an internal periosteum to the bones o ming the cranial cavity ; and (2.) to give support to the different parts of the brain. Consequently, it conits of two strata, which, in most localities, are firmly adherent.but which nevertheless can usually be Zl demonstrated in the dissecting room These :of0Ur hp termed the enao- £ Sy»<= rf v=»« u~a i i» ■—

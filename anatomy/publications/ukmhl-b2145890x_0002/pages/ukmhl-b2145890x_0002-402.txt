The palatine branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery may also be traced into the soft palate. In cases where the preceding artery is small, this twig will be found enlarged so as to take its place (p. 282). The superior or descending palatine branch of the internal maxillary artery likewise sends small twigs to the soft palate and tonsil. The nerves of the soft palate are two branches from Meckel's o-an-lion-viz., the external and the small or posterior palatine nerves The levator palati and the azygos uvulae are supplied by the great superficial petrosal nerve-the fibres of supply being conducted through Meckel's ganglion and led to the muscles by the posterior palatine nerve. The tensor palati is supplied, outside the pharynx, by a branch from the .otic ganglion, which conducts to the muscle fibres which origin- ally come from the inferior maxillary division of the fifth. The palatoglossus and the palato-pharyngeus m all proba- bility receive their nerve-supply from the pharyngeal branches of the vagus. The Tonsils are two prominent rounded bodies, placed one on each side of the fauces immediately above the base of the tongue and between the two pillars of the soft palate. The buccal or internal surface of the tonsil is perforated by a number of orifices which lead into crypts or recesses in its substance; its external surface rests upon the superior constrictor muscle. The tonsils have a rich blood supply. They derive arterial twigs from the tonsillar and inferior palatine branches of the facial, the descending palatine branch

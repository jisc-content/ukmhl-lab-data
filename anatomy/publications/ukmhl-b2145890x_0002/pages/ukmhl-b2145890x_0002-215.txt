197 PAROTID REGION. strated, the latter may be turned up so as to expose the facial artery passing upwards upon the jaw. The Facial Branches of the Great Auricular Nerve must next be traced. Several small filaments from these will be seen to penetrate the parotid gland, for the purpose of joining the facial nerve. Others pro- ceed forwards, and supply the skin over the parotid, masseteric, and buccal regions. The Parotid Gland now demands the attention of the dissector. In defining this structure, the greatest care must be taken not to injure the branches of the facial nerve and the transverse facial artery, as they emerge from its substance, along its upper and anterior borders. The duct also, which appears at its anterior border, must be followed forwards upon the masseter muscle. When the superficial relations of the parotid have been examined, the gland-substance must be removed piece-meal, so as to bring into view the vari- ous structures with which its deep surface is in contact, and at the same time expose the blood-vessels and nerves which transverse it. This can best be effected by tracing into it the branches of the facial nerve, and the trunk of the transverse facial artery. Care must be taken not to injure the auriculotem- poral nerve, which ascends under cover of the upper part of its posterior border. The communicating twigs from the auriculotemporal, and great auricular nerves to the facial nerve, must be preserved. By this dissec- tion the termination of the external carotid artery and the temporo-maxillary vein will be displayed.

In searching for the posterior auricular nerve, the dissector will, in all probability, meet with the mastoid branch of the great auricular nerve, ascending upon the mastoid process on a more superficial plane. The small occipital nerve will be discovered midway between the ear and the external occipital protuber- ance. It supplies numerous branches to the integu- ment, and furnishes an auricular twig to the skin over the upper part of the cranial aspect of the ear; further, it communicates with the great auricular nerve on the one hand, and with the great occipital nerve on the other. The great occipital is a very large nerve, and there will be little difficulty experienced in finding it, as it lies close to the occipital artery, a short distance external to the occipital protuberance. Its branches spread out over the back of the head, and supply a wide area of integument. It sends an auricular twig to the skin over the cranial aspect of the ear, and communicates with the small occipital.

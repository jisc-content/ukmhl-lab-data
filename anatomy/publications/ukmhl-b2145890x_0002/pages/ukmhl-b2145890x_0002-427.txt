409 MEATUSES OF THE NOSE. tears to the nasal fossa (Fig. 47). To bring it into view, remove a small portion of the anterior part of the inferior turbinated bone with the scissors. This orifice varies in form, according to the manner in which the mucous membrane is arranged around it. Sometimes it is wide, patent, and circular ; at other times the mucous membrane is prolonged inwards beyond the bony opening, so as to reduce the size of the aperture and even give it a slit-like character. In some cases indeed the orifice may be so minute that it is a difficult matter to find it Its continuity with the lachrymal sac should in all cases be estab- lished by passing a probe from above downwards through the nasal duct. A fourth meatus is very frequently present on the outer wall of the nose. It is not at all uncommon to find the superior turbinated bone partially subdivided into an upper and lower part by a short fissure, which proceeds forwards from the anterior aspect of the body of the sphenoid. This additional meatus is termed the recessus spheno-ethmoidalis (Meyer), and into its back part opens the aperture of the sphen- oidal air-sinus (Fig. 46, 11). This orifice may be circular or slit-like, according to the manner in which the mucous membrane is disposed around it* The upper portion of the superior turbinated bone which is placed above this additional meatus is called the concha suprema (Fig. 46, 10). * Wh en the recessus spheno-ethmoidalis is absent, the sphenoidal air-sinus opens into the interval between the roof of the nasal fossa and the superior turbinated bone.

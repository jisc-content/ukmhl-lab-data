175 COMMON CAROTID ARTERY. be displayed at present, but will be examined in a subsequent dissection. (2.) Each of the four cervical nerves which form the plexus, receives a communica- ting filament from the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. (3.) Communications are effected indirectly in two places by the second, third, and fourth nerves with the spinal accessory—viz., in the substance of the sterno-mastoid by the twig from the second nerve to this muscle, and again on the under surface of the trapezius by the branches which go to this muscle from the third and fourth nerves. Common Carotid Artery.—The common carotid is the great artery of supply to the head and neck. Its origin is different on the two sides of the body. On the right side, it springs with the subclavian from the innominate artery behind the upper part of the sterno-clavicular articulation ; on the left side, it arises within the thorax, from the transverse part of the aortic arch. In both cases the common carotid- ends (as a rule) opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, by dividing into the external and internal carotid branches, and in both cases the course which it pursues in neck, and the relations which it exhibits, are so much alike that one description will suffice. The course of the common carotid is slightly oblique, and may be marked on the surface by drawing a line from the sterno-clavicular articulation to a point midway between the lower jaw and the mastoid process. At the root of the neck the two vessels are

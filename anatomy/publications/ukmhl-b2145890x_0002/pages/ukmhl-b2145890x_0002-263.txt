THE TEMPORAL MUSCLE. 245 of the lower jaw. The fleshy origin of the deep portion of the masseter from the inner surface of the zygomatic arch can now be seen, and frequently the dissection is complicated by a number of fibres from the temporal muscle, joining this part of the masseter. In turning the masseter down, great care must be taken not to injure its nerve and artery of supply. These pass outwards through the sigmoid notch, between the neck of the lower jaw and the posterior margin of the temporal muscle. When they are exposed and cleaned, they must be divided in order that the muscle may be fully reflected. On no account detach the masseter from the angle of the jaw. The temporal muscle may now be cleaned. The Temporal Muscle is fan-shaped. It arises from the entire extent of the temporal fossa by an origin reaching upwards as high as the lower of the two lines which constitute the temporal ridge, and downwards as low as the zygomatic crest of the great wing of the sphenoid. It also receives additional fibres from the deep surface of the temporal fascia which covers it. From this broad origin the fasciculi of the temporal muscle converge towards the coronoid process of the lower jaw; the anterior fibres descend vertically, the posterior fibres at first pursue a nearly horizontal course, whilst the inter- mediate fasciculi proceed with varying degrees of obliquity. As it approaches its insertion, a tendon is developed upon its superficial aspect, and this is inserted into, the summit and anterior edge of the

233 EYELIDS. similar connections, being continuous on the one hand with the lower margin of the tarsal plate, and on the other with the periosteum of the face and the floor of the orbit Towards the inner canthus, where the eyelids are supported by the tendo oculi, the palpebral ligaments become thin and delicate. The tarsal ligaments should in the next place be examined. The palpebral ligaments fix the tarsi to the upper and lower margins of the orbit; the tarsal ligaments attach the tarsi to the outer and inner orbital margins. The external tarsal ligament is a narrow band of no great strength, which springs from the malar bone where this forms the outer margin of the orbit and proceeds inwards. At the outer canthus, it divides into two pieces, an upper and a lower, which are attached to the tarsal plates. This ligament is to be regarded as being merely a thickening of the palpebral ligaments where these become continuous with each other at the outer margin of the orbit. The internal tarsal ligament, or the tendo oculi, is a much more important structure. It has a double function to performâ€”viz., (1.) to serve as a tendon of origin for the orbicularis muscle, and (2.) to fix the tarsi to the inner margin of the orbit. To obtain a satisfactory view of it, the muscular fibres which spring from its upper and lower margins must be completely removed. The tendo oculi is a strong fibrous band which springs from the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone immediately in front of the lachrymal groove; passing

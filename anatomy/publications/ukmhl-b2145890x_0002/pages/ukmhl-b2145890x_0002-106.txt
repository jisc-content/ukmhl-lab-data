go HEAD AND NECK. lower dorsal regions it shows marked swellings, termed respectively the cervical and lumbar enlarge- ments. From these expansions proceed the nerves which supply the upper and lower limbs. The cervical swelling is the more evident of the two, and its greatest diameter will be noticed opposite the fifth or sixth cervical vertebra. Below, it subsides at the level of the second dorsal vertebra, whilst above it extends as high as the foramen magnum. The lumbar swelling is largest opposite the twelfth dorsal vertebra, whilst it first becomes evident at the tenth dorsal vertebra. Filum Terminate.â€”This delicate thread-like fila- ment lies amidst the numerous long nerve-roots which occupy the lower part of the spinal canal, and it can readily be detected from these (i.) by its glisten- ing appearance, and (2.) from its proceeding from the extremity of the conus medullaris. Although the central canal of the spinal cord is prolonged down its interior for nearly half its length, the filum terminale is chiefly composed of pia mater carried downwards from the conus medullaris. The linea splendens and the lower ends of the hgamenta denticulata may be considered to be continued into it Towards the upper part of the sacral canal it pierces the dura mater, and receives an investment from it, and, finally, reaching the lower end of the sacral canal, it terminates by blending with the peri- osteum on the back of the coccyx or last piece of the sacrum.

I06 HEAD AND NECK. themselves into ascending, transverse and descending branches. The ascending branches are two in number, and both have already been examined in the superficial dissection of the back of the neck (p. 45)- They are 0) the small occipital--Fig, 16 (8),—springing from the second cervical nerve, and (b) the great auricular —Fig. 16 (9)—which takes origin from the second and third cervical nerves. The transverse branches proceed from a single nerve called the superficial cervical nerve—Fig. 16 (i i). This arises from the second and third cervical nerves, and winding round the posterior border of the sterno- mastoid about its middle, proceeds transversely for- wards upon the deep fascia to reach the area over the anterior triangle of the neck. Here it divides into two branches, of which one inclines upwards and the other downwards. The upper branch communicates freely with the infra-maxillary division of the portio dura, and, piercing the platysma, supplies the skin as high as the base of the lower jaw. The lower branch also perforates the platysma, and its filaments may be traced as low as the sternum. The descending branches take origin by a single large trunk from the third and fourth cervical nerves. This emerges from under the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and soon breaks up into several twigs, which pierce the deep fascia and spread out widely from each other as they descend over the lower part of the posterior triangle, under cover of the platysma. The ultimate distribution of these twigs, however, is

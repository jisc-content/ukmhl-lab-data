STRUCTURES IN THE INFERIOR DENTAL CANAL. 263 Otic Ganglion.—As this ganglion lies under cover of the inferior maxillary trunk, it cannot be satisfac- torily studied at this stage. It is true that it may be exposed by tracing the nerve to the internal ptery- goid muscle upwards, when it will be seen to be developed in connection with the root of this branch. Its connections, however, can only be made out by dissecting from the inside, and it is well to defer its examination until this can be done. Structures within the Inferior Dental Canal.— The student should now endeavour, by means of a Hey's saw, a chisel, and the bone-pliers, to remove the outer table of the lower jaw, and thus open up the inferior dental canal. This canal is traversed by the inferior dental artery and nerve. These give off twigs which enter the fangs of the molar and bicuspid teeth, and they terminate by dividing into a mental and incisor branch. The mental artery and nerve appear on the face through the mental foramen, and have already been examined; the incisor artery and nerve are carried forwards to the symphysis and send up twigs to the canine and incisor teeth. The vessel anastomoses in the bone with the corresponding artery of the opposite side.

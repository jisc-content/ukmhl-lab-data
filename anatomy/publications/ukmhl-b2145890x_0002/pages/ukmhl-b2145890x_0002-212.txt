I94 HEAD AND NECK, closed and the margins of the lids are in apposition with each other, the palpebral fissure is reduced to a nearly horizontal line, slightly higher internally than externally. Owing to the greater length and freer mobility of the upper lid, the fissure in this condition is placed below the level of the cornea. At the extremities of the palpebral fissure the eye- lids meet and form the palpebral commissures or canthi and at the inner canthus the fissure expands £ a small triangular space called the locus lackry- lalis. If the dissector now examine the free margms of the lids he will observe that to the outer side of 1 laeus lachrymahs they are flat and that in each case the eyelashes project from the -tenor bo der whilst the meibomian glands open along the posterior border-a distinct interval intervening between he HI a and the ^land-mouths.

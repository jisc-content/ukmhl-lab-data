125 TRIANGLES OF THE NECK. constitute a third or lower trunk. In the form of these three trunks the plexus passes behind the clavicle and enters the axilla. Here each trunk at once splits into an anterior and a posterior division. Raise the three anterior divisions on the handle of the knife, and then it will be seen that all the three posterior divisions unite to form the posterior cord of the plexus, and, further, that the innermost of these divisions is much smaller than the other two. Of the three anterior divisions the two outer join to con- stitute the outer cord, whilst the innermost is carried down by itself as the inner cord of the plexus. From the three cords of the brachial plexus are given off the branches which supply the upper limb. From the above description it will be seen that the plexus, from changes which are effected in the arrangement of its fibres, may be divided into four stages :â€” 1st Stage. 2nd Stage. 3rd Stage. 4th Stage. 5 separate nerves (viz., 4 lower cervical and first dorsal). 3 nervous trunks (viz., an upper, middle, and lower). 3 anterior divisions and 3 posterior divisions. 3 nervous cords (viz., an outer, inner, and a posterior). The two first of these stages are generally observed in the lower part of the posterior triangle, and the two last behind the clavicle and upper part of the axilla. It must be understood, however, that the points at

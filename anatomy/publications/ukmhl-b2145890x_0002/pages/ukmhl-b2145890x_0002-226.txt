HEAD AND NECK. 208 The outer or facial part is thinner than the labial portion and by its outer margin it blends with the numerous labial muscles which converge towards the aperture of the mouth. The fibres of these muscles therefore and more especially those of the buccinator form a very considerable part of its bulk. It like- wise presents slips of attachment to the maxillary bones and to the nasal septum. Thus in the upper lip there are four such bands, two being placed upon each side of the mesial- plane. They are termed (I.) the naso-labial bands, and (2.) the superior acces- sory bands. In the lower lip there is only one band on each sideâ€”viz., the inferior accessory. The naso-labial band is a rounded tapering bundle of muscular fibres which passes upwards and forwards to be attached to the septal cartilage of the nose. The characteristic vertical mesial furrow of the upper lip is in a measure due to the presence of these two muscular slips. The superior accessory bundle takes origin from the incisive foramen of the superior maxilla, whilst the inferior accessory bundle springs from the corresponding fossa of the lower jaw. They can be easily exposed by everting the lips and remov- ing the mucous membrane from the neighbourhood of these fossae. By this dissection two other small muscles will be displayed-(i.) the depressor alae nasi to the inner side of the superior accessory slip, and (2.) the levator menti to the inner side of the inferior accessory slip.

248 HEAD AND NECK. proceeds forwards upon the external pterygoid muscle. The nerves will also be observed to be placed in close relationship to the same muscle. Thus emerging from between the cranial wall and its upper border are the masseteric and the two deep temporal nerves; appearing from under cover of its lower border are the inferior dental and the lingual nerves ; whilst the anriculo- temporal nerve is related to it behind, and the long buccal in front. The former passes back- wards under cover of its insertion, and appears behind the temporo-maxillary joint, and the long buccal either pierces it or emerges from between its two heads of origin. The internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw will likewise be seen. It is the thin strip of membrane upon which the inferior dental nerve rests. The External Pterygoid Muscle arises in the zygomatic fossa by two heads, an upper and a lower. The upper head springs from the infra-temporal ridge and the zygomatic surface of the great wing of the sphenoid ; the lower head takes origin from the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate. As the muscle passes backwards it diminishes somewhat, and is inserted into the fore part of the neck of the lower jaw, and also into the anterior margin of the inter-articular fibro-cartilage of the temporo-maxillary articulation. The Internal Pterygoid Muscle is also bicipital at its origin, its two heads embracing the origin of the

58 HEAD AND NECK. Erector Spinse—Under this name we include a series of muscular strands which stretch with a greater or less degree of continuity along the entire length of the dorsal aspect of the spinal column. In the lumbar region it constitutes a bulky fleshy mass which may be considered the starting point. This bulky mass sends a pointed process downwards on the back of the sacrum, and has the following origin :— (i.) from the spines of the lower two dorsal, all the lumbar and all the sacral vertebrae; (2.) from the supra-spinous ligaments which bind the lumbar and dorsal spines together; (3.) from the back of the sacrum and from the posterior sacro-coccygeal liga- ment ; (4.) from the posterior fifth of the iliac crest. In great part the superficial surface of this muscular mass is covered by a very dense tendon, which in its lower part becomes blended, as we have already noted, with the superficial lamella of the lumbar fascia. As the erector spinse is followed upwards it is seen to divide into three columns. The outer column first separates from the general mass, and to it the name of sacro-lumbalis or ilio-costalis is given ; the middle column is termed the lo.ngissimus dorsi ; and the inner column, which only becomes quite distinct as we approach the upper part of the dorsal region, is called the spinalis dorsi. Sacro-lumbalis.—The inter-muscular interval be- tween this muscle and the longissimus dorsi becomes apparent about the level of the last rib. The separa-

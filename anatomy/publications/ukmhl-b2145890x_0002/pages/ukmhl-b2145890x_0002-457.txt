439 THE ARYTENOID MUSCLE. this upward and outward course, the fibres run" with different degrees of obliquity. The uppermost fibres are short and nearly horizontal; the intermediate fibres are the longest and are very oblique ; whilst the lowest fibres are almost vertical in their direction. The Arytenoid Muscle consists of two portions ; a superficial part termed the arytenoideus obliquus, and a deeper layer called the arytenoideus trans- versa. The arytenoideus obliquus is composed of two bundles of muscular fibres, each of which springs from the posterior aspect of the outer angle of the base of the corresponding arytenoid cartilage. From these points the two fleshy slips proceed upwards and inwards, and cross each other in the mesial plane like the limbs of the letter X- Reaching the summit of the arytenoid cartilage on each side some of the fibres are inserted into it, but the greater proportion are pro- longed round the base of the cartilage of Santorini into the aryteno-epiglottidean fold. Here they receive the name of the aryteno-epiglottidean muscle, and as they approach the epiglottis they are joined by the fibres of the thyro-epiglottidean muscle. The oblique arytenoid muscles may therefore be considered as constituting a weak sphincter muscle for the superior aperture of the larynx. Each bundle starting from the base of one of the arytenoid cartilages, is prolonged into the aryteno-epiglottidean fold of the opposite side, and along this to the margin of the epiglottis. The arytenoideus transversus is an unpaired muscle.

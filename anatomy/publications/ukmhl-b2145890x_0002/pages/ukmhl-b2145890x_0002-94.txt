78 HEAD AND NECK. of the inferior curved line and the surface immedi- ately below. The Rectus Capitis Posticus Minor is a minute fan-shaped muscle, placed to the inner side and upon a deeper plane than the preceding muscle. It takes origin from the tubercle on the posterior arch of the atlas, and is inserted into the inner part of the inferior curved line of the occipital bone and the surface between this and the foramen magnum. The Obliquus Capitis Inferior stretches from the bifid spine of the axis, from the extremity of which it takes origin, to the posterior tubercle of the trans- verse process of the atlas. The great occipital nerve will be seen hooking round its lower border. The Obliquus Capitis Superior springs from the posterior tubercle of the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the occipital bone in the interval between the curved lines and to the outer side of the complexus. Sub-occipital Nerveâ€”The posterior division of the sub-occipital nerve does not divide into an external and internal branch. It is also peculiar in the manner in which it leaves the spinal canal. It enters the sub-occipital triangle by passing back- wards between the posterior arch of the atlas, and the vertebral artery ; so that even in cases where all its branches have been divided, the trunk is readily- found on account of these precise relations. The sub-occipital nerve at once breaks up into branches

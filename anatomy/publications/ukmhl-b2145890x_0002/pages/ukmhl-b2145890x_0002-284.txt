HEAD AND NECK. 266 inserted into body of the hyoid bone ; these, however, form a comparatively small part of the muscle. The greater number of the fibres are inserted into a median raphe, which extends between the symphysis of the lower jaw and the body of the hyoid bone. The two mylo-hyoid muscles, therefore, in front of the hyoid bone stretch across from one side of the body of the jaw to the other, and constitute a floor for the anterior part of the mouth. This floor is frequently termed the diaphragma oris. The mylo-hyoid muscle is supplied by the mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior dental nerve. Dissection.â€”The mylo-hyoid muscle must now be reflected, in order that the parts subjacent to it may be brought into view. As these parts lie in a great measure under shelter of the lower jaw, it is ad- vantageous to make at the same time a section of this bone, in order that it may be turned upwards. Carefully divide the fibres of the mylo-hyoid close to the ridge from which it arises. A very small piece may be left attached to the lower jaw to serve as a landmark in the future dissection. This must be done very cautiously, else the mucous membrane of the mouth will be injured. When detached from the jaw, the muscle must next be separated from the median raphe, and then it can be thrown down over the hyoid bone. The lower jaw should next be divided, by means of the saw and bone-pliers, a quarter of an inch to the outer side of the symphysis. When the section is completed, the lower margin of

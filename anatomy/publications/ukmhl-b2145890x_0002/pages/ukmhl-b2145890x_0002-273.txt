REFLECTION OF EXTERNAL PTERYGOID. 255 below, it is concave, and fits upon the upper aspect of the condyle of the jaw. In the centre, it is thin, and in some cases may be seen to be perforated; its circumference, more especially posteriorly, is thick. It should also be noted that it is but loosely attached by its periphery to the external lateral ligament, but that anteriorly the external pterygoid muscle is partly inserted into it. The synovial membrane, which lines the upper cavity of the joint, is of greater extent and looser than that which lines the lower compartment. This is owing to the articular surface of the temporal bone being of larger size than the condylar surface. Reflection of External Pterygoid.â€”The head of the lower jaw should now be disarticulated and thrown forwards with the attached external pterygoid muscle. It is well to detach the inter-articular fibro- cartilage with the head of the bone, in order that it may be more thoroughly examined. Great care must be taken not to injure the auriculo-temporal nerve, which passes backwards in close proximity to the deep aspect of the joint. When the disarticulation is complete, the muscle may be turned forwards by gently insinuating the head of the jaw under the internal maxillary artery. The reflection of the external pterygoid muscle brings into view, after a little dissection, the infra- maxillary division of the fifth cranial nerve, emerging from the foramen ovale, and breaking up into its branches of distribution.

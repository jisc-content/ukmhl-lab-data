411 NERVES OF THE NASAL FOSSA. so numerous that the mucous membrane assumes the character of cavernous tissue, and is some- times spoken of as the " erectile body." When turgid with blood, it swells out so as to obliterate the interval between the turbinal bone and the septum. The mucous membrane of the floor, meatuses, and the atrium, is smoother and not so thick as that over the turbinated bones. Everywhere numerous racemose glands are embedded in its midst, and the minute punctiform orifices of the ducts are visible to the naked eye. In the olfactory region the lining mem- brane of the nose in the fresh state is of a yellowish colour, and is softer and more delicate than in the respiratory part. The great vascularity of the mucous membrane of the nose, is doubtless for the purpose of raising the temperature of the inspired air. Nerves and Vessels on the Outer Wall of the Nasal Fossa:â€” Nerves of Smell, . Olfactory nerves. (1.) External branch of nasal proper. (2.) Nasal branch of anterior superior dental. j (3.) Superior nasal branches from mon Sensation, ] Meckel's ganglion and the Vid- ian nerve. (4.) Two inferior nasal branches from the anterior palatine nerve. The olfactory nerves are from twelve to twenty in number. They are fine filaments which spring from the under surface and the extremity of the olfactory Nerves of Com-

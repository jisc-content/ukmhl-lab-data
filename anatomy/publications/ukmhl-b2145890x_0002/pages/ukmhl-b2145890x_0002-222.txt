204 HEAD AND NECK* The middle temporal arises immediately above the zygoma, and it pierces the temporal fascia to reach the temporal muscle, and communicate with the deep temporal branches of the internal maxillary artery. The orbital artery is an inconstant branch which runs forwards above the zygoma to supply the outer part of the orbicularis palpebrarum, and the skin in this neighbourhood. Muscles of the Face.—The muscles of the face are arranged in three groups-viz., (i.) palpebral and superciliary ; (2.) oral; (3.) nasal. Each of these groups may be examined in turn. It is convenient to begin with the palpebral and superciliary muscles. These are three in number :— 1. Orbicularis palpebrarum. 2. Tensor tarsi (Horner's muscle). . 3. Corrugator supercilii. The upper eyelid has a special elevator, termed the levator palpebral superioris, but this muscle is contained within the orbital cavity, and does not come under the notice of the dissector at the present stage. The examination of the tensor tarsi must also be deferred until the eyelids are dissected. If the eyelids be drawn outwards, a prominent cord-like ligament becomes apparent on the inner side of the inner canthus. This extends outwards from the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone to reach the eyelids, and it is termed the Undo ocuh

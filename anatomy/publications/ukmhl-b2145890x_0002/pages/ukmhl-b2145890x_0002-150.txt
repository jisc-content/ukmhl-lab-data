Its base is above and consti- tuted by the body of the lower-jaw, and a line drawn backwards from the angle of the jaw to the sterno- mastoid; its apex points downwards, and is formed by the intermediate tendon of the digastric. Contents of the Anterior Triangle. - The numerous and diverse structures contained within the anterior triangle must now be displayed. This is a dissection which requires care and some preliminary knowledge of the parts to be exposed. The student is therefore advised to read the following general account before undertaking the work. The dissection should be carried out over the entire area at once and the structures found in one sub-division followed upwards and downwards, as the case may be, into the other sub-divisions of the space. It is a common fault with dissectors to fail to open up the digastric triangle until the two lower triangles have been ful y dissected. Two small nerves are especially liable to injury, and therefore should be secured as early as possible They are the thyro-hyoid branch of the hypo- glossal and the external laryngeal nerve. The hypo- glossal nerve, which will be found crossing the carotid triangle along the lower border of the posterior belly of the digastric, should be traced forwards; as it approaches the hyoid bone, its minute thyro-hymd branch will be discovered. To expose the external laryngeal nerve all that is necessary is to separate the omohyoid from the sterno-hyoid muscle wherethese he

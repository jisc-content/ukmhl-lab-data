267 SUBMAXILLARY REGION. the jaw should be gently tilted upwards, and some means taken to retain the loose piece of the bone in this position. Under no pretence whatever should it be removed, and great care must be taken to preserve intact the mucous membrane of the mouth passing to the deep surface of the gum. Parts Exposed by the Reflection of the Mylo-Hyoid.â€”The side of the tongue is now brought into view, with a number of structures in connection with it. First note the mucous membrane stretching from the tongue to the gum of the lower jaw; then identify the various muscles. The hyo- glossus, a portion of which was previously visible behind the mylo-hyoid, is fully exposed. It is a square sheet of fleshy fibres which extends from the hyoid bone to the side of the tongue. Mark well its position, because all the structures in this region have a more or less intimate relationship to it. Thus behind it, will be recognised the stylo-glossns muscle, and in front of it, the genio-hyo-glossus and the genio-hyoid. The last muscle occupies the fore part of the region, whilst the anterior part of the genio-hyo-glossus is seen in the interval between it and the hyo-glossus. Upon the surface of the hyo-glossus, the lingual and hypoglossal nerves, the deep portion of the sub- maxillary gland with its duct, and the submaxillary ganglion are to be dissected. The lingual nerve occupies the highest level, and passes forward upon the muscle near its insertion into the tongue. The hypoglossal, accompanied by the ranine vein, crosses it close to

333 THE RECTI MUSCLES. where its origin becomes continuous with that of the superior rectus. Through the archway which intervenes between the two heads of the external rectus pass the two divisions of the third nerve, the nasal nerve, the sixth nerve, and the ophthalmic veins. When the ocular surfaces {i.e., the surfaces turned towards the optic foramen) of these muscles are exa- mined, they will be seen to arise in a great measure from two common tendons which, from their position and connections, may be termed the superior and inferior common tendons of the recti muscles. The superior common tendon (Lockwood) springs from the upper and outer margin of the optic foramen, and gives origin to the superior rectus, the internal rectus, and the upper head of the external rectus. The inferior common tendon, more usually known as the " Ligament of Zinn," arises from a distinct depression upon the lower and outer aspect of the margin of the optic foramen, and divides into three slips, which go to the internal rectus, the inferior rectus, and the lower head of the external rectus. The slips, from the two common tendons which go to the external rectus become continuous with each other, forming in this way the tendinous arch referred to. A better view of these attachments may be obtained by dividing the optic nerve close to the optic foramen and turning forwards the eyeball. The manner in which the recti muscles are inserted into the eyeball should next be studied. Each ends in a delicate membranous tendon, which is inserted

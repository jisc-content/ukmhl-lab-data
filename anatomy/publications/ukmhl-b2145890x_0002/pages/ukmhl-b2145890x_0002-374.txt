356 HEAD AND NECK. The Atlantoaxial Capsular Ligaments can be examined from the outside. They are somewhat lax, and on removing the outer part of each, the joint cavities will be opened into (Fig. 40). The Anterior Occipito-atlantal Ligament (Figs. 39, f) extends from the upper border of the anterior arch of the atlas to the under surface of the basilar process of the occipital bone in front of the foramen magnum. On each side of the mesial plane it is thin and membranous, and stretches outwards so as to abut against the capsular ligament. In the middle line there is an exceedingly strong cord-like band which stands out in strong relief from the rest of the ligament, and is carried downwards to the anterior tubercle of the atlas. Part of its fibres are attached to this, but a certain proportion become con- tinuous with the central thickening of the anterior atlanto-axial ligament, and through this, with the anterior common ligament of the spine. The Posterior Occipito-atlantal Ligament is a thin and weak membrane which occupies the wide CTap between the posterior arch of the atlas and the posterior border of the foramen magnum, to both of which it is attached. It is very firmly connected with the dura mater, and is so feebly developed that it is a matter of some difficulty to show it as a distinct layer after the latter has been removed. On each side it reaches the capsular ligament. Over each of the grooves on the posterior arch of the atlas for the

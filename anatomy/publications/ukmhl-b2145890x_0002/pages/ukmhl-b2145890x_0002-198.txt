In the study of this vessel, the dissector will perceive that it can very conveniently be divided into three sta-es corresponding to three marked changes in the relations which it presents. The first stage is contained within the carotid triangle. It is therefore, com- paratively speaking, superficial. Here it is overlapped by the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, covered by the platysma, fasciae, and integument, and crossed by the lingual and common facial veins as they run towards the internal jugular. The second stage is more deeply placed. It is crossed by the posterior belly of the digastric, the stylo-hyoid muscle, and by the hypo-glossal nerve. The third stage is in relation to the parotid gland. Emerging from under cover of the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, the artery ascends for a short distance under cover of the lower part of the parotid gland, and then sinks into its substance, in which it remains for the remainder of its course Whilst in the parotid gland, the external carotid artery is crossed near its termination by the portio dura nerve, whilst the temporo-maxillary vein passes downwards superficial to it* * These relations cannot be seen at present, but they will afterwards inesereiauo be noted that whUe be ^^£j^£££% much nearer its deep than its tE urfac ed frozen sections through the parotid region T^ittS eaSy only a very small part of the terminal portion show that it is £ ' > ^ he ]and> Beiow this it merely t^^o^C^-ofaeland, ,Fig. ,8, „ so...

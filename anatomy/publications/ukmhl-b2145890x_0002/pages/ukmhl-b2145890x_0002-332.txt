314 HEAD AND NECK. to join the large deep petrosal nerve from the carotid plexus. The trunk formed by the union of these two filaments is the Vidian nerve. The Small Superficial Petrosal Nerve appears upon the anterior face of the petrous bone through an aperture which is placed immediately external to the hiatus Fallopii. It leaves the cranial cavity by passing downwards between the great wing of the sphenoid, and the petrous part of the temporal bone to reach the otic ganglion. This minute nerve, as has already been mentioned (p. 291), is formed by the union of the tympanic branch of the glosso-pharyngeal with a branch from the geniculate ganglion of the facial. External Superficial Petrosal Nerve—It is conveni- ent at this stage, to take note of a third petrosal nerve—the external superficial petrosal. It takes origin from the sympa- thetic plexus, which accompanies the middle meningeal artery, and entering the petrous bone, is conducted to the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. Middle and Small Meningeal Arteries—The entrance of the middle meningeal artery through the foramen spinosum should now be examined. It gives minute twigs to the Gasserian ganglion, and one—the petrosal artery—which accompanies the great super- ficial petrosal nerve into the hiatus Fallopii. The farther course of the middle meningeal artery has already been described (pp. 38 and 256). The small recurrent branch of the inferior maxillary division of the fifth nerve also enters the cranium through the foramen spinosum (p. 258). The small meningeal artery enters the cranium through the foramen ovale, and is chiefly distributed to the Gasserian ganglion.

56 HEAD AND NECK. seen. Note, however, that whilst the main attach- ment of this lamella is to the apices of the transverse processes, it also extends inwards between them and is attached to their contiguous margins. The next step consists in dividing the middle lamella longitudi- nally close to its vertebral attachment. The quad- ratus lumborum is then brought into view, and gently raising the middle lamella from its surface until its outer border is exposed, the whole muscle should be pushed inwards. This brings into view the third or anterior lamella of the lumbar fascia,, and its junction on the one hand with the middle lamella, and on the other with the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae close to the roots of the transverse processes, can be readily made out. The lumbar fascia, therefore, is formed at the outer borders of the erector spinae and quadratus lumborum muscles by the union of these three lamellae. Sup- eriorly, it is attached to the last rib; inferiorly, it is fixed to the crest of the ilium ; whilst externally it is continued into the transversalis abdominis muscle, of which it may be considered to be the posterior aponeurosis. By its superficial surface it gives origin to fibres of the internal oblique muscle of the abdo- minal wall. Splenius Muscleâ€”The serratus posticus superior must be divided close to its origin from the vertebral spines, and turned outwards in order that the splenius muscle may be fully displayed. The splenius has a continuous origin from rather

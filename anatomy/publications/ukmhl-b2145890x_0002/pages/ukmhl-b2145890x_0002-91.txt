DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 75 process, and is inserted into the outer surface of the rib immediately below, along a line extending from the tubercle to the angle. Posterior Primary Divisions of the Sacral Nerves.â€”The dissector should now endeavour to trace out these minute nervous twigs. To expose the first three the multifidus spinae muscle covering the upper three sacral apertures must be carefully removed. Each of these three nerves will be found to divide in the usual manner into an internal and external branch. The internal branches are very fine, and end in the multifidus spinae. The external branches are somewhat larger, and join together so as to form a looped plexus upon the back of the sacrum. This communicates above with the external branch of the last lumbar nerve and below with the posterior division of the fourth sacral nerve. Branches proceed from the loops thus formed to the surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, and then become superficial to supply a limited area of skin over the gluteal region. They have already been noticed in this distribution by the dissector of the lower limb. The last two posterior primary divisions of the sacral nerves do not exhibit the usual division into external and internal branches. They are very small, and, after communicating with each other, and also with the coccygeal nerve, they distribute filaments to, the parts on the back of the lower

INTERIOR OF THE LARYNX. 431 somewhat flaccid, and present a free border which is slightly arched—the concavity looking downwards. The interval between the false vocal cords is some- times termed the false glottis, and is considerably wider than that between the true vocal cords. It follows from this, that when the cavity of the larynx is examined from above, the four cords are distinctly visible, but when examined from below the true cords alone can be seen. The true vocal cords are placed immediately below the false cords, and are straight, sharp, and prominent. The mucous membrane which is stretched over them is so thin, that the yellowish colour of the elastic ligaments which support them can readily be dis- cerned. In section each true vocal cord is somewhat prismatic in form, and the free border looks upwards. The true vocal cords are the agents by means of which the voice is produced. The false vocal cords are of little importance in this respect; indeed, they can in great part be destroyed, and no appreciable difference in the voice result. The rima glottidis is the elongated fissure by means of which the middle compartment of the larynx communicates with the lower subdivision. It is placed somewhat below the middle of the laryngeal cavity, of which it constitutes the narrowest part. In front it corresponds to the interval between the true vocal cords; behind it corresponds to the interval between the bases and vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages. It is composed, therefore, of two very distinct parts—(1.) a narrow anterior portion, between

DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 61 the two muscles have been described under the names of transversalis cervicis and capitis. In addition to its dorsal origin, however, it also draws three or four slips from the articular processes of a like number of the lower cervical vertebrae. The narrow fleshy band which results is inserted into the back part of the mastoid process, under cover of the splenius capitis and sterno-mastoid muscles. Spinalis Dorsi.—This, the innermost, shortest, and weakest of the three columns, is in some respects the most difficult to define. Below, it is intimately- blended with the longissimus dorsi, but it may be regarded as taking origin • by four tendons from the spines of the two upper lumbar and two lower dorsal vertebrae. These, by their union, form a small muscle, which is inserted by a series of slips into a very variable number of the upper dorsal spines. It is closely connected with the subjacent semi-spinalis dorsi. Occipital Artery.—This vessel has already been observed crossing the apex of the posterior triangle (P- 49)> and its terminal branches have been dissected as they ramify in the scalp (p. 12). The second part of the vessel, which extends from under shelter of the mastoid process, along the superior curved line of the occipital bone, to the point where it pierces the trapezius to become superficial, can now be fully exposed. To effect this, the trachelo-mastoid must be divided a short distance below its insertion, and

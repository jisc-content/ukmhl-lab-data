Within the orbital cavity we find grouped around the eyeball and the optic nerve the following structures :— Rectus superior. Rectus inferior. Rectus externus. Muscles, . <( Rectus internus. Obliquus superior. Obliquus inferior. Levator palpebral superior. Vessels, i Ophthalmic artery and its branches. Ophthalmic veins (superior and inferior) with their tributaries. Occulo-motor (3rd).

Lenticular ganglion. Lachrymal gland. The capsule of Tenon. Dissection.—The roof of the orbit must be removed. To effect this, two saw-cuts are required : (1.)

243 MASSETER. In the upper part of its extent, the temporal fascia is comparatively thin, and the fibres of the subjacent muscle may be seen shining through it; below it is thicker, and owing to the fat which is inter- posed between its laminae, it becomes perfectly opaque. Masseter.—This muscle must now be thoroughly cleaned. To do this effectually, it will be necessary to divide the trunk of the facial nerve immediately beyond the point where it gives off the branches to the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, and throw it forwards with the various branches which spring from it towards the buccal region. The traizsverse facial artery must be likewise turned backwards. The dissector will recollect that he has previously removed from the surface of the masseter a forward prolon- gation of the parotid gland, the socia parotidis, Stenson's duct, twigs from the great auricular nerve, scattered fibres of the platysma, and the origin of the risorius muscle. The masseter is a massive quadrate muscle which lies upon the ascending ramus of the lower jaw. Its fibres are arranged in two sets—a superficial and a deep. The superficial part of the muscle arises from anterior two-thirds of the lower border of the zygo- matic arch, and its fasciculi are directed downwards and backwards ; the deep part springs from the whole length of the inner aspect of the zygomatic arch, and also from the posterior third of its lower border. Its fibres proceed downwards and forwards. The only

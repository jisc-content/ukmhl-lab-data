HEAD AND NECK. 392 jaw in front of the antrum of Highmore. The dissector should endeavour to open up this canal with the chisel. After supplying a branch to the mucous membrane of the lower and fore part of the nasal fossa, the anterior superior dental nerve divides into branches for the incisor and the canine teeth. While traversing the upper jaw, the three superior dental branches communicate with each other and form two nerve- loops. Numerous twigs proceed from these, and join in a fine plexus. It is from this plexus that the terminal filaments to the teeth and gum take origin. The Infra-orbital Artery is a branch of the internal maxillary. It arises in the sphenomaxillary fossa, and accompanies the infra-orbital nerve. In the face its terminal twigs anastomose with branches of the facial, transverse facial, and buccal arteries ; in the infra-orbital canal it gives some fine branches to the contents of the orbital cavity, and also the anterior dental artery which accompanies the nerve of that name, and supplies the incisor and canine teeth, and the lining membrane of the antrum. The infra-orbital vein joins the pterygoid plexus. OTIC GANGLION-NASAL FOSS^J- MECKEL'S GANGLION.

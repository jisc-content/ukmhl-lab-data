TRIANGLES OF THE NECK. 129 Boundaries and Sub-Divisions.—The anterior triangle differs from the posterior triangle in having its base above and its apex below. Behind it is bounded by the anterior margin of the sterno- mastoid ; in front by the middle line of the neck. Its base is formed by the body of the lower jaw, and a line drawn from the angle of the inferior maxilla to the sterno-mastoid muscle, whilst its dependent apex is constituted by the meeting of its anterior and posterior limits at the upper border of the sternum. The space thus mapped out, however, is sub-divided into three smaller triangles, by three muscles which traverse it in different directions. These muscles are:—(1.) the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid; (2.) the digastric ; and (3.) the stylo-hyoid. It is well, therefore, at this stage to define these muscles, and accurately determine the precise position and extent of each sub-division of the space. In the first instance, merely clean the superficial surface of the muscles. In the case of the omo-hyoid, be careful not to injure the twigs from the descendens noni nerve, which enter its upper border, and, whilst dealing with the digastric, bear in mind that the facial vein, and the anterior division of the temporo-maxillary vein, usually descend superficial to its posterior belly, and must be dissected out before the muscle is touched. The filaments from the mylo-hyoid nerve, which enter the upper border of its anterior belly, are not liable to injury if ordinary caution be exercised. The anterior belly of the omo-hyoid appears by emerging from under cover of the anterior border of PART III. K

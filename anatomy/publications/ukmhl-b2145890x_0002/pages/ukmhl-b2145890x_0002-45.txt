CRANIAL NERVES. 31 The fifth or trifacial nerve—Fig. 7 (6)—is com- posed of two parts—viz., a large, soft, sensory portion, consisting of loosely connected funiculi, and a small, firmer motor portion, which lies upon the inner surface of the sensory part. They can generally be easily distinguished, and both pierce the dura mater at the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and under the anterior extremity of the tentorium. The sixth or abducent nerve—Fig. 7 (10)—is a small, round nerve, which disappears through the dura mater at the lower and outer part of the dorsum sellae, and enters the inner wall of the cavernous sinus. The seventh nerve is composed of three parts—viz., the portio mollis, or auditory, the portio dura, ox facial, and the small pars intermedia. They all enter the internal auditory meatus, where the pars intermedia joins the facial nerve. The eighth nerve also consists of three divisions— viz., the glossopharyngeal, the pneumogastric or vagus, and the spinal accessory. They pierce, the dura mater over the internal jugular foramen in the order in which they have been named, from before backwards. The glossopharyngeal has a separate aperture of exit in the dura mater, and therefore receives a separate sheath of dura mater, whilst the vagus and spinal accessory have a common aperture, and a common sheath of both arachnoid and dura mater. They all leave the skull through the middle compartment of the jugular fossa. The spinal accessory has already been noticed ascending from the spinal canal.

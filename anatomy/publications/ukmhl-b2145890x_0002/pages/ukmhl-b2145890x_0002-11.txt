PREFACE. A VARIETY of circumstances have combined to delay the appearance of this volume. It was commenced four years ago, but it has repeatedly been laid aside as more important duties demanded the attention of the Author. To expedite its completion it has been deemed advisable to omit the Anatomy of the Brain and Organs of Sense. These will be dealt with in a separate Part. The plan upon which the work has been carried out is essentially the same as that which was adopted, for the volume upon the Abdomen, and the Author desires to express his thanks to Dr. St. John Brooks, Demonstrator of Anatomy in Trinity College, Dublin, and to Dr. Edgar Hogben, Medical Tutor, Queen's College, Birmingham, for the assistance they have given him in the correction of the proof-sheets. To Dr. Brooks he is also indebted for several suggestions of practical value.

410 HEAD AND NECK. Mucous Membrane of the outer Wall of the Nose.*â€”The vestibule, as we have noted, is lined by integument. The remainder of the outer wall, as well as the roof and floor of the nasal fossa, is lined by mucous membrane, which is continuous through the nasal duct with the ocular conjunctiva, through the various apertures with the delicate lining mem- brane of the air-cells which open into the nose, and through the posterior riares with the pharyngeal mucous membrane. On the outer wall, as on the septum, the mucous membrane is mapped out into an upper olfactory and a lower respiratory portion. This subdivision cannot be appreciated by the naked eye, as the one district passes without any sharp line of demarcation into the other. The olfactory region comprises the upper and middle turbinated bones with the superior meatus; the respiratory region includes the inferior turbinated bone, the middle meatus, the lower meatus, and the greater part of the atrium. In the lower part of the outer wall the mucous membrane is thick and spongy. This is particularly noticeable over the lower borders, and posterior extremities of the middle and inferior turbinated bones, where the membrane presents an irregular surface and forms soft bulging cushions. This condition is largely due to the presence of a rich venous plexus, the vessels of which run for the most part in an anteroposterior direction. In the case of the lower spongy bone, the veins^are The mucous liiitagtf the nasal fossa is frequently termed the schneiderian membrane.

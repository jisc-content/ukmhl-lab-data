123 TRIANGLES OF THE NECK. third of the clavicle. This, of course, can only be done when the dissector of the upper limb has com- pleted the dissection of the axilla. Saw through the clavicle at two points—viz., at the posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid, and the anterior margin of the trapezius—and remove the intermediate piece of bone, after having carefully detached it from the subclavius. The nerve to the subclavius should now be traced to its distribution, and dividing the fibres of the subclavius which still adhere to the acromial third of the clavicle, throw the muscle inwards and allow the shoulder to drop well backwards. Brachial Plexus.—This great nervous plexus is formed by the anterior primary divisions of the four lower cervical nerves and the greater part of the large anterior primary division of the first dorsal nerve. . Above, the plexus is further reinforced by a small twig of communication which passes from the fourth to the fifth cervical nerve, whilst below, a similar connecting twig not infrequently passes upwards in front of the neck of the second rib from the second to the first dorsal nerve. These great nerves emerge from the interval between the scalenus anticus and medius, and proceed downwards and outwards through the lower part of the posterior triangle towards the axilla. The manner in which they unite to form the plexus is very constant. The fifth and sixth nerves unite to form an upper trunk; the seventh nerve remains single and proceeds downwards as a middle trunk; whilst the seventh cervical and first dorsal

84 HEAD AND NECK. the outer surface of the dura mater. This is effected by removing from the spinal canal the loose areolar tissue, soft fat, and posterior intraspinal veins. It is necessary, also, to carefully define the numerous lateral prolongations which the membrane gives to the spinal nerves. Dura Mater—Fig. 13 {d).—In the spinal canal the dura mater constitutes an exceedingly dense and tough fibrous tube, which extends from the foramen magnum above to the base of the sacrum below. Even before this tube of membrane is laid open, the dissector can readily satisfy himself that it is very loosely adapted to the spinal cord, and the nerve-roots constituting the cauda equina ; in other words, it is very capacious as compared with the volume of its contents. Its calibre, moreover, is by no means uniform ; in the cervical and lumbar regions it is considerably wider than in the dorsal region, whilst in the lower part of the lumbar region it rapidly contracts and finally ends by blending with the filum terminale, a fibrous cord which is prolonged downwards through the sacral canal from the extremity of the spinal cord. Above, the dura mater is firmly attached around the margin of the occipital foramen ; below, the filum terminale on which it terminates, can be traced as far as the dorsal aspect of the coccyx, where it is lost by blend- ing with the periosteum investing that bone. If the student recall the characteristics of the dura mater within the cranium, he cannot fail to observe certain striking points of difference between it and

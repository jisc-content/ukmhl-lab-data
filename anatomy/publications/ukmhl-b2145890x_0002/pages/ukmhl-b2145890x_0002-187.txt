ROOT OF THE NECK. body, is poured into the venous system on the left side. Its terminal or cervical portion is displayed in the present dissection. It is a small delicate vessel, frequently mistaken for a vein, which enters the root of the neck upon the left side of the oesophagus. It is here therefore that it should be sought. When it reaches the level of the seventh or perhaps the sixth cervical vertebra, it changes its course and arches outwards and downwards over the apex of the pleura, to gain the outer margin of the internal jugular vein at its angle of union with the subclavian, and into this it opens. Its relations are somewhat complicated. Thus, in coursing outwards, it is placed at a higher level than the subclavian artery, and passes behind the inferior thyroid artery and the internal jugular vein.- Further, it crosses in front of the vertebral artery, and its terminal part usually lies upon the scalenus anticus muscle. A valve composed of two segments guards its orifice into the jugular vein. This allows its contents to pass freely into the vein, but acts as a barrier to the regurgitation of venous blood into the duct. The right lymphatic duct is the corresponding vessel upon the right side. It is a very insignificant duct, and draws its supply of lymph from a much more restricted field. In length it rarely measures more than half-an-inch. It will be found at the inner margin of the scalenus anticus opening into the angle of union between the internal jugular and subclavian veins of the right side. As in the case of the thoracic duct, its orifice is guarded by a double valve.

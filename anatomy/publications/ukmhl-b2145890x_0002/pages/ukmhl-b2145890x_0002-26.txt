12 HEAD AND NECK. joins the external jugular vein near the angle of the lower jaw. The occipital artery, which will be found a short distance to the outer side of the occipital protuber- ance, sends large tortuous branches over the back of the head. These anastomose with the corresponding vessels of the opposite side, and with the posterior auricular and posterior temporal arteries. * The strong temporal fascia which covers the temporal muscle should now be examined, and the attachment of its upper border to the temporal ridge noted. Its further connections will be studied at a later period. Surgical Anatomy of the Scalp.-The close connec- tion between the three superficial layers of the scalp (viz., skin, superficial fascia, and epicranial apeneurosis), and the loose manner in which these are bound by areolar tissue to the pericranium, are of great interest from a surgical point of view. When the scalp is wrenched from the head by machinery, or by any other means,—as, for instance, the scalping knife of a Red Indian—the separation is effected on the plane of the areolar layer The blood-vessels, however, are mainly distributed in the superficial fascia, and therefore large flaps of detached scalp can be replaced upon the denuded periosteum, and yet retain their vitality. It is indeed a rare occurrence for a scalp flap to slough. We have noted how richly the scalp is supplied with blood- vessels. Incised wounds in this region therefore bleed very profusely ; but in addition to this, they bleed with more than usual persistence. This is readily accounted for by the dense character of the superficial fascia, and by the fact that the fibrous septa of this stratum adhere to the coats of the vessels, and prevent them from retracting freely when divided. As will very readily be understood, a collection of pus m the scalp will produce very different results according to the position

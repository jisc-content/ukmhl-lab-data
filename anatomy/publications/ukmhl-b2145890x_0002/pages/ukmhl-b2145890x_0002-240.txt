The infra-orbital is the terminal part of the superior maxillary division of the fifth nerve. It is a large branch which issues from the infra-orbital foramen under cover of the levator labii superiors It forms, with the facial nerve, a dense plexus, and distributes palpebral, nasal, and labial branches. The palpebral twigs turn upwards to supply the skin and conjunctiva of the lower eyelid ; the nasal branches incline inwards upon the side of the nose; and the labial branches run downwards to end in the skin and mucous membrane of the upper lip. From the inferior maxillary division of the fifth, three nerves are furnished to the face-viz., the auri- culotemporal, which has been described in p. 9 J the long buccal nerve ; and the mental nerve. The long buccal nerve will be found coming out from under cover of the anterior border of the masseter muscle Its branches communicate freely with the facial nerve around the facial vein, and supply the skin and the mucous membrane of the cheek. The latter pierce the buccinator muscle. The mental nerve is a large branch of the inferior dental, which appears through the mental foramen of the lower jaw under cover of the depressor anguli oris. It communicates with the facial, and supplies the mucous membrane of the lower hp, and the integument of the chin and lower hp. The mental foramen through which the nerve emerges,

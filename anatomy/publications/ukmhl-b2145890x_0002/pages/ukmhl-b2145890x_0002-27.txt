13 REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN. it occupies. If it is formed under the epicranial aponeurosis it spreads in all directions ; indeed it is only limited in front by the superciliary ridges of the frontal bone, behind by the superior curved line of the occipital bone, and upon either side by the temporal ridges : if formed in the superficial fascia it is confined to the point at which it originates. The anterior terminal branch of the superficial temporal artery is the vessel most commonly selected for the operation of arteriotomy. REMOVAL OP THE BRAIN. On the second day after the subject has been placed on the table, the two dissectors of the head and neck should, in conjunction with each other, proceed to remove the brain. The head being supported upon a block, an incision is made along the middle line of the head, through the epicranium, the subjacent areolar tissue, and the peri- cranium, from the root of the nose in front, to the external occipital protuberance behind. This must be done boldly, so as to divide everything right down to the bone. With a series of sharp strokes with the handle of the scalpel, the pericranium on each side can easily be turned outwards, so as to leave the bone perfectly bare. Observe, however, that although the pericranium is loosely attached over the surface of the various bones of the vault, that it is firmly attached along the lines of the cranial sutures by processes that dip in between the bones, so as to separate their edges. On reaching the temporal ridges push the knife through the attachment of the temporal fascia, so that the blade lies between the temporal muscle

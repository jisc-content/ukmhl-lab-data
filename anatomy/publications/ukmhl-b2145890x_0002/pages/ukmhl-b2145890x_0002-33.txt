19 REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN. separate in order that the inner supporting layer may form strong folds or partitions, which run in between the various parts of the brain. By these latter the cranial cavity is divided into compartments com- municating freely with each other, and each holding a corresponding division of the brain (Fig. 5). But the dissector must now proceed with his dissec- tion to verify these points. Begin by tilting the head forward. Support it in this position, and divide the dura mater right round the head and along the cut surface of the cranium. Leave a small portion in the middle line in front, and in the middle line behind, undivided. The subdural space is now opened into. This is the term which is applied to the interval between the dura mater and the arachnoid materâ€” Fig. 3 (sd), p. 15. It contains a very small quantity of serous fluid which moistens the opposed surfaces of these membranes. On turning the divided dura mater upwards towards the middle line on each side, a striking contrast between its two surfaces will be observed. The superficial surface, as we have noted, is rough and flocculent; the deep surface is smooth, polished, and I glistening. Further, the cerebral veins returning the ! blood from the surface of the cerebral hemispheres hwill be seen shining through the arachnoid. They hare lodged in the fissures between the convolutions, and run upwards to the middle line. Reaching the superior longitudinal sinus they are suddenly directed forwards, and lie against the wall of the sinus for some distance before they open into it.

U8 HEAD AND NECK. (6.) Some of the deep cervical lymphatic glands termed the glandulse concatenatse which lie along the sterno-mastoid. (7.) The transversalis colli artery and vein, which cross the lower part of the space. (8.) The upper part of the brachial plexus of nerves. In the supra-clavicular space a great number of highly important structures are collected together within a very limited area. The great blood-vessels and nerves which pass from the neck to the upper limb traverse this space. Its contents are the following :â€” ( Subclavian. Arteries < Transversalis colli. I Supra-scapular. {External jugular. Supra-scapular. Transversalis colli. Subclavian. ( The trunks of the brachial plexus and their Nerves \ branches. Lymphatic glands. These structures lie deeply. They are usually embedded in soft fat, and covered by a very distinct layer of fascia, which is prolonged outwards over them from the outer border of the scalenus anticus, and it takes some time to expose them fully. Begin by dissecting out the transversalis colli and supra- scapular vessels. They will be found emerging from under cover of the sterno-mastoid, and passing out- wards across the space. The supra-scapular vessels

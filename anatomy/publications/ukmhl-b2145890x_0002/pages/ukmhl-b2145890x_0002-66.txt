It is the duty of the dissector of the upper limb to dissect these, but the dissector of the head and neck should trace the super- ficial cervical artery to its origin from the transversalis colli. Levator Anguli Scapulae.-This muscle must next be dissected, and its attachments defined. In cleaning it, certain nerve-twigs (usually two in number) from the third and fourth cervical nerves, will be observed entering its substance. Further passing downwards under cover of this muscle, the nerve to the' rhomboids and the posterior scapular artery will be found Almost invariably the nerve to the rhomboids gives one or two twigs to the levator anguli scapulae. The levator anguli scapula arises by four slips from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the upper four cervical vertebrae. These unite to form an elongated muscle which extends downwards and backwards to be inserted into the upper part of the vertebral border of the scapula, from the superior angle to the spine. As already noted, the nerve- supply of the levator anguli scapulae comes from the third and fourth cervical nerves, and also from the nerve to the rhomboids. The Posterior Scapular Artery should be followed to its origin from the transversalis colli arterv Having satisfied himself upon this point, the dissector must proceed no further with the dissection

INFERIOR NASAL NERVES. 413 The inferior nasal nerves are two in number, and they both arise from the great or anterior palatine nerve. Carefully raise the mucous membrane from the posterior part of the outer wall of the nasal fossa. Make a vertical incision, through the membrane over the internal pterygoid process, and turn it cautiously over from behind forwards. The upper of the two inferior nasal nerves will be found emerging through a small aperture in the vertical plate of the palate bone, at a point between the posterior extremities of the middle and inferior turbinated bones. It divides into an ascending and descending branch. The former runs forwards on the middle spongy bone ; the latter, extends forwards upon the inferior spongy bone. The lower of the two inferior nasal nerves appears through a foramen in the vertical plate of the palate bone immediately behind the posterior end of the inferior turbinated bone upon the outer surface of which it proceeds in a forward direction. The nasal nerve proper should be exposed as it descends in the groove upon the deep surface of the nasal bone (p. 327). It gives, as we have noted, a branch inwards to the septum ; an external twig may also be traced to the mucous membrane over the fore part of the outer wall and to the fore parts of the middle and inferior turbinated bones. The main artery of supply to the nasal mucous membrane is the sphenopalatine, a branch of the internal maxillary. It gains entrance to the nasal fossa through the spheno-palatine foramen in com- pany with the superior nasal and naso-palatine

VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE SOFT PALATE. 383 muscle lies in front of the levator palati. It is flat and bandlike and closely applied to the deep surface of the internal pterygoid muscle. It arises above from the scaphoid fossa at the root of the internal pterygoid plate, from the spine of the sphenoid and from the outer aspect of the Eustachian tube. It descends perpendicularly and ends in a tendon which turns horizontally inwards under the hamular process. A synovial bursa facilitates the play of the tendon upon the bone. In the soft palate the tendon expands below the deep part of the palato-pharyngeus, and is inserted partly into the transverse ridge on the under surface of the horizontal plate of the palate bone, and partly into the palatal aponeurosis with which it blends. Palatal Aponeurosis.—The palatal aponeurosis extends backwards from the posterior margin of the hard palate to give strength and support to the soft palate. At first it is strongly marked, but becomes gradually weaker as it approaches the free border of the soft palate. A portion of the deep fibres of the palato-pharyngeus, some of the fibres of the levator palati and the tendon of the tensor palati obtain attachment to it. Vessels and Nerves of the Soft Palate.— The inferior or ascending palatine branch of the facial is, as a rule, the principal artery of supply to the soft palate. It has already been traced to the outer wall of the pharynx (pp. 185 and 283). Here it

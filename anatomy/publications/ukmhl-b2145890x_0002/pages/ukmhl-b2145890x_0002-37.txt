REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN. 23 upon either side the anterior extremity of the inner free margin of the tentorium cerebelli as it passes forward to be attached to the anterior clinoid process. Pressing this outwards with the point of the knife, the » minute trochlear nerve (fourth cranial nerve) will be brought into view. It lies under shelter of the free border of the tentorium, and should be divided at this stage. The head must in the next place be turned forcibly round, so that the face is directed over the left shoulder. On raising the posterior part of the right hemisphere with the fingers, it will be observed to rest upon the tentorium cerebelli—a broad horizontal process of dura mater, which inter- venes between it and the cerebellum. Divide the tentorium along its attached border, and take care in doing this not to injure the subjacent cerebellum. -When the division is effected, push the tentorium backwards out of the way with the point of the knife. Now turn the head so as to bring its left side uppermost, and treat the tentorium on this side in the same manner. The two parts of the fifth nerve per- forating the dura mater near the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, the sixth nerve piercing the dura mater behind the dorsum sellae of the sphenoid bone, the three parts of the seventh nerve disappearing into the internal auditory meatus, the eighth nerve leaving the skull through the jugular foramen, and the two slips of the ninth nerve piercing the dura mater over the anterior condyloid foramen, will each in turn come into view upon either side, and each must be divided in succession. In the case of the

468 HEAD AND NECK. The smaller of these extends forwards upon the side of the tongue, and may be traced as far as a point midway between the root and the tip. The larger branch turns upwards and is distributed to mucous membrane which invests the posterior third of the dorsum linguae. It gives twigs to the circum- vallate papillae, and some fine filaments may be followed to the anterior surface of the epiglottis. The glossopharyngeal nerve is the principal nerve of taste. The lingual and hypoglossal nerves are described in* pp. 271 and 273, and their terminal branches should now be traced as far as it is possible to do so. The internal laryngeal nerve gives a few delicate filaments to the glosso-epiglottidean folds and the mucous membrane of the root of the tongue. The ranine artery should be followed to the tip of the tongue, where it forms a small loop, or anastom- osis with its fellow of the opposite side (p. 277). Septum Linguae.â€”The septum of the tongue can best be seen by making a transverse section through the organ. This will also in a measure demonstrate the stratum transversum and stratum perpendiculare of muscular fibres. The septum is a mesially placed fibrous partition. It is strongest behind, where it is attached to the hyoid bone. THE END.

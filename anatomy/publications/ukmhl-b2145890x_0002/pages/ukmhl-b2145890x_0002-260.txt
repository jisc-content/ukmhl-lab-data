242 HEAD AND NECK. vessels are the superficial temporal artery dividing into its two terminal branches and its accompanying vein. Behind the ear some terminal twigs of the posterior auricular artery will also be seen ascending upon the posterior part of the fascia. All these parts should be carefully gone over a second time, as most of them must now be removed. Throw the temporal part of the orbicularis palpe- brarum forwards ; preserve the middle temporal artery, and the temporal branch of the temporo-malar nerve, both of which pierce the fascia; turn downwards the other vessels and nerves, and remove what remains of the temporal part of the epicranial aponeurosis and of the two upper ear muscles. The temporal fascia is in this manner laid bare. The temporal fascia is a strong glistening aponeu- rosis which is stretched over the temporal fossa, and binds down the muscle of the same name. Its upper margin is attached to the upper of the two rough lines which constitute the temporal ridge on the lateral aspect of the skull, and in front to the temporal crest of the frontal bone. As it approaches the zygomatic arch, it splits into two laminae, which are separated from each other by a narrow interval filled with fat. These are attached to the outer and inner margins of the upper border of the zygomatic arch and to the posterior border of the malar bone They can readily be demonstrated by dividing the superficial layer close to its attachment and throwing it upwards ; by the handle of the knife the attachment of the deep layer can then be made out.

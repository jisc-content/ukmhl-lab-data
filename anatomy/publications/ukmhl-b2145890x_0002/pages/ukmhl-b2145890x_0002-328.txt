HEAD AND NECK 3io The recurrent branch of the supra-maxillaris takes origin by several fine roots, and runs outwards to the anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery. It communicates with the fine filaments of the recurrent branch of the infra-maxillary division of the fifth nerve (p. 258). The ophthalmic division is the smallest of the three parts of the fifth nerve, and, like the supra-maxillary, it is entirely composed of sensory fibres. It proceeds forwards in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, and ends close to the sphenoidal fissure by dividing into three terminal branches. As it traverses the sinus it is accompanied by the third and fourth nerves, both of which occupy a higher level. Like the other two divisions of the fifth nerve the ophthalmic nerve gives off a recurrent branch to the dura mater. It also sends a slender twig to each of the other three nerves which traverse the cavernous sinusâ€”viz., the third, fourth, and sixth, and it receives several filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic. The recurrent branch springs from the ophthalmic nerve close to its origin, and runs backwards for a short distance in the sheath of the fourth nerve. After leaving this nerve it breaks up into fine terminal filaments, which are distributed between the two layers of the dura mater in the neighbourhood of the superior petrosal sinus. The terminal branches of the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve are the nasal, the lachrymal, and the frontal The nasal, as a rule, takes origin first; soon after, the lachrymal is given off, and then the stem of the nerve is continued onwards as the frontal. All these nerves enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure.

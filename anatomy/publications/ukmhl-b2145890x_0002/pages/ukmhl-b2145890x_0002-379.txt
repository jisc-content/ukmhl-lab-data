THE ALAR OR CHECK LIGAMENTS. 361 anterior margin of the foramen magnum (Figs. 39, hy and 40, b and f). The appendix inferior, very much shorter, extends downwards, and is fixed to the posterior aspect of the body of the axis vertebra (Figs. 39, m, and 40 c). Detach the appendix superior from the basilar process, and throw it downwards. The suspensory ligament is thus displayed, and a better view of the alar or check ligaments obtained. The Suspensory Ligament (Figs. 39,^", and 40, h) of the odontoid consists of two partsâ€”an anterior and a posterior (Barkow). The posterior part is a rounded cord-like ligament which is attached below to the summit of the odontoid process, and above to the fore-margin of the foramen magnum. This liga- ment, inasmuch as it is developed around the con- tinuation of the chorda dorsalis from the odontoid to the basis cranii, is a structure of considerable morpho- logical interest. The a?iterior part of the suspensory ligament is a flat and weak band which is attached above to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum at the same point as the posterior portion. Below, the two portions are separated by an interval filled with cellular tissue, and the anterior part is attached to the odontoid process immediately above its articular facet for the anterior arch of the atlas. The Alar or Check Ligaments {ligamenta lateralia superiord) (Fig. 40, i) are very powerful bands which spring, one from each side of the summit of the

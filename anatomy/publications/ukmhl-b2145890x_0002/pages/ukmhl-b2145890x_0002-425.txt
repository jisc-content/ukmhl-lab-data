407 MEATUSES OF THE NOSE. which lies between the middle and inferior turbinated bones, and is continued directly forwards into the atrium. The middle spongy bone should be forcibly tilted upwards and backwards. Upon the lateral wall of the meatus a deep curved groove or gutter which runs from above downwards and back- wards, will be observed. In this groove, which is termed the infundidulum (Fig. 47), are the openings of the frontal sinus, the anterior ethmoidal cells, and the antrum of Highmore. The aperture of the frontal sinus is a small circular opening placed at the upper and fore extremity of the infundibulum. The anterior ethmoidal cells as a general rule open a short distance lower down (Fig. 45); in some cases, how- ever, the aperture may be placed above the groove (Fig. 47). The slit-like opening of the antrum of Highmore will be noticed in the hinder part of the infundibulum. The dissector should now pro- ceed to open up the antrum by removing its outer wall. This may be done by sawing upwards through the root of the zygomatic process of the superior maxillary bone. The orifice by means of which this great air-sinus communicates with the middle meatus will be noticed to be placed on the inner wall of the cavity much nearer the roof than the floorâ€”a position highly unfavourable for the escape of fluids which may collect within it. Very frequently, however, a second orifice, circular in outline, will be found. This is situated lower down, and opens into the middle meatus immediately above the middle point of the attached margin of the inferior turbinated bone.

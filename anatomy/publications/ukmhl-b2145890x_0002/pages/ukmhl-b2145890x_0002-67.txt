DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 51 of the transversalis colli, as it can be displayed to greater advantage after the subject has been turned. The transversalis colli artery will be seen to terminate near the outer margin of the levator anguli scapulae, by dividing into the superficial cervical and posterior scapular arteries. The former of these proceeds upon the superficial aspect of the levator anguli scapulae, whilst the latter passes under cover of that muscle. It is the duty of the dissector of the upper limb to trace the further course of the posterior scapular artery along the base of the scapula. Omohyoid — Supra-scapular Artery and Nerve.—The posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle, and the supra-scapular artery and nerve can now be displayed by dissecting towards the upper margin of the scapula. This dissection must be effected in conjunction with the dissector of the upper limb, and it is well not to expose these structures at the present stage for more than an inch from the upper border of the scapula. The slender posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle will be seen to arise from the upper border of the scapula, immediately behind the supra-scapular notch. It also derives fibres from the ligament which bridges across this notch. The further connections of the omo-hyoid will be studied in the dissection of the triangles of the neck after the body has been turned. The supra-scapular artery will be noticed to enter the supra-spinous fossa of the scapula, by passing over

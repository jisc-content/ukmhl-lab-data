It is well, however, that the dissector should understand that it is only after the parts are relaxed by dissection that these vessels come to lie within the space. When the fascia and platysma are in position they are completely overlapped by the sterno-mastoid muscle. The common carotid artery is enveloped, along with the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve, in a common sheath of fascia. The carotid sheath should be slit open, care being taken of the descendens noni n^rve, which descends obliquely either in front of it or within it. Endeavour also to make out the connections of this sheath with the pre- tracheal and prevertebral layers of the fascia. In the

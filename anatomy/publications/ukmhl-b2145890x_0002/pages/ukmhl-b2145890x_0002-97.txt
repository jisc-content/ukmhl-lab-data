DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 81 ever, the dissector should note the high elasticity of the ligamenta subflava. This can be tested by stretch- ing the specimen. Between the dura mater and the walls of the spinal canal, the dissector will notice a quantity of loose areolar tissue and soft fat. The latter is especially plentiful in the sacral region, where it resembles somewhat the marrow which occupies the medullary cavity of a long bone. In the midst of this areolo- fatty material, great numbers of large veins and minute arteries are found ramifying upon the walls of the canal. Spinal Arteries.â€”A minute spinal artery in a well-injected subject will be found entering the spinal canal through each intervertebral foramen, where it usually lies at a higher level than the spinal nerve. These arteries are derived from different sources in the different regions of the spine. In the cervical region they come from the vertebral artery; in the dorsal region from the dorsal branches of the inter- costal arteries; in the lumbar region from the dorsal branches of the lumbar arteries. They supply with blood the spinal cord and its meninges, the bones, the periosteum, and the ligaments; and their arrangement is very much the same in the three regions. Each spinal artery may be looked upon as giving off three main twigs : of these one ramifies upon the deep surface of the neural arches and ligamenta subflava ; another can be followed to the dura mater, which it pierces immediately above the point of exit of the PART III. a

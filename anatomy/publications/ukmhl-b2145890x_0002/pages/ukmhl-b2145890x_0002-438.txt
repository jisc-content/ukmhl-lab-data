420 HEAD AND NECK. The pterygopalatine artery traverses the canal of the same name, and has a corresponding distribution. The sphenopalatine enters the nasal fossa through the sphenopalatine foramen, and has already been followed to its distribution (p. 413). FACIAL NERVE IN THE TEMPORAL BONE. The facial and auditory nerves, together with the pars intermedia, have already been traced into the internal auditory meatus (p. 30- The dissector should now open up this meatus and follow the facial nerve in its course through the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The canal which it occupies is termed the aqueduct of Fallopius. This begins at the bottom of the internal auditory meatus, and opens on the exterior of the skull at the stylo-mastoid foramen. Between these points it pursues a complicated course, and this, combined with the density of the bone, renders the dissection very difficult. Perhaps the easiest method of opening up the aqueduct, is, in the first instance, to decalcify the bone in a weak solution of acid, but, at the same time, it should be clearly understood that, with a little care, there is nothing to hinder the dissector carrying out the dissection on the hard bone by means of the saw and the chisel.

DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 87 easily demonstrated by making an incision into it, and inserting the handle of the scalpel, or, better still, by inflating the sac with air by means of a blow-pipe. Above, the arachnoid mater becomes continuous at the level of the foramen magnum with the correspond- ing membrane which clothes the brain, whilst, laterally, it is prolonged outwards upon the various nerve-roots, thus contributing to each a tubular sheath. These sheathes, however, do not proceed far; they soon cease. Stib-arachnoid space—Fig. 13 (sap.).—This term is applied to the wide space between the arachnoid and pia mater. It is occupied by a variable amount of cerebro-spinal fluid, and in the mesial plane posteriorly it is traversed by a delicate septum, which connects the arachnoid with the pia mater. This partition is named the septum posticum—Fig. 13 (sp.)—and in cervical region it is nearly complete ; lower down, however, it becomes imperfect and broken up. With a little care this septum can easily be demonstrated. The spinal sub-arachnoid space is directly continuous with the cranial sub-arachnoid space. Pia Mater.—Clear away the arachnoid mater, and proceed to the study of the pia mater. This is a firm membrane, closely investing and closely adherent to the spinal cord. In front, it sends a fold into the antero-median fissure of the spinal cord, whilst behind a septum continuous with its deep surface dips into the postero-median fissure. Anteriorly, in the mesial plane, it is thickened in the form of a longitudinal

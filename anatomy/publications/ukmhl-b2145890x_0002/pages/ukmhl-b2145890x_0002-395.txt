377 INTERIOR OF THE PHARYNX. followed downwards, and opposite the isthmus faucium they are separated from each other by considerable intervals. The follicular glands are similar in character to those which are observed on the root of the tongue, and to those which constitute the tonsils. In some localities they occur in an isolated condition, in others they are collected together into masses of different sizes. One aggregation of con- siderable size is placed upon the upper part of the posterior wall of the pharynx, where this joins the roof. It is termed the pharyngeal tonsil (Luschka), and is of some clinical importance. It is oval in form, and about half-an-inch in length. The soft palate which hangs like a curtain over the isthmus faucium may be regarded as dividing the pharynx into an upper and lower part. The upper portion lies behind the nasal fossae, and presents four aperturesâ€”viz., the two posterior nares, and the two mouths of the Eustachian tubes. The posterior nares are two large oval openings placed immediately below the base of the skull, and looking directly backwards into the pharynx. They constitute the communication between the nasal fossae and the pharynx, and are' separated from each other by the thin posterior border of the vomer bone. The vertical diameter of each opening measures about one inch, whilst the transverse diameter at the widest part is about half-an-inch. By looking through the posterior nares the dissector may obtain a partial view of the two lower meatuses of the nose, and of the posterior extremities of the middle and inferior turbinated bones.

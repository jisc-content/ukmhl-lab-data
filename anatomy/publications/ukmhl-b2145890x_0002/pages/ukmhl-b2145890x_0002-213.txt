DISSECTION OF THE FACE. 195 The Conjunctiva is the membrane which lines the deep surface of both the lids, and is reflected from them on to the anterior aspect of the eyeball. At the margins of the lids, it is continuous with the skin, whilst through the puncta and the lachrymal canals it becomes continuous with the lining membrane of the lachrymal sac. The line of reflection of the conjunctiva from the lids on to the eyeball is termed th& fornix. Owing to the greater depth of the upper lid the conjunctival recess between the upper lid and the eyeball is of greater extent than that in connection with the lower lid. The connection between the conjunctiva on the one hand, and the eyelids and sclerotic coat of the eyeball on the other, is of a loose character. Over the cornea, however, the membrane becomes thinned down to a mere epithelial covering, which is closely adherent. In connection with the conjunctiva the plica semilunaris and the caruncula lachrymalis must be examined. The caruncula is the reddish fleshy- looking elevation, which occupies the centre of the lacus lachrymalis at the inner canthus. From its surface a few minute hairs project. The plica semilunaris is of interest because in the human eye it is the rudimentary representative of the membrana nictitans, or third eyelid, of the bird and many other animals. It is a small vertical fold of conjunctiva, which is placed immediately to the outer side of the caruncula and slightly overlaps at this point the eyeball.

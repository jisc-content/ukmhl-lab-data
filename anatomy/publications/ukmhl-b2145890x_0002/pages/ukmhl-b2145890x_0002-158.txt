140 HEAD AND NECK. facial artery passes upwards and forwards in the midst of this gland, whilst the facial -vein lies superficial to it. But whilst the facial artery runs through the gland, the dissector should note that it can be separ- ated from it without any laceration of the gland- lobules. The gland is, as it were, wrapped round it, so that, although at first sight the artery seems to pierce it, it is merely contained in a deep furrow in its substance. Before entering the gland, the facial artery gives off its tonsillitic and palatine branches, whilst its submental and submaxillary branches arise within the gland. The submental artery runs forwards towards the chin. The mylo-hyoid nerve and artery will be seen passing forwards and downwards upon the mylo-hyoid muscle under cover of the submaxillary gland. The twigs of the nerve to the muscle of the same name and to the anterior belly of the digastric should be followed out. Only a very small part of the hypoglossal nerve is seen in this space. It lies upon the hyoglossus muscle immediately above the hyoid bone, and disappears under cover of the posterior border of the mylo-hyoid muscle. Numerous small lymphatic glands lie under shelter of the base of the lower jaw. The external carotid artery enters the posterior part of the digastric triangle. Here it lies under cover of the lower part of the parotid gland, and gives off its pos- terior auricular branch, which passes upwards and back- wards along the upper border of the digastric muscle.

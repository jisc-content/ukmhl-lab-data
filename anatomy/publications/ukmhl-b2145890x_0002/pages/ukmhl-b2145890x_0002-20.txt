g HEAD AND NECK. the ear Above it is broad, and arises from the epicranial aponeurosis where it covers the temporal fascia ; below, as the fibres approach the auricle, they converge and gain an insertion into the upper part of the cranial surface of the pinna. Awakens aurem.-TUs muscle, which is smaller than the preceding, is placed in front of the ear and therefore the auricle must be pulled backwards in order that its fibres may be rendered tense. It arises from the cranial aponeurosis and slightly from the back part of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, and it is inserted into the anterior aspect of the helix The retrahens aurem-Fig. I (3)-is a strongly- marked short band of muscular fibres which springs from the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and is inserted into the posterior part of the concha. It is readily exposed by drawing the ear forwards. The attrahens is supplied by a twig from the temporal branches of the facial nerve; the retrains and attollens by the posterior auricular branch of the facial nerve. Nerves of the Scalp.-Two nerves are given to ^ frontal parietal portions of the scalp by *e frontal branch of the ophthalmic division of the fifth cranial nerve. These are (a.) the supratrochlear, (*.) the supra-orbital. The supratrochlear nerve leaves the orbit close to its inner angle and then turns upwards under cover of the Xularis palpebrarum.

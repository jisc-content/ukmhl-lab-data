Under cover of the sternp-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles will be observed the larynx, the isthmus, and a considerable part of the lateral lobe of the thyroid body and the trachea. The recurrent laryngeal lies deeply. It will be found in the interval between the gullet and trachea. As the ceosophagus inclines to the left behind the trachea, it follows that it is only seen to any extent in the left muscular triangle * Contents of the Carotid Triangle. - Within this sub-division are the following structures :â€” (i.)

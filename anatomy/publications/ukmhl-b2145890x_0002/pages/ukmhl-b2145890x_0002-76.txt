HEAD AND NECK. 6o Longissimus Dorsi.—The longissimus dorsi is the largest of the three divisions into which the erector spinae splits, and it extends upwards as high as the first dorsal vertebra. It is inserted by two distinct rows of tendinous and fleshy slips. The inner row consists of a series of tendons attached in the dorsal region to the tips of the transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebrae, and in the loins to the accessory pro- cesses of the lumbar vertebrae; the outer row is composed of fleshy slips, which are inserted in the dorsal region into the lower ten ribs, midway between their tubercles and angles, and in the loins to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. But the muscle does not end in the dorsal region ; it is carried up into the neck, and even reaches as high as the mastoid process of the skull by two muscular continu- ations termed respectively— (i.) the transversalis cervicis, and (2.) the trachelo-mastoid. Transversalis Cervicis—This muscle takes origin in the upper dorsal region, by four or five slips from the transverse processes of a corresponding number of the highest dorsal vertebrae, and it gains insertion into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of all the cervical vertebrae, with the exception of the first and the last. The Trachelo-Mastoid is prolonged upwards in the neck under cover of the splenius. Its origin from the transverse processes of three or four of the upper dorsal vertebrae is intimately associated with that of the transversalis cervicis—so much so, indeed, that

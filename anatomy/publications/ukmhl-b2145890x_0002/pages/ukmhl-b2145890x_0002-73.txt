57 DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. more than the lower half of the ligamentum nuchae, and from the spines of the seventh cervical and upper six dorsal vertebrae. From this the fibres pass obliquely upwards and outwards in the form of a thick, flat muscle, which soon divides into a cervical and a cranial portion. These are termed respectively the splenius colli and the splenius capitis. The splenius colli turns forwards and is inserted, behind the levator anguli scapulae, by three or four tendinous slips, into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the upper three or four cervical vertebrae. The splenius capitis passes under cover of the upper part of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and gains insertion into the lower part of the mastoid process and into the outer half of the superior curved line of the occipital bone. To obtain a view of this insertion, the sterno-mastoid muscle may be divided along the superior curved line of the occipital bone as far as the mastoid process. Upon no account, however, detach it from the mastoid process. Dissection.â€”The erector spinae and complexus muscles must now be dissected. Begin by reflecting the splenius muscle. Detach it from its origin and throw it outwards and upwards towards its insertion. In doing this preserve the cutaneous branches of the cervical nerves which pierce it. Next remove the vertebral aponeurosis and turn the latissimus dorsi, the serratus posticus inferior, and the superficial lamella of the lumbar fascia outwards.

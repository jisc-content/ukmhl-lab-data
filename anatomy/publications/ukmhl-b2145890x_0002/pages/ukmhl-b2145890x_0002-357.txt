TEMPORO-MALAR NERVE. 339 Temporo - Malar Nerve. —In order that the temporo-malar, or orbital branch of the - superior maxillary division of the fifth nerve, may be displayed in its course through the orbit, the orbital contents must be removed. It will then be found in the midst of a little soft fat in the angle between the floor and outer wall of the orbit. The temporo-malar nerve arises in the spheno- maxillary fossa, from the superior maxillary division of the fifth nerve, and it enters the orbit by passing through the spheno-maxillary fissure. It almost immediately divides into two terminal branches—viz., the temporal and the malar. The temporal branch runs forwards and upwards upon the outer wall of the orbit, under cover of the periosteum, and after receiving a communicating twig from the lachrymal nerve it enters the temporal canal of the malar bone. This conducts it to the fore part of the temporal region, where it has already been examined (pp. 9 and 247). The malar branch (subcutaneus malae) continues for- ward in the angle between the floor and outer wall of the orbit, and is finally conducted to the face by a minute canal which perforates the malar bone. Here it has been displayed in the dissection of the face (p. 221). student is referred to the admirable account which is given of its connections by Mr. Lockwood in vol. xx. Journal of Anatomy and Physiology. 1885. He points out how important it is for the surgeon in the operation for the removal of the upper jaw to carefully preserve the attachments of the suspensory ligament. If these be destroyed, there is a danger Of the eyeball sinking downwards to such an extent that it may afterwards be necessary to remove it.

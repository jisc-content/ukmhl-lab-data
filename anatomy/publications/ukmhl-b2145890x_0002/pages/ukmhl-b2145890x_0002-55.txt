DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 41 introduced into the cranial cavity. The skull-cap should then be replaced and retained in position by bringing the scalp flaps over it, and stitching them accurately together. It is a very common practice with students, when the scalp has been dissected and the brain removed, to throw the skull-cap aside. This proceeding cannot be too strongly condemned, because the contour of the head is then lost, and in the subsequent dissection false conceptions are apt to be formed. DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. On the third day after the subject has been placed in the dissecting-room its position is changed. It is now laid on its face, with its chest and pelvis supported by blocks. The head should be allowed to fall well over the end of the table (PI. III). During the four days that the body is allowed to lie in this position, the dissectors of the head and neck have to dissect the dorsal aspect of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions, and in addition remove the spinal cord. The dissectors of the upper limbs take part in this dissection. It is their duty to dissect the superficial and deep fasciae in the thoracic, and lumbar regions, and also those structures which connect the limb to the trunk posteriorly. To them therefore belong the trapezius muscle below the seventh cervical spine, the latissimus dorsi and the rhomboid muscles, together with their vessels and nerves of supply.

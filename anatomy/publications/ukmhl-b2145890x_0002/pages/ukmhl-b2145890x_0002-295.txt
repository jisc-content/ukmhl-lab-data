277 LINGUAL VEINS. fellow of the opposite side and with the submental branch of the facial artery. The ranine artery runs forwards upon the inferior aspect of the tongue as far as the tip. It can easily be exposed by dividing the mucous membrane along its course, when it will be seen to lie close to the attachment of the frcenum to the tongue, and to be continued forwards in the interval between the genio- hyo-glossus and the inferior lingualis muscle. Its course is tortuous to allow of the protrusion or elonga- tion of the organ, and it gives off numerous branches. Lingual Veins.â€”The lingual artery is accompanied by two small venae comites which lie with it under cover of the hyo-glossus j but the main vein of the tongue is termed the ranine or the satellite vein of the hypoglossal nerve, on account of its accompanying this nerve upon the superficial surface of the hyo- glossus. These veins receive tributaries corresponding more or less closely with the branches of the artery, and they open into the common facial vein, or perhaps directly into the internal jugular vein. The Stylohyoid Ligament is the last structure to be examined in this dissection. It is a fibrous cord which springs from the tip of the styloid process and passes downwards and forwards to be attached under cover of the hyo-glossus muscle to the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone. It is not uncommon to find it partially ossified ; in other cases it may assume a ruddy hue and contain muscular fibres.

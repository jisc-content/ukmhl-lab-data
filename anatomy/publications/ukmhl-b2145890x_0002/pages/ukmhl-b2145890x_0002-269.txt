THE INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. 25 I The meningeal and tympanic branches " proceed upwards under cover of the external pterygoid muscle, and therefore cannot be fully studied until this muscle is reflected. The inferior dental artery arises opposite the middle meningeal, and runs downwards upon the internal lateral ligament to enter the inferior dental foramen of the lower jaw. It is generally accompanied by two venae cornites, which lie one upon either side of it, and it is placed behind the inferior dental nerve. Just before entering the canal, the inferior dental artery gives off the slender mylo-hyoid branch, which is carried downwards and forwards with the corresponding nerve, upon the deep aspect of the lower jaw, to the digastric triangle of the neck. The branches from the second part are given off for the supply of the neighbouring muscles. The masseteric passes outwards behind the temporal muscle with the nerve of the same name, and has been seen entering the masseter muscle. The pterygoid branches are a few irregular twigs, which are given to the pterygoid muscles. The deep temporal arteries are two in number—anterior and posterior,—and pass upwards in the fore and hinder part of the temporal fossa, between the bony wall of the cranium and the muscle. They end in twigs' for the supply of the temporal muscle, and anastomose with the middle temporal artery. The anterior deep temporal also communicates with the lachrymal artery by branches, which enter the orbit through foramina in the malar bone, and great wing of the sphenoid. The buccar-

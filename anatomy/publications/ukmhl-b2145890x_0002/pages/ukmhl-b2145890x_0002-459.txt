441 THYRO-ARYTENOID MUSCLE. from the crico-thyroid membrane. From this attachment its fibres run backwards and upwards, and converge to be inserted into the anterior surface and lower border of the processus muscularis or outer angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. The superficial or outer surface of this muscle is covered by the ala of the thyroid cartilage and the upper part of the crico-thyroid muscle; its deep surface is applied to the lateral part of the crico- thyroid membrane. Thyro-arytenoid Muscle.â€”This is a muscular sheet which is placed above the crico-arytenoideus lateralis. The contiguous margins of these muscles are sometimes found so intimately blended that it is impossible to effect a natural separation. The thyro-arytenoid muscle is usually described as consisting of a superficial and a deep portion termed respectively the thyro-arytenoideus externus and internus. This subdivision, however, cannot be regarded as a natural one seeing that the two parts are as a general rule inseparably united, and can only be isolated from each other by artificial means. The thyro-arytenoideus externus is a broad muscular layer which lies immediately subjacent to the ala of the thyroid cartilage. Its lower border is in contact with the lateral crico-arytenoid muscle whilst its upper border is placed at a higher level than the true vocal cord. Some of its upper fibres, therefore, are in relation to the-wall of the laryngeal sinus. In front, the thyro-arytenoideus externus arises from the lower

330 HEAD AND NECK. The lachrymal artery accompanies the lachrymal nerve, and supplies the gland of that name, the conjunctiva and the outer portions of the two eyelids. The muscular twigs come off at variable points, not only from the main artery, but also from certain of its branches. They supply the muscles contained in the orbital cavity. The arteria retince centralis is a minute, but im- portant artery. It pierces the optic nerve about a quarter of an inch behind the eye-ball, and is con- ducted in its substance to the interior of the globe of the eye. The ciliary arteries are very numerous. Two groups are recognised—viz., a posterior and an anterior. The posterior ciliary arteries run with the ciliary nerves. At first four and five in number they divide into fifteen or twenty twigs which pierce the sclerotic around the entrance of the optic nerve. The anterior ciliary arteries come off in the fore part of the orbit from the lachrymal and muscular branches. They vary in number from six to eight, and they run to the anterior part of the eyeball, where they form an arterial circle under the conjunctiva. From this, twigs arise which pierce the sclerotic immediately behind the cornea. The supra-orbital artery accompanies the supra- orbital nerve, and thus gains the forehead, where it has been dissected at a previous stage (p. 11). The ethmoidal arteries are two in number—anterior and posterior—and they run to the anterior and posterior internal orbital foramina. The posterior

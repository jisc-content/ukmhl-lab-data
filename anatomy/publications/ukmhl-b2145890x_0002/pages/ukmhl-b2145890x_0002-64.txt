4g HEAD AND NECK. tenata, which lie along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, must be preserved, and the spinal accessory nerve, and two or three cervical nerves crossing from the posterior border of the sterno- mastoid to the trapezius, should be dissected out. The boundaries of the triangular space of which the upper part is thus displayed will be seen to be— in front, the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid ; behind, the anterior border of the trapezius. The apex, which is directed upwards, is formed at the superior curved line of the occipital bone by the apposition of the occipital attachments of these two muscles. The floor of that portion of the space exposed will be observed to be formed by the splenius capitis and the levator anguli scapulae. But it often happens that the occipital attachments of the sterno- mastoid and trapezius (more especially of the latter) are so poorly developed that they fail to meet on the superior curved line of the occipital bone. In this case a small portion of the complexus (readily recognised by the vertical direction of its fibres) will be noticed entering into the formation of the floor above the level of the splenius. The contents of the space in so far as they can be seen in the present position of the body, are-(i.) the glandule concate- nate • (2) the. great auricular and small occipital nerves as they appear at the posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid muscle; (3.) the spinal accessory nerve the cervical nerves to the trapezius, and one or two small nerves from the cervical plexus to the levator anguli scapulae.

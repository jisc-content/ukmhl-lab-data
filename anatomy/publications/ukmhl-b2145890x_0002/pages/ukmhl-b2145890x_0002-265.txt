247 THE TEMPORAL MUSCLE. muscle and extend upwards upon the squamous part of the temporal bone. The temporal branch of the temporo-malar nerve should likewise be traced to the point where it emerges from the minute aperture in the temporal surface of the malar bone. At this point it lies under cover of the temporal muscle. The pterygoid region may now be fully opened up by removing a portion of the ascending ramus of the lower jaw. Two horizontal cuts must be made ; one through the neck of the jaw, and the other immedi- ately above the level of the inferior dental foramen. To find the level of the latter, the handle of the forceps should be thrust forwards between the ramus and the subjacent soft parts, and carried downwards. Its progress will soon be arrested by the entrance of the inferior dental vessels and nerve into the foramen, and the lower border of the instrument will correspond with the line along which the bone should be cut. Both incisions should be made with the saw, until the outer table of the bone is cut through, and then the bone pliers may be employed to complete the division. Parts displayed by the above Dissection.— When the fat and areolar tissue are removed, the pterygoid muscles will come into view. The external pterygoid will be recognised from its extending hori- zontally backwards to the neck of the lower jaw ; the internal pterygoid bears very much the same relation to the inner aspect of the ascending ramus, as the masseter presents to its superficial surface. The great bloodvessel ,of the space — the internal maxillary—

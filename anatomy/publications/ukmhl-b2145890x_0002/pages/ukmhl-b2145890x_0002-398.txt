Begin by rendering it tense by means of a hook, and then remove carefully the mucous membrane from its upper and lower surfaces, and also from the anterior and posterior pillars of the fauces. The latter proceeding will expose the palato-glossus and the palato-pharyngeus muscles on each side. The palatine glands will be chiefly found on the upper surface of the soft palate, and around the uvula. The Palato-Glossus is a delicate muscular slip, which arises from the side of the posterior part of the tongue, and curves upwards and inwards to reach the under surface of the soft palate. Here its fibres spread out, and become continuous with the corre-

PHARYNGEAL APONEUROSIS. 375 Sinus of Morgagni.—This is the name which is applied to the semilunar space which intervenes between the upper crescentic margin of the superior constrictor and the basis cranii. The deficiency in the muscular wall of the pharynx at this point is compensated for by the increased strength of the pharyngeal aponeurosis. In contact with the outer surface of the aponeurosis, a little dissection will display two muscles belonging to the soft palate— viz., the levator palati, and the tensor palati. The levator is rounded and fleshy, and lies behind the tensor, which is flatter and more tendinous. The latter can readily be recognised, from its position in relation to the deep surface of the internal ptery- goid muscle, and from its tendon winding inwards under the hamular process. In the upper part of the space, close to the basis cranii, and in intimate relationship to the origin of the two muscles, will be seen the Eustachian tube. Pharyngeal Aponeurosis. — The pharyngeal aponeurosis is strongly marked in its upper part, and maintains the integrity of the wall of the pharynx where the muscular fibres are absent. As it is traced downwards it gradually becomes weaker, until it is ultimately lost as a distinct layer. It lies between the muscles and mucous membrane, and only comes to the surface where the muscles are absent. It is the principal means by which the pharynx is attached to the base of the skull. Thus it is fixed to the basilar process of the occipital bone, to> the apex of the

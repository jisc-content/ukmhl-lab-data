240 HEAD AND NECK. The cartilage of the aperture is bent upon itself and folded round the orifice of the nostril in front and laterallyâ€”posteriorly it is deficient. The outer part is of an oval form, and does not reach down to the margin of the nostril, nor backwards as far as the nasal notch of the superior maxilla. The interval between it and the bone is filled in by fibrous tissue in which one or two small islands of cartilage (the cartilagines minores vel sesamoideae) appear. In front, the bent part of cartilage comes into contact with its neighbour and forms the point of the nose. Internally, the inner part of the cartilage is in the form of a narrow strip which lies upon the lower part of the septal cartilage, and projects slightly below it so as to support the margin of the nostril upon this side. Its extremity is turned slightly outwards.

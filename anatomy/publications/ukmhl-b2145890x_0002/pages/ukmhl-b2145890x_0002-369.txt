351 VERTEBRAL JOINTS. body immediately above. Here the bony surfaces are coated with encrusting cartilage, and are separated by a synovial cavity protected on the outer side by a feeble capsular ligament (Fig. 38, a, a). The ligaments which bind the bodies of the five lower cervical vertebrae together are the direct continu- ation upwards of the anterior and the posterior common ligaments of the spine. In the removal of the spinal cord, the laminae of the vertebrae below the axis have been taken away so that very little dissection will be required to make out the connections of both of these ligaments. The anterior common ligament is a strong band placed in front of the vertebral bodies. It is more firmly fixed to the intervening intervertebral discs than to the bones. The posterior common ligament which lies on the posterior aspect of the vertebral bodies consti- tutes the anterior boundary of the spinal canal. In the cervical region it completely covers the bodies of the vertebrae and does not present the denticulated appearance which is so characteristic of it lower down. It is chiefly attached to the cartilaginous discs and the adjacent margins of the bones. Neural arches.—The neural arches of the lower five cervical vertebrae are bound together by («.) the articulations between the articular processes; (b.) ligamenta subflava; (c.) by interspinous ligaments; and (d.) intertransverse ligaments. The joints between the opposing articular processes are of the diarthrodial variety. The surfaces of bone are coated with encrusting cartilage ; there is a joint cavity lined by synovial membrane, and surrounded by

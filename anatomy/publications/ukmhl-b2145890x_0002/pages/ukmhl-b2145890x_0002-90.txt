74 HEAD AND NECK. part, where they are present in a rudimentary con- dition. In the neck they are arranged in pairs—two occupying each interspinous interval, with the exception of that between the axis and atlas. In the lumbar region they are also well marked and in pairs ; here they are attached to the whole length of the spinous processes. The inter-transverse muscles are strongly developed in the lumbar region, and occupy the entire length of the inter-transverse intervals. Additional rounded fasciculi may be observed passing between the accessory processes. These are termed the inter- accessorii. In. the dorsal region^inter-transverse muscles—very weak and poorly developed—are only found in the lower three or four spaces. In the cervical region the inter-transversales are present in pairs, but they will be examined at a sub- sequent period. Levatores Costarum.—These constitute a series of twelve fan-shaped muscles, which pass from the transverse processes to the ribs. To bring them thoroughly into view the longissimus dorsi, sacro- lumbal, and accessorius muscles should be removed. The first muscle of the series springs from the tip of the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra, and expanding as it proceeds downwards and outwards, is inserted into the outer border of the first rib, immedi- ately beyond the tubercle. Each of the succeeding muscles takes origin from the tip of a dorsal transverse

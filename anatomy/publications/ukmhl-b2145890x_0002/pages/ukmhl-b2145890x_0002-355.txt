CAPSULE OF TENON. 337 eyeball, in which it can glide with the greatest freedom. The tendons of the various ocular muscles are inserted into the eyeball within this capsule, and they gain its interior by piercing the membrane opposite the equator of the globe. The lips of the openings through which the four recti muscles pass are prolonged backwards upon the muscles, in the form of sheaths, very much in the same manner that the infundibuli- form fascia is prolonged upon the spermatic cord from the internal abdominal ring. These sheaths gradually become more and more attenuated, until at last they blend with the perimysium of the muscular bellies. In the case of the superior oblique the corresponding prolongation is only related to its reflected portion ; it reaches the pulley and there it ends by becoming attached to its margin. The sheath of the inferior oblique may be traced upon the muscle as far as the floor of the orbit. But Mr. Lockwood has recently pointed out that the inner or ocular edge of each of the four apertures through which the recti muscles pass is strengthened by a vertical slip of fibrous tissue, and to these he gives the name of " intra-capsular ligaments." The importance of these ligaments will be understood when we remember that the capsule of Tenon is at various points firmly bound to the bony wall of the orbit. They therefore act as pulleys, and protect the globe of the eye from pressure during contraction of the muscles. The aperture for the superior oblique is not furnished with an intra-capsular ligament, and it is doubtful PART III. Â£

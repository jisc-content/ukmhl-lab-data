Temporal Fascia.—The structures which cover and lie superficial to this fascia have already been examined in the dissection of the scalp (p. 1). They are the superficial fascia, the thin lateral part of the epicranial aponeurosis, the attrahens, and attollens aurem, and in front the outer part of the orbicularis palpebrarum. Ramifying upon it there are also numerous nerves and vessels. The nerves are the auriculotemporal, the temporal branches of the facial and the temporal branch of the temporo-malar : the PART Hi. R

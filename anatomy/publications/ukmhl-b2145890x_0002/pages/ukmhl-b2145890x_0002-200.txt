182 HEAD AND NECK. and ends by breaking up into twigs, which enter the substance of the thyroid body. The following branches proceed from it :â€” (i.) Hyoid. (4-) Crico-thyroid. (2.) Superior laryngeal. (5.) Thyroid. (3.) Sterno-mastoid. The hyoid is a minute twig, which springs from the superior thyroid before it leaves the carotid triangle, and runs transversely inwards under cover of the thyro- hyoid muscle, and along the lower border of the hyoid bone. It anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the hyoid branch of the lingual. The superior laryngeal artery is a larger vessel. It springs from the superior thyroid as it lies in the carotid triangle, and associating itself with the supe- rior laryngeal nerve, it enters the larynx by piercing the thyro-hyoid membrane. The sterno-mastoid artery is a small vessel which runs downwards and outwards across the carotid sheath, to reach the deep surface of the sterno-mastoid muscle, into which it sinks. It gives, in addition, minute twigs to the depressor muscles of the larynx, and its only claim to special description is the position it occupies in relation to the common carotid artery. The crico-thyroid artery runs inwards upon the crico- thyroid membrane, and anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side. It has already been noticed, in the dissection of the middle line of the neck (p. 142), and its bearing upon the operation of laryngotomy has been mentioned (p. 145)- The thyroid or terminal branches of the superior

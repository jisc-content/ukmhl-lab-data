Levator menti. 10. Buccinator. 4. Levator labii superioris alseque nasi. 5. Levator labii superioris. It is in dissecting these muscles that the chief difficulty will be encountered in preserving the various nerves of the face. Several large branches of the facial nerve will be found passing forwards under cover of the zygomatic muscles to reach the under- surface of the levator labii superioris, where they form a complicated plexus with the infra-orbital nerve. Other branches proceed forwards upon the buccinator muscle, and enter into communications in front of the masseter with the long buccal nerve. All these must be carefully followed out as the muscles are being exposed and cleaned. Orbicularis Oris—This is a sphincter muscle which surrounds the orifice of the mouth, and towards which the various muscles which play upon the lips converge. Like the corresponding muscle of the palpebral fissure we divide it for descriptive purposes, into two parts—an inner and an outer. The inner or labial part is the portion which lies in relation to the red part of the lips, and the degree of fulness or prominence of the lips largely depends upon its development. It is composed of fasciculi which completely encircle the oral fissure and have at no point a bony attachment.

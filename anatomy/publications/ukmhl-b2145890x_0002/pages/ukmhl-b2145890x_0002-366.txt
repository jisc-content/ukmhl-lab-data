348 HEAD AND NECK. sixth cervical vertebrae should then be snipped off by the bone pliers. The vertebral artery has pre- viously been traced to the point where it disappears through the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra; it is now seen to proceed vertically upwards through the vertebra-arterial foramina until it reaches the foramen in the transverse process of the axis. In this it is directed outwards in order that it may gain the more outwardly placed foramen of the atlas. Upon the upper surface of the atlas it again changes its direction and proceeds back- wards, behind the lateral mass, in a groove on the upper surface of the posterior arch of that bone. Finally, it turns forwards under the posterior occipito- atlantal ligament, pierces the dura mater, and enters the cranium through the foramen magnum. The vertebral artery is accompanied by the vertebral vein and by a sympathetic plexus of nerves derived from the inferior cervical ganglion. The anterior divisions of the lower six cervical nerves pass outwards behind it ; the corresponding division of the first cervical nerve passes forwards internal to it, whilst that of the second nerve turns forward upon its outer aspect; lastly, the posterior primary division of the first cervical nerve enters the suboccipital triangle of the neck by passing backwards between the artery and the neural arch of the atlas. The branches which are given off by the vertebral artery in the neck are of small size. They are {a) muscular, (b) lateral spinal. The muscular twigs go to the muscles in the

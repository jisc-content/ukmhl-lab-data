273 THE HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE. and are separated by a distinct interval. Of these, the posterior connecting twig is frequently in the form of two or three filaments, which convey to the ganglion its sensory and motor roots, whilst the anterior con- necting branch must be looked upon as a twig given by the ganglion to the lingual nerve. In common with the other ganglia developed in connection with the branches of the fifth cranial nerve, this ganglion has three roots—viz., (1.) a sensory root from the inferior maxillary nerve; (2.) a motor root from the chorda tympani; and (3.) a sympathetic root from the plexus around the facial artery. From its lower border several minute twigs proceed, and these are distributed—(1.) to the submaxillary gland ; (2.) to Wharton's duct; and (3.) to the mucous membrane of the mouth. The Hypoglossal Nerve has been traced in the dissection of the anterior triangle to the point where it disappears under cover of the mylo-hyoid muscle (p. 149). It is now seen passing forwards upon the hyo-glossus above the hyoid bone, and below the level of the deep part of the submaxillary gland. At the anterior border of the hyo-glossus it gains the surface of the genio-hyo-glossus, into the substance of which it sinks. Its further course is along the lower surface of the tongue, close to its fellow of the opposite side. Whilst the lingual nerve, therefore, clings to the side of the tongue, the hypoglossal is placed upon its under aspect, close to the mesial plane. Upon the hyo-glossus muscle it is accompanied by one of the part in. t

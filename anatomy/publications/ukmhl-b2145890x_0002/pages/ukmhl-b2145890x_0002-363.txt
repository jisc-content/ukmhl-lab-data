THE RECTUS CAPITIS ANTICUS MAJOR. 345 side of the upper oblique part of the muscle, by three tendinous processes, which obtain attachment to the bodies of the second, third, and fourth cervical vertebrae. The Rectus Capitis Anticus Major (Fig. 36, 1) is an elongated muscle which arises by four tendinous slips from the anterior tubercles of the tranverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae, and is inserted in front of the foramen magnum, upon the under aspect of the basilar process of the occipital bone. To reach this insertion the muscle inclines slightly inwards as it ascends upon the front of the vertebral column. It is supplied by twigs from the first loop of the cervical plexus. The Rectus Capitis Anticus Minor (Fig. 36, 2, and 37, b) is a very minute muscle. It is in great part concealed by the upper part of the preceding muscle, which should be detached from its insertion, and turned downwards so as to bring it fully into view. It arises from the anterior aspect of the root of the transverse process of the atlas, and proceeding upwards and inwards is inserted into the under surface of the basilar process of the occipital,bone behind the rectus capitis anticus major. It is supplied by a filament from the first loop of the cervical plexus. Before proceeding farther, the dissector should again revise the attachments of the scalene muscles, (v. p. 151).

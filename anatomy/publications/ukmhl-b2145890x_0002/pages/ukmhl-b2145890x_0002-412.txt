Otic Ganglion.â€”If the part has been well pre- served, the dissector should be able at this stage to expose the otic ganglion, and perhaps also some of its more important connections. Turn the specimen so that its inner surface looks upwards, and carefully detaching the levator palati from its origin throw it downwards. Then remove the cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube. In doing this, the dissector must proceed with the greatest caution, because the ganglion lies immediately subjacent. By following the nerve to the internal pterygoid muscle upwards and backwards to its origin the otic ganglion will be discovered. The otic ganglion is an oval, somewhat flattened body, the long axis of which runs in the antero- posterior direction, and measures 4 m.m. It is placed immediately below the foramen ovale, between the deep surface of the inferior maxillary nerve, and the cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube. The middle meningeal artery lies behind it. Two con- necting filaments bind it to the inferior maxillary nerve, and it either covers or surrounds the origin of the nerve to the internal pterygoid muscle. The otic ganglion is usually described as receiving motor, sensory, and sympathetic roots. The motor and sensory roots are, in all probability, both supplied by the nerve to the internal pterygoid muscle ; the sympathetic root comes from the plexus

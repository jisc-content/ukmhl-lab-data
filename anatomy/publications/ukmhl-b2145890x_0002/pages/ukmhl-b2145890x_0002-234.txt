HEAD AND NECK. 2l6 (b.) Reaching the face indirectly. 1. Communicating branches from the great auricular nerve to the facial. 2. Communicating branches from the auriculo-temporal to the facial. Whilst, therefore, the motor filaments come from one source alone, the sensory nerves are derived partly from the cervical plexus through the great auricular nerve, but chiefly from the fifth cranial nerve, each division of which furnishes several branches to the face. Facial Nerve.â€”This nerve is already, in a great measure, displayed. Its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen can be rendered more evident by chipping off the free projecting part of the mastoid process. In doing this first use the saw, and then complete its severance with the chisel. Care must be taken not to injure the posterior auricular branch of the facial. By this proceeding a good view can be obtained of the origin of the posterior belly of the digastric, of the stylo-mastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery entering the foramen of the same name upon the facial nerve, and also of the occipital artery in the deepest part of its course. The trunk of the facial nerve emerges from the stylo-mastoid foramen and proceeds forwards in the substance of the parotid gland. Near the posterior margin of the ascending ramus of the lower jaw, it ends by dividing into two branches termed respect- ively the tem^M^l and the cervicofacial divisions.

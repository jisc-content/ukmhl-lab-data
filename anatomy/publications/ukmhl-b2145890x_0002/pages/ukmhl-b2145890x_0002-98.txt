The last-mentioned branches each divide into an ascending and descending twig. These anastomose with the corresponding twigs of the artery above and below, and in this manner a continuous series of minute arterial arcades is formed. From these arcades, branches pass inwards upon the posterior aspect of the vertebral bodies, and join a small median longitudinal artery which extends along the anterior wall of the spinal canal. In the cervical region small branches from the ascending cervical artery also find their way into the spinal canal; whilst in the sacral portion of the canal, the dissector will find branches from the lateral sacral arteries. Intraspinal Veins.-These, sometimes termed the rachidian veins, are very large and very compli- cated in their arrangement. They may be considered to form a posterior and an anterior intraspinal plexus. The posterior intraspinal venous plexus consists of two main longitudinal vessels, united by many cross branches which run along the deep aspect of the neural arches and ligamenta subflava. Above, they communicate with the occipital sinus, whilst all the way down they are connected with the dorsal spinal venous plexus by wide channels which pierce the ligamenta subflava. Laterally they send branches through the intervertebral foramina to join the

115 TRIANGLES OF THE NECK. and complete the work with the co-operation of the dissector of the arm. The posterior triangle is a long narrow triangular space placed between the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid and the anterior border of the trape- zius. Its upper part has already been displayed in the dissection of the posterior aspect of the neck, but it can only be studied in its entirety when the subject is placed upon its back. Remove the deep cervical fascia which still covers its lower portion, and gradually dissect out the various structures within its area. The trapezius which has been reflected should be restored as far as possible to its natural position and retained by means of a stitch. Study the space systematically under the following heads : (1.) cover- ings ; (2.) boundaries; (3.) contents ; and (4.) floor. The Coverings have already been reflected. They are the superficial and deep fasciae of the neck, and, in the lower part of the space, the platysma. Certain cutaneous nerves and the external jugular vein have also been noticed in the superficial fascia as it stretches across this area. Near the occiput is the small occipital nerve; near the clavicle are the supra- clavicular descending branches of the cervical plexus, and a very short portion of the external jugular vein. The Boundaries are in front, the posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid, and behind, the anterior margin of the trapezius. The base which is below is formed by the middle third of the clavicle, whilst the apex which is above is formed by the meet-

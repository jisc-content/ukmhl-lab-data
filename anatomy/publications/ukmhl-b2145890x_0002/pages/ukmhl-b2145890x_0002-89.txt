DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 73 separated from the lumbar and sacral spines and drawn aside—if, indeed, this has not been already done in following out the nerves. In the lumbar and sacral regions, the multifldus will be seen to constitute a thick fleshy mass which clings closely to the vertebral spines. In this situa- tion it has a very extensive origin—viz. (i.) from the deep surface of the aponeurotic origin of the erector spinse; (2.) from the posterior surface of the sacrum as low as the fourth aperture ; (3.) from the posterior sacro-iliac ligament; (4.) from the posterior superior spine of the ilium; and (5.) from the mammillary pro- cesses of the lumbar vertebras. In the dorsal region it takes origin from the transverse processes of the vertebrae, and in the cervical region from the articular processes of at least four of the lower cervical vertebrae. It is inserted into the whole length of the various spinous processes of the vertebrae as high up as the axis. The Rotatores Spinae are eleven small muscles which may be exposed by raising the multifldus in the dorsal region. Each muscle springs from the root of a transverse process and is inserted into the lamina of the vertebra immediately above, close to the root of the spinous process. Inter-spinales and Inter-transversales. — The •dissector should next examine the minute inter- spinous and inter-transverse muscles. The interspinous muscles can hardly be said to exist in the dorsal region, except in its upper and lower

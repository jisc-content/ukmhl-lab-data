THE SUPERIOR CERVICAL GANGLION. 299 The sympathetic cord takes a vertical course through the neck in front of the roots of the transverse processes of the vertebrae. It lies upon the rectus capitis anticus major and the longus colli muscles, immediately behind the carotid sheath. Above, it is prolonged upwards in the form of a stout, ascending nerve-trunk, which accompanies the internal carotid artery into the carotid canal; below, it becomes continuous over the neck of the first rib and behind the subclavian artery with the thoracic portion of the sympathetic. The branches take origin from the ganglia; occasionally, however, one or more may be observed to arise from the connecting cords. The Superior Cervical Ganglion is the largest of the three ganglia. It is an elongated fusiform body which varies somewhat in size. It is placed upon the upper part of the rectus capitis anticus major, opposite the second and third vertebrae, and behind the carotid sheath. From its upper end the stout branch proceeds which enters the carotid canal, whilst its lower end tapers into the continuation downward of the cord. Numerous branches issue from it; of these some connect it with neighbouring nerves, whilst others are distributed in various ways. The connecting branches are:â€”(1.) slender fila- ments which connect it with the upper four cervical nerves; (2.) twigs to both ganglia of the vagus; (3.) to the petrous ganglion of the glossopharyngeal; and (4.) to the hypoglossal. It is in no way connected with the spinal accessory.

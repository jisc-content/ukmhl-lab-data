276 HEAD AND NECK. forwards along the upper border of the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and is covered by the hyo- glossus muscle which intervenes between it and the hypo-glossal nerve. The nerve, however, is placed at a slightly higher level. The deep or internal relations of the artery in this stage of its course are the middle constrictor of the pharynx and the genio- hyo-glossus. The third part ascends almost vertically upon the genio-hyo-glossus. It is overlapped by the anterior border of the hyo-glossus, and ends when it reaches the under surface of the tongue by turning forwards into its terminal or ranine branch. The branches of the lingual artery are :â€” 1. Hyoid from the first part (p. 183). 2. Dorsalis linguae from the second part. 3. Sublingual from the third part. 4. The ranine or terminal branch. The dorsalis Ungues is generally represented by two or more well-marked branches which pass upwards under cover of the hyo-glossus muscle to end in twigs to the mucous membrane, covering the back part of the dorsum of the tongue. Some twigs are also supplied to the muscular substance of the organ, and a few may be traced backwards into the tonsil. The sublingual artery emerges from under cover of the anterior border of the hyo-glossus and then ascends upon the genio-hyo-glossus to reach the sublingual gland which it supplies. It also gives branches to the surrounding muscles and anastomoses with its

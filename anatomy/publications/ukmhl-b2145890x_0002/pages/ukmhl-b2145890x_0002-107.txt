91 DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. Spinal Nerves.—Thirty-one spinal nerves take origin from each side of the spinal cord. These are classified into five groups, according to the vertebrae with which they are associated. The dorsal, lumbar, and sacral nerves correspond in number with the num- ber of vertebrae in each of these regions,—thus, there are twelve dorsal, five lumbar, and five sacral nerves, each of which issues from the spinal canal below the vertebra with which it numerically corresponds. In the cervical region, however, there are eight nerves, the first of which comes out between the occiput and the atlas, and is therefore distinguished by the special name of the sub-occipital nerve. One nerve only represents the coccygeal group. Spinal Nerve-Roots—(Fig. 15).—Each spinal nerve springs from the side of the spinal cord by two roots— an anterior and a posterior. Except in the case of the sub-occipital nerve (where, indeed, the posterior root is sometimes absent), the posterior nerve-root is the larger of the two. In addition to this, the posterior root is distinguished by possessing an oval ganglion, termed the spinal root-ganglion. There is, likewise, a wide physiological difference between the two roots— the posterior root is composed of sensory fibres, the anterior root consists of motor fibres. Immediately beyond the ganglion the two roots unite to form the spinal nerve-trunk, which, in consequence, contains a mixture of both motor and sensory nerve-fibres. The mode of origin of the two nerve-roots from the spinal cord is somewhat different. In each instance

461 THE LINGUAL PAPILLA. caecum, and divides the anterior two-thirds of the dorsum into two lateral parts. On the under surface of the tongue the mucous membrane is smooth and comparatively thin. In the mesial plane it forms the frcenum Ungues, which has been studied at an earlier stage. On either side of the median line the lingual vein may be noticed in the living subject stretching forwards towards the tip. To the outer side of this, and, therefore, somewhat nearer the border of the tongue, is a delicate and feebly marked fold of mucous membrane, from the free border of which a row of fringe-like processes or fimbriae project. It is termed the plica fimbriata, and as it extends forwards towards the tip of the tongue it inclines towards the mesial plane, and its neighbour of the opposite side. On the side of the tongue immediately in front of the lingual attachment of the anterior pillar of the fauces, five short vertical fissures in the mucous membrane separated by intervening folds may be noticed. This arrangement is termed the papilla foliata. It is the representative of a leaf-like condition of the mucous membrane, which is much more highly developed in certain of the lower animals (hare and rabbit), and which is specially concerned in receiving the impressions of taste. The Lingual Papillae are of three kinds, and differ in size, shape, and in the position they occupy on the surface of the tongue. They are termed the circum- yallate, the fungiform, and the conical. The circumvallate papillce are the largest, and are

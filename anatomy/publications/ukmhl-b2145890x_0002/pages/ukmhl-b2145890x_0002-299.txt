28l INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. carotid, and commences, therefore, at the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. From this point it proceeds upwards in the neck in a vertical direction, until it reaches the base of the skull ; here it disappears from view by entering the carotid canal of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, through which it reaches the interior of the cranium. The internal carotid artery can therefore be very appropri- ately divided into three parts—viz., (1.) a cervical ; (2.) a petrous ; and (3.) an intra-cranial. The cervical part alone comes under the notice of the student in the present dissection. In the first instance, the internal carotid artery is placed within the carotid triangle, and is, therefore, comparatively superficial. It is covered by the integ- ument, platysma, and fascia, and is overlapped by the sterno-mastoid muscle. As it proceeds upwards, it gradually sinks deeply, until it comes to lie under cover of the entire mass of the parotid gland, the styloid process, the stylo-pharyngeus, the stylo-hyoid, and the posterior belly of the digastric. Three nerves and two arteries will also be noticed to cross the vessel, viz. :— (1.) The hypoglossal. (1.) The occipital artery. (2.) The glossopharyngeal. (2.) The posterior auri- (3.) The pharyngeal branch cluar artery- of the vagus. The relationship of the external carotid artery to the internal carotid is a varying one. At first the external carotid lies in front of it, but soon owing to

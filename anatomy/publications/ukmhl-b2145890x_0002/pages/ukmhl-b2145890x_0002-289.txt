271 LINGUAL NERVE. its fellow of the opposite side. The duct of Wharton and the lingual nerve are prolonged forwards under cover of the sublingual gland. Numerous small ducts (the number varying from eight to twenty) proceed from the sublingual gland. These are called the ducts of Rivini, and they have two modes of termination. Some open into Wharton's duct; others open directly into the mouth by piercing the mucous membrane which overlies the gland. One of the latter, larger than the others, receives the special name of the duct of Bartholin, and this opens into the mouth close to the orifice of the duct of Wharton. Lingual Nerve.â€”In the dissection of the pterygo- maxillary region, the lingual nerve has been seen passing downwards between the ramus of the lower jaw and the internal pterygoid muscle. It now inclines forwards to reach the side of the tongue, and, passing over the superior constrictor muscle of the pharynx, it lies below the last molar tooth between the mucous membrane and the body of the lower jaw. At this point it is in. danger of being hurt by the clumsy extraction of one of the lower molars, and here also it may be divided by the surgeon, from the inside of the mouth. In its further course the nerve keeps close to the side of the tongue, crossing the upper part of the hyo-glossus, and, beyond this, the duct of Wharton. It can be traced as far as the tip of the tongue, and it is placed immediately under cover of the mucous membrane of the mouth.

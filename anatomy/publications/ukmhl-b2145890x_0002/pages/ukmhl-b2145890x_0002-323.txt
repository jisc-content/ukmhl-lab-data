DISSECTION OF THE MIDDLE CRANIAL FOSSA. 305 DISSECTION OF THE STRUCTURES IN THE LATERAL PART OP THE MIDDLE CRA- NIAL FOSSA. The following are the structures which must be displayed in this dissection :— (1.) Cavernous venous sinus. (2.) Internal carotid artery. (3.) Middle meningeal artery. (4.) Small meningeal artery. (5.) The two roots of the fifth nerve, with the Gasserian ganglion and the three main divisions of the fifth nerve. (6.) Occulo-motor nerve (3rd cranial). (7.) Trochlear nerve (4th cranial). (8.) Abducent nerve (6th cranial). (9.) Cavernous plexus of the sympathetic. (10.) Great superficial petrosal nerve, (n.) Small superficial petrosal nerve. Dissection.—To expose these structures, the dura mater must be stripped from the inner part of the lateral portion of the middle cranial fossa. Enter the knife at the anterior clinoid process, and carry it backwards to the apex of the petrous bone. This incision must go no deeper than is necessary to divide the dura mater, and must be made immediately to the outer side of the openings in the membrane through which the third, fourth, and fifth nerves pass. It is very important to preserve these apertures intact, so that the proximal ends of these nerves may be held in position during the dissection. The incision through the dura mater may now be carried along the upper border of the petrous bone in the line of the superior PART III. X

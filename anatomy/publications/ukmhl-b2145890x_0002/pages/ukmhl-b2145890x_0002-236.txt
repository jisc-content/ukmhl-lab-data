2i8 HEAD AND NECK. longed forwards through the parotid gland, and at once divides into numerous branches which radiate widely from each other, and stretch over an area extending from the ear behind to the margin of the upper lip below. Whilst within the substance of the parotid gland the temporo-facial nerve crosses the external carotid artery near its termination, and also the temporo-maxillary vein. It receives two, or it may be three, stout branches of communication from the auriculo-temporal nerve. The branches into which this portion of the facial trunk divides are classified according to the direction which they take intoâ€” 1. Temporal. 2. Malar. 3. Infra-orbital. The temporal branches, three or four in number, emerge from the upper border of the parotid, and are carried upwards over the zygomatic arch to the tem- poral region. Here they supply the attrahens aurem, the frontal belly of the occipito-frontalis, the orbi- cularis palpebrarum, and the corrugator superciln. They communicate with several branches of the fifth cranial nerve, more especially with the auriculo- temporal, the temporal branch of the orbital, and the supra-orbital. The malar branches run forwards upon the malar bone and end in filaments, which enter the outer and lower part of the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle. Some of the twigs may be traced to the upper and lower eyelids. On the malar bone they communicate

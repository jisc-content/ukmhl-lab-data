396 HEAD AND NECK. spongy. It is highly vascular, and contains numerous racemose glands. The minute orifices of the gland- ducts can be detected by the naked eye. Over the olfactory district of the septum, the mucous membrane is softer and more delicate, and not so thick. In the fresh state it presents a yellowish colour, and the glands are smaller and not so plentiful. In favourable cases a minute orifice may be detected in the mucous membrane on the lower and fore part of the nasal septum immediately behind the vestibular area. It is placed above the anterior end of a well-marked elongated projection which passes obliquely backwards and upwards, and corresponds to the thickened lower margin of the septal cartilage. This aperture varies in diameter from \ m.m., to 11 m.m. (Schwalbe). It leads into a narrow canal, which passes backwards for a short distance, and then ends blindly. It is of interest because it represents in the human subject the rudiment of the organ of Jacobson, a tubular structure which is highly developed in some of the lower animals. Construction of the Nasal Septum.â€”Strip the mucous membrane from the exposed surface of the septum nasi. By this proceeding the intimate connection which exists between the mucous mem- brane and the subjacent periosteum and perichondrium will become apparent, and the parts forming the septum will be rendered visible. The bulk of the partition is composed of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid and the vomer posteriorly, and of the

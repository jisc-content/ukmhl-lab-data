INTRAPETROUS PORTION OF FACIAL NERVE. 423 4. A part which extends vertically downwards to the stylo-mastoid foramen. First stage.—In the internal auditory meatus, the facial nerve runs almost directly outwards in company with the auditory nerve and the pars intermedia. In this stage of its course it lies in relation to the upper and fore part of the auditory nerve, and is joined by the pars intermedia. At the bottom of the auditory meatus it enters the aqueduct of Fallopius. Second stage.—The second part of the facial nerve is very short It runs outwards with a slight inclina- tion forwards between the vestibule and cochlea, and very soon ends in the swelling termed the geniculate ganglion. Third stage.—At the geniculate ganglion, the facial nerve bends suddenly and then proceeds backwards and slightly downwards in that portion of the aque- duct which runs along the upper part of the inner wall of the tympanum, immediately above the fora- men ovale. The first three portions of the facial nerve are nearly horizontal, and pursue a somewhat V-snaPed course. The apex of the V is directed forwards, and corresponds to the geniculate ganglion. The fourth stage is vertical, and arches downwards behind the pyramid to gain the stylo-mastoid foramen. The branches which spring from the facial nerve during its passage through the temporal bone are:—

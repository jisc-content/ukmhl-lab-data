OUTER WALL OF THE NASAL FOSSA. 403 extensive communication which existed in the embryo between the cavities of the nose and the mouth. Outer Wall of the Nasal Fossa.â€”The outer wall of the nasal cavity is rendered uneven and complicated by the projection of the three turbinated bones. In front it is formed by the lateral cartilage, the cartilage of the aperture, the nasal bone, and the ascending process of the superior maxillary bone. Behind these, the lachrymal, the ethmoid, and the inferior turbinated bones, with a small portion of the body of the superior maxillary bone, enter into its construction ; whilst still farther back, are the vertical plate of the palate bone and the internal pter- ygoid plate of the sphenoid. Placed in relation to the outer aspect of this wall are the ethmoidal air-cells, which intervene between the upper part of the nasal cavity and the orbit, whilst at a lower level the great air-sinus of the superior maxillary bone, termed the antrum of Highmore, is situated immediately to the outer side of the nasal fossa (Fig. 45). The part which the different bones take in the formation of the outer wall of the cavity of the nose must in the first place be studied in a sagittal section through the macerated skull, and the dissector should constantly refer to such a preparation during the dissection. Turning now to the recent specimen, the dissector will observe that the outer wall may very readily be sub- divided into three areas or districts. These are: (1.) the vestibule, (2.) the atrium meatus medii, (3.) the region of the turbinated bones and intervening meatuses.

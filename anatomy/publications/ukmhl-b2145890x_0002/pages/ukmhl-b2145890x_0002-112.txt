96 HEAD AND NECK. Arteries of the Spinal Cord.â€”It is only in cases where a paint injection has been used that the spinal arteries can be made out satisfactorily. Upon the anterior aspect of the cord in the mesial plane, a slender vessel runs downwards, under cover of the linea splendens of the pia mater. Its calibre is uniform throughout, and where the cord ends, it pro- ceeds onwards into the sacral canal upon the filum terminale. It is not formed by a single vessel, but by a series of inosculating arteries. In its upper part it is constituted by the two anterior spinal arteries which spring from the vertebral within the cranium, and converging upon the anterior face of the medulla oblongata, unite at the level of the foramen magnum. Lower down, the continuity of this single median vessel is maintained by twigs which reach the spinal cord upon the anterior nerve-roots. These twigs in the neck come from the spinal branches of the verte- bral, ascending cervical, and deep cervical arteries ; in the dorsal and lumbar regions, from the spinal twigs of the dorsal branches of the intercostal and lumbar arteries, and from the ilio-lumbar artery; in the sacral region, from the spinal twigs of the lateral sacral arteries. Upon the posterior aspect of the cord, two long, slender, arterial trunks proceed downwards, one upon either side, behind the line of emergence of the fasci- culi which go to build up the posterior nerve-roots. Opposite the first or second lumbar vertebra these arteries terminate. Like the anterior arterial trunk, the posterior arteries are formed by a continuous series

THE SUPERIOR THYROID ARTERY. l8l So much then for the superficial relations of this vessel. There are others which also deserve attention. Observe that at its commencement, it lies in relation to the pharynx, and that higher up it rests upon the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, the styloid process and the glossopharyngeal nerve, and that these three structures intervene between it and the internal carotid. As the external carotid ascends, it diminishes rapidly in calibre, owing to the numerous large branches which it gives off. It is customary to classify these, according to the direction which they take, into the following groups : Superior thyroid, Lingual, Facial, Internal maxillary, Occipital, . Posterior auricular, i Directed forwards and inwards. [ Directed backwards and ) outwards. Ascending pharyngeal, ) Directed almost vertically Superficial temporal, . J upwards. But these are not the only branches which come off from the external carotid. Small twigs are also given to the parotidgland, and to the masseter and internal pterygoid muscles. The Superior Thyroid Artery arises within the carotid triangle, from the fore part of the external carotid close to its origin. From this it takes a curved course downwards and forwards, under cover of the omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and sternothyroid muscles,

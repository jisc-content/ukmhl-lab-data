80 HEAD AND NECK. multifidus spinae must also be completely removed from the back of the sacrum. At the same time the posterior primary divisions must be retained, so that their continuity with the various spinal nerve- trunks may be afterwards established. The posterior wall of the spinal canal should now be removed in o?ie piece by sawing through the laminae of the vertebrae on either side, and dividing the ligamenta subflava, from the third cervical vertebra down to the lower opening of the canal on the back of the sacrum. In making this dissection the student must attend to the following points:â€”(i.) the cut should be directed through the laminae close to the inner side of the articular processes ; (2.) the saw must be used upon an oblique plane, so that the cut through the laminae slants slightly inwards ; (3.) in cutting through the cervical laminae the head and neck should hang freely over the end of the table, and be pressed as far forwards as possible whilst the saw is worked from below upwards; (4.) in the case of the lumbar region, where indeed most difficulty will be met, a high block must be placed under the abdomen of the subject, whilst the blocks supporting the chest and pelvis-are removed. It will probably be necessary at this point to have recourse to the hammer and chisel. The laminae and spinous processes which are thus removed are connected with each other by the liga- menta subflava and the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments. They should therefore be laid aside for the present. A description of these ligaments will be found farther on. When the specimen is fresh, how-

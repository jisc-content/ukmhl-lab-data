107 SIDE OF THE NECK. not so much the skin of the neck as the integument over the upper part of the front of the chest and over the shoulder. To gain this destination they are carried downwards over the clavicle and acromion process, and are classified into three groups according to their position—viz. (1.) supra-acromial; (2.) supra- clavicular ; (3.) supra-sternal—Fig. 16 (17, 16, 24). Infra-Maxillary Division of Facial Nerve- After emerging from the parotid gland this nerve pierces the deep fascia. It will be found immediately below the angle of the lower jaw. Its branches spread forwards and form a series of loops which extend as low down as the hyoid bone. It is the nerve of supply to the platysma muscle, and effects a free communica- tion with the upper branch of the superficial cervical nerve—Fig. 16 (22). Deep Cervical Fascia—Fig. 17.—The cervical fascia should now be cleaned, and its connections studied. It constitutes a continuous and strong aponeurotic envelope for the neck, very much in the same manner that the brachial aponeurosis invests the upper arm or the fascia lata the thigh. As in the case of these fasciae also, processes are given off from its deep surface which penetrate into the neck to form sheaths for the various structures enclosed within the general investment. Certain of these processes stretch across the mesial plane in the form of partitions or septa, which subdivide the neck into fascial compartments. Let us first examine the general envelope as.it is at present displayed, and then we

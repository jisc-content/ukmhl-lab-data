246 HEAD AND NECK. coronoid process of the lower jaw; the deep part of the muscle remains fleshy, and gains attachment to the inner surface of the same bony prominence by an insertion which reaches as low down as the point where the anterior margin of the ramus merges into the body of the jaw. Dissection.â€”The next step in the dissection of this region consists in separating the coronoid process from the lower jaw, and turning it upwards with the attached temporal muscle. A very oblique cut is required ; it should extend from the centre of the sigmoid notch above, downwards, and forwards, to the point where the anterior margin of the ascending ramus meets the body of the lower jaw. First use the saw, and then complete the division with the bone pliers. The long buccal nerve and its companion artery are in a position of great danger during this dissection, and must be carefully guarded. They proceed downwards and forwards under cover of the lower part of the temporal muscle, and not unfre- quently the nerve will be found traversing its sub- stance. The coronoid process and the temporal muscle should be thrown well upwards, and the muscular fibres separated by the handle of the knife, from the bone forming the lower part of the temporal fossa. This will bring into view the deep temporal nerves and arteries as they ascend between the cranial wall and the muscle. This is the time also to follow the middle temporal artery (branch of the superficial temporal). It will be noticed to give branches to the

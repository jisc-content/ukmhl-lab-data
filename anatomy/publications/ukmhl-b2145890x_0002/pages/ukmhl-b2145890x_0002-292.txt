274 HEAD AND NECK. lingual veins, frequently termed the satellite vein of the hypoglossal nerve. The branches which spring from the hypoglossal nerve in this region are very numerous, and are entirely distributed to muscles. It supplies—(i.) the stylo-glossus ; (2.) the hyo-glossus; (3.) the genio- hyo-glossus; (4.) the genio-hyoid ; and (5.) the in- trinsic muscles of the tongue. In addition, it communicates freely with the lingual nerve. The more apparent of these connections the student has already observed to take place in the form of one or more loops in relation to the anterior border of the hyo-glossus. Other communications with the same nerve are effected in the substance of the tongue. Reflection of the Hyo-glossus.—The hyo-glossus should now be carefully detached from the hyoid bone, and thrown upwards towards the tongue. In doing this there is no need to divide the structures which lie upon its surface. By the reflection of this muscle the following structures will be fully displayed—(1.) the second and third stage of the lingual artery, with its dorsalis linguse branch and the veins which accompany it; (2.) the posterior part of the genio-hyo-glossus; (3.') the origin of the middle constrictor of the pharynx ; and (4.) the attachment of the stylo-hyoid ligament. •The Genio-hyo-Glossus is a flat triangular muscle, the inner surface of which is in contact in the

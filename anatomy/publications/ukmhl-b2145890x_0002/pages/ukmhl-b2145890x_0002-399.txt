SOFT PALATE. 33i sponding fasciculi of the opposite side. It forms the lowest muscular stratum of the soft palate. The Palato - Pharyngeus forms two muscular strata in the soft palate which enclose between them the azygos uvulae and the levator palati muscles. The upper layer is very weak, and confined to the posterior part of the velum. It constitutes the most superficial muscular stratum on this aspect of the pal- ate, and becomes continuous with the corresponding portion of the muscle of the opposite side. The deeper layer takes origin from the posterior margin of the palate bone and from the palatal aponeurosis, while some of its fibres mingle with those of the correspond- ing muscle of the opposite side. Outside the soft palate the two strata come together, and are joined by one or two delicate muscular slips which spring from the lower border of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube. These slips are sometimes described as the salpingo-pharyngeus muscle. The palato- pharyngeus thus formed arches downwards and back- wards in the posterior pillar of the fauces to reach the stylo-pharyngeus with which it is inserted into the superior and posterior borders of the thyroid cartilage. Some of its fibres, however, incline backwards and are inserted into the pharyngeal aponeurosis. Azygos Uvulse.â€”This delicate muscle is placed on the upper aspect of the soft palate, and posteriorly it is covered by the superficial fibres of the palato- pharyngeus. These must be removed to expose it

SUPERIOR OBLIQUE MUSCLE. 323 as the blow-pipe is withdrawn. At the back of the eyeball the dissector will notice a quantity of loose bursal-like tissue. This is the Capsule of Tenon. Seize the upper part of this with the forceps, and remove a small portion with a pair of scissors. An aperture is thus made into the capsule, and the handle of the knife can be introduced into the space between it and the eyeball. In favourable cases the extent of the capsule can be gauged, and perhaps even the prolongations or sheaths which it gives to the tendons of the ocular muscles made out. The description of the capsule of Tenon is given in p. 336. Rectus' Superior.â€”The rectus superior, which lies under cover of the levator palpebral supefioris, is now fully exposed. It arises from the upper margin of the optic foramen, and passing forward above the optic nerve, ends upon the upper aspect of the eye- ball in a thin, delicate tendon, which expands somewhat to be inserted into the sclerotic coat about three or four lines behind the sclero-corneal junction. It is supplied by a branch from the superior division of the third nerve. The Superior Oblique Muscle arises from the roof of the orbit immediately in front of the upper and inner part of the optic foramen, and extends forwards along the inner wall of the cavity above the internal rectus. At the fore-part of the orbit it ends in a slender tendon, which enters the pulley ' and at once changes its direction. It now proceeds

TEMPORO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATION. 253 the masseter, and unites with the facial vein. Entering its upper part are one or more minute emissary veins from the cavernous sinus. These gain the exterior of the cranium by passing through the foramen ovale. It likewise communicates with the ophthalmic vein through the spheno-maxillary fissure. Temporo-Maxillary Articulation—This joint must next be studied, in order that the external pterygoid muscle may be thrown forwards. In connection with it we find :— Ligaments Proper. Accessory Ligaments. 1. The external lateral. 1. Internal lateral. 2. The capsular. 2. Stylo-maxillary. An Inter-articular fibro-cartilage. The external lateral ligament is a strong band which is attached above to the outer surface of the posterior part of the zygomatic arch, and to the tubercle, at the root of the zygoma. It is composed of short parallel fibres, which proceed obliquely down- wards and backwards to be inserted into the outer and hinder part of the neck of the lower jaw. The capsule of the joint consists of a few scattered fibres, which support the synovial membranes upon the inner, anterior, and posterior aspects of the arti- culation. The internal lateral ligament is a long membranous band which springs from the spinous process of the

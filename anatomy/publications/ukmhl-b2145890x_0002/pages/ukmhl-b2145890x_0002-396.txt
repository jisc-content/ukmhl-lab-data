378 HEAD AND NECK. The orifices of the Eustachian tubes are placed one on either side of the pharynx, behind the lower part of the posterior nares. The level at which these apertures lie, may be said to correspond closely with that of the posterior extremities of the inferior turbin- ated bones. The orifice of the Eustachian tube is. bounded above and on the inner or posterior side, by a high rounded prominent margin, which is altogether deficient below and externally—a condition of affairs which favours very materially the passage of the Eustachian catheter* Below the soft palate there are three mesial open- ings into the pharynx—viz, the opening of the fauces, the opening of the larynx and the opening into the oesophagus. The isthmus faucium has already been studied from the front, and its boundaries have been described. It should now be carefully examined from behind, and the dissector should notice how greatly the size of the aperture varies in accordance to the position of the soft palate, p. 367. The laryngeal opening is placed below the isthmus faucium. It is a large obliquely placed aperture, which slopes from above downwards and backwards. Somewhat triangular in form, it is broadest in front; here it is bounded by the uprightly placed epiglottis. Behind it is narrow, and ends in the interval between * An Eustachian catheter can be very readily improvised by bending the extremity of an ordinary blowpipe. The d.ssector is recommended to practise the passage of this instrument into the Eustachian tube through the nose.

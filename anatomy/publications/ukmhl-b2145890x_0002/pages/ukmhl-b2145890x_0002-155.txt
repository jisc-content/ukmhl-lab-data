TRIANGLES OF THE NECK. 137 point of bifurcation of the common carotid, a small oval body, termed the intercarotic body, will be found closely applied to the vessel, Fig. 21 (25). The branches of the external carotid which take origin in the area of this triangle run for only a very short part of their course within it. Three branches will be noticed springing from the anterior aspect of the external car- otid. These are from below upwards : (1.) the superior thyroid, which disappears under cover of the omo- hyoid after having given off its hyoid, superior laryngeal, and sterno-mastoid branches, and enters the muscular triangle; (2.) the lingual, which leaves the space by passing under cover of the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles ; and (3.) the facial, which ascends under the same muscles to gain the digastric triangle. The occipital artery commonly springs from the posterior aspect of the external carotid, close to the lower border of the digastic, and soon quits the space by running upwards and backwards under the sterno-mastoid. Its sterno-mastoid branch comes off as it leaves the triangle, and accompanies the spinal accessory nerve. The ascending pharyngeal artery will be found by separating the external and internal carotid arteries from each other, and dissecting between them. It springs from the posterior aspect of the former about half-an-inch above its origin. The internal jugidar vein will be found lying close to the outer side of the common carotid artery, and included within the same fascial sheath. Its various tributaries which enter this space should be traced to itâ€”a dissection which requires both care and patience. The nerves within the carotid triangle, as will be

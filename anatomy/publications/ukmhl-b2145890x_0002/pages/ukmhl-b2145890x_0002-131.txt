TRIANGLES OF THE NECK. 113 a fleshy mass which ascends to the mastoid process and occiput. Here the muscle expands somewhat. In front it is thick and tendinous, and is inserted into the fore part and outer surface of the mastoid process; behind, it is thin and aponeurotic, and is inserted into rather more than the outer half of the superior curved line of the occipital bone. In the dissection of the back, this latter part of the muscle has been detached from the occiput. Posterior Triangleâ€”The posterior triangle should be dissected first. For this purpose the shoulder must be depressed and the head pulled well over to the opposite side and supported upon a block. This interferes, of course, with the dissection of the axilla. It is necessary, therefore, that the dissectors of the head and neck, and of the upper limb, should arrange to work at different hours. Again, the lower part of the posterior triangle, and the upper part of the axilla, constitute a region of the highest importance to both dissectors, seeing that it is here the great blood- vessels and nerves leave the root of the neck and enter the arm. Arrangements, therefore, must be made for each to have an opportunity of studying these structures. But in this a difficulty arises. Four days are required to complete the dissection of the axilla, whilst two days are amply sufficient for the dissection of the superficial parts of the neck and the posterior triangle. It is not necessary, however, that the dissector of the head and neck should stop work. After he has displayed the parts in the space part 111. I

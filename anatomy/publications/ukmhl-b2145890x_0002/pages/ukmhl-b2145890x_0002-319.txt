THE INFERIOR CERVICAL GANGLION. 3° The Middle Cervical Ganglion is the smallest of the three ganglia of the neck. It is placed opposite the sixth cervical vertebra in close proximity to the inferior thyroid artery, upon which, indeed, it not unfrequently rests. It gives off the following branches :— (i.) Twigs which connect it with the fifth and sixth spinal nerves, and which pass between the con- tiguous margins of the scalenus anticus and longus colli. (2.) Thyroid branches which run to the thyroid body along the inferior thyroid artery, and which form connections with the external and recurrent laryngeal nerves. (3.) The middle cardiac nerve. On both sides the middle cardiac nerve enters the thorax and is lost in the deep cardiac plexus. In the neck it is connected with the superior cardiac nerve, and with the recurrent laryngeal nerve. On the right side it passes behind or in front of the subclavian artery; on the left side it is continued downwards between the common carotid and subclavian arteries. The Inferior Cervical Ganglion is lodged in the interval between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib. In this position it lies behind the vertebral artery. It is by no means uncommon to find it more or less completely fused over the neck of the first rib with the first thoracic ganglion. Again, the

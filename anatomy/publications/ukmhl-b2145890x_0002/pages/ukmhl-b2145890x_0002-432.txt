414 HEAD AND NECK. nerves. One branch of this vessel—the naso-palatinc —accompanies the latter nerve, whilst others are distributed upon the outer wall of the cavity. Several twigs are also given by the descending palatine branch of the internal maxillary and the two ethmoidal arteries, but these are small and will only be seen in cases where the injection of the subject has been unusually successful. SPHENOPALATINE GANGLION OR THE GANGLION OP MECKEL. Dissection.—Meckel's ganglion is placed on the outer side of the spheno-palatine foramen, and can best be exposed at this stage by dissecting from the inside. The mucous membrane has already been removed from the posterior part of the outer wall of the nasal fossa, and the inferior nasal branches of the great palatine nerve have been found piercing the vertical plate of the palate bone. The dissector can- not fail to notice the course taken by the trunk from which these filaments arise. The lamina of bone which forms the inner wall of the posterior palatine canal is so thin that the nerve can be distinctly seen through it. By carefully opening up this canal with a chisel, and following the great palatine nerve upwards,' the dissector will be led to the ganglion in the sphenomaxillary fossa. The naso-palatme nerve should at the same time be traced to its origin. The ganglion is so hemmed in by the bony walls of the fossa that it is very difficult to display it

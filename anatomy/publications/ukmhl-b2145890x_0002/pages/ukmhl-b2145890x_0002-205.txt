THE POSTERIOR AURICULAR ARTERY. The muscular twigs are given to the neighbouring muscles, and one of them, larger than the others and very constant, is termed the sterno-mastoid branch, because it associates itself with the spinal accessory- nerve, and sinks with it into the substance of the sterno-mastoid muscle. The meningeal branch associates itself with the internal jugular vein, and can be followed upwards upon it to the jugular foramen, through which it passes into the cranium. The Posterior Auricular Artery will be found above the level of the posterior belly of the digastric, and, like the occipital, it takes origin from the hinder aspect of the external carotid artery. In the first part of its course it is placed deeply, and runs up- wards and backwards upon the styloid process of the temporal borte to reach the interval between the mastoid process and the back of the auricle. Here it joins the posterior auricular nerve, and its further course has been studied in the dissection of the scalp (p. n). Before gaining this point it lies under cover of the lower portion of the parotid gland, and is crossed by the facial nerve. This portion of the posterior auricular artery gives offâ€”(i.) muscular twigs; (2.) a few branches to the parotid gland ; and (3.) the stylo-mastoid artery. The stylo-mastoid artery is a slender vessel which enters the stylo-mastoid foramen upon the facial nerve. In the interior of the temporal bone it has an extensive distribution. It supplies twigs to the mastoid

234 HEAD AND NECK. outwards it divides at the inner canthus into two diverging portions which are attached one upon each tarsal plate. The superficial surface of the tendo oculi is covered by integument alone, the deep surface crosses the lachrymal sac a short distance above its centre and gives [to it a fibrous expansion, which is attached behind to the posterior margin of the lachrymal groove. Levator Palpebrae Superioris.—The dissection of the lower lid is now completed, but in the case of the upper eyelid the dissector must proceed to detach carefully the superior palpebral ligament from the margin of the orbit, and throw it downwards towards the tarsal plate. This will expose the tendon of the levator palpebrae superioris—a muscle which arises within the cavity of the orbit, and is inserted into the superior tarsal plate. Vessels and Nerves of the Eyelids.—These ramify for the most part between the palpebral part of the orbicularis and the palpebral ligaments. At the inner canthus two arteries—the palpebral branches of the ophthalmic artery-appear and run outwards in the upper and lower lids. At the outer margin of the orbit, one or more branches of the lachrymal artery pierce the palpebral ligament, and anastomose with the palpebral arteries. The veins run inwards towards the root of the nose, and open into the frontal and angular veins.

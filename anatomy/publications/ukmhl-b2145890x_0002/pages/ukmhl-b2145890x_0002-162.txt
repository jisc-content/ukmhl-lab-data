The thyroidea tma is an occasional branch of the innominate artery When present it passes vertically upwards m front of the trachea to the isthmus of the thyroid gland. Examine, in the next place, the parts which sepa- rate the trachea, and those structures in immediate relation to its anterior aspect from the surface. The two anterior jugular veins, as they run downwards in the superficial fascia, one upon either side of the mesial plane, have been already noticed; ata* he two layers of the deep cervical fascia close to the uooer margin of the sternum, with the cross-branch conn cdng the two anterior jugular veins between hem Behind the fascial envelope of the neck come L two muscular strata formed by the sterno-hyoid and the sterno-thyroid muscles. The inner margms of the sterno-hyoid muscles are almost contiguous above and held together by the fascial sheathes which t lose them ; below, however, they diverge very ■ Hghtly. so as to expose, close to the sternum ti* mner margins of the sterno-thyroid separate Sttwl™: rcE o-rave:: the trachea is not covered bv any muscular structure. , „ * „ The surgical interest attached to the SZgif. of"TnS dependf upon the fact that it is in this ^ Z IOF^t s Sf pharyngotomy, .aryngo.omy, and tracheotomy are performed.

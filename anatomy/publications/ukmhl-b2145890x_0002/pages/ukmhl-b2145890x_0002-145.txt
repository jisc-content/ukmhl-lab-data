127 TRIANGLES OF THE NECK. the levator anguli scapulae. It here meets the posterior scapular artery, and proceeds with it downwards under cover of the rhomboid muscles close to the base of the scapula. It supplies one or two twigs to the levator anguli scapulae, and is finally exhausted in the rhomboids. The nerve to the subclavhis is a minute twig which springs from the upper trunk of the plexus, and then passes vertically downwards upon the plexus, and across the subclavian artery to the subclavius muscle, which it reaches by piercing the posterior lamina of its sheath. A communication between the nerve to the subclavius and the phrenic is by no means uncommon. This connecting filament may join the phrenic in the neck, or it may even enter the chest for this purpose. In all probability, it represents that communicating twig (or at least a portion of it) which on other â€¢occasions passes directly from the fifth cervical nerve to the phrenic. The supra-scapular nerve is the largest branch given off above the clavicle. It springs from the upper trunk and runs downwards, outwards, and backwards, at a higher level than the brachial nerves, to the supra-scapular notch of the scapula, through which it enters the supra-spinous fossa. As it approaches the scapula it passes under cover of the tra- pezius and posterior belly of the omo-hyoid, and comes into relation with the artery of the same name. The external respiratory nerve of Bell, also called the posterior thoracic, is formed in the midst of the

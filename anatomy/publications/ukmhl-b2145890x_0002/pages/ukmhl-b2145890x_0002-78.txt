Indeed, no less than five structures lie superficial to it. These are (enumerating them in order from the vessel outwards)â€”(i.) the origin of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle ; (2.) the mastoid process ; (3.) the trachelo-mastoid ; (4.) the Trapezius.

Issu- ing from under the posterior border of this muscle, the artery crosses the apex of the posterior triangle, and disappears under the trapezius, which it finally * It is not uncommon to find the artery at this point of its course nearer the surface. In this case it passes backwards between the splemus and the trachelo-mastoid.

The latter, indeed, may be looked upon as constituting its upper, thickened, free border. In contact with its outer surface are the lateral crico - arytenoid and the thyro-arytenoid muscles, whilst its inner surface is clothed by the lining mucous membrane of the larynx. The Inferior Thyro-arytenoid Ligament or true vocal cord is formed in connection with the upper free \

The root, or broad posterior extremity of the tongue, is attached to the hyoid bone ; in front, the pointed extremity is free. The dorsal aspect of its base forms the lower boundary of the isthmus faucium, and is surmounted on each side by the tonsil. Mucous Membrane.â€”The lingual mucous mem- brane is a part of the general mucous lining of the buccal cavity, and it envelops the dorsum, sides, tip, and under surface of the tongue. It presents different appearances in different localities. Thus over the posterior part of the dorsum, in the region which is bounded behind by the epiglottis, and on either side by the tonsil, the mucous membrane is smooth, and presents no papillae which are visible to the unaided eye. It is from this district that the three glosso- epiglottidean folds take origin, and every here and there the surface is studded with low projections which are produced by lymphoid follicles, placed sub- jacent to the mucous membrane. About an inch or so in front of the epiglottis, a median depression termed the foramen ccecum may be noticed, and in front of this the mucous membrane which covers the dorsum, sides, and tip of the tongue is beset with papillae of different kinds. As these are individually visible to the naked eye, the mucous membrane presents a very characteristic appearance. Further a mesial groove or sulcus called the raphe, extends backwards from the tip of the tongue to the foramen

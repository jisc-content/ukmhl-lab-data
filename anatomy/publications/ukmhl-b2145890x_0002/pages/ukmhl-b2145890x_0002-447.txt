INTERIOR OF THE LARYNX. 429 called the vestibule. It is bounded in front by the epiglottis and the upper part of the angular depression between the alas of the thyroid cartilage, behind by the arytenoid cartilages and the mucous membrane which stretches across the mesial plane between them, and on each side by the aryteno-epiglottidean folds. The width of this portion of the laryngeal cavity diminishes from above downwards and its depth diminishes in a marked degree from before backwards. Above, it communicates with the pharynx by the superior aperture of the larynx, whilst below it is continuous with the middle subdivision of the cavity through the interval between the false vocal cords. The superior aperture of the larynx (ostium pharyn- geum laryngis) has already been examined in the dissection of the pharynx (p. 378). The parts which bound it should again be carefully studied. The epiglottis projects upwards behind the root of the tongue. Its lingual or anterior surface is only free in the upper part of its extent, and is attached to the back part of the tongue by a prominent mesial fold of mucous membrane termed the middle glosso- epiglottidean fold. Two lateral folds are also present which connect its margins with the tongue ; these are called the lateral glosso-epiglottidean folds. Between the two layers of mucous membrane which constitute each of these three frasnula, a small amount of elastic tissue may be found. The posterior free surface of the epiglottis forms, as we have noted, the greater part of the anterior boundary of the vestibule of the larynx.

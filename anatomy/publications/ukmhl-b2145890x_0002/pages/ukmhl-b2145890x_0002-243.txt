225 ARTERIES OF THE FACE. cover of the depressor anguli oris to supply the parts in connection with the chin and lower lip. It anastomoses with the mental, the terminal branch of the submental and the inferior coronary arteries. It is also connected with the corresponding arteries of the opposite side. The inferior coronary takes origin opposite the angle of the mouth, and runs inwards in the lower lip near its free margin between the mucous mem- brane and the labial part of the orbicularis oris. In a well injected subject it will be seen shining through the mucous membrane when the lip is everted. It anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side and with the inferior labial. The superior coronary takes origin under cover of the zygomaticus major, and is related to the upper lip in the same manner that the inferior coronary is related to the lower lip. It is generally of larger size, and this on account of two reasonsâ€”viz., (1.) because it is the sole branch of supply to the upper lip ; and (2.) because it undertakes in a measure the supply of the lower part of the nose. The branch which it gives off for this latter purpose is called the septal artery; it runs along the lower border of the nasal septum and distributes twigs as far as the tip of the nose. The lateral nasal artery is a branch which is given to the side of the nose, and as a rule passes forwards under cover of the levator labii superioris ala^que nasi. The angular artery is the name that is applied to the terminal part of the facial artery. PART III. q

TRIANGLES OF THE NECK. 121 Although, as a rule, no branch springs from this portion of the subclavian, it is not uncommon to find the posterior scapular artery taking direct origin from its upper surface. Surgical Anatomy.—The dissector should again examine the relations of the subclavian artery, with the view of determin- ing those which would constitute the most trustworthy guides in cases where it is necessary to apply a ligature to its third part. He should note that the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid will give no information beyond that of the depth at which the operator has arrived. The true guide is the older border of the scalenus anticus muscle. This, as a rule, lies immediately behind the posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid. By passing the forefinger downwards along the outer margin of the scalenus anticus, the scalene ttcbercle on the first rib will be reached. When the finger-nail rests on this tubercle the finger-pulp is applied to the artery, and in the living subject will feel its pulsations. Supra-scapular and Transversalis Colli Ar- teries. — Both of these arteries will be observed emerging from under cover of the outer border of the sterno-mastoid. Their origin from the thyroid axis will be seen in a subsequent dissection. The supra-scapular artery proceeds outwards under shelter of the clavicle and across the third part of sub- clavian artery and the brachial nerves. At the outer limit of the supra-clavicular triangle it passes under cover of the trapezius to reach the superior border of the scapula where it has already been examined (p. 51). The transversalis colli is placed at a higher level, and is carried outwards across the posterior triangle. It passes under cover of the posterior belly of the omo- hyoid and, as a rule, superficial to the brachial nerves. 1

20 HEAD AND NECK. Superior Longitudinal Sinus.-Open into this venous channel by running the knife through its upper wall from behind forwards. It begins in front at the crista galli of the ethmoid bone and extends backwards, grooving the cranial vault in the middle line to the internal occipital protuberance-Fig. 6 (5), P- V- Here it ends in a confluence of venous sinuses termed the torcular Herofhili. Its lumen, which is triangular in form, is very small in front, but expands greatly as it is followed backwards. The mouths of the cerebral veins are observed opening into it, and, as we have , already noticed, these veins pour their blood into it ,n a direction contrary to that in which the blood flows within the channel. The veins are directed from behind forwards, whilst the blood in the sinus flows from before backwards. The channel is crossed at its inferior angle by a great number of minute bands. These receive the name of chorda Wilhsu. Falx Cerebri.-This is a sickle-shaped reduplica- tion of the supporting layer of the dura mater, which descends in the mesial plane between the two cerebral hemispheres. In order to expose it, the cerebral veins as they open into the longitudinal sinus must be divided and the hemisphere gently pulled outwards In front it is narrow and attached to the crista gafl. of the ethmoid bone. As it is followed backwards it increases in breadth, and behind it is attached in the middle line to the upper surface of the tentorium cere- belli its two lamelte separating along the line oi junction so as to form with the tentorium a sinus

322 HEAD AND NECK. It arises from the under surface of the roof of the orbit immediately in front of the optic foramen, and is inserted by a broad membranous expansion into the superior tarsal plate (p. 234). The outer and inner margins of this expansion are fixed to the rim of the orbital opening, in close proximity to the external and internal tarsal ligaments. By these attachments the action of the muscle upon the upper eyelid is in a measure limited. Dissection.â€”The frontal nerve should be divided, and the ends thrown forwards and backwards. The levator palpebral superioris may also be cut midway between its origin and insertion. On raising the posterior portion a minute nervous twig will be observed entering its deep or ocular surface. This comes from the superficial division of the third or oculo-motor nerve. The detached portion of the orbital arch may, in the next place, be removed, but the soft parts of the forehead and the upper eyelid should be retained. The eyeball should now be inflated. Gently separate the fat under cover of the superior rectus muscle and, pushing aside the ciliary nerves and vessels from the optic nerve, place a ligature around it close to the eyeball. A minute aperture should next be made in the sheath of the nerve behind the ligature, and introducing a blow-pipe into this, thrust it forcibly forwards into the interior of the eyeball. The pipe should be provided with a stylette so as to keep the aperture free. When the globe of the eye is fully inflated, the ligature may be tightened

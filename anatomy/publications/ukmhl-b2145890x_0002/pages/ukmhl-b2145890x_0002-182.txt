!64 HEAD AND NECK. Thyroid Axis.—This is a short wide trunk, which arises from the front of the subclavian close to the inner margin of the scalenus anticus, and under cover of the internal jugular vein. It lies between the phrenic and pneumogastric nerves, and almost imme- diately breaks up into its three terminal branches- viz., the inferior thyroid, the supra-scapular, and the transversalis colli. The Inferior Thyroid Artery takes a sinuous course to reach the thyroid body. At first, it ascends for a short distance upon the vertebral artery, and under cover of the internal jugular vein ; then it turns suddenly downwards and inwards, crossing behind the sympathetic and carotid sheath ; and, lastly, it bends upwards, and ends in branches which enter the inferior aspect of the thyroid body. The following branches will be noticed arising from the inferior thyroid artery :— (i.) Ascending cervical. (2.) Inferior laryngeal. (3.) Tracheal. (4.) (Esophageal (5.) Thyroid. (6.) Muscular. The ascending cervical artery is a small but very constant vessel, which runs upwards in the interval between the scalenus anticus and rectus capitis anticus major, and dispenses numerous twigs to the muscles in front of the vertebral column. These anastomose freely with corresponding branches of the vertebral artery. Other twigs from the ascending cervical, termed spinal branches, enter the spinal canal upon the spinal nerves, and have already been noticed in the dis- section of the spinal cord and its membranes (p. 95)-

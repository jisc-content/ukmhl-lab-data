DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 67 stage of the dissection it is seen ascending upon the semi-spinalis colli muscle and anastomosing with the arteria princeps cervicis. The latter artery, as we have seen, is a branch of the occipital. Both vessels like- wise anastomose with twigs from the vertebral artery. The arteria profunda cervicis is accompanied by a large vein—the vena profunda cervicis. This vessel begins in the sub-occipital region, where it is joined by the occipital veins, and it ends in the vertebral vein close to its termination. It reaches this point by turning forwards under the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra. Posterior Primary Divisions of the Spinal Nerves.—The nerves of the back must now be examined. They come from the posterior primary divisions of the spinal nerves. With four exceptions (viz., the first cervical fourth and fifth sacral, and the coccygeal nerves), each posterior division will be found to divide into an external and an internal branch. Examine these nerves successively in the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar regions. It is well, however, to defer the dissection of the sacral and coccygeal nerves until the multifidus spinae muscle has been studied. Cervical Region.—Here the posterior primary divisions of the spinal nerves are eight in number. The posterior division of the first or sub-occipital nerve, which, as we have seen, fails to divide into an external and an internal branch, lies deeply in the sub-occipital triangle, and will be examined when this space is dissected. The second nerve is very large, and appears between

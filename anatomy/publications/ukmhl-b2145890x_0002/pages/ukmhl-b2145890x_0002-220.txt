202 HEAD AND NECK. Vessels and Nerves which traverse the Parotid.-By the removal of the gland, the vessels and nerves which traverse the gland are brought into view. These are :— (i ) External carotid artery, ( Superficial temporal. dividing into . • 1 Internal maxillary. (2.) Transverse facial artery. (*.) Temporo-maxillary vein. , (4.) Facial nerve, or portio dura of the seventh cranial nerve. . (5 ) Communicating twigs from the great auricular and auriculo-temporal nerves to the portio dura. The external carotid, as it ascends in the substance of the gland, lies nearer its deep than its superficial surface. In fact, in the lower part of its parotid stage the artery is not placed within the gland, but merely under cover of it, and slightly under shelter of the posterior border of the ascending ramus of the lower jaw (Fig. 28). Note that the portio dura crosses superficial to it, and that opposite the neck of the lower jaw it divides into the superficial temporal and the internal maxillary arteries. The temporo-maxillary vein is formed by the union of the superficial temporal and internal maxillary veins behind the neck of the lower jaw. It descends in the substance of the parotid superficial to the external carotid artery. At the lower border of the gland it divides into an anterior and posterior trunk. The former joins the facial vein, whilst tlfe latter unites with the posterior auricular vein to form the external jugular.

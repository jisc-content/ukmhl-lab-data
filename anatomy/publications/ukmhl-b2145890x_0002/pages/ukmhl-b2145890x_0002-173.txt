STERNO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION. 155 acts as a cushion, and thus lessens the shock of blows received upon the shoulder; (2.) it acts as a bond of union, and prevents the clavicle from being driven upwards upon the top of the sternum when force is applied to its outer end. Synovial Membranes.—The sterno-clavicular joint is provided with two synovial membranes, placed one upon either side of the inter-articular fibro-cartilage. These are quite distinct from each other, except in cases where the fibro-cartilage is deficient in its centre. In this case the two synovial cavities communicate. A nerve-twig from the supra-sternal division of the descending superficial branches of the cervical plexus has been observed to enter the sterno-clavicular joint (Hepburn). Disarticulation of the Clavicle.—Complete the disarticulation of the clavicle by dividing the attach- ment of the fibro-cartilage to the first costal arch. By this step the meniscus is removed with the clavicle, and can therefore be more fully examined. Further, the clavicular portion of the sterno-mastoid can now be thrown forward, and the parts under cover of this muscle dissected. The sternal origin of the sterno-mastoid should not be interfered with until the subclavian and carotid vessels have been, studied. Root of the Neck. Certain structures at the root of the neck must now be displayed. These are :—

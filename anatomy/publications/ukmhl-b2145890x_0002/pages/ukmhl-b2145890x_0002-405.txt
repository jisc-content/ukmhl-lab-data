CAROTID CANAL. 387 The internal carotid artery in this part of its course is about three-fourths of an inch long. At first it ascends vertically; then, bending suddenly, it runs horizontally forwards and inwards. It emerges from the canal at the apex of the petrous bone. From this point onwards the internal carotid artery has been already examined (p. 312). Whilst within the carotid canal it lies in front of the internal ear. Ascending branch of the cervical sympathetic.—The dissector has already noted a large branch proceed- ing from the upper end of the superior cervical ganglion and entering the carotid canal with the internal carotid artery. This almost immediately divides into two parts, which place themselves one on either side of the artery, and supply branches to its coats. The further dissection of these branches is a matter of great difficulty, and can only be satis- factorily effected under specially favourable circum- stances. The external branch breaks up into the carotid plexus; the internal branch is continued into the cave?'nous plexus. From these primary offshoots secondary plexuses are prolonged upon the various branches which spring from the internal carotid artery. The carotid plexus, which lies upon the outer aspect of the internal carotid artery, gives off the following branches— (1.) one or two filaments to the sixth nerve as it turns round the internal carotid artery ; (2.) one or two twigs which join the inner part of the Gasserian ganglion ; (3.) the large deep petrosal nerve ; (4.) the small deep petrosal nerve. •The large deep petrosal nerve runs to the posterior aspect of the body of the sphenoid, and at the entrance to the Vidian

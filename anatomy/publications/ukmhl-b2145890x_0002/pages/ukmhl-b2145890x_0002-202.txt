184 HEAD AND NECK. the posterior margin of the hyo-glossus muscle, and runs inwards along the upper margin of the hyoid bone to anastomose with the corresponding vessel of the opposite side, and also with the hyoid branch of the superior thyroid. The Facial Artery can be studied, at the present stage of the dissection, from its origin up to the point where it mounts upon the base of the lower jaw to reach the face. This is termed the cervical part of the facial artery. It springs from the fore part of the external carotid, immediately above the lingual, and then proceeds upwards and forwards. Finally, it enters the region of the face at the anterior border of the masseter muscle by passing over the base of the lower jaw. In its course through the neck, it presents stages very similar to those already noticed in con- nection with the external carotid. Thus it first lies in the carotid triangle, then it disappears under cover of the posterior belly of the digastric, the stylo-hyoid muscle, and the hypo-glossal nerve; and finally it is enclosed within the substance of the submaxillary gland. With regard to this latter part of the artery, it is necessary that the dissector should note: (i.) that the vessel can be disengaged from the submaxil- lary gland by dissection without lacerating the gland- structure ; it is placed, as it were, in a deep furrow in the gland-substance; (2.) that this part of its course is almost horizontal, and parallel with the lower margin of the inferior maxilla ; (3.) that on emerging from the gland it turns abruptly upwards to reach the

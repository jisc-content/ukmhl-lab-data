HEAD AND NECK. 34o PREVERTEBRAL REGION. The following are the structures to be displayed in this dissection :— Longus colli. Cervical nerves. Rectus capitis anticus major. Vertebral artery. Rectus capitis anticus minor. Vertebral vein. Intertransverse muscles. Dissection.—In order that we may obtain a proper view of the pharynx and the prevertebral muscles, it is necessary to make a somewhat compli- cated dissection. The fore part of the skull bearing the pharynx must be separated from the back part of the skull and cervical portion of the vertebral column. Place the preparation upside down, so that the cut margin of the skull rests upon the table, and, having divided the common carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, the vagus nerve, and the sympathetic cord on each side at level of the neck of the first rib, draw the trachea and oesophagus, together with the great blood vessels and nerves, forwards from the anterior surface of the vertebral column. This separation must be effected right up to the base of the skull, but, as the posterior surface of the pharynx is merely bound to the prevertebral muscles by some loose areolar tissue, it can be very easily accomplished, and it will only be necessary to use the edge of the knife close to the skull. At this point great caution must be observed, otherwise the pharyngeal wall or the insertions of the prevertebral muscles will be

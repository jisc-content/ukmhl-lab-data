It shows the same elevations and depressions, and by its elasticity it serves to maintain the form of this structure. But it also enters into the formation of the outer portion of the external auditory meatus. By its inner margin this part of the cartilage is firmly fixed by fibrous tissue to the rough outer edge of the auditory process of the temporal bone, and it is deficient above and in front. Here the tube of the meatus is completed by tough fibrous membrane, which stretches between the tragus and the commencement of the helix. In a successful dissection of the cartilage of the pinna, two other points will attract the attention of the student. The first is a deep slit, which passes upwards so as to separate the lower part of the cartilage of the helix from the cartilage of the anti- tragus ; the second is a sharp spur of cartilage which projects forward from the helix at the level of the upper margin of the zygoma. This is termed the process of the helix, or spina helicis. The ligaments of the auricle are two in number. The anterior auricular ligament stretches from the process of the helix to the root of the zygomatic process. The posterior auricular ligament will be found under cover of the retrahens aurem. It is stronger than the preceding, and extends from a slight depression on the cranial aspect of the concha to the mastoid process. The intrinsic muscles of the pinna must be sought for

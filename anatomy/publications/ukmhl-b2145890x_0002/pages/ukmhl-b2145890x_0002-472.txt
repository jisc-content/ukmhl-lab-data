454 HEAD AND NECK. The Cricoid Cartilage is shaped like a signet ring. The broad posterior lamina is somewhat quadrilateral in form. Its superior border presents a faintly marked mesial notch, and on each side of this there is an oval convex facet which is directed outwards and upwards and articulates with the base of the' arytenoid cartilage. The posterior surface of the lamina is divided by an elevated median ridge, into two slightly hollowed out areas which give attachment to the posterior crico-arytenoid muscles. The mesial ridge itself gives origin to the fibres which form the anterior longitudinal muscular band of the oesophagus. In front of the posterior lamina, the ring of the cricoid cartilage is com- pleted by an anterior arch. The lower border of this is horizontal, and is connected to the first tracheal ring by membrane. The arch is narrow in front, and is attached to the lower border of the thyroid cartilage, by the middle portion of the crico-thyroid membrane. Behind this the upper border rapidly ascends. Upon the posterior part of the lateral surface of the cricoid cartilage, there is a circular, slightly elevated convex facet which looks outwards' and upwards for articulation with the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage. Internally the cricoid cartilage is lined by mucous membrane. Inferiorly the lumen is circular, but above it is elliptical.

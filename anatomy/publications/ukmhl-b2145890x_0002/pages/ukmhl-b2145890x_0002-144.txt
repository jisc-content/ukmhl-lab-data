126 HEAD AND NECK. which division and union of the different parts of the plexus takes place, are subject to variation * Supra-clavicular Branches of the Brachial Plexus.—The only branches of the brachial plexus which fall to the lot of the dissector of the head and neck, are those given off above the level of the clavicle. These are for the most part destined for the supply of muscles in the neighbourhood. They are :— (i.) Nerve to rhomboids, from 5th cervical nerve. (2.) Nerve to subclavius, x (3.) Supra-scapular, (from Sth and 6th cervical (4.) External respiratory j nerves. nerve of Bell, / (5.) Twigs to scalene | ^ cervical neryes muscles and V before they unite. longus colli, / (6.) Communicating twig ) ^ to phrenic nerve, J The nerve to the rhomboids is a long slender nerve which springs from the fifth cervical as it lies upon scalenus medius. Draw the fifth cervical nerve for- wards, and it will be seen passing backwards through the fibres of this muscle to reach the deep surface of * Variations in the arrangement of the different parts of the plexus are not often met with, and what at first sight very often appears to be a variation in this respect, can generally be referred with a little study to the normal type. Perhaps the most common deviation is found in the transition from the third to the fourth stage. Here occasionally we see the two inner of the anterior divisions uniting to form the inner cord, whilst the outermost anterior division is carried downwards as the outer cord. Sometimes also the inner anterior division may be observed split into two parts to give passage to the axillary artery.

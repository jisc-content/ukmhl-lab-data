HEAD AND NECK. 458 arytenoid advances towards or retreats from its fellow ; (2.) rotatory, by which the arytenoid cartilage turns round a vertical axis. By this movement the vocal process is swung outwards or inwards, so as to open or close the rima glottidis. The dissector should note that the capsule of this joint is strengthened behind by a strong band which plays a most important part in the mechanism of the articulation. It acts in such a manner that it arrests forward movement of the arytenoid cartilage. The Cuneiform Cartilages are two little conical nodules of yellow elastic cartilage, which are placed one in each arytenoid-epiglottidean fold near its back part. They are not always present. Action of the Laryngeal Muscles.â€”The dis- sector should now consider the manner in which the muscles of the larynx operate upon the true vocal cords in the production of the voice. Tension of the vocal cords is effected by the contraction of the crico- thyroid muscles. In this action the thyroid cartilage is more or less fixed. The oblique parts of the muscles raise the anterior arch of the cricoid cartilage, which causes the upper border of its posterior lamina with the arytenoid cartilages to pass backwards and down- wards. At the same time the posterior horizontal parts of the muscles tend through their insertion into the inferior cornua to draw the thyroid cartilage for- wards. When the cricothyroid muscles cease to contract, the relaxation of the cords is brought about

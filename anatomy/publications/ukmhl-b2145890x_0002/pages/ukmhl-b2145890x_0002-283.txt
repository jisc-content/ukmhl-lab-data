SUBMAXILLARY REGION. 265 between the teeth, and retained in this position by stitching it to the nose. In dissecting towards the mesial plane, three mus- cular strata are encountered—viz., the mylo-hyoid, the hyo-glossus, the genio-hyo-glossus. In the inter- vals between these, certain highly important parts will be exposed. Begin with the first muscular stratum. Mylo-hyoid.—This muscle, as we have previously seen, forms the fore part of the floor of the digastric triangle. To bring it fully into view, therefore, certain of the contents of this space must be displaced. Divide the facial artery at the point where it gains the lower jaw, and, disengaging it from the sub- maxillary gland, throw it downwards, along with its submental branch and the facial vein. Next, detach the anterior belly of the digastric from the jaw, and deal with it in the same manner. The mylo-hyoid nerve must also be cut, and the superficial part of the submaxillary gland turned backwards. The super- ficial surface of the mylo-hyoid is in this way com- pletely exposed, and its fibres should be cleaned and its attachments made out. The mylo-hyoid is a thin sheet of muscular fibres, which arises from the mylo-hyoid ridge upon the deep surface of the body of the lower jaw by an origin which extends from the last molar tooth behind to the symphysis in front. Its fibres are directed down- wards, inwards, and backwards, and present two different modes of insertion. The posterior fibres are

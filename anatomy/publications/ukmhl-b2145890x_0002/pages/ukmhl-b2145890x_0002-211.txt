DISSECTION OF THE FACE. 193 External Anatomy of the Ocular Appendages. —Before the skin is reflected from the face, the external appearance of the various appendages of the eye should be studied. Under this head we examine :— 1. The eyebrows. 2. The eyelids. 3. The conjunctiva. The eyebrows are two curved tegumentary pro- jections placed over the orbital arch of the frontal bone, so as to intervene between the forehead above and the ocular regions below. The short stiff hairs which spring from these have an outward inclination Whilst this is the general arrangement, however, it will be easily seen that the lower hairs at the same time incline upwards and the upper hairs incline downwards. The tegumentary thickening which gives rise to the prominence of the eyebrows will afterwards be seen to be caused partly by an increased density of the skin, and partly by subjacent muscular fibres Three muscles gain partial insertion into it-viz., the orbi- cularis palpebrarum, the corrugator supercilii, and the frontal belly of the occipito-frontalis. The eyelids are two semilunar curtains provided for the protection of each eyeball. The upper id is the longer and much the more movable of he two. When the eye is open the margins of the two lids are slightly concave and the interval between them is elliptical in outline. This interval is termed the .palpebral fissure. When the eye is PART III.

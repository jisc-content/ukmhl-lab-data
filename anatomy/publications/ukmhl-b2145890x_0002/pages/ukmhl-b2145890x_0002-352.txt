334 HEAD AND NECK. into the sclerotic, about a quarter of an inch behind the sclero-corneal junction. The Third Nerve.—The two divisions of this nerve enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, between the two heads of the external rectus. The superior division has been traced to the rectus superior and the levator palpebral superioris. The inferior division is much the larger of the two, and almost immediately divides into three branches for the supply of the rectus internus, the rectus inferior, and the inferior oblique. The nerves to the two recti enter the ocular surfaces of these muscles ; the nerve to the inferior oblique is a long branch, which is prolonged forwards in the interval, between the rectus inferior and rectus externus, and enters the hinder border of the inferior oblique. Soon after its origin this branch gives the short motor root to the lenticular ganglion, and it likewise supplies two or three additional fila- ments to the inferior rectus. The Sixth Nerve will be found closely applied to the ocular surface of the external rectus, and it enters the orbit by passing through the narrow interval between the heads of this muscle. It is destined entirely for the supply of the rectus externus. Arrangement of the Nerves in the Sphenoidal Fissure.—Now that the orbit is dissected, and the various nerves which were met in the dissection of the

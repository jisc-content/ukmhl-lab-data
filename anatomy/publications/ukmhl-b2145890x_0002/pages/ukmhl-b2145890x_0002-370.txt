352 HEAD AND NECK. a distinct capsular ligament. This ligament is more laxly arranged in the neck than in the lower regions of the spine. The ligamenta subflava may be examined on the laminse which were removed for the display of the spinal cord, and which the dissector was directed to retain. In this specimen they may be studied in the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar regions of the spine. They fill up the gaps between the laminae of the vertebrae, and can be best seen when the fore aspect of the specimen is viewed. They are composed of yellow elastic tissue, and each ligament is attached superiorly to the anterior surface and inferior margin of the lamina of the vertebra above, whilst inferiorly it is fixed to the posterior surface and superior margin of the lamina of the vertebra next below. In this way they form with the laminae a smooth, even, posterior wall for the spinal canal. Each ligament extends from the posterior part of the articular processes to the mesial plane where it is in contact by a free thickened inner border with its neighbour of the opposite side. The mesial slit between them in each interneural space is filled by some lax connective tissue, and it allows the egress from the spinal canal of some small veins. The width of the ligaments in the different regions of the spine depends upon the size of the spinal canal. Thus they are widest in the neck and in the lumbar part of the column. The ligamenta subflava, by virtue of their great strength and elasticity, are powerful agents in maintaining the curvatures of the spine ; they are also a valuable aid to the muscles in restoring the

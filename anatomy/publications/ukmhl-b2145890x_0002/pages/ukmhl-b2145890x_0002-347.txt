THE OPHTHALMIC ARTERY. 329 The short ciliary nerves are from six to ten in number, and they come off in two groups, of which one emerges from the upper and fore angle of the ganglion, whilst the other springs from its lower and fore angle. ' The lower group is generally more numerous than the upper. As these fine nerves proceed along the optic nerve they divide, and thus increase in number; at the back of the eye-ball from twelve to eighteen may be counted. Finally they pierce the sclerotic by a series of apertures which are placed around the entrance of the optic nerve. The Ophthalmic Artery is a branch of the internal carotid, and it accompanies the optic nerve into the orbit through the optic foramen (pp. 30 and 38). At first it lies to the outer side of the optic nerve, but it soon inclines inwards, and crossing the nerve, proceeds forwards along the inner wall of the orbit, under cover of the superior oblique muscle. At the inner angle of the orbit, it ends by dividing into two terminal branches—viz., the frontal and the nasal. The branches of the ophthalmic artery are very numerous, and they can seldom be satisfactorily displayed, unless a special injection has been made, or a cold injection used. They are :— (1.) The lachrymal. (6.) Ethmoidal. (2.) Muscular. (7.) Palpebral. (3.) Arteria retinae centralis. (8.) Nasal. (4.) Ciliary. • (9.) Frontal. (5.) Supra-orbital.

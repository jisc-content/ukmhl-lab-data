HEAD AND NECK. 250 The second part extends obliquely upwards and for- wards upon the surface of the external pterygoid muscle, and under cover of the insertion of the temporal muscle into the coronoid process of the lower jaw. The third part dips between the two heads of the external pterygoid, and is contained in the spheno-maxillary fossa. Whilst this is the most frequent arrangement it is by no means uncommon to find the second part of the artery, lying in a deeper plane—viz., between the internal and external pterygoid muscles. In this case the vessel always takes a turn outwards between the heads of the external pterygoid muscle, and appears on its surface before entering the spheno-maxillary fossa. The branches of the internal maxillary artery are classified into three groups according to the portion of the vessel from which they spring. One branch only of the third part—viz., the posterior dental artery, can be studied in this dissection. Those arising from the first and second parts are :—; From the First Part.

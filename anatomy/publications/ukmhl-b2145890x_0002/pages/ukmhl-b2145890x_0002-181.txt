163 ROOT OF THE NECK. size will be observed springing from the third part of the subclavian artery. This, in all probability, will be the posterior scapular arising directly from the sub- clavian. It is so common an occurrence, that the dissector must always be prepared to meet it. Vertebral Arteryâ€”This is the first branch which is given off by the subclavian. It springs from the upper and back part of the trunk about three-quarters of an inch from its commencement on the right side, and from the point where the vessel reaches the root of the neck on the left side. Only a small portion of its extent is seen in the present dissection. It pro- ceeds upwards in the interval between the longus colli and the scalenus anticus, and disappears by entering the vertebra-arterial foramen of the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra. It is placed very deeply. It is covered in front by its companion vein and the internal jugular vein, and is crossed by the inferior thyroid artery. Numerous large sympathetic twigs accompany it. In this respect, indeed, it is more richly endowed than any of the other subclavian branches. The vertebral artery on the left side has an addi- tional relation. It is crossed by the thoracic duct. The vertebral vein will be noticed issuing from the aperture in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, and passing downwards in front of its companion artery, and behind the internal jugular vein, to open into the posterior aspect of the com- mencement of the innominate vein. Near its termina- tion it crosses the subclavian artery. It receives the deep cervical and the ascending cervical veins.

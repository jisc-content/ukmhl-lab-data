Interior of the Pharynx.—The pharynx should now be opened by a vertical and mesial incision through the entire length of the posterior wall. At the upper extremity of this cut, the knife should be carried transversely outwards, close to the basis cranii, so as to divide the attachment of the posterior wall to the basi-occipital bone. The stuffing should be removed, and the mucous surface of the pharynx cleansed. The roof of the pharynx will be seen to be formed by the basilar process of the occipital bone, covered by a dense periosteum, and a thick coating of mucous membrane. It is important to note that the posterior wall and the roof of the pharynx can be explored by the finger introduced through the mouth. The mucous membrane, or innermost stratum which enters into the construction of the pharyngeal wall, is now exposed, and the dissector will note that it is continuous through the various apertures with the mucous membrane of the nasal fossae, of the Eustach- ian tubes, of the buccal cavity, of the larynx, and of the oesophagus. The glands in connection with the mucous mem- brane of the pharynx are of two kinds—viz., racemose and follicular. The racemose glands will be noticed to form a thick layer on the lateral and posterior aspects of the upper part of the pharyngeal wall. They gradually diminish in number as they are

NASAL GROUP OF MUSCLES. 213 attached to the pterygo-maxillary ligament, which acts as the bond of union between it and the superior constrictor muscle of the pharynx. This attachment cannot be studied at present, but will be afterwards examined in the dissection of the pharyngeal wall. Anteriorly it abuts against the angle of the mouth, and its fibres blend with the facial part of the orbicularis oris, a large part of which it forms. But the manner in which the fibres of this muscle enter the orbicularis must be examined. The upper and lower fibres pass directly into the corresponding lip ; Fig. 30. the middle fibres decussate at the angle of the mouth, so that the lower fibres of this series enter the upper lip, whilst the higher fasciculi reach the lower lip. Nasal Group of Muscles.—Under this head are comprised:— 1. Compressor naris. 3. Pyramidalis nasi. 2. Levator labii superioris 4. Depressor alse nasi. alseque nasi (already 5. Dilatator naris posterior, examined). 6. Dilatator naris anterior. The Compressor Naris is a flat triangular muscle which springs by a pointed fleshy origin from the

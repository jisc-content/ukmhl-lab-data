149 HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE. more vertical direction. The intermediate tendon is bound down to the great cornu and the body of the hyoid bone by a strong aponeurotic band. The stylo-hyoid muscle is placed along the upper border of the posterior belly of the digastric. It is a small muscular band which arises from the styloid process of the temporal bone not far from its base. It is generally inserted by means of two slips into the hyoid bone at the point where the great cornu joins the body. The intermediate tendon of the digastric passes forwards between the two slips of insertion of the stylo-hyoid. Hypoglossal Nerve.—The portion of this nerve which traverses the anterior triangle can be studied at this stage. It appears by emerging from under cover of the posterior belly of the digastric, and immediately turns forwards by hooking round the occipital artery. Near the upper border of the hyoid bone it disappears from the present dissection by passing under cover of the mylo'-hyoid muscle. But what are its relations in this part of its course ? As it runs forwards it crosses the external carotid and lingual arteries, and before passing from view under the mylo-hyoid it lies upon the hyoglossus ; observe, further, that it is crossed by the intermediate tendon of the digastric and the two slips of insertion of the stylo-hyoid. Two branches will be seen to arise from it in the anterior triangle, viz.:— (1.) The descendens noni. (2.) The thyro-hyoid.

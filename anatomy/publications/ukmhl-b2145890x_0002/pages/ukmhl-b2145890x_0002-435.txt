SPHENO-PALATINE GANGLION. 417 bone. As the dissection is being made from the inside, the small, or posterior palatine nerve, will be first encountered, and it will be seen to pass back- wards into the soft palate, under cover of the tendin- ous expansion of the tensor palati.* This must be divided, in order that the small palatine nerve may be followed to its distribution. It is the nerve of supply to the levator palati, and the azygos uvulae. The external palatine nerve will be found issuing from its canal a short distance to the outer side of the pre- ceding nerve. It is distributed to the soft palate in the neighbourhood of the tonsil. It is smaller than the posterior palatine nerve, and is sometimes absent. The great or anterior palatine nerve should now be followed onwards to the hard palate. To do this the lower part of the posterior palatine canal must be opened up by removing a small portion of the posterior and outer part of the horizontal plate of the palate bone. The nerve as it emerges from the posterior palatine foramen turns forwards, and divides into branches, which lie in grooves on the under aspect of the hard palate. It supplies the gum, the mucous membrane, and glands of the vault of the mouth, and in the neighbourhood of the anterior palatine foramen it effects a communication with the naso-palatine nerve. During its passage through the posterior palatine canal this nerve has already been observed to supply two inferior nasal branches (p. 412). * The present is a good opportunity to observe the corru- gated or wrinkled appearance of the tendon of the tensor palati, as it passes under the hamular process. part in. 2 E

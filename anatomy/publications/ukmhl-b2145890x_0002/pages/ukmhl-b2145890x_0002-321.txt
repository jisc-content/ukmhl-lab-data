FIRST LOOP OF THE CERVICAL PLEXUS. 3°3 division of the first cervical nerve will be seen emerging from under cover of its inner margin. The rectus lateralis arises from the forepart of the upper surface of the extremity of the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the under surface of the jugular eminence of the occipital bone. It is supplied by a branch from the anterior division of the first cervical nerve. First Loop of the Cervical Plexus. —The anterior primary division of the first cervical or suboccipital nerve may next be examined. It will be noticed emerging from under cover of the inner surface of the rectus lateralis muscle. It at once turns downwards in front of the transverse process of the atlas, and joining the ascending branch of the second cervical nerve, forms the first loop of the cervical plexus. From this loop branches are given to two muscles—viz., the rectus capitis anticus major and minor; it is likewise brought into connection by means of communicating twigs with—(i.) the superior cervical ganglion ; (2.) the vagus ; (3.) the hypoglossal. If the rectus lateralis muscle be detached from the transverse process of the atlas and turned upwards, a twig from the anterior division of the first cervical nerve will be found entering its deep surface ; further by cutting through the origin of the superior oblique muscle of the head, this nerve-division may be traced to the upper surface of the neural arch of the atlas, where it takes origin from the first spinal nerve trunk. The entire length of the anterior primary division

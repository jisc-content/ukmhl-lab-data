INFERIOR PALATINE. 283 the base of the skull, where it ends by dividing into minute meningeal twigs. Its relations are very simple. It is placed between the internal carotid artery and the wall of the pharynx, and this position it holds throughout its entire course. The following branches will be recognised as springing from the ascending pharyngeal :— (1.) Pharyngeal. (2.) Prevertebral. (3.) Meningeal. The pharyngeal branches supply the pharynx, and the lower members of the series anastomose with the superior thyroid artery. Higher up, a larger palatine branch distributes twigs to the Eustachian tube, the soft palate, and the tonsil. The prevertebral branches are small twigs which are given to the prevertebral muscles, and anastomose with the ascending cervical artery. The meningeal twigs enter the cranium through three openings—viz., the foramen lacerum medium, the jugular foramen, and the anterior condyloid foramen (p. 39). Inferior Palatine and Tonsillitic Arteries.—At this stage the dissector should again examine these vessels—the first branches which are given off by the facial artery. They have already been described in p. 185, but their relations as they ascend in the neck can now be more satisfactorily studied. The size of the inferior palatine is very variable, and

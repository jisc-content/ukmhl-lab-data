349 VERTEBRAL JOINTS. neighbourhood. The lateral spinal branches enter the spinal canal upon the cervical nerves, and have been described on p. 81. The Vertebral Vein does not take origin within the cranium. It merely accompanies the artery in the cervical part of its course. Its radicles arise in the suboccipital region, where they anastomose with the tributaries of the occipital and deep cervical veins. Inferiorly the vertebral vein opens into the innominate vein (p. 163). VERTEBRAL AND CRANIO-VERTEBRAL ARTICULATIONS. The muscles must now be completely removed in order that the vertebral and cranio-vertebral joints, and the ligaments in connection with the cervical portion of the spine may be examined. The axis, atlas, and occipital bone present a series of articula- tions in which the uniting apparatus is very different from that of the vertebrae below. The lower five Cervical Vertebrae are united together very much upon the same plan as the vertebrae in other regions of the vertebral column. Both bodies and neural arches are connected by distinct articulations and special ligaments. Bodies.â€”Three separate joints may be said to exist between the opposed surfaces of the bodies of two

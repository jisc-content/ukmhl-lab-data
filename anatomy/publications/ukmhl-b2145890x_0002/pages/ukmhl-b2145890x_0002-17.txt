3 SCALP. This, however, is no easy matter, owing to the very firm connection which exists between them. The roots of the hair which pierce the integument obliquely, and are imbedded in the superficial fascia, are neces- sarily divided. Superficial Fascia.—On the summit of the cranium this, although thin, is exceedingly dense and tough, owing to strong septa of fibrous tissue which bind it on the one hand to the integument, and on the other to the subjacent epicranial aponeurosis. The meshes formed by these fibrous partitions are filled with small lobules of fat, which give it a granular appearance. As this fascia is traced forwards towards the forehead, and downwards on each side towards the ears, it loses in great part its dense fibrous character, and becomes looser and less fatty. It is in this stratum that the cutaneous vessels and nerves ramify before they enter the skin. Occipito-frontalis Muscle and Epicranial Aponeurosis.—The superficial fascia may now be removed from the surface of the occipito-frontalis. In doing this, the dissector must proceed very cautiously, so as not to injure the cutaneous nerves and blood-vessels which ramify in its midst. The occipito-frontalis is a quadricipital muscle- possessing two occipital and two frontal bellies. The occipital bellies—-Fig. I (2)—are quite distinct from each other, being separated by a marked interval. Each arises from the outer two-thirds of the superior curved line of the occipital bone, and from a small portion of

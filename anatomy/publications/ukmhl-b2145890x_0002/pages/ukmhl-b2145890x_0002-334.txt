HEAD AND NECK. 3i6 to the inner side of the supraorbital notch. By this proceeding the portion of the orbital arch which bears the pulley for the tendon of the superior oblique muscle lies to the inner side of the saw- cut, and is thus retained in place during the subsequent dissection. (2.) The second section must be made very obliquely. Apply the saw to the cut margin of the skull, on a line with the posterior border of the great wing of the sphenoid, and carry it downwards and inwards to the outer extremity of the orbital arch* so as to open at the same time into the outer extremity of the sphenoidal fissure. The inner saw-cut should now be prolonged backwards, by means of the chisel, to a point a short distance in front of the optic foramen, and then carried outwards to the point at which the external saw-cut has opened into the sphenoidal fissure. When this is done, a sharp tap with a wooden mallet will disengage the piece of bone, and tilt it forwards. It must not be removed until the frontal nerve has been dissected, but the thin portion of the orbital roof which projects from its posterior aspect may be taken away by the bone-pliers. The inner portion of the orbital roof, as well as the lesser wing of the sphenoid where it forms * The usual section which is recommended is a vertical cut through the outer end of the orbital arch, but much more space for dissection will be gained by adopting the section as described. It was Dr. Thornley Stoker, of the Royal College of Surgeons, who fifst pointed this out to the author.

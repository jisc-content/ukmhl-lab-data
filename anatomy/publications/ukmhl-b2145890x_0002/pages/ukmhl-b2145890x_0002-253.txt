LACHRYMAL APPARATUS. 235 The nerves are more numerous, and come from a number of different sources. The motor filaments for the palpebral part of the orbicularis are derived from the facial nerve, and enter the lids at the outer margin of the orbit. The sensory twigs for the upper lid come from the lachrymal, supra-orbital, supra- trochlear, and infra-trfichlear nerves, whilst the lower lid is supplied by branches from the infra-orbital nerve. Lachrymal Apparatus.—The following structures are included under this heading :— 1. The lachrymal gland and its ducts. 2. The lachrymal canals. 3. The lachrymal sac and the nasal duct. 4. The tensor tarsi muscle. The lachrymal gland lies within the orbit, in the hollow which marks the roof of this cavity, upon the inner side of the external angular process of the frontal bone. The fore part of the gland, however, projects slightly beyond the orbital margin, and can be exposed at the outer side of the tendon of the levator palpebrae superioris, where it rests upon the conjunctiva of the upper eyelid, as it is reflected from the lid on to the eyeball. If the gland be now raised gently and the point of the knife carried carefully up and down through the connective tissue under it, numerous exceedingly delicate ducts, like fine threads will be seen proceed- ing from it. These are twelve or fourteen in number, and they open in a row upon the under surface of the conjunctiva of the upper lid, along the line of the

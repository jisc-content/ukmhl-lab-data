BLOOD-SINUSES. 33 superior longitudinal sinus is termed the torcular Herophili, and it communicates by means of a trans- verse channel, which crosses the front of the internal occipital protuberance, with the commencement of the lateral sinus of the opposite side. Inferior Longitudinal Sinus—Fig. 8 (Ssi).—Xhis small sinus runs backwards in the lower free border of the falx cerebri. It begins at a variable point behind the crista galli, and ends posteriorly, and in the mesial plane, at the anterior free edge of the tentorium, where it pours its blood into the straight sinus. The Straight Sinus extends backwards and downwards in the mesial plane, from the anterior free edge of the tentorium to the internal occipital protub- erance. Its course corresponds with the attachment of the posterior broad end of the falx cerebri to the upper surface of the tentorium. Indeed, it is formed by the opening out of the two layers of the falx on the upper surface of the tentorium. At its anterior extremity it receives the blood from the inferior longitudinal sinus and the veins of Galen. The latter return the blood from the interior of the brain, and their ruptured ends may be noticed as they enter the straight sinus. At the internal occipital protuberance, the straight sinus bends suddenly outwards, in a direction opposite to that taken by the superior longitudinal sinus, and it forms the lateral sinus of that side. In its course backwards, a few small cerebellar veins pour their blood into the straight sinus. PART III D

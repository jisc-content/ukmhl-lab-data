ORAL GROUP OF MUSCLES. 211 infra-orbital foramen. It takes the form of a flat band which proceeds downwards and slightly in- wards, and it ends by some of its fasciculi running into the orbicularis, while others gain a direct insertion into the skin of the lip. Under cover of this muscle the large infra-orbital nerve emerges on the face and joins with branches of the facial nerve in the infra- orbital plexus. The Zygomaticus Minor may almost be looked upon as a part of the preceding muscle. It is also closely connected with the orbicularis palpebrarum, from which some of its fasciculi are often derived, and it lies on the same plane as those slender slips which the orbicularis oris sends downwards from its lower margin to the skin of the cheek. It is a slender fleshy bundle which arises from the anterior and lower part of the zygomatic arch in front of the zygomaticus major, and passes downwards and forwards to join the outer margin of the levator labii superioris. Levator anguli oris (musculus caninus).â€”The origin of this muscle is hidden by the levator labii superioris. It springs from the upper part of the canine fossa immediately below the infra-orbital foramen, and proceeds downwards and outwards to the angle of the mouth. Here its fasciculi mingle with those of the orbicularis, zygomaticus major and depressor anguli oris.

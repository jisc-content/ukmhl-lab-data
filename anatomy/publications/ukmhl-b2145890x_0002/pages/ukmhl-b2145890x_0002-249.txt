231 EYELIDS. already been examined, and the skin has been reflected. The palpebral part of the orbicularis muscle in each lid forms a thin layer of arching muscular fibres loosely connected with the integument by some lax areolar tissue. A fasciculus, somewhat thicker than the others, lies along the free margin of each lid, close to the bases of the eyelashes. This is termed the muscuhis ciliaris. The entire orbicularis muscle may now be thrown inwards. This will show very clearly the origin of its muscular fibres at the inner margin of the orbit (p. 205). In raising the palpebral part great care must be taken to preserve the palpebral vessels and nerves, and at the same time to avoid injury to the palpebral ligament. The Tarsi and the Palpebral Ligaments.â€”The removal of the palpebral part of the orbicularis brings into view the palpebral ligaments and the tarsi. These lie in the same morphological plane, and they constitute the groundwork of the eyelids. The tarsi are two thin plates of condensed con- nective tissue placed one in each eyelid, so as to occupy an area immediately adjoining its free margin. They differ very materially from each other. The superior tarsal plate is much the larger of the two, and presents the figure of a half oval. Its deep surface is intimately connected with the subjacent conjunctiva, whilst its superficial surface is clothed by the orbicularis, and is in relation to the roots of the eyelashes. Its superior border is thin,

DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 49 enters the space when the sterno-mastoid and trapezius do not meet to form a distinct apex for the triangle —viz., the occipital artery. In such a case a small portion of the vessel will be noticed upon the complexus. s The Spinal Accessory Nerve appears in the posterior triangle by emerging from the substance of the sterno-mastoid muscle. It crosses the triangle obliquely, running from above downwards and back- wards, and finally disappears under the anterior border of the trapezius. The Cervical Branches to the Trapezius, two or three in number, spring from the third and fourth cervical nerves. They enter the posterior triangle by leaving the shelter of the sterno-mastoid, and are earned downwards and backwards across the space parallel with, but at a lower level than the spinal accessory nerve. This, together with the fact that they are somewhat smaller than the spinal accessory ^ sufficient to distinguish between these nerves, they finally disappear under the anterior border of the trapezius.

THE NASAL CARTILAGES. 239 The lachrymal sac, therefore, lies between the tendo oculi and the tensor tarsi, and although anatomists are not quite agreed as to the exact mode of action of this muscle, there can be little doubt that it must be looked upon as a dependency of the lachrymal apparatus. By its contraction it either aids the propulsion of the fluid through the lachrymal sac or it places the puncta in a more favourable position for the entrance of the tears. The Nasal Cartilages.â€”The cartilaginous part of the nose should now be examined by stripping off the compressor naris muscle and the remains of the integument. In addition to the septal cartilage which will be more appropriately studied in the dissection of the nasal cavity, two cartilaginous plates will be found upon each side. These are : 1. The upper lateral cartilage. 2. The cartilage of the aperture. The tipper lateral cartilage is a triangular plate which by its posterior margin is attached to the lower border of the nasal bone and -the upper part of the sharp margin of the nasal notch of the superior maxillary bone. Its anterior edge is in contact above with the corresponding part of its fellow of the oppo- site side, but below there is a slight interval between them in which is seen the margin of the nasal septal cartilage. The inferior border of the lateral cartilage is connected with the outer part of the cartilage of the aperture by some dense fibrous tissue.

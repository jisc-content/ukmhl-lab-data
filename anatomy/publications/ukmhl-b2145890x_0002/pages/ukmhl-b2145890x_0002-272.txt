254 HEAD AND NECK. sphenoid, and is attached below to the sharp project- ing inner margin of the inferior dental foramen. It is not in direct relationship with the joint. Above, it lies under cover of the external pterygoid muscle ; lower down, the internal maxillary artery intervenes between it and the neck of the lower jaw; whilst, still lower, the inferior dental vessels and nerve are interposed between it and the ramus of the jaw. The stylo-maxillary ligament has already been noticed. It is an aponeurotic band, derived from the deep cervical fascia, which is attached on the one hand to the styloid process, and on the other to the angle and posterior border of the ramus of the jaw, between the internal pterygoid and masseter muscles. An examination of these ligaments will at once show that very little is added to the strength of the joint by their presence. The security of the joint depends, therefore, not so much upon its ligaments as upon the strong muscles of mastication, which keep the head of the lower jaw in its place. The inter-articular fibro-cartilage is an oval plate, with its long axis directed transversely. It is inter- posed between the condyle of the lower jaw and the glenoid cavity in such a manner as to divide the joint cavity into an upper and lower portion, each of which is provided with a separate synovial membrane. To expose the cartilage, the external lateral ligament must be removed. It will then be seen to be adapted to the two bony surfaces between which it lies. Above, it is concavo-convex, in correspondence with the em'inentia articularis and the glenoid fossa ; whilst,

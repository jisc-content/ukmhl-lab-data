4 HEAD AND NECK. ' the adjoining part of the mastoid process of the temporal bone immediately above the insertion of the sterno-mastoid. From this the fibres ascend in the form of a thin fleshy layer of about two inches in length, and are inserted into the epicranial aponeurosis. The' frontal bellies are composed of exceedingly pale fibres, and are not perfectly distinct from each other ; for a short distance above the root of the nose their inner margins are blended along the middle line. Above this, however, they diverge slightly, and are separated by a narrow interval. They possess little or no direct attachment to bone. It is true that a few of the fibres of each belly may be seen to arise from the internal angular process of the frontal bone, but by far the greater number of the fibres mingle with those of the orbicularis palpebrarum and the corrugator supercilii, whilst a few of the innermost fibres proceed downwards upon the nasal bone to form the pyramid- alis nasi muscle. Ascending upon the forehead, the frontal bellies are inserted near the line of the coronal suture into the epicranial aponeurosis. The epicranial aponeurosis, which connects the occi- pital and frontal bellies of the occipo-frontalis muscle, constitutes a continuous layer over the summit and sides of the head. Posteriorly it can be traced backwards in the interval between the two occipital bellies of the muscle, when it will be observed to have an attach- ment to the external occipital protuberance and the superior curved line of the occipital bone. Laterally, it presents no sharply defined margin, but, losing its aponeurotic character, is prolonged downwards as

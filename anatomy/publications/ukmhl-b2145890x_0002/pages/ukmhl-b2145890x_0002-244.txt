226 HEAD AND NECK. Facial Vein.—The facial vein begins at the inner canthus of the eye, in a well marked venous radicle called the angular vein, which is formed by tribu- taries coming from the forehead, the upper eyelid and the root of the nose (p. II). The course which the facial vein takes is not nearly so tortuous as that of the corresponding artery; it lies behind the artery and is separated from it by a considerable interval. At the base of the lower jaw the two vessels come together. Numerous tributaries join the facial vein as it courses through the face and a large branch called the deep facial connects it with the pterygoid plexus of veins. The Auricle or Pinna.—Before dissecting the auricle, it is well to learn the names of its various parts, and note the position which they hold m relation to each other. The concha is the wide and deep fossa which leads into the external meatus; the anti-helix is the prominence which bounds this posteriorly ; the helix is the folded or incurved margin of the pinna; and the lobule is its soft dependent part. A small prominence in front of the meatus, and projecting backwards so as to overshadow it, is termed the tragus, whilst a similar eminence behind and below the meatus receives the name of the anti-tragus. But it will be noted that the upper end of the anti-helix bifurcates, and in this way two fossae are marked off from each other; one—the fossa of the helix, or scaphoid fossa,-is placed behind the anti-helix, and

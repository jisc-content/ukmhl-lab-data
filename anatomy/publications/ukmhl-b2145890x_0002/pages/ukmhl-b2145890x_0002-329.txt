THE THIRD, FOURTH, AND SIXTH NERVES. 311 The Third, Fourth, and Sixth Nerves.â€”The third and fourth nerves, as the dissector has previously noted, pierce the dura mater within the small trian- gular area, which is formed by the divergence of the attached and free margins of the tentorium. They now proceed forwards in the outer wall of the caver- nous sinus. The third nerve occupies the highest level, then comes the fourth nerve, and immediately below this is the ophthalmic division of the fifth. They therefore present a numerical order from above downwards. The sixth nerve, which pierces the dura mater at the lower and outer part of the dorsum sellae, will be observed to wind round the outer side of the internal carotid artery, and then to proceed forwards on the floor of the cavernous sinus. It therefore occupies a lower level than the three nerves in the outer wall of the sinus, and at first lies some- what apart from them. The third, fourth, and sixth nerves give off no branches during their course through the cavernous sinus, but each receives a minute twig from the ophthalmic division of the fifth, and also one or more filaments from the sympathetic. They all enter the orbit by passing through the sphenoidal fissure; before doing so, the third nerve divides into an upper and a lower division. During their passage through the fissure the various nerves undergo a change in their relative positions. This, however, will be studied in the dissection of the orbit when the sphenoidal fissure is opened up.

227 THE AURICLE OR PINNA. the other—the fossa of the anti-helix, or triangular fossa,—is situated between the two diverging and terminal limbs of the anti-helix. The pinna may now be dissected. It consists of a thin plate of yellow fibro-cartilage, covered by integu- ment. It is fixed in position by certain ligaments, and possesses two sets of feeble muscles—viz., one group termed extrinsic, passing to the cartilage from the aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis and the mastoid process, and a second group, in con- nection with the cartilage alone, and therefore called intrinsic.

DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 59 tion is rendered all the more distinct from the external branches of the posterior primary divisions of the dorsal spinal nerves appearing in the interval. Turn the muscle outwards with the handle of the knife, and clean its slips of insertion. The nerves must, at the same time, be carefully preserved. The sacro-lumbalis will now be observed to end in six or seven tendinous slips, which are inserted into the angles of the six or seven lower ribs. But wher- ever the sacro-lumbalis drops one of these slips, another tendinous slip takes origin from the upper border of the same rib. In this way a second muscle is formed, which continues the outer column of the erector spinse upwards. This muscle is called the musculus accessorius. The Musculus Accessorius, therefore, arises close to the inner side of the sacro-lumbalis by six tendinous slips from the upper borders of the six lower ribs. It terminates in tendons which are inserted into the angles of the upper six ribs, and also into the transverse process of the lowest cervical vertebra. Cervicalis Ascendens.â€” This muscle may be looked upon as the continuation of the outer column upwards into the neck. It arises close to the inner side of the accessorius by four slips from the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs, and is inserted into trans- verse processes of the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae.

388 HEAD AND NECK. canal it joins the great superficial petrosal nerve and forms the Vidian nerve (p. 314). The small deep petrosal nerve connects the carotid plexus with the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal as it traverses the tympanum (p. 291, and Fig. 34). The cavernous plexus has already been sufficiently described on p. 313. Dissection to expose the Superior Maxillary Nerveâ€”As the superior maxillary nerve proceeds forwards to reach the face it traverses the upper part of the sphenomaxillary fossa and the infra-orbital canal. The dissector should therefore proceed to expose the nerve in these localities. Remove the temporal muscle and the upper head of the external pterygoid, and, placing the saw upon the cut margin of the skull at a point immediately above the external auditory meatus, carry it obliquely downwards and forwards through the squamous part of the temporal bone and the great wing of the sphenoid to the inner end of the sphenoidal fissure. This saw-cut should enter the sphenoidal fissure immediately to the outer side of the foramen rotundum. If the previous dissection of the orbit has been carried out as directed, the piece of bone above the incision which has just been made should be loose, and can therefore be removed. Additional space may be obtained and the sphenomaxillary fossa more fully opened up by removing what remains of the great wing of the sphenoid upon the outer side of the foramen rotundum, but the circumference of this aperture must be carefully preserved. Proceed, in the next place,

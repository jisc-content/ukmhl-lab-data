SCALP. . 11 nerve. The veins corresponding to these arteries unite at the inner margin of the orbit to form the angular vein, which afterwards becomes the facial vein. The superficial temporal artery will be noticed ascending upon the temporal fascia, immediately in front of the ear. Two inches above the zygoma it divides into its two terminal branches â€” viz., the anterior and posterior superficial temporal arteries. The anterior superficial temporal artery takes a tortuous course upwards and forwards to the fore- head, and supplies numerous brandies to the integument, muscles, and pericranium. Further, it anastomoses with the frontal and supra - orbital arteries, and with the corresponding vessel of the opposite side. The posterior superficial temporal artery inclines upwards and backwards, arching over the cranium above the auricle. It gives off numerous twigs to the parts in this region, and communicates with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the posterior auricular and occipital arteries. The posterior auricular artery ascends in the angle between the cartilage of the ear and the mastoid pro- cess, and ends by dividing into two branches, of which one turns forwards to supply the retrahens aurem and the cranial surface of the pinna, whilst the other inclines backwards towards the occiput, where it communicates with the occipital artery. The posterior auricular vein 'is a comparatively large vessel. It

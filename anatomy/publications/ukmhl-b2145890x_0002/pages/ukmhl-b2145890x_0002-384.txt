HEAD AND NECK. 366 eurosis is a dense fascia which covers the buccinator muscle. Above and below it is attached to the alveolar portions of the maxillary bones, whilst behind it is continued backwards upon the side of the pharynx. The muscles which traverse the fatty layer are chiefly the zygomaticus major, the risorius, and the posterior fibres of the platysma. The parotid duct pierces the three inner layers of the cheek, and opens into the mouth opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw. Gums and Teeth.—The mucous membrane of the gums is smooth, vascular, and firmly bound down to the subjacent periosteum of the alveolar portions of the jaws by a stratum of dense connective tissue. It is continuous on the one hand with the mucous membrane of the lips and cheeks, and on the other, with the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. The gum embraces closely the neck of each tooth. In the adult the teeth in each jaw number sixteen. From the middle line backwards, on each side, they are the two incisors, the canine, the two bicuspids, the three molars. Floor of the Mouth.—The mucous membrane is reflected from the inner aspect of the lower jaw, on to the side of the tongue, but in the fore part of the mouth the tongue lies free in the buccal cavity. Here the mucous membrane stretches across the floor from one side of the lower jaw to the other.

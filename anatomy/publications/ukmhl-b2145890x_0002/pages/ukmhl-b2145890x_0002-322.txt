304 HEAD AND NECK. of the first cervical nerve may now be studied, and its relations are simply these—it turns round the superior articular process of the atlas, under cover of the vertebral artery and the rectus capitis lateralis, and gaining the anterior aspect of the atlas, it enters into the formation of the first loop of the cervical plexus. As it lies in relation to the vertebral artery it is joined by a filament from the sympathetic plexus which surrounds that vessel. Removal of the Head and Neck from the Trunk.—By the time that the dissectors of the head and neck have arrived at this stage of their work, the dissectors of the thorax have in all probability finished their dissection. If this be the case, the head and neck may be removed from the trunk by cutting through the vertebral column at the level of the intervertebral disc between the third and fourth dorsal vertebrae. By this proceeding the three upper dorsal vertebrae, with attached portions of the first, second, and third pairs of ribs, are removed with the neck. The scalene muscles and the longus colli are therefore preserved intact. The structures contained within the middle cranial fossa may now be examined, and, in carrying out this dissection, the head should be supported on a block so that the floor of the cranial cavity looks upwards.

HEAD AND NECK. 462- placed on the posterior part of the dorsum in two rows, which diverge from each other in an outward and forward direction, like the two limbs of the letter V- The foramen caecum forms the apex of the V> and the papillae vary in number from seven to twelve. In form a circumvallate papilla is broad and somewhat cylindrical, slightly narrower at its attached than at its free extremity, and sunk in a pit. It is surrounded by a deep trench, the walls of which are slightly raised beyond the general surface of the mucous membrane. The free extremity of each papilla is therefore encircled by an annular elevation, which is termed the vallum. The fungiform papilla are much smaller, but are present in much greater numbers. They are chiefly found on the tip and sides of the tongue, but they are also scattered at irregular intervals over the dorsum. They are very characteristic in form. Each papillae presents a large, full, rounded knob-like extremity, while it is greatly constricted at the point where it springs from the mucous surface. In the living tongue the fungiform papillae are distinguished by their bright red colour. The conical papilla are present in very large numbers. They are smaller than the fungiform variety, and although they are quite visible to the naked eye, they can be more conveniently studied by the aid of an ordinary pocket-lens. They are minute conical projections from the mucous membrane which taper towards their free extremities, and occupy the dorsum and sides of the tongue in front of the foramen

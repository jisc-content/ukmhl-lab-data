284 HEAD AND NECK. depends very much upon that of the palatine branch or the ascending pharyngeal. Internal Jugular Vein.â€”The internal jugular vein is the largest venous channel of the neck. It is directly continuous with the lateral sinus' of the cranial cavity, and it enters the neck through the posterior compartment of the jugular foramen. From this it proceeds downwards, until it reaches the posterior aspect of the inner end of the clavicle, where it joins the subclavian vein to form the innominate or brachio-cephalic vein. Its commencement in the jugular foramen shows a slight dilatation termed the bulb, the lumen of which remains at all times patent owing to the connection of its walls to the margins of the foramen. By passing a probe from the lateral sinus into the internal jugular vein the continuity of the two channels can be easily demonstrated. The relations which the internal jugular vein presents in the neck can be summed up in a very few words. At the base of the skull it lies behind the internal carotid . artery, and rests upon the rectus lateralis muscle. Very soon, however, it changes its relationship to the internal carotid, and comes to lie upon its outer side. This position it maintains until it reaches the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. Below this level it is continued downwards upon the outer side of the common carotid artery. Throughout its whole length it is included within a sheath of fascia common to it, the two arteries and the vagus nerve. Lastly at the root of the neck its

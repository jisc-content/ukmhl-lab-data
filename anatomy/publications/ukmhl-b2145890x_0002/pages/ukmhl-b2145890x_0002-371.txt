The interspinous ligaments are most strongly developed in the lumbar regions, where they fill up the intervals between the adjacent margins of contiguous spinous processes. In the dorsal region, and more especially in the neck, they are very weak. The supraspinous ligaments are thickened bands which connect the summits of the spinous processes. In the neck they are replaced by the ligamentum nuchse (p. 65). The intertransverse ligaments are feebly marked in the cervical region, and extend chiefly between the anterior bars of the transverse processes. Axis, Atlas, and Occipital Bone—The articula- tions which exist between these three bones all belong to the diarthrodial class. Between the atlas and axis there are three such joints—viz., a pair between the opposed articular processes, and a third between the anterior face of the odontoid process and the posterior face of the anterior arch of the atlas. Between the atlas and occipital bone there are a pair of joints—viz., between the occipital condyles above and the elliptical cavities upon the upper aspect of the lateral masses of the atlas. The ligaments connecting these three bones together may be divided into three main groups as follows :— PART III.

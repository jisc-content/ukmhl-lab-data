5 SCALP. a fine expansion over the temporal fascia. In this locality it gives origin to two of the small auricular muscles. Divide the epicranial aponeurosis by a mesial incision of about an inch and a-half in length, and then carry across the middle of this a second short transverse cut. On raising the corners thus marked out, the aponeurosis will be seen to rest upon a layer of loose flocculent areolar tissue, containing no fat— the fourth stratum of the scalp. Owing to the great laxity of this tissue, the occipito-frontalis muscle by its contractions can move the hairy scalp freely over the pericranium which invests the bone. Extrinsic Muscles of the Ear.—In man these muscles are very poorly developed, and the auricle possesses in consequence only a very limited power of independent movement. They are three in number, viz.:— (i.) Attollens aurem. (2.) Attrahens aurem. (3.) Retrahens aurem. The two first of these are so thin that it requires an experienced and careful dissector to isolate them from the superficial fascia. Attollens aurem—-Fig. 1 (1).—To expose this muscle the upper part of the auricle must be dragged down- wards, and then fixed in this position by means of a hook. The muscular fibres are thus rendered tense and stand out in relief. When cleaned it will be seen to be a fan-shaped muscle, placed immediately above

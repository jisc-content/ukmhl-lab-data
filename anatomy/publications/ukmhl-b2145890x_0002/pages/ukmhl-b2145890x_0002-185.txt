ROOT OF THE NECK. and disappears from view between the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib. It has been already noticed in the dissection of the back of the neck (p. 65). The superior intercostal artery turns downwards over the neck of the first rib, close to the outer side of the sympathetic cord, and ends in the thorax by giving branches to the upper two intercostal spaces. The deep cervical vein is a large vessel. It joins the vertebral vein. The Subclavian Vein is the continuation of the axillary vein into the root of the neck. It begins, therefore, at the outer border of the first rib, and arches inwards in front of the scalenus anticus muscle close to its insertion. At the inner margin of this muscle it joins the internal jugular to form the innominate vein. In connection with the subclavian vein, note: (1.) that the arch which it forms is not so pronounced as in the case of the corresponding artery; (2.) that throughout its whole course it lies at^ajJwer levd, and upon a plane anterior to the artery, and (3.) that itjs^separated fr^nTthe artery by the scalenus antic^i and the phrenic nerve. " The tributaries of the subclavian vein are (1.) the external jugular vein, and (2.) in some cases the anterior jugular vein. These join it at the outer margin of the scalenus anticus muscle.â€”(Fig. 24.)

The lingual branches pierce the substance of the tongue, and then incline upwards to supply the mucous membrane with the conical and fungiform papillae over the anterior two-thirds of this organ. Submaxillary Ganglion. - This is a minute ganglion which will be found lying upon the upper part of the hyo-glossus muscle in the interval between the lingual nerve and the deep part of the sub- maxillary gland, under cover of the mylo-hyoid muscle In size it is not larger than the head of a large pin, and, when freed from the connective tissue surrounding both it and its branches, it will be seen to be suspended from the lingual nerve by two short, well-marked branches, which enter its upper border,

HEAD AND NECK. passing backwards and downwards, superficial to the submaxillary gland and facial artery. After picking up tributaries corresponding to the branches of the similar part of the artery, it joins the anterior division of the temporo-maxillary vein. The short trunk thus formed is termed the common facial vein, and it pours its blood into the internal jugular at the level of the hyoid bone. The Internal Maxillary Artery will be dis- played in the dissection of the pterygo-maxillary space. Occipital Artery.—The occipital artery springs from the posterior aspect of the external carotid at the same level as the facial. It takes the lower border of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle as its guide, and runs upwards and backwards to reach the interval between the mastoid process and the trans- verse process of the atlas. From this onwards it has been studied in the dissection of the scalp and the back of the neck (pp. 12, 49, and 61). The first part of the vessel which is at present under notice will be observed to cross the internal carotid artery, the vagus nerve, the spinal accessory nerve, and the internal jugular vein. The hypoglossal nerve hooks round it, and it is overlapped by the lower border of the pos- terior belly of the digastric muscle. The only branches which spring from this portion of the occipital are:—(1.) muscular twigs; and (2.) a meningeal branch.

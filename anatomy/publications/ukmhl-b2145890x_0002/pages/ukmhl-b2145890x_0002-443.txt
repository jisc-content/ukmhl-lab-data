THE AUDITORY NERVE. 425 ing upwards and forwards in a narrow canal in the petrous portion of the temporal bone (iter chordae posterius) it appears in the tympanum below the base of the pyramid, and close to the posterior margin of membrana tympani. The bony tunnel which it occupies can easily be opened up in a decalcified bone, but is somewhat difficult to expose in the hard bone. The chorda tympani now runs forwards upon the upper part of the membrana tympani under cover of the mucous layer. It crosses the handle of the maleus near its root. To display it in this part of its course, the incus bone should be removed. Finally, reaching the anterior end of the tympanic cavity it crosses the processus gracilis of the maleus, and near the inner end of the Glaserian fissure, it enters a canal (canal of Huguier) which conducts it to the exterior of the skull. With a little care the canal of Huguier can be opened up by the chisel and bone-pliers. From this point to its junction with the lingual nerve the chorda tympani has already been traced (p. 262). The Auditory Nerve.â€”In the internal auditory meatus the auditory nerve lies at a lower level than the facial, and at the bottom of the passage it splits into two parts. Of these, one is directed forwards to the cochlea, and the other proceeds outwards to the vestibule. THE LARYNX. The lateral' portions of the lower jaw which are still attached by mucous membrane to the sides of

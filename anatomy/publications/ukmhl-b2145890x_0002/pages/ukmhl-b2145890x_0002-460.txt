442 HEAD AND NECK. half of the inner surface of the ala of the thyroid cartilage, close to the angle, and also from the crico- thyroid membrane. Its fibres pass backwards and are inserted into the outer border and muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage. A certain porportion of its fibres turn upwards and backwards to reach the epiglottis. These constitute the thyro-epiglotti- dean muscle. The thyro-arytenoideus interims is a slender three- sided muscular band which is closely applied to the outer side of the true vocal cord, and receives its prismatic form from this adaptation. It arises in front from the angular depression between the two alee of the thyroid cartilages, and is inserted behind into the outer aspect of the processus vocalis, and also into the adjoining part of the antero- external surface of the arytenoid cartilage. The thyro-arytenoideus internus is thicker behind than in front. This is due to the fact that whilst all the fibres which compose it are attached to the ary- tenoid cartilage, only a certain proportion obtain origin from the thyroid cartilage. A large number of the deeper fibres are directly attached at different points to the outer side of the true vocal cord. These constitute the ary-vocalis muscle * (Ludwig). *A muscle termed the thyro-arytenoideus superior is fre- quently present. It is a slender band which arises from the inner aspect of the ala of the thyroid cartilage close to the notch, and passes backwards and downwards to find insertion into the lateral border of the arytenoid cartilage immediately above the processus muscularis.

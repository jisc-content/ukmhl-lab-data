HEAD AND NECK. 98 Anterior Surface. (i.) Linea splendens. (2.) Single anterior spinal artery in mesial plane. (3.) Anterior nerve - roots smaller than posterior, and springing by fasci- culi which emerge from the cord, not in a con- tinuous straight line, but irregularly over an area of some width. Posterior Surface. (1.) Two posterior spinal arteries. (2.) Fasciculi of origin of posterior nerve - roots entering the cord along a straight and continu- ous line. (3.) Posterior nerve-roots larger than the anterior, and provided with ganglia. In its present state, the cord is so soft that its constituent parts cannot properly be studied. The dissector should immerse it for a few" weeks'in methylated spirit, or in a large quantity of a saturated solution of bichromate of potash, to harden it Its further examination had therefore better be deferred until the anatomy of the brain is studied. SIDE OP THE NECK. Four days having now been devoted to the dissec- tion of the posterior aspect of the body, the subject is turned on its back, and blocks being placed under the thorax and pelvis, the dissection of the side of the neck is commenced. This region may be said to present a somewhat quadrilateral figure. In front it is bounded by the middle line of the neck ; behind^ it is limited by a line corresponding to the anterior margin of the trapezius muscle; below, is the pro- minent clavicle ; above, the base of the lower jaw, and a line drawn from this to the occiput.

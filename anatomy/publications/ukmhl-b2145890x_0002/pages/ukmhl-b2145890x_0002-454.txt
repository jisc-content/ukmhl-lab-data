436 HEAD AND NECK. the membrane on each side is thickened, rounded, and cord-like {ligamentum thyro-hyoideum laterale), and is chiefly composed of elastic fibres. It extends from the tip of the great cornu of the hyoid bone to the extremity of superior cornu of the thyroid cartilage. In this ligament there is usually developed a small oval cartilaginous or bony nodule, which is termed the cartilago triticea. The Crico-thyroid Muscle is placed on the side of the cricoid cartilage, and bridges over the lateral portion of the crico-thyroid interval. Taking origin from the lower border and outer surface of the anterior arch of the cricoid cartilage, its fibres spread out in an upward and backward direction, and are inserted into the inner aspect of the lower margin of the thyroid cartilage, and also into the anterior border of its inferior cornu. As a general rule it is divided into two parts. The anterior or oblique part is composed of those fibres which are attached to the ala of the thyroid cartilage ; the posterior or horizontal part is formed of those fibres which are inserted into the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage. It is closely associated with the inferior constrictor muscle. The crico-thyroid muscle is supplied by the external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. The Middle portion of the Crico-thyroid Membrane can be studied in the interval between the two crico-thyroid muscles. It is a tense elastic

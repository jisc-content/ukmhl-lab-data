128 HEAD AND NECK. saclenus medius by the union of two roots which proceed from the fifth and sixth cervical nerves respectively. Emerging from the substance of the scalenus medius, it is carried downwards behind the plexus and the first part of the axillary artery. It is devoted entirely to the supply of the serratus magnus. Removal of the Arm.—At this stage, the dissector of the upper limb removes the arm from the trunk. The dissector of the head and neck must see that the vessels and nerves are not cut too short. The lower border of the first rib is the level at which they should be divided. Anterior Triangle.—Let the head hang well over the end of the table, and, raising the lower jaw as much as possible, fix it in this position by means of hooks. Begin the dissection by throwing the super- ficial cervical and infra-maxillary nerves backwards and then carefully raise the cervical fascia from the area in front of the sterno-mastoid. The anterior triangle is now exposed. Before proceeding further, however, let the student recall the structures which he has removed to display this space. He has reflected the skin, the superficial fascia, the platysma, and the deep cervical fascia, whilst between the two last he has followed the ramifications of the superficial cervical and infra-maxillary nerves, and traced down- wards the anterior jugular vein. These parts therefore constitute the coverings of the triangle.

ROOT OF THE NECK. 165 The inferior laryngeal artery is a small vessel which accompanies the recurrent laryngeal nerve to the larynx. The tracheal and (Esophageal branches in like manner supply the trachea and gullet. They are of small size, and anastomose with the bronchial and oesophageal branches of the thoracic aorta. The thyroid or terminal branches inosculate freely with the corresponding vessels of the opposite side, and also with the branches of the superior thyroid artery. The muscular branches are a series of irregular twigs given to the various muscles in the neighbourhood. The inferior thyroid vein does not run in company with the artery of the same name. It is a large vessel which comes from the lateral lobe of the thyroid body, and descends upon the trachea under cover of the sterno-thyroid muscle. The veins of both sides enter the thorax, and unite to open into the left innominate trunk, although, in some cases, the right vein may open separately into the angle of union between the two innominate veins Both vems receive, as they proceed down, tributaries from the larynx, trachea, and oesophagus. The small ascending cervical vein opens into the vertebral vein. The Supra-scapular and Transversalis Colli Arteries have already been examined in the greater part of their course (p. I2I). observe in the present dissection that after taking origin from the thyroid axis, they both pass outwards upon the scalenus

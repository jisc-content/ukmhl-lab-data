338 HEAD AND NECK. if the opening for the inferior oblique possesses one. The connections of the capsule of Tenon to the walls of the orbital cavity are very complicated. The suspensory ligament described by Mr. Lockwood is perhaps the most important of these. It stretches across the fore part of the orbit after the fashion of a hammock, and gives support to the eyeball. Its two extremities are narrow, and are attached respect- ively to the malar and lachrymal bones. Below the eyeball it widens out and blends with the capsule of Tenon. The external and internal check ligaments also constitute bonds of union between the capsule of Tenon and the orbital wall. They are strong bands which pass from the sheaths around the external and internal recti muscles to obtain attachment to the malar and lachrymal bones respectively ; here they are brought into association with the extremities of the suspensory ligament. The function of the check ligaments is easily understood. They limit the con- traction of the external and internal recti muscles, and thus prevent excessive rotation of the eyeball in an outward or inward direction. There is a similar but less direct provision by means of which the action of the superior and inferior recti muscles is limited. The action of the former muscle is checked through its intimate connection with levator palpebral superi- ors in the fore part of the orbit; the action of the inferior rectus is checked through its connection with the suspensory ligament * * For further information regarding the capsule of Tenon the

The amphiarthrodial joint (Fig. 38) occupies by far the greatest part of the space which exists between the vertebral bodies, and it presents the usual characters of such an articulation. The opposed bony surfaces are coated by a thin layer of hyaline or encrusting cartilage, and are brought into direct union by an interposed Fig. 38.

The intervertebral discs are distinctly deeper in front than behind, and upon this the cervical curvature in great measure depends. The two diarthrodial joints are placed one on each side, where the disc of fibro-cartilage fails. They are of small extent, and are confined entirely to the intervals between the projecting lateral lips of the upper surface of the centrum, and the bevelled off lateral margins of the lower surface of the vertebral

THE THYRO-ARY-EPIGLOTTIDEAN MUSCLE. 443 The Thyro-ary-epiglottidean Muscle is com- posed of fibres derived from the arytenoideus obliquus and the thyro-arytenoideus externus. They meet in the upper part of the aryteno-epiglottidean fold of mucous membrane, and are inserted into the margin of the epiglottis. Dissection.—The lateral crico-arytenoid muscle should now be carefully removed, and at the same time the dissector should endeavour to disengage the fibres of the thyro-arytenoideus externus from the deeper thyro-arytenoideus internus, in order that its relation to the true vocal cord may be studied. Finally remove the entire thyro-arytenoid muscle. This will display the outer surface of the lateral part of the crico-thyroid membrane, the true vocal cord or inferior thyro-arytenoid ligament, and the wall of the laryngeal sinus. By carefully dissecting between the two layers of mucous membrane which clothe the false vocal cord, the weak superior thyro-arytenoid ligament which gives it support may be discovered as well as a number of racemose glands which lie in relation to it. Lateral part of the Crico-thyroid Membrane. —The central part of the crico-thyroid membrane, as we have noted, closes in front the interval between the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. On each side, however, the lateral part of the same membrane is not attached to the lower border of the thyroid cartilage, but slopes upwards and inwards and

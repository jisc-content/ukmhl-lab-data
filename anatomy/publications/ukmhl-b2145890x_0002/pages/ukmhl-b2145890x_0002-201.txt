LINGUAL ARTERY. 183 thyroid artery are distributed for the most part upon the superficial aspect of the thyroid body. One branch, however, is given to the deep surface of the lateral lobe, and another is carried inwards across the trachea, along the upper border of the isthmus. These thyroid branches anastomose freely with the inferior thyroid arteries, and with the corresponding vessel of the opposite side. The superior thyroid vein emerges from the upper part of the thyroid body. It receives tributaries, which, in a great measure, correspond with the branches of the artery, and crosses the upper part of the common carotid to join the internal jugular vein. Lingual Artery.â€”Only a very small portion of this artery is seen in the present dissection. It springs from the external carotid, a short distance above the superior thyroid. In the first instance, it takes an upward course, but very soon it changes its direction, and bends suddenly downwards to reach the upper border of the hyoid bone, where it disappears from view by passing forwards under cover of the hyo- glossus muscle. It will subsequently be traced to its ultimate distribution in the dissection of the submax- illary region. Note in the meantime, however, that the part under observation lies in the carotid triangle, that the loop which it forms is crossed by the hypo- glossal nerve, and that it gives off one branch termed the hyoid artery. The hyoid branch springs from the lingual, close to

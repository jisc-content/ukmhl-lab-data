NERVES OF THE FACE. 221 The palpebral or terminal branch of the lachrymal appears in the upper eyelid above the outer canthus where it pierces the superior palpebral ligament, and gives filaments to skin and conjunctiva. The infra-trochlear nerve will be found above the tendo oculi and the inner canthus. The twigs into which it divides communicate with the facial and supply the lachrymal sac, the conjunctiva, and the skin of the eyelids, and the root of the nose. The nasal nerve reaches the face on the side of the nose. To expose it, divide the compressor naris, and it will be found appearing between the lower margin of the nasal bone and the upper lateral cartilage. It gives branches to the integument of the nose and communicates with the facial nerve. It can be traced downwards under cover of the compressor muscle to the tip of the nose. The branches of the superior maxillary division of the fifth nerve which appear on the face are three in numberâ€”viz., the temporal branch of the orbital nerve, which has been already studied * (p. 9); the malar branch of the orbital nerve; and the infra- orbital. The malar nerve {ramus subcutaneus malce) is an exceedingly minute twig which emerges on the face through a minute foramen on the outer surface of the malar bone, a short distance behind the external * If the finger be carried downwards from the external angular process of the frontal bone along the posterior margin of the malar bone, a tubercle on the latter will be felt. This is the guide to the temporal branch of the orbital; it pierces the temporal fascia immediately behind it.

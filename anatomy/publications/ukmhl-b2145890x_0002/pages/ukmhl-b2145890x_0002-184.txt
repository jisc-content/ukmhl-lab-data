X66 HEAD AND NECK. anticus, and under cover of the clavicular head of the sterno-mastoid. The supra-scapular crosses the scalene muscle close to its insertion, immediately above the subclavian vein ; the transversahs colli is placed at a slightly higher level. Further, note that both vessels cross in front of the phrenic nerve. The supra-scapular and transversal* colli veins have already been seen joining the subclavian or external jugular vein. Internal Mammary Artery.-This artery springs from the lower aspect of the subclavian opposite the thyroid axis, and, like it, under cover of the internal jugular vein. It at once proceeds downwards upon the pleura and behind the inner end of the clavicle to reach the thoracic cavity. In the cervical part of its course it will be observed to pass behind the sub- clavian vein, and to be crossed from without inwards by the phrenic nerve. In the neck, the internal mam- mary artery is accompanied by no companion vein. Superior Intercostal Artery.-This branch takes origin from the posterior aspect of the second portion of the subclavian artery, close to the inner border of the scalenus anticus. On the left side, however, it as a rule proceeds from the first part of the parent trunk. To bring it into view the subclavian artery must be dislodged from its position. It will then be seen to be a short trunk which almost immediately divides into the deep cervical artery, and the superior intercostal artery proper. The deep cervical artery passes at once backwards,

398 HEAD AND NECK. they are separated by a fissure which runs upwards for some distance on each side. The lower and anterior border is very short; it is free, and extends backwards to the anterior nasal spine. The anterior angle of the septal cartilage is blunt and rounded, and does not reach to the point of the nose, which is thus formed by the cartilages of the aperture (p. 240). The deviation of the septum nasi from the mesial plane will now (in all probability) be seen to be due to a bulging to one side of the vomer and mes- ethmoid along their line of union. It is not developed until after the seventh year of life (Zucker- kandl). Nerves and Vessels of the Septum Nasi.—The septal cartilage and thin bony laminae must now be removed piecemeal. This must be done very care- fully, as it is necessary to preserve intact the mucous . membrane which clothes the opposite side of the septum. It is in this that the nerves and blood vessels must be examined. The following is a list of the nerves:— Nerves of) Qlfact Smell, . j , 1. Naso-palatine, or nerve of Cotunnius. Nerves of j ^ Septal brancn 0f the nasal proper. Common I ^ Nagal brancnes from Meckel's gang- Sensation, I lion and the vidian nerve. The inner group of olfactory nerves which are distributed in the mucous membrane of the upper part of the nasal septum are barely distinguish-

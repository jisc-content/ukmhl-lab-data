4i8 HEAD AND NECK. In tracing the posterior palatine nerve forwards in the palate, the dissector should note the numerous glands which are placed under the mucous membrane of the vault of the mouth, and the manner in which these indent the bone * Pharyngeal and Vidian nerves.--Very considerable difficulty will be experienced in exposing these nerves. They proceed backwards from the posterior part of the ganglion in canals which are very inaccessible. Ihz pharyngeal nerve occupies the pterygopalatine canal, and is distributed to the mucous membrane of the upper part of the pharynx. To open up this canal the sphenoidal process of the palate bone must be cautiously removed by the bone-forceps, and then the dissector should proceed to open up the Vidian canal, which traverses the root of the pterygoid process. As the bone is very hard and brittle at this point, the dissection must be effected very carefully. The Vidian nerve has previously been seen to be formed by a junction between the great superficial petrosal branch of the facial and the great deep petrosal branch of the carotid plexus (p. 313> lt traverses *e Vidian canal, and joins the posterior aspect of the .anglion, of which it may be considered to constitute the motor and sympathetic roots, tn the canal it is invested by a strong fibrous envelope, and when this membrane and glands.

Venous tributaries which eome from the cerebellum back part of the cerebrum, and from the dip oe of the cranial bones, may be noticed opening into the lateral sinus. . . Two large and important emissary veins connect it with the veins of the scalp, and allow its blood, when it is overcharged, to drain partly away in this d.rectiom These are the mastoidal vein, joining it through the mastoid foramen-Fig. 24 00, P- ^-and^posterior condyloid vein, which joins it through the postenor condyloid foramen.

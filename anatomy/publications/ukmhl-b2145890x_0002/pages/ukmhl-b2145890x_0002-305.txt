GLOSSO-PHARYNGEAL. 287 sheath of dura mater. They therefore traverse the foramen in close contact with each other. Reaching the exterior of the skull the three nerves at first lie together with the ninth or hypoglossal nerve in the interval between the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery, but soon they choose different routes. The spinal accessory inclines backwards over or behind the internal jugular vein; the glossopharyngeal inclines forwards over the internal carotid ; whilst the vagus proceeds vertically downwards between these vessels. In an ordinary dissection it is impossible to follow out many of the minute twigs which take origin from these nerves in the region of the basis cranii. To do so it is necessary to possess a perfectly fresh part, which has been specially prepared by having the soft parts toughened with spirit and the bone softened by immersion in a weak solution of acid. Even then the dissection is a difficult one, although it should certainly be undertaken by the advanced student in the event of his being able to obtain a part for the purpose. In the following description of these nerves the account of the branches which can in all cases be traced is printed in large type, whilst that of those requiring special dissection is printed in small type. Glosso - pharyngeal. â€” The glosso - pharyngeal nerve inclines downwards and forwards and crosses the internal carotid artery superficially. It passes under cover of the styloid process and the stylo-

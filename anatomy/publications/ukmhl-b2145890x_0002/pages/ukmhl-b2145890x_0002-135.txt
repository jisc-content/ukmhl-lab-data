117 TRIANGLES OF THE NECK. is left between them, and it is only after the fascial connections of the muscle have been divided that the triangle becomes well marked. Cases also occur in which the omo-hyoid takes partial or complete origin from the clavicle, and thus the space is still further reduced in size. Another condition which very materially affects the dimensions of the supra- clavicular triangle is the muscular development of the subject. The more powerful the neck, the wider are the attachments of the trapezius and sterno- mastoid to the clavicle, and the narrower in conse- quence is the triangle. In a few instances these muscles will be observed to meet on the clavicle, and thus obliterate the space altogether. This latter condition, however, is not necessarily associated with a specially high development of the muscles. Contents.—In the occipital triangle the contents have already been in a great measure examined (p. 48). They are:— (1.) The occipital artery in a very small part of its course, and only when the sterno-mastoid fails to meet the trapezius at the apex of the triangle. (2.) The spinal accessory nerve. (3.) The branches from the third and fourth cervical nerves which cross the space to supply the trapezius ^muscle. (4-) The superficial branches of the cervical plexus as they appear at the posterior border of the sterno- mastoid previous to piercing the deep fascia. (5-) Branches of supply to the levator anguli scapulae from the third and fourth cervical nerves.

302 "w HEAD AND NECK. connection between it and the middle ganglion is generally in the form of several slender nerve-cords, of which one or two pass in front of the subclavian artery. The loops which are thus formed are termed ansce Vieussienii. The branches of the inferior cervical ganglion are:— (i.) Connecting twigs to the seventh and eighth cervical nerves. (2.) Nervi molles. (3.) Inferior cardiac nerve. The nervi molles are large branches which form a more apparent sympathetic plexus around the vertebral artery than that possessed by any other blood vessel of the neck. This must be associated with the large sympathetic branch which we have seen accompanying the internal carotid, and no doubt points to the exercise of a more thorough control over these intra-cranial blood-vessels. The lower cardiac nerve on both sides enters the deep cardiac plexus. It is connected with the recurrent laryngeal nerve and not unfrequently also with the middle cardiac nerve. Rectus Capitis Lateralis.—This little muscle should now be cleaned, and its attachments denned. It lies in the interval between the transverse process of the atlas and the occiput, behind the commence- ment of the internal jugular vein. The anterior

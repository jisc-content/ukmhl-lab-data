OTIC GANGLION. 393 carry the knife backwards through the buccinator and mucous membrane of the cheek, the pterygo-maxillary ligament, and the lateral wall of the pharynx. The internal pterygoid muscle has already been divided, but it will be necessary to cut the internal carotid artery with the vessels and nerves which still connect the pharynx with the skull. The larynx and tongue may be laid aside for future dissection. The fore part of the skull should next be divided into two lateral parts by sawing it through in the sagittal direction close to one side of the nasal septum. As a general rule the nasal septum is not vertical, but deviates more or less to one or other side of the mesial plane. This deviation is more frequently directed to the right than to the left side. Endeavour to determine the direction which it takes in the skull under observation by passing a probe into the nasal fossse through the posterior nares. The section through the skull should be made close to the concave side of the septum. Begin in front by introducing a knife into the nostril of that side, and carrying it upwards through the cartilaginous part of the nose to the nasal bone. Then place the specimen so that the face rests upon the table, and divide the soft palate from before backwards in the same plane. The section may now be completed by sawing from behind forwards through the hard palate and bony roof of the nasal fossa. The dissector should make every effort to preserve the septum of the nose intact. As a general rule the upper turbinated bone is partially injured. This is not a very serious matter, as the

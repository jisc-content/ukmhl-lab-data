122 HEAD AND NECK. It has already been observed to end under cover of the anterior margin of the trapezius, by dividing into the posterior scapular and the superficial cervical arteries (p. 51). Veins.—The arrangement of the veins has been noticed in studying the relations of the subclavian artery. The external jugular vein crosses the third part of this artery and joins the subclavian vein. It is joined close to its termination by the supra-scapular and transversalis colli veins, and perhaps by the anterior jugular as it emerges from under cover of the sterno-mastoid. In many cases, however, the anterior jugular joins the subclavian vein directly. Floor of the Posterior Triangle.—The floor of the posterior triangular space is formed by a succes- sion of muscles, and at its very lowest part by a small portion of the first rib. In the occipital sub-division the dissector will observe that the floor is constituted from above downwards by—(1.) the splenius capitis; (2.) the levator anguli scapulae; and (3.) by the scalenus medius and posticus. At the apex of the triangle an additional factor may sometimes be observed—viz., a small portion of the complexus. In the supra-clavicular triangle the floor lies very deeply. It is formed by the scalenus medius and posticus, and a portion of the first rib. Section of the Clavicle.—In order that a satis- factory view be obtained of the nerves forming the brachial plexus, it is necessary to remove the middle

MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE. 4^3 caecum. They are arranged in parallel rows which are placed close together, and in the back part of the tongue these diverge from the mesial raphe" in a forward and outward direction. Towards the tip of the tongue the rows of conical papillae become more or less transverse in direction, and on the sides of the tongue they are arranged perpendicularly. Muscles of the Tongue.—The tongue is almost entirely composed of muscular fibres, with some adipose tissue intermixed. It is divided into two lateral halves by a mesial septum, and the muscles in connection with each of these consist of an intrinsic and an extrinsic group. They are as follows:— Extrinsic Muscles, ' (1.) Genio-hyo-glossus. (2.) Hyo-glossus. (3.) Chondro-glossus. (4.) Styloglossus. (5.) Palato-glossus. (1.) Superficial lingual. (2.) Inferior lingual. Intrinsic Muscles, <| ^ VerticaL (4.) Transverse. The extrinsic muscles take origin from parts outside the tongue, and thus are not only capable of giving rise to changes in the form of the organ, but also of producing changes in its position. The intrinsic muscles, which are placed entirely within the substance of the tongue, are, for the most part, only capable of giving rise to alterations in its form.

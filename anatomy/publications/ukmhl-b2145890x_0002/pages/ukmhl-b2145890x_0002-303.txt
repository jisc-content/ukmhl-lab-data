INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN. 285 terminal part crosses the first portion of the sub- clavian artery. But there are some slight differences to be noted between the two veins of opposite sides. The right vein is usually considerably the larger of the two, and as they approach the root of the neck they both incline slightly to the right. From this it follows that the left vein is closely applied to the lower portion of the common carotid artery of that side, whilst the right vein is separated from its com- panion vessel by a narrow interval which presents a triangular figure. The base of this triangle is formed by the first part of the subclavian artery and it is bisected by the vagus nerve. . The tributaries which join the internal jugular vein have for the most part been previously studied. They are:â€” (1.) Inferior petrosal sinus (P- 37)- (2.) Pharyngeal veins. (3.) Lingual veins (p. 277.) (4.) Common facial vein (p. 186). (5.) Superior thyroid vein (p. 183). (6.) Middle thyroid vein (p. 190 and p. 177). (7.) Thoracic duct on the left side and the right lymphatic duct on the right side (p. 167). The inferior petrosal sinus leaves the cranial cavity by the anterior compartment of the jugular foramen, and joins the forepart of the internal jugular vein close to the base of the skull. By passing a probe from the interior of the skull through the sinus its connection with the vein can readily be made out.

22 HEAD AND NECK. Next, removing the block upon which the head rests, and supporting the occiput and posterior lobes of the brain with the left hand, let the head drop we backwards. In all probability the frontal lobes will fall away by their own weight from the anterior fossa of the base of the cranium, and perhaps carry with them the olfactory bulbs. Should they remain in position, however, gently raise them with the fingers, and separate at the same time with the handle of the knife the olfactory bulbs from the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. In raising the olfactory bulbs, the minute olfactory nerves which spring from them and perforate the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone are torn across. The large round and white optic nerves (second pair of cranial nerves) now come mto view as they leave the cranium through the optic foramina. When these are divided the internal carotid arteries will be exposed, and between them in the mes.al plane the infundibulum, a hollow conical process which connects the pituitary body with the tuber cinereum-a lamina of grey matter on the base of he brain It will be noticed that the infundibulum lies slightly behind the internal carotid arteries.* Sever in turn each of these structures. We then come upon the occulo-motor nerves (third pair of cranial nerves), which must be dealt with in like manner. Observe first, however, that they lie behind, and external to the carotid trunks. The dissector should now see close to the brain on the other side.

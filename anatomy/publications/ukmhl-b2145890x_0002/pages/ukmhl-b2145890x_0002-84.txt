68 HEAD AND NECK. the neural arches of the atlas and axis vertebrae; the succeeding six make their appearance a short distance farther out by emerging from the intervertebral foramina and turning backwards under cover of the posterior inter-transverse muscles. The external branches are of small size, and are entirely devoted to the supply of muscles. They give twigs to the splenius colli and to the cervical and cranial prolongations of the erector spinas. The internal branches are not all distributed alike, nor indeed do they present the same relations. The second, third, fourth, and fifth nerves run inwards towards the spinous processes, superficial to the semi-spinalis colli muscle, and under cover of the complexus. When close to the mesial plane they turn backwards and pierce the complexus, splenius, and trapezius muscles to become superficial. In their course to the surface they give numerous twigs to the neighbouring muscles. The internal branch of the second nerve is remark- able for its large size. It receives the special name of great occipital It will be noticed turning round the lower border of the inferior oblique muscle, to which it supplies some twigs. The distribution of this nerve on the occiput has already been noticed (p. io). In passing to the surface it pierces the complexus and trapezius. To the former it gives several twigs. The internal branch of the third nerve likewise sends an offset to the occipital portion of the scalp (p. 45). The internal branches of the lower three posterior divisions of the cervical nerves resemble the preceding,

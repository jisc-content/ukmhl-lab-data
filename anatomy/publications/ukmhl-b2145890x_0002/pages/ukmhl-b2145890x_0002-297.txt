THE STYLO-PHARYNGEUS. glossopharyngeal nerve has not been previously seen (p. 217), it should now be carefully sought for. The external carotid artery may be divided immediately below the point where it divides into its two terminal branches. After cutting the occipital and posterior auricular arteries, it can be turned forwards out of the way. Of the parts in connection with the styloid process, the stylo-hyoid and stylo-glossus muscles and the stylo-hyoid ligament have been already fully examined; the stylo-pharyngeus alone remains to be described. In cleaning the fibres of this muscle, be very careful of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve which appears at its lower border, and gives to it its nerve of supply. The Stylo-pharyngeus is the longest of the three slender muscles which spring from the styloid process. It arises from its deep or inner surface close to its root, and extends downwards and forwards to gain the side of the pharynx. Here it disappears under cover of the upper border of the middle constrictor, and its fibres spread out to be inserted for the most part into the upper and hinder borders of the thyroid cartilage ; a certain proportion, however, are lost in the wall of the pharynx. The stylo-pharyngeus muscle is supplied by a branch from the glosso- pharyngeal nerve. Dissection.â€”Snip through the base of the styloid process with the bone-pliers, and throw it and its attached muscles downwards and forwards. The

2^2 HEAD AND NECK. superius) and the ganglion of the trunk {ganglion inferius). The Ganglion of the Root is situated within the jugular foramen. It is a rounded swelling which is connected by com- municating twigs with several of the nerves in the neighbourhood, and which gives off two branches of distribution. BRANCHES OF COMMUNICATION. BRANCHES OF DISTRIBUTION. (i.) With the petrous ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal. (2.) With the spinal accessory. (3.) With the superior ganglion of the sympathetic. (1.) Recurrent nerve. (2.) Auricular nerve. The recurrent branch is a minute twig which runs backwards through the jugular foramen, and, dividing into two branches, is distributed to the dura mater in the posterior cranial fossa. The auricular nerve (Arnold's nerve) obtains a filament 01 communication from the petrous ganglion of *e Â§losso-pharyn- aeal, and proceeds backwards upon the outer surface of the bulb of the internal jugular vein to enter a minute aperture on the posterior part of the outer wall of the jugular foramen A narrow clZ now conducts it through the substance of the temporal bone and, on its way, it crosses internal to the Fallopian cana a short distance above the stylo-mastoid foramen. It hus brought into close relation with the faQ^ner^e, and is onnected with it by an ascending and a Ascending branch ^ communication. Finally it appears on the surface of the skull nTe interval between the mastoid process and the external auditory meatus. Its further course is described on p. 217. After emerging from the jugular foramen, the vagus nerve is joined by the accessory portion of the spinal

FACIAL NERVE IN THE TEMPORAL BONE. 421 other cranial bones which still adhere to it, and, having fixed it in its natural position (in a vice if possible), remove the squamous portion by a horizon- tal saw-cut at the level of the superior border of the petrous bone. A second horizontal saw-cut should then be made through the pars petrosa immediately above the roof of the internal auditory meatus. If this is successfully carried out, the vestibule, the upper part of the tympanum, and the mastoidal cells are opened. Upon the upper part of the inner wall of the tympanum above the stapes and the foramen ovale, a prominent ridge will be noticed running from before backwards. This is the aqueduct of Fallopius. Extend the opening into the tympanum by removing the remainder of its roof, and then, with the chisel, open up the aqueduct as seen in this part of its course. The facial nerve is now exposed in what may be said to be its intermediate or tympanic part. To display its first stage within the bone, open up the internal auditory meatus by removing what remains of its roof, and follow the facial nerve forwards and outwards by means of the chisel. This will lead to the geniculate ganglionâ€”the swelling which marks the point at which the nerve bends backwards to enter the tympanic part of the aqueduct. Be careful at this point to secure the branches which proceed from the gangliform enlargement. The terminal part of the aqueduct of Fallopius is vertical, and its course can be indicated by pushing a fine pin upwards through the stylo-mastoid foramen. To open it, the mastoid process must be removed by a coronal

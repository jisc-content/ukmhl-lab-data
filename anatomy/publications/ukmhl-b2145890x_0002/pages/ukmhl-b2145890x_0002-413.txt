NASAL SEPTUM. 395 around the middle meningeal artery. In addition to these, the small superficial -petrosal nerve enters the posterior border of the ganglion, (p. 290, Fig. 34). The following are the branches which proceed from the otic ganglion :— fA twig which passes downwards and Branches of J forwards to the tensor palati. distribution. j A twig which proceeds upwards and back- v wards to supply the tensor tympani. / One or more fine filaments to one or both of Connecting J the roots of the auriculo-temporal nerve, branches. j A minute communicating filament to the v chorda tympani. Nasal Septum.—The nasal septum divides the cavity of the nose into two narrow chambers—the right and left nasal fossae. It is not placed accurately in the mesial plane, but almost invariably shows a bulging or deviation to one or other side, so as to reduce the width of one fossa, and increase the capa- city of the other. Immediately above the anterior aperture of the nasal fossa the septum shows a slight depression, which corresponds to the vestibule of the nose, and forms the inner wall of this subdivision of the chamber. The vestibular part of the partition is clothed by skin, continuous with the external integu- ment ; from this a number of stiff hairs termed vibrissce project. Over the rest of its extent the septum nasi is covered with mucous membrane, which is divided into two districts—viz., a lower or respiratory portion, and an upper or olfactory portion, in which the branches of the olfactory nerve spread out. The respiratory mucous membrane is very thick and

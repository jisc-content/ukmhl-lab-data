244 HEAD AND NECK. portion of the deep part which appears on the surface is a small piece at the upper and back part of the muscle. The masseter is inserted into the outer surface of the ascending ramus of the lower jaw, over an area which extends downwards to the angle, and upwards so as to include the outer aspect of the coronoid process. Dissection.—A dissection must now be undertaken to display the temporal muscle, and at the same time expose the nerve and artery of supply to the masseter. Begin by dividing the temporal fascia along the upper border of the zygomatic arch. It may then be thrown upwards and completely removed. The middle temporal artery, and the temporal branch of the temporo-malar nerve which pierce it must be dis- engaged from it and preserved. The zygomatic arch with the attached masseter must next be thrown down by dividing the bony arch in front and behind the origin of the muscle. First make use of the saw, and then complete the division by means of the bone- pliers The posterior cut should be made immediately in front of the glenoid fossa, and the head of the lower jaw • the anterior cut must extend obliquely through the malar bone, from the extreme anterior end of the upper margin of the arch, downwards and forwards to the point where the lower margin meets the malar process of the superior maxillary bone. In this way the whole of the masseteric origin is included between the incisions, and the arch with the attached muscle may be readily thrown downwards towards the angle

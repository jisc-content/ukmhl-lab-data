416 HEAD AND NECK. ( Vidian. Posterior branches, . \ pharyngeal Ascending branches,. Orbital. From the internal maxillary artery twigs are given off which accompany these nerves. The superior nasal and the naso-palatine nerves have been already described (pp. 399, 412). They arise from the inner aspect of the ganglion, but in some cases the naso-palatine may be seen to take origin from the commencement of the common palatine trunk, or even from one of the sphenopalatine branches of the superior maxillary nerve (Henle). The palatine nerves are three in number, and are distinguished as great or anterior, small or posterior, and external. As a rule these spring by a common trunk from the lower aspect of the ganglion. This descends in the posterior palatine canal, which has already been opened up, but to expose the nerves a dense fibrous investment must be removed. The nerve trunk will then be observed to break up into its three constituents. Trace, in the first instance, the two smaller nervesâ€”viz., the small and the external palatine branches. These leave the main canal, and enter smaller tunnels, which conduct them through the tuberosity of the palate bone. Before opening these up, it is well to secure the nerves as they emerge from the lower openings of the canals. This can very readily be done by dissecting behind the hamular process, and gently separating the soft parts from the under aspect of the tuberosity of the palate

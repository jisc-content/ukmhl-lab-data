HEAD AND NECK. 448 outer and back aspects of the arytenoid and cricoid cartilages. A well-marked twig proceeds from this branch and runs downwards upon the posterior aspect of the cricoid cartilage to join the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve has previously been seen to arise from the vagus, and it has been traced in the neck up to the point where it disappears under cover of the lower border of the inferior con- strictor muscle. It now is observed to ascend upon the outer aspect of cricoid cartilage, immediately behind the crico-thyroid joint. Here it is joined by the com- municating twig from the internal laryngeal nerve, and almost immediately afterwards it divides into two branches. The larger of these proceeds upwards, under cover of the ala of the thyroid cartilage, and breaks up into filaments which supply the lateral crico-arytenoid, the thyro-arytenoid, and the thyro- ary-epiglottidean muscles ; the smaller or posterior branch inclines upwards and backwards upon the posterior aspect of the cricoid cartilage, and under cover of the posterior crico-arytenoid muscle. It supplies twigs to this muscle, and is then continued onwards to end in the arytenoid muscle. The recurrent laryngeal nerve is therefore the motor nerve of the larynx. It supplies all the muscles with the exception of the crico-thyroid which draws its nerve-supply from the external laryngeal. The inferior laryngeal nerve, however, is usually considered to contain a few sensory fibres. These it gives to the

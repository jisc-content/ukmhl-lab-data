The Ascending Pharyngeal Artery is the smallest branch of the external carotid. It takes origin a short distance from the commencement of the parent trunk, and will be recognised by its pro- ceeding vertically upwards between the internal caro- tid and the pharynx. It will be subsequently traced in the deep dissection of the neck. The Superficial Temporal Artery cannot be displayed at present. In the dissection of the face the student will have an opportunity of studying it The Thyroid Body may now be examined and its connections made out. It is a highly vascular solid body, which clasps the upper part of the trachea, and extends upwards for some distance upon each side of the larynx. In size it varies greatly in different individuals, and in females and children it is always relatively larger than in adult males. It consists of three well-marked subdivisionsâ€”viz., two lateral lobes joined across the middle line by the isthmus. Each lateral lobe is somewhat conical in form, its base extending downwards as far as the fifth or the sixth tracheal ring, whilst its apex rests upon the side of the thyroid cartilage. Its superficial surface is full and rounded, and is clothed by the pre-tracheal layer of cervical fascia, from which it derives a sheath, and

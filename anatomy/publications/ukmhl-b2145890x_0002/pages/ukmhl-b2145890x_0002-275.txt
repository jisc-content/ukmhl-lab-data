INFRA-MAXILLARY DIVISION OF FIFTH NERVE. 257 through the foramen by the small motor root of the fifth nerve, and, a junction being effected between the two immediately after they gain the exterior of the cranium, a mixed nerve-trunk is the result. This nerve-trunk lies under cover of the external pterygoid muscle, and after a very short course (not exceeding Fig. 33. Diagram of the infra-maxillary division of the fifth cranial nerve.

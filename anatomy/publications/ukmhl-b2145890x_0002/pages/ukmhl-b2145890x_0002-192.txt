HEAD AND NECK. cover of the sterno-mastoid, and either behind or in front of the internal jugular vein, to join the des- cended noni and form the ansa hypoglossi. In some cases these twigs remain separate throughout all their course ; in other cases they unite. Phrenic nerve.--This is the most important nerve criven off by the cervical plexus. It springs from the fourth nerve, and usually also obtains a root from the fifth or third nerve, or perhaps from both. If the root from the fifth nerve fails, the phrenic will in all proba- bility be found to receive lower down a twig from the nerve to the subclavius. The course which the phrenic pursues in the neck is so definite, that there should never be any difficulty in recognising it. It descends, inclining at the same time inwards, in front of the scal- enus anticus, and leaves the neck to enter the thorax by passing under cover of the subclavian vein and crossing the internal mammary artery from without inwards. On the left side, it also crosses the first part of the subclavian artery. As it proceeds downwards on the scalenus anticus, it passes behind the omo- hyoid, the transversalis colli artery, the supra-scapular artery', and on the left side the thoracic duct. The phrenic nerve gives off no branches in the neck, but before it enters the thorax, it is usually joined by a small sympathetic twig. Communicating Branches.-(i.) At the base of the skull, the first loop of the cervical plexus is brought into close connection, by means of connecting twigs, with the vagus and hypoglossal nerves. These cannot

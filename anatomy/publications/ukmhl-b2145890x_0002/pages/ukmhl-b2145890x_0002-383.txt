THE CHEEKS. 365 LipS.—-The structure of the lips has in a great measure been already examined in the dissection of the face (p. 206). Each lip may be regarded as being composed of four layers. From before backwards these are—(1.) cutaneous; (2.) muscular; (3.) glandular; and (4.) mucous. The skin and mucous membrane become continuous with each other at the free margin of the lip. From the deep aspect of each lip the mucous membrane is reflected on to the alveolar margin of the corresponding jaw, and in the mesial plane it is raised in the form of a free fold. These folds are termed the frcenula ; in the dissection of the face they have been more or less destroyed. The muscular layer constitutes the chief bulk of the lips. It is formed by the orbicularis oris and the various muscles which converge to the mouth. The labial glands are very numerous and lie between the mucous membrane and the muscular fibres. In each lip there is an arterial arch formed by the corre- sponding coronary arteries (p. 225). The Cheeks have five layers entering into their construction, all of which have been examined in the dissection of the face. They are—(1.) skin, (2.) a fatty layer traversed by some of the facial muscles. (3.) the buccal aponeurosis, (4.) the buccinator, (5.) the mucous membrane. The buccal glands are very numerous and are situated between the buccinator muscle and the buccal aponeurosis (Sappey). Their ducts pierce the muscle and open upon the inner aspect of the mucous membrane. The buccal apon-

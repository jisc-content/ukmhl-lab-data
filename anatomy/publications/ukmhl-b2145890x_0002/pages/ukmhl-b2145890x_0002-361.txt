343 THE LONGUS COLIJ. thoroughly cleaned it will be seen to consist of three portionsâ€”viz., an upper and lower oblique part, and an intermediate vertical part. The lozver oblique division of the longus colli (Fig. 36, b) arises from the lateral aspect of the bodies of the upper two or three dorsal vertebrae. It extends upwards and slightly outwards, and ends in two tendinous slips which are inserted into the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae. In the interval between this portion of the longus colli and the scalenus anticus, the vertebral artery will be observed. The upper oblique part of the longus colli (Fig. 36, c) arises by three tendinous slips from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebrae, and tapers some- what as it proceeds upwards and inwards, to obtain a pointed and tendinous insertion into the anterior tubercle of the atlas. The vertical part of the muscle (Fig. 36, a) is much the largest of the three divisions, and it lies along the inner side of the oblique portions, with both of which it is more or less intimately connected. Thus below, it arises in common with the inferior oblique part by two or three slips from the sides of the bodies of the upper two or three dorsal vertebrae; above this it derives additional slips of origin from the bodies of the lower two cervical vertebrae; lastly, its outer border is rein- forced by slips from the transverse processes of the lower three .or four cervical vertebrae. It stretches vertically upwards and is inserted upon the inner

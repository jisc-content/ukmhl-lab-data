THE LEVATOR PALPEBR^E SUPERIORIS. 321 small flattened body of an oval form, and distinctly lobular structure, which is placed in the fore and outer part of the orbital cavity. It consists of two parts or lobes—an orbital and a palpebral—imperfectly separ- ated from each other. The orbital part constitutes the main mass of the gland. Its outer surface is convex, and is lodged in a hollow upon the inner aspect of the external angular process of the frontal bone. To this it is bound by short fibrous bands which proceed from the periosteum. The deep or inner surface is concave, and rests upon the upper and outer aspect of the eyeball in contact with the superior and external recti muscles. The small palpebral lobe is placed in front of the orbital part, from which it is separated by a thin layer of fascia. It projects into the back part of the upper eyelid> and rests upon the conjunctiva which lines the under aspect of the lid. This portion of the gland has been already examined in the dissection of the eyelids (p. 235); but even in the undissected subject it can be seen through the conjunctiva if the upper eyelid be fully everted. The lachrymal gland secretes the tears, and its ducts (twelve to fourteen in number) open in a row upon the under surface of the upper eyelid along the line of the fornix (p. 235). The Levator Palpebrae Superioris rests upon the upper surface of the rectus superior. Behind it is narrow and pointed, but it expands as it passes forwards above the eyeball to reach the upper eyelid. part in. Y

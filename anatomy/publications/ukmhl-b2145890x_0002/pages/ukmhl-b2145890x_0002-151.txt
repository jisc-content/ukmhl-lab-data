133 TRIANGLES OF THE NECK. upon the ala of the thyroid cartilage. In the interval between them the external laryngeal nerve and the crico-thyroid artery will be seen running forwards along the oblique line on the thyroid cartilage. In some cases it lies superficial to the sterno-thyroid muscle; more frequently, however, it is placed under cover of it. Contents of the Lower or Muscular Triangle. —In this triangle will be found the following structures:— (1.) The sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles. (2.) The branches from the ansa hypoglossi to these muscles. (3.) The external laryngeal nerve. (4.) The superior thyroid artery. (5.) The greater part of the larynx, the thyroid body and the trachea. (6.)|The oesophagus on the left side. (7.) The recurrent laryngeal nerve. When the fascia is removed from this part of the anterior triangle, the only structures which come into view within its limits are the sterno-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscles. It is for this reason that the term muscular is applied to the space. As the dissection is proceeded with, however, the large nerve of supply for these muscles, which comes from the ansa hypo- glossi, will be found lying near the outer border of the sterno-thyroid and breaking up into numerous twigs. Towards the upper part of the space will be noticed the superior thyroid artery passing downwards under cover of the omo-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and sterno-hyoid muscles to reach the thyroid body. At

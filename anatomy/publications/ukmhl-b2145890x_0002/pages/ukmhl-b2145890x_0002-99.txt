DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. 83 posterior branches of the intercostal and lumbar veins. The anterior intraspinal venous plexus can hardly be dissected whilst the spinal cord and its membranes are in situ, but it will be more convenient to describe it at this stage. Indeed, the dissection is one of great difficulty, and not likely to be successful in ordinary cases. Like the preceding, it is composed of two longitudinal venous channels placed one upon either side of the posterior common ligament of the vertebral bodies, and joined by numerous transverse branches which cross the mesial plane under cover of this ligament. These transverse veins receive large tributaries from the interior of the vertebral bodies. Superiorly the main longitudinal channels communi- cate with the occipital and basilar sinuses within the cranium, whilst laterally, they give off branches which run towards the intervertebral foramina, and join the corresponding branches of the posterior inter- spinal plexus. Meninges of the Spinal Cord—Fig. 13.—The spinal cord, like the brain, with which it is continuous, is enveloped by three membranes termed meninges. The most external investment is a strong fibrous membrane called the dura mater; the second, in order from without inwards, is a non-vascular tunic termed the arachnoid mater; whilst the third and most internal is the pia mater. These membranes are directly continuous with the corresponding investments of the brain. It is now the duty of the dissector to clean

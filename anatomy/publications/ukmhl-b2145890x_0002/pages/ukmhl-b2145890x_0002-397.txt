379 SOFT PALATE. the two arytenoid cartilages ; on either side stretches a sharp fold of mucous membrane called the aryteno- epiglottidean fold. During deglutition the epiglottis is folded backwards over this opening like a valve or a lid. The oesophageal opening is placed opposite the lower border of the cricoid cartilage. This is the narrowest part of the pharynx. Soft Palate.â€”The soft palate is a movable curtain, which intervenes between the buccal cavity and the pharynx. During deglutition, however, it is raised so as to shut off the upper nasal part of the pharynx, from the portion below, and at the same time open up the isthmus faucium. In front it is attached to the posterior margin of the hard palate ; laterally it is connected with the sides of the pharynx, whilst posteriorly it presents a free border. From the centre of this free margin the conical elevation termed the uvula projects. The upper surface of the soft palate is convex and continuous with the floor of the nasal fossae ; the inferior surface is concave and continuous with the vaulted roof of the mouth. Upon the latter surface may be seen a slightly marked mesial ridge or raphe, which indicates the original separation of the structure into two parts. The soft palate is composed of a fold of mucous membrane, between the two layers of which are interposed muscular, aponeurotic and glandular structures, together with blood-vessels and nerves.

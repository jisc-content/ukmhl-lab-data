ID4 HEAD AND NECK. Shortly after its origin, it effects, as a general rule, a communication with the internal jugular vein, and lower down one or more superficial twigs may connect it with the anterior jugular. Half-way down the neck it is joined by a tributary of some size which comes from the occipital region and the back of the upper part of the neck ; this vein is termed the posterior external jugular. Anterior Jugular Vein—Fig. 16 (23). — The anterior jugular vein should next be followed out. It is small in comparison with the preceding; some- times, however, it exceeds it in calibre-the size of the one very much depending upon that of the other It begins by the confluence of some minute veins in the sub-maxillary region, and then descends vertically at a short distance from the mesial plane. Immediately above the inner end of the clavicle it will be observed to dip through the deep cervical fascia. It terminates by turning abruptly outwards under cover of both heads of the sterno-mastoid muscle and opening into the external jugular or subclavian vein. After it has pierced he fascia, a short transverse branch which crosses the mesial plane connects it with its fellow of the opposite side {vide Fig. 24, p. 168). Superficial Branches of the Cervical H*™*-- These all take origin from the second, third, and fourth cervical nerves, and emerging from under cover of the posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid about its middle, pierce the deep fascia, and arrange

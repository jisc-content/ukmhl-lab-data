446 HEAD AND NECK. In front it is attached to the angular depression between the two alse of the thyroid cartilage, above the true vocal cords, and immediately below the attachment of the thyro-epiglottidean ligament, and extends backwards to be fixed to a tubercle on the antero-external surface of the arytenoid cartilage above the processus vocalis. It is composed of con- nective tissue and elastic fibres, which are continuous with the fibrous tissue in the aryteno-epiglottidean fold. Dissection.â€”Remove the remains of the aryteno- epiglottidean fold, the vocal cords, and the lateral part of the crico-thyroid membrane on the right side of the larynx, but be careful not to injure the arytenoid cartilage and the cartilage of the Santorini. Should the cuneiform cartilage be present in the aryteno-epiglottidean fold it should be detached and preserved. By this dissection a closer view of the side wall of the laryngeal cavity can be obtained. The undissected vocal cords of the left side should again be examined, the laryngeal sinus and pouch explored, and their precise connections and extent determined. When the student has satisfied himself upon these points he can proceed to display the vessels and nerves of the larynx. The superior laryngeal artery and the internal laryngeal nerve reach the larynx by piercing the outer thin part of the thyro-hyoid membrane. By applying traction to the nerve, and at the same time dividing the mucous membrane upon the inner surface of the thyro-hyoid ligament, they can easily be discovered.

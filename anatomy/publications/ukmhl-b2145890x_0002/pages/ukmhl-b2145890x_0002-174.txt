I 56 HEAD AND NECK. (1.) The scalene muscles. (2.) The phrenic nerve. (3.) The subclavian vessels and their branches. (4.) The cervical pleura. (5.) The thoracic duct on the left side, and the right lymphatic duct on the right side. (6.) The lower part of the internal jugular vein. (7.) The vagus nerve. (8.) The lower part of the common carotid artery. (9.) The lower part of the cervical sympathetic. As the dissection is proceeded with, a large number of important structures will be observed grouped in relation to the scalenus anticus muscle. Thus it is crossed in front and from below upwards by (1.) the sub- clavian vein, which lies upon its insertion into the first rib; (2.) anterior jugular vein; (3.) the supra-scapular artery; (4.) the transversalis colli artery, and (5.) the omo-hyoid muscle, with the nerve to its posterior belly. Under cover of these, the phrenic nerve is carried down- wards upon its anterior aspect, whilst the thoracic duct on the left side, and the right lymphatic duct on the right side, lie for a short distance in front of it, near its inner margin. Both of these ducts open into the venous system at the angle of union between the internal jugular and subclavian veins. Behind the scalenus anticus the cervical pleura bulges upwards for a short distance into the neck, and at a higher level the sub- clavian artery and the brachial nerves are also in relation to its posterior surface. Close to its inner margin, are the thyroid axis, the vertebral arteiy and vein and somewhat overlapping it, the large internal

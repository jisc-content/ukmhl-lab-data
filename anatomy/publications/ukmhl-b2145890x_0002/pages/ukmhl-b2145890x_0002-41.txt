27 TENTORIUM CEREBELLI. (3.) The falx cerebelli. (4.) The diaphragma sellae. Tentorium Cerebelli—Fig. 6 (4), and Fig. 5 (4), p. 21.—This is a large crescentic fold of dura mater which constitutes a membranous roof for the posterior fossa of the cranium, and at the same time forms a partition between the posterior lobes of the cerebrum and the cerebellum. It is not horizontal. It is accurately applied to the upper surface of the cerebellum. Its highest point, there- Fig. 6.

A very imperfect idea of its natural appearance, however, can be obtained in the present instance, seeing that its connections have been severed in the removal of the brain. Before it is disturbed it is perfectly tense, and this tension is due to its connec-

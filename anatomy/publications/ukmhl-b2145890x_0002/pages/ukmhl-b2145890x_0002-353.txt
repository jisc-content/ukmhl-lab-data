INFERIOR OBLIQUE MUSCLE. 335 cavernous sinus traced into the cavity, the dissector will observe that the arrangement of these nerves in the sphenoidal fissure is somewhat different from that in the sinus. The lachrymal, frontal, and fourth nerves enter the orbit above the muscles on very much the same plane. The other nerves enter between the heads of the external rectus. Of these the superior division of the third nerve is the highest, next comes the nasal nerve, then the inferior division of the third nerve, whilst the sixth nerve occupies the lowest level. Inferior Oblique Muscle.â€”This muscle is placed very differently from the other muscles of the orbit. It is situated below the eyeball, and turns round its inferior and outer surface. It must be dissected from the front. It is necessary therefore to restore the eye- ball to its natural place. Next, evert the lower eye- lid and remove the conjunctiva from its deep surface as it is reflected on to the globe of the eye. A little dissection in the floor of the fore part of the orbit and the removal of some fat will reveal the inferior oblique muscle. The inferior oblique muscle arises from a small de- pression on the orbital plate of the superior maxillary bone immediately to the outer side of the opening of the nasal duct. It passes outwards below the inferior rectus muscle, and inclining slightly backwards, ends in a thin, membranous tendon, which gains inser- tion into the outer aspect of the sclerotic coat of the

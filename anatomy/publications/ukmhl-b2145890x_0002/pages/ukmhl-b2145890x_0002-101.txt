85 DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK. the spinal dura mater. In the first place, its relation to the walls of the spinal canal is altogether different. In the skull, it is closely adherent to the cranial bones, and forms for them an internal periosteum j in the spinal canal, it is separated from the walls by areolar tissue and blood-vessels, and for the very obvious reason that were it adherent, it would interfere with the free movement of the vertebral column. Still, both anteriorly and laterally, certain connections do exist between the spinal walls and the dura mater. Thus the spinal nerves on either side, as they pierce the dura mater, carry with them into the intervertebral foramena tubular sheaths of the membrane, whilst anteriorly loose fibrous prolongations—more numerous above and below than in the dorsal region—connect the dura mater with the posterior common ligament. No connection of any kind exists between the dura mater and the neural arches or ligamenta subflava. Another feature which distinguishes the spinal from the cranial dura mater, is that its two com- ponent layers are not at any point separated to form venous channels, and that it gives off from its deep surface no partitions or septa. These points can be better appreciated when the tube of dura mater is opened. The dissector must therefore proceed to do this with the scissors. The incision should be carried through the membrane in the mesial plane. Care however must be taken not to injure the delicate arachnoid, which is subjacent. The interval between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater, which is now laid open, is termed

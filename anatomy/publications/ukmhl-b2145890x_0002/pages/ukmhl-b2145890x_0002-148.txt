! 30 HEAD AND NECK. the sterno-mastoid, a short distance above its sternal origin. It crosses the space very obliquely, running upwards and forwards to the body of the hyoid bone. The digastric, as its name implies, is a two-bellied muscle. The posterior belly comes out from under cover of the sterno-mastoid, close to the mastoid process and behind the lower part of the parotid gland. It proceeds downwards and forwards to the hyoid bone, and there the intermediate tendon is developed. The anterior belly is directed upwards and forwards to the symphysis of the lower jaw. The intermediate tendon is bound down to the hyoid by a process of deep fascia, and in cleaning the muscle care must be taken not to detach this. The stylo- hyoid muscle lies in relation to the upper border of the posterior belly of the digastric, and is pierced by the digastric tendon at the hyoid bone. Distinctive terms are applied to the three subsidiary triangles which are thus mapped out within the area of the anterior triangular space. The lowest is termed the lower ox muscular triangle; the intermediate triangle receives the name of carotid, whilst the highest is called the sub-maxillary or digastric triangle (Fig. 20). The muscular triangle is bounded in front by the middle line of the neck, and behind by the sterno- mastoid. Its base is above, and formed by the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid, whilst its apex is below at the upper margin of the sternum. The carotid triangle is limited above by the posterior belly of the digastric, and below by the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid. Its base is directed backwards and formed

THE THYROID BODY. 189 also by the sterno-thyroid, sterno-hyoid, and omo- hyoid muscles. It is further overlapped by the sterno- mastoid muscle (Fig. 26, p. 178). Its deep surface is adapted to the parts upon which it liesâ€”viz., to the side of the trachea, the cricoid cartilage, and the thyroid cartilage, whilst its posterior border extends backwards so as to touch the oesophagus and pharynx, and over- lap the common carotid artery. The isthmus of the thyroid body has already been observed in the dissection of the middle line of the neck. It is a narrow band of varying dimensions which lies in front of the second, third, and fourth rings of the trachea, and unites the bases or lower ends of the two lateral lobes. A still further lobe is frequently found in connec- tion with the thyroid body. This is the pyramid or the middle lobe. When present it assumes the form of an elongated slender process which springs from the isthmus on one or other side of the mesial plane (more usually on the left side), and extends upwards towards the hyoid bone. To this it may be connected by fibrous tissue, or perhaps by a narrow slip com- posed of muscular fibres, which receives the name of levator glandidce thyroidece. In some cases this little muscle has an attachment to the thyroid body independently of the pyramidal process. The thyroid body is firmly connected to the parts upon which it lies, and therefore follows the larynx in all its move- ments. The dissector will not fail to be struck with the great vascu- larity of the thyroid body. Four large arteries, and occasion-

294 HEAD AND NECK. ends by dividing into the internal laryngeal and external laryngeal nerves ; both of these have been previously seen .in the dissection of the anterior triangle (pp. 133 and 135)- Before it divides, the superior laryngeal effects communications by means of fine twigs with the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and it also receives one or two filaments from the pharyngeal plexus. The internal laryngeal nerve runs forwards to the interval between the hyoid bone and the thyroid cartilage, and, disappearing under cover of the poste- rior border of the thyro-hyoid muscle, it pierces the membrane of the same name, and enters the larynx. The external laryngeal nerve is a very slender branch, which inclines downwards and forwards to reach the crico-thyroid muscle in which it ends. It supplies a few filaments to the inferior constrictor of the pharynx and a fine twig to the cardiac plexus, whilst it receives a communicating branch from the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. The Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve arises differ- ently on the two sides. On the right side it springs from the vagus as it crosses the first part of the sub- clavian artery, and it adopts its recurrent course by hooking round this vessel. On the left side it arises in the thorax, and hooks round the transverse part of the aortic arch (or, more correctly speaking, around the termination of the obliterated ductus arteriosus). In the neck each nerve ascends in the groove between the trachea and oesophagus, and passing

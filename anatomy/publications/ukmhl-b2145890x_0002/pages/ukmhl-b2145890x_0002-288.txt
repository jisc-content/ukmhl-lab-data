27O HEAD AND NECK. The duct of the submaxillary gland is termed Wharton's duct. It emerges from the main part of the gland and with the deep prolongation of gland substance it proceeds forwards upon the hyo-glossus muscle between the lingual nerve above and the hypoglossal nerve below. Reaching the surface of the genio-hyo-glossus, it inclines slightly upwards and is crossed by the lingual nerve. Finally, it passes under cover of the sublingual gland, and gains the floor of the mouth. Here it opens by a small orifice placed on the summit of a papilla which lies close to the side of the frcenum linguae. The wall of Wharton's duct is much thinner than that of the parotid duct, and consequently, if a small opening be made in it the dissector will experience little difficulty in passing a fine probe or bristle along it into the mouth. Sublingual Gland.â€”The sublingual gland is the smallest of the three salivary glands. It has an elongated shape, and in length it measures about one inch and a-half. Its relations are very definite. Above, it is related to the forepart of the floor of the mouth, being separated from the cavity by the mucous membrane alone. Internally it rests upon the genio-hyo-glossus muscle, whilst, externally it is lodged in a fossa on the deep aspect of the lower jaw, immediately external to the symphysis. Below, it is supported by the mylo-hyoid muscle. Its anterior extremity reaches the mesial plane above the anterior border of the genio-hyo-glossus and is in contact with

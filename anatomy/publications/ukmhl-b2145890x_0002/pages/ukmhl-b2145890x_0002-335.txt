PERIOSTEUM. 3 T7 the upper boundary of the sphenoidal fissure, should next be removed by the bone-pliers, but the dissector must carefully preserve intact the ring of bone around the optic foramen. The sphenoidal fissure is now fully opened up, and the various nerves, as they enter the orbit from the cavernous sinus, may be followed out. Lastly, the anterior clinoid process may be taken away with advantage. Periosteum.—If the above dissection has been successfully carried out, the periosteum clothing the under surface of the orbital roof will be exposed uninjured. The periosteum of the orbit forms a funnel-shaped sheath, which encloses all the contents of the cavity, and is but loosely attached to its bony walls. Behind, it will be observed to be directly continuous with the dura mater, through the sphen- oidal fissure ; whilst, expanding with the cavity, it becomes continuous in front around the orbital opening with the periosteum, which clothes the exterior of the skull. Here also it presents important connections with the palpebral ligaments (p. 232). Parts exposed by the reflection of the Peri- osteum.—The periosteum should be divided along the middle line of the orbit, and also transversely as far forwards as possible. It can now be thrown inwards and outwards. When this is done the lachrymal gland will be exposed in the fore and outer part of the cavity resting upon the upper and outer aspect of the eyeball. Further, the large frontal nerve, lying upon

The two ophthalmic veins receive numerous tributaries during their course through the orbit, and finally they pass between the two heads of the external rectus muscle, and through the sphenoidal fissure to open into the cavernous sinus, either separately or by a common trunk. The Recti Muscles.â€”The four straight muscles of the eyeball converge to the apex of the orbit, and together form the sides of a four-sided or pyramidal space, in which are enclosed the optic nerve and the greater part of the globe of the eye. The rectus superior, which has been reflected, has already been studied. The rectus interims springs from the inner side of the optic foramen, and the rectus inferior takes origin from a fibrous band which bounds the inner extremity of the sphenoidal fissure. The rectus externus is distinguished from the others by arising from a fibrous arch, the extremities of which are termed its two heads of origin. The lower head arises partly in common with the rectus inferior, and partly from a prominent spine of bone on the great wing of the sphenoid, where it forms the lower boundary of the sphenoidal fissure* ; the upper head is attached above the fissure upon the outer side of the optic foramen * It frequently happens that the lower extremity of this fibrous arch has no connection with the spine on the lower margin of the sphen- oidal fissure. In such cases it is merely attached to the body of the sphenoid where this bounds the inner end of the fissure.

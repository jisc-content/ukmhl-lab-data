It)2 HEAD AND NECK. Sterno-Clavicular Articulation.—The dissector must now examine the sterno-clavicular joint, as the next step consists in the disarticulation of the clavicle and the reflection of the clavicular origin of the sterno-mastoid. The structures which hold the two bones in position at this joint are the following :— j Anterior sterno-clavicular. Ligaments proper, j Posterior sterno-clavicular. ( Inter-clavicular. Accessory ligaments, j cost0-Clavicular or rhomboid. Inter-articular fibro-cartilage. To expose these ligaments, the origin of the pecto- ralis major, from the clavicle and the manubrium sterni, must be removed. The sternal origin of the sterno-mastoid is also, to a certain extent, in the way, but it is not advisable to divide this. Sterno - Clavicular Ligaments. — These are placed one in front and the other behind the joint, but they are not isolated sharply-defined bands. Above, they are united by their margins with the Inter-clavicular ligament, whilst below they run into each other so as to constitute in this manner a capsule for the joint. The anterior sterno-clavicular ligament springs from the front of the inner end of the clavicle, and proceeds obliquely downwards and inwards to gain attachment to the anterior aspect of the manubrium sterni. The posterior sterno-clavicular ligament has a corresponding position, and presents similar attachments on the posterior aspect of the

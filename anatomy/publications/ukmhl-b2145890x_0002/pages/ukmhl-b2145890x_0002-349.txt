THE OPHTHALMIC VEINS. 331 ethmoidal artery supplies the mucous lining of the posterior ethmoidal cells, and likewise sends twigs to the upper part of the nose. The ayiterior ethmoidal artery is a larger branch. It runs in company with the nasal nerve proper, and gives off minute twigs at each stage of its course. Thus in the anterior internal orbital canal it gives branches to the mucous lining of the anterior ethmoidal cells and the frontal sinus ; during its sojourn in the cranial cavity it supplies the small anterior meningeal arteries (p. 39) ; in the nasal cavity it gives twigs to the mucous membrane ; whilst its terminal branch appears on the face to supply parts on the side of the nose. The palpebral branches came off near the orbital opening, and are two in number—one for the upper and the other for the lower eyelid (p. 234). The nasal branch is distributed at the root of the nose, and anastomoses with the angular branch of the facial artery. The frontal artery accompanies the supra-trochlear nerve to the forehead, where it has already been dissected (p. 10). The Ophthalmic Veins.—As a general rule these are two in number—superior and inferior. The superior ophthalmic vein is the larger of the two, and it accompanies the artery across the optic nerve. It takes origin at the root of the nose, where it com- municates by a wide radicle with the angular vein. The inferior, ophthalmic vein lies deeper, below the level of the optic nerve, and it is brought into com-

HEAD AND NECK. ally a fifth smaller vessel, convey blood to its substance. The two superior thyroid branches of the external carotid arteries enter the apex and anterior surface of each lateral lobe, and send a branch inwards, along the upper border of the isthmus ; the two inferior thyroid branches of the subclavian arteries distribute their terminal branches to the basal portion and deep surface of each lateral lobe. The occasional artery is the thyroidea ima, a branch of the innominate (more rarely of the common carotid or the aortic arch), which ascends upon the anterior aspect of the trachea to reach the isthmus of the thyroid body. These thyroid arteries anastomose very freely with each other. The veins which drain the blood away from the thyroid body are still more numerous. They arise in part by tributaries which spring from a venous network on the anterior face of the structure, but chiefly by branches which emerge from its sub- stance. They are three in number on each sideâ€”viz., the superior thyroid, the middle thyroid, and the inferior thyroid. The superior and middle thyroid veins cross the carotid sheath and join the internal jugular; the inferior thyroid with its fellow of the opposite side descends in front of the trachea, and as a rule they unite at the root of the neck and open into the left innominate. When the student reflects upon these vascular connections of the thyroid body, he will readily appreciate the gravity of any operation which is undertaken for its removal in cases where it is diseased. The Trachea and the CEsophagus in the cervical portion of their course may now be studied. Both begin at the level of the cricoid cartilage, in front of the sixth cervical vertebra. From this point they extend downwards in front of the vertebral column to the thoracic cavity. The trachea, or windpipe, is a wide tube which is kept constantly patent by the cartilaginous rings embedded in its walls. These rings do not form

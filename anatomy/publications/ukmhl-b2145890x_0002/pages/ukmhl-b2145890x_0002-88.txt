j2 HEAD AND NECK. mediate layer is called the multifidus spina; whilst the deep stratum is composed of a series of short muscles termed the rotatores spines. In the dorsal region alone do we find all three layers ; in the cervical region two layers exist—viz., the semi-spinalis and multifidus ; in the lumbar and sacral regions the multifidus alone is present. Semi-spinalis Muscle.—This muscle is already in great part exposed. To display it fully, however, it is necessary to remove the spinalis dorsi muscle. It is described in two parts—the semi-spinalis dorsi and semi-spinalis colli. The semi-spinalis dorsi is composed of a series of muscular slips arising from the transverse processes of five of the lower dorsal vertebrae (viz., from the sixth to the tenth). It is inserted into the spines of the upper four dorsal and lower two cervical vertebrae. The semi-spinalis colli lies under cover of the corn- plexus. It springs from the transverse processes of the upper five dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the spines of four cervical vertebrae (viz., from the second to the fifth). The Multifidus Spinse is of great extent. Be- ginning in the sacral region, it passes upwards as far as the axis vertebra. It is weakly developed in the dorsal region, but is strongly marked in the loins and in the neck—more especially in the former. To bring it thoroughly into view, the semi-spinalis muscle must be detached from the spines and thrown out- wards; the erector spinae muscle must also be

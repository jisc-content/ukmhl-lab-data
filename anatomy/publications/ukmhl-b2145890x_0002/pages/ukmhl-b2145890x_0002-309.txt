291 VAGUS OR PNEUMOGASTRIC. supply—(1.) to the mucous membrane of the tympanum ; (2.) to the lining membrane of the mastoid cells (Fig. 34, p, o); and (3.) to the mucous membrane of the Eustachian tube (Fig. 34, f). It also gives off in the same part of its course branches which take part in the formation of the tympanic plexus (Fig. 34, r), and two which join the sympathetic plexus on the internal carotid artery. Of the latter, one leaves the tympanum by an aperture in its anterior wall (Fig. 34, h), whilst the other, termed the small deep petrosal nerve (n. petrosus prof, minor) (Fig. 34, g), enters a canal in the processus cochleariformis which conducts it to the foramen lacerum medium, where it effects its junction with the carotid plexus. Vagus or Pneumogastric.—The vagus is the largest of the three divisions of the eighth cranial nerve, and it passes through the middle compartment of the jugular foramen iri company with the spinal accessory—both being included within the same sheath of dura mater. In the neck it pursues a vertical course, lying, in the first instance, between the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery, and afterwards between the same vein and the common carotid artery. Further, as has been already observed, it is inclosed within the sheath which en- velops these vessels, and it lies upon a plane posterior to them. At the root of the neck it enters the thorax, and shows different relations on the two sides. On the right side it crosses the first part of the subclavian artery ; on the left side it proceeds downwards between the common carotid and left subclavian arteries, and passes under cover of the left innominate vein. As in the case of the glosso-pharyngeal, the vagus shows two ganglia in connection with its upper part. These are the ganglion of the root {ganglion

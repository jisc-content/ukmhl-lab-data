,22 HEAD AND NECK. (vertical-transverse) saw-eut on a plane immediately behind the stylomastoid foramen. When th.s has penetrated the bone as far as that foramen a second saw-cut should be made in the sagittal (antero- posterior and vertical) direction, to meet the extremity of the first. The piece of bone thus marked out may now be detached, and a little work -with the chisel will display the facial nerve in this part of the canal. Three branches are given off from it here -viz the nerve to the stapedius, the chorda tympam, and the communicating branch or branches to the auricular nerve from the vagus. The last ortta>£. probably destroyed by the dissection, but the other two can be brought into view by gently ra.smg the nerve from the anterior wall of the canal. By using the chisel in front, and to the inner s.de of the geniculate ganglion, the cochlea will be exposed. ■ Intrapetrous Portion of the Facial Nerve- As the facial nerve traverses the petrous bone, .t may be divided into four stages, which differ from each other in the relations they present and in the direction which they take. They are :— ,. A part within the internal auditory meatus. 2 A very short part which extends from the bottom of the internal auditory foramen to the geniculate ganglion. , A part which occupies that portion of the aque- duct of Fallopius which runs along the inner wril of the tympanum.

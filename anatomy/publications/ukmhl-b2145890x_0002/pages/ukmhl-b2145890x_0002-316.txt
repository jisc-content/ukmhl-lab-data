298 HEAD AND NECK. The vascular twigs are some fine filaments, which are said to be supplied to the deep aspect of the internal jugular vein. Sympathetic Cord in the Neck.â€”The number of ganglia which are developed upon the sympathetic cord in the neck is reduced to three ; but inasmuch as the superior cervical ganglion is brought into connec- tion with the four upper cervical nerves, there is good reason to suppose that it is formed by the coales- cence of four ganglia; upon similar grounds we may argue that the middle and inferior cervical ganglia are each formed by the amalgamation of two primitive ganglia. In the dissection of the neck the greater part of the cervical sympathetic, with the branches which proceed from it, has been displayed. The inferior ganglion, which lies deeply in the hollow between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib, is still to a certain extent concealed, and must now be displayed. Dislodge the subclavian artery from its place on the first rib behind the scalenus anticus muscle, and turn it well inwards. To do this efficiently, it will be necessary to cut the superior intercostal artery at its origin; this vessel runs downwards upon the outer side of the sympa- thetic. Great care must be taken to preserve uninjured the fine nerves which proceed downwards in front of the first part of the subclavian artery. If more space for the dissection is required, the fore part of the first rib may be removed by the bone- pliers, but as a general rule this will not be found to be necessary.

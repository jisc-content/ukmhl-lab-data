INTERIOR OF THE LARYNX. 427 below the hyoid bone and tongue, whilst inferiorly it is directly continuous with the trachea. In front it is covered by the integument and deep cervical fascia, and on either side of the mesial plane by two thin strata of muscles—viz., the sterno-hyoid, the omo-hyoid, the sterno-thyroid and the thyro- hyoid. As a general rule a narrow process of the thyroid body, termed the central lobe, is also continued upwards on its anterior surface. On each side the lateral lobe of the thyroid body is prolonged upwards upon it, and it is related to the great vessels of the neck. Posteriorly it is in relation to the pharynx ; by this it is separated from the prevertebral muscles. If we consider the tip of the epiglottis to represent its upper limit, the larynx in the adult may be regarded as being placed in front of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae ; but its position alters some- what with the movements of the head and also during deglutition. Interior of the Larynx.—The cavity of the larynx is smaller than might be expected from an inspection of its exterior. On looking into its interior from above it will be seen to be subdivided into three portions by two elevated folds of mucous membrane which extend from before backwards, and project inwards from each side of the cavity. The upper pair of folds are termed the false vocal cords ; the lower pair receive the name of the true vocal cords because they are the chief agents in the production of the voice. The entire larynx is in a great measure

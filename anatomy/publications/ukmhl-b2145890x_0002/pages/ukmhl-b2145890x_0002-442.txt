424 HEAD AND NECK. (i.) The great superficial petrosal nerve, from (2.) Communicating twig to tympanic ( geniculate branch of the glosso-pharnygeal, f gangiion. (3.) External superficial petrosal nerve, ) (4.) Nerve to stapedius. (5.) Chorda tympani. (6.) Communicating twigs to the auricular branch of vagus. The great superficial petrosal nerve has already been examined (p. 313). I* origin from the geniculate ganglion of the facial can now be estab- lished by breaking through the roof of the hiatus Fallopii with the chisel. The communicating branch to the tympanic nerve arises from the geniculate ganglion and its union with the tympanic forms the small superficial petrosal nerve (p. 290, Fig. 34)- The external superficial petrosal nerve is not always present. It joins the sympathetic plexus which accompanies the middle meningeal artery (p. 3H)- The nerve to the stapedius muscle arises from the facial as it arches downwards behind the pyramid. It enters the base of the pyramid and thus reaches the stapedius muscle. The communicating twigs to the auricular branch of the vagus arise a short distance above the stylo- mastoid foramen (p. 292). The chorda tympani is the largest branch which is -iven off by the facial during its passage through the aqueduct of Fallopius. It takes origin a short distance above the stylo-mastoid foramen, and arch-

264 HEAD AND NECK. SUBMAXILLARY REGION. The superficial area of the submaxillary region has already been dissected, under the name of the anterior part of the digastric or submaxillary triangle (p. 139). It is now necessary to carry the dissection to a deeper plane, in order to expose a number of parts in connec- tion with the tongue and floor of the mouth. The structures thus displayed are :â€” (1.) Mylohyoid muscle. (2.) Submaxillary gland and its duct. (3.) Sublingual gland. (4.) Side of the tongue, and the mucous membrane of the mouth. Hyo-glossus. Stylo-glossus. Genio-hyoid. Genio-hyo-glossus. < Hypoglossal. (6.) Nerves, . < Lingual. I Glossopharyngeal. (7.) Submaxillary ganglion. (8.) Lingual artery and veins. (9.) Stylo-hyoid ligament. To prepare the part for dissection, it is necessary to throw back the head to its full extent, and turn it slightly to the opposite side. If the stuffing in the mouth has not been previously removed in the dissec- tion of the pterygo-maxillary region, it should be taken out now, and then the tip of the tongue should be seized with the forceps, and drawn forcibly forwards (5.)

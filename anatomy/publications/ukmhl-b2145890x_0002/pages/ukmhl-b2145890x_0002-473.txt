ARYTENOID CARTILAGES. 455 ages the dissector should examine the cartilages of Santorini and the manner in which they are held in position. They are two minute pyramidal nodules of yellow elastic cartilage which are placed on the summits of the arytenoid cartilages and are directed backwards and inwards. Each cartilage of Santorini is enclosed within the corresponding aryteno-epiglot- tidean fold of mucous membrane, and is joined to the apex of the arytenoid cartilage by a joint which Facet for thyroid cartilage.

The tips of the two cornicula laryngis are connected to the upper border of the posterior lamina of the cricoid cartilage by a Y - shaped ligament termed the ligamentum jugale. Arytenoid Cartilages—In dealing with the aryte- noid cartilages it is well to remove one in order that its external form may be studied ; the other should

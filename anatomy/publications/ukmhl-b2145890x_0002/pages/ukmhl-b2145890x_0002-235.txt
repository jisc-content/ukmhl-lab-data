NERVES OF THE FACE. 217 In its course through the gland it crosses the pos- terior auricular artery and gives off three branches â€”viz., the posterior auricular nerve, the nerve to the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, and the nerve to the stylo-hyoid muscle. The posterior auricular nerve has already been followed out in its distribution to the retrahens aurem, attollens aurem, and posterior belly of the occipito- frontalis (p. 9). Its origin is now exposed, and it will be seen to arise from the facial trunk immediately after this issues from the stylo-mastoid foramen. Further, at this stage it may be possible to make out a communication between the auricular branch of the pneumo-gastric * (Arnold's nerve) and the posterior auricular. The nerve to the posterior belly of the digastric is a stout, short branch which inclines downwards and forwards and soon divides into several filaments which enter the upper surface of this muscle. One of these twigs usually passes through the muscle to effect a communication with the glosso-pharyngeal close to the base of the skull. The nerve to the stylo-hyoid is a longer and more slender filament, which generally arises in common with the preceding, and sinks into the posterior aspect of this muscle. The temporo-facial division of the facial is pro- * Arnold's nerve emerges from the interval between the mastoid pro- cess and the auditory meatus, and after sending a branch to join the posterior auricular nerve, it ends in filaments for the integument on the posterior aspect of the ear.

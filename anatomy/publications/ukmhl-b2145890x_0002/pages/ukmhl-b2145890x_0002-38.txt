It will be readily recognised from its ascending from the spinal canal into the cranial cavity, through the foramen magnum. It is only necessary now for the dissector to thrust the knife into the spinal canal, and divide the vertebral arteries as they turn forwards upon the upper part of the spinal cord, and then sever at a lower level the spinal cord, the spinal accessory nerve of the left side, and the roots of the first pair of spinal nerves. By letting the head fall well backwards, and gently dislodging the medulla and cerebellum, the whole brain can be removed. The veins of Galen, as they pass from the interior of the brain to enter the straight sinus, are ruptured by this proceeding. In order that the brain may be studied to best advantage, it is necessary that it should be subjected to some hardenmg e-agenl'.

Upon either side the dissector will notice the series of apertures of exit for the roots of the spinal nerves. These are ranged in pairs opposite each intervertebral foramen, and the subdural space is prolonged outwards for a short distance upon the nerve-roots. Arachnoid Mater—Fig. 13 («).—The arachnoid resembles the dura mater in forming a loose, wide S.p d Fig. 13.

The sac which it forms is most capacious towards its lower part, where it envelopes the extremity of the cord and the collection of long nerve-roots which constitute the cauda equina. Here it can be most

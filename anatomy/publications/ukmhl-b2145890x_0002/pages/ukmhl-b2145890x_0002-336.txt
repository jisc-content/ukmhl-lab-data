3i8 HEAD AND NECK. the upper surface of the levator palpebral superioris, will be seen stretching forwards in the middle line of the orbit; as it approaches the fore part of the cavity, it is joined by the supra-orbital artery. The other superficial structures are usually more or less obscured by the soft pliable fat, which everywhere fills up the interstices between the different orbital contents. On carefully separating this, along the inner wall of the orbit, the superior oblique muscle will be more fully displayed, and lying upon and entering the hinder part of this muscle, the small fourth nerve will be discovered. As a general rule the dissector fails to find this nerve, because he looks for it too far forwards. Lastly, the lachrymal nerve and artery will be found running along the outer wall of the orbit, above the level of the upper margin of the external rectus muscle. These structures must be thoroughly cleaned and isolated by the removal of the fat from around them. In tracing the superior oblique muscle forwards, it will be found to end in a slender tendon, which passes through a ring-like pulley, attached to the frontal bone at the inner angle of the orbit. This pulley must be defined, and the tendon of the muscle followed onwards to its insertion into the eyeball. It will be observed that the levator palpebral superioris lies upon the upper surface of the superior rectus, and if it be raised, a nerve twig will be noticed, emerging from the substance of the rectus superior for the supply of the levator palpebral muscle. This is a branch of the superficial division of the third nerve.

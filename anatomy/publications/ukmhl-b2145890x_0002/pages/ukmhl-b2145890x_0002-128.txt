II0 HEAD AND NECK. thyroid muscles, and is fixed below to the posterior border of the manubrium sterni. Upon either side the two layers unite beyond the sternal head of origin of the sterno-mastoid, and the space between them contains (i.) a little areolo-fatty tissue ; (2.) the two anterior jugular veins for a very short part of their course; (3.) the cross branch of communication between the anterior jugular veins of opposite sides when this exists ; (4.) sometimes a lymphatic gland ; and (5.) the sternal heads of the sterno-mastoid muscles. Open into the space by dividing the anterior layer close to the sternum, and gauge its extent by means of the handle of the knife. The processes and partitions which proceed from the deep surface of the cervical fascia cannot in every case be displayed at the present stage of the dissection, but it is necessary that they should be described, in order that the student may be able to recognise them and appreciate their bearings as they are unfolded in the subsequent dissection of the neck. Those requiring special notice are :â€” (1.) The pre-tracheal fascia. (2.) The pre-vertebral fascia. (3.) The carotid sheath. (4.) The stylo-maxillary ligament. The pre-tracheal fascia is a partition, of no great strength, which springs from the deep aspect of the lamella clothing the deep surface of the sterno- mastoid. It passes right across the neck in front of the thyroid body and trachea, and behind the anterior

87 I. FRONT AND INNER SIDE OF THIGH. For the dissection of the parts concerned in femoral hernia, see page 108. These parts, with the small upper branches of the femoral artery & internal saphenous vein and the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve, should be dissected before the dissection of Scarpa's triangle proper is begun. A vertical incision should now be made through the skin over the anterior & inner aspect of the thigh down to about four inches below the knee. This long vertical incision is preferable to the shorter vertical incision, combined with a transverse incision at its lower part, generally recommended. It endangers no cutaneous nerves, as transverse incisions do, and allows the dissector to free the whole length of the sartorius mtiscle in the early stages of the dissectionâ€”a step that will greatly facilitate the subsequent work. In no part of the body can careful planning and thoroughness of work do more to make a difficult dissection relatively easy than in Scarpa's triangle and the front & inner side of the thigh. In this dissection a double difficulty centres in the anterior crural & external cutaneous nerves. (1.) The latter nerve and the cutaneous branches of the former have, at least in the usual way of dissecting the front of the thigh, to be found in the superficial fascia. (2.) The deeper structures are railed off, so to speak, by a radiating pencil of muscular and cutaneous nerves, by which the deep dissection is everywhere greatly impeded. As regards the anterior crural' nerve, let the dissector get, to begin with, upon the undivided trunk immediately below

100 to iu connection with the dit^section of the palm of the hand. Even this little trial is lighter in this case than in the case of the hand: the digital nerves are shorter, and it is somewhat less necessary to get out all the digital arteries. It is as imperative, howe ver, as in the case of the hand, that all the digital nerves be dissected. The first tiling to do in dissecting the sole of the foot is to make an incision along the middle line straight down to the I)lantar fascia. This incision should be begun on the os caleis, to which the fascia is attached posteriorly, and which will indi- cate the depth at which the fascia is to be found. If the knife is entered anteriorly, there is danger of the fascia being cut through, and the subjacent muscles damaged. The fascia should now be cleaned forwards till it is seen, about an inch behind the metatarso-phalangeal articulations, to divide into the slips to the toes. Between these slips, and corresponding to the intervals between the toes, the subcutaneous fat changes character. From being dense, hard, & granular, it suddenly becomes quite soft; and, from having been previously bound down by the undissected fascia, it comes, as soon as this is removed, to project in, so to speak, four soft cushions. It is beneath these cushions that the dividing trunks of the digital nerves will be found, accompanied by the digital arteries, which lie a little deeper. If good work is to be done—i.e., if the deeper parts of the sole of the foot are to be adequately dissected—the dissector must now trace the digital nerves on the sides of each digit at least as far as the middle of the second phalanges, and he must tlioroughly lift them up.* As the plantar arch is not a super- ficial structure standing in the way of other parts, it is less * This shonld be done as indicated in reference to the nerves of the fingers page G5.

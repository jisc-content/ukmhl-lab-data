50 Grasserian ganglion, &c. Fiftli nerve traced forwards in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, but 7iot at first lifted iip or cleaned on its tinder snrfaee. Origin of lachrymal nerve. Trace third nerve forwards in outer wall of cavernous sinus. Where it approaches the fifth nerve in the vicinity of the anterior clinoid process, carefully lift tip the latter nerve and push it outwards. Make out the upper and lower divisions of the third nerve, and the nasal branch of the ophthalmic as it passes forwards and inwards between them. Sixth nerve in cavernous sinus. Thefe is no diflBculty whatever in cleaning the sixth nerve, as it lies in the floor of the cavernous sinus, and in tracing it to the inner surface of the external rectus muscle. MIDDLE AND DEEP DISSECTIONS OF THE ORBIT. If the part is to be kept as a Superficial Dissection of the orbit, it will be damaged by the dissection being taken any further than above described, except that the upper division of the third nerve may be traced into the levator palpebrse superioris & superior rectus. The superficial dissection may now be transformed either into a dissection from the outer side, or into a middle dissection. To make a Middle Dissection of the orbit, divide the frontal & lachrymal nerves, and the levator palpebrce superioris, superior

95 it from the dense fascia which covers the upper part of the gkiteus medius ; this fascia should be preserved ; it lies beneath a thick mass of fat filling up the hollow below the front part of the iliac crest. Dissect underneath the gluteus maximus, starting from both its upper and lower edges, and divide the muscle towards its middle. Dissect the muscle from off the great sacro-sciatic ligament, and thus clearly define the great sacro-sciatic foramen; this greatly facilitates the subsequent course of the dissection. Define the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen, and the muscular intervals above & below the obturator internus & gemelli, separating these, on the one hand, from the glutei medius & minimus, and, on the other, from the quadratus femoris. Be careful of the small gemellus superior, which arises from the spine of the ischium. Separate with much care the gemelli from the obturator internus. If the interior of the pelvis can be got at, it will greatly facilitate the deep dissection of the gluteal region to find the gluteal artery and superior gluteal nerve inside the pelvis, and to trace them outwards through the upper part of the great sacro-sciatic foramen. The nerve arises from the back of the lumbo- sacral cord behind the internal iliac artery and vein; be specially mindful of its superior branch, which is frequently lost in the course of the dissection. The internal iliac and gluteal veins are much in the way, and should be removed while the artery and nerve are being traced out. Separate with care the anterior border of the gluteus medius

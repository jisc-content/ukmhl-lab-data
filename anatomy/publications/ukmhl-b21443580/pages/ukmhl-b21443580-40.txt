3G of the orbit has been completed. Sever the palpebral ligament, and turn the eyelids over upon the nose. The muscle, with its two slips going, the one to the upper lid, the other to lower lid, will be seen on the posterior aspect of the reflected portion of the tendo oculi. By turning up the upper lip, drawing up the nose, and divid- ing the mucous membrane near the frsenum, a small fasciculus will be seen near the middle line ; this is the depressor alse nasi. Internally to the inner fibres of the depressor labii inferioris is the small bundle of fibres of the levator menti. Though lying in very dense cellular tissue, the posterior belly of the occipito-frontalis will easily be made out after the dissec- tion of the back of the neck. It arises from the outer two-thirds of the superior curved line of the occipital bone, and from the mastoid portion of the temporal. The retrahens aurem is a small fasciculus arising from the mastoid process, and easily made tense by drawing the ear forwards. The attrahens and attollens aurem are quite super- ficial, but very faintly marked.

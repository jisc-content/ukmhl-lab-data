10 he specially cares for the " parts concerned in inguinal & femoral hernise " ? Ko; it is exceptional for these to be got out at all satisfactorily. It is submitted that it is the more or less complex felting of the striiettires that constitutes the difference between the several parts of the body from the dissector's point of view. Towards the middle and greater part of the limbs, the structures run more or less parallel to each other, there is no felting to speak of, and the dissection is relatively easy. We have much the same thing towards the middle of the anterior triangle of the neck, where, however, the leading structures (principal arteries & veins) may more appropriately be said to radiate somewhat from a centre. But the arrangement is essentially different towards the root of the limbs (axilla, Scarpa's triangle, gluteal region) ; towards the extremities (palm of the hand, sole of the foot, dorsum of the foot) ; towards the upper pai't of the anterior triangle (parotid region); and towards the lower part (root of the neck). Here complex felting prevails; and here it is that the dissection is less easy, or, rather, more impeded. Why is it that "parts" nicely begun, and promising well at first, are, after many delays, so often left unfinished? Is it simply that the dissector tires of his work ? There is a deeper reason than that. It is a question of felting. There is necessarily no felting in the superficial structures, even where there is in the deeper ones, and these are consequently always easy to clean. It is the deeper structures which, in certain regions, are felted. Here it is that the untrained dissector breaks down.

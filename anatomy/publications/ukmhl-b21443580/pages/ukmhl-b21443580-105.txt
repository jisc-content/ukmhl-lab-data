101 important than in the case of the hand, to dissect all the digital arteries. The dissector must now find the lumbricalis muscle on the inner side of each digit, beneath the corresponding nerve, and must clean and lift every one of these four small muscles. Finally, he must open up the five tendinous sheaths, and turn out all the short and long flexor tendons. If all this be not thoroughly done, it will be impossible, later on, to properly turn down the superficial muscles, so as to get at the deeper structures. The dissector should now remove the plantar fascia, and clean . the superficial layer of muscles, opening up the intervals on either side of the flexor brevis, so as to trace the plantar vessels & nerves from the back part of the foot. Much care should be bestowed, in the interval between the flexor brevis & the abductor pollicis, upon the internal plantar artery, which is often quite small, and easily damaged. The three superficial muscles should now be lifted up as far back as their origin from the os calcis, care being taken not to damage the subjacent vessels & nerves, and a saw should be passed beneath them so as to detach the portion of bone from which they arise. ' The first layer of muscles being now turned down, the muscles of the second layer can be sufiiciently relaxed (by

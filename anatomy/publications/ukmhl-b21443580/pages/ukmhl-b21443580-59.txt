55 posterior branch of the sub-occipital nerve entering the triangle, and supplying the three small muscles and the complexus. With a little care, there will be seen the anterior division of the same nerve as it passes forwards on the inner side of the vertebral artery and rectus lateralis muscle, and also the ganglion on its posterior root.* The ganglion on the posterior root of the second cervical nerve is as large as a small pea, and cannot be missed if properly looked for. The scaleni muscles and the deep muscles of the front of the neck are left attached when the section of the pharynx is made. These can now be cleaned. VIII. PHARYNX AND SOFT PALATE. The section of the pharynx {quod vide) to be made after the dissection cf the triangles of the neck, face, pterygo- and sub-maxillary regions, f (The orbit & sub-occipital region can be dissected either before or after the section.) If a good pharynx is to be obtained, special attention must have been paid, in dissecting the face, to the orbiciilaris oris & buccinator, and, in dissecting th6 deeper parts of the neck, to the stylo-glossus & -pharyngeus muscles and glosso- * It is a good plan to find the roots of the sub-occipital nerve within the spinal canal as they arise from the upper part of the side of the cord. t If the above dissections are good ones, it seems preferable to preserve them, and to give a fresh "part " for the pharynx and soft palate.

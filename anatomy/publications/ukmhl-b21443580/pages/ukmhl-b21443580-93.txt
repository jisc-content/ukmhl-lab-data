89 The dissector's attention may now be turned first towards the outer, and then towards the inner part of the region. In the OUTER PART OF THE REGION, the sartorius should be dissected quite up to its origin. Then the rectus should be followed up to the anterior inferior spine of the ilium (direct tendon), and freed inferiorlj. This done, the dissector can lift up the foregoing muscles and the outer branches of the anterior crural nerve, and trace the external circumflex artery in the mass of loose cellular tissue in front of the capsule of the hip-joint & neck of the femur. The anterior border of the tensor vaginae femoris being freed, and the thigh being flexed so as to relax the muscles, the dissector can now get at the reflected tendon of the rectus. In the INNER PART OF THE REGION, the Superficial dissec- tion may be distinguished from the deep. As regards the snperfieial dissection, there is no difficulty, now that the branches of the anterior crural nerve, traced each to its termiiiatiojt, can be well drawn out of the way, in following out the femoral artery & vein and the internal or long saphenous nerve in Hunter's canal, and down to the opening in the lower part of the adductor magnus,â€”opposite

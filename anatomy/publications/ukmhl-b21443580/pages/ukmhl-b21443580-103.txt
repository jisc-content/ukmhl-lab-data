99 V. BACK OF LEG. External or short saphenous vein; communicantes tibialis & tibnlaris, & external or short saphenous nerve. Divide heads of gastrocnemius, and cut away soleus from its origins, leaving part of each of these and the fibrous arch between tibia & fibnla. To do this, make two vertical cuts through the muscle, the one half an inch internal to the posterior surface of the fibula, and the other half an inch external to the inner border of the tibia. Then join these by an arched incision, concave inferiorly, running half an inch below the oblique line of the tibia and the fibrous arch between the tibia tSs fibula, beneath which pass the posterior tibial vessels & nerves,â€”thus leaving this arch in situ. In dissecting the deep muscles of the back of the leg, it should be noticed that both the flexor longus digitorum and the flexor proprius pollicis overlap the tibialis posticus to a considerable extent. Parts behind inner ankle. From within outwards, - tendons of tibialis posticus & flexor longus digitorum, posterior tibial artery with a vein on either side, posterior tibial nerve, tendon of flexor longus pollicis. VI. SOLE OF THE FOOT. This much-neglected region, generally considered very difficult, is really quite easy to dissect, if only the dissector will stand the slight trial to his patience involved in the ten-fold dissection of the digital arteries & nerves already referred

115 standpoint. Unfortunately they are much neglected by the dissector, for the reason, probably, that the principal structures —those contained within the pelvis—are somewhat difficult to get at. The classical way of getting at these structures is by making a " side view of the pelvis," quod vide. This prelimiuaiy operation damages, however, the abdomen, and the structure s of the brim of the pelvis on one side ; and, though extremely helpful, it is really not necessary, provided one small practical point be attended to, namely, that of adequately separating the bladder, prostate, and membranous portion of the urethra from the rectum. HOW TO SEPARATE THE BLADDER, PROSTATE, AND MEMBRA- NOUS PORTION OF THE URETHRA FROIM THE RECTUM, - THE PERINEUM HAVING BEEN PREVIOUSLY DISSECTED. Eemove the posterior part of the superficial muscles of the perinceum, and separate the sphincter ani from the central tendinous point. Now with the finger work up your way between the prostate and the rectum, carefully separating these organs, which are joined together by only a little loose cellular tissue. Divide the peritoneum of the recto-vesical pouch, and care- fully separate the bladder from the rectum. If the side view of the pelvis is made, it will still be an essential point to separate early the bladder, prostate, and membranous portion of the urethra from tlie rectum, though iu this case the separation may be effected piecemeal rather than as a preliminary operation. The only structures of the pelvis at all difficult to clean are the vesiculse semiuales, with the adjacent terminal portion

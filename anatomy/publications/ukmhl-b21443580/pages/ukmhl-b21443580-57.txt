53 thetic root, wliich is often blended with the long or sensory root. Of the four dissections of the orbit, the only one at all difficult is the superficial dissection from above; the others are quite easy. When, therefore, a dissector has got a good superficial dissection of the orbit from above, he is strongly recommended not to hastily transform it either into a middle dissection, or into a dissection from the outer side. Neither should a middle dissection be inconsiderately transformed into a deep one. Students co-operating a little in the matter of orbits, there will always be previous external and deep dissections, and probably some middle dissections, whose authors, B., C, & D., will be glad to study the superficial dissection of A., while A. can benefit by studying their more advanced work belore conducting his own dissection through its final stages. VII. SUB-OCCIPATAL REGION-SCALEXI MUSCLES AND DEEP MUSCLES OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. Tense the trapezius either by flexing the neck, or, better, by forcibly rotating the part so that the face looks over the shoulder of the side being dissected. This can easily be done with the callipers. Tense and clean first one trapezius and then the other. The fascia over the upper part of the trapezius is extremely dense. Be care- ful, therefore, of the thin outer edge of the muscle, which is easily missed. The great occipital nerve pierces the trapezius quite at its upper part, just below its insertion into the superior curved line of the occipital bone, and is not easy to find in the dense fascia referred to. But by relaxing the muscle, and raising its edge, the nerve may be seen beneath ir, piercing the complexus ; and can then easily be traced through the trapezitis and on to the back of the head. Eeflect both trapezii inwards, dividing them transversely on a level with the superior angle of the scapula.

106 beneath the muscle below the tuberosity of the ischium. Trace it to the perinjBuui when the body is in the lithotomy position. To begin the dissection of the sphincter and levator amS coccygeus, and pudic vessels & nerve, open the abdomen in the middle line, fully distend the rectum from above & from below, stitch up the anus, fill the cavity of the pelvis with sponges or any soft material, and raise the pelvis as a whole, not on ordinary blocks, but by means of a cylindrical block just large enough to go into the pelvis (a large jam-pot will do very well as a substitute), which shall depress the tissues of the perinseum as in a "bearing-down" effort. The parts are now prominent and well tensed. An incision round the anus will expose the few radiating fibres which constitute the corrugator cutis ani. Prolonging the incision backwards and forwards, make out the fibres of the sphincter ani as they arise from the tip of the coccyx, and trace them very carefully towards the central tendinous point of the perinseum. The posterior fibres of the levator ani are nearly parallel to those of the sphincter ; its more anterior fibres join those of the sphincter nearly at right angles. Make out the inferior hsemorrhoidal vessels & nerve. Make out the pudic vessels & nerve as they enter the ischio-rectal fossa posteriorly, crossing inferiorly the spine of the ischium, lesser sacro-sciatic ligament, and coccygeus muscle.

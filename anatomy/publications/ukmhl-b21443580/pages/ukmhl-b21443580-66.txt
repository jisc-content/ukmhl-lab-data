.62 tissue of the axilla transversely with forceps & finger-nail. The nerve will be found behind the lower border of the pectoralis major, just where the muscle is leaving the thoracic wall. The nerve should be traced a good long way down the inner and back part of the arm, and its anastomosis made out with the lesser mternal ciitaneoits nerve. If only a small portion of the nerve be cleaned, the dissection of the posterior wall of the axilla will be greatly impeded. There may be two intercosto-humeral nerves. Now clean the lower edge of the latissimus dorsi. This will be the easiest & safest way of getting into the loose cellular tissue of the axilla, to clear away which the dissector should use finger & forceps rather than knife. The lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves may now be sought for and cleaned. First the pectoralis major, and then the pectoralis minor, should now be cleaned, and then divided a short distance from the ribs. To clean the axilla without dividing the pectoral muscles is attempting an unnecessarily difficult task, and one involving a great sacrifice of time. In dividing the muscles, the lower & thinner part of the costo-coracoid membrane will of course be sacrificed, hut the upper and thicker part of the membrane will remain. At the upper part of the axilla it will generally be desirable

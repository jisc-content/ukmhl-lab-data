40 The middle meningeal, by far the largest of the three, may be looked for first, and may be cleaned freely along its outer or superficial aspect; but care is needed in dealing with its posterior and anterior aspects, as from the former there may arise the tympanic artery, and from the latter the small meningeal. The superficial root of the auriculo-temporal nerve generally crosses the middle meningeal artery close to the base of the skull, while its deep root lies beneath the artery; the nerve then runs horizontally backwards towards the temporal artery, crossing the direction of the tympanic artery, which is superficial to it, and of the internal lateral ligament of the jaw and the chorda tympani, which lie beneath it, the ligament being superficial to the chorda. The chorda tympani may be looked for beneath the internal lateral ligament of the jaw and the inferior dental nerve, where it will be seen to join obliquely the posterior aspect of the gustatory nerve. In the writer's experience it lies a good deal higher up than is generally represented in plates. It will be seen from the above that the posterior aspect of the gustatory nerve should be cleaned with care. The dissector has now to get close to the trunk of the inferior maxillary nerve as it leaves the foramen ovale, and to the origin of the two deep temporal, masseteric, pterygoid, and buccal nerves, which arise from its anterior division.

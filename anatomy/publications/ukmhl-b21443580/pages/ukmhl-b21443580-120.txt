116 of the vasa deferentia, and the membranous portion of the urethra. These structures are soft, and easily torn if it is attempted to clean them without the advantage of good and easy access. This advantage is now gained. The rectum, if previously distended, should be temporarily emptied during the cleaning of the organs of the front pai't of the pelvis, unless the side view of the pelvis be made. Find the vasa deferentia as they emerge from the internal abdominal rings, trace them downwards to the base of the bladder (which should be slightly distended with air), and look for the vesiculas seminales, which lie on their outer side. Handle these structures carefully. The ureters are good guides to the posterior extremity of the vesicuke; be careful of these ducts. Kemove the peritoneum from off the back & sides of the bladder, and the abundant loose cellular tissue which surrounds the organ, being careful of the superior vesical arteries and of the urachus. Clean the undivided portion of the pelvic fascia, its recto- vesical layer, the white line, & tlie pubo-prostatic ligaments. Xote the groove between the latter, which contains the dorsal vein of the penis. Separate the rectum from the loose cellular tissue between it and the pyriformis muscle and sacral plexus, and clean

57 When the upper border of the superior constrictor has been reached, remove the mucous membrane and fibrous bag of the pliarjnx, defining the upper border of the superior constrictor and the cranio-pharyngeal ligament, and clean the levator palati muscle. The pharynx being opened in the middle line, and the palato- pharyngeus being tensed by drawing the thyroid cartilage downwards, remove the mucous membrane from off this muscle, carefully defining its two heads of origin and the insertion of the levator palati, which they embrace. A thick stratum of glandular tissue must be removed from off the back of the soft palate and azygos uvulse, which latter must be tensed, while being cleaned, by traction on the uvula. The palato-glossus must be cleaned from within the mouth, the base of the tongue being depressed. The fleshy portion of the tensor palati has already been seen ; the reflection of its tendon will easily be made out.

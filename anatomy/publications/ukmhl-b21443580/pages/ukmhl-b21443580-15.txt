11 Can dissecting be made easy? and how? Some will say to the dissector, Cut away the superficial structures when you have seen them, and thus make the deep ones superficial. The plan is sanctioned by custom. I rebel against it, nevertheless. It deprives the student of what should be pre-eminently his ownâ€”the accumulated products of his past labour. It is now lawful to keep "parts" from one end of the session to the other (six months); they should be kept the full time, undamaged, and be studied over and over again. I never sanction the division of any muscle in the upper limb, except the pectorales major & minor, and sometimes the deltoid; and I require that the outer head of the flexor sublimis digitorum be left undetached. In the lower limb, I only allow the division of the glutei maximus & medius, gastrocnemius, & soleus; and I preserve the arch of the latter. Nevertheless, we dissect down to the bones & ligaments. The plan of removing the superficial structures takes away the dissector's interest in his " part." The intellectual interest to be taken in dissecting lies in so planning the superficial work as to get at the deeper structures to advantage. To be a good dissector, one must be somewhat of a strategist. Practical anatomy is a question of unravelling the feltwork of the human body. The feltwork must not be cut. It is he who under- stands the mesh, who will dissect both well and quickly. Dissecting should be a fascinating pursuit.

90 which opening a small part of the anterior wall of Hunter's canal should be left untouched. As regards the deep dissection, the dissector should now free the gracilis and the adductor muscles from origin to insertion. This will save these muscles, which are very soft, from being torn, and will bring the dissector conveniently upon the profunda artery & its branches, and upon the anterior & posterior divisions of the obturator nerve. Profunda artery traced out behind adductor longus; its perforating branches. Internal circumflex artery traced out between pectineus & psoas. The terminal portion of the artery—that between the quadratus femoris & the adductor magnus—can only be made out in the dissection of the gluteal region. In cleaning the branches of the femoral artery remove all ike veiies cornites; preserving them will, in nine cases out of ten, prevent their being traced to their termination. The femoral, politeal, and internal & external saphenous veins are the only ones that need be preserved in the lower limb. Anterior division of the obturator nerve traced down to its anastomoses with the internal saphenous &j internal cutaneous nerves. Internal or long saphenous nerve perforating lower part of

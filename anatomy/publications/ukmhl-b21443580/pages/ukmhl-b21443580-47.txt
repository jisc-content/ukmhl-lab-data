43 lingual or gustatory nerve crossing the duct, and having the submaxillary ganglion hanging down from it by two or three small filaments. The large posterior part of the submaxillary gland covers the hypoglossal nerve, and the lingual or gustatory nerve with the submaxillary ganglion. As the gland contracts anteriorly, it passes with the duct and the gustatory nerve beneath the sublingual gland. It is in this situation that the gustatory nerve crosses Wharton's duct. It will be seen that the structures the dissector should clean first are the two glands and the duct. These should be turned upwards and forwards; they should not be completely detached, however, but should be left adherent by a strip of mucous membrane to the floor of the mouth. The gustatory nerve may be cleaned freely along its upper border, and so may the hypoglossal nerve along its lower border; but along the upper border of the hypoglossal, the anastomotic loop between the two nerves should be looked for, and along the lower border of the gustatory the same loop should be looked for, with, a little behind it, the submaxillary ganglion. The submaxillary ganglion will generally be found without much difficulty if it is looked for just below the gustatory nerve, beneath the deep portion of the submaxillary gland, and behind the anastomotic loop between the gustatory and the hypoglossal. It hangs down from the gustatory nerve by two or three small nerve filaments.

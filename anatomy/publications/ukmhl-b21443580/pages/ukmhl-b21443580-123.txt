119 SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS TO PROSECTORS. The order of dissection may he somewhat altered with advantage in the case of those who have already dissected the parts more than once, and who are dissecting further with a view, on the one hand, to obtaining a wider range of observation— (Quite irrespectively of abnormalities, subjects differ considerably as regards the density of the several fascite, the size of the arteries, &c.)—and with a view, on the other hand, to preparing parts for the class or for others to study upon. Thus :—' 1. Prosectors of the upper limb may advantageously dissect the forearm and palm of the hand before the axilla and back part of the shoulder, - taking the Sections of the upper limb in the following order:—II., IIL, lY., - I., Y. 2. Similarly, prosectors of the lower limb may advantageously dissect the leg and foot before the thigh, gluteal region, and deeper part of the popliteal space, - taking the Sections of the lower limb in the following order :—11., Y., YI., - I., III., lY. 3. Active prosectors of the head and neck will also do well to take the face (see note referring to facial nerve) and the superficial dissection of the orbit (including the cavernous sinus) before the triangles of the neck. The other regions of the head and neck should be taken in the order in which they are referred to in the Guides. It will be seen that the changes in the order of dissection above suggested amount to taking the more difficult part of the work before the easier part, - or the less familiar before the more familiar.

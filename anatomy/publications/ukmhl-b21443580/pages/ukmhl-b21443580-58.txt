54 Clean on both sides the splenius and the levator anguli scapuljB, and such portion of the complexus as is exposed. The fibres of the two former muscles are oblique upwards & outwards; those of the complexus are vertical. Eemove, on one side, the splenius, levator anguli scapute, parts of the rhomboideus & serratus posticus superior, and the complexus. In the subjacent mass of loose fat, feel for the prominent spinous process of the axis. Towards it there converge from below the upper fibres of the multifidus spinse, and from it there diverge superiorly the inferior oblique and the rectus capitis posticus major. Beneath the latter muscle is the rectus capitis posticus minor. From the outer extremity of the former (transverse process of the axis) the superior oblique passes almost directly upwards. The great occipital nerve will be seen winding round the lower border of the inferior oblique, and crossing the triangle formed by the small posterior cranio-vertebral muscles. "Within the triangle will be seen the vertebral artery running horizontally inwards upon the posterior arch of the atlas. Between the artery & the bone, there will be seen the

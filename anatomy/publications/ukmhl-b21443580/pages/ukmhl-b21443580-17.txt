13 I would direct attention for a moment to the sole of the foot. Have we not all seen, with a kindly pity for him, a poor unfor- tunate dissector first remove the skin of the sole of the foot ao scrupulously as one might remove that over the perinaeum or the parts concerned in inguinal or femoral hernia, and then look, in the dense, hard, granular fat, for the plantar cutaneous nerve, and, after failing to find it—as he almost necessarily would—spend some hours more looking, also fruitlessly perhaps, for the digital nerves ? How.can we best help the deserving fellow? First, we should tell him that the plantar cutaneous nerve should be looked for where it leaves the trunk of the posterior tibial, and then be traced down to the sole of the foot. Then we should show him the way of finding the digital nerves by cutting straight down upon the plantar fascia and exposing the slips to the toes. This is done by first cutting down upon the back part of the under surface of the os calcis, to which the fascia is attached, and which marks the level at which the fascia is found. The dissector can now, in a few minutes, clean the whole of the fascia forwards till, in the vicinity of the metatarso-phalangeal articulations, it is seen to split up into the above-mentioned slips to toes. Between these slips, and corresponding to the intervals between the toes, the fat suddenly changes character. From being dense, hard, and granular, it suddenly becomes quite soft; and, from being IDreviously bound down by the pressure of the undissected fascia, it comes, as soon as this is removed, to project in, so to speak, four soft pads or cushions. It is beneath these latter that the dividing trunks of the digital nerves are found, which, with the digital arteries, which are a little deeper, can now be traced to the toes without hindrance. Here the os calcis has led to the plantar fascia, which, if it had been attempted to cut down upon

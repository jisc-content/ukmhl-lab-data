108 Carefully separate the three superficial muscles of tlie perinseum, and thus expose the inferior layer of the dee]> perinieal fascia, or triangular, ligament. Notice that it is attached to the rami of the pubes & ischium internally to the crus penis. Divide the inferior layer of the deep perinaeal fascia in- ternally to the cms penis and rami of the pubes & ischium, expose the structures contained between its two layers, namely, the compressor urethrte muscle surrounding the membranous portion of the urethra (which should be distended with a soft catheter), the deep transversus perincei (often absent), the pudic vessels & nerve, the vessels & nerve to the bulb, Cowper's glands & their ducts. Clean the erector penis & accelerator m'inae muscles. Notice, by partly removing them from off the crus penis & bulb, how thin they are, and that their apparent bulk is due to their resting upon the subjacent erectile structure. . It will be well to defer cleaning the corpora cavernosa & spongiosum till after the male pelvis is dissected. II. FEMORAL & INGUINAL HERNIiE. The parts concerned in femoral & inguinal hernia) present a superficial stratum, - skin, superficial fascia with its two layers,

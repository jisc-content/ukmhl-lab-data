68 (2) The passage between the middle & outer heads of the flexor subliinis traversed by the ulnar artery. These two passages first unite inferioriy, and then from the common channel thus formed there branch off, (3) Upwards & inwards, the passage between the two heads of the flexor carpi iilnaris, in which lie the npper part of the ulnar nerve & the posterior ulnar recurrent artery ; (4) Backwards, the passage between the upper border of the interosseous membrane and the oblique or round ligament, through which the posterior interosseous artery gets to the back of the forearm ; and (5) Downwards, the broad and open valley running down the front of the interosseous membrane between the two deep flexor muscles, down which there run, within easy reach of the dissector, the anterior interosseous artery & nerve. The anterior annular ligament of the wrist having been divided, and the flexor tendons, lumbricales, arteries, & nerves lifted up, as already explained, the dissector should separate the muscles arising from the inner condyle well up to their origins, and then lift up the flexor sublimis at its inner edge, but ivit/wut dividing its origiii from the radius. He should then forcibly flex the hand & fingers, and keep them in the flexed position by means of hooks & clamj)s. This will allow the dissector—(passages 1 and 2, containing the median nerve and the upper part of the ulnar artery, having first been opened up from the front)—to open up passages number 3 and number 5, and to clean (a) the posterior ulnar recurrent artery as it passes up beneath the flexor sublimis and then between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris in company with the ulnar nerve, and (b) the common interosseous and anterior interosseous arteries, with the interosseous branch of the median nerve, There remains passage number 4 between the upper border

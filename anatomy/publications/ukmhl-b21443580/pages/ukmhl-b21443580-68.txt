internal intermuscular septum. The former accompanies the ulnar nerve; the latter arises from the inner side of the brachial artery towards the lower part of the arm. II. FRONT OF FOREARM & PALM OF HAND. At the bend of the elbow preserve carefully the radial recurrent and anterior ulnar recurrent arteries. The superficial veins can scarcely be kept in siUt, as they wonld greatly impede the deeper dissection. The cephalic & basilic veins should, however, be left attached superiorly, so that they may be put back into position when the part is required for subsequent study. Take superficial dissection of palm of hand along with the dissection of tlie front of the forearm. One dissection helps the other considerably. The superficial dissection of the jmlm of the hand somewhat resembles that of the sole of the foot, an important difference resulting, however, from the fact that, while the arteries & nerves of the sole of the foot are, at first, quite deeply situated, those of the palm of the hand enter the region almost as superficial structures. While, therefore, the sole of the foot should be taken as a separate dissection—i.e., irrespectively of the hack of the leg—the palm of the hand is, for dissection purposes, the natural continuation, so to speak, of the front of the forearm. Cut down upon the upper part of the palmar fascia as it extends forwards from the anterior annular ligament over the upper two-thirds of the palm, and trace out the digital slips. It is between these slips that the digital arteries & nerves are to be looked for. They are more superficial, and will be found more easily than tho.se of the toes. In this situation,

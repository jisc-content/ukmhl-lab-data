81 ABDOMEN. After having dissected the parts concerned in inguinal hernia, the broad muscles of the abdomen, and the mesenteric arteries, and having removed these latter arteries, with the small and large intestines, the dissector should aim at getting out all the deep relations of the organs of the abdomen down to the crura of the diaphragm, in one preparation. The crura of the diaphragm should be thoroughly exposed without the removal of any impor- tant structure, except the solar plexus, which latter should of course be examined before it is removed.* This will require careful work; but the dissection, when finished, will amply repay for the labour spent upon it. The dissection should be divided into six stages, as follows :—■ 1. By the removal of the lesser omentum, the dissector should first expose the trunk of the coeliac axis, and trace out the com- mencement of the hepatic and splenic arteries, and the whole course of the gastric artery with its anastomosis with the pyloric. With the hepatic artery will be found the ductus communis choledochus, and the trunk of the portal vein. 2. The dissector should now remove the great omentum from the anterior aspect of the arterial arch which runs along the greater curvature of the stomach (gastro-epiploicae dextra and sinistra), and make out the vasa brevia. 3. The dissector should now free the spleen and the tail of * The two structurci rros'; likely to he removed inadvertently are the two spermntir ami the two iuf3rior phrenic arteries. The dissector should be mindful of them. G

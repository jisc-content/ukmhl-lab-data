31 the facial), looping backwards and upwards toward?, and then beneath, the temporal artery. This being done, the whole of the parotid gland should be removed,—Steno's duct being reflected upon the face, and the great auricular nerve & external jugular vein being left adherent by a strip of fascia to the front of the external ear. The removal of the parotid gland will expose the deep structures down to the vertebrae & the wall of the pharynx,— these including the stylo-glossus & -pharyngeus muscles and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and, beneath these, the several elements of the deep vasculo-nervous bundle of the neck. Of these latter, the one that requires most care is the superior laryngeal 7ierve. Arising from the pneumo-gastric very high up (from the ganglion of the trunk), it crosses behind all the other structures of the vasculo-nervous bundle, and while these are being cleaned, it is constantly exposed to be divided. The division of the stylo-maxillary ligament will greatly facilitate the cleaning of these deep structures. This ligament being divided, the angle of the jaw can be forcibly lifted up, when a considerable mass of fat will be found beneath it on the inner surface of the internal pterygoid. This can safely be removed down to the wall of the pharynx, when the vasculo-nervous bundle can be got at from the front as well as from the outer side. The superficial portion of the submaxillary gland being well turned down, and a little fat removed from the under surface of the mylo-hyoid, the submental artery and the mylo-liyoid branch of the inferior dental nerve will be seen on the under surface of the mylo-hyoid muscle, the latter close to the lower jaw. The former is prolonged beneath the anterior belly of the digastric.

52 Find the front part of the nasal nerve where it crosses the optic nerve. It is a relatively small nerve, which accompanies the ophthalmic artery. Find the front part of the lower division of the third nerve. This is a large nerve running downwards & forwards to the internal & inferior recti and inferior oblique. Trace the two nerves backwards with great care, dissecting along the npper aspect only of the nasal nerve, and along the loiver aspect only of the lower division of the third nerve.' From the back part of the upper aspect of the lower division of the third nerve a short thick trunk, about an eighth of an inch long, will be seen running upwards & forwards to the ganglion. This is the short or motor root of the ganglion. By carefully drawing the ganglion forwards, or by pulling carefully upon one of the ciliary nerves, a delicate filament about a quarter of an inch long will be seen to run forwards and slightly downwards from the loiver aspect of the nasal nerve to the ganglion. This is the long or sensory root. The ganglion with the two roots above named, and the ciliary nerves, lie in extremely loose cellular tissue, and are quite easily cleaned. The dissector is usually recommended to look for the lenticular ganglion b_v tracing one of the ciliary nerves backwards. In tlie ivrifer's opinion, the way above described is much the better. It is somewhat more difficult to make out the sympa-

109 superficial vessels & nerves, lymphatics, and glands, - requiring to be dissected in the usual way before the points of special interest are reached. In reference to the superficial parts concerned in inguinal hernia, it will, moreover, be convenient to take the coverings of the testicle, and, with them, the testicle, epididymis, & spermatic cord, as a preliminary dissection. The parts concerned in both hernise should be dissected first from the front and then from the back. As regards the dissec- tion from the back, both hernise should be taken together. (A.) FEMORAL HERNIA. (DISSECTION FROM THE FRONT.) The cribriform fascia can scarcely be differentiated from the deep layer of the superficial fascia. But the saphenous opening in the fascia lata should be distinctly made out as follows:â€” Trace up the internal saphenous vein, cleaning its tinder surface very carefully where it dips down to join the femoral. The blade of the knife should not be used here, but merely the flat of the knife, or forceps. By lifting up the vein, the lower boundary, or inferior cornu, of the saphenous opening should now appear quite plainly, - sharp and well defined.

107 Trace the superficial perinasal vessels & nerve very carefully forwards, bearing in mind that they not unfrequently perforate the transversus perinoei muscle. Clean the transverse perinaeal vessels. Now place the body in the lithotomy position, and dissect the perinseum proper. The superficial, or thick and fatty layer, and the deep, or thin and laminated layer, of the superficial fascia of the perinseum will easily be made out, - the deep layer binding down the two prominent, and apparently large muscles of the region, the accelerator urinse and the erector penis. The transversus perinsei has barely been referred to up to the present, but it has not been forgotten. It may have been seen through the fascia when the fibres of the sphincter ani were traced forwards towards the central tendinous point of the perinaeum- or when the superficial perinseal vessels & nerves were traced forwards from the ischio-rectal fossa, or when the transverse perinaeal vessels were traced inwards behind the position the muscle should occupy. If it has not yet been perceived, it is probably very small. In this case, remove, on one side, the deep layer of the superficial fascia of the perinseum from off two muscles above named, and carefully reflect it backwards. This will expose what may exist of the transversus perinaei.

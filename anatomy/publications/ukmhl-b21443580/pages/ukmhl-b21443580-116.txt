112 fascia is continuous. They cross the fibres of the external oblique, and bind together the two pillars of the ring. Note how the outer pillar blends with Poupart's ligament, and how the inner pillar decussates with its fellow in front of the symphysis. Make out the ilio-inguinal nerve as it emerges from the external abdominal ring. Divide the aponeurosis of the external oblique along a hori- zontal line drawn through the antero-superior spine of the ilium, or, better, a little higher. Again divide it downwards, close to the outer border of the rectus, to within a short distance of the external abdominal ring, Eeflect the piece of fascia, and thus show the lower part of the inguinal portion of the spermatic cord, with the lower arched fibres of the internal oblique—(the corre- sponding fibres of the transversalis may probably be made out already to some extent)—arching over the spermatic cord from before backwards & inwards and becoming tendinous inferiorly. The ilio-inguinal nerve will be seen lying in front of the cord. Similarly divide the internal oblique, and separate it from the transversalis. The separation will be found easy superiorly, but more and more difficult below. More of the inguinal portion of the cord will now be apparent; the conjoint tendon of the internal oblique & transversalis will be distinctly seen, and so will also Poupart's ligament as it forms the floor of the inguinal canal. The four boundaries or walls of the canal will thus be made plain ; and it will be seen how it is that both the internal

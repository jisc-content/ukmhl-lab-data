82 the pancreas from their deep attachments. Turning these up with the stomach (without stretching too much the delicate vasa brevia), he will get more thoroughly at the coeliac axis, and will be able to trace out fully the splenic artery and vein, and to make out the origin of the vasa brevia and of the gastro- epiploica sinistra. This is the time to trace out the pancreatico - duodenal arteries between and in front of the head of the pancreas & the descending portion of the duodenum. This is also the time to be careful not to remove the long and delicate spermatic or ovarian arteries. It is well to look for them early, and to draw them out of harm's way. They will be found arising from the front of the abdominal aorta just below the renal arteries. 4. The head of the pancreas and the descending portion of the duodenum should now be freed from their deep attachments, and lifted up. Between and behind them will be found the lower part of the ductus communis choledochus, which latter should be traced up with the hepatic artery and the portal vein to the transverse fissure on the under surface of the liver. 5. The two kidneys should now be freed from the loose fatty tissue in which they lie, and turned over with the renal vessels towards the middle line of the abdomen. All the loose fatty tissue which surrounded the kidney should be removed; the renal vessels should be cleaned; and, on the right side, the vena cava should be traced up to the fissure in the posterior border of the liver.

29 LOWER PART OF ANTERIOR TRIANGLE. The strncturos in the lower part of the anterior triangle (phrenic nerve, inferior th)Toid artery & inferior or recurrent laryngeal nerve, middle cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, vertebral artery) should be taken in conjunction with the dis- section of the thorax.â€”the latter cavity being widely opened in front, as in our way of presenting it. It will be a great help if the origins of the sterno-mastoid are chiselled off, and the muscle reflected as explained in note on page 25. Find in the upper part of the thorax the phrenic & pneumo- gastric nerves, and the innominate vein, and remove the soft adipose tissue in front of these and the trachea, detaching these structures from the sternum & clavicle. (This must be done without damaging the origins of the sterno-hyoid & -thyroid muscles.) It will then be easy to trace the two nerves into the thorax, and to follow the internal jugular & subclavian veins into the corresponding innominate trunk. This is the time to clean the subclavian vein, which is never easy to get at in the dissection of the posterior triangle of the neck. Trace the inferior or recurrent laryngeal nerve below and then behind the subclavian artery on the right side, and the arch of the aorta on the left; and follow^ it up in the groove between the trachea & oesophagus. Here the nerve lies behind the inferior thyroid artery. Trace the cord of the sympathetic. It lies behind the common carotid artery, and crosses the inferior thyroid artery anteriorly, presenting its middle cervical ganglion in about this situation. The inferior thyroid artery- can now be traced from the

96 (covered by a thick layer of deep fascia) from the tensor vaginae femoris, so as to preserve the inferior branch of the superior gluteal nerve, which goes to the tensor vaginae femoris; this branch emerges from beneath the anterior border of the gluteus medius. Divide the gluteus medius from before backwards towards its middle, tracing out the inferior branch of the superior gluteal nerve. Grluteal artery and superior gluteal nerve with their deep branches, superior & inferior. Sciatic artery & great sciatic nerve; small sciatic nerve; inferior pudendal nerve. Pudic artery & nerve, and nerve to obturator internus as they cross spine of ischium; trace same into ischio-rectal fossa. Hamstring muscles and great sciatic nerve. Clean posterior surface of adductor magnus. Now is the time to complete the dissection of the internal circumflex artery, the" obturator externus muscle, and the upper part of the adductor magnus. The termination of the artery appears between the adductor magnus and â–  the quadratus

67 now be completed; the muscles of the thumb & little finger being thoroughly separated so as to allow of the cleaning both of the radial artery as it enters the palm, and also of the deep or communicating branches of the ulnar artery & nerve. To show thoronglily how the radial artciy passes from the outer & back part of the wrist into the palm of the hand, the dissector should open up the several inter-muscular spaces from behind, from below, and from in front. From behind, he should well separate the two heads of the first dorsal inter- osseous muscle or abductor indicis ; from below, he should lift up, and clean underneatli, the adductor poUicis ; from in front, he should carefully separate the fore-named muscle from the flexor brevis. To complete the dissection of the deep palmar arch, the anterior annular ligament should be divided (it should be divided internally to the insertion into it of the palmaris longus tendon), and the flexor tendons, lumbricales, arteries, & nerves should be well lifted up; the sheaths of the tendons being first examined and then cleared away. This is also a sine qua non condition of the efficient cleaning of the deeper structures of the front of the forearm & bend of the elbow. The dissector will understand that it was to allow of the superficial structures being lifted up, as above explained, that their several prolongations to the fingers hid all to be thoroughly cleaned in the early stages of the dissec- tion. III. DEEP DISSECTION OF BEND OF ELBOW. In its deeper prolongations, the space at the end of the elbow may be con- sidered, from the dissector's point of view, to break up into five passages, each of which should be carefully opened up. These are :â€” (1) The passage between the two heads of the pronator radii teres traversed by the median nerve ;

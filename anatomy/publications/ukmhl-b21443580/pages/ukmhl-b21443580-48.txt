44 Parts beneath the Jiyo-glossns from below upwards :â€”)Stylo- hyoid ligament, lingual artery, glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The anterior & posterior borders of the hyo-glossus should be clearly defined. In front of its anterior border will be seen the terminal portion of the lingual artery and nerve, the tendon and the expanding fibres of the genio4iyo-glossus, and the genio-hyoid, to which latter a small twig should be traced from the hypoglossal nerve. Any structures that may have escaped cleaning behind the hyo-glossus, and on the inner surface of the internal pterygoid, may now be seen to. The removal of the mucous membrane of the fauces will expose the palato-glossus muscle as it lies in the anterior pillar of the soft palate. The lingualis inferior will be seen on the under surface of the tongue between the hyo-glossus and the genio-hyo-glossus. VI. THE ORBIT, AND CAVERNOUS SINUS. The orbit should be dissected both from above, and from the outer side.

But sucli union of knowledge does not properly match. It is one building built at different times, an addition to an original plan. It is no wonder, therefore, that the whole is imperfect.” Can we pronounce all later anatomists and writers on Natural History free from this reproach 1 His remarkable memoir on the life-history of the Honey-bee testifies to John Hunter’s excellence as a naturalist. For the convenience of closely observing his bees without disturbing them, he had hives constructed with glass windows, which allowed him at all times to watch their occupants. He enquires into the causes of the deaths of certain bees in winter. He mentions that “ there was plenty of honey in their hive ; that on closely inspecting the dead bees he found they all died with their proboscis extended, their stomachs were full of

19 HUNTERIAN ORATION. Priestley in 1774 ; and hydrogen by Cavendish in 1776, the year of John Hunter’s Croonian Lecture, from which I have just quoted. We know (as Palmer has noticed) that John Hunter and Cavendish were personally acquainted, for Hunter himself tells us that Cavendish examined for him “ air ” contained in certain bladders present on the intestines of a hog sent to him by Jenner. There is, then, no improbability in the supposition that John Hunter may have derived from Cavendish his know- ledge of the influence of gases on vegetable life. However this may have been, botanists have long recognized as a general principle the necessity of the presence of oxygen for vegetable life; further, that vegetables take in free oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere; and also that they are able to seize upon oxygen when it is presented to them in weak chemical combination. Of this latter action the reduction of oxyhcemoglobin to haemoglobin in the circulating blood by the bacillus of anthrax in animals dying of cattle-plague has been thought a significant example. In the absence of oxygen, plants are asphyxiated; vegetable protoplasm loses its irritability, though less quickly than does animal protoplasm, because the processes of vegetable life are less actively carried on than are those of animal life. When a plant is deprived of oxygen—as when it is placed in an atmosphere from which this gas is absent—during a short period the want of the B

HUNTERIAN ORATION. 25 it more frequently in the blood of breeding women, but he had seen it in others, and sometimes in men. Examined with the microscope he found this scum to be composed of globular particles which were not soluble in water, and which rose to the top when placed in water. This pathological condition has in recent years attracted much attention *. Many and varied experiments were made by John Hunter to determine the cause of the different colour of venous and of arterial blood. lie noticed the influence of respiration on the colour, and to the objection advanced by some, that in the lungs the blood cannot come into contact with the air, he opposed the familiar fact that the bright red tint assumed by the outer surface of a blood-clot when exposed to the atmosphere “ extends some depth into the clot, whence it is evident that air can and does penetrate animal matter.” Passing to the “ Vascular System,” we find that John Hunter notices the predominance of muscular over elastic tissue in the coats of the smaller blood- vessels ; and he then comments on their respective influences on the calibre of the vessels. He also notices the branching and anastomosis of arteries, and he discusses the effects of these arrangements on the velocity of the blood-current. Then he investi- gates the pumping force of the heart in relation to the resistances offered by the arterioles; the relative capacities of the venous and arterial systems; the * Traua. Pathol. Soe.

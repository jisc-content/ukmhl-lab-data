HUNTERIAN' ORATION. 35 present in the community, the queen, the males, and the Avorking-bee, which, as he quaintly expresses it, “ cannot be called either sex.” Finally he describes the anatomy of the Honey-bee, and he comments on its special senses. With equal thoroughness he investigated the life-history and habits of the Wasp and the Hornet. We also find him occupied in a study of the economy and anatomy of the Humble-bee (Bomb us terrestris), on which subjects he has left quite a long note. With unflagging industry lie examined all the inmates of a nest of this bee, and found them to comprise 157 females and 25 males. He noted that the former have longer proboscides than the latter. He observed that the Humble-bee does not colonize as does the Honey-bee ; it does not swarm ; a queen does not leave the hive attended by a large train of followers and found a new colony, but “ the family is begun by a single female, later assisted by her offspring.” None but young females live through the winter. On its approach they leave the hive or nest, and seek winter-quarters in holes, which are often in dry banks, whence they emerge in spring. Humble-bees make their nests generally underground. These he describes in some detail. Then he gives an account of the deposition of her eggs by the female; of the grubs which escape from these; and of the imago. The Black Humble-bee and the Leaf-celled-bee (Antho- phora retusa and Mcgachile centuncularis) were also objects of his study. He notices the habit of the c

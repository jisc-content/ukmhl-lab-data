21 HUNTERIAN ORATION. That plants, like animals, have “ a power within themselves of producing or generating heat ” did not escape John Hunter’s notice. He also investigated their power of resisting very low tem- peratures, employing in some experiments freezing mixtures; noting the effects of these on succulent as well as on woody plants, he found that the latter better resisted great cold. He also carried out a series of observations, pro- longed over a year, on the internal temperature of trees relatively to that of the external atmosphere. He mentions that he read his thermometers at six o’clock in the morning and again at the same time in the evening; and he says that he was obliged to discontinue the observations because the sap froze in the holes bored in the tree-trunks for the reception of his thermometers. He records that he was careful to allow a sufficient interval to elapse between boring the holes and inserting the thermometers in them in order that the heat generated by the friction of the “ gimlet ” might be dissipated; and he tells us also that he enclosed in a box the part of the thermometer projecting externally beyond the hole, and packed it in cotton-wool, in order to protect it “against all immediate external influences either of heat or cold.” John Hunter also made a series of thermal ex- periments on vegetable seeds similar to others he had made on eggs, and he mentions his intention to record these. No trace of such record has come down to us; if actually made, it may, perhaps, B 2

28 HUNTERIAN ORATION. died violent deaths, occasioned him much perplexity, and had made him, as lie says, “ suspect that the cause was not even imagined.” He tells us that the first time he observed these appearances was under circum- stances that precluded their causation by disease. “ The man had just before his death made a hearty supper of cold meat, cheese, bread, and ale.

These very incomplete references to some of his more important physiological researches prove that as an original investigator in this branch of Biology John Hunter was in line with the foremost workers of his day. How great an anatomist he was is evidenced by his published papers ; by the great value in which his lectures delivered in the "Windmill Street Rooms

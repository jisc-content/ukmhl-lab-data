As a zootomist and morphologist John Hunter could not be satisfied with the highly artificial zoo- logical classification of his time, He marks that the want of an adequate knowledge of these preliminary and indispensable studies had led even the great classifier Linnaeus into some very singular arrange- ments in the earlier editions of his ‘Systema Naturae,' of which John Hunter mentions one, viz., the placing together, in one order of Mammalia, man, the elephant, and the bat, because in each the mammae are pectorally situated.

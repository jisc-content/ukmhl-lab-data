HUNTERIAN ORATION. eight in the evening I saw the Dragon-fly flying 3G latter in cutting out pieces of the leaves of roses, strawberries, and bogwood, and he admires the dexterity they evince in carrying these into their holes, and the skill and neatness shown in adapting them to construct their cells. His attention was not restricted to Hymenoptera, for every animate thing frequenting his garden, or that he met with in the country, seemed equally to attract him. So he has left us* notes of his observa- tion of three common beetles. Of the Dung-beetle (Gcotrupes stercorarius) he records that in June lie found the grubs nearly ready to assume the pupal phase, and that the perfect beetle escaped from the chrysalis at the end of July or in the beginning of August. The grubs he found were in nests at the bottom of holes sunk 12 to 18 inches below the surface of the ground, and these were usually near cow-dung. lie also treats at some length of the economy, life-history, and anatomy of the Common Cockchafer (Melolontha vulgaris), and with less detail he notices the Itose-beetle (Cetonia aurata). Two common Orthoptera seem to have particularly interested him, and so we find him commenting on the form and anatomy of the Grasshopper (Acrida viridissima), noting what he discerned of the structure of its eye and speculating on its vision. He detects the predatory habit of the Dragon-fly (sEsclina grandis) and makes the following highly character- istic note of his discovery:—“Aug. 18th, 1778, at

DEDICATION. Tins Oration, delivered in the Theatre of tiie Royal College of Surgeons of England on February 14th, 1895, the 167th Anniversary of JOHN HUNTER'S BIRTH, by J. AY. Hulke, President, is by him dedicated to his Colleagues in the Council, at whose instance it is published. Note. The above dedication was prepared by the Author of this Oration in anticipation of the Council’s usual request; but his death from inflammation of the lungs on February 19th —five days after the celebration of the Hunterian Anniversary—deprived the Council of the opportunity of expressing its wishes. Under these sad and exceptional circumstances, the Council has undertaken the publication of its late President’s Oration as a tribute to the memory of one for whom all its Members had a high regard, and has delegated the duty of seeing the work through the press to Mr. Thomas Bryant, a past President of the. College, who, at a few hours’ notice, kindly read the Address on February 14th.

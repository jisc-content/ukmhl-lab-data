8 HUNTERIAN ORATION. investigator and interpreter of “ Organic Nature.” Of John Hunter in this character I can, however, offer you only a very incomplete sketch, since even if the time at my disposal permitted, and had I the necessary ability for such a task (a gift I may not claim), the materials for a complete presentment of him as a Biologist do not now exist; for ten large bound volumes of manuscript, written mostly by his assistants at his dictation, and then revised, added to and corrected by himself, embodying the records of the labours of many years, purchased together with his museum by the nation, which made our College their custodian, were about 30 years after John Hunter’s death designedly burned by Sir Everard Home, his brother-in-law and executor. When inter- rogated by the Board of Curators respecting this act, he alleged that he had destroyed these MSS. by John Hunter’s expressed desire, as being by him considered too imperfect for the public eye. That these ten volumes of MSS. were included under the words “ collections and everything belong- ing thereto,” which John Hunter in his last will directed should be offered to the Government “in one lot,” is not open to doubt; yet Sir Everard Home, shortly before the transfer of the “ Collections ” from Leicester Square to Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and there- fore after their purchase, had them removed to his own house. The Board of Curators of the Museum of the College appear not to have known that the MSS. had existed until after their destruction.

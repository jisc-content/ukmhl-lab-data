From it we learn how much patient investigation, how much concentrated thought he bestowed on the striking phenomenon of its coagu- lation. This (he remarks) is not a property of the blood as a whole, but only of one of its component parts — the “coagulable lymph.” Then with nice determination he adds, “ This would better be termed coagulating lymph,” since “ blood-serum also contains a coagulable substance which, however, needs the addition of a chemical agent for its change from a liquid to a solid state.” John Hunter considered “coagulable lymph” (fibrine as we term it) to be the most important constituent of the blood, chiefly because he found it universally present in the blood. He sought to ascertain the influence of temperature on the coagu-

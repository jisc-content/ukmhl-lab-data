32 HUNTERIAN ORATION. cated by him to the Royal Society on a series of fossil bones from caves at Gailenreutli presented to that body by His Serene Highness the Margrave of Anspach, we find John Hunter investigating the circumstances of their fossilization ; comparing the forms of these bones with those of extant animals ; reviewing the geographical distribution of animals in past time ; and speculating, from the gisements of fossils, upon the form, etc., of the earth’s surface in past ages. From these and similar considerations John Hunter inferred a duration of our earth prolonged through “ many thousand centuries.” This chrono- logy was so greatly at variance with that then universally accepted, that a statement of it in a second memoir sent in by him to the Royal Society caused so great misgiving in its Council, as led to a suggestion being conveyed to him through a friend that he should substitute years for centuries. With characteristic adherence to his convictions, John Hunter would not modify his original statement, and he withdrew the paper. Owen mentions this on the authority of William Clift. John Hunter’s researches were not limited by the walls of the dissecting-room, museum, and study; outside these he was a close observer of wild living nature. He was fully alive to the great value of both these lines of work.

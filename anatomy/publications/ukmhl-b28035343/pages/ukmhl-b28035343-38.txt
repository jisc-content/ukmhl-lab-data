HUNTERIAN ORATION. 34 honey, and their intestines, especially the lower part, also full of excrement.” No circumstance, however minute, eluded his notice! Next we find him making observations on the heat of bees. “ Without warmth,” he observes, “ they became dull, inactive, and torpid.” He tells us :—“ On July 18th at 10 o’clock p.m., wind northerly, thermometer at 54° in the open air, I introduced it into the top of a hive full of bees, and in less than five minutes it rose to 82°, and at one o’clock to 84°, and at nine in the evening it was down to 78°.

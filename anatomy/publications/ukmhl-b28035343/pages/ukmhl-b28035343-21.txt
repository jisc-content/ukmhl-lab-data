17 HUNTERIAN ORATION. It is now known that the movements of the Mimosa leaflets are attended with the production of feeble electric currents. Such currents have also been demonstrated by Professor Burdon Sanderson to attend the movements of the leaf of Dioncea Musci- pula. Dr. Kunkel, working in Sachsâ€™s laboratory, has since then demonstrated that weak electric currents accompany the movement of water in the vegetable tissues, however this movement is origin- ated, and thus the generation of such electric currents proves not to be peculiar to leaf-movement excited by external stimulation. Whilst experimenting on the Mimosa, John Hunter observed that when he touched the leaflets the visible effects of the local stimulation spread to the neigh- bouring leaflets, which he saw bend down in pairs until all the leaflets of the compound leaf were folded. lie noticed, also, that this progressive effect of the stimulus spread from the point where it was applied more readily in the direction towards the stem of the plant than in the opposite direction towards the peripheral end of the leaf. Sachs, and with him some others, appear disposed to regard the petiolar axile vascular bundle as the path along which the molecular disturbance initiated by the application of the stimulus travels ; but, whether this or the parenchymatous tissue is the path, it seems probable that a molecular disturbance in the living, active cell-protoplasm is the efficient cause of the afflux of water that produces the leaf-movement.

HUNTERIAN ORATION. 31 a doubt whether they were all original, or none of them, or, if any one be original, which that one is.” He refers to the variability of species in more than one passage, and he makes the significant comment that some variations are transmissible to offspring. He tells us that “ it may certainly be laid down as one of the laws of Nature for species to deviate from their type under certain circumstances ”; and he continues, “ It is neither necessarv nor does it follow that all deviations from the original must be a falling off; it appears just the contrary; therefore we may conclude that nature is improving her wTork, or at least has established the principle of improvement in the body as well as in the mind.” In these passages, laboured and somewhat deficient in perfect clearness of expression, we find John Hunter enunciating the principles of the inherent variability of species ; of the modifying influences of environment ; of the transmissibility of variations from parent to offspring; and of evolution from lower to higher life forms ; in short, in those of his memoirs which we possess there is to be found abundant evidence that his mind was often and deeply engaged in the consideration of the pregnant questions comprised in the idea of evolution, around which so much and such fierce controversy has been waged in our own day. The significance of past forms of life did not escape him : he studied their fossil remains, of which he collected a large number. In a memoir communi-

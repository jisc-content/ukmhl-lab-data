15 HUNTKRI AN ORATION. concerned in the movement of the Mimosa leaflets, John Hunter discovered that “the motion is princi- pally confined to one part, and this differing from the others in external appearance, which difference is its increased thickness and uniformity of surface.” Thus he locates the motor-mechanism in the swelling at the base of the petiole, and in the homologous parts of the stalks of the leaflets. Next he tells us that he slit longitudinally the swelling on the “ foot-stalk,” and also that part of the stem on which it stands, and he is about to record what lie saw in these parts—but here, as Palmer notices, there occurs a blank in the manuscript, which leaves us in ignorance of what he actually discerned in them. I do not gather from the context that John Hunter employed the compound microscope in this investigation. The contrary appears more probable, for the use of the microscope was then only dawning, and vegetable histology had made relatively little advance since Malpighi began to cultivate it in the latter half of the preceding century. We at our stand-point can hardly conceive the possibility of Malpighi holding concurrently the Chair of Botany and that of Zootomy in his University—Bologna. Yet in both these chairs he made discoveries which gained for him enduring fame. We medici are wont to think of Malpighi as an anatomist only, whose honoured name has come down to us chiefly in association with certain minute bodies in the kidneys and spleen, and with a certain stratum in the skin ; but botanists revere Malpighi

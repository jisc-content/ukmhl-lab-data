HUNTERIAN ORATION. 16 as the founder of vegetable histology. For John Hunter it may fairly be claimed that he pushed his investigation into the motor-mechanism of the Mimosa leaflets as far as was then practicable with the means at his command. Later investigators have demonstrated that when in a young, vigorous, succulent Mimosa plant a cut is made with a sharp knife into the petiolar swelling dividing its paren- chyma down to the central strand of vascular tissue, a drop of water oozes from the wound, upon which follows the well-known movement of the leaf. In the absence of this effusion of water no movement of the leaf occurs. Professor Julius Sachs, who in late years has done so much to advance the study of vegetable physiology, has further demonstrated that the visible leaf-movement is caused by the afflux of water in the petiolar parenchyma, distending this tissue and thus causing it to become elongated more than the less extensile axile band of vessels. By such distension of the mass of parenchyma situated above the axile vascular bundle, the upper part of the petiolar swelling is lengthened disproportionately to the lower part, and the leaf of necessity bends down; whereas when the lower mass of the paren- chyma is turgid the opposite occurs, and the leaf erects itself. By the device of removing first the upper and then the lower mass of parenchyma, Sachs was able to demonstrate that only the latter massâ€”that lying below the axile vessels is endowed with this irritability.

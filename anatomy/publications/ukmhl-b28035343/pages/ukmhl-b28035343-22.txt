U3 HUNTERIAN ORATION. 'J he protoplasm of adjoining vegetable cells is now known to be continuous through minute openings in the cell-walls, so that we are warranted in regarding the protoplasm in living vegetable tissues as a con- tinuum ; and thus the propagation of a molecular disturbance to considerable distances beyond the point of application of a mechanical stimulus origin- ating it becomes easily intelligible. John Hunters experiments on the Mimosa were not limited to the effects of mechanical stimulation. He also experimented on this plant with heat, with chemical solutions, and with ether. He tried also the effect of a tight ligature placed around the stem or branch, and he found that when the part below the ligature was cut, very slight or no movement of the leaf occurred. Continuing his discussion of the resemblances between animals and vegetables, he remarks “ that vegetables are supposed with great reason to have an action analogous to breathing, for the same kind of air which kills animals which do breathe, certainly kills vegetables also.” John Hunter touches this subject so briefly that he leaves us in uncertainty whether he had himself experimentally investigated the influence of gases on plant-life, or had merely adopted the conclusions of others This latter appears to me more probable, when we bear in mind the stand-point of the chemistry of the gases in his day. Carbonic acid gas was discovered by I31ack in 16C7 ; nitrogen by Priestley in 1772; oxygen also bv

HUNTERIAN ORATION. 20 external supply of oxygen is in some measure com- pensated by the atmospheric oxygen previously enclosed in the air-spaces of the vegetable tissues; perhaps, also, some oxygen is derived by the plant from the decomposition of weak chemical combina- tions of oxygen normally present in certain chemical substances contained in the tissues; but these limited sources of oxygen are soon exhausted. To this general law of the necessity of oxygen for the maintenance of vegetable life certain low forms appear to offer notable exceptions. Thus the Yeast- plant (Saccharomyces cerevisice) can live and even increase in an atmosphere devoid of oxygen. Its highest life-phase, however, requires the presence of oxygen, for the plant does not produce spores unless it has access to the atmosphere. Then, also, there are certain Schizomycetes to which free oxygen seems to be positively hurtful—they die in its presence. The explanation of this singular phenomenon is still wanted. The final products of the oxygen taken into the tissues of the plant are carbon-dioxide and water. Of these the former is exhaled from every part of the plant’s external surface. This, Van Tieghem says, is the most constant phenomenon of plant-life; and thus in the matter of gas-exchanges we find con- firmed the impressionhnentioned by John Hunter as current in his day, viz. that a very close corre- spondence exists between vegetable and animal respiration.

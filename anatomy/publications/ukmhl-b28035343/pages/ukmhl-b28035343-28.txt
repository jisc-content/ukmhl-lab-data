The effect of rest and of motion on the coagulation of the blood also occupied his attention, with the result that he was led to regard rest as an important direct factor, but not the immediate cause. The final outcome of all his experiments and ob- servations on the blood was the view respecting its coagulation which I state in his own words :—“ That the fluid state of the blood is connected with the living vessels which are its natural situation, and with motion ; and that where there is full power of life the vessels are capable of keeping the blood in a fluid state.” I)o not these views harmonize closely with those now held on this subject 1 The white corpuscles of the blood appear to have been unknown to John Hunter, which will not surprise us if we bear in mind the imperfection of the compound microscope of his day, and also the entire absence of our numerous aids, of which I need only instance the use of differential staining agents, by which so many delicate details of minute structure have been disclosed. How narrowly John Hunter scrutinized every un- usual circumstance that came before him is shown by his remarks on Liphcemia. He writes:—“The serum of the blood is often wlieyish, and then upon settling it often throws up a white scum like cream.” “ This wras most probably first observed in human blood, but it is not peculiar to it.” He had noticed

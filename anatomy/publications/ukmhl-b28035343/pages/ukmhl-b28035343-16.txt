He remarks that “ the leaf of iJioncea upon being touched closes up, and as it were confines the stimu- lating cause ”; that it shuts and entraps the insect which, in alighting upon its upper surface, has touched the little cluster of extremely irritable hairs, those projecting above the general level of the cuticle. Of the Mimosa pudica he remarks that it bends its leaflets in response to a coarse mechanical stimulus and also to the subtle excitation of varying quantities of light incident upon them. In connection with excitation of light he mentions the Goat’s-bcard (Tra- gopogon) and Calendula pluvialis, two plants in the large order Compositce, and he says that they and many other plants close their blossoms towards night or at the approach of rain. Of this habit our indi- genous Centaurcas (Erythrcea), once of high medicinal repute, and the Scarlet Pimpernel (Anagallis arvensis) supply familiar examples. Then he passes on to tell us that some other plants, as certain species of Con- volvulus, open their flowers in the evening and close them at the approach of the sun. In striking con- trast to these dusk-loving plants, he mentions that nearly the entire class Diadelphia (now Leguminosee), which comprises, he adds, chiefly “ wing-leaved plants,” close their leaflets “ towards night, not ex- panding them till morning,” and he remarks that this phenomenon had been called by Linnaeus the “ sleep of plants.” This reference to the great Swedish botanist is interesting, because it proves John Hunter

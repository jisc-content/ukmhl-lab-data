HUNTERIAN ORATION. 38 as essential characters “ a four-chambered, heart, lungs confined to a proper cavity, the enlargement of which is the cause of respiration; lungs divided into small cells; respiration quick; viviparous,” etc. ; whilst circumstantial characters are found in the construction of the auditory organ. This illustration will suffice to prove how sound and how advanced were John Hunter’s views as a Systematic Zoologist. If in this sketch, imperfect, incomplete, as I know it to be, I have in some small degree succeeded in presenting to you our Great Master, as one of the most indefatigable workers, one of the most earnest seekers after truth, one of the very closest of skilled observers, one of the most sagacious expositors of the facts of vegetable and animal life, I shall not, I hope, have altogether failed in the design I aspired to place before you on this commemorative day—a presentment of John Hunter as a Ufologist, in the truest and widest sense of this now much used word.

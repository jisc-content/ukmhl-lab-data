The remains of the pollen tube are observed to be still adherent to the sac. The rudiment of the embryo exhibits itself as a somewhat pear-shaped cell, divided towards its upper part by a succes- sion of transverse septa, into numerous compart- ments. The lowest of these, larger and more granular than the rest, is the parent-cell of the embryo. 180 diam. (The above, from 191 to 108 inclusive, are original.) of Phancrogamia.

(Henfrey.) central cylindrical column (connective), along the anterolateral aspects of which are at- tached two larger cellular masses; the outer surface of each is marked by a vertical furrow, indicating its division into two halves, which are the rudiments of the future loculi. In each half a single axile vertical column of cells soon becomes distinguished from those surrounding them by their greater size and granular contents. In each of these cells the nucleus disappears, and is replaced by two others, this being followed by a division of the cell contents (primordial membrane), which results in the formation of a new cell round each nucleus. By the repeti- tion of this process a mass of cells — the parent-cells of the spores—is formed, which occupies the centre of each rudimentary loculus. The next change observed is the thickening of the walls of the parent-cells by gelatinous deposition on the interior surfaces. This is followed in all of them by disappear- ance of the nucleus, and consequent division of the contents of the cell (primordial mem- brane) into tvvo portions, each surrounding a new nucleus. These, however, are only trans- itory formations, and are soon succeeded by four permanent nuclei, which are placed towards the four angles of a regular tetrahe- dron, each invested with a primordial sac con- taining a granular mucus, on the surface of which is soon secreted a gelatinous layer. In this manner the parent cell is divided into four compartments—the so-called special parent cells of the pollen grains. Within each com- partment is now formed a new cellulose mem- brane on the surface of the primordial utricle. This is transformed into a resistant and co« loured tegument, which is the outer mem- brane of the pollen grain, and exhibits various projections of its surface, which differ ac- cording to the species. 109. While these changes are taking place in the central mass of each loculus, the tissue forming its wall is transformed into a capsule of three distinct cellular layers. The inner

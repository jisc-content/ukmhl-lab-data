97 PANCREAS. these arrangements are liable to considerable variety, and perfectly independent of the in- timate structure and function of the gland, for in different individuals of the same species, the arrangement of the ducts is generally the same, however the segmentation of the gland may vary. The gland substance is firm, much more dense than in other orders, and not di- vided so distinctly into lobes and lobules: it has a finely granular and mottled appearance, in colour pink, or a little yellowish, or brownish. The pancreas seldom communicates with the intestine in birds by a single canal, the ducts are generally either two or three in number, and each continues independent and separate to its orifice. They do not communicate either with one another or with the biliary canal: although, however, exceptions are very rare, Cuvier has met with an instance in the stork, in which the single pancreatic and hepatic ducts united and opened by a common orifice. The following table, altered from Cuvier, shows the number of the pancreatic ducts in several orders of birds, and their relative si- tuation witli regard to the hepatic and cystic ducts ; it also shows the relation of these last to one another. That canal which is first indi- cated has its insertion the nearest to the py- lorus ; P. stands for pancreatic, H. for hepatic, and C. for cystic. We see from this table, that, as a rule, the 1.

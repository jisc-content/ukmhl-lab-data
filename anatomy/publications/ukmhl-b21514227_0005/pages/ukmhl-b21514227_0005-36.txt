They are afterwards set free, and in this state are found floating as minute whitish particles in the fluid of the cyst. They then present the appear- ance of minute heads of Taeniae, with a short body scarcely larger than the head ; the latter part being furnished with a terminal double circle of hooklets, and four suckers.f The mode of gemmation may probably vary in different circumstances, more particularly in regard to the extent to which the progeny of gemmation may or may not repeat the for- mation of others of the same kind ; but every thing that is known of the acephalocystic productions seems to point to the view that they are all nearly allied, and that they are abnormal or aberrant conditions of Taenia- larvae, which, when they become encysted, are incapable of development into the cestoid form which belongs to those that have reached the free intestinal habitation. The Cagnurus, which has been met with principally in the brain and some other parts of the sheep and some other Ruminating ani- mals, consists of a large cyst or vesicle with a number of small heads projecting on its ex- ternal surface: each head resembles closely that of an echinococcus animalcule, presenting the same circle of hooklets and four suckers. According to H. D. Goodsir, they are at- tached to the middle membrane of the cyst, from which they sprout at first, carrying the outer one along with them : the neck contains * E.

The Cysticercus has been described in two forms; 1st, in its simply vesicular state, and 2nd, in its fasciolated condition, or in its transition, as it may beheld, to the cestoid, or tape form. The vesicular Cysticercus has Fig. 24.

They are usually developed singly, that is each vesicle with one head: but some ob- servers -j* allege that they have seen internal vesicles near the neck, which they look upon as young, or as a progeny of gemmation in that situation. The Cysticercus fasciolaris, as it has been observed in the rat and mouse, presents the remarkable fact of a Taenia in various states of development, from the vesicular condition of * IT. D.

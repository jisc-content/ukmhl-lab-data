(is OVUM, gradually acquires the peculiar dry hardness which characterises it after the egg is laid.* The view of H. Meckel that the animal basis of the shell is formed by the separation of a layer of the mucous membrane of the ute- rine part of the oviduct does not appear to be established. During the time that the shell is forming, the distinction between the softer and thinner external albumen, and the more dense and deeper part, becomes more obvious, and, at the same time, according to M. Coste, a cer- tain degree of liquefaction occurs in a layer of albumen immediately surrounding the yolk, which allows the latter body to float more freely within the superincumbent albumen. The egg remains in the uterine dilatation till it is about to be laid. The expulsion of it from this cavity through the narrow part of the tube, leading into the cloaca, requires very strong muscular contraction for its ac- complishment ; and, although the egg always descends in the oviduct, and usually lies in the uterus, with its narrow end downwards, both Purkinjc and Von Baer state that they have sometimes seen its position inverted towards the end of the time of its residence there in consequence of the force of the mus- cular contractions of the wall of the oviduct. Ovarian ovum of birds ; ovulum ; yolk and its contents. â€” The yolk, yelk, or vitellus (Jaune, Fr. Hotter, Germ.) consists in the newly laid egg of the external enclosing vitelline membrane, of the yolk substance, a mass of vesicular, cellular, and granular matter of va- rious structure, to which as a whole the membrane gives a subglobular form, and on the surface of this mass, below or within the vitelline membrane, and on that side of the yolk which naturally turns uppermost in the complete egg, the cicatricula, or embryo spot, a thin disc of organised cellular structure, in which, under the influence of heat and air, as during ordinary incubation, the embryo, and its accompanying foetal membranes, &c, are first formed. The cicatricula of the laid egg, as has al- ready been remarked, however, has, during its descent through the oviduct, undergone some part of those changes which belong to the Fig. 49.

The outer- most layer of the lining membrane adheres very firmly to the shell, which may have misled some on this point, who describe the animal basis of the calcareous shell as of the same structure with the fibrous lining membrane. of motion, which is controlled, as before ex- plained, by its own specific gravity, and by the attachment of the chalazae. The yolk substance is not of the same nature throughout, there being a part of a lighter colour in the centre, about one fourth of the diameter of the whole; from this, a narrower prolongation extends upwards

Viewed edgewise, as represented in the following sketch, the arrangement of these respiratory membranous extensions may be more fully understood. On the branchial processes of the eel these leaflets amount to 700 in number ; on those of the turbot, to 900 ; on those of the cod, to 1000; on those of the salmon, to 1400. Especial attention is invited to fig. 237. It shows that only the mucous membrane (i. c. the layer of epithelium and basement membrane) is doubled upon itself, so as to assume the form of folds, the stratum of capillary blood being single. From this beautiful arrange- ment it results that the blood, in its passage through the labyrinth of this plexus, must present two sides of an extremely divided stream to the agency of the circumfluent medium. If the network of vessels were duplicated upon a supporting basis, only one side of the sheet of blood could re- ceive the influence of the surrounding me- dium. Regarded mechanically, such a plan would present little of the delicacy and per- fection which really distinguishes this most elaborate specimen of organised structure. This single-\i\yer disposition of the respiratory vessels, doubling thus the surface of exposure, obtains as the universally prevailing type of structure in the breathing organs of aquatic animals. It is an arrangement which faci- litates in a very remarkable manner the inter- change of gases between the blood and the water. The capillary vessels of the branchiae of fishes, in internal diameter, exceed very little the long axis of the blood-eorpuscle. The internal calibre of these channels varies from ^^jj to yJ-0 of an inch ; the blood-cor- puscle in the cod measure in the long dia- meter -i-jVr inch, and the channels forming the capillary network present in all parts precisely the same calibre. Cartilage, or Supporting Si/stem of the Branchice. â€” The skeletons of fishes are struc- turally distinguishable into three classes ; the osseous, fihro-cartilaginous, and true car- tilaginous. In the conventional language of comparative anatomists the last is described as the least completely organised, and the first the most. This distinction, however, which obtains in the adopted nomenclature of science, has no counterpart in that portion of the skeleton which sustains the foliage of the branchiae. In the petromyzon Jluvialis the wicker-work of cartilage which Miillcr has called the cartilaginous basket of the branchiae, and which Prof. Owen regards as homologous with the epibranchial system of osseous fishes, detaches processes of almost membranous tenuity stretching inwards to supply a mechanical support to the slender respiratory foliage. In the myxinoid families, cartilage and calcigerous structures are sub- stituted, in various parts of the body, by elastic fibres. In the osseous fishes the Fig. 237.

From this class, accordingly, the following illustrative details will he drawn. The respiratory segment of the skeleton com- prises the hyoid system and its dependen- cies, in which are included the branchio- stegal rays and the branchial arches, on which, finally, is elaborated an exquisite arrange- ment of solid points upon which important mechanical functions devolve, in the move- ments of the apparatus of respiration.* The * As it is the design of this paper to refer no more to the descriptive departments of comparative anatomy than is found indispensable to elucidate questions of ultimate structure, I must refer the reader, for the solution of the homological and tele- ological details on this subject, to the work of Prof.

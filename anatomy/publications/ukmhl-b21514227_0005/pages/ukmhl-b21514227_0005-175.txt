103 PANCREAS. Very lately this subject has been taken up by several able physiologists, and Bernard*, Frerichs f, and Bidder and Schmidt J, have given to the world the results of careful and elaborate researches both into the physical and chemical characters of the fluid and its physiological action. I shall describe first the observations of these inquirers on the qualities of the secretion, and, afterwards and sepa- rately, their views of its physiological office. It is very remarkable, that the differences in the accounts given by these recent investi- gators are very closely analogous to those ex- isting between the results of the researches above described. They all agree, however, as to the invariable alkalinity of the secretion, the absence of sulpho-cyanides, the existence of a specific nitrogenous principle, and, in general, to its possession of strong differen- tial characters when compared with saliva. According to Bernard, the pancreatic secre- tion obtained artificially during the life of the animal is of two very distinct kinds, which he characterizes as normal and morbid; the for- mer obtained when the experiment is made under favourable circumstances, before inflam- mation has attacked the pancreas, or which is collected from a dog possessing a permanent pancreatic fistula; the latter always secieted in great abundance when the symptoms of in- flammatory reaction appear in the pancreas and in the wound in the abdomen. The normal secretion, which, adopting Ber- nard's view, is of course the secretion, he de- scribes as a colourless, limpid, viscid, ropy fluid, without any characteristic odour, and having a saline taste very like that of the serum of the blood. It is constantly alkaline. Exposed to heat, it is converted into a solid white mass; the coagulation is as entire and complete as that of white of egg, the whole becomes solid, not a drop of free liquid re- maining. The other reagents of albumen equally precipitate it. The alkalies produce no precipitate, and redissolve the organic matter when it has been previously coagulated by heat, alcohol, or the mineral acids. But, although exhibiting the same reactions, Ber- nard believes that this nitrogenous principle is essentially distinct from albumen, not only in a physiological point of view, but in its in- herent nature; and, as a proof of this, he cites the fact, that when it has been coagulated by alcohol and dried, it is easily and entirely redissolved in water, whilst albumen, similarly treated, is not dissolved to any appreciable extent. () These characteristics of the fluid, which are given from the dog, Bernard says obtain equally in rabbits, horses, and birds. The morbid pancreatic fluid, which is alone thrown out when the experiment is tardily or * Arch.

It is poured out very abundantly : Bernard collected from a dog more than half an ounce in an hour, whereas of the normal he found 31 grains a maximum. The normal is not transformed into the morbid secretion suddenly, but gra- dually, losing, as it becomes more and more watery, its physiological properties, of w hich at last it is quite destitute. This observation of Bernard's is very important, as showing the facility and extent to which the fluid may be changed, and doubtless it goes some way to explain the discrepancies of the ac- counts which different observers have ren- dered, but it is not entirely sufficient for this, as, in some hands, a watery fluid with but little albuminous matter and of very low specific gravity seems to have been obtained at once, even under circumstances the most favour- able. Frerichs, who has made a most complete analysis of this fluid*, and with wdiose ac- count Lehmann-j- agrees, describes it as co- lourless, clear, very slightly tenacious, without taste or smell, of alkaline reaction and a spe- cific gravity as low as 1-008 to P009 ; heat, alcohol, and acid, produce but a slight turbi- dity; of solid constituents he found it contain but 1*36 per cent, in the ass, and 1*62 in the dog. Schmidt's account is something interme- diate between the other two; he describes the fluid as ropy and viscid, and as being coagu- lated by heat into a milky mass, from which white flocculi subside, leaving above a clear, strongly alkaline fluid. He agrees with Bernard in the solubility by water of the precipitated and dried albuminous matter ; he states the specific gravity of the fluid at 1*031, and the quantity of solid constituents at 9-024 per cent.; in one case the amount of solids reached 11-5G per cent.

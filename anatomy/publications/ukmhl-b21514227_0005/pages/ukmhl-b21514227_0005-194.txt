The three latter joints are of the kind usually denominated " sym- physis" and considered by many as included also in the class " amphi-arthrosis." The sacro-iliac joints, however, most fre- quently presenting two contiguous surfaces and two separate plates of incrustingcartilage.ought rather, as Albinus remarked, to be considered as "arthrodial" forms of articulation, while the pubic symphysis occupies an intermediate or transitional position between the fibro-carti- laginous or mixed, and the arthrodial joints. The sacro-coccygeal joint is composed of a fibro-cartilaginous disc, and an anterior and posterior ligament. The fibro-cartilaginous disc is a miniature of the intervertebral, inter- vening between and adherent to the opposed articular surfaces of these bones, being, how- ever, less evidently pulpy in the centre. Ac- cording to Cruveilhier, there is sometimes found a synovial membrane in the centre of this joint. The anterior sacro-coccygeal liga- ment consists of a thin layer of fibres passing from one bone to the other in front of the joint, and spreading over the whole coccy- geal surface. The posterior sacro-coccygeal ligament is much stronger and more developed. It springs from the edges of the notched in- ferior opening of the sacral canal by a thick band of fibres, which includes also, as an in- vesting capsular ligament, lined by a synovial membrane, the articular extremities of the sacral horns, and, gradually narrowing down- wards, is attached to, and extends over, the whole posterior surface of the coccyx and its articular processes, covering in the inferior aperture of the sacral canal, and connecting the several pieces of the coccyx when they remain separate. In the latter case also are found in/ra-coccygeal articulations, small fibro- cartilaginous discs intervening between the several bones. This, according to Levret, is most constant between the first and second pieces of the coccyx, where it is sometimes met with in advanced age. The motions of this joint, and those of the coccygeal bones, are simply antero-posterior flexure, and are sometimes, especially in females and young subjects, very extensive, forming, Cruveilhier says, a complete anterior projecting angle. This anatomist also mentions having seen many times anterior sacro-coccygean mus- cles ; other anatomists also mention posterior sacro-coccygean muscles blended with the fibres of the ligament.

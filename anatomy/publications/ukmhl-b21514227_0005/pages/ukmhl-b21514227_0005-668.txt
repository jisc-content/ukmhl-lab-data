UTERUS AND ITS APPENDAGES. 596 therefore, the course which each of these organs takes, is different for either sex. The male Wolffian body never disappears in all its parts, but is converted into the epididy- mis in such a manner that the middle line of cascal tubes {Jig. 401.c c) is transformed into the 18â€”20 coni vasculosi (fig. 402. c) ; while their straight and open ends, as vasa efferen- tia, establish a communication with the rete vasculosum testis. The upper blind pouches (JigAOX.a, 6) and the bulb (/) of the excre- tory duct disappear, or become converted into the hydatids (fig. 402. b, /) upon the head of the epididymis, while the inferior pouches (fig. 401. d) disappear in part, and in part become elongated and tortuous, without forming any connection with the testis. These constitute the hitherto enigmatical vasa aber- rantia of Ilaller (fig. 402. d). The excretory duct of the Wolffian body (fig. 401. e) is converted into the canal of the epididymis, (fig. 402. e), and ultimately into the vas deferens, and whilst the retro- gression and final obliteration of the terminal part of this duct takes place normally in the female, (fig. 403. e) it constitutes a patho- logical condition when it occurs in the male. The terminal bulb (fig. 401. i) of the duct of Miiller is converted into the hydatid of Mor- gagni (fig. 402. i), whilst its inferior por- tion (jig. 401. h) still exists, at a later period in the anterior border of the epidi- dymis (fig. 402. //). Tracing the development of the corre- sponding structures from the same point of departure as in the male, we find that in the female, also, the Wolffian body never dis- appears entirely, but is employed in the for- mation of the parovarium.

These three last figures are from Kobelt, whose views they illustrate. The letters refer to correspond- ing parts in each. excretory duct of the Wolffian body (/g.401, c) for the male, the capability of conver- sion into either sex exists at this time in every individual. The division of sex begins to be anatomi- cally discoverable by the development of one, Fig. 402. Adult testis and epididymis, anterior view.

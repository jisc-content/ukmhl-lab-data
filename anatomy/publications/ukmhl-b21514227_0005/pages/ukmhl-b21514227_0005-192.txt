PELVIS. 120 The Coccyx (fig. c), the huclcle, or whistle bone (named from its supposed resemblance to a cuckoo's bill, from kokicv£, Gr.; Os coccygis, Lat. ; t'Os coccyx, Fr. ; das Steissiein, or Schioanzbein, Germ.), is an appendage to the apex of the sacrum, and terminates the spinal column inferiorly. It forms the posterior boundary of the lower part of the cavity, and inferior outlet of the pelvis, assisting to complete its walls, to sustain its contents, and to attach some muscles of the leg and perineum. Its position is oblique from behind, forwards and downwards, but being normally movable on the sacrum, it yields to pressure in both ways. It is usually composed of four, rarely five pieces or tu- bercles, which are generally, but not always, soldered to each other, and diminished in size and completeness downwards. When in one piece, it presents a tapering, elongated, knob- bed appearance with an anterior and posterior surface, two lateral borders, and a base and apex. The base presents a plane, oval, arti- cular surface (a), corresponding to the apex of the sacrum, with which it is articulated, and sometimes ankylosed. Behind this, on each side, projects upwards and backwards a cornuated process (b), tipped with an ellip- tical articular facet, directed upwards and forwards, to articulate with the inferior sacral horns. Below these, the borders commence, presenting three alternate notches (e), and tubercular projections (c), of which the first are much the largest, and complete the sacro- coccygeal foramina. The borders are ter- minated by a knobbed, sometimes bifurcated apex, and give attachment to the sciatic liga- ments, and some muscles (d). The first two of these notches are converted into holes by ligaments, for the passage of the posterior branches of the fifth and sixth sacral nerves. The anterior surface is slightly concave longi- tudinally, and smooth, to support the rectum. It has transverse markings, similar to the sacrum. The posterior surface is correspond- ingly converse and rough, to attach ligaments and muscles. The internal structure of this bone closely resembles that of the sacrum. Develofement.— The innominate bone is developed by three primitive and Jive com- plementary points of ossification. The three primitive points commence in the three component parts of the bone, the ilium, ischium, and pubis respectively, from a single piece of cartilage of the general form of the bone. That of the ilium is placed in the thick, arched rib above the cotyloid cavity, (fig. 79. a, a), being apparent, according to Cmveilhier, the first in order, about the fiftieth day of foetal life. Bischoff, however, says that the time of its appearance varies from the second to the fourth month, in dif- ferent individuals. About the fifth month, it acquires somewhat of the form of the com- plete bone. That of the ischium is placed in the upper part of the descending ramus (b), and appears second in order of time, always later than the ilium, about the end of the third month, or, according to Bischoff, the fifth month. That of the pubis appears in the superior branch, near the ilio-pectineal eminence (c), at the end of the fifth month. Bischoff' fixes it later than Cruveilhier, at the sixth or seventh month. At the period of birth, the cotyloid cavity is still principally cartilaginous (e), the ascending branch of the ischium, the descending of the pubis, and nearly the whole circumference of the ilium, still remaining in the same condition (d). At the age of six or seven years, the branches of the ischium and pubis are united by bone. About the time of puberty, as first pointed out by M. Serres, a distinct complementary point of ossification appears in the cartilage dividing the bones in the cotyloid cavity, which soon including the whole of the Y- shaped cartilage at this part, and assuming its shape and serrated margins, finally unites them in the raised line before described. According to Meckel, the pubis and ischium join first with each other, and the ilium becomes united to them afterwards. At the same time appear the four remaining com- plementary points as epiphyses, in the fol- lowing order : namely, 1. On the whole length of the iliac crest; 2. At the anterior inferior spine, not constant, and said to be more fre- quent in the male than the female ; 3. Along the whole extent of the tuberosity of the ischium; On the symphysial surface of the pubis, said by Beclard to be more often found in the female. All these are soldered to the bone, about the twenty-lourth or twenty-fifth year, the epiphysis of the iliac crest being the last to join. Fig. 79. Development of the lanes of the human pelvis. (After Quain and Sha?pey.) A. Innominate bone of a full-grown foetus; a, primary ossific point of ilium; b, do. of ischium; c, do. of pubis; d, d, cartilage; e, Y-shaped cen- tral cartilage. . B, sacrum and coccyx at birth; a, central ossific points; b, characteristic sacral do.; c, coccyx still cartilaginous. The sacrum is produced by the soldering together of five vertebrae. Hence they have been called the false or sacral vertebrae. Oc- casionally six pieces have been found, and, more rarely, according to Scemmerring, four pieces only are present. Each of these five pieces, as in the other vertebra?, results from three primary points of ossification, viz., one for each body or central portion, anil two for the posterior lateral surfaces and lamina? of each vertebra. These appear later

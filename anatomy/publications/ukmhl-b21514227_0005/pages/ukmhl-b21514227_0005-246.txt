SERIAL HOMOLOGIES OF THE PELVIC BONES AND LIGAMENTS. The sacrum, according to Professor Owen, is to be considered as the centrum of the pelvic vertebral elements. The ankylosed bodies of the sacral vertebrae, as well as their coalesced laminae, spinous and articular processes, are sufficiently evident as the representatives of those components of the neural arch in the typical vertebra.* The lateral masses of the sacrum which support the ilia are, however, made up of two elements coalesced together, as is shown in the manner of their develop- ment, before described, viz., first, of the true transverse processes, or " diapophyses" con- stituting the external row of tubercles seen on the 'posterior surface of the sacrum, and which are ossified, like those of the true vertebrae, by extension from the same points of ossification as the laminae, and spinous and articular pro- cesses ; and, secondly, of the six characteristic sacral ossific points, three on each side of the three upper sacral bodies, which are placed on the anterior surface of and below the former, between the sacral foramina, as before de- scribed. These ossific points, as shown in prepara- tions exhibited to the British Association, in 1837, by Mr. Carlyle, were four in number on each side, and very distinct from the true transverse processes; and they were con- sidered by him to represent the necks and heads of four sacral ribs on each side. Upon the truncated extremities of these three or four sacral ribs the auricular facets are sup- ported. They appear to be similar to the anterior roots of the cervical transverse pro- cesses, upon the last of which is occasionally developed, in the human subject, a short costal process. In the nomenclature of Professor Owen, they may be considered the sacral" pa- rajiophyses,''' but differ from these processes as seen in the rib-bearing vertebrae of the Croco- dile, in being developed by separate and distinct centres. Blainville remarks that the four upper sacral vertebrae, scientifically considered, com- pose the whole of the true sacral elements ; and that the fifth, which he calls " subsacral," is an ankylosed coccygeal vertebra. But the lateral epiphysial plates of bone before described — the upper of which forms the auricular facet, opposite the three first, and the lower, the sides of the two last sacral vertebras — would seem to connect these vertebrae more particu- larly together, and to be the coalesced serial homologues of the epiphyses forming the ar- ticular facets on the tubercles of the ribs. In the Saurian reptiles these sacral ribs, two in number on each side, are very distinctly analysed, and have been before mentioned as intervening between the sacrum and the ilia. The anterior of these ribs in the Saurians are said by Mr. Carlyle, to be articulated to the bodies of the last dorsal and first sacral ver- tebrae, as well as to the intervertebral sub- stance between them'; and the posterior, to the last sacral and first caudal vertebrae, and to their intervertebral substance — affording an exact homologue to the true ribs. The ilia in the human foetus, and for some years after birth, are connected to two only of the sacral vertebrae ; but, in the adult state, they * A remarkable analogous instance of the coales- cence of vertebra! to form one solid mass is seen in those of the cervical region of the bottle-nosed Whale.

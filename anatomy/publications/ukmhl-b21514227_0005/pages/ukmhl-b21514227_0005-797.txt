PLACENTA that flows around it, becomes thinner, and finally gives way by extension. But long be- fore this stage arrives, the whole of this por- tion is shut out from the maternal circulation, and the subsequent metamorphoses are di- rected to the strengthening of the more limited space which remains. It is on this account that the strong border of decidua is formed around the margin of the now restricted area. The base of the placenta now consists of the tough and resisting chorion; while that por- tion alone of the decidua which is strength- ened externally by the uterine walls is retained to form the opposite boundary. Ultimately, as the current of maternal blood flows with increasing force into the placenta in propor- tion to the growth of the latter, this becomes subdivided by the decidual septa, which ap- portion the entire organ into separate placen- tulae, and thus the larger supplies necessary to the increasing exigencies of the foetus are disposed of without danger of rupture to any portion of the organ. The changes in the more minute structures which belong to the foetus are not less inter- esting. The profuse development of fine capillaries within the foetal tufts, which is so conspicuous from the third to the sixth month, is connected not only with the functions of respiration and nutrition of the foetus, but also with the growth of the villi themselves. But when the period of viability of the foetus has arrived, the proportionate amount of capillary vessels within the villi becomes greatly re- duced, until finally only the original stems of the vessels are left. And this relative reduc- tion of the channels through which the foetal blood flows, becomes more marked, until, as the time of birth approaches, many of the villi become more or less obliterated, and cease to admit blood, often in consequence of that calca- reous degeneration which, from the frequency of its occurrence, may be regarded rather as a normal process significant of natural decay than as an evidence of any morbid or preter- natural change. The series of metamorphoses is closed by the degeneration of the materials which bind the placenta, and consequently the foetus, to the uterus. The layer of decidua forming the connecting medium between the uterus and the foetal structures, in common with the rest of this membrane, suffers slow disintegration, and its component cells are converted into molecular fat. And now the strength of the adhesion being gradually diminished, it only remains for the contractile power of the ute- rus to be evoked in order to accomplish the separation together of the foetus anil placenta, like ripe fruit detached from the parent bough.

The preceding distribution of the morbid conditions of the air passages may be advan- tageously methodised under two heads : first, those of the bronchi (as defined in the account of their normal anatomy) ; secondly, those of the lungs. The bronchi are liable to several forms of inflammation : a. Acute bronchitis. b. ('hronic bronchitis. c. Plastic bronchitis. Collapse of the lungs should be considered, pathologically, as rightly ranking under the denomination of the diseases of the bronchi. The various forms of asthma, and hooping cough, belong to this species.* The bronchi are subject to two forms of dilatation. In the first, a tube is uniformly dilated at every part of its circumference. In the second, the dilatation is saccular. The * For an account of the morbid statis of the larynx, and upper part of the trachea, see Art. Larynx. small bronchi and those near the surfaces and borders of the lungs are most liable to suffer this change. The walls of the tubes at the dilatations are hypertrophied and thickened. Sometimes, with the saccular variety, the same parts are relaxed and attenuated. The bronchitic col/apse of the lungs occurs under two distinct aspects, the diffused form, and the limited or lobular form. Of these the latter variety is the more striking or cha- racteristic, and has been, especially in the lungs of children, the subject of more discus- sion than the former. But the diffused form is by far the more common, and is of frequent occurrence in its slighter degrees. In botli conditions the pulmonary tissue presents a dark violet colour as seen beneath the pleura ; internally it is red. In considering the causes which tend to produce this condition they seem to resolve themselves into the following: 1st. the exist- ence of mucus in the bronchi, which is more liable to produce obstruction according as it is more thick and viscid ; and 2ndly, weakness or inefficiency of the respiratory power; 3rdly inability to cough and expectorate. Of these conditions, the first must be considered as the exciting cause, the others as predis- posing, co-operating with the first, but in- capable, without it, of producing collapse.* With bronchitic collapse of the lung is almost always associated emphysema of the unaffected portions of the same lung(Gairdner). Inflammation of the mucous membrane of the bronchi produces changes which are denoted by redness and tumidity of the tissue, a secretion of muco-serum, purulent mucus, or pus, according to the stage and intensity of the inflammation. This latter is the condition of superficial suppuration. The swelling of the mucous membrane and sub-mucous tissue, which as- sumes the form of watery infiltration into the * For a full discussion of this interesting subject, see " Pathological Anatomy of Bronchitis, and the Diseases of the Lung connected with Bronchial Ob- struction."

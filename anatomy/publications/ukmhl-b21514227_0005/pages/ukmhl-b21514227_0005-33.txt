There are,in fact,scarcely any intermediate stages of non-sexual exist- ence such as are described in the true in- stances of alternate generation. It is deserving of notice, however, that Lowig and Kolliker are of opinion that in some of the Botryllidae numerous embryoes are at once developed from a single ovum by its division, these indi- viduals subsequently multiplying by gemma- tion into the perfect sexual animals.

(After Van Bciteden.') and now from its own body in some, and in others only from the spreading part of the stem or base which supports it, proceeds the gemmation of other individuals of the colony, all of which apparently are capable of sexual generation when they arrive at maturity.J The Ascidian Tunicata present another mo- dification of the reproductive process now under consideration. Two forms of these animals exist, both perfect, viz. the simple and the compound; but these are not related to each other in the same manner as the two kinds of Salpians; for each kind is capable of propagating its like by generation. The soli- tary ones rarely multiply by gemmation, and when they do so the individuals separate from the stock; but the compound animals always undergo this mode of multiplication, and the multitude of individual Ascidians are in this form collected together in a mass of various shape, in which the circulation of fluids is for a time common among the different indivi- duals. The individual animals produced from the stock by gemmation attain to sexual com- pleteness, and propagate by means of ova, in the same manner as the solitary or distinct Ascidise do. The young of these animals undergo a re- markable metamorphosis : they are first ex- cluded from the egg in the form of a moving tailed body, somewhat like a minute tadpole; and this caudal organ of motion is lost pre- vious to their becoming fixed, and the deve- lopment of the more complex organisation.-j- Although the changes to which both the Bryozoa and Ascidian Tunicata are subject in * Van Beneden, in Mem. de Bruxelles, torn, xviii.

This process has been so well and fully described in the article Tunicata, that it is not necessary to give more than a short outline of it in this place. These animals are known in two states, viz. solitary and ag- c 4t

GENERAL INDEX. 859 3 K 2 Skeleton — continued. the variable proportionals of sterno- costo-vertebral archetypes, iv. 638. XXXII. the hyoid apparatus occurs opposite to the cervical spinal region, where we know costal quantity to be lost; the hyoid ap- paratus refers to the cervical vertebra;, and consists of their ribs metamorphosed, iv. 6+0. XXXIII. the ventral apparatus occurs opposite to the lumbar spinal region, where we under- stand that costal quantity is lost; the ventral apparatus refers to the lumbar vertebra?, and consists of their ribs meta- morphosed, iv. 643. XXXIV. clavicles, coracoid bones, and ribs are iden- tical parts of the costovertebral whole quantities or archetypes, iv. 644. XXXV. marsupial bones, pubic and ischiadic bones and ribs, are identical parts of the costo- vertebral whole quantities or archetypes, iv. 618. XXXVI. chevron bones and ribs are identical parts of the costo-vertebral whole quantities or archetypes, iv. 650. XXXVII. the sternal median line ranges from the maxilla to the pubic bones of the abstract archetypal skeletal fabric, iv. 651. XXXVIII. every fossil skeletal species of extinct animals, as well as every recent existing species of skeleton, is a form created of the archetypal skeleton, iv. 655. XXXIX. the cranio-facial apparatus consists, like the thoracic apparatus, of variable propor- tionals of the sterno-costo.vertebral quan- tities, iv. 655. XL. the scapulary or fore-limbs of all the verte- brated animals are homologous to one another; the variety among these or- gans occurs by a metamorphosis or omis- sion of elementary quantity, iv. 661. XLI. the scapulary and pelvic members are ho- mologous, iv. 664. XLI I. the sterno-costo-vertebral quantity is a pro- portional of the dorso-ventral quantity, iv. 667. XLIII. the scapulary and pelvic pairs of limbs are proportional quantities metamorphosed from the dorso-ventral archetypes, iv. 669. XLIV. the cranio-facial apparatus of segments are proportionals oi the dorso-ventral arche- types, iv. 673. XLV. the cranio-facial apparatus is the origin of the dorso-ventral archetypal series, and the caudal apparatus is its termination, iv. 673. XLVI. tiic uniform archetypal series undergoes a graduated metamorphosis of its quanti- ties for the production of all varieties of skeletal species, iv. b/4.

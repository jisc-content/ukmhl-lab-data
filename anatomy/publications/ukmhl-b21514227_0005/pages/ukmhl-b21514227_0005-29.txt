19 OVUM. In a certain number of the Campanulariag, Sertulariae, and Tubulariae, of which the in- ternal structure is more complex than in the Coryne, and in which the Polype always na- turally presents a branched form, or groups of distinct Polype heads formed upon a common stem by gemmation, it is now well ascertained that the Polype state is not the only nor the complete condition of the animal, but that by Fig. 13. Branch of Sertularia geniculate, magnified, shewing polypes, and ovigerous capsules. a process, in some instances similar to that above described, in others, somewhat different from it, a set of bodies, charged with the office of the sexual production of the ova, are deve- loped in place of the more ordinary Polype heads or individuals. In the Campanularia ge- latinosa, according to Van Benedcn, the gene- rative heads are close bell-shaped capsules, within which small Medusoid bodies are deve- loped by a process apparently analogous to gemmation, or, at all events, without sexual generation, and each of these Medusoids be- coming free, move about in the adjacent fluid as independent animals. The farther destina- tion or changes of these Medusoid bodies have not yet been observed, but from parallel observations in other similar animals, it is believed that they afterwards attain to sexual completeness, and form ova which are de- veloped into the Polype form.* * See the View of Campanularia geniculata, by Van Beneden, in Mem. de l'Acad. de Bruxelles, 1844, vol. xvii.; and Ann. des Sc. Nat. torn. xx. p. 350, 1843.

According to Desor, of Boston J, the same Campanularia may at one time produce two kinds of capsules, the one set containing ova the other spermatozoa ; the Medusoid progeny not being developed, and the ova giving rise to forms similar to the parent Polype: and M. S. Schultze, of Greifswald, has confirmed this statement§, apparently without the know- bularia, in Dalyell's Remarkable Animals of Scot- land. * In Wiegmann's Archiv, 1837. f Phil.

N N 3 OVARY â€”(No explained by the much smaller number of blood-vessels that it contains, as compared with the general parenchyma of the ovary. The tunica albuginea, therefore, is not merely a more condensed form of the ovarian stroma, but appears to result from a development of tissues which exist in the stroma in an ele- mentary or embryonic form, as well as from a more close conjunction and blending of those tissues. 2. The Parenchyma orStroma,(fig- 371. c, and Jig. 372. s) constitutes the proper tissue of the imal Anatomy). 549 ovary. It lies immediately beneath the tunica albuginea, and fills up the whole of the inter- mediate space between the ovisacs, to which it acts as a germ bed, protecting the ova from injury, and serving for the conveyance of blood- vessels to the ovisacs. This tissue is some- times of a pule-pink, but more often of a bright-red colour, from the large number of blood-vessels which it contains, whose ar- rangement proceeding from within, and radi- ating outwardly in all directions, gives to this tissue, when viewed by the naked eye or by Fig. 371.

OVUM. 15 testine, and anus, and moves actively through the water. Sars who had observed this body in 1835, was the first to suggest in 1844 that it might be the early condition of a star-fish*, and this view was confirmed by the admirable researches of J. Miillerf, and by observations of Koren and Danielson J, who have shown that the Asterias is gradually formed out of a small granular mass which surrounds the stomach of the Bipinnaria, and becomes se- parated from the stock when in a compara- tively early state of advancement. The larva stock moves about afterwards for a few days, Fig. 8. Platens paradoxus {from Muller).

Miiller as a distinct animal, under the name of Pluteus, before he was acquainted with the phenomena of its subsequent de- velopment : in 1846 he traced the relation between one kind of this body which he had called Pluteus paradoxus, and the Ophiura, and between another kind of Pluteus and Echinus, ascertaining it to be the same that has just been stated to exist between the Bipinnaria and the Asterias. The Pluteus presents the form of a quadrangular pyramidal frame, with four large ciliated limbs at the angles, and four smaller ones suspended from the middle below, while the upper part is surmounted by a sort of dome. It bears some resemblance to a Beroe, and might be de- scribed as the ciliograde larva of an Echino- derm. The form differs, however, somewhat for various species of Ophiura and Echinus. In the centre of the dome and round the mouth of the Pluteus a granular mass is de- scribed, and from the side of this, non-sym- metrically, the gemmation of the new indi- vidual proceeds. The Pluteus moves at first with great activity through the water, pro- pelled by its ciliated limbs and cirrhi; but as the new Ophiura or Echinus buds from it and spreads more and more over its dome, the Pluteus shrinks, becomes less active, and at last disappears.* Various other forms of the Pluteus-like animal have been described by Miiller, and the process of gemmation has been traced by which the new Echinoderm lakes its rise within them. The result of these discoveries is already to throw an entirely new light on the nature and organisation of this class of ani- mals ; but the species of all of those observed is not yet determined, and something still remains to be learned of the exact mode of origin of the new animal. By some f the process has been looked upon merely as a secondary development from the remains of the yolk attached to the parts first formed ; but the researches of Miiller do not appear to give support to such a view ; and would rather appear to show (as in Auricularia, fig. 9.), that the new animal is formed from a minute germ in a determinate part of the parent animal without that germ being traced to the yolk of the egg. In a farther series of researches on the larvae and metamorphoses of the Echino- dermata \, J. Miiller has pointed out that the Holothurida; are formed from a larva body somewhat analogous to the Pluteus, but that, instead of a process of new formation, the whole of the larva is converted by a very remarkable metamorphosis into the Holo- thuria ; and he has been enabled, from his * J.

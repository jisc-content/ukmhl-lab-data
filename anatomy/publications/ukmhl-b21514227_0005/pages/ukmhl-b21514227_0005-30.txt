C). The various modes of production as they have been observed in the Tubularia by Van Beneden*, have been so fully detailed in the Article Pol ypifera, that the reader is referred to that article for an account of them. But it is to be observed that the reconversion of the Medusoid progeny of this animal into the Polype form described by that author (see Article Polypifera,^. 50., p. 45.), has not received confirmation from the researches of other naturalists. Much remains still to be learned of this remarkable process; but enough has been ascertained to show that in a certain number of animals, usually known as passing the greater part of their lives in the Compound Polype condition, the state of sexual com- pleteness frequently belongs not to the Polype, but to a progeny having the form of a Medusa, and produced by a non-sexual process of de- velopment from the Polype stem. Acalephes.— Some time before the peculiar history of the development of the Polypina, now sketched, was discovered, an equally curious and unexpected phasis in the genera- tion of some Acalephae or Medusas had been established by the concurrent researches of several inquirers ; by which it was shown that the animals familiarly known as sea nettles existed for a time in the early stages of their development in the form of an attached poly- poid, and were produced by a process analo- gous to gemmation, or transverse fission, in numbers from this Polype stock, -f- Adult Medusas are perfect animals in which the male and female sexual organs are placed on distinct individuals. The fecundated ova which they produce are first developed into a ciliated moving animalcule somewhat like a polygastric infusorial!. This creature, after * Mem. de l'Acad. de Bruxelles, torn. xvii. t The Swedish naturalist Sars appears to have taken the lead in this discovery, as early as 1828, by his observation of the Compound Polypoid, from which the Medusa? are thrown off; and subsequently, in 1835, by the discovery that this animal, or stro- bila, is really the 3'oung condition of a Medusa, or rather a colony of Medusas. Very interesting obser- vations of a similar kind were published by Dalzell on this body, under the name of Hydra tuba, in 1836, but his observations probably date from an earlier period (Edin. New Phil. Journ. vol. xxi. 1836). Sars pursued the investigation of the process further, and published the results in Wiegmann's Archiv, 1837 ; but the complete account of his observations was not published in the same Journal till 1811; see also Ann. des Sc. Nat. for 1841. In the meantime V. Siebold had arrived at precisely similar conclusions, and subsequently their views have been fully con- firmed by Dalycll (Remarkable Animals of Scot- land) ; J. Reid (Ann. of Nat. Hist. 1848, and Phy- siolog. Researches); Steenstrup (Alternations of Generation) ; and Huxley (Phil. Trans. 1849, part ii.)

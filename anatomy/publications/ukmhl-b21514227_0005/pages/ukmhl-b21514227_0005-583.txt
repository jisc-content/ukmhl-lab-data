RUMINANTIA. 511 Fig. 329. Front view of the slmll of the Deer. (From Lonil. Coll. Surg. Museum.) the preceding genera is only feebly indicated, though tolerably prominent in the Giraffe. The anterior wing extends horizontally for- ward and is convex on its orbitar surface (d,fg. 327.). Part of the body of the pos- terior sphenoid forms, in conjunction with the anterior third of the basi-occipital, two projecting elevations, which are separated from each other by a deep groove : these also appear in the Goats, where they are less marked. In both families the spheno-palatine and the spheno-orbitar foramina are capacious; but in CEgosceridsE the latter openings are somewhat compressed. The os ethmoides has the same relations as usual, its cells being greatly developed in the Giraffe. The temporal bone (10), as in other mam- malia, consists of three segments. In Came- lidas the Zygomatic arches form, in conjunction with the sunken temples and strongly pointed occipito-parietal crests, a striking feature, which imparts to the cranium of this family a carnivorous type of structure. This mor- phological peculiarity is chiefly noticeable in the Camels properly so called; and in them the glenoid cavity is very deep, being sup- ported in front and behind by prominent apophyses, the posterior of which is united at this portion of the bone is compressed, and, in consequence of a central space left unossi- fied (Jig. 330.), we are enabled to look into Fig. 330. Side view of the sliull of Moschus. (From a specimen in Lond. Coll. Surg. Museum.) the orbit of the opposite side ; a peculiarity not confined to the animals under con- sideration, being more marked in certain of the Kodentia and in birds. In Bovidae the temporal wing of the sphenoid, which is of comparatively large size and much curved backward, does not reach the parietal bone as in the other ruminants ; and it is further distinguished by a sharp pointed ridge de- veloped from its anterior margin, which in

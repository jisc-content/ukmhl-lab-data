MultUocular, Compound, or Proliferous Cysts. â€”In these a second, or, it may be, a third, order of smaller cysts are developed, within or upon the walls of a larger or parent sac. From these walls the secondary cysts, at a comparatively early period of their growth, are seen projecting inwardly in hemispherical form, arranged along the parietes of the sac, from which they commonly spring by broad bases. These secondary cysts are invariably anil permanently attached to and continuous with the walls of the superior cyst. They are covered by a continuation of the same membrane which lines the principal sac, and which is reflected over them in the same man- ner that the heart is invested by the reflected pericardium, or the testis by the tunica va- ginalis.* Fie. 394. Tlie left ovary distended into one large cyst, into the interior of which project numerous smaller cysts of a secondary order. To the right of the figure is the uterus.

UTERUS AND ITS APPENDAGES. 668 sions, which furnish the sole opportunities for ceptible of impregnation after it has escaped impregnation, bear the same constant relation from the ovary. The period of susceptibility to menstruation that the acts of ovulation and in the mammalia generally is variable. In the the times of conception in the mammalia bear bitch, as already stated (p. 606.), the ovum, to the oestrus, it becomes necessary to exa- after quitting the ovary, is supposed to re- mine more closely the grounds of this belief; main in the tube during six or eight days.

Pouchet believes that a slender decidua is always formed at the decline of each menstruation, which, together with the ovum, whenever the latter is not impregnated, is cast oft' from the uterus between the tenth and fourteenth day, and that after this event every woman remains incapable of conception until the next menstrual period, when the detachment of another ovum from the ovary renews her capacity for impregnation. t For a fuller statement of this view, with illus- trative examples, see p. 568.

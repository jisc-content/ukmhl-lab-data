The subsequent change of each of these polypoids is remarkable. It has been described by Sars and Dalyell as follows : â€” The body undergoing some elongation be- comes partially divided by transverse grooves, into a range or column of imperfect Medusa?, attached still to each other by their adjacent surfaces, but presenting at their borders, in various degrees of advancement, the division into rays or lobes which belong to the Me- dusa; the upper or terminal one having deve- loped upon it a set of radiated processes dis- tinct from the tentacles of the Polype and much longer than those of the rest. These young Medusas are successively separated from the stock by the deepening of the transverse clefts between them. They then move about as independent animals, and proceed in their farther growth and development to sexual and other completeness. These bodies, therefore, are subject to two kinds of multiplication, which are very different: by simple gemma- tion a number or a colony of Strobila; may be produced, and by transverse fission and deve- lopment a number of Medusas may be thrown off from each Strobila. A considerable number of the Medusa pro- geny having been separated, the Strobila stock generally returns to its polypoid condition, Fig. 17.

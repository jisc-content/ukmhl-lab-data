PANCREAS. 92 form; they are two in number, ample, conical, and recurved, projecting back from the duo- denum at its very commencement, so as to give it a barbed or arrow-head appearance, as seen in the drawing (Jig. 65.). The stomach in this fish is very small, and the duodenum Fig. 65. Pyloric cccca of the Tiirbot. a, oesophagus; b, stomach ; c, intestine. (Drawn one-third the natural diameter.) very large, and the food probably passes into the intestine with but little delay. The caeca in this case must be considered an exception to the rule I have above laid down, that they are never filled with the contents of the alimentary canal; for in the specimen I examined they were complete!}' stuffed with taenia?, with which also the intestine was filled. Fig. 66. Pyloric cccca of the Sprat (Clupcea sprattus). a, oesophagus; b, stomach; c, intestine. (Na- tural size.) In the Sprat, the pyloric caeca are nine in number, long, slender, and simple (see Jig. 66.) : the upper five unite together at their bases, and open into the duodenum, close to the pylorus by one orifice; the last four open separately, each by its own orifice, in linear series along the duodenum. In the Gadidce, as in the whiting {Jig. 67.), the caeca are arranged in the form of a ring, Fig. 67. Alimentary canal of the Whiting (3Ierlangus vul- garis), showing the pile of cccca around the pylorus. {One half the natural diameter.) constituting a frill around the intestine, and consits of four bunches, each containing about thirty ca-ca. These unite and re-unite till they terminate, each bunch, in a single duct; so that there are finally four orifices, so placed as to fall on two converging sides of a triangle, of which the orifice of the hepatic duct would form the apex. As each bunch contains thirty caeca, there are a hundred and twenty Fig. 68.

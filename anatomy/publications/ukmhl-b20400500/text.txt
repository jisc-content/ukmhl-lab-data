FOUBTH EDITION, BEVISED. LONDON: WALTON AND MABERLY, UPPER GOWER STREET; AND IVY LANE, PATERNOSTER ROW. 1856.WELLCOME INSTITUTE LiBRABY Coll. welMOmec Cal! No. /PREFACE. The plan of this work has been retained without alter- ation in the present edition. It was devised for the purpose of teaching Anatomy by the dissection of the several parts of the Human Body in successive layers or stages; and the mode of proceeding observed in its execution has been thus explained in a former Preface. In the examination of a part or region, the attention of the student is directed first to its limits, to the superfi- cial prominences of bone and muscle, and to the hollows that point out the situation of the subjacent vessels. The different strata interposed between the surface and the bones are next examined in succession, with refer- ence particularly to the natural position of the several objects and their connections with each other, so that they may be observed in much the same order as they would be met with in an operation of surgery. The anatomical description of the whole is likewise arranged in conformity with the mode of dissection, and each bloodvessel, nerve, or other structure, is described only to such an extent as it may be laid bare in the region under examination. In this edition of my " Demonstrations of Anatomy," I have endeavoured to make the work more complete by the correction of inaccuracies, and to render it more efficient, as a guide to dissection, by the introduction of such alterations as greater experience in teaching has shown to be desirable. The instructions for conducting A 3vi PREFACE. the progressive stages of a dissection have also under- gone careful revision, and are better adapted to aid the student in following the more difficult directions, and to assist him in distinguishing objects which become visible on the removal of the superficial parts. Little alteration can be made in each forthcoming edition of a work on Practical Anatomy. The chief additions to this volume are included in the account of the structure of the urinary and generative organs, and the organs of the senses. G. V. E. University College, London.

CHAPTER I. DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. Section I. EXTERNAL PARTS OF THE HEAD. Directions. — In the dissection of the head and neck, the Parts to student should endeavour to learn the anatomy of the parts before described in the first sixty pages before the first position L^turn-^ of the body is changed; but should want of time necessitate an omission of some part, the examination of the facial nerve (p. 39.) can be best deferred till a subsequent stage. The orbit on one side, and the posterior triangular space on both sides of the neck, as well as the objects on the exterior and interior of the head, should be examined whilst the body lies on the back. Position, — During the examination of the superficial Position parts of the head, the body lies on the back, and the head, body^ raised to a suitable height, is to be turned to the right side. On the left side the muscles are to be seen, and on the opposite half the vessels and nerves are to be displayed. Muscles OF THE EXTERNAL EaR. Three muscles Muscles attach the outer ear to the side of the head. Two are above ear. it, one elevating, the other drawing it forwards; and the third, a retrahent muscle, is behind the ear. There are other special or intrinsic muscles of the cartilage of the ear, which will be afterwards described.DISSECTION OF THE EXTERIOR OF THE HEAD. 2 Dissec- Dissection, — When the ear has been drawn down by the up- hooks, the position of the two upper muscles will be indi- cies^"^" eated by a slight prominence between it and the head; and the muscular fibres will be laid bare by means of the two following incisions, made no deeper than the skin. One of these is to be carried upwards along the cutaneous ridge before mentioned and the side of the head, for about three inches; and the other is to be directed from before back- wards close above the ear, for nearly the same distance, so that the two may join at a right angle in the middle of the last. On carefully raising the flaps of skin from below upwards, and removing a little subjacent tissue, the thin muscular fibres will come into view — the more anterior constituting the attrahens, and the posterior the attollens aurem muscle, ofpos- On drawing forwards the ear, a ridge marks, in like muscle, manner, the situation of the posterior muscle. To remove the integuments, let the scalpel be drawn down, about an inch behind the ear^ from the transverse cut above as far as to a level with the lobule of the ear, and then forwards below the lobule. After the piece of skin included by these cuts has been reflected towards the ear, the retrahent muscle will be easily found beneath the subcutaneous tissue, for it is stronger though deeper than the others. Attra. The ATTRAHENS AUREM is a Small fau-shapcd muscle that aurem avises ffom the fore part of the aponeurosis of the occipito- muscie fpQj^^^i^g^ j^g fibres are directed backwards, and are inserted into a projection on the front of the rim of the ear. This is united muscle is united with the following at its origin, but a Text. cellular interval exists between them near their insertion. Beneath it are the temporal vessels. Attoi- The ATTOLLENS AUREM has the same form as the preced- lens . ^ aurem insT, though its fibres are longer and better marked. Aris- muscle. o7 o o ing also from the tendon of the occipito-frontalis, the fibres converge to their insertion into the inner or cranial surface of the pinna of the ear, — into an eminence corresponding to a fossa (that of the anti-helix) on the opposite aspect.

The posterior auricular artery and nerve are in connection with this muscle.. The occiPiTO-FRONTALis MUSCLE covcrs the arch of the Occipi- ; skull, and consists of an anterior and a posterior fleshy part, talis, with an intervening tendon. Dissection. — On the same side of the head (the left) the occipi- occipito-frontalis is to be dissected. To bring this muscle talis ', into view, a cut may be made along the middle line of the seen: skull, from the root of the nose to a little below the occipital protuberance j and this may be connected in front with the transverse incision on the side of the head. The flap of skin, thus marked out, is to be raised from before and thrown backwards; whilst doing this the dissector will meet with first the anterior fleshy part of the muscle, next a white shining thin aponeurosis, and lastly the posterior fleshy belly towards the lateral aspect of the cranium. The care to student should bear in mind that the aponeurosis of the ken. muscle is easily taken away with the granular fat superficial to it ; and should the under surface of the flap of the in- teguments that is being detached have a white instead of a yellow appearance, he may infer he is removing that apo- neurosis. The anterior or frontal part is a thin muscular expansion Frontal over the os frontis, which is not connected to the subja- ^'"^ cent bone, but mixes below with some muscles of the face. Along the line of the eyebrow (its origin) the fibres are blended with those of the orbicularis palpebrarum and cor- rugator supercilii, whilst opposite the nose they join those of the pyramidalis nasi muscle. From this attachment the fibres are directed upwards to the aponeurosis, and end in it rather below the level of the coronal suture. The posterior or occipital part is stronger than the an- occipital terior; it arises from the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and from the outer half or two-thirds of the upper curved line of the occipital bone. The fibres are about one inch and a half in length, and ascend to the aponeu- rosis. The tendon, or epicranial aponeurosis, extends over the and apo- neurosis. upper part of the cranium, and is continuous across the middle line with the same structure of the opposite half of B 2DISSECTION OF THE EXTERIOR OF THE HEAD. 4 the head. On the side it gives origin to the auricular muscles, and a thin membrane is here prolonged from it over the fascia covering the temporal muscle. Posteriorly, the aponeurosis is attached to the superior curved ridge of the occipital bone between the fleshy parts of the muscles of opposite sides. The aponeurotic expansion is closely at- tached to the skin ; but it is connected to the pericranium only by a loose connective tissue devoid of fat, so that it moves freely over the skull. Its con- Superficial to the occipito-frontalis are the cutaneous nections. ^^gg^jg ncrvcs of the scalp. In front, the muscles of opposite sides are joined above the root of the nose. How to Dissection. — After the removal of the superior auricular poraf muscles and the temporal vessels, together with the epi- cranial aponeurosis and its lateral prolongation, the attach- ment of the temporal fascia on the side of the head may be seen. Tempo. The temporal fascia is a white, shining membrane, which cta/^^' is much stronger than the epicranial aponeurosis, and gives Attach- attachment to the subjacent temporal muscle. Superiorly it ments, inserted into the curved line that limits the temporal fossa on the side of the skull; and inferiorly, where it is narrower connec- and thicker, it is fixed to the zygoma. By its cutaneous surface the fascia is in contact with the muscles already ex- amined, and with the superficial temporal vessels and nerves, and lay- An iucisiou in the fascia, a little above the zygoma, will show it to consist there of two layers, which are fixed to the margins of that process of bone. Between the layers is some fatty tissue, with a small branch of the temporal artery, and a slender twig of the orbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve. To see Dissectiou. — The temporal fascia is now to be detached muscle, from the subjacent muscle and the skull, and to be thrown down. A soft connective tissue that lies beneath it, near the zygoma, is then to be taken away. The difference in thickness of parts of the fascia will be evident. Tempo- The TEMPORAL MUSCLE is Only in part laid bare. Wide ral mus- ^^^.^ abovc, it becomcs narrower and thicker at the lower part. The muscle arises from the temporal fascia, and from all the surface of the impression on the side of the Origin, skull, that is named the temporal fossa. From this origin5 B 3 TEMPORAL MUSCLE, the fibres descend converging around a tendon, and are inserted by its means into the under surface of the coronoid l^^^""-^^^ process of the lower jaw. On the cutaneous surface is the temporal fascia, with the parts superficial to that mem- brane ; and concealed by the muscle are the deep temporal \9^^^^' vessels and nerves which ramify in it. The insertion of the muscle underneath the zygoma will be afterwards followed. Dissection.— For the dissection of the vessels and nerves ^ow to let the head be turned to the left side, and let an incision be skin oa . . right carried along the eyebrow and zygoma to a little behind the side, ear, in order that the piece of skin, on the opposite half of the head, may be removed. The fiap of integument is then to be raised from before backwards, but the subcutaneous fat should be left till the nerves are found. Behind the ear the skin should be reflected as on the other side, so as to uncover the posterior auricular vessels and nerves. Along the eyebrow seek the branches of vessels and nerves seek ° •/ nerves ' that come from the orbit, viz. the supra-orbital and frontal and ves- ^ sels in vessels, and the supra-orbital and supra-trochlear nerves, front;, They lie at first beneath the muscular fibres, and the student must cut through these to find them: the supra-orbital branches issue opposite the middle, and the supra-trochlear near the inner part of the orbit. On the side of the head, in front of the ear, the super- ""^^^^^. ficial temporal vessels and nerves are to be found; and somewhat above the zygoma are branches of the facial and superior maxillary nerves, whose offsets join. Behind the ear and below it, the posterior auricular vessels and nerve, and branches from the great auricular nerve to the tip and back of the ear, are to be seen ; one or more offsets of the last should be traced to their junction with the posterior auricular nerve. At the back of the head the ramifications of the occipital {J^^^^ vessels, with the large and small occipital nerves, should be sought out; the former nerve lies by the side of the artery, and the latter about midway between this and the ear. Cutaneous Vessels. — The arteries of the scalp are fur- J^l^^^^' nished by the internal and external carotid arteries, and scaip. anastomose freely over the side of the head. Only two small branches, the supra-orbital and frontal, come from theDISSECTION OF THE EXTERIOR OF THE HEAD. 6 former; whilst several, viz. the temporal, occipital, and pos- terior auricular arteries belong to the latter. Supra- The supra'Orbital artery leaves the orbit through the artery, notcli in the margin of the orbit, and is distributed on the forehead. Some of its branches are superficial to the occipito-frontalis, and ascend towards the top of the head, whilst others remain beneath the muscle, and supply it, the pericranium, and the bone. Frontal The frontal branch is close to the inner angle of the orbit, and is much smaller than the preceding. It soon ends in branches for the supply of the muscles, integuments, and pericranium. superfi- The superficial temporal artery is one of the terminal poraihas brauchcs of the external carotid. After ascending over the zygoma for about two inches, the vessel divides on the temporal fascia into anterior and posterior branches, anterior The anterior branch runs forward with a serpentine course to ^"^ the forehead, supplying muscular, cutaneous, and pericranial off- sets, and anastomoses with the supra-orbital artery. This is the branch that is opened when blood is taken from the temporal artery. poste- The posterior branch is larger than the other, and arches back- riorpart. ^^^^^^^g ^-^Qy^ towards the occipital artery, with which it anastomoses. Its offsets are similar to those of the anterior branch, and it communicates moreover with the artery of the opposite side over the top of the head. occipi- Occipital Artery.— The terminal part of this artery, after tery.^" perforating the trapezius, divides into large and tortuous branches, which spread over the back of the head and the occipito-frontalis muscle. Communications take place with the artery of the opposite side, with the posterior part of the temporal, and with the following artery. Some offsets pass deeply to supply the muscle, the pericranium, and the bone. Foste- The posterior auricular artery appears in front of the Scuiar." mastoid process, and divides into two branches. One (mas- toid) is directed backwards to supply the occipito-frontalis, and anastomose with the occipital artery. The other (auri- cular) is furnished to the retrahent muscle and the back of the pinna of the ear; and an offset from it pierces the pinna to be distributed on the opposite surface.CUTANEOUS VESSELS. 7 The VEINS of the exterior of the head are so similar to the veins arteries, that a full notice of each is not required. All the scaip, veins corresponding to the branches of the internal carotid artery enter the facial vein, whilst the rest open into the jugular veins. These superficial veins communicate both with the sinuses in the interior of the skull by means of small branches named emissary, and with the veins occupy- ing the spongy substance (diploe) of the cranial bones. The frontal vein is directed towards the inner angle of the orbit, like the where it receives the supra-orhital vein, the two giving rise to the angular vein of the face. Both the superficial temporal and pos- terior auricular veins open into the external jugular ; and the occz- pital'^om^ the internal jugular vein. Cutaneous Nekves.—The several nerves are furnished Nerves from the terminal parts of both the cranial and spinal nerves, scaip are The half of the head anterior to the ear receives branches from the three trunks of the fifth cranial nerve, and a few offsets from the facial nerve. All the rest of the head is supplied by spinal nerves, from both their anterior and posterior primary branches, except close behind the ear, where there is an offset of the facial (seventh cranial) nerve. The supra-orbital nerve comes from the first trunk of the ^J'PJ^f fifth nerve, and escapes from the orbit with its companion nerve; artery; whilst beneath the occipito-frontalis muscle, the nerve gives offsets to this and the orbicularis palpebrarum, as well as others to the pericranium. Finally, the nerve ends in two cutaneous branches, which ramify between the epicranial aponeurosis and the skin : — One of these (inner) soon pierces the occipito-frontalis, and its two reaches upwards as far as the parietal bone. The other branch ous^"^' (outer) is of larger size, and perforating the muscle higher up, ^g^"^^" extends over the arch of the head to the os occipitis. Whilst the nerve is escaping from the supra-orbital notch it furnishes some palpebral filaments to the upper eyelid. In the orbicular muscle a communication is established between this and the facial nerve. At the inner angle of the orbit is the small supra-trochlear branch and su- of the same nerve. It turns upwards to the forehead close to the troch- bone, and piercing the muscular fibres ends in the integument, {fj-anch. Branches are given from it to the orbicularis and corrugator supercilii, and some palpebral twigs descend to the eyelid. B 4DISSECTION OF THE EXTERIOR OF THE HEAD. 8 lary Tempo- The superficial temporal nerves are derived from the nerves; second and third trunks of the fifth nerve, and from the facial nerve. from a. The temporal branch of the superior maxillary nerve (second trunk of the fifth) is usually a slender twig, which perforates the temporal aponeurosis about a finger's breadth above the zygoma. When become cutaneous, the nerve is distributed on the temple, and communicates with the facial nerve, also sometimes with the next, ferior^' auriculo-tcmporal branch of the inferior maxillary ™axii- nerve (third trunk of the fifth) is near the ear, and accom- panies the temporal artery to the top of the head. As soon as the nerve emerges from beneath the parotid gland, it divides into two terminal branches : —the more posterior is the smaller of the two, and supplies the attrahens aurem muscle and the integument above the ear; the other branch ascends vertically to the top of the head, and is distributed over the epicranial and temporal aponeuroses. The nerve also furnishes an auricular branch (upper) to the anterior part of the ear, above the auditory meatus, and from c. The temporal branches of the facial nerve are directed nerve, upwards ovcr the temporal aponeurosis to the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle. They will be described with the dis- section of the trunk of the facial nerve. Poste- The posterior auricular nerve lies behind the ear with the ricuiar artery of the same name. It arises from the facial nerve has close to the stylo-mastoid foramen, and ascends in front of the mastoid process. Soon after the nerve becomes super- ficial it communicates with the great auricular nerve, and divides into an occipital and an auricular branch, which are distributed as their names express: — occipital The occipital branch is long and slender, and ends in the branch, p^g^gj-j^j. i^elly of the occipito-frontalis muscle. It lies near the occipital bone, enveloped in dense fibrous structure, and furnishes ofi*sets to the integuments, andauri- The auriciilar branch ascends to the back of the ear, supplying the retrahent muscle and the posterior surface of the pinna. Great The great auricular nerve of the cervical plexus is seen ?^r"^"' to some extent at the lower part of the ear, but its anatomy will be afterwards given with the description of the cervical plexus.CUTANEOUS NERVES. 9 The great occipital is the largest cutaneous nerve at the Great back of the head, and is recognised by its proximity to the ner've*^^ occipital artery. Springing from the posterior primary branch of the second cervical nerve, it perforates the muscles of the back of the neck, and divides on the occiput into numerous large offsets ; these spread over the posterior part of the occipito-frontalis muscle, ending mostly in the integument, and one small auricular branch reaches the gives an . auricu- cranial aspect oi the ear. As soon as this nerve pierces the lar trapezius, it is joined by an offset from the third cervical nerve ; and on the back of the head it communicates with the smaller occipital nerve. The small occipital nerve of the cervical plexus lies mid- smaii occipital way between the ear and the preceding nerve, and is con- nerve tinned upwards in the integuments higher than the level of the ear. It communicates with the nerve on each side, viz. the posterior auricular and great occipital. Usually this has an nerve furnishes an auricular branch to the upper part of the far"^^" ear at the cranial aspect, which supplies also the attollens aurem muscle. Dissection,—The skull is now to be opened, but before pissec- sawinsf the bone the dissector should detach on the ri«:ht open the skull. side the temporal muscle nearly down to the zygoma, with- out separating the fascia covering it; and all the remaining soft parts should be divided by an incision carried around the skull, about one inch above the margin of the orbit at the forehead, and as low as the protuberance at the occiput. The cranium is to be sawn in the same line as the precau- incision through the soft parts, but the saw is to cut only cutting through the outer osseous plate, and the inner plate is to be bon^e'^^ divided with a chisel, in order that the subjacent membrane of the brain (dura mater) may not be injured. The skull cap is next to be forcibly detached, and the dura mater will then come into view. Section II. INTERNAL PARTS OF THE HEAD. Directions,—It will be more advantageous for the student course ° to be to proceed at once with the parts described in this Section followed, than to examine the brain at this stage. Directions areDISSECTION OF THE INTERIOR OF THE HEAD. 10 given (p. 12.) for the preservation of the brain, after its re- moval, till it can be dissected. Dura The DURA MATER is the most external of the membranes mater. investing the brain. It is a strong, fibrous structure, that serves as a periosteum to the bones, and supports the Appear- cerebral mass. Its outer surface is rough, and presents, now outer it is separated from the bone, numerous small fibrous and vascular processes ; but these are most marked along the line of the sutures, vi^here the attachment of the dura mater to the bone is much the most intimate. Eamifying on the upper part of the membrane are branches of the middle meningeal vessels, ascending towards the top of the head. Small granular fibrous bodies, glands of Pacchioni, are also seen along the middle line. The number of these bodies is very variable, and is increased with age. Occasionally the surface of the skull is indented by these so-called glands. Cut' Dissection, —For the purpose of seeing the interior of the the°"^^ dura mater, divide this membrane with a scissors close to the mater, margin of the skull, except in the middle line before and be- hind where the superior longitudinal sinus lies.

The falx cerebri is the process of the dura mater, in shape like a sickle, that dips in the middle line between the he- mispheres of the cerebrum. Its form and extent will be evident if the right hemisphere is gently separated from it.

The upper border is convex, and is fixed to the middle line of the skull as far backwards as the occi- pital protuberance; and the lower, or free border, is con- cave, and turned towards the corpus callosum of the brain, with which it is in contact posteriorly. In this fold of the sinuses dura mater are contained the following sinuses :—the supe- rior longitudinal along the convex border, the inferior lon- gitudinal in part of the lower edge, and the straight sinus at the line of junction between it and the tentorium. The superior longitudinal sinus extends from the ethmoid superior bone to the occipital protuberance. Its position in the con- ^d\uti^^' vex border of the falx will be made manifest by the escape ' of blood through numerous small veins, if the finger is carried backwards along the middle line of the head. When situa- the sinus is opened, it is seen to be narrow in front, and to enaing.^ become wider as it proceeds backwards, till it ends in a com- mon point of union of certain sinuses (torcular Herophili) at the centre of the occipital bone. Its cavity is triangular its in. \ in form, with the apex of the space turned to the falx; and across it are stretched small tendinous cords—chordse Wil- lisii, near the openings of some of the cerebral veins. Oc- casionally small glandulae Pacchioni are present in the sinus. This sinus receives small veins from the substance and Veins exterior of the skull, and larger ones from the hemispheres intTu." of the brain. The cerebral veins open chiefly at the poste- rior part of the brain, and lie for some distance against the wall of the sinus before they perforate it; their course is likewise directed from behind forwards, so that the motion Current of the blood in them is evidently opposed to the direction of in it. the current in the sinus. This disposition of the veins may be seen on the left side of the brain, where the parts are undisturbed. Dissection.—Before the rest of the dura mater can be seen, Dissec- the brain must be taken from the body. To facilitate its re- remova! moval, let the head incline backwards, whilst the shoulders are raised on a block, so that the brain may be separated somewhat from the base of the skull. Cut across now the anterior part of the falx cerebri, and the different cerebral veins entering the longitudinal sinus ; raise and throw back- wards the falx, but leave it uncut behind, where it is con-DISSECTION OF THE INTERIOR OF THE HEAD. 12 nected with the rest of the dura mater. For the division of the nerves of the brain, a sharp scalpel will be necessary; and the nerves are to be cut longer on the one side than on the other. Mode of Removal of the brain, — Besrin the removal of the brain proceed- ing and bj gcutlj raising with the fingers the anterior lobes and the cut in olfactory bulbs. Next cut through the internal carotid artery succes- o sion. and the second and third nerves, which first present them- selves to the dissector; the large second nerve is on the inner, and the round third nerve on the outer side of the artery. A small branch of artery to the orbit should like- wise be divided at this time. The brain is now to be sup- ported in the left hand, and the pituitary body to be dislodged with the knife from the hollow in the centre of the sphenoid bone. Afterwards a strong horizontal process of the dura mater (tentorium cerebelli) comes into view; and along its free margin will be seen the small fourth nerve, which is to be cut at this stage of the proceeding. Next make an in- cision through the tentorium on each side, close to its at- tachment to the temporal bone, without injuring the parts underneath. The following nerves, which now appear, are to be divided in succession. Near the inner margin of the tentorium is the fifth nerve, consisting of a large and small root; whilst towards the middle line of the head is the long slender sixth nerve. Below the fifth, and somewhat external to it, is the seventh nerve with its facial and auditory parts, the former being anterior and the smaller of the two. Di- rectly below the seventh are the three trunks of the eighth nerve in one line: — of these, the upper small piece is the glosso-pharyngeal; the flat band next below, the pneumo- gastric; and the long round nerve ascending from the spinal canal, the spinal accessory. The remaining nerve is the ninth, which consists of two small pieces. After dividing the nerves, cut through the vertebral arteries as they wind round the upper part of the spinal cord. Lastly, cut across the spinal cord as low as possible, as well as the roots of the spinal nerves that are attached on each side. By placing the right first two fingers in the spinal canal, the cord may be raised, and the whole brain may then be taken readily from the skull in the left hand.

To allow the spirit to reach the interior of the ventricles, the upper part of each hemi- sphere is to be cut off nearly to the level of the corpus cal- losum; and then each lateral ventricle is to* be opened by a longitudinal incision, about two inches long, near the inner margin of the divided hemisphere, and about mid- way from before back. Now placing the brain upside down on a piece of calico long enough to wrap over it, set it aside in the spirit, together with the top of one hemi- sphere. Its examination. — At the end of one day the dissector Exami- nation of should return to the examination of the other membranes it. and the vessels. As soon as the vessels have been learnt, the membranes are to be carefully removed from all the surface of the brain, without detaching the different cranial nerves. Finally, the brain may remain in the spirit till the dissection of the head and neck has been completed. The its de- description of the brain will be found after that of the head tion. and neck. Directions,—After setting aside the brain, the anatomy of the dura mater, and the vessels and nerves in the base of the skull, should be proceeded with. Let the head be raised to a convenient height, and the tentorium be fastened in its natural position with a few stitches. The dissector should be furnished with the base of a skull, whilst studying the following parts. Dura mater,—At the base of the cranium the dura mater Dura 11 'Til I'. 1 iTciater in IS much more closely united to the bones than it is at the base of skull • top of the skull.

Occipi- A. The TORCULAR Herophili is placed in the tentorium, tre re-' oppositc the ccutro of the occipital bone. It is of an irregular ceives gj^ape, and numerous sinuses open into it; viz. the superior longitudinal above, and the occipital below; the straight and inferior longitudinal in front, and the lateral sinus on each side.SINUSES OF THE DURA IVIATER. 15 The superior longitudinal sinus has been already described superior (see p. 11.)• The inferior longitudinal sinus resembles a small vein, inferior and is contained in the lower border of the falx cerebri at d^inS!"' the posterior part. This vein receives blood from the falx and the larger brain, and ends in the straight sinus at the edge of the tentorium. The straiqht sinus lies aloner the middle of the tentorium straight ^ ^ , , sinus. and seems to continue the preceding sinus to the common point of union. Its form is triangular, like the superior longitudinal. Joining it are the inferior longitudinal sinus, the veins of Galen from the interior of the large brain, and some small veins from the upper part of the small brain. The occipital sinus is a small space in the falx cerebelli, occipi- ^ *■ tal sinus. which reaches to the foramen magnum, and collects the blood from the occipital fossae. This sinus may be double. The lateral si^ius is the channel by which most of the Lateral blood passes from the skull. There is one on each side, right and left, which extends from the occipital protuberance to the foramen jugulare, where it ends in the internal jugular vein. In this extent the sinus corresponds to the Position winding groove in the interior of the skull, between the two points of bone before mentioned. Besides small veins sinuses from the brain, it is joined by the superior petrosal sinus it!"^"^ opposite the upper border of the petrous portion of the tem- poral bone, and by the inferior petrosal at the foramen jugulare. Oftentimes it communicates with the occipital vein through the mastoid foramen, and sometimes with the veins of the diploe of the skull. The right sinus is often larger than the left. The foramen jugulare is divided into three compartments situ^- by bands of the dura mater; through the posterior interval foramen' the lateral sinus passes, through the anterior the inferior petrosal sinus, and through the central one the eighth nerve. Dissection,—To examine the cavernous sinus, say on the J^^^sec- left side, let the dura mater opposite the body of the sphenoid bone be cut through from the anterior to the posterior clinoid process, and internal to the position of the third nerve. Behind the last-named process, let the knife be directed inwards for about half the width of the basilar part of the occipital bone. By placing the handle of the scalpelDISSECTION OF THE INTERIOR OF THE HEAD. 16 OUS Sl- in the opening thus made, the extent of the space will be defined. A probe should be passed into the different sinuses that join the cavernous centre. Cavern- B. The CAVERNOUS SINUS, which has been so named from the reticulate structure in its interior, is situate on the side of the body of the sphenoid bone. This space, resulting from the separation of the layers of the dura mater, is of an irregular shape, and extends from the sphenoidal fissure to has the tip of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The nerve 1 outer piece of dura mater bounding the sinus externally is of some thickness, and contains in its substance the third and fourth nerves, with the orbital trunk of the fifth nerve. The cavity of the sinus is larger behind than before, and in it are shreds contains of fibrous tissue with small vessels. Through the space artery wiuds thc truuk of the internal carotid artery, with the sixth sixth nerve on the outer side of the vessel; but these are shut out from the blood in the space by the thin lining membrane. The cavernous sinus receives the ophthalmic vein of the orbit, some small cerebral veins, and twigs from the pterygoid and is vcius outsido the skull. It communicates with its fellow on the"foi^^^ the opposite side by the circular and transverse sinuses, and sinuses, its blood is transmitted to the lateral sinus by the superior and inferior petrosal channels. Circular The circular sinus lies around the pituitary body, and reaches from the one cavernous sinus to the other across the middle line. Besides serving as the means of communication between those sinuses, it receives small veins from the pitui- tary body. This sinus is usually destroyed by the removal of the pituitary body. Trans- The transvcrse or basilar sinus crosses the basilar process sinus, of the occipital bone^ on a level with the petrous part of the temporal bone, and joins the opposite cavernous sinuses. A second transverse sinus is sometimes found nearer the fora- men magnum. petrosal The Superior petrosal sinus lies in a groove in the upper margin of the petrous part of the temporal bone, and extends between the cavernous and lateral sinus. A small vein from the cerebellum, and another from the internal ear, are received into it. Inferior The inferior petrosal sinus extends between the same petrosal . ^ , Sinuses as the preceding, and lies m a groove along the line17 MENINGEAL VESSELS AND NERVES. of junction of the petrous part of the temporal with the basilar process of the occipital bone; it is joined hy a small vein from the outside of the skull, through the foramen lacerum (medium) at the base of the cranium. The sinus passes through the anterior compartment of the jugular foramen, and ends in the internal jugular vein. Meningeal Arteries. —The arteries supplying the dura Arteries mater and the cranium are found in the three fossae of the mater base of the skull, and may be named from their situation, anterior, middle, and posterior meningeal. The anterior meningeal are two very small branches which Anterior come from the ethmoidal arteries (p. 50.): they enter the geaL skull by apertures between the frontal and ethmoid bones, and are distributed to the dura mater near the ethmoid bone. The middle menijigeal arteries are three in number : two, Middle that are named large and small, are derived from the in- gea" "" ternal maxillary trunk; and the third is an offset of the ascending pharyngeal artery. The large meningeal branch of the internal maxillary from artery enters the skull by the foramen SpinOSUm of the maxil- sphenoid bone, and ascends towards the anterior inferior ^^^^' angle of the parietal bone. At this spot the vessel enters a deep groove in the cranium, and ends in ramifications that spread over the side of the head, some of these reaching to the top, and others towards the occiput. Two veins run with this artery. Branches.— As soon as the artery enters the cranial cavity, it gives furnishes branches to the dura mater and osseous structure, and to dura to the ganglion of the fifth nerve. One small offset, petrosal^ ^^dl r enters the hiatus Fallopii, and extends through the aqueduct of the same name till it meets the stylo-mastoid artery. One or two branches enter the orbit, and anastomose with the ophthalmic artery. The small meningeal branch is an offset of the large one smaii outside the skull, and is transmitted through the foramen gS ovale to the membrane lining the middle cranial fossa. The other meningeal branch from the ascending pharyn- from geal artery, appears in the middle fossa of the skull, after ing pha- passing through the foramen lacerum (basis cranii). rjngeai. c18 DISSECTION OF THE INTERIOR OF THE HEAD.

Both sets ramify in the posterior fossa of the skull. Nerves MENINGEAL Nerves. —The sourco of the ncrvcs of the mater, dura matcr is very uncertain. Offsets to it are derived from both the cranial and sympathetic nerves. To make these nerves apparent, it would be necessary to steep the dura mater in diluted nitric acid.* Cranial Cranial Nerves. — The Cranial nerves pass from the nerves in base of euccphalon through apertures in the base of the skull. As each leaves the cranium it is invested by processes of the membranes of the brain, which are thus disposed:—those of the dura mater and pia mater are lost on the nerve ; whilst that of the arachnoid membrane is reflected back, after a short distance, to the interior of the skull. Some of the nerves, those in the middle fossa of the skull for instance, are received into sheaths of the dura mater before they approach the foramina of transmission. For the present the nerves will be referred to as nine in number, but notice will be subsequently taken of a different mode of enumerat- ing them. only ^ Only part of the course of each nerve will be now seen, seen/ the rcst must be learnt in the dissection of the base of the brain. oifac- The FIRST NERVE cuds anteriorly in the enlargement of nerve, the olfactory bulb.

Afterwards the student should follow outwards the roots of fifth of the fifth nerve into the middle fossa of the skull, and take away the dura mater from the surface of the large Gasserian ganglion which lies on the point of the petrous part of the temporal bone. And the two large trunks that leave the front of the ganglion, viz. superior and inferior maxillary, should be traced to their apertures of exit from the skull. The THIRD NERVE is destined for the muscles of the orbit. Motor-?

Near passes to . . orbit. the orbit this nerve is joined by one or two delicate fila- ments of the cavernous plexus (p. 22.).

Fifth Nerve. — This nerve is distributed to the face and Trifacial head, and consists of two parts or roots — a large or sensory, has^two and a small or motory. The two roots of the nerve pass together through an aperture in the dura mater, into the middle fossa of the base of the skull. Immediately after- wards the larger root enters into the Gasserian ganglion, their whilst the smaller root passes beneath the ganglion, without communicating with it, and joins only one of the three trunks derived from the ganglion. The ganglion of the root of the fifth nerve (Gasserian Gasse- ganglion) is placed in a depression on the point of the petrous gan-^ part of the temporal bone. The upper surface of the gan- iarge ,DISSECTION OF THE INTERIOR OF THE HEAD. 20 glion is closely united to the dura mater, and presents a semi-lunar elevation, whose convexity looks forwards.

Next in order is the superior maxillary nerve, which leaves the skull by the foramen rotundum, and ends in the face below the orbit. And the last, or the inferior maxillary nerve, passes downwards through the foramen ovale to reach the lower jaw, the lower part of the face, and the tongue. If the gan- glion be raised, the small root will be seen passing beyond it to enter the trunk of the inferior maxillary nerve. Differ- In consequcncc of this partial blending of the roots, those the branches of the ganglion that are unconnected with the es. " smaller or motor root, viz. the ophthalmic and superior maxil- lary, are solely nerves of sensibility ; but the inferior maxil- lary, which is compounded of both, is a nerve of sensibility and motion, like a spinal nerve. It is not, however, the whole of the inferior maxillary nerve that has this double function, for the motor root is mixed almost exclusively with the part of the trunk which supplies the muscles of the lower jaw ; and it is, therefore, only that small part of the nerve which possesses a twofold action, and resembles a spinal nerve. Oph- The ophthalmic nerve is the only one of the three trunks nerveof that uccds a morc special notice in this stage of the dissec- enterr" tiou.

In this situation it is nlater. j oincd by filaments of the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic, and gives a small recurrent filament to that part of the dura mater which forms the tentorium cerebelli (Arnold).

In the sinus, the nerve is placed close against the outer side of the carotid artery ; and it is joined by one or two branches of the sympathetic nerve surrounding that vessel. Seventh Nerve.— This cranial nerve consists of two Seventh trunks, facial and auditory, and both enter the meatus audi- has two , torius internus. In the bottom of the meatus they separate ; the facial nerve courses through the aqueduct of Fallopius to the face, whilst the auditory nerve is distributed to the internal ear. Eighth Nerve.— Three trunks are combined in the Eighth eighth cranial nerve of Willis, viz. glosso-pharyngeal, has three pneumo-gastric, and spinal accessory. All three pass through the central compartment of the foramen jugulare, but all are not contained in one tube of either the dura mater or the arachnoid membrane.

On the opposite side, viz. that on which the nerves in the of sym- ^ .

One of these (cavernous) is on the artery near the root of the anterior clinoid process; and to bring it into view it will be necessary to cut off that piece of bone, and to dissect out with care the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth nerves, looking for filaments between them and the plexus. Another plexus (carotid), joining the fifth and sixth nerves, surrounds the artery as this enters the sinus. In an injected body this dissection is scarcely possible.22 DISSECTION OF THE INTERIOR OF THE HEAD. interi^ai The INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY appears in the base of artery, the skull at the apex of the petrous part of the temporal bone. In its ascent to the brain the vessel lies in the space of the cavernous sinus, along the side of the body of the winds sphenoid bone, and makes two remarkable bends, so as to cavern, look like the letter S reclined. On entering the sinus, the nus. artery ascends, at first, to the posterior clinoid process ; it is then directed forwards to the root of the anterior process of the same name; and lastly, it turns upwards internal to this point of bone, perforates the dura mater bounding the sinus, and divides into cerebral arteries at the base of the brain. In this course the artery is enveloped by nerves derived from the sympathetic in the neck. The The branches of this part of the artery are few.

Position.—previous position of the body for the ex- position amination of the base of the skull will require to be changed. The head is to be lowered, and the side of the face to be dis- sected is to be placed upwards. Dissection.—As a preparatory step, the muscular fibres Dissec- of the eyelids, lips, and side of the nose, are to be slightly stretched by inserting a small quantity of tow or cotton wool into the difierent apertures ; and the margins of the eyelids and lips are then to be fastened with a few sutures. The integument is to be removed from the left side of the How to face by means of the following incisions:—one is to be sSrT made in front of the ear, from above the zygoma to the angle of the jaw; and another is to be continued from the last point along the base of the jaw to the chin.

In the Muscles of the Face.— The superficial muscles of the face the muscles face are gathered around the apertures of the eye, nose, and the aper. mouth. An orbicular or sphincter muscle surrounds the apertures of both the eye and mouth ; and other muscles are blended with each to enlarge the opening in the centre of the fibres. There are three distinct groups of muscles : one of the opening of the eyelids ; another of the nostril; and a third of the aperture of the mouth. One of the muscles of mastication, viz. the masseter, is also now seen, but it will be afterwards examined. Muscles of the Eyelids.— The muscles of the eyelids are four in number, viz. orbicularis palpebrarum, corrugator supercilii, levator palpebrae superioris, and tensor tarsi.* The two latter are dissected in the orbit, and will be de- scribed with that part. The orbicularis palpebrarum is the sphincter muscle of the elliptical opening between the eyelids. It is a flat and thin layer, which extends from the margin of the lids beyond the circumference of the orbit. At the inner angle of the orbit the muscle is fixed to the surface and borders of the small tendo palpebrarum or tarsal ligament; above that tendon, to the nasal process of the upper maxillary bone, and to the internal angular process of the frontal bone ; and below it, to the same process of the superior maxillary bone, and to the inner part of the margin of the orbit. From this origin the fibres are directed outwards, giving rise to ovals, which lie side by side, and increase in size towards the. * The tensor tarsi muscle (p. 52.) is sometimes described as part of the orbicularis.25 MUSCLES OF THE NOSE. outer margin of the muscle. The external fibres (orbital) and con- are the strongest, and project beyond the margin of the three orbit; the internal fibres (ciliary) are very pale and thin, fibres, and form a small bundle close to the cilia or eyelashes; whilst the fibres which occupy the eyelids (palpebral), are ^^^^r- intermediate in size. The external fibres pass continuously ^'^^^j^- around the margin of the orbit; but those in the eyelids are interrupted externally, and are fixed to the external tarsal ligament and the malar bone. The muscle is subcutaneous, connec- and its circumference is free, except above, where it IS pans blended with the occipito-frontalis. Beneath the upper half of the orbicularis, as it lies on the margin of the orbit, is the corrugator supercilii muscle with the supra-orbital vessels and nerve; and beneath the lower half is part of the elevator of the upper lip. The outer fibres are sometimes joined by slips to the other contiguous muscles. The CORRUGATOR SUPERCILII is found beneath the orbi- corru- gator su- cularis, near the inner angle of the orbit. Its fibres arise perciUi from the inner part of the superciliary ridge of the frontal bone, and are directed thence outwards to join the orbi-is biend- ^ . ed with cular muscle about the middle of the orbital arch. It is orbicu- laris, a short muscle, and is distinguished by the closeness of its fibres. Muscles of the Nose, — The muscles of the nose are Four muscles the following: pyramidalis nasi, compressor naris, levator of nose, alse nasi, with some fibres that dilate the nostril, and de- pressor alse nasi. The PYRAMIDALIS NASI is a small pyramidal slip that covers Jj^g"^^" the nasal bone, and appears to be a prolongation of the occi- "^si^^^ pito-frontalis muscle.

As the fibres descend from the inner part of the orbit, the most internal are attached by a narrow slip to the is part wing of the nose, whilst the rest are blended inferiorly with of upper those of the orbicularis oris. Near its origin the muscle is partly concealed by the orbicularis palpebrarum, but in the rest of its extent it is subcutaneous; its outer border joins the elevator of the upper lip. Dilator Dilatator Naris,—In the dense tissue on the outer side of trii. ' the nostril, are found a few muscular fibres both at the fore and back part of that aperture, to which the above name has been given by Theile: they are seldom visible without anterior a Icus.

Muscles Muscles of the Mouth.— The muscles that act on the mouth, aperture of the mouth consist of a sphincter ; an elevator of the upper lip, and of the angle of the mouth; depressors of the lower lip, and of the angle of the mouth, with an elevator of the lower lip ; together with other small muscles that act on the corner, viz. zygomatici and risorius of Santorini, Lastly, the buccinator muscle may be reckoned in this set, as it acts indirectly on the corner of the mouth, sphinc The ORBICULARIS ORIS MUSCLE surrounds the external mouth opening of the mouth, and is constructed for the most part by the fibres of the several muscles acting on that aperture, consists : It consists of two parts, inner and outer, which differ much parts, in the appearance and arrangement of the fibres.MUSCLES OF THE MOUTH. 27 The inner part, whose fibres are pale in colour and fine inner or in texture, forms a rounded thick fasciculus that reaches outwards from the margin of the lip to the arch of the coro- nary artery. The fibres of this portion of the muscle are unattached to bone, and some pass from lip to lip round the corner of the mouth. The outer part is thin, wide, and more irregular in form, outer or and has an attachment to the subjacent bone, besides its con- lar!^" , nection with the adjacent muscles. In the upper lip it is attached, on each side of the middle line, by one slip (naso- labial) to the back of the septum of the nose, and by another to the outer surface of the alveolar margin of the upper jaw opposite the canine and incisor teeth, external to the depressor of the wing of the nose. And in the lower lip it is fixed on each side into the inferior jawbone, on the outer aspect, opposite the canine tooth, or external to the levator labii inferioris muscle. To see these attachments the lip must be everted, and the mucous membrane carefully raised. The inner margin of the muscle is free, and bounds the connec- aperture of the mouth ; whilst the outer edge blends with bienVs the difierent muscles that elevate or depress the lips and the other angle of the mouth. Beneath the orbicularis in each lip is "^"^ the coronary artery, with the mucous membrane and the labial glands.

By its Connec- inner side it joins the common elevator of the ala of the nose and upper lip ; and to its outer side lie the zygo- matic muscles. Beneath it are the infra-orbital vessels and nerve. The LEVATOR ANGULi ORIS has well-marked fibres, and is Elevator partly concealed by the preceding muscle.

The muscle arises from the outer origin, surface of the alveolar borders of the upper and lower maxillge, as far forward in each as the first molar tooth; and in the interval between the jaws it is attached to a band of fascia — the pterjgo-maxillary ligament. From inser- this origin the fibres are directed forwards to the angle of corners the mouth, where they mix with the other muscles and mouth, with both parts of the orbicularis ; and as some of the central fibres descend to the lower lip whilst others ascend to the upper lip, a decussation takes place at the corner of the mouth. On the cutaneous surface of the buccinator are the Parts in contact different muscles that converge to the angle of the mouth ; with it. and crossing the upper part is the duct of the parotid gland, which perforates the muscle opposite the second upper molar tooth. Internally the muscle is lined by the mucous mem- brane of the mouth, and externally it is covered by a fascia that is continued to the pharynx. By its intermaxillary origin the buccinator corresponds to the attachment of the superior constrictor of the pharynx.

The fje^ arteries are branches of the external carotid ; and the facial vein is received into the internal j ugular trunk. The facial artery emerges from the neck, and appears on Facial the lower jaw, anterior to the masseter muscle. From this point the artery ascends in a tortuous manner, near the angle of the mouth and the side of the nose, to the inner angle of the orbit, where it anastomoses with the ophthalmic artery. The course of the vessel is comparatively superficial; though course, lying in the mass of fat of the inner part of the cheek. At and con- first the artery is concealed by the platysma whilst crossing the jaw, but this thin muscle does not prevent pulsation being recognised during life; and near the mouth the large zygomatic muscle is superficial to it. The vessel rests successively on the lower jaw, buccinator muscle, elevator of the angle of the mouth, and elevator of the upper lip. Accompanying the artery is the facial vein, which is nearly a straight tube, and lies to its outer side.

A strong fascia covers the gland, and is connected above and behind to the zygoma and the cartilage of the ear, but in front is continued over the face. After the fascia has been removed, the superficial connections of the gland will appear. The great auricular nerve will be also seen ascending to the lobe of the ear. The PAROTID i^ the largest of the salivary glands; it parotid occupies the space between the ear and the lower jaw, and is named from its position. Its excretory duct enters the mouth through the middle of the cheek. The shape of the gland is irregular, and is determined irregu- somewhat by the bounding parts. Thus inferiorly, where shape; there is not any resisting structure, the gland projects into the neck, and comes into close proximity with the sub- maxillary gland, though separated from it by a process of the cervical fascia; a line from the angle of the jaw to the is lodged sterno-mastoid muscle marks usually the extent of the theTaw*^ parotid in this direction. Above, the parotid is limited by ^"'^ ' the zygoma and the temporal bone.

The duct lies between the transverse facial artery and the branches of the facial nerve, the latter being below it. A line drawn from the meatus auditorius to a little below the nostril would mark the level of the duct in the face, and the central point of the line would be opposite the opening into the mouth. The length of the duct is about two inches and its a half, and its capacity is about equal to a crow-quill, but the ind^Sze. opening into the mouth is only large enough to allow a small probe to pass.

An examination of the processes of the gland, and of the number of important vessels that are in relation with it, will demonstrate the impossibility of com- pletely removing this body, and the dangers attending any operation on it. The duct may be now opened, and a probe passed along it to the mouth to show the diminished size of its aperture. Deep Two large processes of the gland extend deeply into the Snks neck. One dips behind the styloid process, and projects jaw., beneath the mastoid process and sterno-mastoid muscle, whilst it reaches also the deep vessels and nerves of the neck.

The glandular mass is divided into numerous small forHfed lobules by intervening processes of fascia ; and each lobule consists ^-^aJ-'^^ of a set of the closed saccular extremities of the excretory duct, of the ducts, surrounded by capillary vessels. The size of these little sacs, which by their aggregation form the mass of the lobule, is about -j^QQ of an inch in diameter. From the lobules issue small ducts, which unite to form larger tubes, and finally all the ducts of the gland are collected into one.

The The cartilage of the aperture forms nearly a ring around lower cartilage the nostril; for it is bent at an acute angle in front, and sur- rounds from this point a part extends backwards on both the outer oTrpart inner sides of that aperture. The part of the cartilage, outside; that bouuds the opening externally, does not reach down- wards to the margin of the nostril, but ceases on a level with the groove on the outer aspect of the wing of the nose; it is narrow and pointed behind, but swells out in front and forms with its fellow the prominence of the apex of the another nosc.

Appen- The Appendages of the Eye consist of the eyebrow, the the eyef eyelid, and the lachrymal apparatus. Some of these can be seen now on the opposite side of the face ; but the apparatus for the tears will be dissected after the orbit has been com- pleted. Eye- The eyebrow (supercilium) is a curved eminence just above the eye, which corresponds to the orbital arch of the frontal bone. It consists of thickened integuments, and its prominence is also due to the subjacent orbicularis palpe- brarum. It i3 furnished with long coarse hairs, that are directed outwards, and towards one another. Eyelids. The eyelids are two semilunar folds in front of the eye, which are freely moveable, and can be approached over the eyeball, or can be separated so as partly to lay this bare. Upper The upper lid is the largest and the more moveable of the largest, two, and dcsccuds below the middle of the eyeball when the two meet; it is also provided with a special muscle to raise it. The interval between the open lids is named JissuraSTRUCTUKE OF THE EYELIDS. 35 palpebrarum. Externally and internally they are united by a commissure or canthus. The free margin is thicker than the rest of the lid, and is shape of semilunar in form for the greater part; but towards the inner side, or about a quarter of an inch from the commissure, it becomes straight. At the spot where these differently shaped parts join is a small white eminence, in which is the Punc- punctum lachrymale^ or the opening of the canal for the ^"""* tears. This margin is provided anteriorly with the eye- where lashes, and posteriorly with the openings of the Meibomian glands: but both the cilia and the Meibomian glands are tJfes. absent from the part of the lid which is internal to the open- ing of the lachrymal canal. The eyelashes (cilia) are two or more rows of long hairs.

Superficial to this framework is the integument, with a layer of fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum, and beneath it a mucous lining of the conjunctiva.

Orbicularis palpebrarum. — The palpebral and ciliary Layer of fibres of this muscle form the thin pale layer that occupies laris. " the eyelids. A thin stratum of connective tissue, without fat, unites the muscle with the skin. The palpebral ligament is a stratum of fibrous membrane, a fi- ^ that is continued from the margin of the orbit to join the laye"^ lower free edge of the tarsal cartilage. At the inner part of the orbit the ligament is thin and loose, but at the outer part it is much thicker and stronger.DISSECTION OF THE FACE. 36 Carti- The tarsal cartilages, one for each eyelid, give the form fofms and strength to the lids, and are of the nature of yellow or theUd. spongy cartilage. Each is fixed internally by the liga- mentum or tendo palpebrarum, and externally by a fibrous band — external tarsal ligament — to the outer part of the orbit. The margin corresponding to the edge of the lid is free, and thicker than the rest of the cartilage. On the inner surface each cartilage is lined by the mucous mem- brane or conjunctiva. Differ- The cartilages are not alike in the two lids. In the upper the two eyelid, where the cartilage is largest, it is about half an inch ' ^* wide in the centre, but gradually tapers to the ends ; and to its fore part the tendon of the levator palpebral is attached. In the lower lid the cartilage is a narrow band, about two lines broad, with borders nearly straight. Liga- Ligament or tendon of the eyelids (tendo palpebrarum, in- eye-lids ternal tarsal ligament) is a small fibrous band at the inner carti- part of the orbit, which serves to fix the lids, and is attached to the anterior margin of the lachrymal groove. It is about a quarter of an inch long, and divides into two processes, which are united one with each tarsal cartilage. This ligament gives a fibrous expansion over the lachrymal sac, and the fleshy fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum arise from it. f r^tub's '^^^ Meibomian glands or follicles are placed in grooves ^eneath on the ocular surface of the tarsal cartilages. They extend lage, parallel to one another, from the thick towards the opposite margin of the cartilage ; and their number is about thirty their in the upper, and twenty in the lower lid. The apertures ture. of the glands are at the posterior edge of the free border of the lid. Each gland is a small yellowish tube, closed at one end, and having minute lateral appendages connected with it. Each contains a sebaceous secretion, and is lined by scaly epithelium. Tendon If the palpebral ligament be cut through in the upper lid, tor pal- the tendon of the levator palpebrae will be seen to be attached to all the fore part of the tarsal cartilage by a wide aponeurotic expansion. Mucous The conjunctiva, or mucous membrane, lines the interior lid of the eyelids, where it has numerous fine papillae, and covers the anterior part of the ball of the eye. At the free margin37 EXTERNAL EAR. of the lids this membrane joins the common integument; and it is further continued down the lachrymal canals and sac to the interior of the nose. At the inner commissure of forms caruncle the eyelids the conjunctiva lorms a prominent, red, neshy- looking body — caruncula lachrymalis^ which encloses a group of mucous follicles, and has a few minute hairs on its surface. External to the caruncle is a small fold of the and the contigu- mucous membrane—plica semilunaris; this extends to the ousfold, ball of the eye, and resembles the membrana nictitans of birds. Bloodvessels of the eyelids. — The arteries of the eyelids ^"^f^Jj!^^ are furnished by the ophthalmic artery, and consist of the palpebral and lachrymal branches. The palpebral arteries^ one for each eyelid, run outwards from the inner canthus, lying between the orbicularis muscle and the tarsal cartilage, and anastomose externally with the lachrymal artery. From the arch that each forms, branches are distributed to the eyelids. The lachrymal artery perforates the palpebral ehrym'ai. ligament near the outer part of the orbit, and its offsets supply the lid, as well as anastomose with the palpebral branches. The veins of the lids open into the frontal and angular veins, veins at the root of the nose. The nerves of the eyelids are supplied from the ophthalmic ^^j- and facial nerves. The branches of the ophthalmic nerve (of the fifth) that give from offsets to the upper lid, are the following: lachrymal^ near the outer part; supra-orbital^ about the middle; and supra-trochlear and infra-trochlear at the inner side (p. 45. 48.). In the lower eye- lid, about its middle, is a branch of the superior maxillary trunk of the fifth nerve. The b^'anches of the facial nerve enter both lids at the seventh outer part, and supply the orbicularis muscle; they communicate with the branches of the fifth nerve. External Ear.—The outer ear consists of a trumpet- external shaped structure, named pinna or auricle, which collects sounds ; and of a tube — meatus auditorius, which conveys those sounds to the inner ear. The pinna may be examined on the left side of the head, but the meatus will be described with the rest of the anatomy of the ear. The pinna, or auricle of the ear, is an uneven piece of ^^^f ^"'"^ yellow cartilage, which is covered with intesfument, and is ^9"^"^ ^ ^ o 7 pinna. fixed to the margin of the meatus auditorius externus.

In the centre is a deep hollow named concha^ which conducts to the meatus auditorius. In front of that hollow is a projection of a triangular shape — the tragus, which has some hairs on the under-surface; and on the opposite side of the hollow, rather below the level of the tragus, is another projection, — the antitragus. The round, rim-like margin of the ear is called the helix, and the depression internal to it, the groove, or fossa of the helix. Within the helix, between it and the concha, is the large eminence of the antihelix, which presents at the upper part a well-marked depression, the fossa of the antihelix. Infe- riorly, the external ear is terminated by a soft, pendulous part, the lobule. Five The muscles of the pinna, which extend from one part of small , , ^ ' ^ ^ . , muscles the Cartilage to another, are very delicate, and in some bodies naiear. are not to bc found. Five small muscles are usually de- scribed, which receive their names for the most part from the several eminences of the external ear.

When the integuments tiiag?."^' are entirely taken off, the cartilage of the pinna will be ap- parent ; but in removing the integuments, the lobule of the ear, which consists only of skin and fat, will disappear.

On the posterior aspect of the concha is a strong vertical process of cartilage. In the piece of cartilage that forms the under-part of the its fis- meatus are two fissures (Santorini); one is at the base of the tragus, the other passes from before backwards. Ligaments connect the pinna with the head, but others Liga- pass from one point of the cartilage to another. "^^"^^ * The external ligaments are the condensed bands of fibrous ex- tissue that extend between the same points as the external muscles (p. 2.), though commonly only an anterior and pos- terior are described. The chief special ligament crosses special, the interval between the tragus and the beginning of the helix, and completes the tube of the meatus. The FACIAL NERVE (portio dura) is a part of the seventh outline cranial nerve, and confers motor power on the muscles of ne^ve.^^ the face. Numerous communications take place between it and the fifth nerve, and the chief of these are found above and below the orbit, and over the side of the lower jaw. i> 440 DISSECTION OF THE FACE. Dissec- Dissection, —The facial nerve is to be displayed on the nerve Tl ffht side of the face if there is time sufficient before the body is turned (see p. 1.). Some of the nerve is concealed by the parotid gland, but the greater part is anterior to the glandular mass. beyond To cxposo the ramifications beyond the parotid gland, let parotid, ^^.^ raised from the face in the same manner as on the left side. The different branches of the nerve are then to be sought as they escape from beneath the anterior border of the gland, and to be followed forwards to their termination. The highest branches that go to the temple have been already partly dissected above the zygoma ; and their junction with the temporal branch of the superior maxillary, and with the supra-orbital nerve has been seen. Other still smaller branches are to be traced to the outer part of the orbit, where they enter the eyelids and communicate with the other nerves in the lids; and by means of this set, whilst it crosses the malar bone, a junction is formed with the sub- cutaneous malar nerve of the fifth. With the duct of the parotid are two or more large branches, that are to be followed below the orbit to their junction with the infra- orbital, nasal, and infra-trochlear nerves. The remaining branches to the lower part of the face are smaller in size : one joins with the buccal nerve at the lower part of the buccinator muscle; and one or two others are to be traced forwards to the lower lip and to the labial branch of the inferior dental nerve, and of In order to trace backwards the trunk of the nerve through nerve in the gland, the integuments should be taken from the surface rotidf" of the parotid as on the other side, and the gland removed piece by piece. In this proceeding the small branches of communication of the great auricular nerve with offsets of the facial, and the branches that dip down from the facial to the auriculo-temporal nerve are to be sought. Lastly, the tip of the mastoid process may be cut off with a chisel; and after turning it backwards with the sterno-mastoid mus- cle adhering to it, the small branches of the facial nerve to the back of the ear, and to the digastric and stylo-hy- oid muscles, are to be looked for close to the base of the skull. Branch- The Nerve outside the Skull.—The nerve issues41 FACIAL NERVE OUTSIDE THE SKULL. from the sfcylo-mastoid foramen, after traversing the aque- es out- duct of Fallopius, and furnishes immediately the three fol- skuu. lowing small branches ; — The posterior auricular branch turns upwards in front of poste- the mastoid process, where it communicates with the great Ocular" auricular, and with a branch to the ear from the pneumo- gastric (eighth) nerve, and ends in auricular and mastoid offsets (p. 8.). The branch to the digastric muscle generally arises in Branch common with the next. It is distributed by many offsets gastric, to the posterior belly of the muscle near the origin. Some- times one of these offsets passes through the fleshy fibres, and descends to join the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The branch to the stylo-hyoideus is a long slender nerve, Branch that is directed inwards to its muscle, which it enters about hyS-^^" the middle. This branch communicates with the sympa- thetic nerve on the external carotid artery. As soon as the facial nerve has given off those branches, it is directed forwards through the gland, and divides near the ramus of the jaw into two large trunks—tempore-facial and cervico-facial. The TEMPORO-FACiAL TRUNK furnishcs offsets to the The up- side of the head and face, whose ramifications extend as low tr^unk as the meatus auditorius. As this trunk crosses over the external carotid artery, it sends downwards branches to join the auriculo-temporal portion of the inferior maxillary nerve, and in front of the ear it gives some filaments to the tragus of the pinna. Three sets of branches, temporal, has three malar, and infra-orbital, are derived from the ending of the branch- temporo-facial nerve. The temporal branches ascend obliquely over the zygoma xempo- to the orbicular muscle, the corrugator supercilii, and the branch- anterior part of the occipito-frontalis ; in which they arefosidSof united with offsets of the supra-orbital nerve. The attrahens aurem muscle is supplied by this set; and a junction takes place above the zygoma with the temporal branch of the superior maxillary nerve. The malar branches are directed to the outer angle of the Maiar orbit, and are distributed to the orbicularis muscle and the es go to eyelids. In the eyelids communications take place with the palpebral filaments of the fifth nerve (p. 37.); and near theDISSECTION OF THE FACE. 42 outer part of the orbit, witli the small subcutaneous malar branch of the superior maxillary nerve. Infra- The infra-Orbital branches are laro^er than the rest, and orbital p • , branch- are lumished to the muscles and the integument between lost be- the eye and mouth. Close to the orbit, and beneath the twGen eye and clcvator of the uppcr lip, a remarkable communication, — infra-orbital plexus, is found between these nerves and the infra-orbital branches of the superior maxillary. After crossing the branches of the fifth nerve, some small offsets of the facial nerve pass inwards to the side of the nose, and others upwards to the inner angle of the orbit, to join the nasal and infra-trochlear branches of the ophthalmic nerve. Lower The CERvico-FACiAL is Smaller than the other trunk, and supplies nerves to the lower part of the face and to the upper part of the neck. Its highest branches join the lowest offsets of the temporo-facial nerve, and thus complete also the network on the face. This trunk, whilst in the parotid, three givcs twigs to the gland, and is united with the great sets of branch- auricular nerve. The terminal branches that are distributed from it are, buccal, supra-maxillary, and infra-maxillary. Buccal The buccal branches pass forwards to the angle of the es to mouth, supplying the buccinator muscle, and they terminate mouth, in the orbicularis oris. On the buccinator they join the branch of the inferior maxillary nerve to that muscle. Supra- The supra-maxillary branches course inwards above the larybe- basc of the lowcr jaw to the middle line of the chin, and mouth supply the muscles and the integument between the chin ' and mouth. Beneath the depressor anguli oris the branches of the facial join offsets of the labial branch of the inferior dental nerve, in the same manner as the junction is made below the orbit; and the branches of the facial cross those of the fifth nerve in their course onwards to the middle line. Infra- The infra-maxUlary branches are placed below the jaw, laryto and are distributed to the upper part of the neck. The anatomy of these nerves will be given with the dissection of the anterior triangle of the neck (p. 62.).43 DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. Section IV. DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. Directions, —The orbit should be dissected on that side on which the muscles of the face have been seen. Position, — In the examination of the orbit, the head is Position placed in the same position as in the dissection of the sinuses body, of the base of the skull. Dissection. — In order that the contents of the orbit How to . open may be seen, it will be necessary to take away the bones the^ forming the roof of the space in the following manner : — Two cuts should be made with a saw through the margin of the orbit, one being placed at the outer, the other near the inner angle of the cavity; and these should be con- tinued backwards with a chisel, along the roof of the orbit, nearly to the optic foramen. The piece of bone included in the incisions may now be tilted forwards, but is not to be taken away. Afterwards all the rest of the roof of the orbit is to be cut away with the bone forceps, except a ring of bone around the optic foramen; and any overhanging bone on the outer side, that may interfere with the dissection, may likewise be got rid of. The dissector should take care that all the wadding is removed from the eyelids, and that the eye is pulled gently forwards. The periosteum, detached from the bone, surrounds the contents of the orbital cavity. The periosteum of the orbit is continuous with the dura Penos- mater of the brain through the sphenoidal fissure. It incases orbk. the contents of the orbit like a sac, and adheres but loosely to the bones. Apertures exist posteriorly in the membrane Aper- for the entrance of the different nerves and vessels ; and on it. the sides prolongations of the membrane accompany the vessels and nerves that leave the cavity.

The lachrymal nerve may remain uncut. Elevator The LEVATOR PALPEBR^ SUPERIORIS is the most Superficial of upper eyelid musclc, and is attached posteriorly to the roof of the orbit in front of the optic foramen. The muscle widens as it ex- tends forwards, and in front of the eyeball it turns down- 3s at- wards, and is inserted by a wide tendon into the fore part of to tarsal the tarsal cartilage. By one surface the muscle is in con- [age[ tact with the frontal nerve and the periosteum ; and by the is high- other, with the superior rectus muscle. If it is cut across cie in"^' about the centre, a small branch of the third nerve will be seen entering the under surface. Upper The RECTUS SUPERIOR is the upper of the four muscles muscle: that lie around the globe of the eye. It arises from the Origin, uppcr part of the optic foramen, and is connected with the other recti muscles around the optic nerve.

To see the synovial membrane and the tendon, this pro- longation must be cut away. Dissection.—The superior rectus muscle is next to be Dissec- divided about the middle, and turned backwards, when a branch of the third nerve to its under surface will be found. The nasal nerve and the ophthalmic artery and vein will be now seen crossing inwards above the optic nerve: these should be traced forwards to the inner angle, and backwards to the posterior part of the orbit. By taking away some of To find the fat between the optic nerve and the external rectus, at cuiar the back of the orbit, the small lenticular ganglion and its gnon. branches will be discovered : the student will find the ciliary branches, that lie along the side of the optic nerve, the best guide to the situation of the ganglion. The dissector should then find the branches from the nasal and third nerves to the ganglion. And, lastly, he should separate from one another the nasal, third, and sixth nerves, as they enter the orbit between the heads of the external rectus muscle. The THIRD NERVE is placed highest in the wall of the Third cavernous sinus ; but at the sphenoidal fissure it descends "^^^^ below the fourth, and two branches (frontal and lachrymal) of the ophthalmic nerve. The nerve enters the orbit as it between the heads of the outer rectus, having previously orb?t? divided into two parts.

The nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve enters the orbit Nasai between the heads of the rectus, and lies between the two parts of the third nerve.

Lenticu- The OPHTHALMIC Or LENTICULAR GANGLION is a Small glior?."" roundish body, of the size of a pin's head, and of a reddish situa- colour. It is placed at the back of the orbit, between the optic nerve and the external rectus, and commonly on the Connec- outcr sidc of the ophthalmic artery. By its posterior part the tions. ganglion has branches of communication with other nerves (its roots); and from the anterior part proceed the ciliary struc. nerves to the eyeball. In the ganglion, sensory, motory, and sympathetic filaments are combined. Three T^l® offsets of communication are three in number. One, the long ' ^^^^ branch of the nasal nerve before noticed, which joins the superior angle. A second branch of considerable thick- short ^6ss {short root) passes from the inferior angle to join the branch of the third nerve that supplies the inferior oblique muscle. AndTHE OPHTHALMIC ARTERY. 49 the third root is derived from the sympathetic (the cavernous p^^j^^J^^- plexus), either as a distinct branch to the posterior border of the ganglion or in union with the long root. Branches, — The short ciliary nerves are ten or twelve in Ciliary number, and are collected into two bundles, which leave the upper ^Z^to^^' and lower parts (superior and inferior angles) of the ganglion. In ^y^^^"- the upper bundle are four or five, and in the lower, six or seven nerves. As they extend along the optic nerve to the eyeball they occupy the outer and under parts, and communicate with the long ciliary branches of the nasal nerve. The OPHTHALMIC ARTERY is a branch of the internal caro- Oph- • r» A thalraic tid, and enters the orbit through the optic loramen. At artery first the vessel is outside the nerve, but it then courses inwards, over or under the nerve, to the inner angle of the in orbit, orbit, where it ends in terminal branches.

It supplies branches, supplies like the nerve, to the lachrymal gland and the conjunctiva; and it anastomoses with the middle meningeal and deep temporal arteries, by offsets through the sphenoidal fissure and the outer wall of the orbit. h.

Eth- ^ f. The ethmoidal branches are two, anterior and posterior, which branch- pass through the two foramina in the inner wall of the orbit. The posterior is the smaller of the two, and furnishes small meningeal Poste- offsets (anterior) to the dura mater of the base of the skull. The nor and , ^ . i • im • anterior, anterior branch accompanies the nasal nerve, and gives likewise small meningeal offsets to the dura mater. Both send branches to the nose through the apertures in the cribriform plate of the eth- moid bone. Branch- g. The palpebral branches^ one for each eyelid, generally arise eyeHds. together opposite the pulley of the superior oblique muscle, and then separate from one another. The arches they form have been dissected with the eyelids (p. 37.).

The frontal branch turns round the margin of the orbit, and is distributed on the forehead (p. 6.). The ophthalmic vein corresponds in its course and most of its branches to the artery of the same name. It begins at the inner angle of the orbit, where it joins the facial vein, and receives tributary branches in its progress to the back of the cavity. Posteriorly, it leaves the artery, and escapes cavernt ^^^^ orbit by the sphenoidal fissure, betv^een the heads ous si- Qf external rectus. It ends in the cavernous sinus. nus. Optic The OPTIC NERVE can now be seen to extend from the "^^''^ optic foramen to the back of the eyeball. As the nerve enters the foramen, it is surrounded by the recti muscles; and beyond that spot, as far as the eyeball, the ciliary ar- teries and nerves entwine around it. It terminates in the retinal expansion of the eye. Dissec- \ Dissection.—Take away the ophthalmic artery, and divide the optic nerve about its middle, together with the small ciliary vessels and nerves. Turn forwards the eyeball, and fasten it in that position with hooks. On removing some fat, the three recti muscles — inner, outer, and inferior; and the lower branch of the third nerve will appear. The lower branch of the third nerve supplies three muscles ends in retina. tion,RECTI MUSCLES. 51 in the orbit. Whilst entering this space between the heads of branch the external rectus, it lies below the nasal, and rather above nerve is the sixth nerve. Almost immediately afterwards the nerve lar, divides into three branches. One of these enters the in- ternal rectus; another the inferior rectus; and the third, the longest and most external branch, is continued forwards to the inferior oblique muscle. Soon after its origin the last nerve communicates with the lenticular ffanfflion, form- ^^r gan. ^ ^ ^ ghon. ing the short root of that body, and furnishes two or more filaments to the inferior rectus. The SIXTH NERVE enters the orbit between the heads of sixth the external rectus, below the other nerves in that interval, enter^s and above the ophthalmic vein. In the orbit it is distributed recS"^ to the external rectus muscle. Recti Muscles. — The internal, inferior, and external straight rectus muscles are placed with reference to the eyeball as ™f"eye-^ their names express. They arise posteriorly from the cir- ofi'gin. cumference of the optic foramen by a common attachment, that partly surrounds the optic nerve. But the external rectus differs from the others in having two heads ; an upper which joins the superior rectus ; and a lower and larger one that blends with the inferior rectus, and is attached to a bony point on the lower border of the sphenoidal fissure, near to the inner end : some muscular fibres are also con- nected with a tendinous band between the heads. The mus- i^ser- cles are directed forwards, and have a tendinous insertion into the ball of the eye, about a quarter of an inch from the cornea. Between the heads of origin of the external rectus, the different nerves before mentioned enter the orbit, viz. the third, the nasal branch of the fifth, and the sixth, to- gether with the ophthalmic vein.

To dissect obUquJ. out the inferior oblique muscle, let the eyeball be replaced in its natural position ; then by taking away the conjunctival lining of the lower eyelid near the inner part, and removing some fat^ the muscle will appear beneath the eyeball, bending from the inner to the outer side. The inferior oblique muscle is situate near the anterior Lower margin of the orbit, and differs from the other muscles in muscle, the circumstance of its course being directed across, insteadDISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. 52 Origin, of parallel to the axis of the orbit.

From this spot the muscle passes outwards beneath the inferior rectus, and inser- between the eyeball and the external rectus, to be in- serted into the sclerotic coat, between the last muscle and the superior rectus. The borders of the muscle look forwards and backwards, and the posterior receives the connec- branch of the third nerve. The tendon of insertion is near that of the superior oblique muscle, but rather closer to the optic nerve. Seek Dissection, — To expose the small tensor tarsi muscle, the tarsi. palpebral ligament attaching the eyelids to the margin of the orbit must be cut through, where this has not been done; but the lids must be left connected at the inner commissure by means of the tendo palpebrarum. By look- ing to the posterior aspect of the tendinous band attaching the tarsal cartilages, after the lids have been placed across the nose, the pale fibres of the tensor tarsi will be seen. Tensor The TENSOR TARSI MUSCLE arises from the ridge on the muscle, unguis, and slightly from the bone behind the ridge. Its fibres are pale, and form a very small flat band, behind the ligamentum palpebrarum, which divides like that structure Inser, into a slip for each eyelid. In each eyelid the slip lies on the lachrymal canal, and blends with the other muscular fibres at the free margin of the tarsal cartilage. Trace Dissection.—A. small nerve, the orbital branch of the su- superior pcrior maxillary trunk, lies in the outer angle of the floor lary^' of tho orbit, and will come into view by the removal of the ^^^"^ eyeball and its muscles. This nerve is very soft and easily broken. Two branches, temporal and malar, are to be traced forwards from it: and a filament of the lachrymal nerve is to be followed to its junction with the former. The outer wall of the orbit may be cut away, bit by bit, to follow the tem- poral branch through to the surface of the head. Orbital The orMtal branch of the superior maxillary nerve arises of supe- in the spheno-maxillary fossa, and enters the orbit by the maxii- fissure of the same name. At the back of the orbit the nerve; ncrve dividcs into malar and temporal branches, which ramify in the face and the side of the head, its malar a. The malar branch (r. subcutaneus malse) is directed forwardsLACHRYIVIAL APPARATUS. 53 along the floor of the orbit, and through a foramen in the malar bone to the face. After emerging from its foramen, this branch supplies the orbicularis, and communicates with the facial nerve. h. The temporal branch ascends on the outer wall of the orbit, ^^^J^"^- either beneath the periosteum, or in a groove in the bone, and branch- being joined by a filament from the lachrymal nerve, passes into the temporal fossa through a foramen in the malar bone. The nerve is then directed upwards between the temporal muscle and the bone, and perforates the temporal fascia near the orbit. Its distribution has been seen in the examination of the cutaneous nerves of the head (p. 8.). Lachrymal Apparatus.—The lachrymal gland and ducts, Appara- w^ith the puncta, canals, and sac, constitute the apparatus by the which the tears are formed and conveyed to the nose. The gland has been already described (see p. 44.). Dissection.— Some bristles should be introduced into the Dissec-; lachrymal canals through the puncta of the eyelids that still remain in their natural place. The lachrymal sac v^ill appear by removing the tensor tarsi and the connective tissue from its surface, as it lies on the os unguis. The prolongation from the tendo palpebrarum over the sac should likewise be prepared. The puncta lachrymalia are two small apertures, one for Aper- each lid, by which the tears enter the lachrymal canals, eyelids. Each is situate in the free margin of the lid, about a quarter of an inch from the inner canthus, and in the elevation of the papilla lachrymalis. The lachrymal canals are two small tubes that reach Canais from the puncta, and convey the tears to the lachrymal sac; tears, their situation is marked by the bristles that have been in- serted in them. In their course inwards, the canals lie along the tendo-palpebrarum, one above and the otner beiow it^ and they are somewhat arched with the concavity towards the tendon. Internally, they open near together into the lachrymal sac rather above its middle. The canal in the Differ- upper eyelid is longer and more arched than that in the the two lower lid. The lachrymal sac and duct extend from the inner part of Recep- ., , . tacle of tiie orbit to the nose, and convey the tears into the latter the tears, cavity. They form one tube, of which the upper dilated part is the sac, and the lower constricted end the duct.54 DISSECTION OF THE NECK. The sac is situate in the hollow formed by the os unguis and nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. Externally, it is crossed by the ligament or tendon of the eyelids, and is covered by an expansion, derived from that tendon, which is fixed to the margins of the bony groove. If the aponeu- rotic covering be removed, the mucous membrane lining the interior will be seen. Into the outer side of the sac the lachrymal canals open. The duct (ductus ad nasum) is the narrowed part of the tube, that reaches to the nose. It is entirely encased by bone ; and in length, size, and direction, it corresponds with the passage of the same name in the dried skull. In the nasal cavity it opens into the front of the inferior meatus, and a bent probe introduced through the nostril may be readily passed into it from that meatus. Ana- The examination of the eyeball must be made on the eyebau frcsh cyc of either the ox or the sheep; but this part may be wards. Omitted with more advantage to the student till the dissection of the head and neck has been completed. The eyeball is described at the end of the book. Section V. DISSECTION OF THE NECK. Position Position, — For the dissection of the right side of the neck part. let the head be supported at a moderate height, and let the face be turned to the left side, and fastened in that position with hooks. To obtain a good view of the neck, the right arm should be drawn under the body, so that the point of the shoulder may be depressed, and the parts put on the stretch. Bounda- Surface-marking.—The side of the neck presents a some- theside what Square outline, and is limited in the following way : — Inferiorly is the prominence of the clavicle, and superiorly is the base of the lower jaw with the skull. In front its boundary is marked by a line from the chin to the sternum, and behind, by another line from the occiput to the acromial Division ^nd of the clavicle. The part thus marked out is divided triangles i^to two triangular spaces (anterior and posterior) by masS? the diagonal position of the sterno-mastoid muscle.

The surface in front of the sterno- mastoid is depressed at the upper part of the neck, near the position of the carotid vessels ; and behind the muscle, near the clavicle, is another slight hollow, which points to the situation of the subclavian artery. Along the middle line of the neck the following parts can Promi. be recognised through the skin : — About two inches and a the mid- half from the base of the jaw is the eminence of the os of neck,, hjoides, with its cornu extending laterally on each side. Below this may be felt the wide prominence of the thyroid cartilage, called pomum Adami, which is most marked in the man; and between the cartilage and the hyoid bone is a slight interval corresponding to the thyro-hyoid membrane. Inferior to the thyroid, is the narrow prominent ring of the cricoid cartilage ; and between the two the finger may distinguish another interval, which is opposite the crico- thyroid membrane. From this spot to the sternum, and be- and supra- tween the sterno-mastoid muscles, is a depression, whose sternal > depres- depth is much increased in emaciated persons, in which the sion. tube of the trachea can be felt. In some bodies, especially in women, the swelling of the thyroid gland may be per- ceived by the side of the upper part of the trachea. Direction. —As the time will not allow now the examina- tion of the whole side of the neck, the student should lay bare in this stage only the parts behind the sterno-mastoid muscle. Dissection. — To raise the integuments from the posterior pissec- triangle of the neck, and from the structures immediately the pia- connected with it, the skin may be divided along the sterno- mastoid from the one end to the other, and afterwards along the clavicle as far as the acromion. The triangular flap of skin is to be reflected from before back towards the trapezius muscle. The superficial fascia, which will then be brought into view, contains the platysma; and to see that muscle, it will be necessary to take the subcutaneous fat from its surface. The PLATYSMA MYOIDES is a thin subcutaneous muscular piatys- layer, which is now seen only in its lower half. The Se."^""" muscle is placed across the side of the neck, and extends £ 4DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 56 arises at from the top of the shoulder to the face. Its fibres take der s origin from the clavicle and the acromion, and below these bones from the fascia covering the pectoral and deltoid muscles ; and then ascend over the side of the neck, to be inserted inserted into the jaw. The lower part of the muscle is "^^^J^^' more closely united to the skin than the upper, and covers the external jugular vein as well as the lower part of the covers postcrior triangle. At first the fibres of the muscle are thin triangle. i i i • and scattered, but they increase in strength as they ascend. The oblique direction of the fibres should be noted, because in venesection in the external jugular vein the incision is to be so made as to divide them across. Dissec- Dissection.—The platysma is now to be cut across near the clavicle, and to be reflected upwards as far as the inci- sion over the sterno-mastoid muscle, but it is here to be left attached. In raising the muscle the student must be careful of the deep fascia of the neck ; and should dissect out the external jugular vein, and the superficial descending branches of the cervical plexus, which are close beneath it. Exter- The external jugular vein commences in the parotid iSHein" gland (p. 32.), and is directed backwards between the pla- tysma and the deep fascia to the lower part of the neck, where it pierces the fascia to open into the subclavian vein, crosses Its coursc dowu the neck will be marked by a line from the neck to angle of the jaw to the middle of the clavicle. The part of vTanl^ the vein now seen is joined by small superficial branches, and an ofi'set connects it with the anterior jugular vein. Its size, and the height at which it crosses the sterno-mastoid muscle, are very uncertain. Cervical The deep cervical fascia consists, like the aponeuroses in fascia, ^^i^gp regions of the body, of a superficial layer that sur- rounds the part continuously, and of processes that are pro- longed inwards between the muscles. In some bodies this fascia is thin and indistinct. In its extent round the neck the membrane incases the sterno-mastoideus, and presents a Part be- difierent disposition before and behind that muscle. As now sterno- sccu passing backwards from the muscle, the fascia continues muscle, over the posterior triangular space, and then encloses the trapezius, in its progress to the spines of the vertebrae. At the lower part of the neck the fascia is attached to the clavicle, and is perforated by the external jugular vein, and57 POSTERIOR TRIANGULAR SPACE. the cutaneous nerves. After tlie superficial layer has been sends a process removed near the clavicle, a deep process may be observed beneath ^ ^ T clavicle. to envelop the small omo-hyoid muscle, and to extend under the clavicle, where it is fixed to the back of that bone, and to the inner end of the first rib. Dissection.—By the removal of the cervical fascia and the Dissec- *' . . tion of fat from the space between the sterno-mastoid and trapezius J^j.^"su- muscles, the posterior triangle of the neck will come into space, view. Crossing the space obliquely about an inch above the clavicle, and thus dividing it into two, is the small omo-hyoid muscle. Above the omo-hyoid muscle will be found the ramifica- Nerves above tions of the branches of the cervical plexus, together with omo-hy- the spinal accessory nerve; the latter will be recognised by its piercing the sterno-mastoid muscle: the greater number of the branches of the cervical plexus descend to the shoulder, but the small occipital and great auricular nerves ascend to the head, whilst the superficial cervical branch is directed forwards over the sterno-mastoid muscle. Below the omo-hyoideus are the subclavian artery and the ^eiow^ brachial plexus, which have a deep position. In this part also the following vessels and nerve are to be sought, viz. the supra-scapular vessels behind the clavicle; the transverse cervical vessels beneath the omo-hyoid muscle ; and, lastly, the small branch of nerve to the subclavian muscle, whichtri- angular lies about the middle of the space between the clavicle and space, the omo-hyoideus. POSTERIOR TRIANGULAR SPACE. This space, having the form and position before noted, is Poste- about eight inches in length, and contains the cervical and angular brachial plexuses, the portion of the subclavian artery the neck, on which a ligature is usually placed, together with other smaller vessels and some ofi*sets of the nerves. It is bounded in front by the sterno-mastoid muscle, and behind by the Bounda- trapezius. Its base corresponds to the middle third of the clavicle, and its apex is at the skull. In the area of the space are several muscles, which are to be recognised in the following order from above down, viz., splenius capitis, levator anguli scapulas, and middle and posterior scalenus; and at the lower and outer angle, somewhat beneath the58 DISSECTION OF THE NECK. trapezius, is the upper part of the serratus magnus. Co- vering the space, are the structures already examined, viz. the skin and superficial fascia, the platjsma over the lower is di- half or more, and the deep fascia. The small omo-hyoid by omo- musclc crosscs the lower part of the space, so as to subdivide eus. it into two,—a lower or clavicular, and an upper or occipital. Part The clavicular part is small in size and close to the cla- near cla- ^ ^ vicie. vicle, and contains the subclavian artery. It is triangular in form, with its base directed forwards ; and is bounded in front by the sterno-mastoid, above by the omo-hyoid muscle, and below by the clavicle. This small space measures commonly about one inch and a half from before backwards, and somewhat less in front at its base. Vessels Crossing the area of this part of the space, rather above nerves the Icvcl of the claviclc, is the trunk of the subclavian in this part, artery (the third part), which issues from beneath the ante- rior scalenus muscle, and is directed over the first rib to the axilla. Above the artery are the large cords of the brachial plexus, which accompany the vessel, and become closely ap- and their plied to it beneath the clavicle. Beneath the artery and relative ^ ^ ^ position the nerves are the middle scalenus muscle and the first rib. Along the clavicular side of the space, and rather beneath the clavicle, are the supra-scapular vessels ; and crossing the upper angle, at the meeting of the omo-hyoid and sterno- mastoid muscles, are the transverse cervical vessels. En- tering the space from above is the external jugular vein, which descends over or under the omo-hyoideus near the anterior part, and opens into the subclavian vein ; in this spot the vein receives the supra-scapular and transverse cervical branches, and sometimes a small vein, over the clavicle, from the cephalic vein of the arm. varia- The sizc of the clavicular part of the posterior triangular the size spacc is influenced by the extent of the attachment of the of the ^ space; trapezius and sterno-mastoid muscles along the clavicle, since in some bodies these muscles occupy nearly the whole length of the bone. The space may be farther increased or diminished by the position of the omo-hyoideus in the neck ; for this muscle may lie close to the clavicle, being attached thereto, or it may be distant one inch and a half from that also in bonc. In depth the space varies naturally ; and in a short depth, thick neck, with a prominent clavicle, the artery is farther59 BRANCHES OF CERVICAL PLEXUS. from the surface than in the opposite condition of the parts. ^^'Jjj^"*' But the depth is altered much more by the position of tlie ^^^l^j^'^*^- clavicle, according as the limb is raised or depressed; for the arm and shoulder may be carried upwards until the collar bone rises above the level of the omo-hyoid muscle, and entirely conceals the artery in its usual position. The situation of the trunk of the subclavian artery may Depar- vary much, for it may be one inch and a half above the cla- from the vicle, or at any point intermediate between this and its state of usual level, just above the prominence of that bone. Fur- seis. ther, its position to the anterior scalenus may be altered; and instead of the vessel being beneath, it may be in front of, or even between the fibres of that muscle. Commonly there is not any branch connected with the artery in this part of its course; but the posterior scapular branch may take origin from it at different distances from the scalenus, or there may be more than one branch (Quain). In the or- dinary disposition of the vessels the subclavian vein is not seen, owing to its situation being lower down, beneath the clavicle; but it not unfrequently rises upwards as high as the artery, or it may even lie with the artery beneath the an- terior scalenus in some rare instances. The position of the external jugular vein with regard to the subclavian artery is very uncertain, and the branches connected with its lower end may form a kind of plexus over the arterial trunk. The occipital part of the posterior triangular space is of Part of larger extent than the other. Its boundaries in front and fai-^"^" behind are the sterno-mastoid and the trapezius, and it is near^the head separated from the clavicular portion by the omo-hyoid muscle. In it are contained chiefly the ramifications of the contains cervical plexus; and a chain of lymphatic glands lies along anZ^^ the sterno-mastoid muscle. Beneath the spinal nerves is the middle scalenus, and still farther behind are some muscles of the back before seen. The spinal accessory nerve is directed also spi- obliquely across this interval from the sterno-mastoid mus- cessory cle, which it pierces, to the under-surface of the trapezius ; and a communication takes place between this cranial nerve and the spinal nerves in the triangular space. Superficial Branches of the Cervical Plexus. — ^fTh^^^ Behind the sterno-mastoid muscle appear some of the rami- cervicalDISSECTION OF THE NECK. 60 plexus . fications of the cervical nerves in the plexus of the same name, and superficial branches are furnished from these both upwards and downwards. that as- A.

The head and neck may be detached from ned!^^ the trunk, supposing the thorax to be finished, by dividing the spinal column between the second and third dorsal vertebrae. By this step the student obtains the clavicles and the first ribs, and preserves the natural position of the parts at the root of the neck: he should moreover be careful to take the arch of the aorta. Position.—After the part has been detached, the face is position to be turned to the left away from the dissector, and a small ^^p^"^^' narrow block is to be placed beneath the neck; the neck is to be made tense by means of hooks, the chin being well raised at the same time.

At the jaw. base of the jaw they are inserted between the symphysis and the masseter muscle, while other and more posterior fibres are continued over the face, joining the depressor anguli oris and risorius, as far as the fascia covering the parotid gland, or the cheek bone. Below the chin the fibres of opposite muscles cross for the distance of about an inch, but those that are superficial do not belong always to the same side. This part of the muscle is superficial, and conceals the following nerves: — Superfi- The superficial cervical nerve has been traced from its vicai^^"^ origin in the cervical plexus to its position superficial to the ^^'^^^' fascia of the neck (p. 60.); and the nerve may arise from the plexus by two pieces.

The descending branch likewise passes through the platysma, and is distributed below the preceding, reaching as low as the sternum. Dissec- Dissection. — Raise the platysma to the base of the jaw, and dissect out the cervical branches of the facial nerve that are beneath it. Clean also the deep fascia of the neck. Branch- The infra-maxUlary branches of the facial or seventh faclL cranial nerve (rami subcutanei colli) (p. 42.) pierce the theneck. deep cervical fascia, and pass forwards beneath the platysma, forming arches across the side of the neck, which reach as low as the hyoid bone. Most of the branches end in the platysma, but a few filaments perforate it and supply the integument. Beneath the muscle there is a communicationCERVICAL FASCIA. 63 established between these branches of the facial and the offsets of the superficial cervical nerve. The part of the deep cervical fascia in front of the sterno- cervical mastoideus is stronger than it is behind that muscle, and f?onTof has the following disposition. Near the sternum the fascia mSxll^ forms a white firm membrane, which is attached to that bone; but higher in the neck it becomes thinner, and is fixed to the lower jaw and the zygoma, covering also the parotid gland. From the angle and ramus of the jaw a piece is prolonged downwards, between the parotid and sub- maxillary glands, to join the styloid process; this piece is forms named stylo-maxillary ligament. Intermuscular partitions maxii- are sent between the muscles; and the layer beneath the ment^ sterno-mastoid is connected with the sheath of the cervical sheath of vessels. One of these strata, viz. that beneath the sterno- thyroid muscle, descends in front of the great vessels at the root of the neck to the arch of the aorta and the pericardium. Dissection. — To define the anterior triangular space, take d^^^^^, away the deep fascia of the neck, and clean the surface ^ ' anterior of the hyoid muscles that appear along the middle line, t"angie. dissecting out at the same time the anterior jugular vein. Next, the parts that occupy the anterior triangle are to be brought into view by taking away the fat and fascia, but without displacing or injuring them. In removing the seek a sheath from the cervical vessels, as these appear from n?rve. beneath the muscles at the lower part of the neck, the dissector should be careful of the small descending branch of the hypo-glossal nerve in front of it. In the sheath between the vessels (carotid artery and jugular vein) will be found the pneumo-gastric nerve, and behind the same, the sympathetic nerve. The trunks into which the artery Trace bifurcates are to be followed upwards, especially the more ^''^^"^^ superficial one (external carotid), whose numerous branches are to be traced as far as they lie in the space. Crossing the space, in the direction of a line from the mastoid process and to the hyoid bone, are the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles ; and lying below them is the hypo-glossal nerve, which gives one branch (descendens noni) in front of the sheath, and another to the thyro-hyoid muscle. Directed downwards and backwards from beneath the same muscles to the sterno-mastoideus, is the spinal accessory nerve. On the Laryn-64 DISSECTION OF THE NECK. nlfves ^^^^^ vessels, between the hjoid bone and the thyroid cartilage, the dissector will find the superior laryn- geal nerve; and with the descending part of the superior thyroid artery, its small external laryngeal branch. Clean Lastly, clean the submaxillary gland close to the base of feek^' j^w; and on partly dislodging it from the surface of the J^^yYo! mylo-hyoid muscle, the student will expose the small branch hyoid. nerve to that muscle with the submental artery. The interval between the jaw and the mastoid process is supposed to be cleaned by the removal of the parotid gland in the dissection of the facial nerve. ANTERIOR TRIANGULAR SPACE. Trian- This spacB coutaius the carotid vessels and their branches, spice in with many nerves, and corresponds with the hollow on the neck. surface of the neck in front of the sterno-mastoid muscle. Bounda- Its limits are the following: — behind is the sterno-mastoid muscle; and in front a line, from the chin to the sternum, along the middle of the neck. Above, at the base of the space, would be the lower jaw, with a line prolonged from it to the sterno-mastoideus; and below, at the apex, is the sternum. Over this space are placed the skin and super- ficial fascia, the platysma, the deep fascia, and the ramifica- tions of the facial and superficial cervical nerves. In the area of the triangular interval, as it is above defined, are seen the larynx, and many muscles converging towards the hyoid bone as a centre, some being above and some below it. Below are the depressors of that bone, viz. omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid; and above, the elevators of the bone, viz. mylo-hyoid, and digastric and stylo-hyoid. Connected with the back of the hyoid bone and the larynx are some of the constrictor muscles of the gullet. Carotid The carotid blood-vessels occupy the hinder and deeper artery in ii.ini space, part 01 the space along the side oi the sterno-mastoid muscle, Course, and their course would be marked on the surface by a line from the sterno-clavicular articulation to a point midway Cover- between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process. As high as the level of the cricoid cartilage, the vessels are co- vered by the depressor muscles of the os hyoides ; but beyond that they are concealed by the common coverings of the space, and by the sterno-mastoid muscle which, before the65 ANTERIOR TRIANGULAR SPACE. parts are displaced, overhangs or conceals the vessels — in some bodies to a level with the hyoid bone, and in others as far as the parotid gland. For a short distance after its exit from beneath the mus- Bifurca. cles at the root of the neck, the common carotid artery re- mains a single trunk, but opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage it divides into two large vessels, external and internal carotid. From the place of division these trunks are continued onwards, beneath the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, to the interval between the jaw and the mastoid process. At first the trunks lie side by side, the ^^l]^'^^ vessel destined for the internal parts of the head beinff the trunks ^ , ^ to one more posterior of the two, but above the digastric muscle another, one becomes superficial to the other. The more superficial artery (external carotid) furnishes many branches to the Branch- neck and the outer part of the head, viz. some forwards to the larynx, tongue, and face; others backwards to the oc- ciput and ear; and others upwards to the head. The deeper trunk (internal carotid) ascends to the head without branch^ ing, and is distributed to the interior of the skull. But the common carotid does not always divide, as here changes said, for it sometimes ascends as an undivided trunk (though place of very rarely), furnishing offsets to the neck and head. Or of caro- the point of branching of the vessel may be moved from the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, either upwards or downwards, so that the trunk of the carotid may remain undivided till it is beyond the os hyoides, or end in branches opposite the cricoid cartilage. The division beyond the usual place is more frequent than the branching short of that spot. In close contact with the outer side of both the Jugular common trunk and the internal carotid artery, is the large internal jugular vein, which receives branches in the neck corresponding to some of the branches of the superficial artery; but in some cases the vein covers the artery, and alters the branches joining it above may form a kind of plexus over the upper part of the common arterial trunk. In connection, more or less intimate, with the large ves- Nerves sels, are the following nerves: in front of the sheath is n^ct'ion the descending branch of the hypo-glossal nerve ; within the art?r£^ sheath, between the carotid artery and jugular vein, is the pneumo-gastric nerve; and behind the sheath is the sympa- F 166 DISSECTION OF THE NECK. thetic nerve. Crossing over the vessels, so as to form an arch below the digastric muscle, is the hypo-glossal nerve, which gives downwards its branch (descendens noni) most commonly in front of the sheath. Along the outer part of the vessels the spinal accessory nerve extends for a short distance, till it pierces the sterno-mastoid muscle. And on the inner side of the internal carotid artery, opposite the hyoid bone, the superior laryngeal nerve appears; whilst a little lower down, with the descending branches of the thy- roid artery, is the external laryngeal branch of that nerve. Appearing also on the inner side of the two carotid arteries, close to the base of the space, is the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which courses forwards between them. Glands: Two glandular bodies, the submaxillary and thyroid, have iiiary ' their seat in this triangular space of the neck. Altogether in front of the vessels, and partly concealed by the jaw, is the submaxillary gland; and beneath it on the surface of the mylo-hyoideus is the small nerve to that muscle, with and thy- the submental artery. By the side of the thyroid cartilage, body, between it and the common carotid artery, is the thyroid body, which is covered by the sterno-thyroid muscle: in the female this body is much more strongly marked than in the male. Parotid At the base of the space, if the parts were not disturbed, would be the parotid gland, which is wedged into the hollow between the jaw and the mastoid process, and projects some- what below the level of the j aw. Its connections have been noticed at p. 31. Direction, — The student has next to proceed with the examination of the individual parts that have been referred to in connection with the triangular spaces. Anterior Anterior jugular vein, — This small vein occupies the vein middle line of the neck, and its size is dependent upon the degree of development of the external jugular. Beginning in some small branches below the chin, the vein descends to the sternum, and then turns outwards beneath the sterno- mastoid muscle, to open into the subclavian vein, or the joins external jugular. In the neck the anterior and external tian^^' jugular veins communicate. There are two anterior veins, one for each side, though one is usually larger than theSTERNO-MASTOID MUSCLE. 67 other, and at the bottom of the neck they are joined by a transverse branch. The STERNO-CLEIDO-MASTOID MUSCLE formS the superficial Stemo. prominence of the side of the neck, and divides the lateral muscle surface of the neck into two triangular spaces. The muscle is narrower in the centre than at the ends, and is attached below by two heads of origin, which are separated by an elongated interval. The inner head is fixed by a narrowed has its ° ^ *^ origin at tendon to the anterior part of the first piece of the sternum, stemum, and the outer head has a wide attachment to the sternal clavicle, third of the clavicle. From this origin the heads are di- rected upwards, the internal passing backwards and the external almost vertically, and are blended about the middle of the neck in a roundish muscle. Near the head the muscle ends in a tendon, which is then inserted into the base of the and in- . sertion mastoid process at the outer aspect, and by a thin aponeurosis at skuii. into a rough surface behind that process, as well as into the outer part of the upper curved line of the occipital bone. The borders of the muscle correspond to the triangular Guide t© spaces of the neck, and the anterior one is the guide to the position of the common carotid artery. On its cutaneous Position surface the sterno-mastoid is covered by the common inte-parts. guments and platysma, by the external jugular vein and superficial branches of the cervical plexus (across the middle part), and by the deep fascia. If the muscle be cut through below and raised, it will be seen to lie on the following parts: — the clavicular origin lies over the anterior scalenus and omo-hyoid muscles; and the sternal head conceals the depressors of the hyoid bone, and the common carotid artery with its vein and nerves. After the union of the heads, the muscle is placed over the cervical plexus, the middle scalenus, and the elevator of the angle of the scapula; and near the skull, on the digastric and splenius muscles, with the occi- pital artery, and a part of the parotid gland. The spinal accessory nerve perforates the muscular fibres about the upper third. The extent of the attachment to the clavicle varies, and in some bodies it may reach even to the trape- zius. The OMO-HYOID MUSCLE crosscs beneath the sterno-mas- omo- toideus, and consists of two fleshy bellies united by a small muTcie round intermediate tendon. The origin of the muscle from thf s°ca-*DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 68 tions.

From the in- at hyoid bone. tervening tendon, the anterior fleshy part is directed for- wards along the border of the sterno-hyoid muscle, and is inserted into the lower part of the body of the hyoid bone, Connec closc to the great cornu. The anterior belly of the muscle is in contact with the fascia, after escaping from beneath the sterno-mastoid; and rests on the sterno-thyroid muscle. This muscle crosses the common carotid artery on a level with the cricoid cartilage. The STERNO-HYOiD MUSCLE is a flat thin band nearer the muscle lii^® ^^^^ preceding. It arises from the posterior aspect of the sternum and the cartilage of the first rib, and sometimes also from the clavicle.

The origin of the muscle varies much. thyrSid The STERNO-THYROID MUSCLE is wider and shorter than S nTmed stcmo-hyoid, beneath which it lies. Like the other attach? hyoid muscle, it arises from the posterior surface of the sternum, from the cartilage of the first rib below the former, and sometimes from the cartilage of the second rib; and is inserted into the oblique line on the side of the thyroid cartilage, where it is continuous with the thyro-hyoid Parts muscle. The inner border corresponds to the middle line of above ^ and be- the ucck and to the thyroid veins, whilst the outer reaches the carotid artery.

This is sometimes considered one of the special muscles of the larynx. Direction, — The remaining parts included in this section are the scaleni muscles and the subclavian blood-vessels, and the cervical nerves and the carotid blood-vessels. The stu- dent may examine these in the order here given. Dissection. — Supposing the sterno-mastoid to be cut, the Dissec- fat and fascia are to be taken away from the lovy^er part of lll^e sub- the neck, so as to prepare the scaleni muscles, w^ith the sub- artery" clavian vessels and their branches. By means of a little dis- section the anterior scalenus muscle will be seen ascending from the first rib to the neck, having the phrenic nerve and subclavian vein in front of it, the latter being near the rib. The part of the subclavian artery that is on the inner side of the scalenus is then to be cleaned, care being taken not only of its branches, but of the branches of the sympathetic nerve which course from the neck to the chest. This dissection will be facilitated by the removal of a part or the whole of the clavicle. All the branches of the artery are in general and easily found, except the superior intercostal, which is to be es. sought in the thorax in front of the neck of the first rib. On the branch (inferior thyroid) ascending to the thyroid body, or near it, is the middle cervical ganglion of the sym- pathetic, and the dissector should follow downwards from it the small nerves to the thorax. Only the origin and first part of the course of the vascular branches can now be seen ; their termination is met with in other stages of this dissec- tion, or in the dissection of other parts of the body. In this stage the student should seek the small right lymphatic duct that opens into the subclavian vein near its junction ofiym- with the jugular. A notice of it will be given with the ductl^ lymphatics of the thorax. The outer part of the subclavian artery having been of already prepared, let the dissector remove more completely plexus, the connective tissue from the nerves of the cervical and brachial plexuses. From the brachial plexus trace the small subclavian branch; and the branches to the rhomboid and serratus muscles, which pierce the middle scalenus. If it p 370 DISSECTION OF THE NECK. is thought necessary, the anterior scalenus may be cut through after the artery has been studied. Of From the cervical plexus, besides muscular branches, the cervical plexus, student should seek small twigs to join the descendens noni; and should define the roots of the phrenic nerve. Lastly, let the surface of the middle scalenus muscle be cleaned, as it lies beneath the cervical nerves. Number The SCALENI musclcs are usually described as three in of sea- n 1 • 1 • leni number, and are named, from their relative position, anterior, * middle, and posterior: they extend from the first two ribs to the transverse processes of certain cervical vertebrae.

Origin It is attached by its apex to the inner border and the upper first rib; surfacc of the first rib, so as to surround the rough surface or projection on this aspect of the bone ; and by its base it i^nser- is inserted into the anterior transverse processes (parapo- physes) of four of the cervical vertebrae, viz. sixth, fifth, connec- fourth, and third. More deeply seated below than above, with the muscle is concealed by the clavicle and the subjacent muscles, j^^g^j^ (subclavius), and by the clavicular part of the sterno- mastoid: the phrenic nerve lies along the cutaneous surface vessels, of the musclc, and the subclavian vein crosses over it near the rib. Along the inner border is the internal jugular and vein. Beneath the scalenus are the pleura, the subclavian nerves, ^y,^^^^^ ^^^^ ucrvcs of the brachial plexus. The insertion into the vertebrse corresponds to the origin of the rectus capitis anticus major muscle. Scalenus The SCALENUS MEDius MUSCLE is larger than the anterior, or^'in!" and extends farthest of all on the vertebrae. Inferiorly it is attached to the inner border of the first rib ; and to a groove on the upper surface, which extends obliquely forwards for one inch and a half from the tubercle to the anterior border, inser- The muscle ascends behind the spinal nerves, and is inserted into the tips of the posterior transverse processes (diapo- Partsin physcs) of the six lower cervical vertebrae. In contact with it. with the anterior surface are the subclavian artery and the spinal nerves, together with the sterno-mastoid muscle ; whilst the posterior surface touches the posterior scalenus, and the deep lateral muscles of the back of the neck. TheSUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 71 outer border is perforated by the nerves of the rhomboid and serratus muscles. The SCALENUS POSTICUS is inconsiderable in size, and ap- scalenus pears part of the preceding. It is attached below by a slip, Attach- about half an inch wide, to the upper border of the second rib, in front of the elevator of that bone ; and above, it is inserted with the scalenus medius into two or three of the lower cervical vertebras. The SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY is a givcn part of the large vessel subcia- that supplies the upper limb with blood, to which this name artery; has been applied from its position beneath the clavicle. This extends vessel of the limb is derived from the branching of the inno- limb^^^ minate artery behind the sterno-clavicular articulation, and the part of it named subclavian extends as far as the lower border of the first rib. To reach the limb the artery crosses the lower part of the neck, taking an arched course over the bag of the pleura and the first ribj and between the scaleni muscles. For the purpose of describing the numerous con- and is nections of the subclavian artery the vessel may be divided fnto'^^^ into three parts : the first extending from the sterno-clavi- parts, cular articulation to the inner border of the anterior scalenus; the second, beneath the scalenus; and the third, from the outer border of that muscle to the lower edge of the first rib. First part,—Internal to the anterior scalenus the artery First lies deeply in the neck, and ascends slightly from the level ternaUo of its origin. Between the vessel and the surface will be is deepJ^ found the common tegumentary coverings and the deep fascia, the sterno-mastoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles, and a deep process of fascia from the inner border of the scalenus muscle. Crossing the artery near the scalenus Parts in are the large internal jugular, and the small vertebral vein; and internal to these veins is the pneumo-gastric nerve. Some branches of the sympathetic are likewise placed in front of the vessel. This part of the subclavian lies over the behind, longus colli muscle, though at some distance from it, and separated from it by connective tissue, by the recurrent branch of the pneumo-gastric nerve, and by the sympathetic nerve. Below the artery, both in this and the next part, is below, the pleura, which ascends into the arch formed by the vessel. F 4DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 72 Branch- Three branches arise from the subclavian in this part of its extent. Second Secojid part, — Beneath the scalenus the vessel is less neath^" deep than it is when internal to that muscle, and at this spot Parts in ^isGS highest above the clavicle. This second part, like the front, first, is covered by the integuments, platysma, and deep fascia; then by the clavicular origin of the sterno-mas- toideus ; and lastly by the anterior scalenus v^ith the phrenic behind, nervc. Behind the vessel is the middle scalenus. And above above. it, in the interval between the scaleni, are the large trunks of the lower cervical nerves ; with the exception of the trunk formed by the union of the last cervical and first dorsal, that lies between the artery and the middle scalenus. The subclavian vein is below the level of the artery, and One ^ separated from it by the anterior scalenus muscle. From this part of the subclavian one branch takes its origin. Third Third part. — Beyond the scalenus the subclavian artery ^^^^ is contained in the clavicular part of the posterior triangular space (p. 58.), and is nearer the surface than in the rest of its is super- coursc. Tliis part of the artery is comparatively superficial Parfs CO. whilst in the space before mentioned, for it is covered only venng intcguments, the platysma and deep fascia, with some superficial nerves of the cervical plexus, and the external beneath jugular vcin; but near its termination the vessel gets under cover of the suprascapular artery and vein, and the clavicle and subclavius muscle. In the third part of its course the above artery rests on the surface of the first rib. Above the vessel fow.*'^' is the brachial plexus, and below it is the subclavian vein. Usually no branch leaves the last part of the artery. Pecuiia- Peculiarities,— There are some peculiarities affecting the origin, ori^n^of the course, and the level in the neck of the subclavian artery, trunk • With reference to origin. The level at which it springs from the innominate trunk may vary; so that in one case it may be above the sterno-clavicular articulation, in another, below that joint. Or the artery may spring as a separate trunk from the arch of the aorta; and in such a state of the parts, the vessel takes a deeper place than usual to reach the scaleni muscles : — a condi- tion that will be referred to with the arch of the aorta in the course thorax. It has been before said (p. 59.) that the artery may be kvei. front of the scalenus or in its fibres; or that it may be placed one inch and a half above the level of the clavicle. Branch- Branches of the subclavian, — Usually there are four73 VERTEBRAL ARTERY. branclies to the subclavian artery. Three of these arise es of subcla- from the first part of the arterial trunk;—one (vertebral) vianar- ascends to the head; another (internal mamnaary) descends to the chest; and the remaining one (thyroid axis) is a short thick trunk, which furnishes branches inwards and outwards. These arise commonly near the scalenus muscle, ^p^"^ so as to leave an interval at the origin free from offsets, branch- This interval varies in length, being from half an inch to an inch in the greater number of cases ; and its extremes range from somewhat less .than half an inch to an inch and three quarters. But in some instances the branches are scattered over the whole extent of this part of the artery (Quain).* The fourth branch (superior intercostal) arises from the second part of the artery, viz. that beneath the anterior scalenus, and gives off the deep cervical branch. If there is a branch present on the third part of the artery, it is commonly the posterior scapular : if more than one, the internal mammary, and some offsets belonging usually to the thyroid axis will be added. 1. The vertebral artery is generally the first and largest vene- branch of the subclavian, and arises from the upper and teryin' posterior part of that vessel. Ascending between the con- tiguous borders of the scalenus and longus colli muscles, this branch enters the aperture between the transverse processes of the sixth cervical vertebra, and is continued upwards to the skull through the chain of foramina in the transverse processes of the other cervical vertebrae. Before the artery enters the transverse process it is partly concealed by the internal jugular vein, and passes beneath the thyroid artery ; it is accompanied by branches of the sympathetic nerve, and supplies small muscular offsets. Its course and distribution smaii will be given afterwards. esf"^ " On the left side the commencement of the vertebral artery on left is crossed by the thoracic duct. The origin of the vertebral may vary in its position along the Differ- first part of the trunk of the subclavian; or it may be transferred p"acVof to the arch of the aorta, especially on the left side; or to the right o^^s^"- * The student is referred for fuller information respecting the pecu- liarities of the vessels, and the practical applications to be deduced from them, to the original and valuable work on the Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body, by Richard Quain, F.R.S,DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 74 common carotid artery, when the subclavian of the same side arises from the aorta. The course of the artery is not constant through the hole between the transverse processes of the sixth vertebra; it may enter any other as high as the second. v«rte- The vertebral vein issues with its accompanying artery, to vein, which it is superficial in the neck, and is directed over the branch- subclavian artery to join the subclavian vein; it receives the deep cervical vein, and the branch that accompanies the ascending cervical artery. Internal 2. The internal mammary branch leaves the lower part mamma- , i • n ry artery of the subclaviau artery, and coursing downwards beneath neck. the clavicle and subjacent muscle, and the subclavian vein, enters the thorax between the first rib and the bag of the pleura. As the artery is about to enter the chest, it is crossed (superficially) by the phrenic nerve.

Thyroid axis.— This is a short thick trunk, that arises from the front of the artery near the anterior scalenus divides muscle, and soon divides into three branches : — one to the three, thyroid body, and two to the scapula that run outwards across the neck.

Some small branches are supplied by it to the posterior triangular space of the neck. Size and Though the transverse cervical artery supplies ordinarily the vary"^ posterior scapular branch, there are many examples in which, though holding its usual position in the neck, it is too small in size to give origin to so large an offset. In such instances the diminished artery ends in the trapezius muscle, whilst the posteriorSUPERIOR INTERCOSTAL ARTERY. 75 scapular branch arises separately from the third, or even the second part of the subclavian artery. c. The inferior thyroid branch is the largest offset of the thyroid inferior axis. Directed inwards to the thyroid body, the artery passes be- bJInch neath the common carotid artery and the accompanying vein and nerves, and in front of the longus colli muscle and the recurrent nerve. In this course the vessel is tortuous. At the lower part of the thyroid body it divides into branches that enter the under surface, whilst others communicate with the superior thyroid, and with the corresponding artery of the opposite side, forming a very free anastomosis between these vessels. ISTear the larynx a laryn- gives la- geal hranch is distributed to the back of that tube, and other off- ofiSft,^^ sets are furnished to the trachea. The ascending cervical artery is a branch of the thyroid near its and as- commencement; it is directed upwards between the scalenus and cervical rectus capitis anticus major, and ends in branches to those muscles and to the posterior triangle of the neck. Some small spinal offsets are conveyed along the spinal nerves to the cord and its membranes. d. Loivest thyroid.—In connection with the thyroid body a third Acces- thyroid artery may be occasionally present, which has been named branch art. thyroidea ima. This offset usually comes from the trunk of [JJ^g^ ' the innominate artery, but it may spring from the right common tiiyroid, carotid, or from the arch of the aorta. Whatever its origin, the small vessel ascends in front of the trachea to the thyroid body, and either takes the place of an absent inferior thyroid artery, or assists a smaller vessel than usual in supplying that body. The veins corresponding to the branches of the thyroid veins axis have the following destination:—those with the supra- spending 11 . , . . , , toarte- scapular and transverse cervical arteries open m the external ries. jugular vein. But the inferior thyroid vein begins in a plexus connected with the thyroid body, and descends in front of the trachea, beneath the muscles covering this tube, to end in the innominate vein. 4. The superior intercostal artery arises from the posterior superior part of the subclavian, and bends downwards over the neck taitrte-' of the first rib to the thorax. Its distribution to the first neck, two intercostal spaces will be seen in the thorax. Arising in common with this branch is the deep cervical Deep artery (art. profunda cervicis). Analogous to the dorsal arteJy^'^ branch of an intercostal artery (Quain), it passes backwards between the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra and the first rib, and ends beneath the complexus muscle at the posterior part of the neck.76 DISSECTION OF THE NECK. subcia- The SUBCLAVIAN VEIN has nearly the same limits as the vian vein; artery of the same name, viz., from the lower border of the first rib to the sterno-clavicular articulation. It is a con- tinuation upwards of the axillary vein, and ends by joining the internal jugular to form the innominate vein. Its course is nearly straight, and commonly below the level of the artery, from which it is separated by the anterior scalenus its muscle. The anterior and external jugular join this vein es; outside the scalenus, and the vertebral vein enters it inside opening that musclc. Into the ansrle of union of the subclavian and of ® J^ymph- jugular veins the right lymphatic duct opens; and at the ducts, same spot, on the left side, is the entrance of the large lymphatic duct. It should be borne in mind that not un- frequently the vein is as high in the neck as the third part of its companion artery; and that the vein has been twice seen with the artery beneath the anterior scalenus. Cervical The ANTERIOR PRIMARY BRANCHES OF THE CERVICAL nerves. NERVES spring from the common trunks in the interver- position tebral foramina, and appear on the side of the neck between number, the intertransverse muscles. These spinal nerves are eight in number, and are equally divided between the cervical and the brachial plexus; the highest four being combined in the former, and the remaining nerves in the latter plexus. At their commencement the nerves intermix by communi- cating branches, and receive offsets of communication from the sympathetic. First To this general statement respecting the position of the frr^from nerves between the intertransverse muscles, some modifica- tion is necessary for the first two nerves; and the pecu- liarities concerning them will be noticed in Section 18. Brachial BRACHIAL Plexus.— The first dorsal and four lower piexus] (.Qj-Yical nerves are blended in this plexus, and a fasciculus is added to them from the lowest nerve entering the cervical formed pl^^us. Thus formed, the plexus reaches from the lowest nerves. P^^^ ueck to the axiUa, where it ends in nerves for the upper limb. Only the part of it above the clavicle can now be seen. In the neck the nerves have but little of a plexi- form disposition: they lie at first between the scaleni muscles, and have the following arrangement: — Disposi- The fifth and sixth nerves unite near the vertebrae; theBRANCHES OF THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS. 6. The suprascapular nerve is larger than either of the others, supra- seventh remains distinct as far as the outer border of the tion of middle scalenus; and the last cervical and first dorsal are the p?ex- blended in one trunk beneath the anterior scalenus ; so that neck. ^ they are combined at first into three cords. Near the attach- ment of the middle scalenus to the rib, the seventh nerve throws itself into the trunk formed by the fifth and sixth, and then there result two cords to the plexus: — the one formed by the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves ; and the other, by the eighth cervical and the first dorsal nerve. These two trunks accompany the subclavian artery, lying to its acromial side, and are continued to the axilla, where they are more intimately blended. Branches, — The branches of the plexus may be classed Branch- into those above the clavicle, and those below that bone. The highest set end mostly in the muscles of the lower part in the , neck are: of the neck, and in those of the chest and shoulder; whilst the other set consist of the terminal branches, and are furnished to the upper limb, with which they will be referred to. Branches above the Clavicle.— 1. Branch to the phrenic To nerve. This ofi*set comes from the trunk of the fifth cervical nerve, Eerve,'*^ and joins the phrenic on the anterior scalenus muscle. 2. The branch to the suhclavius muscle is a very slender twig, Nerve of that arises from the trunk formed by the fifth and sixth nerves, vius, and is directed downwards over the subclavian artery to the under- surface of the muscle ; it is often united with the phrenic nerve at the lower part of the neck. 3. The branch for the rhomboid muscle springs from the fifth Nerve of nerve in the substance of the middle scalenus, and perforates the boideus, fibres of that muscle ; it is afterwards directed beneath the levator anguli scapulae to its destination. Branches are usually given from this nerve to the levator anguli scapulas. 4. T\iQ posterior thoracic nerve (nerve of the serratus, external Nerve of respiratory nerve of Bell) is contained in the scalenus, like the preceding, and arises from the fifth and six nerves, near the intervertebral foramina. Piercing the fibres of the scalenus lower than the preceding branch, the nerve is continued behind the brachial plexus, and enters the serratus magnus muscle on the axillary surface. 5. Branches for the scaleni and longus colli muscles.— These are Nerves small twigs that are seen when the anterior scalenus is divided; ni and ' they arise from the trunks of the nerves as soon as these leave the com"^ spinal canal.DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 78 scapular It arises near the subclavian branch from the same cord of the nerve, pj^xus, viz., that formed by the fifth and sixth nerves. Its desti- nation is the dorsum of the scapula, on which it will be dissected with the arm. Cervical The CERVICAL PLEXUS is formed bj the anterior primary plexus IS j|^j.^j^^]^gg ^Yie first four cervical nerves. Situate at the upper part of the neck, it lies beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle, and on the middle scalenus and the levator anguli scapulae. Its appearance differs much from that of the brachial plexus, for it resembles a network^ more than a formed bundle of large cords. The follov^^ing is the general ar- branch- rangcmeut of the nerves in the plexus: — each nerve, except the° the first, divides into an ascending and descending branch, nerves. and these unite w^ith similar parts of the contiguous nerves, so as to give rise to a series of arches. From these loops or arches the different branches arise. Its Branches. — The branches of the plexus are both super- aSsu- ficial and deep. The superficial set are described v^ith the perficiai, ^j^jg^j^g^jg^j. gpace of the neck, as consisting of ascending and descending nerves (p. 60.). In this stage of the dissection the ascending branches are seen to spring from the union of the second and third nerves, and the descending ones to come from the loop between the third and fourth nerves, and deep. The deep set of branches remain nov^ to be examined. Deep The DEEP BRANCHES OF THE PLEXUS are both muscular are: and Communicating, and may be arranged into an internal and an external series. Phrenic INTERNAL Series.— 1. The phrenic or muscular nerve of nerve, , , , ^ the diaphragm is derived from the fourth, or third and fourth nerves of the plexus, and it may be joined by a fasciculus from the fifth cervical nerve. Descending obliquely on the surface of the anterior scalenus, from the outer to the inner edge, it enters the chest in front of the internal mammary artery, but behind the sub- clavian vein, and traverses that cavity to reach the diaphragm. At the lower part of the neck the phrenic nerve is joined by a filament of the sympathetic, and sometimes by an offset of the nerve to the subclavian muscle. Nerves 2. The branches communicating with the descendens noni are two descend- number. One of these arises from the second, and the other ens noni, fj-Qm the third cervical nerve; they are directed inwards either over or under the internal jugular vein, and communicate with the descending muscular branch (descendens noni) of the hypo- glossal nerve.79 COMMON CAROTID ARTERY. 3. Muscular hranches are furnished to the recti muscles; these Branch- arise from the loop between the first two nerves, and from the recu trunks of the other nerves close to the intervertebral foramina. 4. Some connecting hranches pass from the loop between the first Branch- two nerves to the sympathetic, and to the cranial nerves near the other base of the skull: these will be afterwards described. nerves. B. External or Posterior Series.—1. Muscular branches are Branch- given from the second nerve to the sterno-mastoideus; from the muscles, third nerve to the levator anguli scapulae; and from the third and fourth nerves to the trapezius. Further, some small branches supply the substance of the middle scalenus. 2. Connecting hranches vnth the spinal accessory nerve.—-TheBranch- communications between this cranial and the spinal nerves are nu- ing spi- merous. First, in the sterno-mastoid muscle; next, in the postei 'lOr cessory. triangular space ; and, lastly, beneath the trapezius. The union with those branches that are distributed to the trapezius has the appearance of a plexus. The COMMON CAROTID ARTERY is the leading vessel for the Common supply of blood to the neck and bead, and is remarkable in artery, not furnishing collateral branches. The origin of the vessel is different on opposite sides of the body, being on the right, at the lower part of the neck, and on the left side, in the thorax. The vessel of the right side commences opposite the origin, sterno-clavicular articulation at the bifurcation of the inno- minate artery, and ends at the upper border of the thyroid cartilage by dividing into the two trunks before seen, viz., external and internal carotid. The course of the artery is course, along the side of the trachea and larynx, gradually diverg- ing from the vessel on the opposite side in consequence of the increasing size of the larynx; and its position will be situa- marked by a line from the sterno-clavicular articulation to a point midway between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process. Contained in a sheath of cervical fascia, with the internal jugular vein to the outside, and the pneumo- gastric nerve between the two, the carotid artery has the following connections with the surrounding parts:—As high Tarts co- as the cricoid cartilage the vessel is deeply placed, and is concealed by the common coverings of the skin, platysma and fasciae, and by the muscles at the lower part of the neck, viz., sterno-mastoid (sternal origin), sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid.80 DISSECTION OF THE NECK. and omo-hyoid; and beneath the muscles by the middle thy- roid vein. But above the cricoid cartilage to its termination the artery is covered only by the sterno-mastoid and the common investments of the part; superficial to it here is the descendens noni nerve, and crossing the upper part are offsets of the superior thyroid artery with the accompany- beneath ing vein. The vessel rests mostly on the longus colli muscle, but close to its ending on the rectus capitis anticus major; on the sympathetic nerve and its branches ; and on and on the recurrent nerve and the inferior thyroid artery. To its sides, ^j^^ inner side of the carotid lie the trachea and larynx, with the oesophagus and the thyroid body, the last over- hanging the vessel by the side of the larynx. Along the outer side of the carotid sheath is a chain of lymphatic glands. Internal INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN.

Differ- Peculiarities.— Some of the followinG: peculiarities of the com- orf^V" carotid may be met with. Its origin on the right side may be above or below the point above stated; or it may be transferred to tbe arch of the aorta, or to the left carotid in the thorax. Men- tion has been made of the difference in the place of bifurcation, and of the fact that, occasionally, the common carotid artery is not divided into two. (See page 65.) in num- Instead of one there may be two trunks issuing from beneath the hyoid muscles, for the common carotid has been found divided in one case after an extent of one inch and a half. As an ex- tremely rare occurrence its usual terminal branches, the external and internal carotids, may arise as distinct arteries from the arch of the aorta. Its Usually the common carotid is without branch, but it may give81 DIGASTRIC MUSCLE. origin to the superior thyroid, the inferior thyroid, or the vertebral branch- artery. Dissection, — The dissector may next trace out completely J^^^^^c- the trunk of the external carotid, and follow its branches until they disappear beneath different parts. Afterwards he may separate from one another the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, which cross the carotid, and define their origin and insertion. The DIGASTRIC MUSCLE consists of two fleshy bellies, Digas- trie united by an intervenino^ tendon, whence its name. The muscle ^ has two posterior belly, the larger of the two, arises from the groove beiiies, beneath the mastoid process, whilst the anterior belly takes origin from the base of the lower jaw, on the side of the symphysis. From these places of origin the fibres are directed to the intervening tendon: — those of the posterior belly are the longest, and are inclined obliquely forwards, and those of the anterior belly pass more vertically down- wards. The tendon of the muscle is surrounded by fibres which of the stylo-hyoideus ; and it is attached to its fellow and to ed\^y'a" the OS hyoides by means of an aponeurotic expansion, that keeps in position the arch of the muscle, and is inserted below into the body, and a part of the great cornu of the hyoid bone. The arch formed by the digastric is superficial, Position except at the outer part, where it is beneath the sterno- and parts, trachelo-mastoid muscles. The posterior belly crosses the carotid vessels and the accompanying veins and nerves; and is placed across the anterior triangular space of the neck in the position of a line from the mastoid process to a little above the hyoid bone; along its lower border will be found the occipital artery and the hypoglossal nerve, the former passing backwards, the latter forwards. The anterior belly rests on the mylo-hyoid muscle. The digastric muscle describes an arch across the side of The the neck, and forms the lower boundary of a space that bo'unds a reaches upwards to the jaw and the mastoid process, and to "^^^^ the base of the skull in front of the ear. This space is divided into two parts by the stylo-maxillary ligament, In the posterior portion are contained the parotid gland and that con- the vessels and nerves in connection with it (p. 31.); in the ToSaIua anterior are the submaxillary gland and the facial vessels, maxii- aDISSECTION OF THE NECK. 82 lary and deeper still the muscles between the chin and the hyoid glands. bone. stylo- The STYLO-HTOiD MUSCLE is thin and slender, and has the ul^^^^' same position as the posterior belly of the digastric. It Origin, avises from the outer aspect of the styloid process, near the inser- basc Or about the middle, and is inserted into the body of sur- the OS hyoides. The muscle has the same connections as digastric the posterior belly of the digastric: and its fleshy fibres are usually perforated by the tendon of that muscle. In many bodies the stylo-hyoid muscle is absent. Ninth The HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE (ninth cranial) may now be the ante- examined, at least that part of it which is seen in the anterior angie!^' triangle of the neck. Appearing at the lower edge of the digastric muscle, the nerve hooks round the occipital artery; it is then directed forwards below the digastric, and disap- pears in front beneath the mylo-hyoid muscle. As the nerve crosses the neck, it lies over the carotid vessels; and near the cornu of the os hyoides it crosses the lingual artery, so as to become highest of the two. Its Branches, —In this part of its course the nerve gives the here ar? desccndons noui branch and a small muscular offset to the muscu- , T 1 • J lar. thyro-hyoiaeus.

After the union of the spinal wi^thcer- jjgj,^gg offsets are supplied to the lower hyoid muscles, viz. omo- nerves \^yQ\^ (both bellies), sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid. Some- times another offset is continued to the thorax, where it joins the by inter- phrenic and cardiac nerves. The connection between the descen- r^Sting dens noni and the spinal nerves is formed by two or more cross fibres, filaments, so as to construct an arch with the concavity upwards; and an interchange of filaments between the two nerves has been described.

At first the external carotid is com- Parts su- , perficial paratively superficial, and easily reached from the surface, to it, being overlaid only by the sterno-mastoideus and the com- mon coverings of the anterior triangular space, viz. the skin, the superficial and deep fasciae with the platysma, and the superficial nerves. But above the situation of a line ex- tended from the mastoid process to the hyoid bone, the carotid artery is crossed by the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles with the hypoglossal nerve; and still higher it enters the substance of the parotid gland, where it lies beneath the facial nerve and the external jugular vein. The external carotid is also crossed by the facial and lingual branches of veins joining the internal jugular trunk. At beneath first the artery is situate over the superior laryngeal nerve, and is unsupported by muscular fibre, though it rests against the pharynx; but above the angle of the jaw it is placed over the styloid process and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which separate it from the internal carotid. To the inner and on side of the vessel at first is the pharynx, and still higher are side, the ramus of the jaw and the stylo-maxillary ligament. In certain conditions a companion vein from the temporal and internal maxillary (p. 32.) will accompany the arterial trunk. The branches of the external carotid are numerous, and branch- are classed into an anterior, posterior, and ascending set. es are The anterior set comprise branches to the thyroid body, the anterior, tongue, and the face, viz. superior thyroid, lingual, and facial arteries ; in the posterior set are the occipital and posterior poste- auricular branches; and the ascending set include the ascend- ng: ascending pharyngeal, temporal, and internal maxillary ? arteries. Besides these, the carotid gives other branches to the sterno-mastoid muscle and the parotid gland. The regular origin of the branches, as this will be described f,^^"rf5n below, may be departed from by means of the closer aggre- gation of the branches on the trunk of the carotid. And and in further, the usual number may be diminished by two or more84 DISSECTION OF THE XECK. taking origin in common ; or the number may be increased by some of the secondary offsets being transferred to the parent trunk.

The facial vein (p. 30.) joins the internal jugular vein. Facial In the cervical part of its course it receives branches corre- sponding to those of the artery, and often throws itself into the temporo-maxillary trunk. The occipital artery is of considerable size, and is destined occipi- for the back of the head. It arises from the carotid opposite artery the facial branch, and near the lower border of the digastric muscle. From this spot the artery ascends to the inner part of the mastoid process of the temporal bone; next it turns ends on 7 . . occiput; horizontally backwards on the occipital bone, passing above the transverse process of the atlas ; and finally becomes cutaneous near the middle line (p. 6.). In the neck this in neck artery passes beneath the digastric muscle and a part of the offset to parotid gland ; and crosses over the internal carotid artery, the jugular vein, and the spinal accessory and hypoglossal nerves. The only offset from the artery in the front of the neck is a the dura small posterior meningeal branch to the dura mater in the posterior fossa of the base of the skull.

Section VL pterygo-maxillary region. In this region are included the muscles superficial to and contents beneath the ramus of the jaw, together with the articulation region, of the bone. In connection with the muscles (pterygoid) beneath the ramus of the jaw, are the internal maxillary blood-vessels, and the inferior maxillary trunk of the fifth nerve. Diss€ctio7i. — The masseter muscle, which is superficial to disscc- thejaw, comes first from without inwards. To see it the branches of the facial nerve and the transverse facial artery should be cut through, and turned backwards off the face. A little cleaning will suffice to show the fibres, and to define the origin and insertion of the muscle. Should there be in the mouth any of the material that made tense the fibres of the orbicularis, let it be removed. The MASSETER MUSCLE conccals the ramus of the lower Masse- ter jaw, and is divided into two portions, superficial and deep, j,astwo by means of an aponeurosis, which projects at the upper p^'^'^- part into the muscular fibres.

To see Dissectiou.—To lay bare the temporal muscle to its inser- of tern- tion, the following dissection may be made : — The temporal muscle, fascia is to be detached from the upper border of the zygo- matic arch, and removed from the surface of the muscle. Next, the arch is to be sawn through, in front and behind, so as to include its whole length; and to be thrown down (without being cut off) with the masseter muscle still at- tached to it, by separating the fibres of the muscle from the upper part of the ramus of the jaw. In detaching the mas- seter muscle, the nerve and artery to it, that appear through the sigmoid notch, will be found. The surface and insertion of the temporal muscle may then be cleaned, jnsor- Afterwards, to see the insertion and extent of origin of the muscle, let the coronoid process be sawn off by a cut passing from the centre of the sigmoid notch nearly to the last molar tooth, so as to include the whole of the insertion of the muscle; and in this proceeding let the student be careful of the buccal artery and nerve issuing from beneath it. Lastly, the coronoid process should be raised in order that the extent of the lower fibres of the temporal muscle, and their contiguity to the external pterygoid, close below them, may be observed. Origin of The temporal muscle has been before seen to occupy the muscle ^PP^^ P^^^ temporal fossa (p. 4.) ; and by the previous dissection the lower part has been laid bare. The origin of the muscle is the following: — It occupies the whole of the temporal fossa, reaching up to the semicircular line on the side of the skull, and downwards to the crest on the outer aspect of the great wing of the sphenoid bone. From this extensive origin, as well as from the fascia over it, the fibres inser- convcrgo to a superficial tendon, which is inserted into all the inner surface of the coronoid process, from the apex to near the last molar tooth. Behind the posterior border of the tendon are the masseteric vessels and nerve, and in front of it the buccal vessels and nerve : the last nerve occasionally perforates some of the fibres of the muscle.

A piece of the ramus of the jaw is next to be removed, but without injuring the vessels and nerves in contact with its inner surface, by sawing across the bone close to the condyle, and again close above the dental fora- men ; and to make the dental vessels and nerve secure from injury, the handle of the scalpel may be inserted close be- neath the bone and carried downwards to their entrance into the foramen. The masseteric artery and nerve are liable to be cut in sawing the bone ; should these be divided, turn them upwards for the present, and afterwards tie together the ends. After the loose piece of bone has been removed, and the subjacent parts freed from fat, the ptery- goid muscles will appear, — the external being directed out- wards to the condyle of the jaw, and the internal, which is parallel in direction to the masseter, being inclined to the angle of the jaw. In removing the fatty tissue, the student must be careful not to take away the thin fascia of the in- ternal lateral ligament, which is beneath the ramus. Many vessels and nerves will be found in this region, Position with the following position to other parts. Crossing inwards parts, over the external pterygoid muscle, is the internal maxillary artery, which distributes offsets upwards and downwards; sometimes this artery will be placed beneath the muscle. Escaping from beneath the lower border of the same muscle are the large dental and gustatory nerves, the latter being the more internal of the two; and appearing between the upper border of the muscle and the cranium, are the mas- seteric and deep temporal nerves. The buccal branch of nerve perforates the fibres of the external pterygoid near its inner attachment. Branches of the above-mentioned artery accompany these nerves. At the front of the space now dissected, coursing along the posterior part of the upper jaw, is the small posterior dental nerve with an artery. Between the jaws is the whitish narrow band of the inter- pterygo-maxillary ligament, to which the buccinator and lary superior constrictor muscles are connected.

Joint of Temporo-maxillary ARTICULATION. —In this joint the lower ^ jaw. condyle of the jaw is received into the anterior part of the hollow of the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone. The bones are retained in contact mostly by the strong muscles of the ' lower jaw; but the following ligaments are concerned in uniting them. External The external lateral is a short, ligamentous band, whichTEMPOKO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATION. 91 is attached above to the tubercle at the root of the zygoma, lateral and below to the outer side of the neck of the inferior maxilla. The internal lateral ligament is a long, thin, membranous internal band, which is not in contact with the joint. Superiorly it liga- is connected by a pointed piece to the spinous process of the sphenoid, and the vaginal process of the temporal bone; and inferiorly it is inserted into the orifice of the dental canal in the lower jaw. This ligament lies beneath the ramus of the jaw, between it and the internal pterygoid muscle, and its origin is concealed by the external pterygoid muscle. Be- tween the ligament and the jaw is the internal maxillary artery. Besides these ligaments there are some scattered fibres Capsuie surrounding the articulation, which serve the purpose of a capsular membrane. Dissection. — After the external lateral ligament and the Dissec- capsule of the joint have been removed, an interarticular fibro-cartilage, with a synovial membrane above and below it, will be exposed. The interarticular Jibro-cartilage is adapted to the sur- Fibro- faces of the bones. It is elongated transversely, is thin-iage; ner in the centre than at the margins, and an aperture is sometimes present in the middle. The upper surface fits its form into the glenoid fossa, being concavo-convex from before backwards, and the lower is moulded to the convexity of the condyle of the law. Externally it is connected with the and attach- capsule and the external lateral ligament; and in front the ments. external pterygoid muscle is attached to it. Two synovial membranes are present in the articulation— Two sy- one above, and one below the fibro-cartilage. The lower mem- one is the smaller of the two ; and, besides investing the interior of the capsule, it extends from this to the surface of the jaw. Another structure—the stylo-maxillary ligament — is styio- described as a uniting band to this articulation. This is a i^ry liga- process of the deep cervical fascia, which extends from the styloid process to the hinder part of the ramus of the jaw. The piece of fascia here referred to, gives attachment to the stylo-glossus muscle, and separates the parotid and sub- maxillary glands.92 DISSECTION OF THE PTERYGOID REGION. issec- Dissection, — The condyle of the jaw is next to be dis- articulated, still keeping the external pterygoid muscle uncut; and it with the attached muscle is to be drawn forwards so as to see the fifth nerve beneath; whilst cutting through the articular ligaments the dissector must be careful of the auriculo-temporal nerve close beneath. On drawing forwards the pterygoid muscle, and removing some con- nective tissue, the dissector will find the trunk and branches of the inferior maxillary nerve. All the four small muscular branches of the nerve should be traced to the trunk in the foramen ovale of the sphenoid bone ; its auriculo-temporal branch should be followed backwards with care behind the articulation ; and the small chorda tympani should be found joining the posterior part of the gustatory nerve near the skull. The middle meningeal artery is to be sought beneath the external pterygoid ; and oftentimes the trunk of the in- ternal maxillary artery will be found beneath that muscle. Internal The INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY is OUe of the terminal lary ar- brauchcs of the external carotid, and takes a winding course beneath the lower jaw and the temporal muscle to the spheno- maxillary fossa, where it ends in branches for the face, the interior of the nose, and the palate and pharynx. Course ^^st the artery is directed inwards beneath the jaw, be- nections" twccu the bono and the internal lateral ligament of the joint, and crosses the dental nerve. Next, the vessel winds over the external pterygoid muscle, being placed between it and the temporal muscle. And lastly, the artery enters the spheno- maxillary fossa between the processes of origin of the exter- nal pterygoid muscle. The trunk of the artery may be divided into three parts : one beneath the jaw, a second be- tween the muscles, and a third in the spheno-maxillary Varies fossa. The course of the arterv is sometimes beneath, in- position, stead of over the external pterygoid muscle: in such in- stances the artery gains the spheno-maxillary fossa by coming upwards through the origin of the muscle cover- ing it. Branch- The branches of this artery are very numerous, and are three^ classcd iuto thrco sets, corresponding to the divisions made in the trunk of the artery ; thus one set arises beneath the jaw, another beneath the temporal muscle, and another in the spheno-maxillary fossa.BRANCHES OF INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. 93 Two branches, viz. the inferior dental and middle menin- Those geal, leave the internal maxillary artery, whilst it is in con- jawf^ nection with the ramus of the jaw. 1 The inferior dental branch descends between the internal late- inferior . dental; ral ligament and the jaw, and enters the foramen on the inner surface of the ramus, along with the dental nerve., to supply the teeth.

The superior ov posterior dental branch arises near the upper maxillary bone, and descends to the teeth with a tortuous course on the outer surface of that bone, along with a small branch of the superior maxillary nerve. For the most part its offsets enter the foramina in the bone, and supply the upper molar and bicuspid teeth, but some are furnished to the gums. A few branches reach the lining membrane of the antrum.

The veins of this region form a plexus — gSid)?' pt^'^ygoid, between the two pterygoid muscles, and in part between the temporal and external pterygoid muscles. This plexus communicates with the facial vein by a large branch (anterior internal maxillary); and with the cavernous sinus in the interior of the skull, by means of branches that pass and ends through apertures in the base of the cranium. Escaping from nai^ugul the plexus, the vein accompanies the artery to the parotid ^' gland, and there joins the superficial temporal vein,— the union of the two giving rise to a vessel that enters either the external or the internal jugular vein (p. 32.). ^ .]||| Inferior The INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE is the largest of the three ry nerve trunks arising from the Gasserian ganglion (p. 19.), and re- sembles a spinal nerve in possessing fibrils that confer both motory and sensory properties on the parts to which they consists are distributed.

The deep temporal branches are furnished to the under surface temporal of the temporal muscle. Like the arteries, they are two in number, "^"^^'^' anterior and posterior. From their origin these nerves course two in upwards along the outer surface of the skull, and pass beneath the external pterygoid muscle. The posterior branch is the smallest, and is often derived from posterior the masseteric nerve ; it is near the back of the temporal fossa.* The anterior branch supplies the greater part of the muscle, and anterior, communicates sometimes with the buccal nerve. 2. The masseteric branch takes at first a backward course above Masse- the external pterygoid muscle, and then a horizontal one, behind the temporal muscle and through the sigmoid notch, to the under surface of the masseter muscle. In the masseter the nerve can be followed to near the anterior border. As this branch passes by the articulation of the jaw it gives one or more twigs to that joint. 3. The pterygoid branches are supplied to the muscles of that Branch- name. The branch or branches to the external pterygoid enter pte^ry- the under surface, but the nerve to the internal pterygoid is placed f°uscies on the pharyngeal aspect of this muscle close to the skull: this last, which cannot now be seen, will be learnt in the dissection of the otic ganglion {Section 14.). 4. The buccal branch is longer than the others, and perforates Buccina- the inner attachment of the external pterygoid; afterwards it is directed inwards, beneath the coronoid process and the temporal muscle, to the surface of the buccinator, where it ends in two ter- minal branches. As the nerve perforates the pterygoid muscle This filaments are given to the fleshy substance; and after it has passed ends^iri through the fibres, it furnishes a branch to the temporal muscle, p^°j.g which frequently joins the anterior deep temporal nerve. Some offsets are likewise distributed to the upper part of the buccinator muscle and to the lining mucous membrane.

In structure, the submaxillary resembles the parotid gland (p. 33.) ; and its duct — duct of Wharton, extends beneath the mylo-hyoid muscle to the mouth. Dissection,—The mylo-hyoid muscle may be seen by de- Dissec- taching the anterior belly of the digastric from the jaw, and by dislodging, without injury, the submaxillary gland from its position under the maxilla.

On the cutaneous surface are the digastric muscle, the submaxillary gland, the facial artery with the submental offset, and its own branch of nerve and artery. Its fibres are frequently deficient near the jaw, and allow the next Parts muscle to be seen. Only the posterior border is unattached, u.^"" and round it a piece of the submaxillary gland winds. The parts in contact with the deep surface of the muscle will be perceived after the following dissection has been made.

To enable the dissector to raise upwards sufficiently this loose piece of bone, let the apex of the tongue be drawn well out of the mouth over the upper teeth, and fastened with a stitch to the septum of the nose; then let the scalpel be passed from below upwards between the cut surfaces of the bone, for the purpose of dividing a strong band of the mucous membrane of the mouth, and let it be carried onwards along the middle line of the tongue to the tip. After these directions have been followed the loose piece of the jaw can be easily turned upwards ; and it is to be fastened in that position with thread, and By means of a hook the os hyoides may be drawn down, and the muscular fibres made tense. All the connective tissue is now to be removed, and in doing this the student is to take care of the Whartonian duct; of the hypoglossal nerve and its branches that lie on the hyo-glossus muscle ; also of the gustatory nerve, nearer the jaw, with its small ganglion close to the submaxillary gland. The student should endeavour to follow the small chorda tympani nerve, which is applied to the trunk of the gustatory, onwards to the tongue, and to define the offset from it to the submaxillary ganglion. The ranine vessels, and the gustatory and hypoglossal nerves are then to be found on the under part of the tongue, and to be followed to the tip. Parts be- Parfs beneath mylo-hyoideus. — The following is the posi- myfo- tion of the objects brought into view by the steps of the ^^^^'^ previous dissection. Extending from the cornu of the hyoid bone to the side of the tongue is the hyo-glossus muscle, whose fibres are crossed superiorly by those of the stylo- onside glossus. On the hyo-glossus are placed, from below up- ^ ' wards, the hypoglossal nerve, the Whartonian duct, and the gustatory nerve, the latter crossing the duct; and near the inner border of that muscle those two nerves are united by branches. Beneath the same muscle is the lingual artery with its vein. Above the hyo-glossus is the mucous mem- brane of the mouth, with the sublingual gland attached to it in front, and some fibres of the superior constrictor muscle covering it behind near the jaw. and Between the chin and the os hyoides, along the middle m?ddie line, is the genio-hyoid muscle ; and larger and deeper than this is a fan-shaped muscle, the genio-hyo-glossus. Along101 HYO-GLOSSUS MUSCLE. H 3 the outer side of the last muscle lie the ranine vessels ; and a sublingual branch for the gland of the same name springs from the lingual artery at the inner border of the hjo-glossus. On the under aspect of the tongue, near the margin, lies the gustatory nerve; and in the fibres of the genio-hyo- glossus, the hypoglossal nerve. The HYO-GLOSSUS MUSCLE is thin and somewhat square in Hyo- glossus shape. The muscle arises from the lateral part of the body of the OS hyoides (basio-glossus), from all the great cornu of the same bone (cerato-glossus), and separately from the small cornu (chondro-glossus). The two first parts form a thin sheet, and enter the back part and side of the tongue* ; they will be after seen to mingle with fibres of the palato- and stylo-glossus. The parts in contact with one surface of the J?.^^^^ hyo-glossus have been already enumerated ; and those be- ^^^c^^" neath the muscle are portions of both the genio hyo-glossus, and the middle constrictor, together with the lingual vessels. Along the anterior border is the genio-hyo-glossus muscle ; in con. , , , , . , y ^ , . tact with and beneath the posterior pass the ungual artery, the glosso- many pharyngeal nerve, and the stylo-hyoid ligament. The STYLO-GLOSSUS is a slender muscle, whose attachments styio- are expressed by its name.

To the posterior border the middle constrictor muscle is attached. It is frequently cartilaginous or osseous in part of, or in all its extent.109 INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. The INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY Supplies parts within the internal carotid head, viz. the brain and the eye and its appendages, and artery, takes a circuitous course through, and along the base of the skull before it terminates in the brain. Dissection. — The part of the arterial trunk in the base of some ^ parts the skull, and its offset to the orbit, have been already exa- already ' ^ seen, mined, but the part in the neck and the temporal bone remains to be dissected. Its branches to the brain are de- scribed with the encephalon. For the display of the cervical part of the artery there is ^^^^^^ now but little dissection required, since by detaching the styloid process at the root, and throwing it with its attached neck ; muscles to the middle line, the internal carotid artery and the jugular vein may be followed upwards to the skull. Only a dense fascia now conceals them, which is to be taken away carefully, so that the branches of the eighth and ninth nerves, that are in contact with the vessels near the base of the skull, may not be injured. In the fascia, and superficial to the artery near the skull, are the pharyngeal branch of the vagus, and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve and its branches; whilst the superior laryngeal branch of the vagus is beneath the carotid. Between the vein and artery, also near the skull, are the vagus, hypoglossal, and sympathetic nerves; and crossing backwards, over or under the vein, the spinal accessory nerve. External to the position of the vessels will be found a loop of the first and second cervical nerves, over the transverse process of the atlas, which communicates with the large ganglion of the sympathetic beneath the artery, and with the eighth and ninth nerves. Ascending to the cranium, on the inner side of the carotid, is the ascending pharyngeal artery. To open the carotid canal in the temporal bone, and to in the follow the contained artery into the cranium, make a cut bone, down the side of the skull in the following manner: — the saw being placed behind the mastoid process, cut forwards to the foramen spinosum in the wing of the sphenoid bone (to which spot the side of the skull has been already taken away), and let the instrument be directed through the stylo- mastoid foramen and the root of the styloid process, but rather external to the jugular foramen and the carotid canal. When the piece of detached bone has been taken away, the110 DISSECTION OF THE NECK. carotid canal maj be opened with the bone forceps. In dissecting the artery in the canal, large and rather red branches of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic will be found on it; and with care two small filaments may be recognised, — one from Jacobson's nerve, joining the sympathetic at the posterior part of the canal; the other from the vidian nerve, at the front of the canal.

This winding course is ^ t^..^^. first course oi the artery may be divided into three parts : — one part in the neck, another in the temporal bone, and a third inside the skull. through^ Cervical 'part.—In the neck the artery ascends almost the neck ygp^i^ally fi'om its Origin to the carotid canal, and is in con- tact with the pharynx on its inner side. Its depth from the surface varies as in the external carotid; and the line of the digastric muscle may be taken as the index of this difference, where it Thus, bclow that musclc, the internal carotid is contained in ficial be- the anterior triangular space, being overlapped by the sterno- mastoid, and covered by the common teguments, fascia, and platysma, and is on the same level as the external carotid, but deep though behind it. But, above that muscle, the vessel is above, pj^^g^ deeply beneath the external carotid artery and the parotid gland, and is crossed by the styloid process and the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve and its branches, and by the pharyngeal branch of the vagus resting nervc. Whilst in the neck the internal carotid lies on the us com,' rectus capitis anticus major muscle, which separates it from the vertebrae, also on the superior laryngeal and sympathetic within- nerves. Accompanying the artery is the internal jugular jugutar vein, which is placed on the outer side; and between the two vagu?" vessels is the pneumo-gastric nerve. This part of the artery remains much the same in size to the end, and usually does not furnish any branch.Ill INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN. Part in the temporal bone, — In the carotid canal the tor- second tuous course of the vessel commences. Following the wind- tempo"rai ing of its canal, the artery first ascends in front of the inner ear (cochlea and tympanum) ; next it is directed for- wards almost horizontally; and lastly it turns upwards into the cranium opposite the foramen lacerum (basis cranii). Branches of the sympathetic nerve surround the carotid sur- *' ^ rounded in the temporal bone. by sym- , .iT'iii pathetic. The cranial part of the artery is described with the base Third of the skull (see p. 22.). p"''* Peculiarities in the carotid.— The length of the internal carotid Pecu- ^ vessel varies in a given number of bodies, both from difference in in the length of the neck, and in the point of division of the common ^^"s^^' carotid trunk. The course of the vessel may be very tortuous, f^.irec. instead of being straight. It has been already said (p. 80.), that and'ori- the internal carotid may arise sometimes from the arch of the s"^- aorta. Further, this vessel may be absent from the neck : in such Absentee case the common carotid may take its place, and give the usual offsets of the external carotid. In one instance (Quain) where the artery was deficient in the neck, two branches of the internal maxillary entered the skull, and formed by their union a substi- tute for it in the cranium. The INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN is COntinUOUS with the internal lateral sinus of the skull, and extends from the foramen vein jugulare to the sterno-clavicular articulation. At the lower joins in- part of the neck it has been seen to join the subclavian, to subcia- . form the innominate vein (p. 80.). As far as the thyroid cartilage this vein accompanies the internal carotid, but below that point it is with the common carotid artery ; and is on it lies on the outer side of each. Its contiguity to the of caro- artery is not equally close in all its extent, for near the skull there is a small interval between them, containing the eighth and ninth nerves; and at the lower part of the neck there is a still larger intervening space, in which the pneumogastric nerve is found. The size of the vein remains much the same till near the os hyoides, where it is suddenly increased by the addition of those branches of the head and neck, branches , ^ ^ below corresponding with branches of the-external carotid artery, ^^g^^^^" that do not join the external jugular vein. The following branches open into the internal jugular, viz. the facial, lingual, thyroid (superior), occipital, and pharyngeal; andDISSECTION OF THE NECK. 112 at the lower part of the neck it receives the middle thyroid vein.

Let him then remove, bit by bit, with the bone forceps, or with a scalpel if the part has been softened, the ring of bone that bounds externally the jugular foramen, proceeding as far forwards as the crest of bone between the foramen and the aperture of the carotid canal. Between the ring of bone and the coat of the jugular vein, is the small auricular branch of the pneumo-gastric nerve, which is directed backwards to an aperture near the styloid process. * First trace the pneumo-gastric and spinal accessory foiiow nerves through the canal, by opening the fibrous sheath that gastric surrounds them. On the pneumo-gastric is a small ganglion, nai ac-' from which filaments are to be sought passing to the smaller and their portion of the spinal accessory nerve, and to the ascending es; branch of the upper cervical ganglion of the sympathetic; the auricular branch, before referred to, also takes origin from this ganglion. Two parts, large and small, of the spinal accessory nerve should be defined: the latter is to be shown joining the ganglion of the vagus, and then applying itself to the trunk of that nerve. A communication also exists between the two parts of the spinal accessory. * Next follow the glosso-pharyngeal nerve through the after- foramen, and take away any bone that overhangs it. This giosso- nerve presents two ganglia, as it passes from the skull: one seal (jugular), that is scarcely to be perceived, near the upper part of the tube of membrane that contains it; the other, much larger (petrous), is placed at the lower border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. From the lower one, and its seek a filament of communication with the sympathetic in the es. neck ; also Jacobson's nerve, that enters an aperture in, or on one side of the crest of bone between the jugular foramen and the carotid canal. Sometimes there will exist a filament from the lower ganglion to join the auricular branch of the pneumo-gastric, and another to end in the upper ganglion of the pneumo-gastric nerve. I114 DISSECTION OF THE NECK. Dissec- Below the foramen of exit from the skull, the eighth nerve the has been sufficiently denuded, by the dissection of the in- in the tcmal carotid, to examine its branches in the neck, with the exception of the inferior laryngeal nerve. But the connec- tions between the eighth, ninth, sympathetic, and first two spinal nerves should be traced out near the skull. Taking the pneumo-gastric nerve, it will be found to swell into a large oval body (lower ganglion), which is closely united with the hypoglossal, and is connected by branches with the other nerves. The hypoglossal nerve communicates also with the sympathetic and the spinal nerves. Lastly the student should trace the recurrent branch of the vagus from the lower part of the neck to the larynx. Eighth The EIGHTH CRANIAL NERVE (WiUis) consists of three distinct trunks, viz. glosso-pharyngeal, pneumo-gastric, and spinal accessory, which leave the cranium by the foramen jugulare (p. 21.).

Its upper Ganglia, — The jugular ganglion (gang, superius) is of very small size, and is situate at the upper part of the osseous groove that contains the nerve. It is placed at the outer aspect of the glosso-pharyngeal trunk, and includes only and some fibrils of the nerve. The petrosal ganglion (gang. gang- inferius), is much larger than the preceding, and encloses all the fibrils of the nerve. This ganglion is placed in a hollow in the lower border of the temporal bone, and from it arise the branches that unite the glosso-pharyngeal with the other nerves.GLOSSO-PHARYNGEAL NERVE. 115 I 2 After the nerve has quitted the foramen, it comes forwards in the between the jugular vein and the carotid artery, and crossing inwards over the artery, reaches the lower border of the stylo-pharyngeus muscle. At this spot, the nerve becomes courses almost transverse in direction in its course to the pha- tongue rynx; it passes over the stylo^pharyng eus, and forms an arch rynx. across the side of the neck (p. 66.), above the superior laryn- geal nerve. Finally the nerve enters beneath the hyo-glossus muscle, and ends in branches to the pharynx, the tongue, and the tonsil.

Vagus The PNEUMO-GASTRic NERVE (vagus n^rve) is the largest of the three trunks of the eighth cranial nerve (Willis), and occupies the same sheath of dura mater as the spinal acces- in fora- sorj in the jugular foramen. In the foramen it has a dis- guiare, tiuct gangliou (gang, of the root), to which the smaller part of the spinal accessory nerve is connected. and in When the nerve has escaped from the foramen, it receives the neck, ^ \ the small part of the spinal accessory, and swells into a large ganglion (gang, of the trunk). Here the nerve lies between the carotid artery and the jugular vein, and communicates with the several nerves at this part. To reach tho thorax, courses the vaffus descends, almost vertically, between the internal to the . . . , ^ . ^ thorax, jugular vcin and the internal and common carotid arteries, and enters that cavity, on the right side, by crossing over the subclavian artery. ^an<-ii Gctnglia,—The ganglion of the root (gang, superius) is of in fo- a greyish colour, and in texture is like the ganglion on the large root of the fifth nerve.

It gives offsets to join the pharyngeal and upper laryngeal branches of the vagus ; and according to Bendz, offsets from it may be traced into many other branches of the same nerve.119 HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE. The spinal part is much larger, is round and cord-like, spinai and is connected with the smaller piece, whilst it is passing foramen, through the foramen jugulare. Beyond the foramen the nerve takes a backward course in the through the sterno-mastoid muscle, and across the side of the ^^^^'^^^ neck to the trapezius muscle.

If it is thought necessary, the two cranial nerves may be cut across close to the skull. The several branches of the ganglion should be traced upwards, inwards, and outwards. The dissector has already seen the middle ganglion on or Middle . near the inferior thyroid artery, and has now to trace out its branches. To obtain a view of the inferior ganglion, the greater part i of the first rib is to be taken away, and a part of the sub- gan- clavian artery is to be removed, without however destroy- ing the fine nerves that pass over it. Of course the clavicle is supposed not to be in position. The ganglion is placed on the neck of the first rib ; its branches are large, and are easily followed to the vertebral artery, the spinal nerves, and the thorax. The SUPERIOR CERVICAL GANGLION is the largest of the superior cervical ganglia, and is of a reddish grey colour.

The second and third parts of the artery, viz. beneath and Rest of beyond the scalenus, are nearly the same as on the right side ; tery. but the student must note for himself the variations that may exist in the connections. The branches of this artery resemble so closely those of Branch- the right trunk, that one description will serve for both. It sembie may be remarked, that the superior intercostal of the left right side is usually internal to, instead of beneath the scalenus; in other words, this branch arises sooner (see p. 75.). The thoracic duct conveys the chyle and lymph of the Thoracic greater part of the body into the venous circulation. Es- ^^^^^ caping from the thorax between the subclavian artery and [^o^ax the oesophagus, the duct ascends in the neck as high as the seventh or sixth cervical vertebra. At the spot mentioned as its highest extent, the duct arches outwards above the subclavian artery, and in front of the scalenus muscle and the phrenic nerve, to open into the subclavian vein rather and joins external to the union of this with the jugular vein. Double v^an^^ valves, like those of the veins, are present in the interior of the tube ; and two guard the opening into the posterior part of the vein, to prevent the passage of the blood into it.

It consists of two lobel^ lobes, one on each side, which are united by a narrow piece by across the front of the windpipe. The connecting piece, about half an inch in depth, is named the isthmus, and is placed opposite the second and third rings of the air tube. Each lobe is somewhat conical in shape, with the smaller connec- end uDwards, and is about two inches in length. It is inter- tionsand ^ posed between the windpipe and the sheath of the common carotid artery, and is covered by the sterno-thyroid, sterno- extent of hyoid, and omo-hyoid muscles. The extent of the lobe ° depends upon the variations in its size; but usually the lateral piece reaches as high as the ala of the thyroid carti- lage, and as low as the sixth ring of the trachea.

It has a granular texture. The substance of the gland consists of spherical or Consists elongated vesicles, which vary in size, some being as large cies^r^" as the head of a small pin, and others only g^^th of an inch. These vesicles are simple sacs, distinct from one another, and contain a yellow fluid, with nuclear-like bodies; in the yeiiow wall of the vesicles is found a thin proper membrane with a nucleated epithelial lining. Capillary vessels and con- and nective tissue unite the vesicles together into small irre- bodied gular masses or lobules, of the size of the little finger nail. On cutting into the gland a viscid yellowish fluid escapes. Bloodvessels.— The arteries to the thyroid body are two on each Blood- side — superior and inferior thyroid; and occasionally there is an additional branch — lowest thyroid, from the innominate artery. The branches of the external carotid (superior thyroid) ramify Supe- chiefly on the anterior aspect; while those from the subclavian ferfor,"" (inferior thyroid) pierce the under surface of the thyroid body, esuhy^" A very free communication is established between all the arteries; [edes^" * and in the substance of the thyroid body the arteries form a fine network around the vesicles, and so pass into the capillary radicles of the veins. The veins are also large and numerous; they are superior, Veins, middle, and inferior thyroid on each side. The first two have been traced to the internal jugular vein (p. 111.). The inferior thyroid inferior veins^ two in number, issue from the lower part of the thyroid p'le^us body, and descend on the trachea, the two forming a plexus on t"achea. that tube beneath the sterno-thyroid muscles; each finally enters the innominate vein of its own side.

The cardiac nerves are three in number on the left, as on Cardiac the right side, viz. superior, middle, and inferior, but they present some peculiarities. The superior cardiac nerve has on both sides a similar course in Upper, the neck; but the left in entering the chest is between the carotid and subclavian arteries, and parallel to them. The middle cardiac nerve frequently unites with the next nerve, Middle, and passes beneath the subclavian artery to the deep cardiac plexus. The inferior cardiac nerve is generally a small branch that enters Lower, the thorax conjoined with the preceding, and ends in the cardiac plexus. Section XL DISSECTION OF THE PHARYNX. The pharynx, or the commencement of the alimentary passage, can be examined only when it has been separated from the rest of the body; and it will therefore be necessary to cut through the base of the skull in the manner mentioned below, so as to have the anterior half, with the pharynx connected to it, detached from the posterior half. Dissection,—Preparatory to sawing the skull certain other To de- steps are needed. In the first place, the block being re- pharynx moved from beneath the neck, the head is to be placed down- wards, so that it may stand on the cut surface of the skull. Next the trachea and oesophagus, together with the vagus K130 DISSECTION OF THE PHARYNX. and sympathetic nerves, are to be cut near the first rib (should these be still uncut), and all are to be separated from the spine as high as the basilar process of the occipital bone, but without disturbing, on the left side, the vessels and nerves near the skull, partly For the division of the skull, let the dissector chisel through divide ■ . . ^ base^of^ the basilar process of the occipital bone, betv^een the attach- ternaiiy, mcuts of the pharjux and the muscles of the spinal column, the cut being directed backwards.

The margins of the two lower constrictor ;i muscles (middle and inferior) are to be defined. Beneath {;THE PHARYNX. 131 the lower one, near the larynx, will be found the recurrent nerve; whilst, intervening between the middle and superior, are the stylo-pharyngeus muscle and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. To see the attachment of the superior constrictor to the lower jaw and the pterygo-maxillary ligament, it will be necessary to cut through the internal pterygoid muscle. Above the upper fibres of this constrictor, and near the base of the skull (petrous part of the temporal bone), will be found two small muscles of the palate : — one, — tensor palati, lies between the internal pterygoid plate and the pterygoid muscle; and the other, — levator palati, is rather farther back, and of larger size. The PHARYNX is that part of the alimentary tube which Pharynx is behind IS Situate behind the nose, mouth, and larynx. Through mouth the upper part of this passage, besides the food, the air is nose, transmitted in respiration. Its extent is from the base of Extent, the skull to the cricoid cartilage of the larynx, where it ends in the oesophagus. In form it is somewhat conical, with the fo™, base or dilated part upwards, and the apex or narrower part downwards. In length it measures about four inches and a length, half.

On each side of the pharynx are the trunks is be- ef the carotid arteries, with the internal jugular vein and the biood- accompanying eighth, ninth, and sympathetic nerves. Be- in hind it is the spinal column, covered by the deep muscles, fp^ne viz. longus colli and rectus capitis anticus major. In front the pharynx is attached to the larynx, the hyoid ^^^^p^- bone, and the tongue, and to the bony framework of the nasal cavity; but behind it is unattached, and is formed of thin, fleshy and membranous strata. In the posterior wall are three thin muscles, which are so arranged that the lower overlays the middle, and the middle the upper muscle, like the disposition of scales ; and at the upper part the bag is farther completed by an aponeurotic expansion which fixes it to the base of the skull. The whole is lined by mucous membrane. The aponeurosis of attachment is seen at the upper part of ^^9^^"^' the pharynx, where the muscular fibres are deficient, to con- pharynx: nect the muscular part to the base of the skoU, and to com-132 DISSECTION OF THE PHARYNX. plete the posterior boundary. Superiorly, it is fixed to the basilar process of the occipital bone, and the petrous part of the temporal bone, as well as to the cartilage between them; but inferiorly it becomes thin, and extends between the muscular and mucous strata. On this membrane some of the fibres of the constrictor muscles terminate. Lower The INFERIOR CONSTRICTOR, the most Superficial of the constnc- ' ^ tor mus- muscles of the pharynx, m^ises from the side of the cricoid from* cartilage, from the oblique line and the upper and lower larynx bordcrs of the ala of the thyroid cartilage, and from the and ends part of the last cartilage behind that line. The origin is middle small when compared with the insertion, for the fibres are directed backwards, radiating, and are inserted along the middle line, where it meets the corresponding muscle of the Parts in opposite side. The outer surface of the muscle is in contact w^tK with the sheath of the carotid artery, and with the muscles covering the spinal column. The lower border is straight* and is continuous with the fibres of the oesophagus ; whilst the upper border overlaps the fibres of the middle con- strictor. The recurrent nerve enters beneath the lower border. Middle The MIDDLE CONSTRICTOR MUSCLE has nearly the same tor"^*^"^ shape as the preceding, that is to say, it is narrow in front passes and expanded behind. Its fibres arise from the great cornu oid bon e of the OS hyoides, from the small cornu of the same bone, middue and from the stylo-hyoid ligament. From this origin the behind, fibres radiate, and are blended along the middle line with the other muscles. The surfaces of the muscle have con- connec- ncctious similar to those of the preceding constrictor. The upper border is separated from the superior constrictor by the stylo-pharyngeus muscle and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and ends on the aponeurosis of the pharynx, about an inch from the base of the skull. The lower border descends beneath the inferior constrictor; and opposite the interval between the two is the superior laryngeal nerve, stylo- The stylo-pharyngeus muscle may be again seen with the g?ul.^"" pharynx.

The upper border consists of the arched fibres which are directed backwards from the pterygoid plate, and above it the levator and tensor palati muscles are seen.

It is narrow superiorly, where it is fixed to the margins of a groove between the sphenoid and the petrous has a part of the temporal bone ; directed downwards to the opening; pharynx, it ends by a wide aperture opposite the inner surface of the internal pterygoid plate, and rather above the inferior spongy bone of the nose. Its opening in the pharynx is oval in form; and the inner side, which is larger than the outer, projects forward, giving rise to a trumpet-shaped is a bent moutli. This part of the tube is constructed chiefly by a cartf.^ triangular piece of cartilage, whose margins are bent down- ^^^^ wards so as to enclose a narrow space ; but at the outer and under aspect the cartilage is deficient, and the wall is formed Mucous by fibrous membrane. Closely united to the pterygoid brane plafcc, the tubc is covered by the mucous membrane ; and andTnes through it the mucous lining of the cavity of the tympanum is continuous with that of the pharynx. Opening The istlimus faucium is a somewhat narrowed passage be- fLcel tween the mouth and the fauces, whose size is altered by the elevated or pendent position of the soft palate. The space is bounded below by the root of the tongue ; above by the soft palate ; and on each side by those projecting arches of the soft palate, which are named pillars of the fauces.VELUM PENDULUM PALATI. 135 The aperture of the larynx is wide in front, where it is Upper bounded bj the epiglottis, and pointed behind between the oria-"^ arjtaenoid cartilages. The sides are sloped from before back, ' and are formed by folds of the mucous membrane extending between the arjtsenoid cartilages and the epiglottis. During respiration this aperture is unobstructed, but during the act of deglutition it is closed by the epiglottis. The opening into the oesophagus is the narrowest part of Begin- the pharynx, and is opposite the cricoid cartilage, or the resolha- fifth cervical vertebra. Internally, the mucous membrane in the oesophagus is paler than in the pharynx; and exter- nally, the point at which the pharynx ends is marked^ by a slight contraction, and by a change in the direction of the muscular fibres. The SOFT PALATE (vclum pendulum palati) is a moveable soft pa- structure between the mouth and the pharynx, which can Lade of ^ either close the isthmus of the fauces, or cut off the passage ""^"'^ » to the nose, according as it is depressed or elevated. In tho usual position of the soft palate (the state of relaxation) the anterior surface is somewhat curved, and is continuous with surfaces, the roof of the mouth, whilst the opposite surface is convex and turned to the pharynx. The upper border is fixed to borders; the posterior margin of the hard palate; and each lateral part joins the pharynx. The lower border is free, and pre- from it sents in the centre a conical pendulous part — the uvula, Svufa^. Along the middle line is a slight prominence, indicative of the original separation into two halves. Springing from the lower part of the soft palate, near to Arches the uvula, are two folds on each side, containing muscular pliiars; fibres, which are directed downwards on the sides of the isthmus faucium. These are named arches or pillars of the palate, and are distinguished from one another by their relative position. The anterior one reaches the side of the anterior, tongue near its root; and the posterior, longer than the other, is continued to the side of the pharynx. As they r\ot^ diverge from their origin to their insertion, they limit a triangular space, in which the tonsil lies. The velum consists of an aponeurosis, together with Eie- muscles, vessels and nerves, and mucous glands ; and the veium, whole is enveloped by the mucous membrane. K 4136 DISSECTION OF THE PHARYNX. Bissec- Dissection.— Some of the muscles of the palate are readily tion of . . . . the mus- displayed, but others require great care m their dissection. Levator ^'^^^ right side, the two principal muscles of the soft tensor Palate — the elevator and tensor, are to be seen. These have haif!^^* been partly dissected on the outside of the pharynx, but to follow them to their termination, let the upper attachment of the pharynx on the same side, and the part of the superior constrictor which arises from the internal pterygoid plate, be cut through. The levator will be fully laid bare by the removal of the mucous membrane and the muscular fibres covering its lower part; and the tendon of the tensor palati should be followed round thehamular process of the pterygoid plate. The position of the Eustachian tube with respect to those muscles should be defined. On left. On the left side, the mucous membrane is to be raised pharyn- with carc from the posterior surface of the palate, to obtain a view of the superficial submucous fibres ; for immediately beneath the mucous covering are some transverse fibres of the palato-pharyngeus muscle; and beneath these, in the azygos middle line, are the longitudinal fibres of the azygos uvulje. The student should next remove the mucous membrane from the muscular fibres constituting the arches of the palate, and should follow them upwards and downwards: in order to see those of the anterior fold, it will be necessary and to take the membrane from the anterior surface of the palate. gToslr If the part is not tolerably fresh, some of the paler fibres will not be visible. Aponeu- Aponeurosis of the soft palate.— Giving strength to the palate.^ vclum is a thin but firm aponeurosis, which is attached to the hard palate. This membrane becomes thinner as it descends in the velum ; and it is joined by the tendon of the tensor palati muscle. Mine The MUSCLES of the soft palate are four on each side, — an muscles. ^jgyg^^Qj, g^^d tcusor ; together with the palato-glossus and palato-pharyngeus, which act as depressors. In addition there is a small central azygos muscle. Elevator The LEVATOR PALATI is a thick, roundish muscle, and is Tri^ses^ partly situate outside the pharynx. It arises from the under pharynx, surfacc of the apcx of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and from the inner and under part of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube. The fibres descending, enter the137 MUSCLES OF THE PALATE. pharynx above the superior constrictor, and then spread out in the soft palate, where they join along the middle line with those of the muscle of the opposite side. Outside the ^J^^^is pharynx this muscle rests against the Eustachian tube. In ^eium. the palate it forms a stratum that reaches the whole depth of that structure, and is embraced by the two planes of fibres of the palato-pharyngeus. The TENSOR vel circumflexus palati arises like the pre- Tensor ^ jnuscle ceding outside the palate and pharynx: it is a thin, riband- like band, which is tendinous at its deep border, and is situate between the internal pterygoid plate and the ptery- goid muscle. The muscle is about one inch and a half arises ^ ^ ^ ^ . outside wide at its origin, and is attached to the slight depression pharynx, (scaphoid fossa) at the root of the internal pterygoid plate, to the outer part of the Eustachian tube, and still farther out to the spinous process of the sphenoid, and to the front of the vaginal (tympanic) process of the temporal bone. Inferiorly the fleshy fibres end in a tendon, which is reflected turns around round the hamular process, and is mserted into about half ^amuiar ^ process, an inch of the posterior border of the palate, viz. from the central spine to a projecting point; whilst inferiorly the tendon joins the aponeurosis of the velum. As the tendon and ends .in apo- winds round the bone, it is thrown into folds ; and in the neurosis; soft palate it lies beneath the levator muscle. The Eus- is deeper 1-T 1 * 1-1 1 ' t T than the tachian tube is directed inwards between this muscle and other, the preceding one. Between the tendon and the hamular process is a small bursa. The PALATO-GLOSSUS muscle (constrictor isthmi faucium) Paiato- . . . . glossus. IS a small, fleshy band of fibres, which is contained in the anterior arch of the soft palate, and reaches to the side of the tongue. The muscles of opposite sides narrow the opening between the mouth and fauces, hence the name that has been applied to them. It is connected inferiorly with the lateral Attach. . ments. surface and the dorsum of the tongue; from this spot the fibres ascend before the tonsil, to the anterior aspect of the soft palate, where they form a thin muscular stratum, and join those of the fellow muscle along the middle line. At its origin the muscle is blended with the glossal muscles, and at its insertion it is placed before the tensor palati. The PALATO-PHARYNGEUS is much larger in size than the Paiato- T n 1 pharyn- preceding muscle; it gives rise to the eminence of the pos- geus,138 DISSECTION OF THE PHARYNX. in pillar terior pillar of the soft palate, and bounds the tonsil pos- paiate. teriorlj. The muscle arises inferiorly from the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage, and some fibres blend with the contiguous portion of the pharynx. Ascending thence Attach- behind the tonsil, the fibres enter the side of the palate, and ments. ' ^ ' separate into two fleshy strata. The posterior of the two, thin and in contact with the mucous membrane, joins at the middle line the corresponding m^uscle. The deeper or an- terior stratum, much the strongest, enters the substance of the palate between the levator and tensor, and joins also, at the middle line, the like part of the opposite muscle. In the palate the muscle encloses the levator palati and azygos uvulae between its two strata.

Tonsil The tonsil is a collection of muciparous follicles close above tween the basc of the tongue, and between the arches of the soft pillars of 7 . . , . . palate, palate. It IS roundish m shape, but variable in size, and the apertures of the follicles are more or less apparent on its surface. Externally the tonsil is opposite the superior con- strictor muscle, and the angle of the lower jaw; and when enlarged it may press against the carotid blood-vessels. Vessels. Its arteries are numerous and are derived from the facial, lin- gual, ascending pharyngeal, and internal maxillary branches of the external carotid; and its veins have a plexiform arrangement on Nerves, its outer side. Nerves are furnished to it from the fifth and eighth cranial nerves. Mucous The mucous membrane of the pharynx is continuous an- bJa^ie of teriorly with the lining of the mouth and nose.

Inferiorly, it is continued hj the oesophagus to the stomach.

Its epithelium is scaly below the palate, that is to say, in the part through which the food passes; but columnar and ciliated above that spot, where only the air is transmitted. Beginning of the oesophagus,— In addition to what has Begin- been said of the commencement of the oesophagus, and its oesopha- gus. connections in the neck, it may be remarked, that the size of this tube is less than that of the pharynx, and that the walls are flaccid. On dissection the tube will be found to consist of two Formed of two layers of muscular fibres, with a lining of mucous mem- layers of , *^ ' ° fibres; brane. The external layer is formed of longitudinal fibres; these outer or begin opposite the cricoid cartilage by three bundles, ante- dinlu^ rior and two lateral;—the former is attached to the ridge at the back of the cartilage, and the others join the inferior constrictor. The internal layer, on the other hand, is formed and in- . . ner or of circular fibres, which are continuous with those of the circular, constrictor. The structure of the oesophagus is described more fully in the dissection of the thorax. Section XII. CAVITY OF THE MOUTH. The cheeks, the lips, and the teeth, are to be examined with the mouth, as all may be considered accessory parts. The Mouth. — The cavity of the mouth is situate below Mouth, that of the nose, and extends from the lips in front to the isthmus of the fauces behind. Its boundaries are partly situa- . tion, osseous and partly muscular, and its size depends upon the position of the lower jaw. When the lower jaw is moder- form, ately removed from the upper one, the mouth is an oval cavity with the following boundaries. The roof is concave, and140 DISSECTION OF THE MOUTH. bounda- and is formed by tlie hard and soft palate, and is limited anteriorly bj the arch of the teeth. In the floor is the tongue, bounded bj the arch of the lower teeth; and beneath the tip of that body is the frgenum linguae, with the sub- lingual gland on each side. Each lateral boundary consists of the cheek and the ramus of the lower jaw ; and in it, near the second molar tooth in the upper jaw, is the opening of the parotid duct. The anterior opening of the mouth is bounded by the lips, and the posterior corresponds to the pillars of the soft palate. Lining Tiie mucous membrane of the mouth is much thicker on mouth the hard than the soft parts bounding the cavity ; it lines the interior of the cavity, and is reflected over the tongue. Anteriorly it is contiguous with the tegument, and poste- riorly with the lining of the pharynx, differs in On tracing its disposition, the membrane is seen to form "^^^^^^ a small fold — frsenulum, between each lip and the front of on roof, the corresponding jaw. On the bony part of the roof it is thick and thrown into folds, and covers vessels, nerves, and glands ; but on the soft palate it is smooth and thinner. Along the middle of the palate is a ridge, which ends in floor, front in a small papilla. In the floor of the mouth, the membrane forms the frsenum linguae beneath the tip of the tongue, and sends tubes into the openings of the Whartonian and sublingual ducts; whilst on each side of the fraenum it cheek, is raiscd into a ridge by the subjacent sublingual gland. On and hps. interior of the cheek and lips the mucous lining is smooth, and is separated from the muscles by small buccal and labial glands in addition to the ordinary submucous tissue. Over the whole oral cavity, but especially on the lips, are found Epithe- papillae for the purpose of touch. The epithelium covering hum. ^1^^ membrane is of the scaly variety. Cheek; The CHEEK cxtcuds from the commissure of the lips to the extent ramus of the lower jaw, and is attached, above and below, to the alveolar process of the jaws on the outer aspect. The and chief constituent of the cheek is the fleshy part of the bucci- tur"^* nator muscle: on the inner surface of this is the mucous membrane ; and on the outer the integuments, with some muscles, vessels, and nerves. The parotid duct perforates the cheek near the second molar tooth of the upper jaw, and receives a lining of the mucous membrane.DISSECTION OF THE NOSE. 141 The LIPS surround the opening of the mouth; they consist Lips, of the fleshy part of the orbicularis oris muscle, covered ex- formed ternallj by integument, and internallj by mucous membrane, cuiaris; The lower lip is the larger and more moveable of the two. Between the muscular structure and the mucous covering are the labial glands ; and in the substance of the lip, nearer the inner than the outer surface, and at the line of junction of contains the two parts of the orbicularis, is the arch of the coronary arter"y^/^ artery. Teeth.—In the adult there are sixteen teeth in each jaw, Teeth, which are set in the alveolar border of the maxilla, in the number and ar- form of an arch, and are surrounded by the o^ums. Each range- . , n mentin dental arch has its convexity turned forwards; and, commonly, jaw; the arch in the upper overhangs that in the lower maxilla when the jaws are in contact. The teeth are similar in the half of each jaw, and have received the following names: — the most anterior two are incisors, and the one next behind different is the canine tooth; two, still farther back, are the bicus- pids, and the last three are molar teeth. Moreover, the last molar tooth has been also called " dens sapientiae," from the late period of its appearance. The names applied to the Use m teeth indicate very nearly the part they perform in masti- ^io"- cation; thus the incisor and canine teeth act as dividers of the food, whilst the bicuspid and molar teeth serve to grind the aliment. The several parts of the teeth, viz. the crown, fane:, and F^iiev 11 •11 n notice neck; the general and special characters of these parts, and else, of the different groups of the teeth ; and the structure of the different components of a tooth, must be referred to else- where.* Section XIII. DISSECTION OF THE NOSE. To obtain a view of the interior of the nose, it will be ne- Direc- cessary to make a longitudinal section through the base of the skull. Whilst the student is examining the boundaries of the nose, he should be provided with a vertical section of a skull. * For this information the student naay refer to the account of the teeth that has been given by Dr. Sharpej, in Quain's Anatomy.DISSECTION OF THE NOSE. 142 Dissec- ^ Dissection, — Before making the necessary sawing of the fore saw-bone, the loose part of the lower jaw on the right side ing bone. should be taken away; further, the tongue, hyoid bone, and larynx, all united, may be detached from the opposite half of the lower jaw, and laid aside till the dissector is ready to use them. Cut The saw being placed on the right side of the crista galli tbeTone ^f the ethmoid bone, is to be carried vertically through the frontal and nasal bones, the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, and part of the body of the sphenoid bone. Now the roof of the mouth is to be turned upwards, and the soft parts are to be divided on the right of the median line, opposite the cut in the roof of the nose; and the saw is then to be carried through the hard palate on the right side of the septum nasi, and through the body of the sphenoid bone, in such a direction as to make the cut join the incision from above. The piece of the skull is now easily separated into two parts, right and left; and by proceeding as above directed, the delicate bones of the nose are less injured than they would be by sawing continuously in one direction. The right half will serve for the examination of the meatuses, and the left will show the septum nasi, situa. The CAVITY OF THE NOSE is placed in the centre of the riose.^^ bones of the face, being situate above the mouth, and between the orbits and the sinuses of the superior maxillary Division bones. This space is divided into two parts—nasal fossae, into two. ^ vertical partition. Form, Each fossa is larger below than above; and is flattened in form, so that the measurement from before back or above Open- down, exceeds much that from within out. It communicates with both the face and the pharynx by apertures named nares, and has also apertures of communication with the sinuses in the surrounding bones, viz. frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and superior maxillary. In each fossa are a roof and floor, an inner and an outer wall, and an anterior and a posterior opening, which are to be examined. Koof. The roof is somewhat arched, and is formed by the cribri- form plate of the ethmoid bone in the centre; by the frontal and nasal bones and the cartilages in front; and by the body of the sphenoid, the sphenoidal spongy bone, and part of the palate bone at the posterior part. Many apertures exist in143 MEATUSES OF THE NOSE. the ethmoid bone for the passage of the olfactory nerves, and in the front of the body of the sphenoid is the opening of its sinus. The floor is slightly hollowed from side to side, and in it Floor, are found the palate and superior maxillary bones — their palate processes. Near the front is the incisor foramen leading to the anterior palatine fossa. The inner boundary (septum nasi) is partly osseous and inner partly cartilaginous, and will be seen when the lining dary membrane has been removed. The osseous part is con- partly structed by the vomer, by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, and by those parts of the frontal and nasal, with which this last bone articulates above. The irregular partly cartila- space in front in the prepared skull is filled by the triangular ginous. cartilage of the septum^ which forms part of the partition between the nostrils, and supports the cartilages of the ante- rior aperture. Fixed between the vomer, the ethmoid plate, and the nasal bones, the cartilage rests anteriorly on the median ridge between the superior maxillse, and projects even between the cartilages of each nostril. The septum nasi is commonly bent to one side. The outer boundary has the greatest extent and the most Outer irregular surface. Six bones enter into the formation of dary, this wall, and they come in the following order, when enu- merated from before backwards:—the nasal and superior maxillary; the lateral mass of the ethmoid bone, with the small OS unguis; and posteriorly the ascending part of the formed palate bone, with the internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid boiTes"^ bone: of these, the nasal, ungual, and ethmoidal reach only about half way from roof to floor, whilst the others extend the whole depth. Altogether in front of the bones, the lateral cartilages may be said to construct part of this boundary. On this wall are three convoluted osseous pieces, named is irre- spongy or turbinate bones, which project into the cavity: — surface ; the two upper are processes of the ethmoid, but the lower one is the inferior spongy bone.

Upper The upper one is the smallest of the three meatuses, and or mea- occupies about the posterior half of the outer boundary: into it the posterior ethmoidal sinuses open at the front; and at its posterior part, in the dried bone, is the spheno-palatine foramen, by which the nerves and vessels enter the nose. middle. The middle meatus is longer than the preceding, and reaches about two-thirds of the length of the outer wall. It com- municates anteriorly by a funnel-shaped passage (infundibu- lum) with the frontal sinus and the anterior ethmoidal cells; and near its middle is a small oblique aperture, about the size of a crow-quill^ that leads into the cavity of the upper jaw. lower. The inferior meatus equals in length four-fifths of the outer wall of the nasal fossa; in its front is the opening of the ductus ad nasum, and nearly on a level with but behind it, the Eustachian tube may be seen. Nares. The nares. In the recent condition of the nose, each fossa has a distinct anterior opening in the face, and another in the pharynx; but in the skeleton there is only one com- mon opening, in front, for both sides. These apertures, and the parts bounding them, have been before described (p. 33 and 134.) Mucous The mucous membrane that lines the nasal fossa is called oTthI the pituitary or Schneiderian membrane. It is continuous with the integument at the nostrils, and with the membrane lining the pharynx through the posterior opening: more- over, it is also continuous, by means of the openings into the meatuses, with that of the tympanum and the eyeball, and that of the different sinuses, viz. frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoidal, and maxillary.

United to the subjacent periosteum and perichondrium, and on the margins of the spongy bones it is projected somewhat by the large submucous vessels, so as to increase the extent of surface; but in the canals and sinuses it is very thin. Near the nostril it is furnished with papillas, and small hairs Some fo- (vibrissas).

From the close connection of the mucous membrane with the pe- riosteum, the lining membrane of the nose is sometimes called a fibro-mucous structure. The surface is covered by the apertures of muciparous Aper- /» . tures of glands, which are in greatest abundance, and of largest size, giand about the middle and posterior parts of the nasal fossa. In theiium. the lower part of the nose, and in the sinuses, its epithelium is of the columnar ciliated kind, which becomes laminated or scaly near the nostrils; but has special characters in the upper part of the cavity. Olfactory region.'^— This is the part of the nose in which pifac- the olfactory nerve is distributed, and is therefore the seat of region.: the sense of smell. In this spot the mucous lining differs from that in the lower portion of the nose. This region is situate at the top of the nasal cavity, and Limits, is confined to the surface of the roof formed by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone; to a portion of the outer wall constructed by the upper, and part of the middle spongy bone; and to a corresponding extent of the septum, viz. about one third. The epithelium of the mucous membrane covering this Epithe- region is of a brownish tint, is laminar, and is composed of many strata. The glands of the part resemble further those glands, of ordinary sweat glands in their position, and in the length and condition of the excretory tubes. Dissection.—By the time the student has arrived at this Dissec- stage of the dissection, little will be seen of the distribution nerves of the olfactory nerve. If the septum nasi be removed, so seis. as to leave entire the membrane covering it on the opposite side (the left), the filaments of the nerve will appear on the surface, near the cribriform plate. On the membrane too, near the front of the septum, is a branch of the nasal nerve. At the same time the naso-palatine nerve and artery may be seen lower down, being directed from behind forwards, * This region has been specially described in the third part of the Physiological Anatomy of Dr. Todd and Mr. Bowman.DISSECTION OF THE HEAD. 146 towards the anterior palatine fossa.

Dissection, — The branches of the ganglion that enter the seek branches nose will be found on the left part of the sawn skull, by to the seeking them opposite the spheno-palatine foramen, through which they enter the nasal fossa with corresponding arteries. One of these nerves (naso-palatine), before referred to as lying in the membrane of the septum, is to be isolated from the pituitary membrane, and followed forwards to where it enters the floor of the nose. Branches of the internal max- illary artery accompany the nerves, and are to be dissected with them. To lay bare the nerves that descend to the palate, the branches posterior part of the mucous membrane detached from the palate, septum of the nose, and that lining the nasal fossa behind the spongy bones, should be taken away. After this has been removed, the palatine nerves and vessels will be seen through the thin translucent palate bone, and will be readily reached by breaking carefully through the bone with a chisel. Afterwards the tube of membrane that contains the vessels and nerves is to be opened ; and these are to be followed down to the soft palate and roof of the mouth, and then onwards towards the incisor teeth. The palatine body of nerves will lead upwards to the ganglion, which is close to guon; the body of the sphenoid bone. But to bring the ganglion fully into view, it will be necessary to saw through the over- hanging part of the sphenoid bone, to cut away pieces of the bones surrounding the hollow in which it lies, and to remove with care the enveloping fat and the periosteum. The ganglion may be then seen to be a small reddish-looking body, from which the vidian nerve passes backwards. To trace backwards the vidian branch to the carotid plexus vidian and the facial nerve, the student must lay open the canal which contains it in the root of the pterygoid process; and in doing this he must be careful of a small pharyngeal branch of nerve and artery that are superficial to the vidian, and lie in the pterygo-palatine canal. At the back of the pterygoid canal, a small branch from the vidian to the carotid plexus is to be looked for. Lastly, the vidian nerve is to be followed into the skull by cutting away the point of148 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD. the petrous part of the temporal bone, and the internal carotid artery; and is to be pursued on the surface of the temporal bone, beneath the ganglion of the fifth nerve, to the hiatus Fallopii.

Whilst has in its canal, the nerve furnishes two or more filaments (inferior es to nasal) to the membrane on the middle and lower spongy bones; and, in the roof of the mouth, it supplies the mucous membrane and glands, and gives an offset to the soft palate. h. The small palatine nerve (posterior) lies in the smaller canal, small, and ends inferiorly in the soft palate and the levator palati muscle; it supplies the uvula and tonsil. c. The external palatine nerve is smaller than the other two, and external descends in the canal of the same name. Leaving the canal, the nerve is distributed to the velum palati and the tonsil. Branches to the nose, — The nasal branches, from three to Nasai five in number, are for the most part very small and soft, are and pass inwards through the spheno-palatine foramen. One of these is the naso-palatine nerve. Their distribution is mentioned below. a. The superior nasal branches (anterior) are distributed in the superior mucous membrane on the two upper spongy bones, and a few fila- ments reach the back part of the septum nasi. b. The naso-palatine nerve (nerve of Cotunnius) crosses the roof Naso- of the nasal fossa to reach the septum nasi, and descends on this P^^^tme. partition to near the front. The nerve now enters a special canal, by the side of the septum, that of the left side of the body being anterior to the other, and is conveyed to the roof of the mouth, where it lies in the centre of the anterior palatine fossa. Finally, the nerves of opposite sides are united in the mouth, and are dis- tributed in the mucous membrane behind the incisor teeth; at their distribution they are connected with the great palatine nerves. On the septum nasi filaments are supplied by the naso-palatine nerve to the mucous membrane. To follow the nerve to its termi- nation, the canal in the roof of the mouth ought to be opened. The posterior branches are two : a pharyngeal branch, Branch- and the vidian nerve. wards are a. The pharyngeal branch is very small, and is directed through to pha- the pterygo-palatine canal to the mucous membrane of the pharynx near the Eustachian tube, in which it ends. b.

Directions. — The student may nov^ direct his attention to the remaining nerves and vessels that are distributed in the nasal cavity. Seek Dissection, — The nasal nerve is to be sought in the nose nerves behind the nasal bone, by gently detaching the lining mem- seis of brane, after having cut off the projecting bone. A branch is given from the nerve to the septum nasi, but probably this and the trunk of the nerve vrill be seen but imperfectly in the present condition of the part. The terminal branches of the internal maxillary artery with its veins in the spheno- maxillary fossa are to be completely traced out. Nasal The nasal nerve (of the ophthalmic) has been already seen in the orbit and skull, and at its termination in the face (p. 47.) ; and the part that connects the two through the lies be- nose is now to be learned. Entering the nasal fossa by an nasal apcrturc at the front of the ethmoid bone, the nerve gives a gives' branch to the membrane of the septum of the nose, and is then continued in a groove behind the os nasi to the lower margin of this bone, where it escapes to the surface of the nose. branch Branches.— The branch to the septum divides into filaments that tum^ ramify on the anterior part of that partition, and reach nearly to the lower border. and to One or two filaments are likewise furnished by the nerve to the wall. mucous membrane of the fore part of the outer wall of the nasal fossa; these extend as low as the inferior spongy bone.

The superior or descending palatine is the largest branch of PJ^^*;ij® the artery in the fossa, and accompanies the large palatine nerve in its canal. Arrived at the palate, the vessel is directed forwards in the roof of the mouth, and anastomoses, behind the incisor teeth, with the artery of the opposite side, and with a branch that descends from the nose through the anterior palatine fossa. In its course the artery supplies branches to the other palatine canals, which pass with the contained nerves to the soft palate and tonsil ; and some offsets are furnished to the lining membrane of the nose. In the roof of the mouth the mucous membrane, glands, and gums, receive their vessels from this artery. 2. The nasal or spheno-palatine artery enters the nose through nasal the spheno-palatine foramen, and divides into branches : — Some esf of these are distributed on the spongy bones and the outer wall of the nasal fossa, and supply offsets to the membrane lining the pos- terior ethmoidal cells. One long branch, artery of the septum (art. one to naso-palatina), runs on the partition between the nasal fossge to the nasi^^"^ anterior palatine canal, through which it anastomoses with the superior palatine in the roof of the mouth. This branch accom- panies the naso-palatine nerve, and covers the septum with nu- merous ramifications. 3. The pterygo-palatine is a very small branch which, passing pterygo- backwards through the canal of the same name, is distributed to branchf the Eustachian tube and the lining membrane of the pharynx. 4. The vidian or pterygoid branch is contained in the vidian vidian canal with the nerve of the same name, and ends on the upper part ^'^^"^^^ of the Eustachian tube and the pharynx after escaping from its canal. Some other small nasal arteries are furnished to the roof of the other nasal fossa by the anterior and posterior ethmoidal branches of the arteries, ophthalmic (p. 50.) ; and near to the nostril by the facial artery. Veins.— The veins corresponding to the terminal branches Veins; of the internal maxillary artery unite in the spheno-maxil- lary fossa in the alveolar plexus. Into this plexus offsets alveolar are received from the pterygoid plexus and the infraorbital vein ; and from it a large trunk (alveolar, anterior internal maxillary vein) is directed forwards below the malar bone to join the facial vein (p. 30.). Beneath the mucous membrane of the nose these vessels have a plexiform arrangement^ which is particularly large over the free margin of the spongy bones.

To render this dissection easier, the student should be provided with a temporal bone, in which the course of the facial nerve and the cavity of the tympanum are displayed. Dissec. Dissection, — The examination of the nerve is to be beffun tion of . " nerve in at the stylo-mastoid foramen, and to be traced inwards from bone, that point. With this view, the side of the skull should be sawn through between the meatus externus and the anterior border of the mastoid process, so as to open the posterior part of the aqueduct of Fallopius. The nerve will then be seen entering deeply into the substance of the temporal bone; and it will be readily followed if the dissector cuts away with the bone forceps all the bone projecting above it. In this last step, the cavity of the tympanum will be more or less opened, and the chain of bones in it laid bare. The nerve is now to be traced onwards along the inner side of the tympanum, till it becomes enlarged, and bends suddenly inwards to the meatus auditorius internus. The surround- ing bone is to be removed from the enlargement on the nerve, so as to trace to it the petrosal nerves ; and then the meatus auditorius is to be laid open, to see the facial and auditory nerves in that hollow, of The course of the chorda tympani nerve (branch of the tympa^. facial) across the tympanum will be seen by the removal of the central ear bone, the incus. The nerve may also be traced through the wall of the cavity behind, as well as out of the cavity in front, and The remaining branches of the facial nerve in the bone branch- are vcry minute, and are not to be seen, unless on a fresh piece of the skull which has been softened in acid. The student may therefore omit all the paragraphs marked with an asterisk, till he is able to obtain a part on which a careful examination can be made. Facial The facial nerve enters the internal auditory meatus with "^^^^ the auditory nerve. It is then received into the aqueduct of winds Fallopius at the bottom of the meatus, and is conducted temporal through the temporal bone to the stylo-mastoid foramen and the face (p. 40.). In its serpentine course through the bone, the nerve is first directed outwards to the inner wall of the tympanum: at that spot it suddenly bends backwards, andOTIC GAJ^GLION. 153 is marked hj a gangliform swelling (intumescentia gangli- is mark, formis) to which several nerves are united.

'Arismg chorda about a quarter of an inch from the stylo-mastoid foramen, the ^^^P^"^' nerve is directed forwards to the tympanum through a canal in the posterior boundary, and enters that cavity below the pyramid. In the cavity the nerve is directed forwards, across the handle of the malleus and the membrana tympani, to the Glasserian fissure, or an aperture on the inner side of it, through which it leaves the tympanum. Outside the skull the chorda tympani joins the gus- tatory nerve, and then continues along it to the submaxillary gan- glion and the tongue (p. 98.). The AUDITORY NERVE will be learned with the ear.

Otic ganglion.—At this late period of the dissection, to be there is little to be seen of this ganglion, but the student Tftesif should remember that it is one of the things to be examined in a fresh part. Its situation is on the inner aspect of the inferior maxillary nerve, close to the base of the skull, and it must therefore be arrived at from the inner side.

Above this small branch is another minute nerve (small superficial petrosal nerve), that issues from the skull, and joins the back of the ganglion.

This surface is rough and covered with papillae over the anterior two thirds ; but is smoother at the posterior third, though even here the surface is irregular, in consequence of projecting muciparous Under glauds. The under surface, free only in part, gives attach- ment to the mucous membrane, and to the different lingual muscles that are connected with the hyoid bone and the jaw ; and in front of these muscles is the fold of the mucous Borders, membrane named fraenum linguae. The borders of the tongue are thick and round at the base of the organ, where they are marked by vertical ridges and furrows, but gradually become thinner near the apex. Kj^dsof Papillce,—On the dorsum of the tongue are the following ' kinds of papillae; the conical and filiform, the fungiform, and the caliciform. conical The conical and filiform papillae are the numerous small form, " projections, like the villi on the mucous membrane of the small intestine, that cover the anterior two thirds of the situation dorsum of the tongue. Some of the papillae (conical) are die of wider at their attached than at their free end, and these tongue • are most developed over the central part of the tongue.

Thus smaller papillary eminences spring from the common eleva- tion of limiting membrane ; and each has its separate invest- ment of epithelium, by which the brush-like appearance on the surface is produced. From the plexus of capillary vessels in the interior of the papilla a looped offset is fur- nished to each smaller papillary projection; whilst the en- tering nerve sends offsets to the different subdivisions of the papilla, whose mode of ending in each is unknown, though Professor Kolliker thinks he has seen it in the form of a loop, like that of the vessels. Structure. — The tongue consists of two symmetrical ^^ns halves, and separating them is a fibrous structure in the tongue, middle line. Each half is made up of a mass of muscular fibre with interspersed fat; and entering it are the lingual vessels and nerves. The whole tongue is enveloped by the mucous membrane, and a special fibrous membrane attaches it to the hyoid bone.

At the front of the tongue the genio-hyo-glossus will be afterwards followed out. and Outside this triangular muscle in the middle line, is the lingua- longitudinal bundle of the inferior lingualis, which may be ^ * cleaned on the left side, though it will subsequently be better seen on the right half.

The hyo-glossal membrane is a thin, but strong fibrous mem-^ lamina, that attaches the root of the tongue to the upper border of the body of the hyoid bone. On its under or an- terior surface some of the hinder fibres of the genio-hyo- glossi are collected, as if this was their aponeurosis to attach them to the os hyoides. Sub- c.

Only the lingual endings of these are now to be noticed, for the origin from the bones around have been before made out. Dissection,—After the tongue has been firmly fastened on Dissec- its left side, the extrinsic muscles may be dissected on the right half. Three of these muscles, viz., palato, stylo, and palato- ] hyo-glossus, come together to the side of the tongue, at the stj^io- junction of the middle and posterior third; and, to follow ^^°^^"®* their radiating fibres forwards, it will be necessary to remove the mucous membrane from the dorsum and the under sur- face, between the tip and the point at which they come in contact with the border. On the dorsum of the tongue a thin muscular stratum, that is superficial to these fibres, is to be taken away with the mucous membrane ; and beneath the tip, a junction between the stylo-glossus muscles of opposite sides is to be traced. Only the two parts of the hyo-glossus (basio and cerato- of hyo- glossus, p. 101.), that arise from the body and great wing of the hyoid bone, are referred to above. To lay bare its third part, or the chondro-glossus, the other two portions of the muscle must be cut through with the lingual vessels, and raised and shown entering the tongue. The origin of this small muscular slip, two to three lines in width, can now be seen close to the small cornu of the os hyoides, but it is con- cealed farther by some fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus that ascend to the upper constrictor ; and its radiation, near the upper surface of the tongue, will be prepared by taking the mucous membrane, and the thin underlying muscular stra- tum, from the remaining third of the dorsum.

The LARYNX is the upper dilated part of the air tube, in outiitie which the voice is produced. This organ of the voice is rynx" constructed of several cartilages, which are united together by ligamentous bands ; of muscles for the movement of the cartilages; and of vessels and nerves. The whole is lined by mucous membrane* Dissection.—The tongue may be now removed from the Dissec- larynx by cutting through its root, but this is to be done without injuring the epiglottis.

It is pyramidal in form. Its base is turned up- wards, and is attached to the hyoid bone, and to it the epi- glottis is connected; whilst its apex is directed downwards, and is continuous with the trachea. The front is prominent along the middle line of the neck; and the posterior surface move^^ is covered by the mucous membrane of the pharynx. The able. larynx is very moveable, and during deglutition is elevated and depressed by the different extrinsic muscles that are connected with it and the hyoid bone. Six spe- Muscles. — The special muscles of the larynx pass from cialmus- t/^ii . .i ciesof one cartilage to another, and modiiy by their action the larynx. n t i ^ i • state 01 the vocal apparatus. Commonly six muscles are described, but the number is stated differently by anatomists. Three are outside the cartilages, and three are more or less concealed by the thyroid cartilage; most of them are in pairs, and alike on the two sides of the body. Directions.—On one side of the larynx, say the right, the muscles may be dissected, and on the opposite side the nerves and vessels ; and those superficial muscles are to be first learnt, that do not require the cartilages to be cut. Dissec- Dissection. — The larynx should be first extended, and tiou . . . when it has been fastened in that state with pins, the dis- sector may clear away from the os hyoides and the thyroid cartilage the following extrinsic muscles that are inserted into tliem, viz. the constrictor, sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, of the and thyro-hyoid. In front, between the thyroid and cricoid set of cartilages, one of the three small external muscles, — crico- * thyroid, will be seen. The other two external muscles are situate at the posterior aspect of the larynx: to denude them it will be necessary to turn over the larynx, and to remove the mucous membrane covering it. On the back of the cricoid cartilage the dissector will find the crico-arytasnoi- deus posticus muscle ; and above it, on the posterior part of the arytaenoid cartilages, the arytsenoid muscle will appear, crico- The €Rico-thyroideus muscle is triangular in form, and deus°^" is separated by an interval from the one of the opposite side.

The ARYTuENOiDEUS is a single muscle in the middle line, Arytje- and is placed in the concavity on the posterior aspect of the ^ ^" ' arytaenoid cartilages. Two sets of fibres with different directions, viz. superficial and deep, are present in the muscle. The deep fibres are transverse; they are inserted into the deep outer border and the posterior surface of the cartilages, and vers?"^" close the interval between the cartilages. The superficial fibres consist of two oblique fasciculi, which cross like the o^uqu? parts of the letter X, each passing from the base of one cartilage to the apex of the other. A few of the oblique fibres of the muscle are usually continued round the carti- lage to join the thyro-arytaenoid muscle, or to blend with the fibres in the arytaeno-epiglottidean fold of mucous mem- brane. Dissection, — To bring into view the remaining muscles, russec- which are somewhat concealed by the thyroid cartilage, it internal will be necessary to remove the right half of the thyroid, "^"^^ by cutting through it near the middle line, after its small cornu has been detached from the cricoid cartilage.

Its fibres arise, posteriorly, from the front and upper part of the arytsenoid cartilage, some being continuous with the oblique fibres of the arytsenoid muscle; and a fasciculus (thyro-epiglottideus) is attached, anteriorly, to the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage. From this origin the fibres turn upwards with very different directions, and are inserted into the border of tion'^' epiglottis. The strength of this muscle varies much in different bodies. Some of the lower fibres of this muscle, that cover the top of the laryngeal pouch, have been described by Mr. Hilton* as a separate muscle, and named compressor sacculi laryngis.

SO arranged as to enclose a space, and defend the parts more immediately concerned in the production of the voice, viz. the vocal cords, the glottis, and the ventricle of the larynx and its pouch. * See No. 5. of Guy's Hospital Reports.INTERIOR OF THE LARYNX. 167 M 4 Dissection.—For the purpose of displaying the vocal ap- pissec- paratus, let the tube of the larynx be divided along the expose posterior part; and in cutting through the arytaenoid mus- cle, let the incision be rather to the right of the middle line, so as to avoid the nerves that enter it. On looking into the larynx a hollow (ventricle) will be seen on each side; and if a probe be passed into the hollow or ventricle it may be made to enter a small pouch by an aperture in the anterior and upper part. The dissector should fill the pouch on the right side by introducing very small and round bits of cotton wool into it. Bounding the ventricle above and below are the bands of the vocal cords. The laryngeal space reaches from the aperture behind space the epiglottis to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, mied^^ At the upper part, the space that corresponds to the large interval between the alas of the thyroid cartilage is much diminished in size by the thyro-arytaenoid muscles and the produc- vocal cords, and only a narrow interval, the glottis, is left us! at one spot. At the lower part, however, the space remains The rest of the same shape and size as the cricoid cartilage, and is therefore circular, and larger than the narrow part before alluded to. The upper orifice of the larynx will be seen by placing upper in contact the surfaces of the cut along the posterior part. It is triangular in shape, with the base in front and the apex shape, behind, and its sides are sloped obliquely downwards in the antero-posterior direction. Its boundaries are, — the epi- and glottis in front, the arytaenoid muscle and cartilages behind, ^I'es"'^^" and the arytaeno-epiglottidean fold of mucous membrane on each side. This aperture is closed by the epiglottis during deglutition. The glottis, or rima glottidis, is the interval between the Glottis, lower vocal cords; it is placed on a level with the base of position, the arytaenoid cartilages, and is the narrowest part of the laryngeal cavity. In the state of rest it is a narrow fissure enlarged a little and rounded behind, but when dilated it is triangular in form, like the upper orifice, though its wider form, part is turned backwards to the arytaenoid muscle.

The size of the interval differs in the two sexes: In the male it measures from before back nearly an inch (less a line), and across at the base when dilated, about a third of the other measurement. In the female the dimen- sions will be less by two or three lines. Changes Alterations in the size and form affect the interval where ^ ' it is bounded by the cartilages, as well as where it is limited in two ]jj the ligament. In the former part, the changes are occasioned mostly by the rotation of the arytaenoid carti- lages around their axis ; but in the latter they are due to the lengthening or shortening of the bands, or to their Action yielding, as in the passage of an instrument. In the living muscles, body the muscles are constantly producing alterations in the fissure, some acting more immediately on the cartilages so as to be dilators or contractors of its base ; and others acting on the ligaments, and thereby elongating and shortening on base, the sides.

Its cavity com- municates with the front of the ventricle by a narrow aperture, provided mostly with two folds of mucous mem- sur- brane. On the outer surface are numerous small glands, ing " whose ducts are transmitted through the coats of the sac to the inside. Numerous nerves are distributed over the sac.VOCAL CORDS OF THE LARYNX. 169 Its upper part is covered by the muscular slip before referred to (p. 166.). Dissection. — The mucous membrane should be removed pissec- on the right side from the two whitish bands of the vocal cords (thyro-arytaenoid ligaments), that bound the ventricle of the larynx above and below. Then the lateral crico- arytasnoid muscle, and any fibres that may remain of the thyro-arytaenoideus should be taken away. The ihyro-arytcenoid ligaments^ or the vocal cords, are Thyro- two bands on each side, which are extended from the angle nmdT of the thyroid to the arytaenoid cartilage,—one forming the ilfents. upper, the other the lower margin of the ventricle; they are about seven lines long in man, and two less in the woman. a. The inferior ligament (chorda vocalis) is a band of fine infen-ior elastic tissue, which is almost transverse in direction. At- cord tached in front to the angle of the thyroid cartilage, about half way down below the notch, the fibres of the ligament are directed backwards parallel to one another, and are in- serted into the anterior prominence at the base of the arytae- noid cartilage. Internally this band is covered only by thin has these mucous membrane, and projects towards its fellow into the tions. cavity of the larynx, the interval between it and the opposite one being the glottis; externally it is connected with the thyro-aryt£enoid muscle ; and inferiorly it is continuous with the crico-thyroid membrane. The edge that bounds the ventricle is straight and well defined, and vibrates to pro- duce sounds. h. The upper ligament (false vocal cord) is semilunar upper in form, and is much weaker than the preceding one. It is ^^s^™*^"^ fixed in front to the angle of the thyroid cartilage, near the attachment of the epiglottis; and behind to the rough outer surface of the arytaenoid cartilage. This ligament con- is a very tains chiefly fibrous tissue in its interior, which is con- band! tinuous with that in the arytseno-epiglottidean fold of mucous membrane. The mucous membrane of the larynx is derived from that Mucous investing the pharynx, and is prolonged to the lungs through brine, the trachea. When entering the larynx it is stretched be- tween the epiglottis and the tip of the arytaenoid cartilage, forming the arytaeno-epiglottidean fold on each side of theDISSECTION OF THE LARYNX. 176 laryngeal orifice: in this spot it is very loose, and the sub- mucous tissue abundant. In the larynx the membrane closely lines the cavity, sinks into the ventricle, and is prolonged into the laryngeal pouch. On the thyro-arytsenoid ligaments it is very thin and adherent, allowing these to be visible through it. Epithe-^ columnar ciliated epithelium covers all the surface Jium ^ below the superior vocal cords, and is continued anteriorly fe?ent^' in the adult to the root of the epiglottis (KoUiker). In the nature, part of the larynx above the line mentioned, the epithelium is of the laminar kind. Glands. Numerous muciparous glands are connected with the mu- cous membrane of the larynx ; and the orifices will be seen on the surface, especially at the posterior aspect of the epi- glottis. In the edge of the arytaeno-epiglottidean fold there is a little swelling occasioned by a mass of subjacent glands (arytsenoid), and a small fibro-cartilaginous body. None exist over the vocal cords. Dissec Dissection, — The course of the laryngeal nerves in the nerves.; ncck has been already traced, and their termination in the larynx may be dissected on the untouched side. For this purpose the other half of the thyroid is to be disarticulated from the cricoid cartilage ; and care should be taken of the recurrent nerve, which lies near the junction between the two. The trachea and larynx should next be fastened down with pins, and after the thyroid has been drawn away from the cricoid cartilage, the inferior laryngeal nerve can be traced over the side of the latter cartilage to the muscles of the larynx, and the mucous membrane of the pharynx. After- wards the superior laryngeal is to be followed to the mucous membrane of the interior of the larynx, and to that of the pharynx. Two communications are to be found between these nerves ; one is beneath the thyroid cartilage, the other in the mucous membrane of the pharynx. An artery accom- panies each nerve, and is to be dissected at the same time. Nerves Nerves. — The ncrvcs that supply branches to the larynx, vagus?^" are the superior and inferior laryngeal branches of the pneumo-gastric nerve (p. 117.); the former is distributed to the mucous membrane, and the latter to the muscles.

Beneath the thyroid cartilage this nerve is joined by a long offset of the upper laryngeal nerve. h. The superior laryngeal nerve pierces the thyro-hyoid liga- ment, and gives offsets to the mucous membrane covering the geai nervG back of the larynx; it furnishes also a long branch, beneath the ala of the thyroid cartilage, to communicate with the recurrent j.°ij^^s^J^^- nerve. The trunk of the nerve then terminates in many branches for the supply of the mucous membrane: — Some of these ascend in ends the arytaeno-epiglottidean fold of that membrane to the epiglottis, cous and the root of the tongue. The others, which are the largest, brane. descend on the inner side of the ventricular pouch, and supply the lining membrane of the larynx as low as the vocal cords. One nerve of this set pierces the arytaenoid muscle, and appears (?) to supply it. Vessels. — The arteries of the interior of the larynx are Arteries furnished from the superior and inferior thyroid branches (p. 84, 75.). a. The laryngeal branch of the superior thyroid artery enters from su- the larynx with the superior laryngeal nerve, and divides like it thyroid; into ascending and descending branches; some of these enter the muscles, but the rest supply the mucous membrane of the epi- glottis, and that of the root of the tongue and the interior of the larynx. It anastomoses with the following artery both beneath the ala of the thyroid cartilage, and in the mucous membrane of the pharynx. h. The laryngeal branch of the inferior thyroid artery ascends from in- on the back of the cricoid cartilage, and supplies the mucous thyroid membrane of the pharynx and the muscles of the larynx, like the nerve. c. Some other twigs from the inferior thyroid artery perforate two the crico-thyroid membrane, and end in the mucous lining of the interior of the larynx at the lower part. Veins, — The vein that accompanies the branch of artery veins from the superior thyroid, joins the internal jugular or the fefentfy. superior thyroid vein; whilst the vein corresponding to the other artery opens into the plexus connected with the in- ferior thyroid veins (p. 84, 127.).172 DISSECTION OF THE LARYNX.

In addition there are some fibro-cartilaginous sS structures called yellow cartilage, viz. the epiglottis, a capi- f^ges". tulum to each arytaenoid cartilage, and on each side a small173 CARTILAGES OF THE LARYNX. roundish piece (cuneiform) in the arytseno-epiglottidean fold of mucous membrane. The thyroid cartilage is the largest of all: it forms the Thvmid n , ■• -. t 1 cartilage upper part oi the larynx, and protects the vocal apparatus as with a shield. The upper part of this cartilage is consider- is con- ably wider than the lower, and in consequence of this the from, form of the larynx somewhat resembles a funnel. The an- terior part is prominent in the middle line, forming the sub- cutaneous swelline: named pomum Adami; but the cartilage concave , , . , , T . , behind. is concave behind, at the same spot, and gives attachment to the epiglottis and the thyro-arytsenoid muscles and ligaments. The upper border is notched in the centre. The cartilage consists of two square parts or halves, which Formed are united in the middle line. Posteriorly each half of the halves, cartilage has a thick border, which terminates upwards and having downwards in a rounded projection or cornu, both of which ^^^1^. are bent slightly inwards : of the two, the upper cornu is the longest; but the lower cornu is thicker than the other, and articulates with the cricoid cartilage. The inner surface of each half is smooth; but the outer is marked by an oblique line, that extends from a tubercle near the root of the upper cornu, nearly to the middle of the lower border. The cricoid cartilage is stronger though smaller than the Cricoid thyroid ; it is partly concealed by the shield-like cartilage, lage!" below which it is placed, and encircles the cavity of the larynx. It is very unequal in depth before and behind, the Form, posterior part being three times deeper than the anterior, something like a signet ring. The outer surface is rough, and gives attachment to surfaces, muscles. At the back of the cartilage there is a flat and rather square surface, which is marked by a median ridge between two contiguous muscular depressions ; and on each side immediately in front of the square surface, is a slight articular mark, which receives the lower cornu of the thyroid cartilage. The inner surface is smooth, and is covered by mucous membrane. The lower border is almost straight, and is united to the Borders, first ring of the trachea by fibrous membrane.

Each lorm. cartilage is pyramidal in shape, and offers for examination a base and apex, and three surfaces. Base, The base has a slightly hollowed surface posteriorly for articulation with the cricoid cartilage, and is elongated an- teriorly by means of a process which gives attachment to Apex, the vocal cord. The apex is directed backwards and some- what inwards, and is surmounted by the cartilage of San- Three torini. The inner surface is narrow, especially above, and surfaces. . -, . i , . , flat; but the outer is wide and irregular: on this last surface there is a smaller projection that receives the inser- tion of some of the muscles. At the posterior aspect the cartilage is concave and smooth. Two Cartilages of Santorini, — Attached to the apex of each lages'of arytsenoid cartilage is the small, conical fibro-cartilaginous rhii!^" body of Santorini (corniculum-capitulum Santorini), which is bent inwards towards the one of the opposite side.

The lower Foot part is connected by a fibrous band (thyro-epiglottidean liga- ment) to the posterior surface of the thyroid cartilage, near the notch in the upper border. The epiglottis is further connected to the hyoid bone and the root of the tongue, in front of it, by strong bands of elastic and fibrous tissue. After the mucous membrane has been removed from the Glands epiglottis, the fibro-cartilagmous structure will be seen to be perforated by numerous apertures, that lodge muciparous glands.

Ligaments of the Larynx.— The larynx is connected Liga- by ligaments with the hyoid bone above, and with the the la- trachea below. Besides, there are connecting fibres uniting together the cartilages; and between some of the cartilages synovial membranes exist. Union of the larynx with the hyoid bone and the trachea, between — A thin loose elastic membrane (thyro-hyoid) passes from ^ides^^ the thyroid cartilage to the hyoid bone, and a second mem- chea. brane connects the cricoid cartilage with the trachea. The thyro-hyoid ligament is attached on the one part to Thyro- the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and on the other, mem- to the upper border of the hyoid bone, at the posterior aspect. Of some thickness in the centre, it gradually becomes thinner towards the sides, and finally ends in a rounded elastic cord that intervenes between the extremity of the hyoid bone and the upper cornu of the thyroid cartilage. The superior laryngeal nerve and artery perforate this ligament, and a synovial membrane is placed between it and the posterior surface of the hyoid bone. In the elastic lateral part of the ligament will be sometimes found a small ossific nodule (cartilage triticea).

Section XYIII. prevertebral muscles and vertebral vessels. Deep Directions.—On the part of the spinal column that was laid muscles ^ . of spine, asidc after the separation of the pharynx from it, the student is to dissect the deep muscles on the front of the vertebrae. Dissec- Dissection.—To dissect those muscles, it will be necessary tion. , . to remove the connective tissue. The muscles are three m number on each side, and are easily distinguished. The largest one, nearest the middle line, is the longus colli; the muscle external to this, which reaches to the head, is the rectus capitis anticus major; and the small muscle, external to the last and close to the skull, the rectus capitis anticus minor. The smaller rectus muscle is usually injured in cutting through the basilar process of the occipital bone. Longus The LONGUS COLLI MUSCLE is situatc on the bodies of the cervical and upper dorsal vertebr^]e, and is pointed above, Origin but larger below. It consists of two parts—internal and external, the former being vertical, and the latter oblique by two in direction. The internal part arises by fleshy and tendi- pieces. ^^^^ processes from the bodies of the two upper dorsal, and two lower cervical vertebrae; and the external piece takes origin from the upper border of the transverse processes (parapophyses) of four cervical vertebrae (sixth, fifth, fourth, and third).

The inner with it. border is at some distance, inferiorly, from the muscle of the opposite side, but, superiorly, only the pointed ante- rior common ligament of the spine separates the two. The outer border is contiguous to the scalenus, to the vertebral vessels, and to the rectus capitis anticus major muscle. The RECTUS CAPITIS ANTICUS MAJOR is external to the Rectus capitis preceding muscle, and is largest at its upper end. Its major, origin is by pointed tendinous slips from the summits of the ongin. transverse processes (parapophyses) of four cervical vertebras (sixth, fifth, fourth, and third); and the fibres ascend to be inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone, in inser- front of the foramen magnum. The anterior surface of the connec- muscle is covered by the pharynx, and by the carotid artery and the numerous nerves near the base of the skull. This muscle partly conceals the following one. At its in- sertion the rectus is fleshy, and reaches from the middle line to the temporal bone. The RECTUS CAPITIS ANTICUS MINOR is a Small flat muscle. Rectus capitis that arises from the transverse process (parapophysis), and j^inor partly from the body of the atlas ; and ascending is inserted "^^^^^ into the basilar process of the occipital bone, between the ing- foramen magnum and the preceding muscle, and half an inch from its fellow. The anterior primary branch of the suboccipital nerve lies between the borders of this muscle and the rectus capitis lateralis. Dissection. — The small intertransversales will come into Dissec- view when the other muscles have been removed from the front and back of the transverse processes. By tracing to- wards the spine the anterior primary branch of one of the cervical nerves, the muscles will be readily found, for they are placed on the sides of the nerve. After the muscles and nerves have been examined, the tips of the transverse processes may be cut off to lay bare the vertebral artery.

In its course it receives branches from Brancii- the internal and external spinal veins; its other branches are described at p. 74. The vertebral plexus of nerves is derived from the inferior Plexus cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. The plexus surrounds nerves, the artery, and communicates with the spinal nerves as high as the third or fourth. Section XIX. LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRA AND CLAVICLE. Directions* — On the remaining part of the spine, the liga- Direc- ments that connect the cervical vertebras one to another and to the occipital bone are to be examined.

Then remove altogether the muscles, vessels, nerves, and loose connective tissue and fat from the vertebrae. By sawing through the occipital bone, so as to leave only an osseous ring bounding posteriorly the foramen magnum, the ligaments between the atlas and the occipital bone can be more easily cleaned. The COMMON LIGAMENTS attaching together the cervical common vertebras are similar to those unitiner the vertebrae in other ments of /» . . ^ verte- parts of the spine, viz. an anterior and a posterior strong bra. ligament; bands between the laminae and spines; capsular N 3DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 182 ligaments and synovial membranes for the articulating pro- cesses ; and an interarticular ligament between the bodies of the bones. These Directions.—These ligaments are first to be learnt: their hga- ^ o ments preparation and description will be found with the dissection descnb- ^ ^ r where^" ligaments of the spine, at the end of the thorax. But in opening the spinal canal, to see the ligaments inside it, the arches of the three highest vertebrae should for the pre- sent be left untouched. Special SPECIAL LIGAMENTS Unite the first two ccrvical vertebrae liga- ments to each other and to the occipital bone: some of these are external to, and others within the spinal canal, between The ligaments outside the spinal canal are thin fibrous vertebrae mcmbrancs, that connect the bodies and arches of the first cipitai two vertebrae in front and behind, and join the atlas with the occipital bone at the same aspects. Capsular ligaments surround the articular surfaces of all the bones, but these will be examined more conveniently after the spinal canal has been opened. posterior a. Union of the atlas icith the axis.—1.

Between the between occipital bone and the second vertebra are three strong liga- bones, ments — a central one, and two lateral or check ligaments ; and, moreover, the odontoid process of the axis is fixed against the body of the atlas by a strong transverse ligament. Dissection,— Supposing the arches of the cervical Ver- Dissec- ; tebrae to be removed, except from the first three, the arches of these vertebrae are to be sawn through internal to their articular processes. Afterwards the ring of the occipital bone bounding posteriorly the foramen magnum is to be taken away. Lastly, the student should detach the tube of dura mater from the interior of the spinal canal ^ and on raising, from below, the upper part of the posterior common ligament of the bodies of the vertebrae, the central ligamen- tous band between the occipital bone and the axis (occipito- axoid) will come into view. a. Union of the occipital bone with the axis—1. The Between central ligament (occipito-axoidean) is a strong thick band, axis is a which is connected with the posterior ligament of the bodies central . . . band. of the vertebras, and is rather pyramidal in form, with the base uppermost. Above it is attached to the basilar process on the cranial aspect, and near the margin of the foramen magnum, extending as far on each side as the insertion of the check ligaments. From this spot it descends over the odontoid process, and, becoming narrower, is inserted into the body of the axis. Occasionally a bursa is found between the transverse ligament of the atlas and the superficial fibres of this occipito-axoidean ligament which are continued to the second vertebra. Dissection, — After the removal of the occipito-axoidean Dissec- ligament, the following check ligaments will be partly seen, together with the transverse ligament. A band of fibres is to be defined, that passes upwards and downwards from the transverse ligament; but the upper offset may be cut through for the purpose of seeing the check ligaments. 2.

Its surface towards the cord is concealed by the occipito- axoid ligament. This ligament fixes firmly the odontoid process of the second vertebra against the body of the atlas, confining it in a ring, articular When the transverse and check ligaments have been cut ' through, the tip of the odontoid process will be seen to have two cartilaginous surfaces; one in front where it touches the atlas, the other at the opposite aspect, where it is in contact and two with the transverse ligament. Two synovial membranes synovial r» i i • i i • mem- facilitate the movements oi the odontoid process, one being for the joint between the piece of bone and the atlas, and the other for that between it and the transverse ligament. Capsule Union of the articular surfaces, — a. The articular sur- noviai" faccs of the occipital bone and atlas are surrounded by a ?rti-^ capsular ligament of scattered fibres, which is strongest ex- surfaces, ternally and in front. When the joint is opened, the condyle of the occipital bone will be seen to look somewhat outwards, whilst the hollowed surface of the atlas has an opposite direction. A synovial membrane is present on each side. b. The articular surfaces of the first two vertebrae are en- closed on each side by a capsule, which is stronger in front than behind. On opening the joint, the surfaces of the bones may be perceived to be almost horizontal. On each side there is a separate loose synovial membrane.

Dissection. — For the examination of the ligaments in the Dissec- sterno-clavicular articulation, take the piece of the sternum that was laid aside for that purpose ; and should the liga- ments have become dry, they ought first to be moistened for a short time. The several ligaments will appear after the removal of some connective and fibrous tissues. Capsular ligament.—This is a thin membranous expansion, Capsular that incases the articular ends of the bones, and the fibre- ment. cartilage. It is attached near the articular surface of each bone, and is thinner before than behind. Sometimes the stronger fibres, that exist in front and at the back, are de- scribed as separate ligaments. The interclavicular ligament extends above the sternum, inter- between the ends of the clavicles. The fibres do not cross in a straight line, but dip into the hollow between the clavicular bones, and are connected with the upper part of the sternum. The costO'clavicular ligament is a short strong band of and cos;. oblique fibres between the first rib and the clavicle. Infe- cuiarii-" riorly it is fixed to the upper surface of the cartilage of the first rib, and superiorly to a tubercle on the under surface of the clavicle near the sternal end. The subclavius muscle is in front of the ligament. Sometimes the clavicle touches the rib, and is provided with an articular surface and a synovial membrane at that spot. The inter articular Jihro-cartilage will come into view by Fibro- cutting the ligaments before described, and raising the cla- Sge." vicle. It is flat, and almost circular in form, but is thicker at the circumference than the centre. By its upper surface and margin the cartilage is united to the head of the clavicle which is imbedded in it; and by the opposite surface and margin it is connected with the cartilage of the first rib. At its circumference it joins the capsule of the joint. Sometimes there is an aperture in the centre of the cartilage. Two synovial membranes are present in the articulation, one beinff on each side of the fibro-cartilage. The sac in mem- ° , ^ branes. contact with the sternum is looser than that touching the clavicle.186 CHAPTER II. DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Section I. MEaiBRANES AND VESSELS. Position During the examination of the membranes, the vessels, and brain, the nerves, the brain is to be placed upside down, resting in the coil of a cloth which supports it evenly. Three MEMBRANES OF THE Brain.—The covcrings of the brain ^1?^"" (meninges) are three in number, viz. dura mater, pia mater, and arachnoid membrane. The dura mater is a firm, fibrous investment that supports parts of the brain, and serves as an endosteum to the bones. The pia mater is the most internal layer, and is very vascular. And the arachnoid is a thin serous sac, which is situate between the other two. Besides enveloping the brain, these membranes are pro- longed on the cord into the spinal canal, and will be noticed Dura in the dissection of that part. The description of the dura mater will be found at p. 10. Arach- The ARACHNOID is a thin serous membrane, which lines the inner surface of the dura mater and is reflected over the pia mater and the brain. Around the vessels and nerves that intervene between the skull and the brain, the mem- brane forms sheaths, which extend a short distance into the several apertures, and then become continuous with the parietal or cranial portion. Like other serous membranes, it forms a sac which contains a lubricating moisture ; and it consists of a parietal and a visceral part. Parietal The parietal part is inseparably united to the inner sur- face of the dura mater, giving to it a smooth and polished surface, and is continued in the same manner over the pieces of that membrane that project between the different portions of the brain. I noid mem- brane. * The existence of a distinct parietal part to this membrane is denied by Professor Kolliker, Mikroskopische Anatomie, p. 489. (Zweiter Band).187. PIA MATER. The visceral part covers the encephalon looselj, especially Visceral at the under surface, and beneath it there is a considerable not close interval (subarachnoid space). When it is traced over the brain, the following is the disposition of the serous mem- brane. On the upper or convex surface of the cerebrum the membrane passes from one convolution to another, without dipping into the intervening hollows; though it lines the ffreat median fissure as low as the extent of the falx. On hoiiow beneath, the lower or under surface of the cerebral mass the arach- noid covers the anterior lobes, and sinks also into the median fissure ; but farther back there is a space between it and the varies at spots; brain. Still more posteriorly the serous membrane is closely connected to the pons and the under surface of the cere- bellum ; but between the hemispheres of the little brain there is another space beneath it, similar to that at the under part of the cerebrum. The subarachnoid space, or the interval between the it is the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater, is larger in one spot arach- than another, and contains more or less fluid, that has been space, named cerebro-spinal. This space is largest at the under part of the great brain about its middle, and in the fissure between the hemispheres both of the cerebrum and the cere- bellum. If the arachnoid covering is removed from the fissure between the halves of the cerebellum, the aperture of the fourth ventricle will be perceived, by which the cavity in the interior of the brain communicates with the subserous space both of the encephalon and of the spinal cord. The PIA MATER, or the vascular covering of the brain, Pia ma- closely invests the different parts of the cranial mass, and dips into the fissures, as well as into the hollows between the surface convolutions and laminae. Besides covering the sends exterior of the brain, it sends processes into the interior to FntoThe supply vessels to the walls of the enclosed spaces : thus, one penetrates into the cerebrum below the corpus callosum, and is named velum interpositum ; and two vascular fringes project into the fourth ventricle, and are known as the choroid plexuses of that cavity. This membrane is a net-work of vessels, and is constructed it is a r» , 1 . . ^ . n t • • 1 net-work 01 the minute ramifications oi the arteries entering the of biood- substance of the brain, and of the veins issuing from the cerebral substance ; whilst the intervals between the vessels188 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. are closed by connective tissue, so as to form a continuous membrane. From the under surface of the pia mater pro- ceed numerous fine vessels for the nutrition of the brain. Vessels Vessels and nerves. — The arachnoid membrane has but few nerves, vessels, whilst the pia mater is almost entirely composed of vessels and nerves. The arachnoid is considered to be nerveless; but the pia mater is largely supplied by offsets of the sympathetic, that accompany the bloodvessels at the base of the brain (p. 22.). Bochdalek has also described offsets to it from some cranial nerves. Dissec- Dissection.— To follow out the arteries, let the brain re- tion of theves- main upside down, and let the arachnoid membrane be sels. ^ removed from the vessels that are seen on the surface. First, the two arteries that lie in the median fissure of the great brain may be defined; next, the artery that passes outwards transversely between the two lobes of that brain; and, lastly, a vessel that bends backwards along the inner part of the great brain (cerebrum). One artery may be seen ramifying on the upper (in the present position) surface of the little brain, and another is to be followed to the opposite surface. Subdivisions of the encephalon.— Before entering into the detail of the anatomy of the arteries, the chief sub- divisions of the encephalon may be shortly mentioned. Outline The cranial or encephalic mass of the nervous system mass."^^ consists of ccrcbrum or great brain, cerebellum or small brain, and pons and medulla oblongata. Each of these parts has the following situation and subdivisions: — Upper The medulla oblongata, or the upper end of the spinal sphiai cord, lies in the groove between the halves of the small brain, and is divided into two symmetrical parts by a median fissure. To each half some of the cranial nerves are united. Pons The pons Varolii is situate in front of the medulla ob- longata, and is marked along the middle by a groove, which indicates its separation into two halves. In front of it are and its two large processes (crura cerebri) that pass to the great brain; on each side it is united to the small brain by a similar white mass (crus cerebelli) ; and behind it is the enlarged upper part of the cord. Cerebel- The cerebellum, or the small brain, is divided into two lum.189 ARTERIES or THE BRAIN. halves by a median fissure, and each half will be subsequently seen to be subdivided into lobes. The cerebrum, or the large brain, is also divided into two cere- halves by a longitudinal fissure in the middle line. Each half is further subdivided into anterior, middle, and posterior lobes. Between the anterior and the middle lobe is a sul- and its great di cus, — the fissure of Sylvius ; but the limit between the visions, middle and the posterior is indicated by a line corresponding to the anterior part of the small brain. In the centre of the cerebrum, between the hemispheres and in front of the pons, are several small bodies that will be afterwards enu- merated. Arteries of the Brain. — The brain is supplied with Arteries blood by the two vertebral, and the two internal carotid brain, arteries. The vertebral artery is a branch of the subclavian trunk, verte- and enters the spinal canal beneath the membrane between the atlas and the occipital bone. Ascending then to the ends in brain round the side of the medulla oblongata, the artery enters the skull through the foramen magnum, and is blended with its fellow in one trunk (basilar) at the lower border of the pons. As the vessel winds round the upper part of the winds cord, it lies between the roots of the hypoglossal and sub- meduUa. occipital nerves; but it is afterwards internal to the former. Branches. — Between its entrance into the spinal canal Branch- and its termination, each artery furnishes offsets to the spinal cord, to the dura mater, and to the cerebellum. a. The posterior spinal branch is of inconsiderable size, to spinal and arises opposite the posterior part of the medulla: it descends along the side of the cord, behind the nerves, anterior anastomosing with its fellow, and with branches that enter by the intervertebral foramina. b. The anterior spinal branch is as small as the preceding, poste- and springs from the artery opposite the front of the spinal cord. This small branch joins the corresponding twig of the opposite side, and the resulting vessel is continued along the middle of the cord on its anterior aspect. c. The posterior meningeal artery leaves the vertebral of dura trunk opposite the foramen magnum, and ramifies in the dura mater lining the fossae of the occipital bone.190 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Branch d. The inferior cerebellar artery (posterior) is distributed ander^ to the Under surface of the cerebellum. Taking origin from cerebei- the end of the vertebral, or from the basilar artery, this branch winds backwards round the side of the medulla^ be- tween the pneumo-gastric and spinal accessory nerves, and enters the median fissure of the cerebellum. Directed on- wards along the fissure, the artery reaches the upper surface of the small brain, and there anastomoses with the superior cerebellar artery. A branch of this vessel ramifies over the under surface of the cerebellum, and ends externally by anastomosing with the upper cerebellar artery. As the vessel lies by the side of the aperture of the fourth ventricle, it gives a small offset to the choroid plexus of that cavity. Basilar The basilar artery is the vessel resulting from the union Extent vertebral arteries. It reaches from the lower to and upper border of the pons, and ends at the last spot by dividing into two branches (posterior cerebral) for the cere- situa- brum. The vessel touches the basilar process of the occipital bone, from that circumstance receiving its name, and corre- sponds to the median groove of the pons. On each side of, and almost parallel to it is the sixth nerve. Branch- Branches.—Besides the terminal branches, one to each side, mentioned above, the artery supplies transverse offsets to the pons and the under part of the cerebellum, and a large branch to the upper surface of the cerebellum, trans- a. The transverse arteries of the pons are four or six verse to ^ ^ ^ the pons, small twigs, that are named from their direction, and are dis- tributed to the substance of the pons. One of these gives an offset to the internal auditory meatus along the seventh nerve. Resembling most this set of branches is the follow- ferto^ce artery, the inferior cerebellar (anterior): this arises rebeiiar. from the basilar trunk, and is directed outwards to the under surface of the cerebellum, at the anterior part, on which it is distributed. Superior b. The Superior cerebellar artery is derived from the ?arf ^" basilar so near its termination that it is often described as one of the final branches of that vessel.

Some twigs of this vessel enter the piece of the pia mater (velum interpositum), that projects into the posterior part of the cerebrum. c. The posterior cerebral artery takes on each side a Posterior ■* ^ cerebral backward course, similar to that of the preceding artery, but artery; separated from it by the third nerve. The vessel is then inclined to the posterior lobe of the cerebrum, at the inner side, and divides into many branches. Some of these supply the under part of the posterior lobe, whilst others turn up- wards on both the outer and inner aspects of the back of the hemisphere, and anastomose with the other cerebral arteries. Its branches are the following : — [N'umerous small long branches leave it close to its origin, and its offisets enter the base of the brain between the crura cerebri (posterior perforated spot). Soon afterwards the vessel is joined by a small straight branch (posterior communicating) from the internal carotid commu- artery. Lastly, it furnishes a small choroid artery to the fold of and (?ho- pia mater that projects into the cerebrum: this small branch winds round the crus cerebri, and is transmitted between the crus and the hemisphere of the cerebrum to the velum interpositum and the choroid plexus. From the foregoing examination of the offsets of the part of vertebral arteries, and of the trunk (basilar) that continues suppued them onwards, it appears that about half the encephalon — teUaf" viz. the medulla oblongata, the pons, the cerebellum, and the posterior third of the cerebrum—receives its blood through the branches of the subclavian arteries. The INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY terminates in the great internal brain by supplying branches to the remaining two thirds, or to the anterior and middle lobes. Having passed through the space of the cavernous sinus (p. 22.), the vessel emerges on the inner side of the anterior clinoid process, and divides at the inner end of the fissure of Sylvius into anterior ends in cerebral, middle cerebral, and posterior communicating arteJlef. arteries. At the base of the brain the carotid artery lies between the second and third nerves, but nearest the former.

It supplies other branches, thus : — its off- Near its commencement the artery furnishes many small branches to the part of the brain contiguous to the inner end of the fissure of Sylvius (anterior perforated space); and it distributes some branches to the under part of the anterior lobe. Middle 2. The middle cerebral artery is the largest offset of the arter^yf^ internal carotid, and supplies the outer side of the hemi- sphere. Passing outwards in the fissure of Sylvius, the artery divides in it into many large branches that issue at ends in the outcr end of that groove, and spreading over the ex- pan of ternal surface of the hemisphere of the cerebrum, inosculate sphere, with the othcr two cerebral arteries at the front, the back, and the upper part of the brain. Only a few fine offsets require notice: Offsets. A set of small branches arises at the inner end of the fissure of Sylvius, and enters the cerebral substance through the part called substantia perforata antica. Poste- 3.

Choroid 4. The choroid artery (anterior) is small in size, and arises either from the trunk of the carotid, or from the middle cerebral artery. It passes backwards on the outer side of the preceding, and finds its way between the hemi- sphere and the crus cerebri to the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle.

On each side this circle is formed by the vessels trunk of the internal carotid giving forwards the anterior a share cerebral, and backwards the posterior communicating artery. In front it is constructed by the converging anterior cere- bral, and the anterior communicating artery; and behind, by the bifurcation of the basilar trunk into the two poste- rior cerebral arteries. In the area of the circle lie the several parts of the brain that correspond to the floor of the third ventricle. The complete inosculation between the and the cranial vessels, in the circle of Willis, allows at all times a euiation free circulation of blood through the brain, even though a them, large vessel on one side should be obstructed. The VEINS of the brain enter the sinuses of the dura veins of the mater, instead of uniting into trunks that are companions to brain, the arteries. Dissection,—The pia mater and the vessels are now to be J^^^^^^^' stripped from the brain, and the origin of the cranial nerves to be defined. Over the greater part of the cerebrum, the pons, and the medulla, the pia mater can be detached with tolerable facility by using two pairs of forceps; but over the cerebellum the membrane adheres so closely that it will require some care to remove it without tearing the substance of the brain. In clearing out the fissure between the halves care to of the cerebellum on the under surface, the membrane that in re- bounds on each side the opening of the fourth ventricle will pSrmT- probably be taken away. The student should therefore ob- serve now the position and size of that opening between the back of the medulla oblongata and the inferior vermiform process. When the surface has been cleaned, the brain is to be replaced in the spirit till it is hardened. Section II. ORIGIN OF the cranial NERVES. The cranial nerves take origin from the encephalon, with origin one exception (spinal accessory), and pass from it through apertures in the skull. The origin of a nerve is not determined by the place at '^^^^^^^^ which it appears on the surface of the brain, for fibres or real, oDISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 194 roots may be traced deeply into the nervous substance. Each nerve has therefore a superficial or apparent, and a deep or real origin in the encephalon. Respecting the superficial attachment to the brain there cannot be any doubt; but respecting the deep origin there is Real much difiference of opinion, in consequence of the difficulties gray^^ attending any inquiry into this subject. When the roots matter. followed iuto the encephalon, they are found to be con- nected with masses of gray substance, which Stilling has named, in many instances, nerve nuclei.* ciassifi- "j^i^Q cranial nerves may be regarded either as nine or twelve cation , , . . pairs, according to the mode of classifying them. Those anato- asnine mists, who follow Willis and take the smaller number, include in pafrs.^^^^ one nerve all the trunks contained in the same aperture of the skull: as in the case of the eighth nerve, which consists of three trunks in the foramen jugulare. But those who are disposed with Sommerring to enumerate twelve nerves, consider each of the three trunks of the eighth nerve before mentioned, and all other trunks issuing from the encephalon in the like way, to constitute a separate cranial nerve, notwithstanding that it may be combined with others in its foramen of exit. Designa- The nomenclature of the several nerves is three-fold: Thus, the designation may be numerical, as first, second, third, and so forth: number, this mode of naming applies to all and is the one generally used. But a second name has been given to a few nerves from the parts to which they are supplied; as instances of this the terms hypo- name of glossal, pneumo-gastric, may be taken. And a different appellation ormnc- given to others, in consequence of the function conferred on the tion. part to which they are distributed, as the terms auditory and olfac- tory express. In this way two names may be employed, almost in- differently, in referring to a nerve: — one being numerical, the other local or functional, as is exemplified below, oifacto- The rmsT or olfactory nerve (olfactory process) is very ry nerve ^ x / soft and pulpy, being destitute of a neurilemma; and it may be considered an advanced part of the brain, for it has both gray substance and white fibres in its composition, like the cerebrum. The olfactory process is a flat-looking band, wider at each lies on end than in the middle, which is lodged in a sulcus on the lobe, under aspect of the anterior lobe of the cerebrum, and is * The statements of Stilling concerning the deep origin are here adopted, as his inquiries are the most complete, but many will probably require modification.ORIGIN OF THE CRANIAL NERVES. 195 kept in position by the reflection of the arachnoid membrane over it. When the so-called nerve is raised from its sulcus, it may be seen to be prismatic in form, the apex of the prism being directed downwards (in this position). Anteriorly the nervous substance swells into the olfactory forms' hulh^—a mass of gray matter, that rests on the ethmoid bone, bllibf ^'^^ and distributes nerves to the nose. Posteriorly the olfactory process is connected to the cerebrum by three roots of origin, external, internal, and middle. The external or long root is a slender white band, which has . external passes along the outer part ol the anterior perforated space, and across the fissure of Sylvius, and disappears by sinking into the substance of the middle lobe of the cerebrum. The internal or short root is also white and delicate, and internal ' and comes from the inner part of the anterior lobe of the cere- brum. The middle or gray root is connected with a conical ele- middle vation at the posterior part of the sulcus which lodges the nerve. Deep origin.—The external root is said to be connected with Deep the corpus striatum and the anterior commissure, and with the white matter covering the end of the hippocampus major. The inner root joins a band of white fibres connected with a convolution (gyrus fornicatus) to be afterwards examined. And the middle root is continuous with the gray matter of the convolutions. The SECOND or optic nerve is the largest of the cranial optic nerves, except the fifth, and appears as a flat band on the crus cerebri. Anteriorly the nerves of opposite sides are united in a commissure. The part of the nerve posterior to partcaii- the commissure is named optic tract; but the part beyond ^ the commissural union, which is round and firm from being invested by a neurilemmar sheath of dura mater, is called optic nerve. The destination of the nerve is to the eyeball, part. The tract is the flattened part of the nerve, winding round IJf^^J^^* the peduncle of the cerebrum, which is destitute of neuri- ^^^^^^ lemma. In front it ends in the commissure, and behind it splits into two parts at its attachment to the brain. As the tract reaches forwards it crosses the crus cerebri, to which it is attached by its outer or anterior edge; and in front of that peduncle it is placed between the substantia perforata antica on the outside, and the tuber cinereum on the inside, butDISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 196 whether it receives filaments from one or both of those bodies is uncertain. Its com- The commissure (chiasma) of the optic nerves is somewhat missure- \ / x of a square shape, and lies on the olivary eminence of the sphenoid bone, within the circle of Willis. It is placed in front of the tuber cinereum ; and passing beneath it (in this Situa- position of the brain) is the thin lamina cinerea. In the struc- commissure there is a partial crossing of the fibres of the ^"^^* nerves after this manner: — the outer fibres of each tract,. Arrange, few in number, are continued straight to the eyeball of the ment of . t i i n t t fibres, samc Side; but the greater part oi the others decussate, — those of the right nerve being continued to the left, and vice versa, so as to enter the eye of the opposite side. At the front and back of the commissure are some transverse fibres: — the posterior are continued through the optic tracts back to the brain, without entering the eyes ; and the anterior are prolonged to the eyeballs, through the part of the nerve in front of the commissure, but have not any con- nection with the brain. Origin The origin of the nerve will be afterwards seen to come cerS from two of the corpora quadrigemina (nates and testis of one side), and from the optic thalamus and the corpora geni- culata. ongin^ The THIRD NERVE, muscular nerve of the eyeball, is round nerve is and firm, and is attached to the inner surface of the cerebral peduncle, near the locus perforatus, and close in front of the pons Varolii. deep in Deep origin,— The fibres of the nerve pierce the peduncle, cerebri, passing through the locus niger, and enter a mass of gray substance in the floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius.* Origin The FOURTH Or TROCHLEAR NERVE Canuot bc folloWCd of fourth ...T-'i nerve bacKwards, at present, to its origin. It is the smallest of the cerebei- Cranial nerves, and springs from the valve of Vieussens over the fourth ventricle. The nerve appears between the cere- brum and the cerebellum, on the side of the crus cerebri, and is then directed forwards to enter an aperture in the tentorium cerebelli, near the posterior clinoid process. * The origin of this nerve, and of the others as far as the eighth, is tiiken from the following work of Stilling, Untersuchungen iiber den JBau lies Hirnknotens. \197 ORIGIN OF THE CRANIAL NERVES. o 3 Deep origin.— In entering the valve of Vieussens, the nerves and of opposite sides cross. Each then divides into two parts: one (an- aque-^" terior) enters a nucleus of gray matter on the side of the aqueduct of Sylvius; the other (posterior), a nucleus (upper trigeminal) near the top of the fourth ventricle, and in front of the prolonga- tion of the gray matter of the locus cseruleus. The FIFTH or trigeminal nerve is the largest cranial Fifth nerve, and consists of two parts, large and small. This liartwa nerve resembles a spinal nerve in possessing two roots, ganglionic or sensory, and aganglionic or motor, which are blended beyond the ganglion. The nerve is attached to the side of the pons Varolii, origin nearer the upper than the lov^er border. The small or pons, aganglionic root is highest, and is separated from the other by two or three of the transverse fibres of the pons. Both roots pass outwards, through an aperture in the dura mater, above the petrous part of the temporal bone, and are blended in the peculiar manner stated in p. 20. Deep origin.— Both roots penetrate the fibres of the pons, and near are connected with nuclei near the floor of the fourth ventricle. fourth The large root divides into two parts near the mass of gray cfe"*^"' matter called locus cagruleus (p. 240.). One of these bends down- begin- wards to the restiform body. The other, which is smaller, arises SfThe from the locus cagruleus, and from the gray matter near it (upper trigeminal nucleus) which the lower part of the trochlear nerve enters; also from the gray substance in the floor of the fourth ven- tricle, near the hypoglossal nucleus; and from a deeper nucleus, lower trigeminal, opposite the lower border of the pons, within the fibres continued from the lateral tract of the medulla. The small root begins with the fourth nerve in the upper tri- and of geminal nucleus, which is in front of the prolongation upwards s"^^'^- from the locus caeruleus, and anterior to the floor of the fourth ventricle. The sixth nerve, abducent nerve of the eyeball, springs origin from the pyramidal body, close to the pons, and sometimes Serve!^ from the lower part of the pons. Deep origin.— The fibres of the nerve bend backwards, through from the medulla oblongata, to a nucleus in the floor of the fourth ven- ien'tru tricle, whose position is on the outer part of the fasciculus teres, and on a level with the anterior fossa. See Anatomy of Fourth Ventricle (p. 241.). The seventh cranial nerve (Willis) appears at the seventhDISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 198 has two; lowest border of the pons, near the restiform body. It con- sists of two distinct trunks, facial and auditory ; the former being the motor nerve of the face, and the latter the special nerve for the organ of hearing. Origin The facial nerve (portio dura, seventh nerve, Sommer- faciai.' ring) is firm and round, and smaller than the auditory, in- ternal to which it is placed. It issues from the lateral tract of the medulla, close to the pons, and is connected with the lower border of the pons. Small The facial nerve receives a small accessory band of fibres ry piece, that is intermediate between it and the auditory (intermediate portion of Wrisberg); it is then applied to the auditory nerve, and with it enters the internal meatus. Audito- The auditor?/ nerve (portio mollis, eighth nerve, Sommer- ring) has a surface attachment to the floor of the fourth ven- tricle, and to the restiform body. The nerve is very soft, for it obtains its neurilemma, and therewith its consistence, only in the meatus auditorius. Deep Deep origin.— The facial nerve penetrates to the floor of the facfa";° fourth ventricle, and arises from the same nucleus as the sixth of audi- nerve. The auditory nerve has a superficial connection with the white transverse fibres that issue out of the median groove in the floor of the fourth ventricle ; and it is connected deeply with the lower end of the gray mass called locus caeruleus, by means of many fibres that penetrate the upper part of the restiform body, and the lower part of the pons. It is said by some to be joined with the cms cerebelli by a fasciculus of fibres. Stilling notices gray matter in connection with its fibres, as these penetrate the pons Varolii. Eighth The EIGHTH CRANIAL NERVE (Willis) is placed along the has three side of the mcdulla oblongata, and consists of three distinct trunks, glosso-pharyngeal, pneumo-gastric, and spinal acces- sory : the names of the first two indicate their destination, and the last, besides being accessory to the pneumo-gastric, supplies some muscles. Origin of a. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve (ninth nerve, Sommerring) pharyn- is the smallest of the three, and is situate highest. Its apparent origin is by three or more fibrils, which penetrate the lateral tract of the cord close to the facial nerve, vagus, h. The pneumo-gastric or vagus (tenth nerve, Sommer- ring) is connected with the lateral tract of the medulla, below the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, by a series of filaments, whichORIGIN OF THE CRANIAL NERVES. 199 o 4 are collected at first into bundles, but are finally gathered into one flat band. c. The spinal accessory nerve (eleventh nerve, Sommer- spinal ring) consists of two parts — accessory to the vagus, and sory has spinal. parts, The accessory part is of small size, and arises by fine acces- filaments in a line with the roots of the vagus, as low as the first cervical nerve. Finally this fasciculus throws itself into the pneumo-gastric nerve outside the skull. (See p. 118.) The spinal part is firm and round, like the third or the spinal: sixth nerve, but only a small piece of it can be now seen. It arises by a number of fine filaments from the lateral sur- face of the spinal cord near the fissure in this position, as low as the sixth cervical nerve. Along the side of the cord it lies between the ligamentum denticulatum and the pos- terior roots of the spinal nerves, with the upper of which it may be sometimes connected; and it finally enters the skull by the foramen magnum. All three of the nerves converge to a spot below the crus aii con- ver^e in cerebelli, where they rest on a small lobe of the cerebellum theskuu. (flocculus). From that spot they are directed outwards to the foramen jugulare (p. 21.). Deep origin.—The fibrils of the nerves pierce the medulla; and The deep each nerve, except the spinal part of the last, takes origin, accord- ing to Stilling *, from a special nucleus at the back of the medulla oblongata, and near the lower angle of the fourth ventricle. The nucleus of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve and that of the vagus of gios- are in a line, one above another, outside the fasciculus teres. See ryngeai, the Anatomy of the Fourth Ventricle, p. 240. of vagus; The accessory part of the spinal accessory enters a nucleus of two rather below that of the vagus, which corresponds with the posterior ^^^^'^ horn of the gray substance of the cord. The spinal part of the of spinal nerve pierces at intervals the lateral column of the cord, and its sory!" roots are connected with a gray external projection near the base of the anterior cornu of the gray crescent of the cord. The NINTH or hypoglossal nerve of Willis (twelfth Ninth nerve, Sommerring) is placed on the front of the medulla oblongata, and issues by a series of filaments from the sulcus between the pyramidal and olivary bodies, in a line with the anterior roots of the spinal nerves. * Consult his treatise, Ueher den Ban der Medulla ohlonrjain,DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 200 Origin The filaments of origin unite into two bundles, which medulla. Separately pierce the dura mater, and do not become blended together till they are outside the cranial aperture. Deep Deep origin.—The filaments of this nerve are traced to a nucleus from" in the floor of the fourth ventricle, between the groove of the ventri*- Hiiddle line and the nuclei of the glosso-pharyngeal and vagus nerves, which corresponds with the lower part of the fasciculus teres. Section III. MEDULLA OBLONGATA AND PONS VAROLII. The medulla oblongata and the pons are interposed between the spinal cord and the brain proper. In these bodies the elements of the cord are re-arranged and increased in volume before entering the cerebrum and the cerebellum. Uon^^" Directions,— On a single brain the student may ascertain nearly all the anatomy of the parts composing the medulla and the pons ; but if he can procure one hardened specimen of the medulla and the pons united, and another of a vertical section through those same bodies, his knowledge will be much more perfect. Position Position.— The brain is to remain in the position in which pL?^ it was placed during the examination of the nerves and the vessels. Upper The MEDULLA OBLONGATA is the uppor dilated part of the sjJn^ai spinal cord which is contained in the cranium. Its limit is s?ti?a- the lower border of the pons in one direction, and the level of the upper margin of the atlas in the opposite direction, and This part of the cord is pyramidal in form, and measures about one inch and a quarter in length, half an inch in thickness, and three quarters of an inch in breadth at its widest part. Base. The larger part or the base of the medulla joins the pons, the transverse fibres of the latter marking its limit; and the Apex, apex is blended with the cord at the spot before mentioned. Surfaces. The anterior surface is irregularly convex, and is in contact with the hollowed basilar process of the occipital bone. The opposite surface is somewhat excavated superiorly, where it forms the floor of the fourth ventricle, and rests in the fissure between the halves of the cerebellum. On the poste-MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 201 rior aspect there are not any cross fibres of the pons, as in front, to mark the extent of the medulla. The medulla oblongata is divided into halves by a median Division . into fissure in front and behind. The fissures are in a line v^ith Jj^^^vesby those along the cord, and their extent is influenced by the cross fibres before alluded to on the surface; for v\rhilst the anterior one ceases at the pons in a dilated part (foramen caecum), the posterior is prolonged behind the pons, and into the groove in the floor of the fourth ventricle. Each half of the medulla is constituted of the three segments Compo- ^ , . nents of of the spinal cord, which are continued into it; and indi. each half. cations of these are still to be seen on the surface, though the names are altered, and the fibres differently arranged. Thus at the middle line in front is the anterior pyramid corresponding with the anterior column ; at the middle line behind the restiform body, continuous with the posterior column; and between these are the fibres of the lateral tract, with an oval projecting body (corpus olivare) on their exterior. a. The anterior 'pyramid is the most internal eminence. Anterior and receives its name from its form and position. Situate on fs^^nSt^ the side of the median fissure, it is internal to the olivary body, from which it is separated by a slight groove. In- feriorly the pyramid is continuous with the anterior column of the cord, and internally it is connected with some decus- satino; fibres from the opposite side across the anterior and is ° joined median fissure (decussation of the pyramids). Enlarging j^^^J"^^" as it ascends, this body enters the pons, but, before disap- fibres, pearing beneath the transverse fibres, it is somewhat con- stricted and rounded. h. Lateral tract and olivary body,— The lateral tract . , iJ a tract (funiculus lateralis), continuous with the part of the cord between the attachment of the roots of the nerves (lateral column), fills the interval between the anterior pyramid and the restiform body ; but its width at the surface is not the same throughout. Opposite the lower part of the medulla oblongata, it is equal in size to each of the other constituent varies in bodies before and behind it; but near the pons its width is diminished, so that it occupies on the surface only the hollow between the outer side of the corpus olivare, and the restiform body. Its direction also is not vertical, for it is not straight.DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 202 inclined backwards above, as if it was puslied out of the straight line by the projecting olivary body. Sdy^'^^ The olivary body (corpus olivare) is the oval projection close to the anterior pyramid. A shallow groove separates it from the pyramid, and a deeper and wider one is between •does not it and the restiform body. This eminence is shorter than pons, the pyramid, and does not reach to the pons: its upper end Some is most prominent, and arching round the lower end or some- arched , ^ ^ , / 1 • ^bres. times over the surface, are some white fibres (fibrae arci- formes). Resti- c. Restiform body posterior pyramid.—ThQ restiform ijody is body (restis, a rope) forms the largest prominence on the half the larg- mcdulla oblongata, and cannot be seen satisfactorily except on a distinct preparation. This body is posterior to the lateral tract, and projects laterally, so as to give the greater width to the upper part of the medulla oblongata. ^J^^^^at The restiform swelling is continuous inferiorly with the consists, posterior column of the spinal cord; and superiorly it appears to be continued into the pons, like the other seg- ments of the medulla oblongata, but the disposition of its fibres at this spot will be subsequently referred to. Below the level of the olivary body it is divided into two parts by a distinct groove on the surface; one of these, the smaller and posterior of the two, is the funiculus gracilis, or the posterior pyramid; and the anterior and larger part has been named funiculus cuneatus (Burdacli). Between the resti- form bodies is the space of the fourth ventricle at the back Poste- of the medulla. The posterior pyramid (funic, gracilis) is a ramuHs continuation of that part of the spinal cord which is close posterior to tho postcrior median fissure. By drawing forwards the fissure, medulla, or using a separate piece of hardened medulla, the pyramid will be seen to be slightly enlarged (clava) at the apex of the fourth ventricle, where the restiform bodies diverge, and then to become gradually indistinct on the surface of the corpus restiforme. Obex. Where the posterior pyramidal bodies separate they are con- nected by an intervening band or cross piece (obex, Kiegel of the Germans), that closes behind the point of the fourth ventricle- A little higher on each side is a thin lamina of nervous substance Taenia (tsBnia, ligula), which is about a line in width, and forms part of iniSr^' the roof of the fourth ventricle; this membranous piece is at-203 MEDULLA OBLONGATA. tached by one edge to the hinder part of the restiform body, but is free by the other, where it is connected with the vascular fold of the ventricle. Structuke.— The elements of the spinal cord, viz. ante- Fibres of . _ . ^ the me- rior, middle, and posterior columns, are continued into the duiia. lower part of the medulla oblongata, where they can at first be recognised; but they soon become mixed together, and have an arrangement different from that of the cord. Dissection, — In the pyramid two sets of fibres have to be Dissec-; ^^ tion to shown, —one from the same, and one from the opposite side trace of the cord. The fibres from the opposite half of the cord py.ra- will appear in the median fissure, when the pyramids are gently drawn from one another, where they are named the decussating fibres ; and to lay these bare more completely, the small part of the anterior column of the cord on their side, that remains below the cross fibres (for the cord has been cut through near these), may be forcibly detached from its position, and turned outwards. The fibres to the pyramid from the same half of the cord will be demonstrated by evert- ing the anterior column below the decussation, as on the other side. The anterior pyramid receives fibres, inferiorly, from the Fibres of . ' , anterior anterior column of the cord of its own side, and, internally, pyramid, from the lateral column of the opposite half of the cord. The inner set of fibres are deep at their origin, but they Deriva- become superficial in the median fissure, and are then di- rected upwards, close to that fissure, so as to push outwards the inferior fibres continued from the anterior column; and as the inner fibres of each pyramid are derived from the lateral column of the opposite side, they cross each other in the anterior median fissure of the spinal cord: — thus they form the decussation of the pyramids. The pyramid is continued into both the cerebrum and and dis- cerebellum. Its fibres are white and longitudinal, and are tion. collected into a bundle of a prismatic form. Superiorly most of the fibres enter the pons, to reach the cerebrum, but two offsets proceed from the outer side. One is very small and superficial, and is directed below the corpus olivare to the restiform body and the cerebellum; the other invests the olivary body so as to be thickest on the sides, and receiving204 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. a band from it, enters the pons as the olivary fasciculus, or the fillet. oji^vary The oUvavy body, and its Jillet.—When the olivary body has been sliced obliquely, it will be seen to consist of a wavy yellowish line, surrounding a centre or nucleus of whitish naatter; and this toothed appearance has been named corpus is an in- dontatum.

Lateral The lateral tract of the medulla is continuous inferiorly fibres of ^-^j^ ^j^^ portiou of the spinal cord between the anterior and posterior roots of the nerves, and is prolonged superiorly in greater part to the cerebrum, but it gives an offset to the cerebellum. Soon after entering the medulla oblongata, it is divided into three sets of fibres, external, internal, and middle.

Arched or commissural fibres of the medulla.— In each Commis- sural half of the medulla oblongata are fibres directed almost hori- fibres, zontally from behind forwards, both on its exterior, and through its substance. And in the middle line the same system of fibres forms a septum or raphe between the oppo- site halves. The transverse fibres, both the outer and inner, seem to be origin, derived from the restiform body and the crus cerebelli:— the ex^ Arrange ternal set more or less marked in different bodies cross, on the front "^^"^ outer set of the medulla, the olivary and pyramidal bodies, and some may be seen entering the median fissure; below the olivary body they often form a band, the fibrce arciformes of Rolando. At the back of the medulla some may be seen issuing from the median fissure, and crossing that part, to enter the auditory nerve and the crus cere- belli. The internal set can be seen only on sections of the hardened and in- and prepared medulla: they penetrate all the fibres of the medulla, ^^** except the anterior pyramid, and end at the middle line; in their course they perforate the gray capsule of the olivary body as well as its contiguous deposit, and are said by Stilling to constitute the white substance of the former. The septum consists of both antero-posterior and transverse fibres, septal The antero-posterior reach from the one median fissure to the other, and^ consist of two strata, one casing each half of the medulla. These fibres are continuous with the external set, but some of the inner transverse seem to be added to them.

Gray Gray matter of medulla oblongata, — In the medulla 'ob- matter, j^j^gg^^g^ there is the continuation of the gray matter in the two interior of the spinal cord, and there are also some special deposits. Cross sections would be required to see com- pletely its arrangement. In the lower part of the medulla the gray substance has the same arrangement as lower down in the cord, viz. a central trans- cord verse part with a crescentic piece on each side, but it gradually loses that regular arrangement above, and becomes blended with the white substance. Thus the part corresponding to the central or transverse commissure of the cord is laid bare behind, in the fourth ventricle, in consequence of the restiform bodies being re- moved from the middle line ; there it forms a stratum for the floor of that space and is continued chiefly amongst the fibres of the lateral tracts. The crescentic half of the gray matter of the cord, more especially its hinder part, comes to occupy the restiform body, and then to be continued upwards amongst the fibres. In the restiform body it reaches the surface as a gray streak (gray tubercle of Eolando). Special The special deposits are at the fore and hinder parts : — Those sks°" behind are chiefly nerve nuclei, and will be noticed with the fourth behind, yentricle (p. 240.) ; those in front are in connection with the an- before. ^^^j^^ pyramids, or with fibres derived from these — Firstly, there is the thin wavy stratum, that forms the corpus dentatum in the olivary body (p. 204.). Next, outside this, and towards its upper and outer end, is another small collection (Olivennebenkern, StiL), which appears as a flattened yellow streak, and has the same struc- ture as the dark stratum of the olivary body. Lastly, Stilling de- scribes one collection in the anterior pyramid, near the olivary body; and another, external to the nucleus by the side of the olivary body, in the fibres that are continued from the pyramid around the olivary body. PONS VAROLII. Pons. The PONS, or annular protuberance (pons Varolii, no- dus encephali), is situate above the medulla oblongata, and position, between the hemispheres of the cerebellum. In its natural position in the skull it fills the hollow in front of the tento- form TiVim cerebelH. It is nearly of a square shape, though it is rather widest from side to side, and measures two inches in surfaces the last direction. The anterior surface is grooved alongPONS VAROLn. 20T the middle line, and is received into the basilar hollow in the base of the skull. By the opposite surface the pons enters, into the fourth ventricle, forming part of the floor of that soace. The upper border is lonojest and most curved, and and -.1-11 111 11 borders*, arches over the cerebral peduncles; and the lower border overlays the prolongations of the medulla oblongata. On each side is the crus cerebelli, whose fibres radiate over the surface. Structure, — In the pons are alternating strata of trans- it is verse and longitudinal fibres: the transverse set arecontinu- by ionBi- ous with the fibres of the crus cerebelli, and are interspersed and ^ with much gray matter: the longitudinal are prolonged verse f from the constituent bodies of the medulla oblongata. Dissection. — The transverse fibres of the pons may be Dissec- tion to divided along the line of the pyramidal body of the left side, expose and turned outwards, so as to denude the longitudinal fibres fibres, of the pyramid. In like manner a second mass of transverse fibres, which lie below those of the pyramid (first longitu- dinal set) may be cut through outside the pyramidal; and the deep fibres of the lateral and posterior columns of the cord (second longitudinal set) will appear. Amongst this last set of longitudinal fibres is the fillet of the corpus olivare, which the dissector should attempt to trace up- wards from that body. The superficial fibres of the pons can be seen on the side that is untouched. The transverse fibres of the annular protuberance are The collected chiefly into two strata — a superficial and deep^ verse which are united in the middle line: they serve as commis- form a sural fibres of the cerebellum, and are derived from the crus or middle peduncle of that body. There are a few other transverse, that will be described with the septum. The superficial set are mostly horizontal, but some from superfi- the lower part of the crus ascend obliquely over the others to reach the upper margin of the pons. The deep layer is thickest, and contains much gray matter a deep between its fibres. The longitudinal fibres consist of three sets, viz. one from Three^ the anterior pyramidal body ; another from the lateral and fonfjtu- posterior columns of the cord; and a third from the corpus fibres, olivare. These are not simply continued through the pons, but are increased in number by the addition of special fibres208 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN.

The fibrcs of the anterior pyramid pass through the pyramid, pous bctwcen tlio two scts of transvcrso fibres, but not as one mass, for they are divided into a number of small bundles in their progress.

The ascending fibres of the lateral and posterior columns posterior of the cord are altogether deeper than the commissural fibres sph!a^ of the pons, and are mixed up with gray matter ; they are ' also more numerous than the preceding set.

Section IV. DISSECTION OF THE CEREBRUM. The cerebrum, or the great brain, is the largest of the parts situa- into which the encephalon is subdivided. It may be said to the cere- fill that part of the cavity of the skull, which is above a cir- cular line on a level with the eyebrows and the occipital protuberance. Taking the general form of the skull, the cerebrum is Form t convex on the upper aspect, and uneven on the lower aspect. It consists of two hemispheres, which are placed side by has two side, and are partly separated by a median or longitudinal ^p^h^res fissure ; but in the middle line the halves are united by joined by median certain interior parts (commissures), as well as by several parts, connecting structures at the under surface. Superiorly the surface of the hemisphere is entire, but inferiorly it is di- vided into lobes. Under Surface, or Base OF THE Cerebrum. — At its under under part the cerebrum is very irregular, in consequence of of ^^e^L its fitting into the inequalities of the base of the skull; and on this aspect the separation into hemispheres is not com- plete, as on the upper surface, for the median fissure exists only at the fore and hinder parts. The following objects are to be recognised at the base of the brain : — On the under surface of each hemisphere, about one third Division from its front, is the fissure of Sylvius, which divides it into hemi- two. Of these the fore part constitutes the anterior lobe; and the hinder large part consists of middle and posterior lobes, but there is not any groove to mark the separation between them, the anterior border of the cerebellum being taken as the limit between the one and the other. In the middle line, in front of the pons, are the two large And white masses of the peduncles of the cerebrum (crura cere- Xng the bri), one belonging to each hemisphere; and between them iTne.'^'^ is a space perforated by vessels, which is named locus per- foratus posticus. Outside the peduncle is the optic tract, and between it and the inner part of the hemisphere is a fissure leading into the lateral ventricle. Proceeding for- wards in the middle line, the student will find two white210 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. bodies like peas, the corpora albicantia; and in front of these a grayish mass, called tuber cinereum. From the tuber cinereum a conical reddish tube, the infundibulum, descends to the pituitary body in the sella Turcica of the sphenoid bone. Anterior to this same mass (tuber cinereum), are the converging optic tracts with their commissure. Beneath the commissure of the optic nerves lies a thin grayish layer (lamina cinerea); and still farther forwards is the anterior part of the great longitudinal fissure between the hemispheres, with the white corpus callosum in the bottom of it. At the inner end of the fissure of Sylvius is another spot, perforated by vessels, and distinguished by the name substantia perforata, or locus perforatus anticus.

The several parts of the base of the brain are now to be noticed more in detail. Three Lobes of the cerebrum. — There are three lobes in each lach hemisphere, but this division into parts is confined to the sphere; uudcr surfacc. The anterior lobe is triangular in form, and anterior, the apex is tumcd backwards; it is somewhat excavated on the surface now seen, which, in the natural position of the brain, rests on the orbital plate of the frontal bone. The middle, olfactory nerve lies near the inner margin. The middlelohe is the most prominent of the three, and projected, before the brain was removed, into the middle fossa of the base of the skull. The fissure of Sylvius intervenes between it and the poste- anterior lobe. The posterior lobe has no fissure to separate it from the middle one ; its extent forwards is determined, as before said, by the anterior or outer margin of the cere- bellum. This lobe would not be in contact with the base of211 BASE OF THE CEREBRUM. P 2 the skull, supposing it in position, but would be supported on the tentorium cerebelli. The fissure of Sylvius is directed outwards between the anterior and middle lobes, and branches externally into two vius parts, one of which passes before, and the other behind some small convolutions, to which the term island of Reil has been applied. At the inner extremity of the fissure is a narrowed point, corresponding to a subjacent band of white fibres (fasciculus uncinatus) that connects the two lobes.

These convolutions are connected with the large convolution around the fissure. Peduncle of the cerebrum (crus cerebri).—This is a large, Crus^ white, stalk-like body, which reaches from the upper border ^JJ^'* of the pons to the under part of the cerebral hemisphere of under^ the same side near the inner margin. Each is about three hemi- . 1.1 . 11 sphere. quarters of an inch long, and widens as it approaches the cerebrum. Crossing its outer surface is the optic tract; and between the crura of opposite sides is the interpeduncular space, which contains the locus perforatus, the corpora albi- cantia, and the tuber cinereum. Structure. — The peduncle may be said to be formed by a Formed continuation upwards of the longitudinal fibres of the pons, tudinai which enclose here a mass of gray matter between them. Dissection. — For the purpose of demonstrating the struc- Dissec- ture of the crus, say on the left side, the fibres continuous with the anterior pyramid should be cut across in the pons, and should be raised and carried forwards into the crus as far as the optic tract. In this proceeding the mass of gray matter (locus niger) will appear, and beneath it will be seen a second or deeper set of longitudinal fibres. a. The superficial fibres, which form the cranial or free its su. part of the crus, are continued from the anterior pyramidal fibres^^ body. They are longitudinal in direction, and coarse inDISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 212 texture, and are directed upwards radiating to the cerebrum. . The portion of the crus, which is composed of these fibres, is called the fasciculated portion, or the crust, fibres ^* -^^^ deeper fibres are also prolonged to the cerebrum. Thej are derived chiefly from the lateral and posterior tracts or columns of the medulla oblongata, and from the olivary fasciculus (p. 204.). Some of the fibres of the lateral tract of one side cross offsets from the corresponding tract of the sateand ®^ there is a decussation, like that in the pyramids, across the middle line ; and the peduncle consequently con- tains fibres that are continued from both sides of the medulla oblongata.* In addition to the longitudinal fibres derived from the medulla oblongata, are others coming from the cerebellum, which mix with the former: some of these decussate also across the middle line (see p. 238.). The fibres obtained from these sources are situate beneath (as now seen) the gray matter: besides being deeper, they are finer than the superficial set, and are interspersed with gray form teg- matter. The deeper part of the crus, viz. that at the cere- mentura. bral aspect, is constructed by these fibres, and is named tegmentum. The gray c. The gray matter (locus niger) of the crus, is nearer the inner than the outer margin of that body, and is convex towards the free surface, but concave in the opposite direc- tion. Locus The posterior perforated spot (pons Tarini) is situate tus. ' between the peduncles of the cerebrum ; grayish matter is present at this spot, and into it numerous vessels enter. This structure corresponds to part of the floor of the third ventricle. Corpora The corpora albicantia (corp. mamillaria) are two small, tia. white bodies, about the size of peas, which are formed in greater part, as it will afterwards appear, by the crus of the fornix. If one, say the left, is cut across, it will be found to contain gray matter. In front of them is a mass of gray substance ; and behind they are connected together by white brain substance. * This is part of the median commissure of M. Foville, which reaches through the medulla oblongata, pons, and cerebral peduncles. See the work of M. Foville, entitled: Traite complet de VAnatomie, ^c, du Sj/s- teme Nerveux cerehro-spinal, p. 323.BASE OF THE CEREBRUM. 213 p 3 The tuher cinereum, or the mass of gray matter behind Tuber the optic commissure, forms part of the floor of the third reum ventricle, and is continuous with the gray substance in that cavity. In front of it is the optic nerve, and from its centre projects the following: — The infundibulum (funnel) is a and^in- conically-shaped tube, that reaches to the upper part of the buium. posterior lobe of the pituitary body. In the foetus this tube is open between the third ventricle and the pituitary body, but in the adult it is closed inferiorly. It consists of a layer of gray matter, surrounded by the pia mater, and is lined by the membrane of the third ventricle as far as it is pervious. The pituitary body will be very imperfectly seen when it pitui- has been dislodged from its resting-place: therefore it should body, be sometimes examined in the base of the skull, by removing the surrounding bone. Its use is unknown. This body is situate in the hollow in the centre of the situa- sphenoid bone (the sella Turcica), and consists of two lobes, anterior and posterior. The anterior is the largest, and is hollowed out behind, where it receives the posterior lobe. In the adult this mass is firm and solid in texture, and red- dish in colour; but in the foetus it is hollow, and opens into the third ventricle through the infundibulum. This structure is firm and reddish externally, but softer s^ruc- and yellowish internally. In it are large vesicular nucleated bodies, which are embedded in a granular matrix. Dissection. — To see the lamina cinerea and the anterior Digsec- termination of the corpus callosum, the convolutions of the anterior lobe of the cerebrum may be removed on the left side, where they overlie those parts. The convolution (gyrus fornicatus) in contact with the corpus callosum may be divided, and its ends turned forwards and backwards. The lamina cinerea is a thin layer of gray substance, that Gray extends backwards from the anterior termination of the ^^""'"^ corpus callosum to the tuber cinereum. This stratum closes the anterior part of the third ventricle, and is continuous laterally with the anterior perforated spot. In consequence of its great thinness, this structure is often broken through in removing the brain. The corpus callosum is now seen to be bent in front, and corpus then to be extended horizontally backwards in the longi- ^^^^^^""^ tudinal fissure to a spot within a quarter of an inch of the214 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. anterior commissure, where it presents a well-marked con- ends in- cave margin, to which the lamina cinerea is joined. A white feriorly in two band, fillet or peduncle of the corpus callosum, is continued onwards, on each side, from the line of termination before alluded to, to the anterior perforated spot. To the anterior bend of the corpus callosum the term knee (genu) is applied, and to the prolonged central part the appellation beak (ros- and ex- trum) has been given. Laterally the corpus callosum teraiiy ' rcachcs iuto the anterior lobe, and bounds the lateral ven- hemi- triclc in the same direction, so that an incision through it Its con- would open that cavity. In contact with this now denuded volution, gurface of the corpus callosum is the convolution named gyrus fornicatus, which may be seen to begin by a narrow part in front of the anterior perforated spot, substan- Anterior perforated spot (substantia perforata antica) is a forata spaco near the inner end of the fissure of Sylvius, which is antica. ^ ^ situate between the anterior and middle lobes of the cere- brum, and in front of the optic tract. On the inner side it is continuous with the lamina cinerea, and crossing it, from within outwards, is the fillet of the corpus callosum. This space is gray on the surface ; it corresponds with the corpus striatum in the interior of the brain, and is perforated by numerous vessels for that body. Position Position of the part.— Now the base of the cerebrum has to ex- been dissected, the brain should be turned over for the ex- upper amination of the upper part. After the brain has been turned something should be placed beneath the anterior lobes, in order that they may be raised to the same level as the posterior; and a rolled up cloth should encircle the whole, to support the hemispheres.

The cerebral mass is only partly separated into two portions or hemispheres by a median longitudinal fissure ; for the corpus callosum extends from one hemisphere to another, and interrupts the depth of the fissure at the middle part, but before and behind that connecting piece its separation into two halves is complete. haif^' Each hemisphere is smaller in front than behind. Its215 UPPER SURFACE OF THE CEREBRUM. outer surface is convex ; but the inner is flat, and in contact with the opposite hemisphere at the fore part. On the upper aspect the surface of the hemisphere is not cleft by fissures into lobes, but on the under aspect it is separated into two pieces by the large sulcus before seen. The super- j^^^j^^^ ficies of the hemisphere is marked by tortuous eminences, ^JJJ,;^ similar to those of the convoluted small intestine ; the pro- and sulci, jections on it are named convolutions or gyri, and the in- tervening depressions, sulci or anfractuosities. Convolutions.— Of the numerous convolutions the student chief - convolu- may notice the following as the most regular : — one on the tions. corpus callosum; another at the margin of the longitudinal fissure; and some others on the outer surface of the hemi- sphere. The convolution of the Sylvian fissure has been already noticed (p. 211.). Dissection. — The upper part of each hemisphere having pissec- been already cut olF as low as the convolution of the corpus callosum, that convolution is to be cut through on the left side, and its ends turned forwards and backwards ; a white longitudinal band (covered band of Keil) will be seen beneath it. It is supposed that the top of one hemisphere has been kept for the purpose of examining the convolutions. a. The convolution of the corpus callosum (gyrus fornicatus) ex- Convo- tends around the root of the hemisphere, except at the fissure of of corpus Sylvius. It is narrow in front, and begins at the anterior per- forated spot; then courses round the corpus callosum and the crus cerebri, and ends at the posterior part of the same spot. Whilst lying on the inner surface of the hemisphere, it is joined by the convolutions of that part. Beneath this convolution is a band of its fillet fibres — the covered band of Reil, fillet of the corpus callosum, which is connected in front and behind with the anterior perforated spot, and gives offsets to the secondary convolutions in the median longitudinal fissure.

The convolution of the margin of the longitudinal fissure takes Convo- a similar course with the preceding around the hemisphere, but it longitu- lies at the margin of the great median fissure, instead of being fissure, placed deeply in it. Commencing at the anterior perforated spot, where it forms the inner part of the anterior lobe (p. 210.), it is directed back along the margin of the great fissure, and along the under part of the hemisphere to the front of the middle lobe. This is not so distinct as the preceding convolution. c.

The outer white stratum dififers in development in diflferent parts of the brain, and is most marked over the hinder and lower portions of the convolution of the corpus callosum, where it is pierced by minute holes. The inner stratum equals in thickness the other two, and has on its external surface also a thin white lamina, so that white and gray laminae will alternate with one another in the gray matter of the con- volutions. Sulci. The sulci, or the intervals between the convolutions, vary in size in different parts of the brain ; they are deepest generally on the outer aspect of the hemisphere, where they measure about an inch. The There is one of considerable depth on the inner surface of ^here^ the hemisphere, on a level with the corpus callosum, which projects inwards beneath an eminence (hippocampus minor) in the floor of the lateral ventricle. From it another sulcus is directed vertically upwards to the convex part of the hemisphere. s^tion^" Interior of the Cerebrum. — When viewed from the outer surface, the cerebrum appears like a twisted tube, but when a cut has been made into it, it will be found to be solid, with a convoluted crust or exterior.

In the middle, is a large central space, which is subdivided into smaller hollows or ventricles by the before-mentioned con- necting pieces. And the whole, except the foot stalk, is surrounded by a convoluted crust. The fundamental parts of the hemisphere are the crus Funda- cerebri, and two masses of gray substance — corpus striatum bodiet and optic thalamus, which are situate above the crus: the last two bodies are sometimes called ganglia of the brain, because the fibres of the peduncle, whilst passing through them, are increased m number. The connecting pieces, andcom- which are named commissures, pass from the one hemisphere ^res. to the other, across the middle line of the brain, or connect to- gether portions of the same half of the cerebrum: some of the commissural pieces serve as bounding parts of the ven- tricles. In conducting the dissection of the cerebrum, the student will have to learn the form and situation of the several constituent parts, and afterwards to trace the connections between these by means of fibres. Hemisphere above the ventricles, — In the right hemi- Centrum sphere, which has been cut through above the level of the minus convolution of the corpus callosum, the surface displays a henri! white central mass of an oval shape, the centrum ovale minus, that sends projections into the several convolutions.

The white mass in each hemisphere may be further seen to be continuous across the middle line of the brain, where it is connected by a narrowed part, — the corpus callosum.

A part of the ventricular space dips down in the middle lobe of the cerebrum towards the base of the brain ; and to open it, a cut is to be carried outwards through the substance of the left hemisphere, and then downwards, also through the hemisphere, along the course of the hollow. Ventricles of the Brain. — The ventricular spaces in Five the interior of the cerebrum are derived, as before explained, ciesTr'e from the subdivision of the large central space, and are four brain! in number. One extends into both halves of the brain; but commonly the part in each hemisphere is described as a separate ventricle (the lateral), so that these constitute the first and second. Another (third) occupies the middle line of the brain near the under surface ; and another small one (fifth) is included in the partition between the large ven- tricles of the hemispheres. The fourth ventricle is situate between the cerebellum and the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata and pons. The lateral ventricles are two in number, one occupying Lateral each hemisphere; they are incompletely separated in the cie"^^^" middle line by a septum, for they communicate by an aper- ture below that partition. The interior is lined by a thin stratum of nucleated epithelium, with, in some spots, a sub- jacent stratum of connective tissue. Each is a narrow interval, which extends into the anterior, shape posterior, and middle lobes of the corresponding hemisphere. sition° Its central part (body) is almost straight, but the points (cornua) by which it reaches into the different lobes are curved. There are three cornua in each, which have the three following dispositions : — The anterior is directed outwards from its fellow in the other hemisphere. The posterior or the digital cavity is much smaller in size, and is bent inwards in the posterior lobe towards the one of the opposite side. And the inferior cornu, beginning opposite the posterior fold of the corpus callosum, descends in a curved direction in the middle lobe, with the concavity of the bend turned inwards. For the purpose of examining its boundaries, the ventricle consists may be divided into an upper or horizontal, and a lower or partl^ descending part.DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 220 One is The Upper or horizontal part reaches from the anterior zontai.^ into the posterior lobe, and is shaped something like the Italic letter f. Its roof is formed by the corpus callosum. floor. Its floor is irregular in outline, and presents, from before and backwards, the following parts : — first, a small piece of the along it. under part of the corpus callosum; next, a large gray, pear- shaped body, the corpus striatum; behind this, another large white projection, named optic thalamus; and between these two last bodies is a white line, taenia semicircularis. On the surface of the optic thalamus is a vascular fold of the pia mater, known as the plexus choroides, together with the thin white edge of the fornix. Close behind the optic tha- lamus is the beginning of a projection (hippocampus major), that lies in the floor of the descending part of the lateral ventricle; and in the posterior cornu is an elongated emi- inner neuce, the hippocampus minor. The inner boundary of the ary. vcntriclc, or the septum ventriculorum, is a thin partition, which has been named septum lucidum; below the anterior Aper- part of this partition, opposite the front of the optic thala- tween. mus, is the aperture of communication (foramen of Monro) between the two lateral ventricles. The The lower or descending part of the ventricle winds be- fnTpart'; ueath the optic thalamus, and forms a curve like the half- roof j bent fore finger. Forming the roof, will be the optic thala- floor, mus and the contiguous part of the hemisphere. In the floor is a large curved, convex eminence, somewhat indented at the end, which is called the hippocampus major ; and along its concave margin is a thin white band—taenia, that and bo- is prolonged from the fornix. External to the projection of it. the hippocampus is another white eminence, the pes acces- sorius, or eminentia collateralis. In this part of the ven- tricle is the vascular fringe of the plexus choroides: it enters by a fissure internal to the hippocampus. Septum The septum lucidum^ or the thin partition between the ' ventricles, is a translucent part of the cerebral mass, which position, hangs vertically in the middle line between the corpus cal- form, losum and the fornix. It is somewhat triangular in form, with the larger part turned forwards, and the narrow or surfaces, pointed extremity directed backwards. Its surfaces look borders, to the lateral ventricles. The upper border is attached altogether to the under aspect of the corpus callosum; and221 VENTRICLE OF THE SEPTUM. the lower border is joined in part to the fornix, but in front of this body it is connected with the under or prolonged portion (rostrum) of the corpus callosum. The septum struc- consists of two layers, which enclose a space — the fifth ventricle; and each layer is formed of white substance, with an external coating of gray matter. Dissection. — The space of the fifth ventricle will come Dissec- into view by cutting through the part of the corpus callo- sum that remains in the middle line, and by detaching the anterior half from the septum lucidum, so that it can be raised forwards. The ventricle of the septum or the fifth ventricle exists in Fifth ^ ^ ven- the anterior part of the ventricular partition, where the tricie. depth is greatest. Like the septum that contains it, its largest part is in front. In the adult it is a closed space, but in the foetus it opens inferiorly into the third ventricle between the pillars of the fornix. Its surface has an epi- thelial covering like that in the lateral ventricles. Dissection. — The fornix should be next examined. To Dissec- tion. lay bare this body the posterior part of the corpus callosum should be detached with care from it, and thrown back- wards ; and the septum lucidum should also be removed from its upper surface. The fornix, or arch, is a thin white horizontal stratum Fornix; beneath the corpus callosum, which, projecting on each side and^'°" into the lateral ventricle, forms part of the floor of that cavity. It is triangular in shape, with the base turned backwards, and is continuous with the rest of the brain only by its apex and base, where it gives off processes or crura, both before and behind. At its posterior part or base, the fornix has the following Poste- arrangement: — In the middle line it joins the corpus cal- losum, whilst on each side it sends off a small riband-like band—taenia hippocampi, along the concave margin of the hippocampus major. At the anterior part, or apex, it is anterior arched over the foramen of Monro, opposite the front of the optic thalamus, and ends likewise in two processes or crura, which will be afterwards followed to the corpora albicantia and the optic thalami (p. 228.). To the upper surface, along Upper the middle line, the septum lucidum is attached. Each bor- and bor- der is free in the corresponding lateral ventricle, where itDISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 222 rests on the optic thalamus, and along it lies the choroid plexus. Under If the fornix be cut across near its front, the foramen of surface Monro will be opened, and the descending anterior pillars will be seen. When the posterior part is raised, the fornix will be found to be supported on a process of the pia mater, named velum interpositum; and at its base (on the under aspect) between the two offsets, or the taeniae hippocampi, is marked a triangular surface, which is marked by transverse and by lines, g^j^g^jj^gg -j^j longitudinal lines: the surface which is so defined has been called by some (incorrectly) the lyra.

According to this view, each band, commencing in the optic thalamus, passes over the foramen of Monro, and, after forming the body of the fornix, is continued as a distinct piece to the surface of the hippo- campus.

By means of the incision is divided that has been made into the corpus striatum, white fibres parts by can be seen to be directed through it in such a way as to fibres, divide the mass of gray matter into two parts, — one being situate in the ventricle (intraventricular) above the white fibres, and the other outside the ventricular space, below those fibres (extraventricular). a. The intraventricular part (nucleus caudatus) of the one part striate body is pear-shaped, and projects into the floor of the ventrl- ventricle. The end, directed forwards, is large and rounded; whilst the opposite end is thin and pointed, and is continued backwards, outside the optic thalamus, to the roof of the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. Numerous veins cover this part of the corpus striatum. h. The extraventricular part (nucleus lenticularis) will the other be best seen, afterwards, by sections made from the outer thaf ^ side or from below. It is oval in form, but does not reach so far back as the other, and is bounded inferiorly by a white capsule; through it the anterior commissure of the brain passes very obliquely, as a subsequent dissection will show. The tcenia semicircularis is a thin white band of longitu- Taenia dinal fibres, that lies between the corpus striatum and the cX^r optic thalamus. In front this band becomes broad, and joins the pillar of the fornix ; and behind, it is continued, along with the pointed end of the corpus striatum, into the white substance of the roof of the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. Superficial to the anterior part of the ends in tasnia is a yellowish semi-transparent layer (lamina cornea), cornu. and beneath this some veins pass in their course to the veins of Gralen. The optic thalamus is only partly laid bare in this stage optic of the dissection, and its examination may be omitted till '^'^^^'""^ after the third ventricle has been learnt.

Where the pia mater p^^'"' . projects into the lateral ventricle, beneath the edge of the ^^^^^^ fornix, it receives a prolongation from the lining structure of the cavity, and thus the interval through which it enters is closed. Parts in the Middle Line. — The student is now to parts return to the examination of the parts in the centre of the mmie brain, viz. the fold of pia mater and its vessels; the third ^^^'"* ventricle, and the parts connected with it. At the same time the optic thalamus is to be seen. The velum interpositum is the central part of the fold of veium, the pia mater that enters the brain by the great transverse of pia fissure. Triangular in shape, the membrane has the same extent as the body of the fornix, and reaches in front to the foramen of Monro. The upper surface is in contact with is over the fornix, to which it supplies vessels; and the lower sur- ven- face looks to the third ventricle, and covers the pineal body, and a part of each optic thalamus. Along each side is a its late- vascular roll of the membrane (choroid plexus). ^^'^^ The choroid plexus is the red, somewhat round, and frinsred is the n n ' . -I ' n choroid margin of the fold of pia mater m the interior of the brain, piexus of ^ . . the late. Its lower end is larger than the upper, and each is described jai ven- as extending from the foramen of Monro to the extremity of the descending cornu. On its surface the choroid plexus is villous; and the villi are minutely subdivided, and covered by laminated (? ciliated) nucleated epithelium, like that on the surface of the ventricle. Vessels of the velum. — Some small arteries have been ^^^^seis alreadv traced to the velum and the choroid plexus from the veium. Arteries- cerebral and cerebellar arteries (p. 191.). These supply veins; branches to the surrounding cerebral substance. The veins of the choroid plexus receive branches from the ventricle, and end in the following. Along the centre of the velum are two large veins, veins with of Galen, which begin at the foramen of Monro, by the Gaien. union of branches from the corpus striatum and the choroid plexus. Lying side by side, these veins are usually united at the posterior part of the velum into one, which opens into the straight sinus.

In reflecting the piece of pia mater, the student must be careful of the pineal body, which would otherwise be detached.

Its boundaries and communications are given below: — Roof. The roof is formed by the velum interpositum and the Floor, fornix. The floor is very oblique from behind forwards, so that the depth of the cavity is greater in front than behind: corresponding with the floor are the parts at the base of the brain, which lie between the crura cerebri and the anterior longitudinal fissure, viz. locus perforatus, corpora albicantia, tuber cinereum, commissure of the optic nerves, and lamina Parts cinerea. On the sides of the cavity the optic thalami are sides, situate. In front of the space are the descending pillars of in front, fomix, with part of the anterior commissure of the cere- and^be- brum in the interval between them. Behind, are the posterior commissure and the pineal body. Crossing the centre of the space, from one optic thalamus to another, is a band of gray matter — the soft commissure. Opening This spaco communicates with the other ventricles of the other brain in the following way: — In front it joins each lateral ventri- <-» cies. ventricle through the foramen of Monro, and opens into the fifth ventricle in the fetus. Behind is an opening into the fourth ventricle, beneath the posterior commissure, which is named aqueduct of Sylvius. At the lower part, in front, there is a depression opposite the infundibulum (iter ad in- fundibulum). The lining of the ventricle is continued into the neighbouring cavities through the difierent apertures of communication, and closes the iter ad infundibulum. Gray Gray matter of the ventricle.—A stratum of gray matter of the is seen to cover most of the surface of the ventricle. At the lower part of each optic thalamus it envelops the crus of the fornix, and ascends to the septum lucidum j and in the floorANTERIOR COMMISSURE OF THE CEREBRUM. 227 of the cavity it also exists in abundance, entering into the corpora albicantia, and uniting the structures that form the floor of the third ventricle. In the middle of the space it reaches from side to side, and forms most of the soft com- missure. The anterior commissure of the cerebrum is a round Anterior bundle of white fibres, which passes through both corpora sureT'^ striata, and connects the opposite hemispheres. To see it in form and one half of its extent, the student should make the following dissection: — Dissection.—On the side on which the corpus striatum has To see been cut into, the commissure is to be followed into the corpus interior of that body, by scraping away the gray matter (intraventricular) with the handle of the scalpel. The commissure may then be seen to perforate below the white fibres of the corpus striatum, and to pass through the other mass of gray matter (extraventricular) of the same body. Free only in the middle line, where it lies before the Position; pillars of the fornix, the anterior commissure perforates the corpus striatum, and passes in succession through the intra- and ventricular gray mass, the white fibres, and the extraventri- cular gray matter. Lastly, the commissure pierces the white to roo^^ stratum bounding externally the corpus striatum, and ends firior in the roof of the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle. ' The posterior commissure of the cerebrum is smaller than Poste- the anterior, and is placed above the opening into the fourth missure. ventricle. Laterally it enters the substance of the optic thalamus. The thalamus opticus (inferior ganglion of the cerebrum) Thaia. will be best seen on that side on which the inferior cornu of ^ticus. the lateral ventricle has been opened. It is a square-shaped Form body, which forms part of the lateral and third ventricles, liion"!' and is free where it enters into those cavities. The upper surface projects in the floor of the lateral upper ventricle, and is marked in front by a prominence — anterior tubercle, near the taenia semicircularis. The under surface under forms part of the roof of the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle, and into it the crus cerebri is inserted. By the inner side this body enters into the third ventricle; and inner along its upper part, on this aspect, lies the peduncle of the ^' pineal body.

And the posterior part, which is free in the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle, presents inferiorly two small roundish tubercles,—internal and ex- ternal geniculate bodies, with which the optic nerve is con- nected. Origin The origin of the optic nerve from the thalamus, and from nerve!*^ the geniculate and quadrigeminal bodies, can be now seen. At the back of the crus cerebri the optic tract receives fibres from the optic thalamus, which it touches, and then divides into two terminal bands : —one of these is connected with the gray matter in the external geniculate body, and is continued onwards to one of the corpora quadrigemina (nates); the other is similarly connected with the internal geniculate body, and then prolonged to the other quadri- geminal body (testis) of the same side. Dissec- Dissection. — The origin of the fornix in the optic tha- lamus may be next followed out. But the anterior com- missure and the anterior part of the corpus callosum should first be cut along the middle line, so that the left hemisphere can be separated from the other; on this (the left) the crus of the fornix is to be traced downwards to the corpus albicans, and then followed upwards into the optic thalamus.

ICENTRAL BODIES OF THE CEREBRUM. 229 The pineal gland (conarium) is a small conical body, Pineal which is situate above the posterior commissure, and be- position, tween the anterior pair of the corpora quadrigemina. In shape, shape like the cone of a fir, it is less than a quarter of an inch in length, and has the base or wider part turned for- wards. It is connected to the optic thalami by two white bands,—peduncles of the pineal body: these begin at the attach- base of the pineal gland, and extending forwards, one on thl"a-*° each side, along the inner part of the optic thalami, end by joining the crura of the fornix. The base of the gland is further connected by transverse white fibres with the pos- terior commissure. This body is of a red colour and vascular, and encloses a Struc- cavity. It contains in its substance large pale nucleated cells, with a few nerve fibres, and much calcareous material. The corpora quadrigemina are four small bodies, which Corpora are arranged in pairs, right and left, and are separated by a gemlna. median groove. Each pair is situate on the cerebral aspect in pairs of the peduncle of the cerebrum of the same side. sSe.^^^ The anterior eminence (nates) is somewhat larger than Anterior the posterior, from which it is separated by a slight depres- (nates), sion ; it is oblong from before backwards, and sends forwards a white band to join the optic thalamus and the optic nerve.

These bodies are small masses of gray substance enveloped struc- by white, and are placed on the band of the fillet that forms their the roof of the aqueduct of Sylvius. They send processes ^ (brachia) to the optic thalamus, which are accessory parts to the peduncular fibres of the cerebrum. Fillet of the olivary body, — If the upper margin of the Fiiietof cerebellum be pulled aside, a white band, about a quarter of body"^ an inch in width, will be seen to issue from the transverse fibres of the pons, and to be directed upwards to the corpora quadrigemina. This is the upper or commissural piece of P^^^es^^ the fillet (p. 208.), which passes to the corpora quadrigemina, corpora and joins beneath them, over the Sylvian aqueduct, with gemina. the similar part of the opposite side.230 DISSECTION OF THE BKAIN. Three STRUCTURE OF THE Cerebrum.—In eacli Cerebral hemi- fibres in Sphere three principal sets of constituent fibres are recog- brum. nised, viz. diverging, and both transverse and longitudinal: the former are in part continuous with those of the spinal cord, and are supposed to form parts of the cerebrum ; while the two latter join distant bodies, and are considered to be only connecting or commissural in their office. Fibres of A. Peduncular Or diverqinq fibres.—In the crus cerebri crus V ^ y cerebn ; or the root of the cerebral hemisphere, two bundles of longi- sphere ^^^^^^^ fibres are collected; these are separated, in part, by gray matter, and are derived mediately from the spinal cord (p. 211.). From this source the hemisphere may be said to spring. Dissec- Dissection. — A complete systematic view of the diverging them fibres cannot be given now, because the dissection necessary for that purpose would destroy parts that have not yet been seen. At this stage the purpose is to show chiefly the pas- sage of those fibres from the crus through the two cerebral ganglia. in the To tracc the diverging fibres onwards, beyond the crus s°rmtum Cerebri, through the corpus striatum, the nucleus caudatus of that body should be scraped away from above them; and this dissection should be made on the side on which the striate body and the optic thalamus remain uncut. In this proceeding the pecten of Eeil comes into view, viz. gray matter passing between the white fibres, and giving the appearance of the teeth of a comb. \ On taking away completely the prolonged part of the nu- cleus^ others of the same set of fibres will be seen issuing from the outer side of the optic thalamus, and then radiating and op-'' to the posterior and inferior lobes. After tracing those lamus. fibres, a part of the upper surface of the optic thalamus may be taken away at the posterior end to denude an accessory bundle to the peduncular fibres, which comes beneath the corpora quadrigemina from the superior peduncle of the ce- rebellum. Fibres Their arrangement. — The diverging fibres radiate from duncie the peduncle of the cerebrum to the surface of the hemi- divergi gpj^gpQ^ passing in their course through the two cerebral ganglia (optic thalamus and corpus striatum), and they form231 FIBRES OF THE CEREBRUM. a conicallj-shaped mass, whose apex is below and base above. The fibres that form the free or fasciculated part of the in corpus ^, striatum peduncle pass mostly through the middle of the striate body ; ^/J^^^p- whilst those on the opposite aspect of the peduncle, which lamus: form its tegmentum, are transmitted chiefly through the under part of the optic thalamus, though some pass through both corpus striatum and optic thalamus. In those two ganglionic bodies the fibres are greatly increased in number; and in the optic thalamus, they receive accessory bundles their ac- from the superior peduncle of the cerebellum (p. 237.), from bands? the fillet of the olivary body, from the pair of the corpora quadrigemina on the same side, and from the corpora geni- culata. On escaping from the striate body and the thalamus in the^ the fibres radiate into the anterior, middle, and posterior sphere , . they ex- parts of the cerebral hemisphere, forming the corona radiata, tend to In the hemisphere the fibres are continued to the convolu- tions. tions, but before reaching the circumference of the brain they decussate with the converging fibres of the corpus cal- losum. Their expansion in the hemisphere resembles a fan bent down in front and behind, forming thus a layer which is concave on the under side. Their extent.—It must not be supposed that all the fibres Fibres of the peduncle reach the surface of the brain, nor that all reaching those at the circumference are originally derived from the out. peduncle; for some of the fibres of the crus cerebri end in the corpus striatum and the optic thalamus, especially the former; and others extend only from those ganglionic bodies to the surface of the hemisphere. Thus, in addition to the fibres that extend throughout, viz. from the crus to the sur- face, some connect the peduncle of the cerebrum with the ganglia, and others connect the ganglia with the convo- lutions on the exterior. Their source. — The fibres thus entering inferiorly the source cerebrum through its peduncle, and continued thence to the cord.; periphery of the hemisphere, are derived from all three divisions of the medulla oblongata., viz. anterior pyramid, lateral column, and restiform body, and therefore directly from all the divisions of the spinal cord (p. 203.). The decussations between the fibres of opposite sides have been before referred to (p. 204, 212.).232 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. under corpus callo- sum. Com- B. The transverse commissural fibres connect the hemi- trans- sphcrcs of the cerebrum across the middle line. These fibres, fibres give rise to the great commissure or the corpus cal- losum (p. 218.), and to the anterior and posterior com- missures (p. 227.). All these bodies have been already examined.

Other longitudinal parits; fibres may also be enumerated on the upper and under sur- and faces of the corpus callosum, along the middle line; together with the band of the convolution of the corpus callosum: all these last are connected with the anterior perforated spot of the base of the brain. Optic Structure of the optic thalamus, — On making sections of mus the optic thalamus on the side on which it is entire (the left), above tliis body will be found to consist of layers of gray and below, white substance, at the upper and inner parts; and of the medullary fibres (tegmentum) of the peduncle of the cere- brum, at the lower and outer parts. Section Corpus Striatum,—By slicing through the corona radiata striatum ou the right side, so as to bring into view the extraventri- outside. cular part (nucleus lenticularis) of the corpus striatum, the extent and form of that mass, and the situation of the ante- rior commissure, will be apparent.

Lastly the handle of the scalpel should be passed along a sulcus at the circumference of the cerebellum, between the upper and under surfaces. Section Y. the cerebellum. The cerebellum, little brain, is flattened from above down- Form wards, so as to be widest from side to side, and measures about four inches in this last direction. This part of the position of csre- encephalon is situate in the posterior fossae of the base of beiium. the skull, beneath the tentorium cerebelli. Like the cere- Divi- brum, it is incompletely divided into two hemispheres, — the division being marked by a wide groove along the under surface, and by a notch at the posterior part which receives the falx cerebelli. Upper Surface. — On the upper aspect the cerebellum No is raised in the centre, but is sloped towards the circum- onThe ference. There is not any median sulcus on this aspect, sStce; and the halves are united by a central constricted part or halves isthmus, — the superior vermiform process. Separating this median surface from the under one, at the circumference, is the ^^"^^ horizontal fissure, which is wide in front, and extends back- wards from the pons to the middle line of the cerebellum. The surface of the cerebellum is marked by plates or Laminse laminae, instead of convolutions, which are notched on the their sides, and form segments of circles, with their convexity mentf^ directed backwards, and with a concentric arrangement. On the upper aspect the laminae pass from the one hemi- sphere to the other, with only a slight bending forwards of the most anterior in the superior vermiform process ; but on the under aspect they join the sides of the different bodies, or commissures, in the median fissure. Between the laminae suici are are sulci or fissures, which are lined by the pia mater, and or deep reach to different depths: the shallower of these separate the laminEe; but the deeper limit the lobes, and reach down- wards to the white substance of the interior. Here and there the sulci are interrupted by cross laminae.DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 234 A fissure The UNDER SURFACE is convex, being received into the sent fossae of the skull, and is divided into hemispheres by a median hollow (vallecula), which is The central sulcus, or the vallecula, receives the medulla called . . . valley, oblongata, and is wider at the middle than at either the and con- anterior or the posterior part.

Its anterior projection into the fourth ventricle is named nodule, or laminated tubercle; and on its side is a furrowed ridge of gray matter, the furrowed hand, which is notched on the surface and unites it with the almond-like lobe of the hemisphere. Connected with the nodule is a thin white layer velum, on each side, — the medullary velum; but this and the fur- rowed band will be seen in a subsequent dissection (p. 235.). pyramid, Behind the uvula is a tongue-shaped body, named pyramid, which is elongated from side to side, and is marked by and com. trausversc laminae. Still farther back are certain transverse sures. pieces extending between the posterior lobes of the hemi- spheres, of which they were considered by Keil to be the commissures. Seven LoBES OF THE HEMISPHERE. — Each hemisphere is sub- each divided into lobes on both the upper and the under aspect; sphere, and issuing from its anterior part is a large stalk-like process, which is subdivided into three pieces, and connects the cere- thrte l^^llum with othcr parts, viz. an upper offset to the cere- pedun- brum, a middle one to the pons, and an inferior one to the medulla oblongata. Two On the upper surface there are two lobes, anterior and upper°" posterior, which are separated by a sulcus, but the interval surface, jj^^^^ggj^ them is not well marked. The anterior or square235 LOBES OF THE CEREBELLUM. lobe extends back to a level with the posterior edge of the vermiform process ; and the posterior reaches thence to the great horizontal fissure at the circumference. On the under surface of the cerebellum, there are three three on lobes that are separated, as above, by sulci amongst the surface, laminas, but these are not more distinct than on the upper surface : — Beginning behind, the student will meet first the posterior pos- lobe, which joins the commissural laminag behind the pyramid in the vallecula. Next in order is the slender lobe, which is slender, connected with the posterior part of the pyramid, as well as with the other transverse laminse behind that body. And lastly, attached to the side of the pyramid, is the biventral and^w- lobe. Two other lobes appear between the biventral lobe and Two the medulla oblongata: — One of these is the amygdaloid lobes in lobe, which projects into the vallecula opposite the uvula, ^^^yl^ and touches the medulla oblongata. The other is a small ^^'^^^ pyramidal slip, that is directed outwards over (the under surface being uppermost) the crus cerebelli, and is named ^^Jj^^^^- flocculus^ or subpeduncular lobe. Dissection. — To see the flocculus and the posterior me- Dissec- dullary velum, the biventral and slender lobes of the under surface are to be sliced off, on the left side, so that the amyg- daloid lobe may be everted. The flocculus is then bared, and passing from it to the tip of the uvula is the thin white layer of the posterior velum; beneath the last a bit of paper may be inserted. The furrowed band on the side of the uvula can be now fully seen. Flocculus and medullary velum, — The position of the Position flocculus to the crus cerebelli, and in front of the biventral st"ructure lobe^ has been before mentioned. This body resembles the cuiuT' other lobes in structure; and it may be considered a rudi- mentary lobe, for it is divided on the surface into laminae, and contains a white medullary centre, from which offsets are furnished to those divisions. Passing from the flocculus to the tip of the inferior vermi- Poste- ^ form process (nodule) is a thin white layer, the medullary duUary velum (inferior or posterior), which serves as a commissure to the flocculi. On each side this band is semilunar in form. Form its anterior edge is free, but its posterior border is attached236 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 1 tach- in front of the transverse furrowed band. In front of the nodule the pieces of opposite sides are united, and form the membranous velum. Cere- INTERIOR OF THE CEREBELLUM. — In the Cerebellum there soiidhi-^ is not any cavity or ventricle enclosed as in the cerebrum, ternaiiy. interior there is a large white centre, corresponding with that of the cerebrum, which furnishes offsets to the laminae, and to other parts of the encephalon.

This proceeding may be accomplished by placing the scalpel in the horizontal fissure, at the circumference, and then carrying it inwards as far as the upper vermiform process, so as to detach the cortical and cor- stratum.

The superior peduncle (processus ad cerebrum) is superior directed forwards towards the corpora quadrigemina (testis), d^""" It is rather flattened in shape, and forms part of the roof of the fourth ventricle: between the peduncles of opposite sides the valve of Vieussens is situate. Continuous behind with is above the inferior vermiform process, its fibres receive an offset ventri- from the interior of the corpus dentatum, and then pass beneath the band of the fillet, and beneath the pair of the corpora quadrigemina of the same side, to enter the crus cerebri and the optic thalamus. Beneath the corpora quadrigemina the internal fibres of Its fibres this peduncle are directed inwards, through those continued decui from the fasciculus teres, and cross the corresponding fibres of the other side, forming thus a decussation like that of the pyramids * (p. 204.). In this way the fibres of each peduncle end partly in the same, and partly in the opposite hemisphere of the cerebrum. Between the superior peduncles is the thin, translucent, vaive of white layer, — the valve of Vieussens (velum medullare an- sens terius), which forms part of the roof of the fourth ventricle, the two. It is thin and pointed anteriorly, but widens behind, where it is connected with the under part of the vermiform process.

Its fibres are connected chiefly with the laminse of the upper surface of the cerebellum. It will be better seen when the fourth ventricle has been opened. Fibres Course of the fibres,— The fibres issuing in the peduncles pidun- from the cerebellar hemisphere connect this with its fellow, with the cerebrum, and with the spinal cord of the same side. The description already given of the middle peduncle, both here and with the pons, will suffice for its fibres, of upper. The fibres of the upper peduncle are continued into the crus cerebri, and thus form part of the diverging cerebral set of fibres; but before they reach their final destination there is a partial decussation with the fibres of the opposite peduncle, so that some from the right half of the cerebellum are continued to the left half of the cerebrum, and vice versa, and The fibres of the lower peduncle enter the cord, and con- nect the cerebellum with all three portions of the half of the medulla oblongata of the same side; and so, indirectly, with all the corresponding half of the cord, except the small pos- terior median column : for fibres connect it with the anterior pyramid, with the lateral tract or column, and with the resti- form body.

This body measures three fourths of an inch from before back- wards, and is situate near the inner part of the white centre. It consists of a small capsule which, when cut across, appears as a thin, wavy, grayish-yellow line; this bag is open at the anterior part, and encloses a nucleus of whitish matter. Through its anterior aperture issues a band of fibres from the nucleus to join the superior peduncle.

Here the branch- ing appearance of a tree (arbor vitse) is best seen, in con- sequence of the central parts being longer, and the laminae more divided. The FOURTH VENTRICLE (fossa rhomboidalis) is a space Fourth between the cerebellum and the posterior aspect of the cie. medulla oblongata and pons. It has the form of a lozenge, with the points placed upwards and downwards.

Its greatest breadth is at the spot where the pedun- breadth, cular offsets of the cerebellum are connected with the medulla and pons ; and a transverse line in this situation would divide the hollow into two triangular portionsupper and lower. The lower half has been named the calamus scrip- calamus torius, from its resemblance to a writing pen. torius. The lateral boundaries are more marked at the upper than Lateral at the lower part. For about half way down, the cavity is ry. limited on each side by the superior peduncle of the cere- bellum, which projects over it, forming part as well of the roof; and along the lower half lies the eminence of the resti- form body on each side. The roof of the space is somewhat arched, and is formed Roof, above by the valve of Vieussens, and the under part of the vermiform process ; and, towards the lower part, by the thin nervous stratum of the ligula (p. 202.), and by the reflection of the pia mater from the spinal cord to the surface of the vermiform process. The floor of the ventricle corresponds to the posterior Floor, surfaces of the medulla oblongata and pons, and is grayish in colour. Along its centre is a median groove, that ends Parts in below, at the point of the calamus and within the swollen median part of the posterior pyramid, in a minute hole,—the remains240 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. fascicu- of the canal of the cord.

This eminence reaches the whole length of the floor, and is pointed and little marked inferiorly, where it is covered by gray substance ; but it becomes whiter and more pro- minent superiorly, and its widest point is opposite the attach- ment of the crus cerebelli. It is formed by the fibres of the medulla oblongata derived from the lateral tract and the restiform body, which ascend to the cerebrum. The outer border of the eminence is limited externally by a slight groove, which (in some bodies well marked) will point out fovea, the position of two fossae (fovea anterior et posterior). The poste- posterior fossa is below near the beginning of the groove, anterior; and the anterior is opposite the crus cerebelli. At the top of the anterior fossa is a collection of very dark gray sub- stance " which has a bluish appearance as it is seen through locus the thin stratum covering it, and is named locus cceruleus^^ leus; and a bluish streak (tasnia violacea) is continued upwards from it, at the outer edge of the eminentia teres, to the opening in the top of the fourth ventricle. Crossing the floor on each side, opposite the lower border of the pons^ white are some white streaks, that vary much in their arrange- ment, and sometimes are not to be recognised: they issue from the central median fissure, and enter the crus cerebelli and the auditory nerve (p. 205.); but one may oftentimes be seen to enter the locus caeruleus.

The fourth ventricle communicates at the upper part with open- . ings of the third ventricle through the Sylvian aqueduct; and with the ven- the subarachnoid space of the cord and brain, through an aperture in the pia mater of the roof that intervenes between the medulla and the cerebellum : laterally, the ventricular space is extended for a short distance between the cerebellum and the side of the medulla oblongata. The lining of the and its other ventricles is prolonged into this by the aperture of communication with the third. In this ventricle is a vascular fold, or a choroid plexus, on choroid each side, similar to the body of the same name in the other the ca- ventricles. It is attached to the inner surface of the mem- brane (pia mater), that closes the ventricle between the medulla and the cerebellum, and it extends upwards on the side. Its vessels are supplied by the inferior cerebellar artery. Gray matter of fourth ventricle, — The gray matter in Gray connection with the floor of the fourth ventricle exists in the two no in • kinds. lorm 01 masses, and as a suriace-covering.

DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. Section I. THE WALL OF THE THORAX AND THE AXILLA. The parts included in this Section, via. the wall of the Direc-- • 1 • T • • ^^^^ chest and the axilla, are to be learnt withm a fixed time, in the dis- order that the examination of the thorax may be undertaken. Whilst the dissection of the thorax is in progress, the student will have to discontinue his labours on the upper limb; but, on the completion of that cavity, he must be ready to begin the part of the back that may belong to him. Position.— Whilst the body lies on the back, the thorax Position is to be raised to a convenient height by a block, and the arm, being slightly rotated outwards, is to be placed at a right angle to the trunk of the body. Directions. — Before the dissection is begun, attention should be given by the student to the chief depressions on the surface, to the prominences of muscles, and to the pro- jections of the bones; because these serve as guides to the position of objects beneath the skin. Surface-marking.—Between the arm and the chest is the Marking hollow of the arm-pit, in which the large vessels and nerves face, of the limb are lodged. The extent of this hollow may be ^"'^ seen to vary much with the position of the limb to the trunk; for in proportion as the arm is elevated, the fore and hinder boundaries are carried upwards, and rendered tense, and the depth of the space is diminished. In this spot the skin is of a dark colour, and is furnished with hairs, and large sweat glands. If the arm is forcibly raised and moved in different directions, whilst the fingers of one hand are placed in the arm-pit, the head of the humerus may be recognised. On the outer side of the limb is the prominence of the shouid-248 DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. shoulder; and immediately above it is an osseous arch, which is formed internally by the clavicle, and externally by the spine and the acromion process of the scapula. Con- tinued downwards from about the middle of the clavicle, between the pectoral and deltoid muscles, is a slight depres- sion, in which the coracoid process can be felt near that bone. A second groove is sometimes seen extending outwards from the sternal end of the clavicle ; this corresponds to the interval between the clavicular and sternal origins of the great pectoral muscle. Arm. Along the front of the arm is the prominence of the biceps muscle; and on each side of that muscle is a groove, which subsides inferiorly in a depression in front of the elbow joint. The inner of the two grooves is the most marked, and corresponds to the position of the brachial vessels. Elbow If the elbow joint be semiflexed, the prominences of the outer and inner condyles of the humerus will be rendered evident, especially that on the inner side of the limb. Below the outer condyle, and separated from it by a slight interval, is the projection of the head of the radius, which may be recognised by rotating this bone, the fingers at the same time being placed over it.

Dissec- Dissection.— The dissection is to be commenced by raising raise the the skiu from the side of the chest, and from the arm-pit, so i ()t6gU- ment. as to lay bare the great pectoral muscle and the hollow of the axilla beneath it These parts may be denuded by means of the following incisions:—one is to be made along the middle of the sternum (the whole length); another is to be continued along the clavicle for the inner two thirds of the length of that bone, and thence down the front of the arm as low as the fold of the" arm-pit. From the xiphoid cartilage two other cuts are to be directed outwards:—one is to extend along the free edge of the anterior fold of the arm-pit, till it is a little below the extremity of the other cut on the arm; and is then to be turned across the inner part of the arm as far as to the posterior fold of the arm-pit. The remaining incision is to pass horizontally outwards over the side of the chest, opposite the xiphoid cartilage, as far back as to a level with the posterior fold of the arm-pit. The two ilaps now marked out should be reflected outwards, and beCUTANEOUS NERVES OF THE THORAX. 249 left attached to the body, in order that they may be after- wards used for the preservation of the part. The subcutaneous fascia of the thorax resembles the same Fascia, structure in other parts of the body; but in this locality super- the superficial layer does not contain much fat. Beneath the subcutaneous layer is a deeper and stronger deep. special fascia that closely invests the muscles, and is con- tinuous with the deep fascia of the arm. It is thin on the side of the chest, but becomes much thicker where it is stretched across the axilla. An incision through it, over the arm-pit, will render evident its increased strength in this situation, and its connections with the muscular folds of the axilla which it incases; and if the fore finger be introduced through the opening, some idea will be gained of its capa- bility of confining an abscess in that hollow. Dissection,—The cutaneous nerves of the side of the Dissec- tion of chest are to be next sought in the fat. Some of these (from cuta- , , neous the cervical plexus) will be found crossing the clavicle at nerves of . the the middle, and at the inner part; others (anterior cutaneous chest, of the thorax) appear at the side of the sternum,—one from each intercostal space ; and others (lateral cutaneous of the thorax) should be looked for along the side of the chest, about one inch below the anterior fold of the axilla, there being one from each intercostal space except the first. As soon as the last mentioned nerves appear through the muscles, they are divided into an anterior and a posterior branch: in the highest two nerves the posterior branches are larger than in the rest; they are to be followed across the arm-pit, and a junction is there to be found with a branch (nerve of Wrisberg) of the brachial plexus. Cutaneous nerves of the cervical plexus. — These cross Descend- the clavicle, and are distributed to the integuments over the taLou's pectoral muscle. The most internal branch (sternal) lies cervicli^ near the inner end of the bone, and reaches but a short dis- tance below it. Other branches (clavicular), two or miore in number, and of larger size, cross the centre of the clavicle, and extend to near the lower border of the pectoralismajor; these join one or more of the anterior cutaneous nerves of the thorax. The cutaneous nerves of the thorax are derived from the cutane- trunks of the intercostal nerves between the ribs. Of these branchesDISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. 250 of the in- there are two sets: — one, the lateral cutaneous nerves of nerves the thorax, arise from the trunks of the nerves about mid- are^in -yvay between the spine and the sternum; the other set, the rows, anterior cutaneous nerves of the thorax, are the terminations of the same intercostal trunks at the middle line of the body. One The anterior cutaneous nerves, after piercing the pectoral raSe muscle, are directed outwards in the integuments in the form of slender filaments. The offset of the second nerve joins a cutaneous branch of the cervical plexus ; and the others supply the mammary gland and the integuments. Small cutaneous branches of the internal mammary vessels are found with these nerves. The The lateral cutaneous nerves come between the digitations side^o?" of the serratus muscle, and divide immediately into an These anterior and a posterior branch. There is not usually any ^^^^ lateral cutaneous nerve to the first intercostal trunk ; and that of the second intercostal trunk wants commonly the anterior of the two offsets, into which the other lateral cutaneous nerves bifurcate, anterior The anterior offsets bend forwards over the pectoral muscle, and end in the mammary gland and the integuments.

Office of The MAMMA, or the breast, is the gland for the secretion breast, of the milk, and is situate on the front of the chest, though somewhat towards the lateral aspect. Form The gland is hemispherical in form, and is placed over andposi- great pectoral muscle, but it is rather most prominent with its at the inner and the lower part. Its dimensions and weight sions. vary greatly. In a breast that is not enlarged by lactation, the mamma measures commonly about four inches across ; and extends longitudinally from the third to the sixth orTHE MAMMARY GLAND. 251 seventh rib, and transversely from the side of the stenitrm to the axilla. Its depth is about one inch and a half. The and weight of the breast ranges from six to eight ounces. Nearly in the centre of the gland (rather to the inner side Position of the centre) is the conical or cylindrical projection of the of the nipple or mamilla. This prominence is about half an inch or rather more in length, is slightly turned outwards, and presents in the centre a shallow depression, where it is like- wise rather redder. Around the nipple is a coloured ring, and the — the areola, about an inch in width, whose tint is influenced ^^10^^ is by the complexion of the body; and is altered during the altered, time of menstruation, pregnancy, and lactation.

In the male the mammary gland resembles that of the Breast female in general form; for it is prominent though in a male. much less degree, and it possesses a small nipple, which is surrounded by an areola provided with hairs. The glandular or secretory structure is very imperfect. Structure. — In its texture the mamma resembles those struc- ture. compound glands that are formed by the vesicular endings of branched ducts. During lactation the glandular mass is of a reddish white colour. It consists of small vesicles, which are united to form lobules and lobes. Connected with each lobe is an excretory or lactiferous duct; and the whole is surrounded, and bound together by areolar tissue. A layer of connective tissue, containing fat, surrounds the invest- gland, and penetrates into the interior, subdividing it into lobes. Some fibrous septa fix the ffland to the skin, and and 1 11. . A r^. 1 fibrous support it; these are the ligamenta suspensoria of Sir A. tissue. Cooper. In the ultimate structure of the gland, in the nipple, and in the areola, there is not any fatty substance.

In the nipple the ducts are surrounded by elastic fibrous tissue. Small Some of the lubricating glands beneath the skin of the glands of j^-ppjg ^Yi2d> of the areola are simple sebaceous glands, but others are larger aggregate glands that open in the tu- bercles before mentioned. Arteries JBIoodvessels, nerves, and lymphatics. — The arteries of the breast gland are supplied by the axillary, internal mammary, and intercostal arteries, and enter both surfaces of the organ. The vessels on the cutaneous surface supply branches to the nipple, which pass from and base to apex, being nearly parallel. The veins, after issuing from the substance of the breast, are thus disposed: — some form a plexus on the anterior aspect, and a circle around the areola, and end prin- cipally in the axillary and internal mammary trunks; but others enter one or more of the intercostal veins, or ascend over the in nip. claviclc to join the veins of the neck. In the nipple the veins have Nerves. arrangement like that of the arteries. The nerves are supplied from the anterior and lateral cutaneous nerves of the thorax, viz. Lymph- those of the third, fourth, and fifth intercostal nerves. The lymph- atics pass from either the inner or the outer part of the gland: at the former side they accompany the branches of the internal mammary artery, and open into the anterior mediastinal glands: and on the latter, they reach the axillary glands. Dissec- Dissection, — With the arm in the same position with pectoral rcspcct to the trunk, the student is first to remove the fascia and the fat from the surface of the great pectoral muscle.THE AXILLA. 25'3 In this proceeding the scalpel should be carried in the direction of the fibres, viz. from the arm to the thorax ; and the dissection may be begun at either the upper or lower border of the muscle, according as the one or the other may be the most convenient on the opposite sides of the body. The fascia and the fat are then to be taken from the arm- and the arm-pit. pit, but the numerous vessels, nerves, and glands contained in the space, are to be left uninjured. The dissection will be best begun at the outer part, by removing the fascia from the large axillary vessels, where these are about to quit the space and enter the arm. Following upwards those bloodvessels, the student will arrive at the branches that are directed towards the chest, viz. the long thoracic under cover of the anterior boundary, and the circumflex and subscapular vessels and nerves on the posterior boundary of the axilla. Some arterial twigs enter the axillary glands, and a few should be traced out. In taking away the fascia from the posterior boundary of the space, so as to follow the muscles to their insertion into the humerus, a small nerve (internal cutaneous of the musculo-spiral) should be looked for near the great vessels. The large nerves of the brachial plexus are to be defined; Nerves, with moderate caution they cannot be injured. THE AXILLA. The axilla, or arm-pit, is the hollow between the arm and situa- the chest. It is somewhat conical in form, and its apex is form or directed upwards to the root of the neck. The space ispit^.^^™ larger near the thorax than at the arm, and its boundaries are as follows : — Boundaries, — In front and behind the space is limited Bounda- for the most part by the muscles passing from the trunk of the body to the upper limb ; and the folds of the axilla are constructed by the unattached parts of the fleshy strata. In the anterior boundary are the two pectoral muscles, but The these take unequal shares in its construction in consequence muscles of the difierence in their shape and size: for the pectoralis major extends over the whole front of the space, reaching from the clavicle to the lower edge of the anterior fold;:254 DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. whilst the pectoralis minor, which is a narrow muscle, cor- responds only with the middle part or third of that fold. fJtfssi "^^ posterior boundary, from above downwards, are the TOus, subscapularis, the teres major, and the latissimus dorsi mus- teres.and . i subsca- cles: this boundary reaches lower than the anterior, es- pularis .behind, peciallj near the humerus, and its lower margin, which is formed mostly by the latissimus dorsi, projects forwards beyond the level of the subscapularis. Tarts at On the iuucr side of the arm-pit are the first four ribs, and^""^'^ with their corresponding intercostal muscles, and the part sidS of the serratus magnus that takes origin from those bones.

The base or widest part of the conically-shaped interval is turned downwards, and is closed by the thick aponeurosis that reaches from the anterior to the posterior fold. Contents Contents of the space. — In the arm-pit are contained the space, axillary vessels and the brachial plexus, with their branches; some branches of the intercostal nerves; together with lym- phatic glands, and a larger quantity of loose connective tissue and fat. The position of all these, with reference to the boundaries of the space, is to be carefully studied. Position Position of the vascular and nervous trunks. — The large axillary vessels cross the outer portion of the space in passing from the neck to the upper limb. The part of the vessels that can now be seen, lies close to the humerus, and con- reaching beyond the line of the anterior fold of the arm-pit, of the and is covered only by the common superficial layers, viz. vesselsf the skin, the fatty or superficial fascia, and the deep fascia. Behind the vessels are the tendons of the latissimus and teres muscles. On their outer side is the coraco-brachialis muscle. On looking into the arm-pit from below, the axillary vein will be found to lie to the thoracic side of the artery, and to conceal it. After the vein has been drawn aside, the arterial trunk will be seen to lie amongst some of the large nerves of the upper limb, having the median255 LYMPHATIC GLANDS OF AXILLA. nerve to the outside; the ulnar, and the small nerve of Wrisbergto the inner side; the internal cutaneous generally in front of, and the musculo-spiral nerve behind it. This part of the artery gives branches to the side of the chest and to the shoulder. The vein likewise receives some branches in this spot. Position of the branches of the vessels and nerves, — The situa- *^ tion of several branches of the large vessels and nerves have the branches ^ . of vessels undermentioned position with respect to the boundaries, and Close to the anterior fold, and rather concealed by it, the long thoracic artery extends to the side of the chest; and taking the same direction, though nearer the middle of the arm-pit, are a small artery and vein (external mammary). Extending along the posterior fold, within its lower margin and in contact with the edge of the subscapularis muscle, are the subscapular vessels and nerves; and near the humeral end of the subscapularis the posterior circumflex vessels and nerve bend backwards beneath the large axillary trunks. On the inner boundary, near the upper part, are a few inconsiderable branches of the superior thoracic artery, which ramify on the serratus muscle ; but these are com- monly so unimportant, that this part of the axillary space may be considered free from vessels in respect of any surgical operation. Lying on the surface of the serratus magnus, is the nerve to that muscle ; and perforating the inner boundary of the space, are the lateral cutaneous nerves of the thorax,—two or more offsets of which are directed across the axilla to the arm, and receive the name intercosto-humeral. The lymphatic glands occupy principally the lower and Lymph- hinder parts of the axilla, and lie nearer the chest than the gfands of arm. Commonly they are ten or twelve in number ; but in axuia this particular, as well as in size, they vary much. By their lower ends the glands receive the lymphatic vessels of the arm, of the fore part of the thorax, and of the posterior surface of the back, as well as some of those of the mamma: their efferent ducts unite to form a trunk, which opens into the lymphatic duct of the same side in the neck, or into the end in subclavian vein by a separate tube. Small vascular twigs phllk"" from the branches of the axillary vessels are furnished to '^"^^^ the glands.r \ DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. \ * \ ' The-Iectoralis major is a triangularlj-shaped muscle, wliicli lias its base at the thorax and its apex at the arm.

From this wide origin the fibres take different directions,—those from the clavicle being inclined obliquely downwards, and those from the lower ribs upwards, beneath the former; and all end in a Insertion tondou, which is inserted into the outer edge of the bicipital hume- p-roove of the humerus for about two inches. This muscle rus. bounds the axilla anteriorly, and is connected sometimes to Parts its fellow by fibres in front of the sternum.

The tendon is from two inches to two inches and a half wide, and sends upwards one expansion over the bicipital groove to the head of the humerus, another back- wards to line the groove, and a third to the fascia of the arm. Parts covered by the pectoralis,—The great pectoral muscle Parts covers the pectoralis minor, and forms alone, above and below byThe that muscle, the anterior boundary of the axilla. Between the pectoralis minor and the clavicle it conceals the subcla- vian muscle, the sheath containing the axillary vessels, and the branches that perforate the sheath. Below the small pectoralis it lies on the side of the chest, on the axillary vessels and nerves, and, near the humerus, on the biceps and coraco-brachialis muscles.

It is strong- front, est near the subclavius muscle, where the costo-coracoid band is placed; and it receives below an accession from that same membrane. The anterior part of the tube is per- forated by the acromial thoracic artery and the anterior thoracic nerve. Dissec- Dissection, — The tube of fascia around the vessels will be costo- demonstrated by making a transverse cut in the costo-cora- lascia. coid membrane near the clavicle, so that the handle of the scalpel can be passed beneath it. By raising the lower border of the subclavius this muscle will be seen to be in- cased by fascia, which is attached to the bone both before and behind. Clean After the costo-coracoid membrane has been examined, the remains of it are to be taken away; and the upper part of the axillary vessels and nerves, with their branches, should be carefully cleaned.

The AXILLARY ARTERY is the Continuation onwards of the Axuiary subclavian trunk through the axilla to the upper limb; and the part of the vessel, to which this name is applied, extends from the lower border of the first rib to the lower border of the teres major muscle. In its course through the axillary space, its direction will depend upon the position of the limb to the trunk; for when the arm lies by the side of the body arched in the vessel is curved, its convexity being upwards ; and in axiiia. proportion as the limb is removed to a right angle with the chest the artery becomes straight. In the upper part of the axilla the vessel is deeply placed, but it becomes superficial as it approaches the arm. Its connections with surrounding Has foi. parts are numerous; and the description of these will be connec- . ... . tions: — methodised by dividing the artery into three parts — one above, one beneath, and one below the small pectoral muscle. a. Above the small pectoral muscle the artery is con- above tained in the axillary sheath of membrane; on its thoracic pectoral side is the axillary vein, and on its acromial side lies the brachial plexus, but the cords of the nerves are separated from it by a slight interval. In this part the cephalic vein crosses it, and it is covered by the clavicular portion of the great pectoral muscle. Behind it are the intercostal muscles of the first space and the first digitation of the serratus mag- nus muscle, together with a small nerve, the external respi- ratory. h. Beneath the pectoralis the artery is surrounded by the beneath large nervous cords of the plexus, and is thus separated from muscle, the vein which is still to the inner side, and from the sur- rounding muscles. Superficial to the vessel is the pectoralis minor, with part of the pectoralis major; but there is not any muscle immediately in contact with it behind, for the artery is now placed at the top of the axillary space, parti- cularly when the limb is in the position required by the dissection. c. Beyond the pectoralis minor the artery is concealed and be- yond it. in part by the lower border of the great pectoral muscle, but thence to its termination, it is covered only by the inte- guments and the fascia.

The axillary vein remains as above on vein to ^-j^^ thoracic side of the artery. Branch- The branches of the axillary artery are furnished to the supplied wall of the thorax and to the shoulder. The thoracic thora^x branches are four in number; two of these (superior and acromial thoracic) arise from the artery above the pectoralis minor, one (alar thoracic) beneath the muscle, and one (long thoracic) at the lower border.

Serratus The SERRATUS MAGNUS MUSCLE cxtcnds between the base is attach- of the scapula and the thorax. It arises from the outer sur- ribs and facc and the lower border of the eight upper ribs, about two inches from their cartilages, by pointed processes, which are nine in number in consequence of the second rib having two. The fibres converge towards the base and the angles of the scapula, but from a difference in their direction, the fib?es^ muscle appears to consist of three parts. The upper part is seem to attached internally to the first two ribs and to an aponeurotic form , ^ three arcli between them ; and externally, to an impression on the ventral surface of the upper angle of the scapula. A middle part, which is very thin, extends from the next two ribs (third and fourth) to the base of the shoulder bone. And a lower part, which is the strongest, is connected on the one side with four ribs (fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth), where it digitates with like processes of origin of the ex- ternal oblique muscle; and, on the other side, it is fixed into the rough surface of bone on the costal aspect of the connec- lower angle of the scapula. The muscle is applied against the mus- the ribs and the intercostal muscles, and is partly concealed by the pectoral muscles and the axillary vessels and nerves : in the ordinary position of the arm, the scapula and the sub- scapularis muscle are in contact with it.

Their number, and their depth and size are determined by the intercostal spaces. And the direction of the fibres differs in each stratum; for, whilst those of the external muscle pass very obliquely downwards and forwards, those of the internal layer have an opposite though less oblique direction, so that the fibres cross. The external muscle is fixed to the outer margin of the outer ribs of the corresponding space, and consists of fleshy and ^^^^^ tendinous fibres.

In the intervals corresponding to the true ribs, they differ, cease near the cartilages, and a thin aponeurosis is continued above onwards from the point of ending to the sternum. In the beiow, lower spaces, the muscles are continued between the carti- lages (Theile), and in the last two they reach the ends of the ribs. Dissection.— The internal intercostal muscle will be seen Dissec- by cutting through and removing the external layer in one deeper of the spaces, as for instance the second, where it is widest; the muscle will be recognised by the difference in the di- rection of the fibres. Far back between the two muscles, and close to the rib of nerves above, the intercostal nerve and artery will be found. A vessels, branch of the nerve to the surface (lateral cutaneous of the thorax) should be followed through the external muscular layer; and the trunk of the nerve is to be traced forwards in one or more spaces to the sternum and the surface of the thorax. The hinder part of these muscles will be seen in the dissection of the back, and of the thorax.

After the back is finished, the limb is to be detached from the trunk by sawing the clavicle about the middle, and cutting through the soft parts connected with the scapula. Section II. SCAPULAR MUSCLES, VESSELS, NERVES, AND LIGAMENTS. Position. Position.—After the limb has been separated from the trunk, it is to be placed with the subscapularis uppermost. Dissec Dissection.— The different muscles that have been traced tion of muscles, to the scapula in the dissection of the front of the thorax and the back, are now to be cleaned, and followed to their in- sertion into the bone. A small part of each, about an inch in length, should be left for the purpose of ascertaining more exactly the osseous attachment. Muscles The borders and the angles of the scapula have the fol- lowing muscles connected with them: — into the The Upper margin of the scapula has but one muscle, the S-The"'' omo-hyoid, attached to it. At its origin that muscle is about scapula, j^^^^ wido, and is connected to the edge of the bone behind the notch, but sometimes to the ligament (posterior special) which converts the notch into a foramen. The lower margin, or costa, gives origin to the long head of the triceps, and to some fibres of the teres major; but these attachments to the bone will be ascertained in the progress of the dissection, nto the The base of the bone has many muscles inserted into it. Between the superior angle and the spine, the levator anguli scapulae is inserted. Opposite the spine, the rhomboideus minor is fixed; and between the spine and the inferior angle the rhomboideus major is attached: the upper fibres of the last muscle often end in an aponeurotic arch, andSCAPULAR MUSCLES. 269 are connecte.d indirectly to the bone by means of an ex- pansion from it. Internal to these muscles, and inserted into the whole extent of the base of the scapula, is the ser- ratus magnus muscle. On the angles of the scapula the fibres of the serratus into the magnus are collected in this way: the highest fibres are oFfi^e fixed to the under surface of the upper angle, and the lower fibres are inserted into an impression on the corresponding aspect of the lower angle. On the outer surface of the in- ferior angle lies the teres major, which will be subsequently seen. The insertion of the small pectoral muscle into the front into CO- of the upper part of the coracoid process may be now procSs. ascertained. Dissection.—the separation of the serratus from the Dissec subscapularis a thin fascia comes into view, that belongs to the last muscle, and is fixed to the bone around its margins. After the fascia has been observed, it may be removed; and the muscle is then to be followed forwards to its insertion into the humerus. Next, the axillary vessels and nerves, and the ofi^sets of these to the muscles, should be nicely cleaned. The SUBSCAPULARIS MUSCLE occupies the under surface of subsca- the scapula, and is concealed by that bone, when the limb is in its natural position. The muscle arises from all the con- fiiis the cave surface on the ventral aspect of the scapula, except the scapuTaf neck and the angles, and is connected to the ridges of the bone by tendinous processes. It is inserted by a tendon into is in- the small tuberosity of the humerus, and by fleshy fibres info'' into the neck of the bone for nearly an inch below that iur* process. By one surface the muscle bounds the axilla, and connec IS m contact with the axillary vessels and nerves and the serratus magnus. By the other, it rests against the scapula and the shoulder joint; and between its tendon and the root of the coracoid process is a bursa, which generally com- municates with the synovial membrane of the shoulder joint. Ihe lower border projects much beyond the bone: it is contiguous to the teres major, and comes into contact with the latissimus dorsi and the long head of the triceps : along this border is the subscapular artery, which here gives backwards its dorsal branch.DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. 270 Dissec- Dissection.— The subscapular muscle is to be next sepa- rated from the bone; and at the same time its tendinous processes of origin, the connection between its tendon of in- sertion and the capsule of the shoulder joint, as well as the bursa^ are to be observed. A small arterial anastomosis on the ventral surface of the bone is likewise to be dissected out. Small The infrascapular artery ramifies on the ventral surface scapular of the scapula, and is an offset of the dorsal branch of the artery. subscapular vessel (p. 261.). It enters beneath the sub- scapularis muscle, and forms an anastomosis with small twigs of the supra and posterior scapular branches. Position Position,— The examination of the muscles on the opposite shoulder, surfacc of the scapula may be next undertaken. For this purpose the scapula is to be turned over, and a block, which is of sufficient height to allow the shoulder to be made pro- minent, is to be placed between it and the arm. Dissec- Dissection, — The skin is to be removed from the pro- the minence of the shoulder, by beginning in front at the an- der. terior border of the deltoid muscle. Some small cutaneous nerves are to be found in the fat: some of these descend from above, over the acromion, and others come to the sur- face about half way down the posterior border of the deltoid muscle.

Dissec- Dissection, — The fat and fascia are now to be taken from deltoid the deltoid muscle, its fibres being made tense at the same time. Beginning at the anterior edge of the muscle, the dissector is to carry the knife upwards and downwards in the direction of the fibres, in order that its coarse, rough, muscular fasciculi may be more easily cleaned. At the same time the fascia may be removed from the back of the scapula, so as to denude the teres major and a part of the infra- spinatus muscle. Deltoid The DELTOID MUSCLE is triangular in form, and has its base at the scapula and clavicle, and its apex at the humerus.271 THE DELTOID MUSCLE.

As the muscle is raised a large thick bursa between it and the nead of the humerus comes into sight.

Section III. THE FRONT OF THE ARM. Position,— For the dissection of the anterior part of the Position arm the limb should lie flat on the table, with the front upper- most. Dissection,— The skin is to be raised from the front of and inci- the arm and the front of the elbow joint. To allow of its tiie"^^" reflection, make one incision along the centre of the biceps ^'^'"* as far as two inches below the elbow; and at its termination, a second cut half round the forearm. The skin should now be stripped from the front and back of the limb, as low as the transverse incision, so that the fat or superficial fascia which contains the cutaneous vessels and nerves may be de- nuded. Between the skin and the prominence of the ole- cranon a large bursa may be seen. The cutaneous veins may be first sought in the fat. These Seek vessels are very numerous below the bend of the elbow, and ciirr"^^" issue from beneath the integument. One in the centre of the forearm is the median vein, which bifurcates rather below the elbow. External to this is a small vein (radial) ; and internal to it are the anterior and posterior ulnar veins, coming from the front and back of the forearm. In the arm these veins are united into two; one (basilic) is to be followed along the inner border of the biceps, and the other (cephalic) along the outer side of that muscle. The cutaneous nerves may be next traced out. On the Trace outer side of the arm, about its middle, are the external ous^"*^" cutaneous branches (two in number) of the musculo-spiral; Sf outer and in the outer bicipital groove, in front of the elbow or ^'^^ rather below it, is the cutaneous part of the musculo- cutaneous nerve. On the inner part of the limb the nerves and to the surface are more numerous. Taking the basilic vein ^Xof as a guide, the internal cutaneous nerve of the forearm will y^^Xi. be found by its side, about the middle of the arm; and rather external to this nerve is a small cutaneous offset from it, TDISSECTION OF THE ARM. 278 which pierces the fascia higher up. Behind the internal cutaneous, in the lower third of the arm, is the small nerve of Wrisberg; and in the upper third at the same aspect, are the small nerves that have been already met with in the dissection of the axilla, viz. the intercosto-humeral, and the internal cutaneous of the musculo-spiral. Super- The superficial fascia forms a continuous investment for ficial fat. the limb, but it is thicker in front of the elbow than in the other parts of the arm. In that spot it encloses the super- ficial vessels and lymphatics, and it may be divided into two layers. Thecu- Cutaneous Veins.— The position and the connections of veins are the superficial veins in front of the elbow are to be atten- tively noted by the dissector, because the operation of vene- section may be practised in them, median The median vein of the forearm divides into two branches, vein; internal and external, rather below the bend of the elbow; and at its point of division it is joined by an ofi*set from a divides deep vein. The internal branch (median basilic) crosses to branch- the inner border of the biceps, and unites with the ulnar veins to form the basilic vein of the inner side of the arm. The external branch (median cephalic) is usually longer than the other, and by its junction with the radial vein gives rise to the cephalic vein of the arm. Position Branches.—The median cephalic vein is directed obliquely and con- i. j nections outwards, and lies over the hollow between the biceps and of me- ^ dian ce- the outor mass of muscles of the forearm. Beneath it is the phalic, trunk of the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and over it some small offsets from that nerve are directed. This vein is altogether removed from the brachial artery, and is gene- rally smaller than the median basilic vein. If opened with a lancet, it does not generally yield much blood, in conse- quence of its position in a hollow between muscles rendering and of compression of it very uncertain and difiicult. The median dian ba- hasiUc vciu is usually more horizontal in direction than the vein. preceding, and crosses the brachial artery as it tends to the inner side of the limb. It is larger than the corresponding vein of the outer side of the arm, and is firmly supported by the fascia beneath, only the aponeurosis of the arm, strengthened by fibres from the tendon of the biceps, inter- vening between it and the brachial vessels. Branches ofCUTANEOUS NERVES OF THt ARM. 279 the internal cutaneous nerve lie beneath it, and some twigs of the same nerve are placed over it. The median basilic is the vein on which the operation of vene- bloodletting is commonly practised. It is selected in COnse- is prac. quence of its usually larger size and its more superficial th?s position, and the facility with which it may be compressed; but from the close proximity of the vein to the brachial vessels, the spot chosen for the venesection should not be immediately over the trunk of the artery. The basilic vein, commencino; near the inner condvle of basilic ^ o J vein on the humerus in the manner before said, ascends near the 'r*"^'^^. side of inner border of the biceps muscle to the middle of the arm, ^^"^ where it passes beneath the deep fascia and is continuous with the axillary vein. In this course it lies over, or to the inner side of the brachial artery. The cephalic vein is derived chiefly from the external Cephalic branch of the median, for the radial vein is oftentimes very outer small. It is continued to the shoulder along the outer side the arm of the biceps, and sinks between the deltoid and pectoral muscles, near the clavicle, to open into the axillary vein. The superficial lymphatics of the arm lie for the most ^^V^^- part along the basilic vein, and enter into the glands of the lympha- axilla. A few lymphatics accompany the cephalic vein, and passing between the pectoral and deltoid muscles, end as the others in the axillary glands. A lymphatic gland is com- monly found as^low in the limb as the elbow, where it lies in front of the inner condyle of the humerus. Cutaneous Nerves.— The superficial nerves of the arm Thesu- appear on the inner and outer sides, and spread so as to Serves^^ cover the circumference of the limb. All with one exception rived (intercosto-humeral) are derived from the brachial plexus, brachial either as distinct branches, or as offsets of other nerves, exc^ept' one. On the outer side of the limb are branches of the musculo- spiral and musculo-cutaneous nerves; on the inner side are two internal cutaneous nerves direct from the plexus (large and small), a third internal cutaneous from the musculo- spiral, together with the intercosto-humeral nerve. External cutaneous Nerves. — The external cutaneous Two ex- branches of the musculo-spiral nerve are two in number, and ap- ciua-^ pear at the outer side of the limb in the spot before mentioned, ^^ig.

Deep The aponeurosis of the arm is a white shining membrane the arm that envelops the limb, and sends inw^ards processes between the muscles. Over the biceps muscle it is thinner than elsewhere. At certain points it receives accessory fibres from the subjacent tendons:—thus in front of the elbow there is an ofifset from the tendon of the biceps, and near the axilla the tendons of the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and teres, send prolongations to the fascia. At the upper part of the limb the fascia is continuous with that of the axilla, and is prolonged over the deltoid and pectoral muscles281 MUSCLES OF THE ARM. to the scapula and the clavicle. Inferiorly it is continued to forms the forearm, and is connected to the prominences of bone muscu- around the elbow joint, especially to the condyloid ridges of septa, the humerus.

And to keep in place the vessels and nerves at the upper part of the limb, they should be tied together with string, as nearly as may be in their natural position, and then fastened to the coracoid process. Position. — The limb is still to lie on the back, but the Position upper part is to be raised by means of a small block beneath the scapula, and this bone is to be fixed in such a position as to render tense the muscles. The inner surface of the arm is to be placed towards the dissector.

In raising the fascia the knife must be carried in the direction of the fibres of the biceps muscle, and care must be taken not to displace the brachial artery and the nerves that are with it. Muscles on the Front of the Arm. — The most promi- position nent muscle along the centre of the arm is the biceps; and muscles the one along its inner side, reaching about half way down, arm.^ is the coraco-brachialis. The brachialis anticus muscle is beneath the biceps. Some muscles of the forearm are con- nected to the outer and inner condyles of the humerus, as well as to the line above the outer condyle. The BICEPS MUSCLE forms the prominence observable on Biceps the front of the arm. It is wider at the middle than at short either end; and the upper part of the muscle consists of two head, tendinous pieces or heads, of different lengths, which are attached to the scapula. The short head arises from the origin apex of the coracoid process in common with the coraco- scapula, brachialis muscle; and the long head is attached to the upper part of the glenoid cavity of the scapula, within the capsule of the shoulder joint.

Its fibres end below in a tendon, which is inserted into a ridge on the inner side of the hu- merus, that separates the anterior and posterior surfaces, and below the attachment of the deltoid muscle on the outer aspect; from its tendon of insertion an aponeurotic slip is Connec- continued upwards to the head of the humerus. Part of the tions of I'l ii sur- muscle IS beneath the pectoralis major, and lorms a promi- round- • i 'n i i • • i ing nence m the axilla ; but the rest is superficial, except at the ^'^^ ^' insertion where it is covered by the brachial vessels and the median nerve. The coraco-brachialis conceals the subsca- pular muscle, the anterior circumflex artery, and the tendons of the latissimus and teres. Along the inner border is the large artery of the limb with its nerves. Perforating it is the musculo-cutaneous nerve. Brachial The BRACHIAL ARTERY is a Continuation of the axillary extends trunk, and supplies vessels to the upper limb. It begins at toe ow. iQ^er border of the teres major muscle, and ends rather below the bend of the elbow, or " opposite the neck of the radius," in two branches — radial and ulnar, for the forearm. Position In the upper part of its course the vessel is internal to the to bone, a x x .THE BRACHIAL ARTERY. 283 humerus, but afterwards it is in front of that bone ; and its si- ^ ^ , tuatioii situation is indicated, on the surface, by the depression alonj^ in the ^ , , ^ limb. the inner border of the biceps and coraco-brachialis muscles. In all its extent the brachial artery is very superficial; for Connec- it is covered only by the integuments and the deep fascia, with muscles except at the bend of the elbow where it is crossed, in addi- and fasciae, tion, by the median basilic vein and the prolongation from the tendon of the biceps. Posteriorly the artery has the following muscular connections: whilst it is inside the hu- merus it is placed over the long head of the triceps, and on the inner head of the same muscle ; but when the vessel has turned to the front of the bone, it lies on the insertion of the coraco-brachialis and on the brachialis anticus. To the outer side of the vessel are the coraco-brachialis and biceps muscles, the latter somewhat overlapping it in the lower part of the arm. Veins, — Yenae comites lie on the sides of the artery, en- with T . . veins, circling it with branches ; and the basilic vein is near the line of the artery, but separated from it by the fascia in the lower half of the arm. The nerves in relation with the artery are the following: and with — The internal cutaneous is in contact with the vessel until it has perforated the fascia about the middle of the arm. The ulnar nerve lies to the inner side as far as the insertion of the coraco-brachialis muscle; and the musculo-spiral is behind the artery for a distance of about two inches. The median nerve is close to the vessel in all its course, but alters its position in this way: — as low as the insertion of the coraco-brachialis the nerve is on the outer side, but it then crosses obliquely either over or under the artery, and is placed internal to the vessel about two inches above the elbow joint. Branches spring both externally and internally from the its brachial artery. Those on the outer side are muscular, and al^e"^ supply the coraco-brachialis and biceps ; those on the inner [J"^'^"" side are named superior and inferior profunda, anastomotic, and nutritious arteries. a. The superior profunda branch is larger than the others, and superior leaves the artery near the lower border of the tendon of the teres Sa^^""" major; it winds backwards with the musculo-spiral nerve to the triceps muscle, and will be dissected with the back of the arm.284 DISSECTION OF THE ARM. inferior h. The inferior profunda branch arises opposite the coraco- fuiida, brachialis muscle, and accompanies the ulnar nerve to the interval between the olecranon and the inner condyle of the humerus. In the spot mentioned, it anastomoses with the posterior ulnar recur- rent and anastomotic branches, and supplies the triceps. It often arises in common with the superior profunda artery, nutrient c. A uutritious artery to the bone is given off near the preceding bonef branch, and enters the large aperture about the middle of the hu- merus ; it is distributed to the osseous substance, and to the mem- brane lining the medullary canal, and anas- d. The anastomotic branch arises from one to two inches above the elbow, and courses transversely inwards, through the inter- muscular septum, to the hollow between the olecranon and the inner condyle of the humerus. Here the artery inosculates with the inferior profunda and the posterior ulnar recurrent branch, and gives some branches to the triceps muscle: one of the muscular offsets forms an arch across the back of the humerus, with a branch of the superior profunda, near the articulation of the elbow. The anastomotic branch likewise sends an offset in front of the elbow joint, which joins with the anterior ulnar recurrent, and supplies the pronator teres muscle. Veins The bvacMal veins are placed along the artery, one on the each side, and have branches of communication across that axillary, ^^g^^j , they recoivo contributing veins, which correspond to the branches of the arteries. Superiorly they join the ax- illary vein near the subscapular muscle. Devia- Peculiarities of the artery in position, — The brachial trunk may position, leave the inner border of the biceps in the lower half of the arm, and course along the inner intermuscular septum, with or without the median nerve*, to the inner condyle of the humerus. At this spot the vessel is directed to its ordinary position in front of the elbow, either through or beneath the fibres of the pronator teres, which has then a wide origin. In this unusual course the artery is often found to lie behind a projecting bony point in the hu- merus. In place In the division. — Occasionally the artery is split for a short dis- sion^^' tance at its upper part, like the main vessel in the lower limb. And the terminal bifurcation of the vessel may be short of the ordinary spot, or beyond it:—the former condition is much the most frequent; for only in one instance did Mr. Quain find the * I have seen the nerve in this unusual position without its com- panion artery, being accompanied by an offset from the superior pro- funda.NERVES OF THE ARM. 285 vessel carried farther Into tbe limb before it bifurcated, and in that example the point of division was *' between two and three inches" beyond the elbow joint. In the origin of the arteries of the forearm, — The arteries o"ugj,!j\" the forearm, viz. radial, ulnar, and interosseous, may be carried arteries ♦ -I 1 'M of tbre- backwards, along the parent trunk, to any pomt between the axilla arm. and the common source at the elbow; but this unusual origin is not seated with equal frequency on every part of the humeral trunk, for it is most common in the upper third, and least frequent in the middle third where a ligature may be applied. When one of the vessels referred to thus deviates from the ordinary condition, there would be two large arteries in the arm in the place of one; and these commonly lie close together, though sometimes one of them, viz. the trunk that is to supply the front of the forearm and the palm of the hand, will lie close to the intermuscular septum, with the median nerve, like the trunk of the brachial artery. In some few cases the brachial artery has been observed to Unustuii divide into three instead of two branches (radial, ulnar, and inter- ing. osseous) at some little distance above the elbow, so that three trunks would be present in a given part of the arm. In one case the three arteries of the forearm sprang from the end of the brachial below the elbow, a condition resembling the origin of the arteries of the lower limb from the end of the popliteal trunk. In aberrant branches. — Occasional long slender vessels, vasa in aber- aberrantia," connect the brachial or the axillary trunk with one of branch- the arteries of the forearm, or with a branch of them. These ^^*' accessory vessels very rarely end in the ulnar artery. In muscular covering.— In some bodies the humeral artery is in mus. covered by an additional slip of origin of the biceps or the bra- vering.' chialis anticus muscle. And sometimes a slip of the brachialis may conceal, in cases of high origin of the radial, the remainder of the arterial trunk that continues to the forearm, Nerves of the Arm. — The nerves on the front of the Nerves on front arm are derived from the terminal cords of the brachial of arm- plexus. Few of them furnish offsets to the arm, but they are continued, for the most part without branching, to the forearm and the hand. The cutaneous branches of some of them have been referred to (p. 279.). The median nerve arises from the brachial plexus by two Med inn nerve in roots, one from the outer, and the other from the inner cord the arm of the nerves (p. 262.); its destination is the palm of the the ar- liand, and it accompanies the brachial artery to the forearm. Commencing on the outer side of the artery, the nerve crosses over or under the vessel about the middle of the armDISSECTION OF THE ARM. as before said (p. 283.), and is found on the inner side a little above the elbow. It does not give any branch in the arm, but there may be a fasciculus connecting it with the musculo-cutaneous nerve. Its connections with muscles are the same as those of the artery. The ulnar nerve is derived from the inner cord of the itsdific ^^'^^^^^^1 plexus, and in its progress to the inner side of the tion. hand, it courses along the inner part of the arm, and enters the forearm at the inner side of the elbow joint. At first the nerve lies close to the inner side of the axillary, and then to the same side of the brachial artery as far as the insertion of the coraco-brachialis : but in the remainder of the arm it leaves the vessel, and directed inwards through the inner intermuscular septum, it descends, almost surrounded by the muscular fibres of the triceps, to the interval between Is with, the olecranon and the inner condyle. There is not any branch brauch given from this nerve till it reaches the elbow joint, as'the but a branch from the musculo-spiral to the triceps muscle elbow. . ^ accompanies it in the lower part of its course. Internal The internal cutaneous is a tegumentary nerve of the fore- neous arm, to which it is prolonged like the others. Part of the nerve x o beneath ucrvo has bccn before seen, and only that small portion fascia, which is beneath the fascia of the limb, remains to be studied in the arm. Arising from the inner cord of the plexus, it is at first internal, and then becomes superficial to the humeral artery as far as the middle of the arm, where it divides into two branches that perforate the investing fascia (p. 280.). Near the axilla it furnishes a small cutaneous ofiset to the integuments of the arm, which pierces the fascia higher than the trunk of the nerve. Nerve of The Small internal cutaneous nerve (nerve of Wrisberg *) berg is distributed in the part of the arm now dissected. It arises with the preceding. Concealed at first by the axil- lary vein, it is directed inwards, either beneath or through the vein, and joins with the intercosto-humeral nerve, beneath Afterwards it lies along the inner part of the arm, as far as fascia, the middle, where it perforates the fascia to end in the inte- gument (p. 280.). * An account of this nerve is given by Klint.

The musculO'Cutaneous nerve (nerv. perforans, Casserii) Muscu- 1 • 1 T 1 T • lo-cuta- is SO named from supplying both muscles and integument: neous it ends on the surface of the forearm, and supplies offsets to the arm. the flexors of the elbow joint whilst it is passing through the upper arm. It leaves the outer cord of the brachial plexus opposite the lower border of the pectoralis minor, and perforates directly the coraco-brachialis : it is then di- rected obliquely to the outer side of the limb, between the biceps and brachialis anticus muscles. Near the elbow, its continuation has been seen to become a cutaneous nerve of the forearm. The nerve furnishes branches to the muscles in front of JJf,^"^' the humerus, viz. to the coraco-brachialis, as it passes gg^"^^" through the fibres, and to the biceps and brachialis anticus muscles where it lies between them. Before perforating the coraco-brachialis, the nerve gives usually a separate twig to that muscle and the short head of the biceps; and sometimes there is a large branch of communication with the median nerve after it has pierced the muscle. Dissection, — The brachialis anticus muscle will be brought P'^^sec- ^ tion. into view by cutting through the tendon of the biceps near the elbow, and turning upwards this muscle. The fascia and connective tissue should be taken from the surface, and the lateral extent of the muscle defined; so as to show that the brachialis reaches the intermuscular septum largely on the inner side, but only for a short distance above, on the outer side. The BRACHIALIS ANTICUS covcrs the elbow joint, and the Brachia- lower half of the front of the humerus. It arises from all cni the anterior surface of the humerus below the insertion of Origin, the deltoid muscle, and from the intermuscular septa on the sides, though in very unequal proportions, viz. from all the inner, but from only the upper part of the outer one. The fleshy fibres converge to a tendon, which is inserted into the inser- impression on the ulna before the coronoid process. This muscle is concealed by the biceps, by the brachial artery, and by the median, and the musculo-cutaneous and musculo- spiral nerves; and it lies on the humerus and the articula- tion of the elbow. Its origin embraces by two parts the Position , PITT. -I attacnment oi the deltoid, and its insertion is placed between eibow two corresponding fleshy pieces of the flexor profundusDISSECTION OF THE ARM. 288 and con- digitorum.

The tendon of insertion will be seen in the dissection of the forearm. BACK OF THE ARM. Posit'on Position,—During; the examination of the back of the of the . . ^ part. arm the limb is to be turned over, and raised into a semi- flexed position by means of a block of moderate thickness beneath the elbow. The scapula is to be drawn away, till it is nearly in a line with the humerus, so as to tighten the muscular fibres; and it is then to be fastened with hooks in that position. How to Dissection, — On the back of the arm there is only one lay bare ... triceps, musclc, the triceps, with the superior profunda nerve and artery beneath it. The muscle will be readily laid bare, for it is covered only by fascia — the skin having been before reflected, if the directions before given have been followed by the dissector. To take away the fascia, an incision is to be carried along the limb to rather below the elbow; and in reflecting it the subfascial loose tissue should be removed at the same time. Triceps The TRICEPS musclc is divided superiorly into three parts ; muscle ^ ... three ^ conscquence, three heads of origin to it, — inner, heads, outcr, and middle, have been described. Two of these are attached to the humerus, and one to the scapula. Origin The middle piece, or head, is the lono-est, and has a ten- ofmid- . . , . . ^ ' die head, diuous oHgin, about an inch wide, from the inferior costa oi the scapula close to the glenoid cavity, where it is con- of outer nected with the capsule of the shoulder joint. The external head reaches from the outer condyle of the humerus to the insertion of the teres minor muscle, and is attached to the outer portion of the posterior surface of that bone, between the points mentioned, as well as to the intermuscular septum and of of the same side. The internal head reaches from the inner head! cond^e to the upper border of the tendon of insertion of the - teres major into the bicipital groove, and arises from theTHE TRICEPS MUSCLE. 289 contiguous intermuscular septum, and the inner portion or half of the posterior surface of the bone. From these pro- cesses of origin the fibres are directed to a common tendon of insertion at the lower part, with different degrees of inser- inclination : — those of the middle head are directed verti- cally, but those of the inner and outer heads pass inwards and downwards to the sides and the under part of the tendon, fibres. The muscle is inserted inferiorly into the end of the olecra- non process of the ulna, and gives an expansion to the aponeurosis of the forearm : between the tip of the olecranon and the tendon is a small bursa.

On the sides the muscle is united to the intermuscular septa, and the lower fibres of the outer head are continuous with the anconeus — one of the muscles of the forearm. Suhanconeus muscle, — This is a thin fleshy stratum sub- in i«i 1 1 anconeal beneath the triceps near the elbow, which may be seen by slip, cutting through that muscle at the lower part. It consists of two fasciculi, inner and outer: these are attached above the fossa for the olecranon, and end in the capsule of the joint. A corresponding muscle is placed beneath the ex- tensor of the knee joint. The intermuscular septa are processes of fibrous struc- Two in- . , , . . • r» -I tennus- ture, continuous with the investing aponeurosis oi the arm, cuiar which are fixed to the ridges leading to the condyles of the ^^^'^ humerus: they intervene between the muscles on the front attached and back of the lower half of the arm, and give attachment of hu?^^ to the fleshy fibres. The internal is the strongest, and reaches as high as the coraco-brachialis muscle, from which and it receives some tendinous fibres: the brachialis anticus is attached to it in front, and the triceps behind; and the ulnar nerve and the inferior profunda and anastomotic arteries pierce it. The external septum is thinner, and ceases at outer, the deltoid muscle. Behind it is the triceps ; and in front of it are the brachialis anticus, and the muscles of the fore- arm that arise above the condyle of the humerus (supinator longus and extensor carpi radialis longus) : it is pierced by the musculo-spiral nerve. u290 DISSECTION OF THE ARM. Dissec- Dissection,— To follow now the superior profunda vessels vessels and the musculo-spiral nerve, the middle head of the triceps nerve, sliould be cut across over them, and any fatty tissue that may obscure their position should be removed. To trace out the branches of the nerve and artery, that descend to the olecranon and the anconeus muscle, the triceps is to be divided in its whole length, and along the line of union of the outer with the middle head. The trunks of the vessel and nerve are to be afterwards followed beneath the outer head of the triceps to the front of the humerus. Superior The Superior profunda branch of the brachial artery profunda f . n n r> • artery (p. 283.) is tlio chicf vcsscl for the supply of the triceps muscle. Accompanying the musculo-spiral nerve, it turns lies be- to the back of the humerus in the interval between the hind the rus™^" inner and outer heads of the triceps. In this position the artery supplies large muscular branches, and is then con- tinued onwards beneath the external head of the triceps to the outer part of the arm, where it divides into its terminal twigs: — one of these courses on the nerve to the front of the elbow joint, anastomosing with the recurrent radial artery: whilst others continue to the elbow along the intermuscular septum, and join the interosseous recurrent artery. Supplies Branches.— The muscular offsets of the vessel descend to triceps, ^1^^ olecranon, supplying the triceps, and communicating c^Jde ^ with the other branches of the brachial artery, viz. inferior join""^ profunda and anastomotic (p. 284.), as well as with the re- current branches of the arteries of the forearm. One offset deserved especial notice; it accompanies a distinct branch of the musculo-spiral nerve, and ends in the anconeus muscle in the interval between the olecranon and the outer condyle of the humerus. Mus- The musculo-spiral nerve arises from the posterior cord spimi of the brachial plexus, of which it is the largest trunk, and winds IS continued along the back, and the outer part of the limb humerus to the hand. In the arm the nerve is first placed behind, and close to the axillary and brachial arteries; but it soon leaves the last vessel, and winds with the profunda artery from the inner to the outer part of the arm, beneath the to outer triceps muscle. At the outer aspect of the limb it is con- the arm. tinued between the brachialis anticus and supinator longus muscles to the external condyle of the humerus, in front of291 SHOULDER JOINT. u 2 which it divides into the radial and posterior interosseous nerves. In this extent the nerve gives muscular branches, and cutaneous offsets to both the inner and outer parts of the arm. a.

The muscular branches to the triceps are numerous, and sup- plj all the three heads. One slender offset, that is distributed to triceps, the inner head, arises in common with the preceding cutaneous branch, and lies close to the ulnar nerve, till it enters the muscu- lar fibres at the lower third of the arm. And a long slender branch behind the humerus, that appears as if it ended in the triceps, can be followed downwards to the anconeus muscle. On the outer brachi- part of the limb the musculo-spiral nerve supplies the brachialis muscles anticus, and two muscles of the forearm, viz. supinator longus and arm."^^" extensor carpi radialis longior. c. The external cutaneous branches are two in number: they Two) perforate the outer head of the triceps at its attachment to the cuta-"^ humerus, and are distributed in the integument of the arm and forearm (p. 279.). Dissection, — Now the dissection of the arm has been Dissec- tion of completed as far as the elbow, it will be advisable to examine the ^ . , ' , shoulder next the shoulder joint. For this purpose the tendons of the joint, surrounding muscles, viz. those of the subscapularis, supra- and infraspinatus, and teres minor, must be detached from the joint. On the removal of the connective and some loose fibrous tissue, the articular capsule, with a thickened band on the fore part, will be prepared. Shoulder Joint.—The joint is formed between the head shoulder of the humerus and the glenoid fossa of the scapula, these outline parts being inclosed in a fibrous capsule lined by a synovial membrane. A ligamentous band (glenoid ligament) deepens the shallow cavity for the reception of the large head of the humerus. This articulation has great extent of movement; and the bones entering into its formation are but slightly bound together by ligamentous bands, for, on the removal of the muscles, the articular surface of the humerus may be drawn from the other with great readiness.DISSECTION OF THE AEM. 292 Capsular The capsulav ligament surrounds the articular ends of the ment. bouos, and receives some fibres from the contiguous tendons. At the upper part it is fixed around the neck of the scapula, where it is connected with the long head of the triceps. Attach- At the lower part the li2:ament is attached to the humerus ments.. ^ ^ close to the hemispherical articular surface ; but its conti- nuity is interrupted between the tuberosities of that bone by the tendon of the biceps muscle. On the inner side, below the coracoid process, there is generally an aperture in the capsule through which the synovial membrane of the joint is continuous with the bursa beneath the tendon of the sub- Muscics scapularis. The following muscles surround the articula- around. . ^ . i n i tion: — superiorly are the tendons oi the supraspmatus, in- fraspinatus, and teres minor ; inferiorly the capsule is only partly covered by the subscapularis : and internally it is well supported by the last named muscle. Acces- On the front of the capsule is a rather thick band of band, fibres, — the coraco-kumeral or accessory ligament, which springs from the base of the coracoid process of the scapula, and ends in the great tuberosity of the humerus. i Dissec- Dissection,—The articulation is to be opened by cutting ; ^^°"* through the capsule near the scapula. When this has been I done, the attachment of the capsule to the bones, the glenoid i ligament, and the tendon of the biceps will be fully seen. \ Tendon The tcndon of the biceps muscle arches over the head of bicepl the humerus, and serves the purpose of a ligament in re- j' straining the upward movements of that bone. It is attached to the upper part of the glenoid fossa of the scapula, and is j connected on each side with the glenoid ligament. As it is \ directed outwards, it becomes round, and is received into the | groove between the tuberosities of the humerus, in which it | is covered by a prolongation from the tendon of the pecto- j ralis major muscle, and surrounded by the synovial mem- li brane. Glenoid The glenoid ligament is a firm, fibrous band, that surrounds ment. the fossa of the same name, deepening it for the reception of ': the head of the humerus. It is about two lines in depth, I and is connected in part with the sides of the tendon of the biceps ; but some of its fibres are fixed separately to the I edge of the glenoid fossa. Synovial The Synovial membrane lines the articular surface of the ■■u 3 SURFACE-MARKING OF THE FOREARM. 298 capsule.

Position,— The limb is to be placed with the palm of the Position 1 . (* p ^^^^^ hand uppermost; and the marking of the surface, and the limb. projections of bone, are first to be noted. Surface-marking, — On the anterior aspect of the fore- ^"[J^^^ arm are two depressions, corresponding to the position of the fo^- chief vessels. The external one is placed over the radial artery, and inclines towards the middle of the limb as it ap- proaches the elbow. The internal one is evident only beyond the middle of the forearm, and points out the part of the ulnar artery that is uncovered by muscle. The bones (radius and ulna) are sufficiently near the surface to be traced in their whole length: each ends below in a point, — the styloid process, and that of the radius is the lowest. The articulation of the wrist is about an inch above the trans- verse marking that separates the forearm from the hand. On each side of the palm of the hand is a lateral projec- surface tion ; the external of these is formed by the muscles of the of the" thumb, and the internal by the muscles of the little finger. Between those projections is a hollow, which is pointed towards the wrist. The superficial palmar arch of arteries extends forwards a little way into the hollow, and its posi- tion may be marked by a line drawn across the palm from the root of the thumb, when that digit is placed at a right angle to the hand. Two transverse lines are seen in the palm, but neither reaches completely across it: the anterior one serves to direct to the line of the articulations between the metacarpus and the phalanges, and is about a quarter of an inch behind those joints, when the fingers are extended, except in the case of the fore finger. Transverse lines are seen on both aspects of the ioints of Surface the thumb and the fingers. The lines on the palmar surface fingers,DISSECTION OF THE FRONT OF THE FOREARM. 294 of the fingers may be used to point out the articulations of the phalanges. Thus the joint between the metacarpal phalanx and the next will be found about a line in front of the chief of the transverse grooves, that appear about the middle (in length) of the finger; whilst the articulation between the two last phalanges is situate about a line in front of the single groove which is nearer the tip of the finger. Dissec- Dissection, —With the position of the limb still the same, iemole ^.u iucisiou is to bc carried through the skin along the the skm. j^^^j^jg Qf ^j^g front of the forearm, as far as an inch beyond the wrist; and at its termination another transverse one is to be united with it. The skin is next to be reflected care- fully from the front and back of the forearm, without injury to the numerous superficial vessels and nerves that are beneath; and it should also be taken from the back of the hand, by prolonging the ends of the transverse cut along the margins of the hand to a little beyond the knuckles. One finger should have the integument removed from it, in order that the nerves may be traced to the end. Seek the The Superficial vessels and nerves can be now traced in ciaTves- the fat. They have the following position:—Along the nerves inner side of the forearm are the ulnar veins, with the con- ' tinuation of the internal cutaneous nerve ; and near the wrist there is occasionally a small offset from the ulnar nerve. On the outer side are the radial vein, and the super- ficial part of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. Close to the hand, in the centre of the forearm, is the small palmar branch of the median nerve, behind. At the back of the forearm the external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve is to be traced; and offsets are to be followed to this surface from the nerves in front. On the posterior part of the hand is an arch of superficial veins. The radial nerve, and a branch of the ulnar nerve, should be found on the back of the hand, as they run to the fingers, — one along the outer, the other along the inner border of the hand. subcu- CrxANEOus Veins. — The superficial veins are named taneous titi n iTl. veins of median, radial, and ulnar, from their position m the limb. t!he fore. rT^^ - arm are They commenco in the hand, chiefly at the dorsal aspect, where they form an arch, and are continued along the295 CUTANEOUS VEINS AND NERVES.

The radial vein begins in the outer part of the arch before men- radial; tioned, and in some small radicles from the back of the thumb. It is then continued along the forearm, at first behind and then on the outer border, as far as the elbow, where it gives rise to the cephalic vein by its union with the outer branch of the median vein. The ulnar veins are anterior and posterior, and occupy the front "inai"; two sets and the back of the limb. The anterior arises near the wrist, by anterior the junction of small roots from the hand, and runs on the inner part of the forearm to the elbow ; here it unites with the inner branch of the median, and forms the basilic vein. The posterior and pos- ulnar vein is situate on the back of the limb. It commences on the hand by the union of a large branch, " vena salvatella," from the back of the little finger, with the offset of the venous arch ; it is then continued along the back of the forearm nearly to the elbow, and bends forwards to open into the anterior ulnar vein. The median vein commences on the front of the arm, near the median, wrist, by small branches which are derived from the palmar surface of the hand, and is directed along the centre of the fore- arm nearly to the elbow. Here the vein divides into external and internal branches (median basilic and median cephalic), which unite, as before seen (p. 278.) with the radial and ulnar veins. At its point of bifurcation the median receives a communicating branch from a vein accompanying the artery beneath the fascia. Cutaneous Nerves. — The superficial nerves of the fore- super- arm are continued from those of the arm. viz. on the inner nerves of , forearm part, from the large internal cutaneous nerve ; and on the outer part, from the two external cutaneous nerves derived from the musculo-spiral, and from the musculo-cutaneous.

I^'ear the wrist the nerve is placed over the radial artery, and some twigs pierce the fascia to ramify on the vessel. A little above the middle of the forearm the nerve gives backwards a branch to the integument on the posterior aspect, that reaches nearly to the wrist, and communicates with the radial nerve as well as with the following cutaneous nerve, external The external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve, after ous of passing the elbow, turns to the posterior aspect of the forearm, and io"spirai. reaches as far as the wrist. Near its termination it joins the pre- ceding cutaneous nerve. Ending The 7'adial nerve is distributed to the integument of the back of radial the hand, and to that of the thumb and the next two fingers. It ^^^^^ becomes cutaneous at the outer border of the forearm in the lower third, and after giving backwards some filaments to the posterior aspect of the limb, divides into two branches : — byexter- a. One (external) is joined by the musculo-cutaneous nerve, internal and is distributed to the radial border and the ball of the thumb. ' b. The other branch (internal) supplies the remaining side of the thumb, both sides of the next two digits, and half the ring finger ; so that the radial nerve supplies the same number of digital branches on the dorsal aspect as the median nerve furnishes on the which palmar aspect. This division of the radial nerve communicates the fin- with the musculo- cutaneous and ulnar nerves; and the offset, which is distributed to the contiguous sides of the ring and middle fingers, is joined by a twig from the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve. Termi- Qn the sides of the finojers each of these dorsal digital nerves is nation. . . ® ... united with an offset from the corresponding digital nerve on the palmar surface, and then extends to the tip of the finger, o/uinar '^^^ dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve furnishes offsets to the rest nerve to of the fingers and to the back of the hand. Appearing by the handand Styloid proccss of the ulna, this branch joins in an arch across the back of the hand with the radial nerve, and is then distributed to fingers, both sides of the little finger, and to the contiguous side of the ring finger : moreover, it communicates with the part of the radial nerve that supplies the space between the ring and middle fingers. The ulnar nerve will be afterwards seen to supply branches to the same number of digits on the palmar surface. Deep The aponeurosis of the forearm is continuous with a fascia of the fore^ similar investment of the arm ; it furnishes the muscle?APONEUROSIS OF THE LIMB. 297 with sheaths, and is thicker behind than before. It is of a pearly white colour, and is formed of fibres that cross obliquely. Near the elbow it is stronger than towards the hand; and at that part it receives fibres from the tendons of the biceps and brachialis anticus, and gives origin to the muscles attached to the inner condyle of the humerus. On On the . , bdck of the back of the limb, the aponeurosis is connected to the the umb. margins of the ulna, so as to leave the upper part of that bone subcutaneous; and it receives some fibres from the tendon of the triceps. Horizontal processes are sent down- inter- wards from the aponeurosis to separate the superficial and lar pieces. deep layers of muscles, both on the front and the back of the forearm ; and longitudinal white bands indicate the position of the different intermuscular processes, which isolate one muscle from another, and give origin to the muscular fibres. At the wrist the fascia joins the anterior annular ligament; At the ; and near this band the tendon of the palmaris longus pierces the fascia, and receives a sheath from it. Behind the wrist annular it is thickened by transverse fibres, and gives rise to the ment. posterior annular ligament; but on the back of the hand and fingers the fascia becomes very thin. Dissection. — The skin is to be replaced on the back of the Take forearm and hand, in the same manner as on the back of faS, nerves the arm, in order that the parts that are denuded may not and become dry. Beginning with the dissection of the anterior aspect of the limb, let the student divide the aponeurosis along the front as far as the wrist, and take it away with all the cutaneous vessels and nerves, except the small palmar cutaneous offsets of the median and ulnar nerves near the wrist. In cleaning the muscles, it will be impossible to remove the aponeurosis from them, at the upper part of the forearm, without detaching the muscular fibres. After the aponeurosis has been removed, the termination vessels of the brachial artery will be observed to lie with some fat seen, in a hollow in front of the elbow, between two masses of muscles,—one arising from the inner, and the other from the outer condyle of the humerus. Two large arteries are in part laid bare; one (radial) lies along the radial border, the other (ulnar) is superficial only in the lower half of the forearm, and at the ulnar side. These vessels and their branches should be carefully cleaned.BISSECTION OF THE FRONT OF THE FOREARM.

This Structure is at some little depth from the surface; whilst the student attempts to make it apparent by removing the tissue superficial to it, he must take care of the small branches of the median and ulnar nerves to the palm of the hand. The ulnar artery and nerve pass over the ligament, <and will serve as a guide to it. 'Hollow Hollow in front of the elbow, — The hollow in front of if the" the bend of the elbow corresponds with that of the popliteal space in the leg, and is situate between the inner and the outer mass of the muscles of the forearm. This interval is somewhat triangular in shape, and the wider part is towards Bounda- the humerus. Laterally, it is bounded on the outer side by the supinator longus muscle, and on the inner side by the pronator teres. The aponeurosis of the limb is stretched over the space; and the bones, covered by the brachialis anticus and supinatorbrevismuscles, form the deep boundary, conterfts Contents, — In this hollow are lodged the termination of space the brachial artery with its veins and the median nerve, the musculo-spiral nerve, the tendon of the biceps muscle, and some fatty tissue ; these several parts have the following re- :andtheir lativo position in the space : — the tendon of the biceps is ?oone" directed towards the outer boundary to reach the radius, ;another. .^^^ "which it is inserted; and the musculo-spiral nerve is close to the outer side, being partly concealed by the supi- nator longus muscle. The brachial vessels and the median nerve occupy nearly the centre of the space, the nerve being internal; but as the artery is inclining to the outer part of the limb, they are soon distant from one another about half an inch. In this space the brachial artery divides into two trunks—radial and ulnar, superfi. Muscles on the front of the forearm. — The mus- layer clcs oi\ the autcrior and inner parts of the forearm are muscles, divided into a superficial and a deep layer. In the super- ficial layer there are five muscles, which are fixed to the inner condyle of the humerus, mostly by a common tendon, and lie in the undermentioned order from the middle to the inner side of the limb ; viz. pronator radii teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor carpi ulnaris, which are on the same level; and deeper and larger than any of these isSUPERFICIAL FLEXOR MUSCLES. 299' the flexor sublimis digitorum. The deep layer will be met with in a future dissection. The PRONATOR RADII TERES arisos from the inner condyle Pronator teres. of the humerus by the common tendon, and by fleshy fibres from the ridge above the condyle; from the inner part of the coronoid process by a second tendinous slip; and from origin. the fascia and the intermuscular septum between it and the next muscle. It is inserted by a rather flat tendon into an inser- impression, an inch in length, on the outer surface of the middle of the radius. The muscle is superficial except at its insertion where it is crossed by the radial artery, and is concealed by one of the outer set of muscles (supinator longus). The pronator forms the outer boundary of the K ^ >vA triangular space in front of the elbow; and its inner border is contiguous to the flexor carpi radialis. By gently sepa- connec- rating the muscle from the rest, it will be found to lie on the brachialis anticus, on the flexor sublimis digitorum, and on the ulnar artery and the median nerve. The second small head of origin is directed inwards between the artery and the nerve. The FLEXOR CARPI RADIALIS takes its origin from the Radial common tendon, from the aponeurosis of the limb, and from the wrist the intermuscular septum on each side. The tendon of the muscle, becoming free from fleshy fibres about the middle of the forearm, passes through a groove in the os trapezium, outside the arch of the anterior annular ligament, and is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bones of the index and middle fingers. This muscle rests chiefly on the flexor is super- sublimis digitorum; but near its origin it is in contact with ' ' the ulnar artery and the median nerve, and near the wrist it lies over the flexor longus poUicis, — a muscle of the deep layer. As low as the middle of the forearm the muscle is the corresponds externally to the pronator teres, and below that the ra-^ point to the radial artery, to which its tendon is taken as tery. the guide.

Its origin is connected, like that of the preceding muscle, with the common tendon, the fascia, and lies over the intermuscular septa. Its long thin tendon is continued annular ^ ° lifent ^^o^g centre of the forearm, and over the annular liga- and ends mcnt, to cud in the palmar fascia. The palmaris is situate in fascia ' ^ ^ of palm, between the flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles, and rests on the flexor sublimis digitorum. Flexor The FLEXOR CARPI ULNARIS has an aponeurotic attach- utnaris. mcut to the iuucr condyle of the humerus ; to the inner side Origin. olecranon ; and to the ridge of the ulna, between the internal and posterior surfaces, for three fourths of its length. Most of the fibres are continued vertically downwards, but others obliquely forwards to a tendon which occupies the anterior part of the muscle in the lower half, some joining it inser- as low as the wrist; and the tendon is inserted into the pisi- into pisi- form bone, whilst an offset is sent to the annular ligament, bone, and the muscles of the little finger. One surface of the muscle is in contact with the fascia; and its tendon may be taken as the guide to the ulnar artery, since it can be readily Adjacent felt through the skin. To its radial side are the palmaris and flexor digitorum sublimis muscles, but below the middle of the forearm the ulnar artery and nerve are placed along it. When the attachment to the inner condyle has been di- vided, and the subjacent parts cleaned, the muscle will be seen to conceal the flexor digitorum sublimis and flexor pro- fundus, the ulnar nerve, and the ulnar vessels in part. Between the attachments to the condyle and the olecranon the ulnar nerve enters the forearm. Course The RADIAL ARTERY is ouc of the vcsscls derived from the tent of" bifurcation of the brachial trunk, and its destination is the dial aV- palm of the hand. It is first placed along the outer side of the forearm as far as the end of the radius ; it then winds backwards below the extremity of that bone ; and it enters finally the palm of the hand through the first interosseous space. In consequence of this circuitous course the artery will be found in three different regions ; viz. the front of the forearm, the back of the wrist, and the palm of the hand. Situ- In the front of the forearm. — In this part of the limb the ?n the position of the artery will be marked, on the surface, by arm. a line drawn from the centre of the hollow of the elbow to the fore part of the styloid process of the radius. ThisKADIAL ARTERY AND BRANCHES. 301 vessel is smaller than the ulnar artery, though it appears in direction to be the continuation of the brachial trunk. In all its extent the radial artery is quite superficial, being Coniiec- 1111 • 1 tions covered only by the common tegumentary investments, and with the deep fascia, and during life it can be felt beating as ote\^\t, the pulse near the wrist. Its connections with the surround- ing muscles and the radius are these: — in the upper half of gj^gg'^ the forearm the artery is placed between the supinator longus externally and the pronator teres internally, the former somewhat overlapping it; but below that point it lies between the tendons of the supinator longus and flexor carpi radialis. At first the vessel is on the inner side of the behind ^ ^ ^ and with radius, but afterwards over that bone : it is placed succes- the ■ , radius. sively over the following parts, viz. the fleshy supinator brevis, the tendon of the pronator teres, the thin radial origin of the flexor sublimis, some muscles of the deep layer, viz. flexor pollicis longus and pronator quadratus, and lastly on the end of the radius. The usual venas comites are found veins on the sides of the artery. The radial nerve is on the outer nerve side of, though not in contact with the vessel, in the upper two thirds of the forearm, or until it passes backwards be- neath the tendon of the supinator longus, and becomes cu- taneous. Branches, — The radial artery furnishes many unnamed Branch- 111 1. esboth muscular and nutrient branches to the surrounding parts : muscu- , , - . . _ ^ ^ ' lar and and three named branches, viz. recurrent radial, superficial anasto- . ^ motic. volar, and anterior carpal. a. The radial recurrent is the first branch of the artery, and Radial supplies the muscles of the outer side of the limb. Its course is rent.' almost transverse to the supinator longus muscle, beneath which it terminates in muscular ramifications. One offset ascends beneath the supinator, and anastomoses with the superior profunda branch of the brachial artery. h. The superficial volar branch usually arises near the lower Super- end of the radius, but its exact place of origin is uncertain. It is volar, directed towards the palm of the hand, across or through the mass of muscles in the ball of the thumb, and it either ends in those muscles, or joins the superficial palmar arch. c. The anterior carpal branch is very inconsiderable in size, and Anterior will be seen in the examination of the deep layer of muscles. Arising rather above the lower end of the radius, this artery passes transversely beneath the muscles, and anastomoses with a similarDISSECTION OF THE FRONT OF THE FOREARM. 302 branch from the ulnar artery. From the arch thus formed at the lower border of. the pronator quadratus muscle, offsets are given to the carpus. yaria- Peculiarities of the radial artery.—The origin of the radial artery the ori- Hiay be carried upwards in the arm, from the usual place even to the axilla; and the unusual beginning of this vessel in the humeral is much more frequent than that of either of the other arteries of the forearm, bearing to their variation in this particular the pro- portion in a given number of cases of about three to four. In one instance (Quain), it was noticed between two and three inches below the elbow joint, and in that case a vas aberrans connected it and with the axillary artery. When the radial artery has a high course o ^^j^jj^^ (.Q^pge fhe arm is close to the brachial artery, along radial. edge of the biceps muscle; and in passing the bend of the elbow it may be occasionally subcutaneous, viz. above the deep fascia, and be liable to injury in venesection. In the forearm it may be likewise subcutaneous, and superficial to the supinator longus muscle. Connect- The aberrant arteries^ " vasa aberrantia," or the long slender branch- branches of the axillary or brachial trunks, open commonly into the radial artery. In some cases of high origin of the radial, there is a connecting branch, at the bend of the elbow, between that irregular vessel and the trunk in the place of the brachial Dissec artery. Dissection. — To bring into view the remaining muscle of the superficial layer (flexor sublimis digitorum), the origin of the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus must be cut through near the inner condyle of the humerus, and turned to one side. Small branches of the ulnar artery and median nerve may be seen to enter the under surface of those muscles.

The flexor sublimis is concealed above by the other Connec- tions muscles of the superficial layer; and the radial vessels lie on with the attachment to the radius. Along the inner border is around, the flexor carpi ulnaris, with the ulnar vessels and nerve. The tendons of the muscle are arranged in pairs before they enter beneath the annular ligament of the wrist; those of the middle and ring fingers being anterior, and those of the index and little finger posterior in position. When the coronoid and condyloid attachments are divided, the muscle will be seen to cover two flexors of the deep layer (flexor digitorum profundus and flexor poUicis), the median nerve and the upper part of the ulnar artery. The ULNAR ARTERY is the larger of the two branches from uinar artery the bifurcation of the brachial trunk, and is directed along ends the inner side of the limb to the palm of the hand. At its hand, extremity it forms the superficial palmar arch, and joins the radial artery. In the forearm the vessel has an arched direction, and its Connec- . . tions in depth from the surface varies m the first and last parts of the ^ upper its course. In the upper half of the forearm the artery is inclined obliquely inwards, between the superficial and deep layers of muscles, and is covered by the former, viz. by the pronator teres, flexor sublimis, palmaris longus, and flexor carpi radialis. But below the spot mentioned, the vessel is and quite superficial between the tendons of the flexor sublimis haifof and flexor carpi ulnaris, and is concealed only by the com- arm. mon integuments and the proper fascia of the limb, though the flexor ulnaris somewhat overlays it, and serves as the guide to its position. Beneath the artery will be found first the brachialis anticus for a short distance, and afterwards the flexor profundus. The two companion veins are situate on the sides of the Position rrn T T veins artery.

About the middle of the forearm, the ulnar nerve approaches the artery, and continues thence on the inner side. A small branch of the ulnar nerve descends on its lower part to the palm of the hand. Position On the annular ligament of the wrist, the artery lies close annular to the pisiform bone, and is crossed by a band of fibres pro- ment. lougcd from the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris to that ligament. The ulnar nerve still accompanies the vessel, having the same position, viz. on the inner side. Its Branches,—The greater number of the collateral branches branches t-i-i i i-r-» besides 01 the artery are distributed to the muscles. But the lar are branches which are named are the following: — anterior The anterior ulnar recurrent branch arises generally in com- ^"^ mon with the next, and turns upwards on the brachialis anticus muscle, to inosculate with the small anastomotic artery beneath the pronator radii teres. It gives offsets to the contiguous muscles, posterior Z>. The posterior ulnar recurrent branch, of larger size than the rent,^" anterior, is directed inwards beneath the flexor sublimis muscle to the interval between the inner condyle and the olecranon. Here it passes with the ulnar nerve between the attachments of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and joins the ramifications of the inferior profunda and anastomotic arteries on the inner side of the elbow joint. Some of its offsets enter the muscles, and others supply the articulation and the ulnar nerve, inter- c. The interosseous branch is a short, thick trunk, about an inch osseous, iQj^g^ which is directed backwards towards the interosseous mem- brane, and divides into anterior and posterior interosseous arteries: these branches will be afterwards followed, meta- d. The metacarpal branch arises from the artery near the lower carpal, ulna, and turns back along the metacarpal bone of the little finger, of which it forms a dorsal branch, and e. The carpal branches (anterior and posterior) ramify on the carpal, ^^.^j^^ r^j^^ back of the carpus, on which they anastomose with cor- responding offsets of the radial artery, and form arches across the wrist. The ori- Peculiarities of the ulnar artery.—The place of origin of the ulnar artery has a tendency to approach the trunk of the body, and it may therefore be changed to any point of the vessel in the arm, or even to that in the axilla; but this deviation is much less frequent in it than in the radial artery. Once the origin was found between two and three inches below the elbow. (Quain.) and Its position in the forearm, when the vessel is irregular, is more the ar-^^ frequently changed than that of the radial under similar circum-ULNAR AND MEDIAN NERVES, 305 Stances. Commonly, in the instances of high origin, the ulnar tery may artery is superficial to the flexor muscles at the bend of the elbow (only one exception, Mr. Quain), but beneath the aponeurosis of the forearm, though sometimes it is subcutaneous with the super- ficial veins. The UL^fAR NERVE enters the forearm between the attach- ulnar ments of the flexor carpi ulnaris to the olecranon and the ?hrfo.e" inner condyle of the humerus. Under cover of that muscle the nerve reaches the ulnar artery about the middle (in length) of the forearm, and is then continued on the inner side of the vessel to the hand. On the annular ligament the nerve is rather posterior to the artery. In this part of the its limb it furnishes articular, muscular, and cutaneous branches aJe"'^'' as below : — a. Articular nerves.—In the interval between the olecranon and to elbow the inner condyle, the ulnar nerve gives slender filaments to the articulation against which it lies. h. Muscular branches.-^li furnishes offsets near the elbow joint to two to two muscles of the forearm, viz. flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor Tfort profundus. One branch enters the upper part of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and the other supplies the inner half of the flexor profundus digitorum. c. Cutaneous nerve of the forearm and hand.— About the middle cutane- of the forearm a small cutaneous branch (palmar) arises from the branch nerve, and continues on the ulnar artery, sending twigs around it ^'"3 to end in the integuments of the palm of the hand.

The dorsal cutaneous nerve of the hand arises about two inches cufa- above the end of the ulna, and passes obliquely backwards beneath ZTeor the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle: it finally perforates the aponeu- l^^a""' rosis of the hmb, and is lost on the back of the hand and finders (p. 296.). The MEDIAN NERVE Icaves the hollow of the elbow between Median the heads of origin of the pronator teres, and takes the middle Imeof the limb in its course to the hand. It is placed nes be- beneath the flexor sublimis as low as two inches from the Ihltwo annular ligament, but it then becomes superficial along the Sef. outer border of the tendons of that muscle. Lastly the nerve dips beneath the annular ligament to enter the palm of the hand, where it is distributed.

This muscle and ends lies over the ulnar artery and nerve. After it has been skinl^ examined, it may be thrown inwards. The palmar fascia, or aponeurosis, consists of a central and two lateral parts; but the latter, which cover the muscles of the thumb and little finger, are so thin as not to require a separate notice. The central part is a strong, white, shining layer, which IS Its cen- pointed at the wrist; but is expanded towards the fingers, ^^"^^ where it covers nearly the width of the hand.

Dissection. — The radial artery comes into the palm of the Dissec- hand between the first two metacarpal bones ; and to lay it d'eep"^ bare, it will be requisite to detach the inner head of the ^'''^^"^ flexor brevis pollicis at the origin. The deep palmar arch, and the branch of the ulnar nerve that accompanies it, together with their offsets, are to be dissected out. A fascia, inter- which covers the interossei muscles, is to be removed, when muscles, the dissector has observed its connection with the transverse ligament uniting the heads of the metacarpal bones. Eadial Artery In the Hand.— The radial artery enters Radial the palm of the hand at the first interosseous space, between hand^ the heads of the abductor indicis muscle: and after fur- nishing one branch to the thumb, and another to the index finger, turns across the hand towards the ulnar side, and thus forms the deep palmar arch. The deep palmar arch extends from the interosseous forms space to the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, arch where it joins the communicating branch (profunda) of the ulnar artery. Its convexity, which is but slight, is directed which forwards, and its position is more posterior, or nearer the carpar"^ carpal bones, than that of the superficial arch. The arch has a deep position in the hand, and lies on the metacarpal bones and the interossei muscles ; it is covered by the long and be- flexor tendons, and in part by the inner head of the flexor anmus. brevis pollicis.

The distribution of these is the same as that of the arteries of the superficial arch. Digital ^ The digital branch of the index finger (art. radialis in- the fore dicis) is directed over the abductor indicis, and beneath the linger. ^ . short flexor and the adductor pollicis, to the radial side of the fore finger. At the free or anterior border of the ab- ductor indicis this branch is connected by an ofl'set with the superficial palmar arch ; and at the end of the finger it unites with the digital branch furnished to the opposite side bj the ulnar artery. Deep The deep branch of the ulnar nerve accompanies the deep of ulnar palmar arch of the radial artery as far as the muscles of the thumb, and terminates in branches to the adductor pollicis, the inner head of the short flexor, and the abductor indicis. Muscu- Branches,— Near its origin the nerve furnishes branches sets. " to the muscles of the little finger. In the palm it gives an offset to each palmar and dorsal interosseous muscle, and to each of the two inner lumbrical muscles, besides the terminal branches to the muscles before mentioned. Liga- The transverse metacarpal ligament connects together the head of heads of the metacarpal bones. Its cutaneous surface is ])ai hollowed where the flexor tendons cross it; and beneath it bones, the interossei muscles pass to their insertion. To the pos- terior border the fascia that covers the interossei muscles is united. This ligament should be taken away to see the interossei muscles. Seven The INTEROSSEI MUSCLES are SO named from their position between the metacarpal bones, and are seven in number.

The palmar muscles are three in number, and are smaller Number ^ and oi 1- than the dorsal set, although they are most prominent in the ^/JJ^^^j. palm of the hand. Undivided at the posterior part, they arise from the palmar surface of the metacarpal bones of the fingers on which they act, viz. those of the fore, ring, and little fingers ; and are inserted into the ulnar side of the fore, and the radial side of the other two digits (supposing the hand supine): their attachments may be kept in mind by attach- considering them adductors oi the fingers beiore mentioned to the middle line of the second. The dorsal interossei extend farther back than the palmar Dorsal set, and arise by a double head from the lateral surfaces of the two metacarpal bones between which they lie. The dorsal muscles are thus allotted to the digits :— two belong Number, to the middle finger, one is connected with the radial side of Attach- the fore, and one with the ulnar side of the ring finger. They may be considered abductors from the middle line of the second finger : thus the two muscles attached to the fore and ring fingers will draw those digits from the middle one ; and ac- and those that are connected with the middle finger will carry this to the right and left of a line passing through its centre. The first muscle of this set is noticed separately below, under the name abductor indicis.

To define the ligament the small muscles of the thumb and little finger must be taken from it. Before reading the description of this structure, the ends of the cut ligament should be placed in apposition. Annular The anterior annular liqament is a firm ligamentous band ligament ^ ^ ^ of front that arches over and binds down the flexor tendons of the of wnst. fingers. It is attached externally to the front of the os scaphoides, and to the fore and inner part, as well as the ridge of the os trapezium; and internally to the unciform and pisiform bones. By its upper border it is connected with the aponeurosis of the forearm, and by its anterior surface with the palmar fascia.

If the integument has not been taken from the fingers, let the dissector proceed to remove it, in order that the tendons may be traced to the ends of the fingers. The several muscles should be separated from one another up to their origin, especially the two radial ex- tensors of the wrist. The posterior annular ligament consists of the special Annular aponeurosis of the limb, thickened by the addition of some blhilid"*^ transverse fibres, and is situate opposite the lower ends of wrist, the bones of the forearm. This ligamentous band is con- nected at the outer part to the radius, and at the inner to the cuneiform and pisiform bones. It confines the extensor tendons, sending downwards processes, which are fixed to the bones, and form sheaths for those tendons. The liga- ment will be subsequently examined more in detail. Muscles of the back of the forearm, — The muscles Two are arranged in a superficial and a deep layer, like those of muscled the front of the forearm. The superficial layer is composed sunerfi- of seven muscles, which arise mostly by a common tendon seven''^ from the outer condyle of the humerus; and have the under- J?!".'''^^^' mentioned position one to another. Proceeding from without inwards, the student willfind in succession the long supinator, two radial extensors of the wrist (long and short), the common extensor of the fingers, the extensor of the little finger, and lastly the ulnar extensor of the wrist. There is one other small muscle near the elbow, the anconeus. The SUPINATOR RADII LONGUS is Contained partly in the supi- arm and partly in the forearm, and limits, on the outer side, longus the hollow in front of the elbow. The muscle arises from arises the upper two thirds of the outer condyloid ridge of the hu- hu-"" merus, and from the front of the external intermuscular septum. The fleshy fibres end above the middle of the fore- arm in a tendon, by means of which the muscle is inserted and is ^ into the lower end of the radius above the styloid process.

Escaping from the ligament, the most internal tendon divides into two, and all arm.EXTENSORS OF THE FINGERS. 323 four are directed along the back of the hand to their insertion into the last two phalanges of the fingers. On the back of the finders the tendons have the followinsr inser- disposition : — Opposite the first two phalangeal articula- the tcn- tions each tendon sends down lateral bands to join the cap- into the sule of the joint; and on the dorsum of the first phalanx it langes. forms an expansion with the tendons of the lumbricales and interossei muscles. At the anterior part of the first pha- lanx this tendinous expansion is divided into three parts: — the central one is fixed into the base of the second phalanx, whilst the lateral pieces unite at the front of the same pha- lanx, and are inserted into the last. On the fore and little fingers the expansion is joined bj the special tendons of those digits. This muscle is placed between the extensors of the wrist Conner- and little finger, and conceals the deep extensors. The the mus- tendon of the ring finger is united by an oblique band with each collateral tendon, so as to prevent the raising of that finger if the other fingers are closed.

Dissec- Dissection, — For the display of the deep muscles of the deep back of the forearm, and the posterior interosseous artery muscles and nerve, some of the superficial muscles, viz. the extensor communis, extensor minimi digiti, and extensor carpi ulnaris must be detached from their origin, and turned aside: some small branches of the nerve and artery, which will be seen entering the muscles, may be divided. The loose tissue and fat are then to be removed from the muscles, and from the and in- ramificatious of the artery and nerve ; and a slender part of seous the nerve, that sinks beneath one muscle (extensor of the and second phalanx of the thumb), about the middle of the fore- arm, should be carefully dissected.

The highest muscle, that partly surrounds the upper end of the radius, is the supinator brevis.

It arises from the posterior surface of the radius, for about three inches below the supi- nator brevis; from a special impression of the ulna for about the same distance, on the upper and inner part of the posterior surface; and from the intervening interosseous membrane. The tendon of the muscle is directed outwards over the radial extensors of the wrist, and through the outer inser- compartmcut in the annular ligament, to be inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb.

After those muscles have been divided, its fibres are to be followed forwards to their insertion into the radius; and that part of the origin of the flexor profundus digitorum, which lies on the outer side of the insertion of the brachialis anticus, is to be removed. Origin ^ The SUPINATOR BREVIS ariscs from the orbicular ligament supina- of the radius and the external lateral ligament of the elbow joint; from a depression below the small sigmoid cavity of the ulna; and from the external margin of the ulna below that depression for about two inches.

The fibres diverge as they descend, and are inserted in this way: — The anterior which are the ^^If^^ strongest, are fixed to the inner edge of the coronoid pro- cess; the posterior are attached to the inner side of the olecranon; whilst the middle fibres join a transverse liga- mentous band over the notch between the olecranon and the ^ notch on mner coronoid process.

Dissec- Dissection, — Open the joint by an incision across the front, near the humerus, and disarticulate the bones, in order that the form of the articular surfaces may be seen. Synovial The synoviol membrane lines the joint, and can be traced S^a^e. from one bone to another along the inner surface of the con- necting ligaments. It projects between the radius and the orbicular ligament, and serves for the articulation of the head of that bone with the small sigmoid cavity of the ulna.

A slightly raised line extends from front to back through the cavity, which is received into the hollow of the trochlea of the humerus in the motions of the joint. In the bottom of the cavity the cartilage is wanting completely, or for a greater or smaller distance across the articular hollow. End of The end of the radius presents a circular depression with331 LIGAMENTS OF RADIUS AND ULNA. a raised margin. In the bent state of the joint the depres- the sion of the radius is fitted on the eminence of the humerus, and the bone is thus supported during rotation of the limb. Union of the Radius and Ulna. — The radius is con- Radius nected with the ulna, at both the upper and lower ends, by to uina. means of distinct ligaments and a synovial membrane; and the shafts of the bones are further united by an interosseous ligament. Upper radio-ulnar articulation. — In this joint the head At the of the radius is received into the small sigmoid cavity of the end b^y ulna, and is kept in place by the following ligamentous band: — The annular or orbicular ligament is a strong fasciculus orbicu- . . . lar liga- of fibres, about a quarter of an inch wide, which is placed ment around the prominence of the head of the radius, and is attached to the anterior and posterior edges of the small sigmoid cavity of the ulna. Its upper border is connected ^J^^^^ ^ with the ligaments of the elbow joint; but the lower is free? of the and is applied around the neck of the radius. The radius moves freely in the socket formed by the ligament and the cavity of the ulna.

The membrane gives attachment to the deep muscles. Most of its fibres are directed obliquely inwards towards the ulna, though a few on the posterior surface have an opposite direction. ThQ round ligament is a slender band above the inter-By oundDISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. 832 osseous membrane, whose fibres have a direction opposite to those of the membrane. Bj one end it is fixed to the front of the coronoid process, and by the other it is inserted into the radius below the tubercle. This ligament divides the space above the interosseous membrane into two parts. Oftentimes this band is not to be recognised. The lower radio-ulnar articulation cannot be well seen till after the examination of the wrist joint. Dissection. — To see the ligaments of the wrist joint, the tendons and the annular ligaments must be removed from both the front and back; and the fibrous structures and the small vessels must be cleaned away carefully from the surface of the ligaments. The Wrist Joint. — The lower end of the radius and forming wrist the first row of the carpal bones enter into the wrist joint; and four ligaments maintain in contact the osseous surfaces, united viz. autcrior and posterior, and two lateral. The ulna is shut out from this articulation by means of a piece of fibro- cartilage. ext^ernai The external lateral ligament is a short and strong band, that intervenes between the styloid process of the radius and the upper part of the scaphoid bone. internal The internal lateral ligament is smaller than the external, but is longer than it. It is attached by one end to the sty- loid process of the ulna, and by the other to the rough, upper part of the cuneiform bone. Some of the anterior fibres are continued to the pisiform bone. anterior The anterior ligament takes origin from the end of the radius, and is inserted into the first row of carpal bones at the anterior surface, except the os pisiforme. poste- The posterior ligament is membranous, like the anterior, ment.^^ and its fibres are directed downwards and inwards. Supe- riorly it is attached to the lower end of the radius, and in- feriorly it is fixed, after the manner of the anterior ligament, to the first row of carpal bones on the posterior aspect. Dissec- Dissection. — To see the form of the articulating surfaces, the joint may be opened by a transverse incision through the posterior ligament, near the bones of the carpus.

Its mar- ^nd con- , , ^ ^ ^ nections. gins are united with the contiguous anterior and posterior ligaments of the wrist joint; and its surfaces enter into the construction of different joints, viz. those of the wrist and lower radio-ulnar articulation. Occasionally it is perforated by an aperture. The synovial membrane (membrana sacciformis) is very synovial loose, from which circumstance it has received its name, and brl^e. ^ascends between the radius and the ulna: it is separated from that of the wrist joint by the triangular fibro-car- tilage.

Bones Union OF THE Carpal Bones. — The scvcral bones of the fohied carpus are united into two rows by dorsal, palmar and inter- rows!^° osseous bauds; and the two rows are connected one to ano- ther by separate ligaments. How Bones of the first row, — The os semilunare is united first . . row is to the contififuous bones, viz. the scaphoid and cuneiform, formed. , , , , , by a dorsal and a palmar transverse band, as well as by an interosseous ligament at the upper part of the contiguous Separate surfaccs.

Second The bones of the second row are connected together in the like first, same way as those of the first row, viz. by a dorsal and a palmar band of fibres from one bone to another. Between the contiguous rough surfaces of the several bones are inter- osseous ligaments, one to each interval. The two One row with another,— The two rows of carpal bones joinedby are Connected by an anterior and posterior, and two lateral ligaments. anterior, The anterior ligament consists of irregular fibres, and intervenes between the two rows on the palmar aspect. The ?jo?^" posterior ligament, which is longer and looser, and the greater number of whose fibres are transverse, has a corresponding and attachment on the dorsal aspect of the bones. Of the lateral lateral ^ ^ liga- liqaments, the external is the best marked, and extends be- ments. . tween the os trapezium and the scaphoid bone ; whilst the internal ligament passes between the cuneiform and unciform bones. Dissec- Dissection, — After the division of the lateral and pos- terior ligaments, the one row of bones may be separated from the other, so as to allow the articular surfaces to be seen. Surface Articular surfaces. — The first row of carpal bones forms of each row in an arch, whose hollow is turned towards the other. In the contact. 1 • r» second row, the os magnum and os unciforme present a con- dyloid projection, which is received into the arch before mentioned: whilst the two outer bones are much below theLIGAMENTS OF THE HAND. 335 level of the others, and form a slight hollow for the reception of the outer part of the scaphoid bone. One synovial membrane serves for the articulation of all One sy. ^ , novial the carpal bones, except that of the pisiform with ^^^'"^ ^^j. cuneiform bone. Serving for the joint between the two rows aii the carpal of the carpus, the membrane sends upwards and downwards bones, prolongations between the individual bones. The offsets upwards are two, and they sometimes join the synovial mem- brane of the wrist joint; but the offsets in the opposite di- ^^tlT"^ rection are three, and may be continued to all, or only some meta- of the articulations between the four inner metacarpal with their carpal bones. Union of the Metacarpal Bones. — The metacarpal Meta- carpal bones of the four finsrers are connected at their bases by the bones are c\ .1 7 7 joined by following ligaments : — Superficial dorsal and palmar fasci- t^heir culi of fibres pass transversely from one bone to that next it; and those in the palm are the strongest. Besides, there are short interosseous bands between the contiguous rough surfaces of the bones. At their anterior extremities the metacarpal bones are and by bound together by the transverse ligament, which has been heads, examined in the dissection of the hand (p. 318.). Union between the Metacarpal and Carpal Bones. Joint — Most of the metacarpal bones of the fingers are articulated carpal with the carpal bones after one plan. The bone of the taca^pai thumb has a separate joint with a synovial membrane. a. The metacarpal bone of the thumb articulates with the that of OS trapezium ; and the ends of the bones are encased in a thumb; separate capsular ligament. The joint is supplied with a synovial membrane, which is simple in its arrangement. b. The metacarpal bones of the fingers receive longitu-those of dinal bands from the carpal bones on both aspects, thus : — fingers The dorsal ligaments are two to each of the four, except through that of the little finger. The bands to the metacarpal bone of the fore finger come from the os trapezium and os trape- zoides ; those to the third bone are from the os magnum and os trapezoides ; those to the bone of the ring finger from the OS magnum and os unciforme ; and to the fifth metacarpal bone there is but one band from the unciform bone. The and "palmar ligaments are weaker and less constant than the dor- bands sal. There is one to each metacarpal bone, except that of336 DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. the little finger : they may be oblique in direction ; and a band may be divided between two bones, as in the case of the ligament that is attached to the os trapezium and the second and third metacarpals. Sometimes one or more may be wanting. Lateral On the uluar side of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger is a longitudinal or lateral band, which is attached above to the os magnum and os unciforme, and below to the rough ulnar side of the base of the above-mentioned meta- carpal bone. Sometimes this band isolates the articulation of the last two metacarpals with the unciform bone from the remaining carpo-metacarpal joint; but more frequently it is divided into two parts, and does not form a complete partition between those joints. How This band may be seen by opening the articulation be- tween the unciform and the last two metacarpal bones; and then cutting through, with care, the transverse ligaments joining the third and fourth bones, so as to allow the separa- tion of the fourth from the third metacarpal. Dissec- Dissection. — The articulating surfaces of the bones in the carpo-metacarpal articulation may be seen by cutting through the rest of the ligaments on the posterior aspect of the hand. Surface Articular surfaces, — The metacarpal bone of the fore- ends of finger presents a hollowed articular surface, which receives bones, the prominence of the os trapezoides, and articulates late- rally with the OS trapezium and os magnum. That of the middle finger articulates with the os magnum. But the metacarpal bones of the ring and little finger are opposed to the unciform bone, and do not reach so far back as the other two. Synovial Synovial membranes. — Usually two synovial membranes two are interposed between the carpal and metacarpal bones, viz. a separate one for the bone of the thumb, and ofisets of the or three, common Carpal synovial sac (p. 335.) for the others. Some- times there is a distinct sac for the articulation of the osun- ciforme with its metacarpals.

Dissection. — For the examination of the ioint between the Di^sec- tion of head of the metacarpal bone and the first phalanx of the finger joints. finger, it will be requisite that the tendons and the tendinous expansion around it should be cleared away. A lateral ligament on each side, and an inferior thick band are to be defined. Another joint may be opened to see the articular surfaces. The same dissection may be made for the articulations between the phalanges of the finger. Union between the Metacarpal Bones and the First Meta- Phalanges.—In these joints the convex head of the meta- bones carpal bone is received into the glenoid fossa of the phalanx, pha- langes. and the two are retained in contact by the extensor and flexor tendons, and the following ligaments: — The lateral ligaments are the same on both sides of the Lateral joint.

The inferior Inferior ligament is a longitudinal band, which is fixed firmly to the mem. phalanx, but loosely to the metacarpal bone. It is fibro- cartilaginous in texture, and is grooved for the flexor ten- don : to its sides the lateral ligaments are attached.

The inferior inferior ligament has the same mode of attachment between ment. the extremities of the bones as in the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, but it is not so strong as in that articulation. There is a simple synovial membrane present in the joint. The articulation of the second with the last phalanx is like the preceding joint, both in the number and disposition of its ligaments, and in the surfaces of the bones ; but all the articular parts are much less strongly marked. Surface Articular Surfaces. — The anterior end of each phalanx of the ^ n bones, is marked by a pulley-like surface. The posterior end of the phalanx presents a transversely hollowed fossa, and is pro- vided with a crest which fits into the central depression of the opposite articular surface in the movements of the joint.CHIEF ARTERIES OF THE URRER LIMB. 339 z 2 TABLE OF THE CHIEF ARTERIES OF THE UPPER LIMB. ..

The cavity of the thorax is the space included hj the spinal J?^^"^- column, the ribs, and the sternum, and by certain muscles that close the intervals between the pieces of the bony frame- work. In it the organs of respiration, and the heart with its J^^^- great vessels are lodged ; and through it the gullet, and some nerves and vessels are transmitted. Dissection.— When the parts that cover in front the bony Dissec. parietes of the thorax have been examined and taken away, open T , . ft , . thorax. the cavity is to be opened by removing a part oi the anterior boundary. To make a sufficient opening into the thorax, the sternum is to be sawn through opposite the interval between the first two ribs, and again between the insertion of the cartilages of the fifth and sixth ribs. Aftery detach- ing the lining membrane (pleura) from the inner surface of the chest, the student is to cut through all the true ribs except the first and seventh *, as far back as he can con- veniently reach. The loose sternum and the ribs can be re- moved, by dividing the intercostal muscles in the first and sixth spaces. The internal mammary artery may now be cut across, and the bag of the pleura opened: when this has been done, the cavity with its contents will be ready for ex- amination. The sternum and the cartilages of the ribs will be required ^^^^^^J^"^ hereafter for the dissection of the ligaments. kept.

The level of this attached part will correspond to an oblique line over the side of the chest from the xiphoid cartilage to the eleventh rib; but it differs slightly on the two sides, being rather lower on the left, reaches apcx is Continued higher than the osseous part of the i"to wall, and reaches into the root of the neck.

Each point is bifid, proiects between the scaleni muscles, and touches the sub - how . ^ . bounded. clavian bloodvessels. In the interval between the apices are the several parts that pass between the neck and the thorax. Dimensions.—The hollow of the thoracic cavity does not size of chest not correspond to the visible size of the thorax ; for about the that of . . cavity ; lower half of the space included by the ribs is occupied by the abdominal viscera, and, above, it reaches beyond the ribs into the neck. In consequence of the arched condition of the diaphragm depth the depth of the space must vary greatly at difierent points. At the centre, where the depth is least, it measures about before; seven inches, but at the back as much again; and the other behind; vertical measurements can be estimated by means of the data on sides, given with respect to the correspondence of the base to parts of the wall of the thorax. Alterations in capacity,— The size of the thoracic cavity size is altered is constantly varying during life with the condition of the in life; ribs and the diaphragm in breathing. It is increased in the horizontal measurements in inspira- in trans- ^ verse tion, when the ribs are raised and separated from one dimen- . . . sions by another; and is diminished in expiration as the ribs approach "bs; one another, and the sternum sinks. An alteration in depth is due to the condition of the dia- in depth phragm in respiration ; for the muscle descends when air is dL-^*^ taken into the lungs, thus increasing the cavity; and ascends p*^^*^^^"' when the air is expelled from those organs, so as to restore the previous size of the space, or in violent efforts to dimi- nish it. But the movement of the diaphragm is not equal but un- throughout, and some parts of the cavity will be increased proportionally more than others. For instance the central tendinous piece is joined to the heart case, and moves but slightly; but the lateral, bulging,fleshy halves descend freely, and add greatly to the size of the lateral part of the chest by their separation from the thoracic parietes. It is evident that the thoracic cavity may be diminished thorax , ./ ./ lessened by the base being pushed upwards by enlargement, either addu temporary or permanent, of the viscera in the upper part of abdo.844 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. the abdomen; or by the existence of fluid in the latter cavity. THE PLEURA. Sac of The pleurse are two serous membranes, or closed sacs, pleura, wliich are reflected around the lungs in the cavity of the thorax. One occupies the right, and the other the left half of the cavity ; each is restricted to its own side, but it approaches its fellow along the middle line of the body, forming a thoracic partition, though the two do not com- municate.

From the front of the root of the lung, the pleura may be seen to course over the side of the pericardium to the sternum. If the serous sac be traced above the root of the lung, it will be found to describe a circle without deflection over the viscus.

In front of the heart and behind it, however, the contiguous strata of the mediastinum may be distinctly seen near one another; and to these portions the terms "anterior and posterior mediastina" are sometimes applied, but it should not be forgotten that they are only parts of one great mediastinum or septum reaching from the sternum to the spine.

Number The lungs are two in number, and are contained in the cavity of the thorax, one on each side of the spinal column, and use. In these organs the blood is changed in respiration. Form. The lung is of a somewhat conical form, corresponding to the shape of the half of the chest in which it is lodged, and is unattached on all sides, except at the inner part where the vessels enter and form its root. It is covered, as before said, by the bag of the pleura, except at the root. From the irregularity of its shape, it presents for examination a base and apex, two borders, and two surfaces; it is also divided into lobes by fissures, and has a root composed of the vessels and nerves entering its inner surface. Base The base of the lung is hollowed, and fits on the convexity dia- of the diaphragm; at its circumference is a thinned part, phragm. ^^^^ projects into the narrow space between that muscle and Shape the thoracic wall. Following the shape of that muscle, it is level, sloped obliquely from before backwards, and in consequence reaches much lower at the posterior than at the anterior edge. Its position with respect to the wall of the thorax may be ascertained externally by taking the levels of the diaphragm as guides (p. 342.); and it must be remembered that the lung will be a rib's breadth lower in front on the Apex is left, than on the right side. The apex is rounded, and neck.^ projects an inch to an inch and a half above the first rib, where it lies beneath the clavicle, the anterior scalenus muscle, and the subclavian artery.

Two fissures are seen in this border of the right lung, but only one in that of the left lung. The posterior border is as long again as the Poste- anterior, and projects inferiorly between the lower ribs and CThfckf the diaphragm ; it is thick and vertical, and is received into the hollow by the side of the spinal column. On the outer aspect the lung is convex, and is in contact External with the wall of the thorax. A large cleft divides this sur- face into two pieces (lobes of the lung), and on the right side there is a second smaller fissure. The inner surface is internal surface flat when compared with the outer, and is marked by the following inequalities: — Altogether in front, is the hollow corresponding to the heart and its large vessels, which is greatest on the left lung ; behind this, but nearer the pos- gives at- terior than the anterior border, is a fissure about three ment to inches long (hilum pulmonis), which receives the vessels forming the root of the lung. Each lung is divided incompletely into two parts or lobes Division by an oblique fissure, which begins near the apex, and ends lobes. in the anterior border near the base. From the form of the Left has lung and the direction of the fissure, the lower lobe is neces- sarily the largest. In the right lung 'a second horizontal and the fissure is directed forwards, from the middle of the oblique tifree one, to the anterior border, and cuts off a small triangular piece from the upper lobe: this is the third lobe of that lung. Occasionally there may be a trace of the third lobe in the left lung. Besides the difference in the number of the lobes, the Differ- right lung is larger and heavier, and is wider and more hoi- form ^" lowed out at the base than the left; it is also shorter by an of tiie^^ inch. The increased length and the narrowness of the left lung are due to the absence below of a large projecting body like the liver, and to the direction of the heart to the left more than to the right side. Root of the lung, — The vessels of the lung entering the Root of fissure on the inner surface are bound together by the pleura and some connective tissue; they form a foot-stalk or the root, which fixes the lung to the heart and the windpipe.DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 348 situa- The root is situate at the inner surface, about midway be- tween the base and apex, and about a third of the breadth of Connec- that surface from the posterior border of the lung. In front tions. root, on both sides, are the phrenic nerve and the anterior pulmonic nerves, the former being at some little distance from it; and anterior to the right root is the descending cava. Behind, on both sides, is the posterior pulmonic plexus; and on the left side there is, in addition, the descending aorta. Above, on the right side, is the vena azygos, and on the left side the arch of the aorta. Below each root is the fold of pleura called ligamentum latum pulmonis. Consti- In the root of the lung are found the vessels connected tuents of ^ ... theroot jwith the fuuctiou of respiration, viz. a division of the air tube (bronchus), a branch of the pulmonary artery, and two pub^nary veins; together with small nutritive bronchial arteries and veins, and some nerves and lymphatics. These different bodies have the following position to one an- other : — their Qn both sidcs the bronchus is most posterior, the pul- relative , x ^ x position, monary veins most anterior, and the pulmonary artery between the other two. In the direction from above down- wards the position on the right side is, bronchus, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary veins ; but on the left side there is a slight difference, owing to the bronchus and artery having changed places ; consequently the relative position will there be, artery, bronchus, and veins. This difference in the two sides may be accounted for by the fact of the left branch of the air tube being at a lower level than the right one. THE PERICARDIUM. Situa- The bag that contains the heart is named the pericardium. It is situate in the middle of the thorax, in the interval be- tween the pleurae of opposite sides. Before proceeding with the anatomy of this sac, the following dissection should be undertaken : — Clean Dissection.— Supposing the surface of the pericardium to vessels of heart bc already cleaned, the student should next dissect out the and seek . , . n • i tt small large arteries and veins connected with the heart.

Betv^reen the preceding, and close to tho coats of the artery, are the two following small nerves, the left superficial cardiac nerve of the sympathetic, and the cardiac branch of the left vagus ; of the two, the last is the smallest, and to the right of the other. The two cardiac nerves from the left vasrus and the sym- Dissect puperti- pathetic are to be followed onwards to a small plexus (super- ciai ficial cardiac) in the concavity of the aorta. An offset of the in arcii • 1 1 T 1 1 1 1 of aorta. plexus IS to be traced downwards between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, towards the anterior coronary artery of the heart; and another prolongation is to be found coming forwards by the side of the arterial duct, from the deep cardiac plexus, to join the superficial one. When the peri- cardium is opened, the nerves will be followed on the heart, but their dissection is difficult, and will require some care. Oftentimes these small nerves are destroyed in inject- ing the body. The pericardium is larger than the viscus it contains. Connect Occupying the interpleural space, it is situate behind the the'peri- sternum, and projects below on each side of that bone, but much more towards the left than the right side. Some- what conical in form, the wider part of the bag is turned towards the diaphragm, and the narrower part upwards towards the large vessels of the heart. Laterally, the peri- cardium is covered by the pleura, and the phrenic nerve and vessels lie in contact with it. Its anterior and posterior surfaces correspond to the objects contained in the fore and hinder part of the interpleural space; and on the anterior aspect the bag is partly covered by the margins of the lungs, especially the left, in the manner stated. This envelope of Fibro- the heart consists of a fibrous structure, which is lined m- case, ternally by a serous membrane. The fibrous part surrounds the heart entirely, and is Fibrous pierced by the different vessels entering that organ. ItgfvL gives prolongations around the vessels that pass through it, to ves- and the strongest of these sheaths is that on the aorta. In- feriorly it is united by fibres to the central tendon of the joins diaphragm; but on the left side it extends beyond the limit phragm350 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. of that tendon, and reaches the fleshy fibres. This membrane is thickest at the upper part, and is formed of fibres that cross in different directions, many being longitudinal. When the pericardium has been cut open, the serous lining will be discernible. The serous sac lines the interior of the fibrous pericar- dium, and is reflected over the surface of the heart. Like other serous membranes, the arachnoid for example, it has a parietal and a visceral part. After lining the interior of the fibrous case, to v^hich it gives the shining appearance, the membrane is conducted to the surface of the heart by the different vessels. As it is reflected on the aorta and the pulmonary artery, it contains those vessels in one tube, not passing between their contiguous surfaces; and at the pos- terior part of the pericardium it forms a pouch between the pulmonary veins of opposite sides. The cavity of the serous sac is lubricated by a little fluid. The vessels of the pericardium are derived from the in- ternal mammary, the bronchial, the oesophageal, and the phrenic arteries. THE HEART AND ITS LARGE VESSELS. This The heart is a hollow muscular body, and is divided into body is four compartments by septa. It is the centre of the vas- circuia- cular systcm, and the agent in the propulsion of the blood through the body. Into it all veins enter, and from it the arteries issue. Form. Form, — When the heart is distended, its form is rather conical; and it lies in the chest with the wider part, or the base directed upwards and to the right, and the rounded apex forwards and to the left side of the cavity. It is sur- rather flattened from before backwards, and rounded on the faces and n ' ^ n nn borders, left Side, SO that the surfaces and borders have differences which serve to distinguish them one from another: — thus the anterior surface is slightly convex, whilst the posterior is nearly flat; the left border is thick and round, but the right is thin, sharp, and less firm.

Position and direction.— The heart lies beneath the lower situation two thirds of the sternum, and projects on each side of it, chesty but more on the left than the riarht side. The axis is not line of its axis parallel to that of the body, but is inclined obliquely across it; and its left margin is undermost, whilst the right is foremost. The heart has not a vertical direction in the chest, with placed almost the base upwards and the apex down, but almost a hori- horizou- zontal one, so that the base is directed backwards to the right, and the apex forwards to the left side. Limits. — The limits of the whole heart are the follow- Limits ing: — The base is opposite the spinal column, and corresponds of base to the interval between the fifth and the eighth dorsal ver- tebrae. The apex strikes the wall of the thorax during life and just below the fifth rib, near its junction with the cartilage, and at a spot on the surface, " two inches below the nipple and one on the sternal side " (Williams). The upper limit would be a line across the sternum on a of "pp^^" , margin, level with the upper border of the third costal cartilage. And the lower limit, a line across the sternum at the junc- tion of the xiphoid cartilage, from the articulations of the sixth and seventh cartilages of the right side to the spot where the apex touches. Its lateral limits are the following. On the right it pro- lower jects from one to one inch and a half beyond the middle line of the sternum, and its increase in this direction is con- stantly varying with the degree of distension of the right half of the heart. On the left side the heart projects three inches to three inches and a half from the centre of the sternum. Position to wall. — In consequence of the direction of the oniy heart in the thorax, only some parts can be near, or in con- parts tact with the parietes in front: thus the base must be the waii. directed away from the sternum and the costal cartilages ; and the left half will be undermost and deep in the cavity, whilst the right half will be forwards and in contact largely with the anterior wall.* * If the dissector wishes for farther information respecting the cor-352 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. The Component parts.— The heart is a double organ, and is double, made up of two similar halves, right and left. In each half are two hollow portions, an auricle and a ventricle; these communicate, and are provided with vessels for the entrance each and exit of the blood. The ri2:ht half receives black blood half ° having by the systemic veins, and sends the same to the lungs ricie and by mcaus of the pulmonary artery ; but the left half is sup- tricie. plied with red blood from the lungs by the pulmonary veins, and distributes this over the body through the aorta. Grooves On the surface of the heart are certain grooves, indicatory position of this composition. Thus passing circularly round the heart, nearer the base than the apex, is a groove which cuts off, as it were, the thin auricular, from the fleshy ventricular auricles part. The auricular portion is placed at the base of the organ, and is subdivided into two halves (right and left) by and ven. a median partition. In like manner the ventricular portion tricles • is parted into right and left ventricles by a septum. The situation of the median partition between the ventricles is and par- recos^nised bv a longitudinal sulcus on the surface: this tition ° ^ , . ^ . - - between sulcus docs uot occupy the mid space either on the anterior or the posterior aspect, but is nearer the left border of the heart, in front, and the right border behind; so that most right of the anterior surface is formed by the right, and the f?ont.^" greater part of the posterior surface by the left ventricle. Number The auricles are two (right and left), as before said, and ation of are placed so deeply at the base of the heart, behind the aorta auricles, and the pulmonary artery, that only the tip of the right one comes forwards to the sternum. They receive their appella- tion from the resemblance that the tips or appendices, that project forwards on the sides of the arteries, bear to the Veins dog's cars. The auricles are much thinner than the ven- their tricles, and are recipients of blood from large veins. Of the Sght!^ two, the right is rather the larger and the more anterior ; it is joined by the upper and the lower cava, and by veins Left. from the substance of the heart. The left auricle receives the two pulmonary veins of each side.

The left ventricle enters alone The left, into the apex, the left border, and most of the posterior surface of the heart: with its cavity the aorta is connected. Dissection,—Before opening the heart, the vessels for the Dissect / . . coro- nutrition of its substance (coronary arteries) are to be dis- naryves- sels and sected on the surface, together with the small nerves and nerves, veins that accompany them. The two arteries appear on the sides of the pulmonary artery, and occupy the grooves on the surface of the heart, where they are surrounded by fat; one branches over the right, and the other over the left side. With the anterior artery is a plexus of nerves, which is to be followed upwards to the superficial cardiac plexus ; and with the remaining artery is another plexus. At the back of the heart, in the groove between the and co- ronary auricles and ventricles, the student will find the large coro- sinus, nary vein, and the dilated coronary sinus in which it ends: the last should be defined and followed to its ending in tho right auricle. The coronary arteries are two small vessels that are so Two named from their course around the heart: they are the of the heart first branches of the aorta, and arise close above the semi- viz. lunar valves. One is distributed on the right, and the other on the left side of the heart. a. The right coronary branch appears on the right side of right the pulmonary artery, and is directed onwards in the depres- nary", sion between the right auricle and ventricle to the posterior aspect of the heart, where it anastomoses with a similar circular offset from the left coronary artery. In this course branches are distributed upwards and downwards to the right half of the heart. Two of these are of larger size than the rest: — one runs on the anterior aspect of the right ven- tricle towards the free margin; the other descends on the back of the heart, along the septum between the ventricles.DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 854 and anastomoses towards the apex with the left coronary artery. left h. The left coronary branch is inclined behind the pul- artery?^ monary artery to the left side of that vessel, then in the groove between the left auricle and ventricle to the back of the heart, where it anastomoses with the right coronary branch. Like the preceding artery, it furnishes offsets to the substance of the auricle and ventricle.

About an inch usually in extent, it is limited on the one side by two valves that exist at the opening of the great coronary vein into it, and on the other by another valve (Thebesian), where it opens into the right struc- auricle. It is crossed by the muscular fibres of the left auricle. Inferiorly and on the right it receives some branches from the back of the ventricles, whose openings are guarded by valves; and nearly at its outer termination is another joining.

Cardiac nerves,— The nerves for the supply of the heart cardiae ^ *^ nerves. are derived from a large plexus (cardiac) around the roots of the aorta and the pulmonary artery. Part of this plexus is superficial to the pulmonary artery, and part beneath it; and from each an offset is sent with a coronary artery. Only the superficial part can be now seen. The small superficial cardiac plexus is placed by the side of the Super- . ductus arteriosus, and below the arch of the aorta. The nerves piexus that join it are the left superficial cardiac nerve of the sympa- thetic, the small (cervical) cardiac branch of the left vagus (p. 117.), and a considerable bundle of nerves that comes forwards to it from the deep cardiac plexus. A small ganglionic mass is some- times seen in the plexus. Inferiorly the plexus ends in nerves to ends in the heart, that accompany the right coronary artery. A few fila- coro- ments pass on the left division of the pulmonary artery to the front of the root of the lung of the same side. a. The anterior or right coronary plexus passes downwards from Anterior the plexus above described, to reach the right coronary artery, and SfTeart. receives near the heart a communicating offset from the right half of the deep cardiac plexus. h.

On and in the substance of the heart the nerves are marked by small ganglia.

Inferiorly the fossa merges into the opening of the lower cava. A thin semitransparent structure forms the bottom of the fossa, and there is oftentimes a small oblique aperture at its upper part.

Other small aper- tures are seen scattered over the surface: some lead only into depressions, but others are the mouths of the veins of the substance of the heart (venae cordis minimse), and are named foramina Thebesii. The chief apertures in the auricle are those of the two Aper- -t^ ^ tures of cavae, of the coronary vein, and of the ventricle; but the cavae. openings of the cavae should be specially noted, because they are so placed that the current of blood issuing from one, in the fetus, does not mix much with that from the other. The opening of the superior cava is in the front and top of the auricle, and its direction is downwards and somewhat forwards. The inferior cava enters the lowest part of the auricle near the septum, and is directed inwards and back- wards to the fossa ovalis. All those openings, except that of the superior cava, have Jfj^^l^ some kind of valve.

The placental or pure blood entering by the in- t^eiems. ferior cava, is directed by the Eustachian valve chiefly into the left auricle, through an opening (foramen ovale) in the septum ; whilst the current of systemic or impure blood, coming in by the superior cava, flows downwards in front of the other to the right ventricle.DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 358 To open DissectioTi. — Seizing the right ventricle, the student ventri- should pass the scalpel through it below the opening from the auricle, and cutting downwards bring it out inferiorly near the apex of the heart, without injuring the septum ventriculorum.

The central part of each segment is strong, whilst the points are thin and notched; and between the primary divisions there are sometimes secondary points (Kiirschner). The tendinous cords that keep the valve in attaeh- position ascend from the musculi papillares in the intervals tendi- between the pieces of the valve, and are connected with the cords, two segments between which they lie *: they end on the surface of the valve turned away from the opening, in three different ways ; some reaching the attached upper margin of the valve, others entering the central thickened part of the segment, and the rest, that are much finer, ending in the thin point of the tongue of the valve.

In the valves the fibrous tissue has a Arrange- spccial arrangement: — There is one band along the attached fibrous margin ; a second along the free margin, which is connected with the projecting nodule; and a third set of fibres is di- rected from the nodule across the valve, so as to leave a triangular or semilunar interval almost free from fibres be- tween it and the band in the free edge, which has been Their named lunula. The use of these little valves is obvious, viz. to give free passage to fluid in one direction, and to prevent its return by closing the area of the vessel. Whilst the blood is entering the artery, the valves are placed against the wall; but when the vessel acts on the contained blood, the valves are thrown towards the centre of the cavity, and arrest the return of the circulating fluid into the ventricle.

In its interior are three semilunar or sigmoid isguard- ^ ed by valves^ which are larger and stronger than the corresponding three^ ^ parts in the pulmonary artery, but have a like structure, valves, attachment, and function. The projection in the centre of each valve, viz. corpus s. nodulus Arantii, is also better marked. Opposite each valve the coat of the aorta is bulged as on the right side, though in a greater degree, and presents also a little hollow on the inner side named sinus of Valsalva. Above the free margin of two of the small valves are the apertures of the coronary arteries.

The apertures of tures: the arteries (aorta and pulmonary) are nearest the septum; and as the two vessels were originally formed from one tube, they are close together, but the pulmonary artery is the more anterior of the two. The aperture of communication with each auricle is next the circumference of the heart, and is posterior in its position to the artery that issues from the fore part of the ventricle. The position of the openings to one another, from before backwards, has been before referred from ' ' before to;—thus the right auriculo-ventricular is before the left; back, and the opening of the pulmonary artery is before that of the aorta, and rather higher than it.

Near the bifurcation of the artery is a for°the^ small ligaiqaeutous cord, the remnant of the arterial duct, which passes from the left branch of the vessel to the arch of the aorta, and is named ligamentum ductus arteriosi. connec- The truuk of the pulmonary artery is contained in the peri- cardium ; and beneath it is the beginning of the aorta, to- gether with the left auricle. On each side are the coronary artery and the auricula. Right The right branch is longer than the left. In its course to longest.'^ the lung it lies beneath the aorta and the vena cava supe- rior, and rests on the bronchus or the division of the air tube: and as it passes outwards, it is above the level of the right auricle of the heart. At the lung the artery divides into three primary branches, one for each lobe, which enter the pulmonic substance.

The AORTA is the great systemic vessel that conveys the This blood from the heart to the different parts of the body. The vessel extends vessel first arches backwards to reach the spinal column, on which it afterwards extends through the chest and the abdo- through men. In the thorax, the vessel is divided into two parts — and ab- arch of the aorta, and the descending or thoracic aorta. Arch of the aorta. — The aorta has its orio-in in the left its ^^st . . . part is ventricle, close below the junction of the cartilage of the arched, third rib of the left side with the sternum. From that point The ex- tent it ascends, curving backwards over the windpipe and the gullet, to reach the left side of the spinal column. And it loses its designation of " arch " at the lower border of the body of the third dorsal vertebra. The arch has its con- vexity upwards and to the right, and its concavity to the root of the left lung; and from it the large vessels for the supply of the upper part of the body take their origin. For and di- the purpose of reducing to order the numerous connections of the cf this portion of the aorta, the arch is divided into three parts — ascending, transverse, and descending.

From this part arise the three great vessels of the head and the upper limbs.

It lies against the third dorsal ver- tebra, and the fibro-cartilage between this and the second; and it is covered by the pleura of the left side of the chest. Parts In the concavity of the arch of the aorta are contained the con ined in left auriclc of the heart, the root of the left lung, the branch- ' ing of the pulmonary artery with its arterial duct, and the left recurrent nerve. Deeper than these bodies, will be found the oesophagus and the thoracic duct, with some lymphatic glands. Five The branches of the arch of the aorta are five in number; branches of the two come from the ascending, and three from the transverse two part. The first two are the coronary arteries of the heart, nary^ which havc bccu already noticed (p. 353.).

Lastly, there may be five or six trunks five, or from the arch; and in instances of this state, the internal and ex- ternal carotids take their origin from it, in consequence of absence of the trunk common to the two, on one or both sides. Occasional branches.— Some smaller or secondary arteries take Number origin occasionally from the arch. The most frequent example of by this peculiarity is seen in the origin of the left vertebral artery be- aiy^'^^^" tween the left carotid and subclavian trunks, or beyond them, ^gf"^"'^' Occasionally a thyroid artery (lowest thyroid), or the right internal mammary, or both vertebrals, will be seen to spring from the arch of the aorta.

Occasionally it arises in common with quent!" the left carotid when the arch has its usual direction. Should there be transposition of the arch, the subclavian arises usually from an innominate trunk ; but this is not a constant rule, for the subclavian, in such a condition of the vessels, may be the last on the arch, like the right vessel, and cross the front of the spinal column to take its place in the neck: or it may take origin, though rarely, from a dilatation connected with the remains of the arterial duct.

To reach the inner margin of the first rib of the right side, when it is last on the arch (most to the left), the artery is directed between the oesophagus and the ver- tebral column, or it may be, as in one case, between the trachea and the oesophagus. The right subclavian may be also connected with a pouch, — the previous part of the ductus arteriosus, in the same way as the left subclavian. (See the work of Mr. Quain, p. 159.)

Nerves The pncumo-gastric and the sympathetic nerves supply the thorax, visccra of the thorax. Some other nerves (intercostal) which are contained in the wall of the thorax, will be afterwards dissected. In the cavity of the thorax is the phrenic nerve, but this only courses through it to the diaphragm. To trace Dissectiou.— The phrenic nerve is sufficiently denuded for nerves, its examination ; but the student should trace the vagus far\y^^ ucrvc through the cavity of the thorax. The vagus is to be followed, on both sides, behind the root of the lung, and its large plexus in that position is to be dissected out: some filaments of the gangliated cord of the sympathetic, that come forwards to the plexus, must be looked for. In front of the root, the nerve supplies a few pulmonary filaments, especially on the left side. From the root of the lung the vagus is to be pursued along the oesophagus, by raising the lung and removing the pleura. Phrenic The PHRENIC NERVE (internal respiratory) is a muscular nerve is pi • x j / derived branch from the cervical plexus to the diaphragm (p. 78.). cervical In its coursc through the thorax, it lies alono: the side of the plexus, , . . pericardium, and at a little distance from the root of the and lung, with a small companion artery. When near the dia- through phragm each is divided into branches that perforate the to the fleshy fibres, and are distributed on the under surface. The phragm. ncrves of opposite sides differ in length, and in their con- nections above the root of the lung.PNEUMO-GASTRIC NERVE. 375 The right nerve is deeper at first in its position, and is Right also shorter and straighter than the left. As it enters the above chest the nerve crosses behind the subclavian vein, but in lung. front of the internal mammary artery; and it lies afterwards along the right side of the innominate vein and the superior cava till it comes in front of the root of the lung. The left nerve has the same position to vessels as the Left • • • T 1 • r> nerve risrht when entering the cavity, but it is directed m front of above ® ^ root: the arch of the aorta to the root of the lung; and, lower down, it makes a curve around the projecting heart. Before is longer reaching the arch of the aorta, the nerve is external to the right, left common carotid artery, and crosses the left vagus from without inwards, so as to be internal to that nerve on the arch. Branches. — Some small filaments are said to be furnished some from the nerve to the pleura and pericardium; and occasion- ally the nerve is joined, near the upper part, by a twig from the branch of the nerve to the subclavius muscle. Internal mammary artery. — A small part of this artery. Internal which furnishes a branch to the diaphragm, has not yet been malr" noticed. This part intervenes between the point of entrance ^^^^"^^ of the artery into the chest (p. 74.), and its course through the cavity along the side of the sternum (p. 266.). Lying winds beneath the first rib the vessel winds round the phrenic Ipe?ture nerve and the innominate vein to reach the side of the ' rax, sternum. It gives the following offset: — The superior phrenic branch (comes nervi phrenici) is a and very slender artery, that accompanies the phrenic nerve to phrenic the diaphragm, and is distributed to that muscle, anasto- mosing therein with the other arteries from the aorta, and with the musculo-phrenic branch of the internal mammary. The PNEUMO-GASTRic NERVE is One of the three trunks vagus constituting the eighth cranial nerve (p. 116.). Like the "n\he phrenic nerve, each passes through the thorax in its course cw^e?^ from the neck to the abdomen. In the lower part of the on^both thorax the nerves resemble one another in their course, for low root they pass behind the root of the lung, each on its own side, and along the oesophagus to the stomach. But above the root of the lung, the right and left nerves differ as much as the phrenic. Each supplies branches to the viscera, viz. to the heart, the lungs, and the gullet.DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 376 Right The right nerve is posterior to the left in its position. As vagus , , above the norve appears in the thorax, it lies between the sub- ofthe clavian artery and the right innominate vein, and sends backwards a recurrent branch round the former. At first it is directed obliquely backwards, over the side of the trachea, to the interval between that tube and the oesophagus; and thus supported, the nerve reaches the posterior aspect of the root of the lung, where it forms the posterior pulmonary and on plexus. From the plexus two laro^e offsets are continued to the back j. o of the the oesophagus, and unite into one near the diaphragm: the gmbe- trunk thus formed, lies behind the gullet, and passes along * i t to the posterior surface of the stomach. Left The left nerve enters the thorax behind the left innominate above vcin, and to the outer side of the left common carotid artery, of thr* Lying between the left subclavian and common carotid arteries, the nerve courses over the arch of the aorta, then beneath the root of the lung, and forms there a larger plexus and on than ou the right side. From the pulmonic plexus one or of the two branches pass to the front of the oesophagus, and join giis°^^^ with the corresponding branches of the right nerve in a plexus on that tube. Finally, the divisions of the nerve are collected into one trunk, which is continued on the front of the oesophagus to the anterior part of the stomach.

Pulmonary branches. — There are two sets of branches for the Puimon- lung, one to the anterior and the other to the posterior aspect of blanch- the root. a. The anterior branches are two or three in number, and of Small small size, and communicate with filaments of the sympathetic on the pulmonary artery. These nerves are best seen on the left side. h. The posterior branches are the largest and much the most Large numerous, and are obtained by the splitting of the trunk of the rior^ nerve after it has become flattened. Forming a plexiform arrange- form a ment (posterior pulmonary plexus) behind the root of the lung, these nerves are joined by filaments from the third and fourth ganglia of the knotted cord of the sympathetic, and are conveyed into the interior of the lung on the divisions of the air tube. 4.

By the removal of some fibrous and fatty tissues and lymphatic glands, the right part of the plexus, in which the cervical cardiac branches of the sym- pathetic and pneumo-gastric nerves of the right side are united, will be seen in front of the trachea, above the right branch of the pulmonary artery. The offsets to the heart should be followed downwards on the trunk of the pulmo- nary artery ; and those to the right lung should be traced along the branch of that artery. To ex- To lay bare the part of the plexus into which the cervical pose the '' ^ , left part, brauchcs of the sympathetic and vagus nerves of the left side of the body enter, the arch may be cut through a second time, to the left of the junction of the ligamentum arteriosum with it; and that ligament is to be divided, so as to allow the transverse part of the arch to be turned upwards with the great vessels attached to it.

THE TRACHEA AND THE LUNG. To see Dissection.— To see the bronchi, or the divisions of the the trachea air tuDe in the root of the lung, it will be necessary to divi- remove the pulmonary artery and its branches, together with sions, the pulmonary veins. When the transverse part of the arch of the aorta, which has been already cut through, is turned to one side, the dissector will be able to clear away the bronchial glands, the nerves, and the fibrous tissue from the part of the trachea in the thorax, and from the branches into which it bifurcates. Trachea The TRACHEA, or the air tube, reaches from the larynx to lies in the luno^s, and lies on the front of the spinal column.

Its con- In the thorax the trachea is situate, with the great vessels, in the in the space between the pleural bags. Here it is covered by the arch of the aorta, by the innominate and left carotid arteries, and by the cardiac plexus of nerves; and super- ficial to the last arteries is the left innominate vein. Behind the air tube is the oesophagus, which is slightly inclined to the left near the arch of the aorta. On the right side are the vagus, and the innominate artery for a short distance after this has passed over the trachea; and on the left side is the vagus with its recurrent branch. ;||||| Bronchi The broncM, or the divisions of the air tube, are con- roots of tained in the root of the lung, where they are surrounded lungs; by vessels, glands, and nerves. Near the lung each is divided into as many primary pieces as there are lobes to are like that orffan.

Dissection, — The luners are next to be removed from the Remove . the body in order that their physical characters and the structure lungs to 11 1 .11 1 1 1 examine may be learnt: they will be separate as soon as the vessels them, of the root are cut through. Next, the remains of the heart and pericardium are to be taken away. To effect their re- moval the inferior cava is to be divided, and the pericardium to be detached from the surface of the diaphragm; and in doing this, some care should be taken by the dissector not to injure the parts contained in the interpleural space in front of the spine. Physical Characters of the Lung. — The surface of surface the lung is smooth and shining, in consequence of its pleural smooth; investment. Through the serous covering the mass of the is mark- lung may be seen to be divided by septa, and by dark spots lobuies or sometimes lines, into small irregularly-sized pieces or lobules. On looking closely at the pulmonary substance, especially at a thin margin, the texture will be perceived to and be spongy, or composed of minute cells. cSL The tint of the lung varies with age. In infancy the colour colour is a pale red; but in the adult the texture becomes with" grayish in colour, and presents here and there dark gray spots or lines, whose colour deepens with increasing age, and becomes even black in old people.

Specific The specific gravity of the lung varies with the condi- tions of dilatation and collapse, or of infiltration with fluid. When the pulmonary tissue is free from fluid, and filled with air it floats in water; but when it is quite deprived of air it is slightly heavier than water, and sinks in that fluid. and The weight of the lung is influenced greatly by the quantity weight ... of the of fluid or other material contained in its texture; ordinarily it varies from eighteen to twenty-one ounces, and the right lung is about two ounces heavier than the left. In the male the lungs are larger, and slightly heavier than in the female. Follow Dissection,—By tracing the large branches of the bronchi, and ves- and the bloodvessels and nerves into the lung, the mode of the lung, branching of the air tubes will be apparent; and by in- flating a part of the lung, the cellular structure may be seen. But the arrangement of the air cells about their tube, and that of the different vessels cannot be ascertained without injections and a microscope. Outline Structure of the Lung. — The spongy pulmonary elements structuro cousists of minutc cells, in which the smallest lung, branches of the air tube terminate ; and the mass of the lung is formed by the collection of those cells into small groups or lobules, and by the aggregation of these into larger masses or lobes. Each lobule is distinct from the surrounding ones, and is furnished with its air tube and nerves, and with its own set of vessels concerned in both its function and nutrition. The constituents of the lung are united by a serous covering, which is prolonged con- tinuously over the surface, and by a subserous layer of con- nective tissue which penetrates into the interior, subdividing383 STRUCTURE OF THE LUNG. it into pieces. These several parts are examined more in detail below. Serous and subserous coverings. — The coat derived from serous and the pleura is thin and transparent, and forms an entire cap- sule for the lung, except at the root, where the vessels enter. The subserous layer contains fibres of elastic tissue, and not subse- only covers the surface, but extends inwards, establishing cover- the division of the mass into lobules: where it separates the lobules it is named interlobular connective tissue, and is there free from fat. Bronchial branches in the lung. — When a bronchus is pivi- followed into the pulmonary structure, it is found to divide of the generally in a binary order, and to diminish in size at each in the subdivision, until one terminal offset appertains to a lobule. In the lobule, the tube has a diameter of -^^ to 3^ of an inch. When this last degree of diminution is arrived at, tiu they the tubes give origin to the air cells. ceiis. The larger bronchial branches have the same constituent Differ- ^ ence in parts as the trachea, only these are somewhat differently ^^^^^^"^ arranged ; and they are round in the lung, instead of being tu^jis in hemispherical as in the trachea. The smallest branches, and ti^re the air cells, want some of the common structures; and those form" from, which the cells spring are irregular in shape, appearing to be spaces amongst the cells rather than tubes with con- tinuous walls.

The fibrous and elastic tissues of Fibrous and elas- the bronchial tubes are continued even to the air cells; but <^ic tis- sue. in the small cell-bearing branches, the bundles of elastic tissue are diffused, and the two textures, much diminished in strength, are blended together to form the parietal struc- ture.

The mem- , . brane. mucous membrane becomes thinner as it extends onwards along the air tube, and is finally continued to the cells, where it is transparent. Its ciliated columnar epithelium is changed for nucleated scaly or pavemental in the air cells. Lobules, Lobules and lobes.— A lobule is a cluster of air cells formed, arourud a terminal branch of the air tube. Varying in size and shape, the lobule is invested by connective tissue, and possesses its own offset of the air tube, as well as distinct Lobes, branches of vessels and nerves. The larger masses of the lung, viz. lobes, are produced by the aggregation of the lobules. Nature The air cells are the little sacs or dilatations in which the of the air smallest branches of the air tube terminate. They are poly- hedral in form, except on the surface, and are distinct one from another, save through the channel of the air passage, position The cells are clustered in groups around the terminal divi- on air ^ ^ tubes, sion of the air tube, and are situate both along the sides and at the extremity of the passage, with which they com- size. municate by large orifices. In size, these small cells vary from -^i^ to y^^th of an inch across, but they are larger on the surface and at the edges than in the deeper parts of the struc- lunsc. The cell wall is formed by fibrous tissue, with some ture. ^ , o 1 -, scattered fibres of elastic tissue, and is lined by a trans- parent mucous membrane possessing scaly epithelium.* Beneath the mucous lining is a network of the pulmonary vessels. Vessels Vessels of the lung.— Two sets of vessels are furnished to fung are the lung, onc being concerned in its function, the other in tio"nai its uutrition. The vessels that convey blood to the lung to nutrient, be aerated, or that carry the same away after it has been subjected to the respiratory process, are named pulmonary; whilst the vessels connected with the nutrition of the struc- ture are called bronchial, puirao- «. The pulmonary artery after entering the lung, divides hke the artery bronchus which it accompanies to the lobule. At the lobule the arterial branch is minutely subdivided, and its ramifications, enter- ing the interlobular fissures, end in a capillary network in the * Some excellent observers deny the existence of an epithelial mucous lining to the cells.385 VESSELS OF THE LUNG. wall of the air cells, beneath the mucous lining. The vascular circle around one cell communicates with the contiguous ones. The pnlmonary veins begin in the vascular network before men- andvein; tioned, and the twigs issuing from the several lobules are united in larger tubes, which course to the root of the lung. Although the small lobular branches of the arteries remain separate from one another, the corresponding veins anastomose together. h.

PARTS IN FRONT OF THE SPINE AND THE CORD OF THE SYMPATHETIC. In front of the spinal column are the several parts enu- merated as lying in the interpleural space of the posterior half of the mediastinum, viz. the aorta, azygos veins, thoracic duct, and oesophagus. Dissection.—The small thoracic duct should be first found Disscc- near the diaphragm, and on the right of the aorta: this tiiTp^arts slender vessel may be injected with tallow. Next, the con- men- nective tissue is to be cleared away from the different parts before mentioned, and the thoracic duct to be followed up- wards beneath the arch of the aorta and along the oesophagus, till it leaves the upper aperture of the thorax. The azygos or intercostal veins, one on the right, and two on the left of the aorta, should be likewise dissected. After raising the pleura from the inner surface of the and of thorax, the gangliated cord of the sympathetic nerve will be thetic. seen lying along the side of the spinal column, over the heads of the ribs. Branches should be followed outwards from the ganglia to the intercostal nerves, and others should be traced inwards over the bodies of the vertebrae to form the three trunks of the splanchnic nerves.

These vessels adhere to the posterior part of the bronchial tubes, and so enter the interior of the lung, in which they ramify (p. 385.); they give some twigs to the bronchial glands and the oeso- phagus. One The artery of the right lung arises either in common with one of the left bronchial arteries (superior), or from the first intercostal artery of the right side. two left. For the left lung there are two arteries (superior and in- ferior), that arise from the aorta at a distance from each other.

Small mediastinal branches (posterior) supply the con- ^^^^^^^^s- nective tissue and the glands in the posterior part of the in- branch- terpleural space. 5. The intercostal arteries are commonly ten or nine in inter- - number on each side, and are furnished one to each of the arteries, lower intercostal spaces.

At first this artery lies in the centre of the branch intercostal space, beneath the pleura and a fascia between the in- fntelcS- tercostal muscles, and resting on the external intercostal layer. ^^^^'^ But near the angle of the rib it ascends to the upper limit of the space, and then continues onwards between the muscular strata nearly to the anterior third of the intercostal space, where it ends in two branches that anastomose with the intercostal arteries of the internal mammary (p. 2G6.). Accompanying the artery are with the intercostal nerve and vein, — the vein being commonly above, andvein, and the nerve below it; but in the upper spaces the nerve is at first higher than the artery, though it soon takes its place below Offsets, that vessel. Branches are furnished to the layers of intercostal muscles and the ribs : about the centre (from front to back) of the intercostal space a superficial twig accompanies the cutaneous nerve. The upper artery of the set anastomoses with the superior inter- Anasto- costal branch of the subclavian artery; and those below the true ribs enter the abdominal wall, and anastomose in it with the arteries of that part. h.

Each intercostal offset from it divides into an anterior and a posterior branch, like the arteries from the aorta. The The vein corresponding to the right artery opens into the innominate vein. On the left side the superior intercostal on the , , ^ right vein is formed by branches from the two or three highest and on *' ^ leftside, spaccs; it is joined by the left bronchial vein, and ends in the left innominate vein, after crossing the arch of the aorta. Two or The PREVERTEBRAL OR AZYGOS VEINS are One or two in azygos number on the left side, and one on the right, and receive branches corresponding to the offsets furnished by the de- scending part of the thoracic aorta. By means of the larger or right vein, the inferior cava communicates with the su- perior, so that blood may reach the heart from the lower part of the body or vice versa, if one of the cavse should be obliterated. Large The larger or right azygos vein begins in the lumbar i'f o?i°^ veins on the right side of the spine, and its origin is de- side of scribed with the vessels of the abdomen. It enters the thorax through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, and ascends on the right side of the thoracic duct, over the inter- andjoins costal artcries and the bodies of the vertebrse. Opposite the cava. third intercostal space, the vein arches forwards above the root of the right lung, and enters the superior cava as this vessel pierces the pericardium.

It receives the four or five lower intercostal veins of the left Branch- side, and some oesophageal and mediastinal veins. Most commonly there is a left upper azjgos vein (M. j^JJ^^her Breschet), which is formed bj offsets from the spaces be- azygos tween the superior intercostal vein and the highest branch (upper), of the left lower azjgos. Receiving three or four branches, the trunk either joins the lower azjgos of its own side, or crosses the spine to open separatelj into the right vein. The GESOPHAGUS is a hollow muscular tube which extends geso- from the pharjnx to the stomach. The cervical part of the fs^^pf"uy tube has been described at page 128., and the thoracic part ^""^^^ is now to be examined. Entering the thorax rather to the left of the middle line, and the gullet is directed inwards beneath the arch of the aorta, ^" and reaches the middle of the spine about the fourth or fifth where it dorsal vertebra. From that spot it is continued through the y^s in ^ ° front of greater part of the interpleural space on the right of the ^^^^^ aorta, and superficial to the other contiguous bodies; but at ^^^^^^ the lower part of the thorax, it is again inclined to the left, a'll?"^^ over the aorta, to gain the oesophageal opening of the dia- p^^'^^s'^- phragm. As far as the arch of the aorta the oesophagus parts lies beneath the trachea, though it is inclined somewhat to S^^'J^^^^'^^ the left of the air tube: but bejond the arch it is crossed by the left bronchus, and is concealed bj the pericardium, down to the diaphragm. In this extent the tube is covered on the on the sides bj the pleurae, and lies, below the arch, on the right of the aorta.

Below the situation of the bronchus the pneumo- gastric nerves surround the oesophagus with their branches,DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 390 and above tlie same spot the thoracic duct will be found to the left of the tube. Three Structure. — If a piece of the middle of the gullet be in it. removed and distended with cotton wool, it will be found to consist of a muscular, a fibrous, and a mucous coat. Amus- The muscular coat is thick and strong, and consists of coat of two layers of fibres; the external of these is longitudinal, and the internal circular in direction, like the muscular tunic of the other parts of the alimentary tube. In the upper third of the oesophagus the fibres are red, and have the voiun- striated or voluntary muscular fibres mixed with the invo- involun- luntary; but below this the striated fibres gradually dis- ffbres. appear, the colour becoming paler with their absence, and then only involuntary muscular fibres remain. Exter- The external layer is formed of parallel longitudinal gitudinal fibres, which form an entire covering, and end below on the t^ten-^'^ stomach. The fibres begin by longitudinal bands opposite points' the cricoid cartilage (p. 139.); and at intervals vary- " ing from half an inch to an inch and a half, they are con- nected with tendinous points (gV*^ to*^ v[\q\^ long, and gLth wide) like the fibres of the rectus abdominis muscle. and in- The internal layer of circular fibres is continuous above ternal . ci^cidar with the fibres of the pharynx; these are more oblique at the middle than at either end of the oesophagus. a)at°"^ The JihrQUS layer is between the muscular and mucous coats, and attaches one to another loosely. Mucous The mucous coat or lining will be seen on cutting open the tube to be reddish in colour above, but pale below, and of some thickness. It is very loosely connected with the mus- cular coat, and is thrown into longitudinal folds when the oesophagus is contracted. Lining the interior is a thick layer of scaly epithelium, and the surface is studded with minute papillae. Some compound glands (oesophageal) are scattered along the tube ; and at the lower part of the gullet they form a ring (cardiac glands) close to the stomach.

Besides these, the large thoracic duct traverses the thorax in its course from the abdomen to the neck. a. Lymphatic glands. — Along the course of the internal several mammarj^ artery is a chain of sternal or mediastinal glands, grinds, which receive lymphatics from the front of the chest, the lvb?ch thymus gland, the pericardium, and the upper surfaces of lymph- the diaphragm and liver. On each side of the spine, near fo\\lcu the heads of the ribs as well as between the intercostal mus- cles, is a set of z/z^erco^to/glands, that receives the lymphatics of the posterior wall of the thorax. At the division, and along the side of the trachea are numerous bronchial glands, through which the lymphatics of the lung pass. And be- neath the arch of the aorta are a few cardiac glands, which receive the lymphatics of the heart. Along the side of the aorta and oesophagus is a chain of (esophageal glands, which are joined by the lymphatics of the oesophagus, and commu- nicate with those of the lungs. b. The thoracic duct is the great channel by which the Thoracic lymphatic and lacteal fluid of all the lower half of the body, and that of the left side of the upper half of the body, is conveyed into the blood. The duct begins in the abdomen begins in in an enlargement (chyli receptaculum), and ends in the left domen" subclavian vein of the neck. It is from eighteen to twenty in neck, inches in length, and is contained in the thorax, except at its origin and termination. It has the undermentioned connec- connections:—Entering the cavity on the right side of the in the aorta and through the same opening, the duct ascends on the right of that vessel, between it and the vena azygos, as high as the arch. Opposite the second dorsal vertebra it passes beneath the arch of the aorta and the left subclavian artery, and is applied to the left side of the oesophagus, by which it is conducted to the neck. Lastly, at the lower part of the neck, the duct arches outwards, as before described (p. 125.), to open into the left subclavian vein. In this course the May be tube is oftentimes divided in two, which unite again, or its divisions may even form a plexus ; and near its termina- tion it is generally branched. It is provided with valves is fur- at intervals, like a vein, and these are in greater number wuh^' at the upper than at the lower part. Occasionally the duct may be found on the left instead of the right side of the aorta.392 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. Receives Branches,— In the thorax the duct receives the lym- atics. phatics of the left half of the wall of the cavity, viz. from the sternal and intercostal glands; also, the lymphatics of the left lung, those of the left side of the heart, and those of the trachea and oesophagus. Right c. The right lymphatic duct, though not in the thorax, is mainly formed by the large branches received from the is in the visccra in that cavity. It is a short trunk at the lower part neck. of the neck, which is about half an inch in length, and opens into the angle of union of the subclavian and jugular veins of the same side (p. 76.). Its opening is guarded by valves. JeivGs Branches. — Into this trunk the lymphatics of the right atic?o'f ^PP^^ limb, and the right side of the head and neck pour and of^ contents. In addition, the lymphatics of the right side thorax chest, thosc of the right lung and the right side of the heart, and some from the right lobe of the liver, after passing through their respective glands, unite into a few large trunks that ascend beneath the innominate vein to reach the duct in the neck. Their Structure of the ducts. — The wall of these tubes resembles struc- ^ fin structure that of the bloodvessels : — it has an external like blood- stratum of areolar tissue ; an inner lininsr of thin nucleated vessels.

The branches of the upper six are very small, and are in the distributed to the aorta, and the vertebras and their lig a- six gan- ments. Mr. Swan describes a plexus in front of the spine, fets are as formed by the union of the branches of opposite sides. From the third and fourth ganglia offsets enter the posterior pulmonary plexus. The branches of the lower six ganglia are larger and in the much whiter than the others, and are united together to six, ^ form visceral nerves (splanchnic) of the abdomen. These whue, splanchnic nerves are three in number (large, small, and three nerves. smallest), and pierce the diaphragm to end in the solar and renal plexuses. a. The great splanchnic nerve is a large white cord, which Great arises by roots apparently from only four or five ganglia n^J^"^^' (sixth to the tenth), but its fibres may be traced upwards on the knotted cord as high as the third ganglion. The which nerve descends on the bodies of the vertebrae, pierces the semi- fibres of the crus of the diaphragm, and ends in the semi- gan- lunar ganglion of the abdomen.—(See Nerves of the Abdomen.) At the lower part of the thorax the nerve may be divided into large bundles ; and it may present a ganglion, or more than one, on its different bundles. b. The small splanchnic nerve is formed by roots from the smaii tenth and eleventh ganglia, or their intervening cord: and in the thorax it communicates sometimes with the great splanchnic nerve.

Soft Between the ribs, forming part of the wall of the thorax, bound- are the two layers of intercostal muscles, with the inter- thorax! vening nerves and arteries. At the base of the thorax is the diaphragm, which bounds the cavity in this direction. Inter- INTERCOSTAL MusCLES. — The anterior part of these muscles, musclcs has been described with the wall of the thorax in the dissection of the upper limb (p. 264.).

The INTERCOSTAL NERVES are the anterior primary branches inter- costal of the dorsal nerves. In distribution they differ from the nerves are not other spinal nerves of the body, inasmuch as they course joined in forwards almost horizontally to the middle line without being united in a plexus. Twelve in number, they occupy the intercostal spaces, except the last which is below the twelfth rib. The following difference obtains between the Upper upper and the lower nerves, viz. that the upper six lie in the between the ribs in all their extent, and are confined to the iJwerVix wall of the thorax, whilst the lower six are contained in them in part in the abdominal wall in front of the line where the ribs cease.

The ligaments attaching the costal cartilage to the rib and To rib the sternum are to be dissected on the part of the anterior num. wall of the thorax that was removed in opening the thoracic cavity. A. Ligaments from the head of the rib.—The head of the Liga- rib is received into a hollow on the side of the bodies of of head two contiguous vertebrae, except in the first, eleventh, and are twelfth ribs; and the articulation is provided with two re- taining ligaments—costo-vertebral and interarticular, and two synovial sacs. The costo-vertebral ligament, which is also named stellate costo- from its form, is composed of radiating fibres, and fixes the brai or ribs to the vertebrae. In those ribs that touch two vertebrae it consists of three sets of fibres: — the upper set, the largest, is attached to the body of the vertebra above the rib ; the lower one descends to the inferior of the two ver- tebrae with which the head articulates ; and the central part is united with the fibro-cartilage between those vertebrae, differs in Where the rib is articulated with one vertebra, as in theDISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 398 firstj eleventh, and twelfth, this ligament is limited also to the one centrum, inter- The inter articular ligament will be seen when the stellate articu- lar ligament is divided.

And there is one synovial sac between the rib and its transverse process. anterior The anterior costo-transverse ligament is laro^er and costo- ^ ^ trans- longer than the others ; it ascends from the upper border of the neck of the rib to the lower edge of the transverse process of the upper of the two vertebrae with which the head of the rib is connected. It is wanting necessarily in the first rib. Between this ligament and the vertebrae the pos- terior branches of the intercostal artery and dorsal nerve pass backwards ; and by the outer edge it is continuous with the fibrous membrane between the strata of the inter- costal muscles. Pos- The posterior costo-transverse is placed at the posterior costo- aspect of the rib. It is a short band of fibres between the verse, tip of the transvcrsc process of each vertebra and the rough part of the tubercle of the rib. This band is longest on the lowest two ribs. Middle The middle or interosseous costo-transverse is placed hori- trans- zoutally bctweon the neck of the rib and the transverse process with which the tubercle articulates. It will be best seen by sawing horizontally through the rib and the trans- verse process. Its fibres are mixed with reddish connective tissue.

C. Ligaments from the cartilages of the ribs.—The costal union cartilages of the true ribs are united to the sternum by costal anterior and posterior ligaments, which cover a synovial lages" membrane; and they are further joined externally to the bony part of the rib. Some of the lower cartilages touch each other, and are connected together by fibrous bands and synovial membrane. a. In the chondro-sternal articulation^ the cartilages of with the the true ribs are received into the depressions on the side of num; the sternum, and are fixed in their position by surrounding fibres, but chiefly in front and behind, where these give rise to an anterior and a 'posterior ligament. Between the car- tilage and the articular surface of the bone is a synovial membrane. A separate band of fibres passes between the cartilage of the seventh rib and the xiphoid cartilage, and is named costo-xiphoid ligament b. Costal cartilage with the rib. — The bony part of the with the rib is hollowed to receive the costal cartilage, and the only investing membrane between the two is that of the perios- teum of the rib. c. One costal cartilage to another, — The contiguous sur- with one faces of the costal cartilages, from the sixth to the ninth, are ^ connected by ligamentous fibres, and the articulations are provided with synovial membranes. Articulation of the Pieces of the Sternum.—The union of « T .

These ligaments have a general resemblance along the spinal column, and one description will suffice for all except for those between the first two vertebrae and the head, and those between the bones of the pelvis. The description of the special ligaments, thus excepted, will be found in the dissection of the neck (p. 182.) and in that of the ligaments of the pelvis.DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 400 SeThe Dissection, — After the dissection of the ligaments of the hir^^ ribs, the same piece of the spinal column will serve for the ments. ligaments of the bodies and articular processes of the verte- brae. It is supposed that the spinal canal has been opened to examine th^e spinal cord, and that the posterior ligament of the bodies of the vertebrae is therefore laid bare, but if the canal should not be opened, the arches of the vertebrae must be sawn through close to the articular processes. The anterior ligament of the bodies will be prepared with verj little trouble, by only removing the connective tissue. The remaining ligaments between the neural arches and the spines of the bones may be defined on those pieces that have been taken away in opening the spinal canal. The A.

Opposite the dorsal and lumbar intervertebral substance it is wider than at the centre of the bodies of the vertebrae, and sends off401 LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRA. on each side a pointed process to be attached to the pedicle of the neural arch, so that the margins are zigzag or dentate in those regions of the spine. Its fibres are superficial and attach- deep as in the anterior ligament, and are more closely united and with the intervertebral substance than with the bone. One connec- surface of the ligament is in contact with the dura mater; and between the opposite surface and the vertebras are the large veins issuing from those bones. Dissection, — To see the intervertebral substance, the an- To sec terior and posterior common ligaments must be taken away, terverl One vertebra should be detached from the intervening fibre- sub- cartilage to obtain a horizontal view of this structure; and two other vertebrae should be sawn vertically to see the difference in the consistence, and the arrangement of the laminae. The intervertebral substance is placed between the con- inter- tiguous surfaces of the bodies of the vertebrae, from the axis sub- to the sacrum. Taking the shape of the vertebrae it forms ^^^g"j^e an almost circular disc between those bones; it is connected f^^P^ in front and behind, with the anterior and posterior common ligaments, and, on the sides, with the stellate ligaments of the heads of the ribs. These masses are thicker between and gives the lumbar and cervical, than between the upper dorsal Ver- curves to tebrae; and where the spinal column is arched forwards, as spine, in the loins and neck, they are deepest at the anterior edge. By means of the dissections before made, the interverte- consti- bral substance may be observed to consist of two distinct parts j parts; an external, firm and laminar, and an internal, soft and elastic. The outer laminar part forms more than half of the disc, the outer and is composed of a series of pieces of fibro-cartilage, alter- of lami- nating with layers of fibrous tissue. All the strata are ar- j^^^ ranged one within another, like the scales of an onion, and ^^^"2^^» are connected by their edges to the bodies of the vertebrae; but all have not a vertical position between the vertebrae, for not ver- the external pieces are bent, so that the convexity is towards the surface, and the internal are convex towards the centre of the disc. The laminae of the fibro-cartilage form com- plete rings less frequently than the layers composed of fibrous tissue. Each layer is constructed of oblique fibres, and the then-^ fibres of one layer are directed across those of another like cross. D D402 DISSECTION OP THE THOKAX. the parts of the letter X. This disposition of the fibres will be best seen on the discs between the lumbar vertebrae; and it may be rendered evident by dissecting layer after layer. Inner The Central portion of the disc is very soft and elastic, and projects when two vertebrae and the interposed mass without are sawn through. It has a yellowish colour, and is deficient marked , • n . i . strata; in the stratiiorm arrangement so conspicuous at the circum- ference. Towards the confines of the two portions of the con-^ intervertebral substance, there is still an alternating arrange- tion. ment of fibrous tissue and fibro-cartilage, though the former is gradually diminishing; but towards the centre a loose fibro-cartilaginous material preponderates, and amongst it are spaces containing much fluid. Carti- The surfaces of the vertebrae in contact with the discs, vel-ing' have a cartilaginous covering. This may be seen by cutting bones. intervertebral substance from the bone. Over the centre of the osseous surface it forms a continuous layer, but towards the circumference it consists of separate pieces. Several B. Ligaments of the processes of the vertehrce, — The ments of scvcral proccsscs of the vertebrae have special uniting liga- tebrai mcuts I — thus the articular processes are joined by a cap - cesses, sular ligament and a synovial membrane ; the neural arches are connected by yellow ligaments; the spinous processes have one band along the tip and another between their borders; and the transverse processes are provided with intervening bands of fibres. To the Ligaments of the articular processes. — Between the far)a"e articulatiug processes there is a moveable joint. The bones and^sac. covercd with cartilage, and are surrounded by a loose capsular ligament of scattered fibres enclosing a synovial membrane. In the cervical region of the spine the capsular ligaments are larger and looser than in the dorsal or lumbar part. Those b.

Each consists of elastic yellow tissue, and is attached ments. above to the inner surface of the one arch, but below to theLIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRiE. 403 upper border, and somewhat to the outer surface of the other. On each side the ligament reaches from the articular process to the root of the spinous process. Between the first two vertebrae and the skull there are special fibrous ligaments in the corresponding situation (see p. 182.). c. Ligaments of the spines,—Along the tips of the spinous Those processes of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae is a longitudinal spines band of fibres, — the supraspinous ligament. It is thicker ^^^^}^^. in the lumbar than in the dorsal region of the spine, and is formed by superficial and deep fibres ; the former reaching over three or more spines, whilst the latter pass from bone to bone. It is closely united with the tendons of the muscles. The band called ligamentum nuchae, which is composed of fibrous tissue, takes its place in the neck. Along the spinal column there are also thin and somewhat and be- , . . tween membranous interspinous ligaments, which reach from the the n spines. root to the tip of the spinous processes. The strength of these bands is dependent upon the interval they have to fill; they are more marked in the lumbar than in the other vertebrae, but they are least strong in the cervical region. d. Ligaments of the transverse processes.— In the loins Those the intertransverse ligaments are thin membranous bands in trans- the intervals between the processes. In the dorsal vertebrae pro!^ they are round bundles of fibres. And in the neck the fibres exist only at the apex of the processes, or they may be wanting here and there. DD 2404 CHAPTER V. DISSECTION OF THE BACK. How the According to the mode of dividing the body, the dissection tionis to of the back will in one school be allotted to one student; and bG con- ducted, in another school it will be undertaken conjointly by the dissectors of the head and the upper limbs,— one preparing the cervical, the others the dorsal and lumbar regions. If the last arrangement should be the one adopted as in this school, the dissector of the upper limb may give his atten- tion only to those paragraphs that are marked with an asterisk ; and the dissector of the neck may take specially the paragraphs which are not so marked. Position * Position,—For this dissection the body lies with the face of body. . . *^ downwards ; and the trunk is to be raised by blocks beneath the chest and the pelvis, so that the limbs may hang over the end and sides of the dissecting table. To make tense the neck, the head is to be depressed and fastened with hooks. Dissec- * Dissection,—In the back the student will meet with suc- cessive strata of large muscles, five in all, amongst which vessels and nerves are interspersed. fo raise The first stcp in the dissection is to raise the skin from the surface in two flaps, by means of the following incisions: — One cut is to be made along the middle line of the body, from the occipital protuberance to the back of the sacrum: another incision is to be carried from the last dorsal verte- bra to the acromion process of the scapula. The flap of skin above the last cut is to be turned outwards by both dissectors. The remaining piece of integument is to be detached by a transverse incision opposite the crest of the ilium, and then to be reflected by the dissector of the upper limb in the same direction as the other flap. Under the upper flap of skin is the trapezius, and underneath the lower one is the latissimus dorsi muscle. Seek The cutaneous nerves may be now sought in the subcu-CUTANEOUS NERVES. 405 D D 3 taneous fatty layer. Small cutaneous arteries accompany cuta- the nerves, and guide the student to their position. These ne?ves. nerves vary much in size in the different parts of the back, and their number is also irregular: as a general rule, there is one corresponding to each vertebra. In the neck and opposite the upper part of the thorax, the nerves will be found near the spines of the vertebrae, and beneath the superficial fat; but over the lower part of the thorax, and in the loins, they issue in a line with the angles of the ribs. The cutaneous branches of the sacral nerves come into the dissection of the lower limb. * Cutaneous Nerves.—The tegumentary nerves of the cuta- back are derived from the posterior primary branches of nerves the spinal nerves ; these subdivide amongst the deep parts rived, into two branches^ inner and outer, and the cutaneous offsets are derived at one spot from the external, and at another from the internal branch. Small arteries accompany the greater number of the nerves; these bifurcate like the nerves, and the cutaneous offsets are derived in the same way from the one or the other branch. Cervical nerves. — In the neck the nerves are derived from the in the inner of the two branches into which the primary trunks bifurcate: they perforate the trapezius, and supply the neck and the back of the head. They are four in number, viz. one from each nerve, ex- cept the first and the three last. The hranch of the second nerve is named large occipital, and accompanies the occipital artery to the back of the head (p. 9.). The hranch of the third cervical nerve supplies a transverse offset to the neck, and then bends upwards to the lower part of the head, where it is united with the great occi- pital nerve, and is distributed internal to it. * Dorsal nerves, — These are obtained from both the inner and in the the outer branches of the primary trunks—the upper six from the region, former, and the lower six from the latter. On the surface they are directed outwards in the integument over the trapezius and latis- simus dorsi muscles. The upper six nerves perforate the trapezius near the spines of the vertebrse; and the branch of the second, which is larger than the rest, reaches as far as the scapula. The lower six nerves pierce the latissimus dorsi mostly in a line with the angles of the ribs; these are oftentimes uncertain in number. * Lumbar nerves. — In the loins the nerves are derived from in the the outer branches of the primary trunks, and only from the first three; they perforate the latissimus dorsi muscle in a line with theDISSECTION OF THE BACK. 406 outer border of the erector 'spinse, and crossing the iliac crest of the innominate bone, are distributed in the integuments of the buttock. Dissec- * Dissection.—The superiSicial fascia is now to be taken from the trapezius and latissimus dorsi in the direction of the fibres of each, viz. from the shoulder to the spinal column; and the upper limb is to be carried backwards or forwards according as it may be necessary to put on the stretch the different portions of the muscles. Some of the cutaneous nerves may be left, in order that they may be traced afterwards through the muscles to their origin. Two * First Layer of Muscles.—Two muscles, the trapezius muscles in^first and the latissimus dorsi, are present in this layer. Trape- * The TRAPEZIUS MUSCLE is triangular in shape, with the base towards the spine, but the two muscles taken together have a trapezoid form. The muscle has an extensive apo- origin neurotic origin along the middle line, from the head to the roticf" loins, viz. from the spines of the dorsal vertebrae and their supraspinous ligament; from the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra; from the ligamentum nuchas between the last point and the head; and lastly from the inner third of the superior transverse ridge of the occipital bone. From this origin the fibres are directed outwards, inser- Converging to the shoulder, and are inserted into the outer fleshy, third of the clavicle, at its posterior aspect; into the pos- terior border of the acromion ; and into the upper edge of the spine of the scapula as far as to an inch of the root of that process, as well as into a rough impression on the Connec- surface of the spine at the hinder part. The muscle is sub- cutaneous. At its origin it is tendinous between the sixth cervical and the third dorsal vertebra, as well as at its attach- ment to the head; and at the outer side the lowest fleshy fibres end in a small triangular tendon, that glides over the smooth surface at the root of the spine of the scapula. The anterior border bounds behind the posterior triangular space of the side of the neck. By its insertion the trapezius cor- responds to the origin of the deltoid muscle. Trace * Dissectlon.—The fibres of the trapezius are to be divided Icces- near the scapula, and over the spinal accessory nerve, so ^^^^* that the ramifications of that nerve in the muscle, and its junction with the branches of the cervical plexus may beFIRST LAYER OF MUSCLES. 407 traced. A small artery to the trapezius (art. superficialis colli) accompanies the nerve.

The nerve is dis- tributed to the muscle, and its filaments reach nearly to the lower border. * Dissection. — To see the parts that are covered by the Dissec- trapezius, this muscle is to be divided longitudinally, internal reflect to the position of the spinal accessory nerve, and the two zius; parts are to be thrown inwards and outwards. * The dissector of the upper limb should clean the fibres to clean of the rhomboidei and levator anguli scapula? muscles, muscles; which are fixed to the base of the scapula ; and whilst this is being done, the scapula is to be drawn away from the trunk to make tense the fibres. The dissector of the neck should define the parts beneath to dissect parts in the clavicle, viz. the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle the neck, with the suprascapular nerve and artery; the transverse cervical vessels ; and the small branches of nerves to the levator anguli scapulae, and the rhomboid muscles. If the trapezius be detached in the neck, the ligamentum nuchae, from which it takes origin, will be brought into view. * Parts covered by the trapezius,—The trapezius conceals Parts' covered in the neck the splenius and a small part of the complexus, by tra- pezius. with the levator anguli scapulae ; and in the dorsal region it covers the following muscles — the rhomboidei, the erector spinae, and the latissimus dorsi. As it reaches the scapula it lies over the supraspinatus muscle. The ligamentum nuchce is a narrow fibrous band, that Liga- extends from the spinous process of the seventh cervical nuch^. vertebra to the occipital protuberance. This structure serves as a partition between the muscles of opposite sides of the neck; and from the under part processes are sent down to be attached to the spines of the six lower cervical vertebrae. In man it is not formed of elastic tissue. * The LATISSIMUS DORSI is thin, and is the widest muscle Latissi- in the back ; it is pointed and fleshy towards the humerus, dorsi is , ^ . named but aponeurotic at its inner attachment or origin.

T , , • -I 1 ribs. the supraspinous ligament; along the outer side, by aponeurosis from the outer edge of the posterior half of the iliac crest, and by three or four fleshy processes from as many of the lower ribs, which digitate with pieces of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen; and between the outer and inner attachments it is inseparably blended below with the subjacent tendon of the multifidus spin^e. All the fibres converge to the inferior angle of the scapula, and after crossing that point of bone are continued forwards to be inser- inserted, by means of a tendon, into the bottom of the bi- tioninto ^ ' hume- cipital groove of the humerus (p. 263.). The muscle is sub- Connec- cutancous, cxccpt a small part of the upper border which is covered by the trapezius ; near the scapula there is a space between the two muscles, in which the ribs and the inter- costal and rhomboid muscles are seen. The lower or an- terior border overlays the edge of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen except a small part below, in the interval between the last rib and the crest of the ilium. Frequently the latissimus has a distinct fleshy slip from the inferior angle of the scapula. Dissec- * Dissection,—The latissimus is to be divided about mid- reflect wav bctwcen the spines of the vertebrae and the angle of the latissi- ^ _ , ■, n -. .

In raising the inner part of the muscle, care must be taken not to destroy the thin lower serratus with which it is united, and the aponeurosis continued upwards from the serratus. In the interval between the last rib and the iliac crest the latissimus is adherent to the aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis muscle, and should not be detached from it. Parts * Parts covered by the latissimus. — The latissimus dorsi covered , *^ by the musclc Hes on the erector spin^e, on the serratus posticus simus. inferior, and on the lower ribs with their intercostal muscles. As it rests on the angle of the scapula, it conceals the teres major, and a part of the rhomboid muscle. Its relation to the teres is worthy of note : at the angle of the scapula it is in contact with the posterior surface of the teres, but nearer the humerus it turns round the muscle, and is inserted in Forms frout of it. Betwceu the angle of the scapula and the409 THE FASCIA LUMBORUM. humerus the latissimus forms part of the posterior boundary ^^^^^^^ of the axilla. Dissection,—After the latissimus dorsi has been reflected, pissec- ' tion of the dissector of the abdomen should examine the disposi- [^^^J-*^^^ tion of the posterior tendon of the transversalis abdominis ^^^^i (fascia lumborum) between the last rib and the innominate bone. In the spot referred to are parts of the abdominal muscles ^(l^"^; that have been left in the previous dissection. Firstly, a Cached tc piece of the external oblique muscle may, or may not remain. After the removal of this muscle (supposing a part to be left), the internal oblique will be seen to be attached to a subjacent aponeurosis, and to the ribs and the iliac crest; its attachments above and below are to be cut through, and it is to be raised from the transversalis muscle, as far as it can be, towards the spine. Then the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle (fascia lumborum) appears, and perforating it are two nerves :—one, the last dorsal, with an artery near the last rib ; and the other, the ilio-hypogastric, close to the crest of the ilium. Two offsets are prolonged backwards from this fascia to f^^^' the transverse processes. To see one prolongation, viz. the ^^^^ one that is attached to the apices of the processes, the latissimus dorsi is to be cut through (both its aponeurosis and fleshy part) by an incision directed outwards from the middle line, on a level with the spinous process of the third lumbar vertebra ; on raising the outer border of the muscle (erector spinse) which comes into view, the strong process of the fascia will be apparent. After dividing transversely this first prolongation, another muscle (quadratus lumborum) will be seen: and on raising its outer border the second thin offset of the fascia will be evident on the abdominal aspect of that muscle. The fascia lumborum is the posterior aponeurosis of the Fascia transversalis abdominis muscle, and occupies the interval mm is , . part of between the last two ribs and the crest of the ilium. By its trans- , versalis cutaneous surface it ffives attachment to the internal oblique abdomi- muscle, sometimes to the external oblique, and to the aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi and serratus posticus inferior. The last dorsal and ilio-hypogastric nerves pierce the aponeurosis in their course from the abdomen. From410 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. the inner part of the aponeurosis two prolongations reach the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebraB, and enclose has two the quadratus lumborum.

Second * Second Later of Muscles.—This stratum contains lar layer, the elevator of the angle of the scapula, and the large and small rhomboid muscles. Besides these, there will be found in the neck the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle, with some vessels and nerves that turn backwards towards the scapula. Elevator * The LEYATOR ANGULi SCAPULA ariscs by tcudinous slips ofs?f-^ from the tips of the transverse processes (diapophyses) of the three or four upper cervical vertebrae. The fibres form rather a roundish muscle, and are inserted into the base of Attach, the scapula between the spine and the superior angle. At and con- its Origin the muscle is beneath the sterno-mastoideus, and nections. ... at its insertion, beneath the trapezius ; the rest of the muscle appears in the posterior triangular space of the neck. Beneath it are some of the other cervical muscles (splenius colli and cervicalis ascendens). Rhom- * Rhomboidei Muscles. — The thin muscular layer of muscles the rhomboidei, that is attached to the base of the scapula, are wo. ^^j^gjg^g picccs, large and small, separated by a slight interval. Small * The rhomboideus minor is a small narrow band, that arises from the spinous processes of the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebrae, and from the ligamentum nuchas; Attach- it is inserted into the base of the scapula, opposite the smooth surface at the root of the spine of that bone.411 SCAPULAR VESSELS AND NERVES. * The rhomboideus maior is larger than the preceding by Large „ , . -r^ ' muscle. the width of three or more spinous processes, it arises origin, from the spines of the four or five upper dorsal vertebrae below the rhomboideus minor, and from the supraspinous ligament; and its fibres are directed outwards to be fixed to the base of the scapula between the spine and the lower angle. Sometimes all the fibres do not reach directly the inser- scapula, but some end on a tendinous arch near the bone. These muscles are covered chiefly by the trapezius and the connec- latissimus, but a portion of the larger rhomboid muscle is subcutaneous near the angle of the scapula. The OMO-HYOiD MUSCLE consists of two fleshy bellies, Poste- anterior and posterior, which are united by an intervening beiiy of tendon (p. 67.). Only the posterior half is now seen. The hyoid- muscle arises from the upper border of the scapula, behind ^"^.'^.^ the notch, and from the ligament that converts the notch into a foramen. The fibres form a thin riband-like muscle, and which is directed forwards across the lower part of the neck, natTon. and ends anteriorly in the tendon beneath the sterno-mastoi- deus. The fleshy belly of the muscle is placed partly be- Connec- ^ . tions. neath the trapezius; and is partly superficial m the pos- terior triangular space of the neck, where it lies above the clavicle and the subclavian artery. It lies on the brachial plexus, and, near the scapula, on the suprascapular vessels and nerve. The suprascapular artery is a branch of the subclavian supra- trunk (p. 74.), and is directed almost horizontally outwards artery across the lower part of the neck to the back of the scapula, subcia- The vessel lies behind the clavicle, and courses along that bone, with the suprascapular nerve, but beneath the trapezius and omo-hyoid muscles, to the supraspinal fossa of the sea- ends on pula.

The transverse cervical artery is also a branch of the sub- Trans- , . verse clavian, and has the same direction as the suprascapular cervical ^ artery of412 DISSECTION OF THE BACK. the sub- branch, viz. towards the upper part of the scapula, but it is placed at a greater height above the clavicle. Crossing the upper part of the space in which the subclavian artery lies, ^^vides this branch passes beneath the trapezius, and divides into the two following branches—superficial cervical and poste- rior scapular: — super- a. The superficial cervical branch is distributed chiefly to the cervical under surface of the trapezius, though it furnishes offsets to the levator anguH scapulae and the cervical glands. posterior h. The posterior scapular branch crosses beneath the elevator of scapular. , the angle of the scapula, and turns downwards along the base of that bone beneath the rhomboid muscles. If these muscles are divided, the artery will be seen to furnish branches to them; and to give anastomotic twigs to both surfaces of the scapula, which join the other arteries distributed on the bone. This artery arises, very frequently, as a separate branch from the third part of the subclavian trunk.

Nerve of JVerve to the rhomboid muscles, — This slender nerve of rhom- muscie brachial plexus (p. 77.) takes the same course as the preceding artery, beneath the elevator of the angle of the scapula. Before its termination it supplies one or two twigs to the elevator of the scapula ; it is lost in the rhomboidei, on their under surface. uo?^^" * Dissection, — By reflecting the rhomboidei muscles to- wards the spinous processes, and removing the loose con- nective tissue, the thin upper serratus muscle which is beneath them will be laid bare.

The muscle rests on the splenius. * The serratus posticus inferior occupies the lumbar I-arger region, and is wider than the preceding muscle.

The fleshy fibres ascend to be m- Connec- serted by ofisets into the four last ribs in front of their angles, each successive process extending further forwards than the one below. This muscle lies on the mass of the erector spinas, and with it the vertebral aponeurosis is united. * The vertebral aponeurosis is a fibrous expansion, which Verte- is spread over the fourth layer of muscles, confining the aponeu- erector spinae in the hollow by the side of the spinous pro- ^^^^^^^ cesses. Inferiorly it is thickened by the tendons of the "^ents. latissimus and lower serratus, but above it is continued beneath the splenius, without joining the upper serratus, and blends with the deep fascia of the neck. It is attached internally to the spinous processes; externally to the pos- terior third of the iliac crest, blending with the tendon of the latissimus, to the fascia lumborum, and to the ribs and a thin fascia over the intercostal muscles. Below, between the pelvic and spinous attachments, it blends with the underlying tendon of the erector spinae and multifidus. * Dissection,— The superior serratus is to be cut through, Dissec- and the subjacent vertebral aponeurosis taken away, and then the splenius muscle will be denuded. The SPLENITIS muscle consists of cervical and cranial parts, spienius which are named respectively splenius colli and splenius pSts^^ capitis. The two are united at their origin. The splenius colli arises from the spines of the three or four one to upper dorsal vertebrae above the sixth. Ascending in the neck, the muscle is inserted by tendinous processes into the tips of the transverse processes (diapophyses) of the three upper cervical vertebrae, behind the attachment of the ele- vator of the angle of the scapula. The splenius capitis arises from the spines of the last one to • iT/^ -.1 , IT thehead. cervical and first two dorsal vertebrae, and from the liga- mentum nuchae as high as the third cervical vertebra. The414 DISSECTION OF THE BACK. fleshy fibres ascend and are inserted by a thin tendon into the apex and outer surface of the mastoid process, and into the bone behind it for about an inch and a half. Their The splcnius colli is smaller than the splenius capitis, and connec- , ± ± tions its fibres are more oblique. These muscles are beneath the with , ^ other trapezius, the rhomboidei, and the serratus superior; and muscles. the insertion into the occipital bone is beneath the sterno- mastoideus. The complexus muscle can be seen above the upper border of the splenius capitis. Dissec- * Dissection, — To lay bare the fourth layer of muscles, fourth the splenii must be detached from the spinous processes, and thrown outwards. The serratus inferior is also to be detached in the same way with the vertebral aponeurosis, and the connective tissue is to be cleaned from the surface of the large mass of the erector spinse, that now comes into view. sacro- * Opposite the last rib is the beginning of an intermus- irs'^nd cular interval, which divides the erector spinse into an outer fory** piece or the sacro-lumbalis, and an inner piece or the lon- gissimus dorsi. By sinking the knife into this interval the sacro-lumbalis may be turned outwards, so as to uncover the fleshy slips of its accessory muscle, which are fixed to the Offset angles of the ribs. A thin narrow muscle, the cervicalis neck^ ascendens, which is continued from the sacro-lumbalis beyond the ribs, should be separated in the neck from the muscles around by the dissector of that part.

Internally it is inserted into the transverse processes of the lumbar and dorsal vertebrae by rounded tendons; and for the purpose of seeing these tendons, the longissimus must be drawn away from the spinous processes, and its superficial apo- neurosis must be cut through below the ribs, in the line of415 FOURTH LAYER OF MUSCLES. separation between this muscle and the multifidus spinas on its inner side. Between the longissimus and the multifidus vessels spinge are the internal branches of the dorsal and lumbar nerves, nerves, and those of the intercostal and lumbar arteries. The dissector of the neck should trace upwards a fleshy Offsets prolongation of the longissimus beyond the ribs: this is neck, blended at first with the fibres of the longissimus ; but it is afterwards divided like the splenius into a cranial part (tra- chelo-mastoid) and a cervical part (transversalis colli). * Fourth Layer.— In this layer are included the spinalis Fourth dorsi; the erector spinse, with its divisions and its accessory muscles muscles to the neck; and the complexus muscle. Most of the vessels and nerves of the back are in connection with consists of this layer of muscles. * The SPINALIS DORSI is found only by the sides of the spinalis spines of the dorsal vertebrae, and is united with the lon- gissimus dorsi. Inferiorly it arises by tendinous processes from the spines of the last two dorsal and the first two lumbar vertebrae, and from the contiguous tendon of the lon- gissimus. From this origin the fibres ascend forming arches, only whose concavity looks inwards, and are connected by ten- the dor-' dinous processes to the spines of the dorsal vertebrae, as low tlhx^.' as the eighth or ninth, or only for half that extent. * The ERECTOR SPiN-^ is the muscular mass on the side of Erector the spine in the lumbar region. It is single and pointed K^gie below; and its cutaneous surface is covered near the sacrum origin, by a wide and strong tendon, which is common to it and the multifidus spinae. The muscle arises below from about the Attach- posterior fifth of the crest of the innominate bone, at the inner aspect, and many fibres take origin from the superficial tendon : in the lumbar region the fibres are also connected deeply by fleshy and tendinous processes to the whole length of each transverse process, to the tubercle (process, acces- sorius) at the root of the same, and to the layer of the fascia lumborum external to those processes. Opposite the last Divides rib it divides into sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi. The fast rib attachment on the inner aspect of the innominate bone cor- ^ responds in greater part to the origin of the gluteus maximus on the outer side. * The SACRO-LUMBALIS Or ILIO-COSTALIS is the smallest of Sacro- ii . . „ lumbalis tne two pieces resulting from the division of the erector416 DISSECTION OF THE BACK. spinas.

In the loins the muscle is contained m an apo- spina?, neurotic sheath (p. 409.), and has the multifidus spinas on its inner side : the attachments of the superficial tendon, which is common to it and the multifidus, will be described with the last mentioned muscle (p. 426.). Opposite the ribs the ilio-costalis and longissimus dorsi are concealed by the muscles of the other layers already examined. In the neck its accessory small muscles are beneath the splenius and the trapezius : the cervicalis ascendens is attached in a line with the splenius colli; and the transversalis colli and the trachelo-mastoid are more internal, or between these and the complexus. The COMPLEXUS is internal to the prolongations from the Com. longissimus dorsi, and converges towards its fellow of the opposite side at the occipital bone. Narrow at its lower end, the muscle arises by tendinous points from the tips of the Origin, transverse processes of the upper six dorsal and last cervical vertebras, and from the articular processes of the other cervical vertebrse as high as the third: to the inner side of the muscle is frequently added a fleshy slip from the spines of one or two of the lower cervical vertebras. From the tendons of origin the fibres pass upwards, the inferior more vertically than the superior, to be inserted into an inser- impression between the curved lines of the occipital bone, which reaches outwards nearly two inches from the middle line. The biventer cervicis is but a part of the preceding, inter- its ac- nal to which it lies. It is usually described as a separate piece7 muscle, and has been named from its having two fleshy bellies with an intervening tendon.

Two or three of the cervical nerves per- forate the complexus. Along the inner side is the semispi- nalis muscle, with the ligamentum nuchas. Beneath it are the small recti and obliqui muscles, the semispinalis, and the cervical nerves and vessels.

Beneath the muscle is a dense fascia, in which are contained the ramifications of the internal branches of the four or five highest cervical nerves. The first or suboccipital nerve is the most difiicult of the set to find, but all should be sought with some care: this little nerve is a short trunk, which is contained in the interval between the recti and obliqui muscles near the head, and does not branch into two (inner and outer pieces) in the same regular way as the others; it will be best found bj looking for the small twigs that are furnished by it to the recti muscles.

Deep The deep cervical artery is a branch of the superior inter- cervical jr jr artery, costal (of the Subclavian, p. 75.), and resembles the posterior branches of the other intercostal arteries. Passing back- wards between the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra, and the neck of the first rib, the vessel appears in this dissection between the complexus and semispinalis muscles. Finally, the artery ascends as high as the upper border of the semispinalis muscle, and anastomoses with the cervical branch of the occipital artery.

E E 4 vena 'profunda cervicis, that communicates with the occipital are deep and other deep veins in this region, forming the posterior plexus of the neck; and then passes forwards between the transverse processes, with its companion artery, to join the vertebral vein. The occipital vein lies with its artery, and occipital, sometimes communicates with the lateral sinus through the mastoid foramen. The dorsal and lumbar veins correspond dorsal in their branching and distribution to the arteries they bar, accompany, and end in the intercostal veins. In contact with the spinous processes and plates of the vertebrge is a and deep deeper set of veins {dorsi spinal), which anastomose freely together, and enter the veins in the interior of the spinal canal. * Dissection,—Most of the remaining fifth layer of muscles Dissec- of the back is uncovered by the previous dissection. Thus, the last between the first two vertebras and the occipital bone lie the muscles, small straight and oblique muscles: in the cervical and dorsal regions the semispinalis muscle will be seen, with the small interspinal muscles internal to it; and occupying a corresponding position in the loins is the multifidus spinse. The small intertransverse muscles in the lumbar region will be found by cutting through the erector spinse. * Fifth Layer. — In this layer are the following small Muscles muscles; — the recti and obliqui, the semispinales, inter-fifth spinales, multifidus spinae, and intertransversales.

This muscle is directed outwards very obliquely, and forms one side of the triangular space which contains the suboccipital nerve. The RECTUS CAPITIS POSTICUS MINOR is internal to the Rectus preceding, and is much smaller than it.

Here they are thin flat muscles, which reach all the length of the spines. * The INTERTRANSVERSE MUSCLES lie between the trans- inter, verse processes of the vertebrae ; but only those in the loins verse and the back are now dissected. In the neck they are double, like the interspinal muscles in the of the same vertebras (p. 179.). * In the dorsal region they are single rounded bundles, in and are found only between the lower processes: their region, number varies from three to six. Between the upper pro- cesses tendinous bands take their place. * In the lumbar region the anterior set form four thin in loins, and fleshy muscular planes between the bony processes. The posterior set are rounded fasciculi, which are attached to the accessory processes at the roots of the transverse: they have been named interaccessorii. * Dissection,—The multifidus spinse muscle, which fills the Dissec- hoUow by the side of the spinous processes, may be now muiti. dissected. Over the sacrum it will be necessary to remove spin«. from it, after examination, the thick aponeurosis that covers it and the erector spinse. In the neck, and in the dorsal region the muscle will appear on detaching the semispinalis from the spines, and turning it aside. * The MULTIFIDUS spiN^ muscle extends from the sacrum Muiti- to the second vertebra, and is much larger towards the pelvis ^plnL than in the neck. It takes its origin inferiorly from the exten" aponeurosis covering the surface; from the back of the odgin. sacrum between the central and external row of processes, as low as the fourth aperture; from the inner surface of the posterior superior iliac spine of the innominate bone, and from the ligaments connecting this bone to the sacrum. Along the side of the spine, the muscle arises diflerently in the several regions: — Thus in the loins it arises by large fasciculi from the accessory and the articular processes of the lumbar vertebrae; in the dorsal region, from the trans- verse processes of the corresponding vertebrae; and in theDISSECTION OF THE BACK. 426 neck, from the articular processes of the four or five lower cervical vertebrge.

In the middle line it is connected with the spines of the lower lumbar vertebras, and with those of the sacrum. On the outer side it is at- tached to the posterior part of the iliac crest, and to the outer row of tubercles on the back of the sacrum, being at the last spot connected with the great sacro-sciatic ligament. Above, it is continued some way on the surface of the erector spinse, but further on the longissimus dorsi than on the ilio-costal portion.

The spinal cord gives origin to the spinal nerves, and is Cord lodged in the canal formed by the bodies and the arches of tained T • • T 1 1 • n 1 spinal the vertebrae. It is invested by prolongations of the mem- canal, branes of the brain, which form sheaths around it, and is invested , by mem- supported by them in its large canal. branes. Dissection. — To obtain the cord and its enveloping mem- Dissec- branes, it will be necessary to open the spinal canal; but as get cord a preparatory step all the muscle is to be taken from the mem- arches and spines of the vertebrse. The canal may be opened by sawing through the neural arches, on each side, close to the articular processes; and the cuts of the saw should extend to the lower end of the sacrum, but not higher in the neck than the fourth cervical vertebra. As it is difficult to use the saw in the hollow of the lumbar region, a chisel and a mallet will be found useful to divide the arches of the vertebrae. When the loose bits of bone have been taken away, the tube of the dura mater will be seen to be covered by some veins and fat, and by a loose connective tissue sometimes containing fluid, especially at the lower part. The fat is to be scraped away with the handle of the scalpel, and the lateral prolongations through the intervertebral foramina are to be defined. Membranes of the Cord.—Three membranes, like those Three of the brain, envelop the cord, viz. an external tube of dura branes of mater, an internal sheath of pia mater, and an intervening arachnoid or serous covering. The dura mater forms a strong tube, and is prolonged Dura from that lining the interior of the skull. Surrounding ^^^^^ loosely the cord and the nerves, it extends along the spinal ^^^^^^^ canal, and forms a sheath as far as the top of the sacrum; loosely, but beyond that point it is impervious, and is continued by a slender cord to the back of the coccyx. The capacity of430 DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD. the sheath is much greater than is necessary for the contents; and the size of the sheath is also larger in the neck and the and is loins than in the back. On the outer aspect the dura mater slightly . . . , , .11 connect- IS smooth, whcu 2b comparisou IS made between it and that ed with . , , ^ . , bones ^ lu the skull, for it does not act as a periosteum to the bones. Between it and the osseous surfaces are some vessels and fat; and it is connected to the posterior common ligament of the It gives vertebras by a few fibrous bands. On each side the dura on spinal mater sends offsets along the spinal nerves issuing by the intervertebral foramina; inferiorly these several offsets be- come gradually longer, forming small tubes which enclose the sacral nerves, and lie for some distance within the spinal and one canal. In the midst of these tubes, into which the dura inferior mator sooms to be divided below, will be seen the slender before-mentioned impervious cord, that descends from the lower part of the tube of the dura mater to the end of the spinal canal, and blends with the periosteum covering the back of the coccyx. Dissec- Dissection, — The sheath of the dura mater with the con- remove tained cord is next to be removed from the body. For this purpose the lateral processes in the intervertebral apertures are to be cut, and the central prolongation is to be detached from the coccyx. Next, the cord and its membranes are to be divided opposite the lower cervical vertebrae, and to be removed by cutting the bands that attach the dura mater to the ligament of the vertebrae, and see When the cord is taken out, it is to be placed on a piece veri^ig?" of board, or on a table, with the lateral offsets widely sepa- rated. To show the arachnoid covering, the dura mater is to be slit along the middle, on one or both aspects, as far as the small median cord before referred to; but the membrane is to be raised whilst it is being cut through, so that the loose arachnoid, that envelops the cord, may not be injured. Lastly, the dura mater is to be fastened back with pins. Arach- The avachnoid membrane is the thin serous covering of mem- tlic cord which is immediately beneath the dura mater. Like has a the corresponding membrane in the skull, it invests the nervous centre and lines the dura mater, and consists thus of a visceral and a parietal part *; but the visceral piece, * This reflection of the membrane over the dura mater is denied hy431 MEMBRANES OF THE CORD. around the cord, is mucli looser than the like part on the brain. The outer ov parietal part is inseparably joined to parietal the inner surface of the dura mater, and gives to that mem- tached brane its shining appearance. The inner or visceral layer and ' surrounds the cord loosely, so as to leave a considerable ^^^^^^^^e interval between the two (subarachnoid space) : at the lower [^^^^^J part of the spinal canal this loose sheath is much the largest, sub- and envelops the mass of nerves that form the cauda equina. no\d' As the different spinal nerves extend to the intervertebral foramina they receive sheaths from the loose or visceral part of the arachnoid membrane, and retain the same till they perforate the dura mater. Dissection.—The subarachnoid space of the cord mav be Toex- pose, made evident, either by placing the handle of the scalpel ^ub-^ beneath the visceral layer, or by putting a detached piece of "^^^ , the cord in water, with the posterior aspect uppermost, and blowing air beneath the serous membrane. The subarachnoid space is situate between the loose or Sub- . arach- visceral part of the arachnoid membrane, and the spinal cord "oid , . -T- space invested by pia mater. Larger at the lower than at the upper part of the spinal canal, the space contains a special contains fluid (cerebro-spinal); and it communicates with the cavity and in the interior of the brain by the aperture in the fourth fino ca- ventricle. Crossing the space at the posterior part of the brain, cord, are bundles of fibrous tissue, especially in the neck, where these bands are collected into an imperfect partition There is or septum along the middle line. In the space likewise are perfect the serrations of the ligamentum denticulatum, and the roots behin'd. of the spinal nerves, with some vessels. Dissection. — For the purpose of seeing the next covering pissec- of the cord with the ligamentum denticulatum, the arachnoid next co- . , , vering. membrane is to be taken away. The pia mater is much less of a vascular structure on the Pia spinal cord than on the brain. Thicker and more fibrous in its nature, the membrane closely surrounds the cord; it ^^^^^ sends thin prolongations into the anterior and posterior median fissures of the cord, and furnishes offsets to the roots sj^^^s^ of the spinal nerves. The outer surface of the pia mater is Kolliker. According to the view of this anatomist, the membrane is a simple tube corresponding to the visceral layer in the text.DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD. 432 FibroTis rough.

Situate between the anterior and posterior roots of the nerves, the band reaches upwards to the medulla oblongata, and ends inferiorly on the lower pointed extremity of the cord. Internally it is united to the pia mater. Externally it ends in a series of triangular or tooth-like projections, which are fixed at and on intervals along the dura mater, each being about midway dura between the apertures of transmission of the roots of the points, spinal nerves. There are twenty or twenty-one of these denticulations, of which the first is attached to the dura Number mater opposite the margin of the occipital foramen, between tach- the vertebral artery and the hypoglossal nerve ; and the last these, is inserted opposite the last dorsal or the first lumbar vertebra. This fibrous band supports the spinal cord, and has been called a ligament from that circumstance. Vessels mid nerves of the memhi^anes. — The dura mater of the cord has but few vessels in comparison with that in the skull, for of dura j^-g office is different: nerves have not yet been traced into it, mater, though they have been found on the vessels that supply the cord and ff3 membranes. and nervesROOTS OF THE NERVES. 433 The arachnoid is sparingly supplied with vessels like serous membranes in general, and proof of its containing nerves is yet wanting.

One or more of the lower offsets of the dura mater, that have been cut of some length, are to be laid open to show the contained ganglion. The student should define the ganglion, and should trace the roots of the nerve to their union beyond the ganglion. Spinal Nerves. — The spinal nerves are thirty one in Trunks number. The trunks are constructed by the blending nerves.^ together of two roots (anterior and posterior) in the inter- vertebral foramina. They are divided into groups corre- ^^^^^^ spondinff to the rec^ional subdivisions of the spinal column, vange- . , ^ ment in viz. cervical, dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal. In each groups, group the nerves are equal to the number of the vertebrse, except in the cervical region of the spine, where there are eight, and in the coccygeal region, where there is only one. In consequence of the cervical nerves exceedinor the number Last . ^ nerve of of the vertebrse, the last is placed below the seventh verte- a group below bra; and thus the lowest nerve of each group will be below its corresponding vertebra. Each nerve divides into two, viz. anterior and posterior primary branches; the former of these is distributed to the front of the body and the limbs, and the latter is confined to the hinder part of the trunk. Roots of the Nerves.—Two roots or bundles of fibrils Each nerve (anterior and posterior) attach the nerve to the spinal cord; ^^^^^'^ and these blend toorether to form the trunk of the nerve anterior ° and pos- either in the intervertebral foramen, or, it may be, in the terior. spinal canal.

Roots Size of the roots along the cord. — Both roots are larger above where the nerves for the limbs arise, than at other parts of the cord, and greater in the nerves to the lower than in those except to the upper limbs ; so that the nerve roots increase in size and' from above down, except at the lower extremity of the cord, ^^^^^ * and in the dorsal region where they are of much the same size from the second to the last.ROOTS OF THE NERVES. 435 Direction and length. — As the apertures of transmission Oblique from the spinal canal are not opposite the place of origin of course, the nerves, the roots must be directed more or less obliquely. This obliquity increases from above down; for in the upper Most so cervical nerves the roots are horizontal, but in the lumbar oiiy^^' and sacral nerves they have a vertical direction around the end of the medulla spinalis. This appearance of the long and form fibrils around the end of the cord has much resemblance to equina, the extremity of a horse's tail, and bears appropriately the term cauda equina. The length of the roots increases proportionally as the Length , . , 1 . , . increases obliquity, so that m the lower cervical nerves it amounts to the depth of one vertebra ; in the lower dorsal it corresponds from with the depth of two Vertebras; and in the lumbar and down, sacral nerves each succeeding root becomes a vertebra longer, since the cord does not reach beyond the first lum- bar vertebra. Place of union of the roots. — Commonly the roots unite Union as before stated in the intervertebral foramina; and the roots, trunk of the nerve bifurcates at the same spot into its ante- vertebral rior and posterior primary branches. But deviations from ^°^^^"^"» this arrangement are found at the upper and lower ends of the spinal column, in the following nerves; — The roots of the first two cervical nerves ioin in each except . in first instance on the neural arch of the corresponding vertebra; twocer- and the anterior and posterior branches diverge from the trunk in that situation. In the sacral nerves the union of the roots takes place and the within the canal; and the primary branches of the nerves issue by the apertures in the front and back of the sacrum. The roots of the coccygeal nerve are also united in the and coo- spinal canal; and the anterior and posterior branches of its nerves, trunk escape by the lower aperture of that canal. Ganglia and their situation. — Each posterior root is pro- Number vided with a ganglion: but sometimes the first or suboccipi- gViT"^ tal nerve is without a posterior root and a ganglion. The ganglia are reddish in colour, and appear oval in shape, form whilst they are surrounded by the dura mater; and their size is proportioned to that of the root. By means of the con- dissection that has been made, the ganglion may be seen to im"^^" be bifid at the inner part, where it is joined by the fibrils ofDISSECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD. 436 Two the root; so that it might be said to possess two small gan- gangha. ^^.^^ ^^^^ bundle of fibrils, which are joined together at their outer ends, usifai "^^^^ ganglia are situate commonly in the intervertebral t'on^" foramina, but where the regular position of those apertures is wanting, as at the upper and lower extremities of the Excep- spinal canal, they have the following position: — In the neck, first two ucrvcs they lie on the arches of the first and second an^^ic- v^^tebrse.

Arteries VESSELS OF THE Spinal Cord. — The arteries on the are^^'^^ surfacc of the cord are anterior and posterior spinal. Anterior The anterior spinal artery occupies the middle line of the cord a^singie beneath the fibrous band before alluded to in that position. It artery, commences at the medulla oblongata by the union of two small and is branches of the vertebral artery (p. 189.); and it is continued to nued'by lower part of the cord by a series of anastomotic branches, which anasto- derived from the vertebral and ascendino^ cervical arteries in motic ^ ° ^ ^ branch- the neck, and from the intercostal and lumbar arteries in the es. . . ... back and loins. The branches of this artery ramify m the pia mater, and are then distributed to the substance of the cord, some entering the median fissures. Inferiorly it supplies the roots of Termi- the nerves forming the cauda equina, and ends on the central fibrous prolongation of the cord. Poste- The posterior spinal arteries^ one on each side, are continued arteries from the upper to the lower part of the cord, behind the roots of are two; nerves. Dividing into small branches, the vessels of opposite sides of sides form a free anastomosis around the posterior roots, and some cord; offsets enter the fissure of the cord. These vessels begin supe- are con- riorly by offsets from the vertebral ai'tery, and their continuity is along maintained by a series of anastomotic branches, which enter the itke an- canal along the spinal nerves, and are furnished from the same tenor. gQurcc as the twigs that reinforce the anterior spinal artery. Veins. The veins of the spinal cord are very tortuous, and form a plexus on the surface. At intervals, larger trunks arise, which accompany the spinal nerves to the intervertebral foramina, and end in the veins outside the spinal canal.

Invested by the membranes before cordf examined, the medulla occupies about two thirds of the length of the canal formed by the vertebrte, and is much smaller than the bony case that surrounds it. The extent of the cord is from the level of the atlas to the J^^^^^- lower border of the first lumbar vertebra, but its termination inferiorly may be a little higher or lower than that spot. Jj^j'i^ Its length is usually about sixteen or seventeen inches. Length. Superiorly the cord joins the medulla oblongata; and infe- J"jf^^°^ riorly it becomes pointed, being sometimes marked by one ^^^^ or two swellings, and ends in the fibrous prolongation of the ^duit pia mater named the central ligament of the cord. In the and in ^ ^ the em- embryo, before the third month, the medulla reaches all the ^ryo. length of the spinal canal, but it gradually recedes afterwards from below, as the surrounding bones increase in size, until it takes the position it has in the adult. The size of the spinal cord is much increased opposite the its size origin of the nerves for the supply of the limbs. There are creased where therefore two enlargements on it : — one corresponds to the the nerves lower cervical vertebras, reaching as high as the third; the of the other is smaller, and is on a level with the last dorsal verte- are at- bra. In the cervical enlargement, the greatest thickness is from side to side; but in the inferior swelling the measure- ment of the cord is greatest from before back. Whilst the pia mater remains on the cord, the anterior Anterior surface is distinguished from the posterior by the central dE- fibrous band and the anterior spinal artery ; and by the from ' irregular line of the anterior roots, which approaches the rSr: centre towards the lower end. Dissection. — For the examination of the structure the Dissec- student should possess a piece of the cord which has been see con- hardened in spirit, for that which is obtained from the spinal of cord, canal, at this period, is not fitted for the purpose of dissec- tion. Supposing the pia mater removed from the surface of the cord, without the roots of the nerves being detached, the student will be able to observe the following divisions in it: — Fissures of the Cord. — On both the anterior and pos- Fissures terior aspects of the cord is a median longitudinal cleft, the cord are, anterior and posterior median fissures, which mark its divi- r r 3DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD. 438 sion into halves; and along the Ime of the posterior roots of the nerves, in each half, is another slit, the lateral fissure. anterior The anterior median fissure is wider than the posterior, and penetrates about one third of the thickness of the medulla. It is lined by a fold of the pia mater, and is deepest towards the lower end of the cord. The medullary substance of the surface enters the fissure, lining it; and in the bottom of the cleft the white fibres are transverse, and are separated by apertures for bloodvessels. posterior The posterior median fissure is not so wide, nor so well marked as the anterior, but it is best seen at the upper part of the neck, and in the lower enlargement. The vessels at the posterior aspect of the cord enter this fissure. and The lateral fissure (posterior) is situate along the line fissure, of attachment of the fibrils of the posterior roots. It reaches inwards to the gray matter in the interior of the medulla. Sup- Some anatomists describe another lateral fissure (anterior) other along the line of origin of the anterior roots, but there is fissure, not any cleft in that situation. The Segments of the Cord.—Each half of the cord, viz. from divided the anterior to the posterior median fissure, is divided into ^^^^ two parts by the lateral sulcus : the piece in front of that slit and the posterior roots of the nerves is called the antero- lateral column, and the piece behind, the posterior column. A central or commissural piece unites the halves of the medulla. antero- The antero-lateral column includes rather more than coUimn two thirds of the half of the cord, extending backwards to the posterior roots of the nerves, and gives attachment to the anterior roots, andpos- The posterior column is situate between the posterior column, roots of the nerves and the central fissure along the posterior aspect of the cord.

The lateral column is limited before and behind by the roots of the nerves, and is continued with that name into the medulla oblongata. The posterior, with its small segment, is placed between the posterior roots and the median fissure behind: above, it is prolonged into the restiform body.

The commissural piece consists chiefly of a transverse these in IIP 1 • 1 1 • 1 commis- band oi gray matter, but it has a white stratum at the sure, anterior part. The gray part consists of nerve cells, and of transverse f^^^^^ nerve fibres derived from the opposite halves of the cord the gray and the posterior roots of the nerves. In its centre is a streak or band of a lighter yellow colour, which has been named the gray nucleus by Kolliker, and is composed of small multinuclear, and branched cells. The white anterior piece of the commissure is formed ^nd of partly by fibres of the anterior column; and partly by fibrils w^hj^^e of the anterior roots of the nerves, which here decussate as they cross from the one half to the other (Kolliker). It is best marked opposite the enlargements on the cord, and least developed in the dorsal region. h.

The white coverinpr of the half of the cord is composed range- ^ ment^of chiefly of nerve fibres disposed longitudinally in bundles, so matter, as to givc passago to intermediate vessels. By the projec- tion of the cornua of the gray crescent towards the surface, it is separated more or less completely into three parts — an- terior, middle, and posterior, corresponding to the columns of the cord; but the anterior and middle portions are united along their line of contact, because the anterior cornu does not reach the surface. Deep Origin of the Nerves. — The deep origin of the spinal ner^ves^ ucrves is Uncertain, like that of the cranial nerves: the tain!"^" fibrils in each root enter the gray matter of the cord, but their precise connection with it has not been made out.* Anterior The anterior roots penetrate between the anterior and roots. , . lateral columns into the anterior cornu of the gray mass, and are connected with the'anterior column of the opposite side, from and the lateral column of the same side in this way:—In column the gray matter the fibrils divide into two sets: One is di- side, rected inwards, forming part of the white layer on the front with a of the commissural piece of the cord, and ends in the anterior sSn; column of the opposite side; so that the roots of opposite halves of the cord decussate on the front of the commissure, and from The other more considerable part of the root turns outwards column to the forc part of the lateral column of the same side, and side, its fibres are continuous with it.

Intraspinal Vessels. — The arteries in the interior of vessels of the the spinal canal supply the cord and its membranes, and the spinal bodies of the vertebras. The veins form a remarkable plexus within the canal, but this will not be seen unless the veins have been specially injected. The intraspinal arteries are derived from the vessels source . . . of the alonsr the sides and front of the spinal column, viz. from the intra- vertebral and ascending cervical, from the intercostal, and arteries., from the lumbar and lateral sacral; and are distributed after the following plan: — As each artery enters the spinal canal by the interver- Distri- *' ^ ^ bution to tebral foramen, it divides into two branches, upper and the ver- lower : these branches are directed, one upwards and the and the other downwards, behind the bodies of the two contiguous vertebrae but outside the edge of the posterior common ligament, and join in anastomotic loops with offsets of the intraspinal artery above and below. These loops extend from one intervertebral foramen to another, and furnish branches to the periosteum, and the bodies of the vertebrae on their posterior surface, as well as anastomotic twigs to connect the arches across the vertebrae. Besides forming loops, the intraspinal vessels produce a central longitudinal artery, like that on the front of the spinal cord; this vessel lies on the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebrae^ and is reinforced at intervals by offsets from the loops. The intraspinal veins consist of two anterior longitudinal veins vessels, which extend the whole length of the spinal canal the behind the bodies of the vertebrae ; of veins from the bodies canai are of the vertebrae; and of a plexus of veins beneath the neural arches of the vertebrae. a.

The legs are to be raised and and kept out of the way by the following means : — After upwards the thighs are bent upon the trunk, and the knees also bent, the limbs are to be fastened in that position with a cord. For this purpose make one or two turns of the cord round one bent knee (say the right), carry the cord beneath the table? and encircling the opposite limb in the same manner, fasten it finally round the right knee.

The EXTERNAL SPHINCTER (sphincter ani externus) is a Exter- flat, thin, orbicular muscle, which is pointed in front and sphinc- behind, and surrounds the lower part of the rectum. As in rounds other orbicular muscles, the fibres form ellipses around a central aperture. The muscle arises posteriorly from the Origin, tip of the coccyx by a fibrous band, and from the superficial fascia in front of that bone. The fibres pass forwards to the anus, where they separate to encircle that aperture, and having united in front of it, are inserted into the superficial inser- fascia and the central point of the perinseum. The sphincter co^nec- is close beneath the skin, and partly conceals the levator ani. The outer border projects over the ischio-rectal fossa, and the inner is contiguous to the internal sphincter.

The same steps may be repeated on the right side, if it is thought desirable ; but the dissector should observe, before cutting away the mus- cles, the branches of the nerve to them: one nerve is also to be traced to the urethra. Next, the crus penis is to be de- tached from the bone on the left side; but this must be done with care so as not to cut at the same time the triangular ligament, and not to injure near the pubes the terminal parts of the pudic artery and nerve to the penis. The triangular ligament of the urethra (perinasal aponeu- xrian. rosis) occupies the anterior part of the pubic arch, and sup- fjglf/ ports the urethral canal. The ligament is of a triangular form, urethr^f. with the apex above and the base below ; and is about one Extent ... inch and a half in depth. On the sides it is fixed to the form, subpubic arch, beneath the crura penis. Its apex is con- nected with the symphysis pubis. Its base is turned towards the rectum, and is partly attached and partly free; — in the Attach- middle line it is connected with the central point of the perinseum, whilst laterally it is sloped towards the bone, so that it is less deep at the centre than at the sides : connected with the lower border, is a thin fascia which covers the Parts surface of the levator ani muscle in the ischio-rectal fossa. Superficial to it are the muscles in the anterior half of the perinaeal space, and the superficial fascia is united to it near the lower border. Perforating the ligament about one inch Aper- below the symphysis pubis is the canal of the urethra, but in it for the margin of the opening giving passage to the tube is ' blended by means of fibres with the tissue of the corpus spongiosum urethras. About midway between the preceding for dor- opening and the symphysis pubis, is the aperture for the dorsal Ind vein of the penis; and external to the last, near the bone on Ind^'^ each side, the terminal parts of the pudic nerve and artery to the penis perforate the ligament. The triangular liga- consists ment is composed of two layers of fibrous membrane (an- terior and posterior) which are united only below, and protect the membranous part of the urethra. The posterior layer is derived from the pelvic fascia; the anterior is a separate structure, and consists chiefly of transverse fibres, but it is so thin as to allow the vessels and the muscular fibres to be seen through it. Between the layers of the parts ligament are the membranous part of the urethra, with its456 DISSECTION OF THE PERINEUM. muscles, vessels and glands, and the bloodvessels and nerves of the penis, as the subsequent dissection will show. Dissec- Dissection. — The muscles connected with the urethra tion. between the layers of the ligament will be reached by cutting through with care, on the left side, the superficial stratum near its attachment to the bone, and raising and turning inwards that piece of membrane. By a little cautious dis- section, and the removal of some veins, the following objects will come into view with the undermentioned position: — Parts Parts between the layers of the ligament, — Near the base trian- of the ligament is a narrow transverse muscle, which is directed to the bulb of the urethra. Coming inwards to the urethra, from behind the pubic arch, is the fasciculus of fibres of the compressor urethras muscle, which surrounds the membranous part of the urethra. And below the urethra are the glands of Cowper. Beneath the bone (pubic arch) are the pudic vessels and nerve, the former giving its branch to the bulb; and below the pubes is the subpubic liga- ment. Deeper than all, the student will be able to recog- nise the posterior layer of the ligament, continuous with the pelvic fascia which separates these parts from the cavity of the pelvis. Musdes Muscles. — The muscles between the layers of the tri- thra. angular ligament, which are connected with the membranous part of the urethra, are two in number, viz. a deep trans- verse muscle, and a constrictor of the urethral passage. Deep The deep transverse muscle of the perinasum (elevator verse, urcthr^e, Santorini) is a thin flat band, on a level with the Origin, basc of the triangular ligament. It arises externally from the pubic arch of the innominate bone, and is directed in- wards below the tip of the bulb and the membranous part Termi. of the urctlira ; it ioins (sometimes bv a tendon) the muscle nation. . . . - c of the opposite side, and is inserted into the central point or the perinaeum. This muscle conceals Cowper's gland near the bulb, and is frequently placed over the artery of the bulb. Con. The constrictor muscle of the urethra (constrictor stricter ... , of ure- isthmi urethralis) encloses the membranous part of that tube, thral ^ ^ pavsage from the bulb to the prostate gland. It consists of trans- parts, verse fibres, both above and below the urethra, which are connected on each side to the subpubic arch. Internal toDEEP MUSCLES OF THE URETHRA. 457 it is a layer of circular fibres around the urethra which are not fixed to bone.* The transverse part of the muscle arises by aponeurotic Trans- fibres from the subpubic arch above the preceding, for the part distance of half an inch ; but this attachment is not very from evident unless the muscle has been dissected from behind, arch, From this origin the fibres pass inwards, and separate near the urethra into two layers, of which one passes over, the other under that canal; in the middle line these unite, ^nd sometimes by tendinous bands, with the muscle of the kiddie opposite side.

The circular fibres surround the urethra between the ^^•''^"^^j: bulb and the prostate, and form a layer about -^Qth. of an urethra, inch thick; they are involuntary in their nature, and are continuous behind with the circular fibres of the prostate and the bladder. External to these are the voluntary or transversely striated fibres of the constrictor. This layer is usually described as part of the constrictor. Its fibres are, however, involuntary instead of voluntary as in the con- strictor.

The pudic nerve will be ex- posed at the same time, and should any of the branches be already cut away, the corresponding ones may be sought on the opposite side. Pudic The pudic artery is a branch of the internal iliac; it enters artery perinasal space through the small sacro-ischiatic notch, and is distributed to the perinseum and the genital organs, courses Entering the posterior part of the ischio-rectal fossa, the pubic artery extends forwards alonff the outer wall about one inch arch ^ and a half above the ischial tuberosity, and is contained in an aponeurotic canal which attaches it to the fascia covering the obturator muscle: but at the base of the triangular ligament the vessel is much nearer the margin of the pubic arch.

From the size The im. of the vessel its place is important in the operation of lithotomy : of this^^ in the case first mentioned, it would be liable to be cut across, ["myl^^" whilst in the last it would be altogether out of the way of the knife. The artery of the cavernous structure of the penis (art. corporis Artery cavernosi) is one of the terminal branches of the pudic. At first of penis, this small vessel lies between the crus penis and the bone, but it soon enters the cavernous structure of the penis, and ramifies in it. The dorsal artery of the penis is in direction and size the con- Artery tinuation of the pudic; it runs upwards like the preceding between sum of ^ the crus penis and the bone, and reaches the dorsum of the penis by passing through the suspensory ligament. Its distribution with the accompanying nerve is noticed at page 471. It is much smaller in the female than in the male. Accessory pudic. — In some cases the pudic is not large Acces. enough to supply all the branches above described to the pudic artery, penis and the urethra. One or more offsets v^ill be then contributed by an accessory artery, which leaves the pelvis in front by piercing the triangular ligament. The source source, of this accessory artery is in the internal iliac. The pudic vein has the same connections, and the same Pudic branches as the artery, w^ith the exception that the dorsal vein of the penis does not join it. The pudic nerve is derived from the sacral plexus, and p^^'c ^ ' nerve is distributes offsets correspondinor to the branches of the pudic ^1^^ X o X artery artery. Accompanying the bloodvessels, the nerve enters the posterior part of the ischio-rectal fossa, and supplies there the inferior haemorrhoidal (p. 448.), and a large perinasal branch. Much diminished in size, it continues w^ith and ends the artery without branching, pierces the triangular ligament penis' of the urethra near the pubes, and is continued onwards to the dorsum of the penis with the dorsal branch of the pudic artery; its termination is described at page 471. The fol- lowing are its offsets : — The perinceal hranch is distributed to the perinaeum: it first sup- Peri- plies the superficial perinseal nerves, which have been already seen bSnch (p. 451.), and then extends forwards below the pudic artery, nearly to the base of the triangular ligament, where it ends in offsets to ends in the muscles, as well as to the bulb of the urethra. lowing"DISSECTION OF THE PERINEUM. 460 muscu- Muscular branches. — One turns outwards to enter the under sets?^' surface of the erector penis ; others pass beneath the transversalis, supplying it and the accelerator urinse; and one or two other slender filaments pierce the triangular ligament, and supply the muscles beneath it.

Section II. PERINEUM OF THE FEMALE. In the female the perinseum differs from the like region in Peri-' the male more in the external form than the internal ana- "em^e^^ tomy; but it has special parts distinguishing it, viz. the has spe- aperture of the vagina surrounded by its sphincter, and the parts, aperture of the vulva with the labia.

Bounding the vulva are the labia majora, one on each side. Within the Parts vulva, at the upper part, is the clitoris, with two small mem- ^uiva? branous folds, labia minora, extending downwards from it. Below the clitoris is the small aperture of the urethra; and still lower down is the vagina, whose opening is sometimes partly closed by a thin piece of membrane, the hymen.

The steps of the dissection are much the ischio- same in both sexes, and the same description will serve, rectal fossa, generally, for the perinasum of both the male and the female. First, the dissection of the ischio-rectal fossa is to be made; and afterwards the muscles, vessels, and nerves of the pos- terior half of the perin^eal space are to be examined. (See description of the Male Perineum, p. 445.) Then Ncxt the skin is to be taken from the anterior half of the anterior peringeal space, as in the male ; and the transverse incision peri- in front is to be made at the anterior part of the vulva.

Superficial fascia, — The description of this structure in fascia, the male will serve for the like part in the female with these modifications ; that in this sex it is less perfect and of less extent, in consequence of the aperture of the vulva; and that it is continued forwards through the labia majora (the representative of the scrotum) to the inguinal region. Dissec. Dissection. — The labia and the superficial fascia are to the mus. be rcmovcd, to follow the sphincter muscle around the opening of the vagina. The two other muscles that are exposed at the same time (transversalis perinsei and erector clitoridis) resemble those in the male. Sphinc.

The description of the pudic artery (p. 458.) will serve Pudic for both sexes, except that the branch in the female, corre- sponding to the artery of the bulb in the male, is furnished to the vagina. The terminal branches are much smaller too in the female. The pudic nerve has the same peculiarity as the artery Pudic with respect to the branches to the vagina, and the smaller size of the terminal part of the nerve on the clitoris.464 CHAPTEK VIII. ^ DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. Section I. WALL OF THE ABDOMEN. Direc- The dissector of the abdomen may be reminded tliat the tions for . . . , . ^ the dis- perinseum is included in the part of the body assigned to him. And he is to keep in mind that he has not only to finish the examination of that region, but to proceed as far as the end of Section III. before the body is turned for the dissection of the back. Posmon Position, — The body will be sufficiently raised by the body, blocks placcd beneath the thorax and buttocks, according to the directions given in the dissection of the limbs ; but the dissector should see that the chest is higher than the pelvis. After the abdomen has been inflated by an aperture through the umbilicus, let the markings on the surface be first attended to. Appear- Surface-marking, — On its anterior aspect, the abdomen on the is for the most part convex, especially in fat bodies ; whilst the ab. on the sides, between the ribs and the crista ilii, the surface is somewhat depressed. Along the middle line is a slight groove, corresponding to the linea alba, which presents about its centre the excavation of the umbilicus. Inferiorly the groove ceases a little above the pelvis in the prominence of the pubes; and superiorly it subsides below the ensiform cartilage in a hollow named the epigastric fossa. On each side of the middle line is the projection of the rectus muscle, and this is intersected in young and well-formed bodies by two or three transverse depressions.

Sflands. Eather above and to the outside of the pubes, the Abdo- minal opening of the external abdominal ring may be felt, and the rings, prominence of the spermatic cord descending through it to the testicle may be perceived. The internal abdominal ring is still to the outer side, though it cannot, usually, be recognised on the surface by the finger ; but its position may be ascertained by taking a point midway between the symphysis pubis and the crest of the innominate bone, and a little above Poupart's ligament. Attached to the front of the symphysis pubis in the male are the penis and the scrotum. Dissection.—The incisions requisite to raise the skin from f^^^^^^^ the sides and front of the belly are the following : —One cut is to extend outwards over the side of the chest from the ensiform cartilage to about midway between the sternum and the spine, if this has not been already made by the dis- sector of the upper limb. A second incision is to be begun in the middle line midway between the umbilicus and the pubes, and to be carried outwards to the iliac crest, and along the crest till it ends opposite the first cut; lastly, the hinder extremities of those two incisions are to be connected along the side of the chest and the belly. The piece of skin thus marked out is to be raised towards the middle line, and the cutaneous vessels and nerves are to be sought in the fat at the undermentioned spots : — Alonsr the side of the abdomen are the lateral cutaneous Position ° , . ofcuta- nerves, five or six in number, which are in a line with the "eous nerves, corresponding nerves of the thorax; they give offsets back- wards, and are then directed forwards with small cutaneous on the arteries. On the iliac crest, near the front, is the branch from the last dorsal nerve; and still farther back on the crest, is the cutaneous branch of the ilio-hypogastric nerve. Near the middle line the small anterior cutaneous nerves front will be found; these are uncertain in number and size, and are directed outwards in the integuments.

The vessels that will then appear are the superficial pudic on the inside, the superficial epigastric in the centre, and there may be an ofi"- set of the superficial circumflex iliac artery on the outside. Some inguinal glands are seen along the line of the reflected fascia. Two cutaneous nerves are to be sought; one, the ilio-inguinal, comes out through the abdominal ring, and descends to the thigh ; the other, ilio-hypogastric, appears in the superficial fascia above, and rather outside the abdo- minal ring. Separate In the disscction of the fascia, on the left side, two strata super- ficial or layers are to be made out, one above and one beneath the fascia into vessels. The layer that is superficial to the vessels is to be layers , in left raised by means of one transverse cut, not much above groin. ^ Poupart's ligament, from the front of the iliac crest to the middle line, and another along the middle line to the pubes: the position of the subjacent vessels marks the depth of this layer; and when these are reached, a flap of the fascia like that of the skin, is to be thrown down towards the thigh. To define the thinner under stratum, cut it across in the same manner as the other layer, and then detach it with the vessels on it from the tendon of the external oblique muscle. This stratum, like the preceding, is to be traced around the cord to the scrotum; and as the student follows it down- wards, he will find it connected with Poupart's ligament, and inseparably joined with the fascia lata close below that structure. Super- The superficial fascia is a single layer over the greater fascia part of the abdomen, and lies between the skin and the spe- is di- cial fascia investing the muscles; but in the groin it is into two divided into a subcutaneous and a deeper layer by the vessels and the glands. The sub- a.

Internally it is continued to the penis and the except scrotum, where it loses its adipose tissue ; and after invest- penis .and scro- ing the testicle, the layer is prolonged to the superficial tum. fascia of the perinaeum. b. The deeper layer of the superficial fascia (aponeurosis of the fascia lata, Scarpa) is thinner and more membranous t^in and than the other, and is closely united to the tendon of the branous; external oblique by fibrous bands, especially towards the linea alba. Like the subcutaneous part of the fascia, this layer is continued upwards on the abdomen, and inwards to the penis and the scrotum : in this last part it becomes very ^p^J^^^ thin, and, having passed through the scrotum, reaches the ^^P^^^^ perinseum, where it has attachments to the subjacent parts as before specified (p. 450.). Towards the top of the limb it extends only a very short distance, and ends a little below and Poupart's ligament by joining the fascia lata across the front fascia of the thigh; as it passes over the ligament it is closely joined to that band by a thin membrane. Should urine be efiused from rupture of the urethra, it Attach- will be directed through the scrotum, by reason of the attach- deter, ments of the superficial fascia in the perinseum, and then course upwards alonff the spermatic cords to the abdomen. From fused urine. the disposition of the deep layer across the thigh, it is evident that the fluid cannot pass down the limb, whilst its progress over the front of the abdomen is uninterrupted. In the female the superficial fascia of the groin is separ- Fascia in able into two layers, and the disposition of each is nearly male!' the same as in the male ; but the part that is continued to the scrotum in the one sex, enters the labium in the other, in its course to the perinseum. In the female the round liga- ment of the uterus is lost in the superficial fascia of the groin. Cutaneous Nerves. — The nerves in the superficial cuta- fascia are derived chiefly from the trunks of the lower five nerves or six intercostal nerves ; — the lateral cutaneous branches along the side of the belly being offsets from those nerves, are de- whilst the anterior cutaneous branches along the front are from the terminal parts of the same trunks. Two cutaneous off- sources.DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 468 sets from the lumbar plexus, viz. the ilio-hypogastric and ilio inguinal, are present at the lower part of the abdomen.

Last The lateral cutaneous branch of the last dorsal nerve is dorsal nerve, larger than the rest, and does not divide like the others. After piercing the fibres of the external oblique muscle, it is directed over the iliac crest to the surface of the gluteal region.

H H 3 cutaneous nerves are branches from the intercostal arteries, and with the anterior cutaneous are offsets from the internal mammary and epigastric vessels. In the groin are three small superficial branches of the femoral artery, viz. pudic, epigastric, and circumflex iliac : these last are dissected on the right side. The lateral cutaneous arteries have the same anatomy as Both the nerves they accompany. They are directed tov^ards the front of the abdomen, and end about the outer edge of the rectus muscle. The anterior cutaneous vessels are irregular in number and an- and in position, like the nerves.

Branches of the femoral artery, — Three cutaneous offsets From femoral ascend from the thigh between the layers of the superficial artery fascia, and ramify in the integuments of the genital organs, branch- and in those of the lower part of the abdomen. The greater portion of these vessels appears in the dissection of the thigh. The external pudic branch (superficial) crosses the spermatic cord, External to which it gives offisets, and ends in the integuments of the under ^^'^^^^ part of the penis. The mperficial epigastric branch ascends over Poupart's hgament, Super- near the centre, and is distributed in the superficial fascia nearly as epigas- high as the umbilicus. Its size varies very much. The circumflex iliac branch lies usually below the level of the iliac Circum. crest, and sends only a few ofisets upwards to the abdomen. Small veins accompany the arteries, and join the internal veins, saphenous vein in the thigh. The glands of the groin are three or four in number, and ingmnaf lie over the line of Poupart's ligament. They are placed be- tween the strata of the superficial fascia, and receive the lymphatics from the abdomen, from the upper and outer part of the thigh, and from the superficial parts of the genital organs.

The course of the ends in vein is backwards by the side of the artery, between the layers of ^J^xj^s'^ the suspensory ligament, and then through the triangular ligament of the urethra, to join the prostatic plexus of veins. In its extent along the penis the vein receives branches from the erectile struc- tures of that body. Each dorsal nerve takes the same course as the artery to the Dorsal glans penis, and ends like it in numerous branches to that part, pudic. It furnishes a large branch to the corpus cavernosum penis, and other offsets to the integuments of the dorsum, the sides, and the prepuce of the penis. In the female these vessels are much smaller than in the vessels male; they occupy the upper surface of the clitoris, as in tor?" the other sex. Dissection, — The surface of the external muscle of the to ex- abdominal wall is next to be freed from fascia on both sides ^^ter- of the body. It is not advisable to begin cleaning this iSque^* muscle in front, because there it has only a thin aponeurosis, which is readily removed with the fat: behind, however, the muscle is thick and fleshy, and cannot well be injured. Whilst beginning the dissection at the posterior part, the student is to carry the knife obliquely upwards and down- wards in the direction of the fibres. The thin aponeu- rosis before referred to is in front of a line extended upwards from the anterior part of the iliac crest; and as the dissector approaches that spot, he must be more careful not to injure it, especially at the upper part where it lies on the margin of the ribs.472 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN.

Its inner half is placed over the vessels passing from the abdomen to the thigh, and beneath the spermatic cord. Trianqular liqament. — From the insertion of Poupart's Trian- . . . gular li- ligament into the pectineal line, some fibres are directed gament. upwards and inwards beneath the inner pillar of the ring to the linea alba, where they blend with the other tendons. As the fibres ascend, they diverge and form a thin band, to which the name triangular ligament has been applied. Dissection. — The remnant of the external oblique is now pissec- to be taken away, on both sides of the body, to see the parts expose that it covers. The muscle may be detached by carrying obuque. the scalpel through the digitations on the ribs back to the free border, and then through the attachment to the crista ilii. The muscle may be thrown forwards as far as it is practicable, after the nerves that cross the iliac crest are dissected out; but in raising it care must be taken not to detach the rectus muscle from the ribs above, nor to cut through the tendon of the internal oblique near the same part. By the removal of the fatty tissue the underlying internal oblique muscle, with some nerves on its surface below, will be cleaned: at the lower border of the internal oblique the cremaster muscle is to be dissected out on the cord.DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 476 Parts CO- Parts covered hii external ohlique.— Beneath tlie external, vered by , , external IS the internal oblique muscle, with the ribs and the inter- oblique. costal muscles.

Situation Abdominal ring, —The opening of the internal abdominal minai ring is situate midway between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior iliac spine, and half an inch above Poupart's ligament. From its margin a thin tubular prolongation of the fascia is continued around the cord.

Lastly, as a rare condition, the tube of peri- or open, toneum may be found unobliterated, so that a coil of intestine could descend in it from the abdomen. In the female the tube of peritoneum sometimes remains in fe- . male, pervious for a short distance in front of the round ligament; partly the unobliterated passage is named the canal of Nuck. The SPERMATIC CORD extends from the internal abdominal sperma- ring to the testis, and consists of the vessels and the efferent duct of that gland united together by coverings from the structures by or through which it passes. In the wall of js ob-_^ the abdomen the cord lies obliquely, because its aperture of entrance amongst, is not opposite its aperture of exit from the muscles ; but escaped from the abdomen, it descends almost vertically to its destination. As it lies in the pas- and ver- sage, which has been named the inguinal canal, it is placed at yond. first (beginning externally) beneath the internal oblique, Sn^^" and rests against the fascia transversalis; but beyond the pa^s lower border of the oblique muscle, or nearer the pubes, it rests on the upper surface of Poupart's ligament, and has the aponeurosis of the external oblique between it and the surface of the body, and the conjoined tendon behind it.DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 484 Cover- Its scveral coverings are derived from the different strata in the wall of the abdomen, except from the transversalis muscle. Thus, in proceeding from within outwards, the student will find the following layers around the constituents of the cord: — first the subperitoneal fat, then the tube of the fascia transversalis, next the cremaster muscle — conti- nuous with the internal oblique, afterwards the intercolumnar fascia from the external oblique muscle, and lastly the superficial fascia and the skin.

Dissection. — A fibrous band below Poupart's ligament, pissec- which has been named the deep crural arch, will be found by deep cutting through the cord near the external ring, and raising it towards the inner abdominal ring : this thin band passes inwards to the pubes, and is to be defined with care. The remaining vessels of the abdominal wall, viz., the epi- and of gastric and circumflex iliac, and the ending of the internal vessels, mammary artery, are to be next dissected: the epigastric and mammary arteries will be seen, on turning up the outer edge of the rectus, one above and the other below ; and the epigastric with its earliest branches may be traced further, by removing the fascia transversalis from it near Poupart's ligament. The circumflex iliac artery lies behind the outer half of Poupart's ligament, and should be pursued along the iliac crest.

To raise upwards the muscle, its lower fleshy origin from Poupart's ligament must be detached. For this purpose let one incision be made Reflect across the fleshy part of the internal oblique, from the iliac oblique. crest towards the linea alba; and after the depth of the muscle has been ascertained by the layer of connective and fatty tissues beneath it, let the lowest fibres be carefully cut through at their origin from Poupart's ligament. By de- taching the muscle cautiously, the student will be able to raise it from the subjacent transversalis, so that it may be turned upwards on the abdomen : the separation of the two muscles just mentioned is sometimes difficult in consequence of their fibres being blended together, but a branch of the circumflex iliac artery marks their intermuscular space. The cremaster muscle is then to be divided along the cord, and to be reflected to the sides. Clean Let the dissector clean the surface of the transversalis cent muscle, without displacing its lower arched border, and trace with care the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis, to show its exact extent outwards. The fascia transversalis and the spermatic cord should be likewise nicely cleaned. Crossing the interval apparent below the489 OBLIQUE INGUINAL HERNIA. border of the transversalis muscle, is the epigastric artery, which lies close to the inner side of the internal abdominal ring, but beneath the fascia transversalis : a small piece of the fiiscia should be cut away to show the vessel on the side of the abdominal ring. Inguinal Hernia. — A protrusion of intestine through situa-^ the lower part of the abdominal wall above Poupart's liga- inguinal hernia, ment, — the part corresponding to the inguinal region, is named an inguinal hernia. The escape of the intestine in this region is predisposed to by the deficiency in the mus- '^^^.f^'^ cular strata, by the passage of the spermatic cord through naturai- the abdominal parietes, and by the existence of fossse on the inner surface of the wall. The gut, in leaving the abdomen, course either passes through the internal abdominal ring with the io4l" cord, or is projected through the part of the abdominal wall between the epigastric artery and the edge of the rectus muscle. The hernia of this region is distinguished by names (ex- Two ternal and internal), derived from its position to the epi- external gastric artery ; and by the terms oblique and direct, from lique; its position in the abdominal wall; so that the hernia that comes through the internal abdominal ring with the cord is called synonymously external and oblique, whilst the hernia between the edge of the rectus and the epigastric artery is named, in like manner, internal and direct.

The inguinal canal is the interval between the flat mus- inguinal ^ ^ canal. cles of the abdominal wall, which contains the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female.

Deeper than the fascia are the subperitoneal fat and the pe- ritoneum, corresponding with the skin and superficial fascia on the outer surface. Occasionally the triangular ligament projects far enough outwards behind the external abdominal ring, to take part in the formation of the posterior wall of Flooring the caual. Along the lower part, or the floor, the canal is of the limited by the union of the fascia transversalis with Pou- part's ligament, and by the fibres of the ligament that turn back to the pectineal line ; whilst along the upper part its extent is determined only by the apposition of the muscles.

Internal The internal abdominal ring is an aperture in the fascia nal ring, transversalis, which is situate half way between the sym- suua- physis pubis and the iliac crest, and half an inch above Upper Poupart's ligament. Arching above the aperture, and then ^"'^ descending on the inner side, is the lower border of the transversalis muscle ; this is fleshy at the outer, but ten- inner dinous at the inner half.

The external hernia leaves likewise the abdomen parts at the same spot. All the protruding parts receive as a mitted covering the prolongation of the fascia from the margin of It'^^"^'^ the opening. The external abdominal ring is the outlet of the inguinal ^^^^^j^- canaL and through it the cord, or the ino-uinal hernia, dominai reaches the surface of the body. This aperture is placed in skua- the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, near the crest of the pubes; and from the margin a prolongation is sent on the parts passing through it (see p. 473.). Course and coverings of the hernia, — A piece of intestine The in- leaving the abdomen with the cord, and continuing with follow-' this through the inguinal canal to the surface of the body, course of will obtain the same coverings as the cord, viz. one from every structure in the lateral part of the wall of the abdo- men, except from the transversalis muscle. It receives its has co- investments in this order : — As the intestine is first thrust of th?^ outwards, it carries before it the peritoneum and the sub- ileum peritoneal fat, and enters the tube of the fascia transversalis fascia ' (infundibuliform fascia) that surrounds the cord. Still in- versaLs, creasing in size the piece of gut is forced downwards to the lower border of the internal oblique muscle, where it will have the cremasteric fascia or covering applied to it. The intestine is afterwards directed along the front of the cord to the external abdominal ring, and in passing through that openino; receives the investment of the intercolumnar sperma- tic fas- or spermatic fascia. Lastly^ as the hernia descends to the cia, scrotum, it has the additional coverings of the superficial ciai fas- fascia and the skin. So that in a hernia which has passed skin, the external abdominal ring, the coverings from without in- wards are the following: the skin and the superficial fascia, the spermatic and cremasteric fasciaB, the fascia transversalis, the subperitoneal fat, and the peritoneum or sac. These '^^^^^^^^ different laminas become much thickened in a hernia that abdomi- ^ ^ ^ nal wall. has existed for some time.

If the from its protrusion remains in the inejuinal canal, the term bubonocele position. ^ ^ is applied to the swelling ; but if it has extended into the scrotum, the appellation of scrotal rupture, or oscheocele^ is given to it. Two va- Varieties of the hernia, — There are two varieties of the oblique inguinal hernia, which are distinguished by the con- dition of the peritoneal covering. For, if the piece of the peritoneum, which accompanies the testicle from the abdo- men in the fetus, remains unobliterated, so that the intestine descends in it without protruding any fresh piece of the from serous membrane, the hernia is called congenital: and should ture"of the prolongation of the peritoneum be only partly obliterated, toneai"" Say in the inguinal canal, so that the descending intestine, invested by a separate peritoneal covering, projects into or behind the unobliterated sac, like a viscus into a serous membrane, the hernia is named infantile.

Its situation and cover- ings, and the seat of stricture, will be better comprehended after the examination of the part of the abdominal wall through which the hernia passes. It passes Anatomy, — At the lower part of the abdominal wall is a ^trian!^ Small triangular space between the epigastric artery on one spice, side, the outer edge of the rectus muscle on the other, and which is the inner half of Poupart's ligament below.

Any intestine protruding in tliis spot must, it is evident, rupture or elongate the different structures, because there is not any aperture or tube by which it can descend, as in the external hernia. Further, the coverings of the hernia, and its extent Hernia and direction in the lower part of the inguinal canal, must space of vary according as the gut is forced through the part of the kinds, space covered by the conjoined tendon, or through the part external to that tendon. Course and coverings of the hernia. — The common kind ^^^^^^^ of the internal hernia (inferior) passes through the inner part ^^^^^^^ of the triangular space which is covered by the conjoined ^^^"^^^^ tendon, and then straight through the abdominal wall to the external ring; since it does not accompany the cord along the inguinal passage. The intestine in protruding carries JJ^jj^^ before it the peritoneum, the subperitoneal fatty membrane, P^^J^^^" and the fascia transversalis ; next, it either elono;ates the ^;at,. ^ fascia conioined tendon, or, as is the case in a sudden rupture, trans-; ^ ^ ^ versalis, separates the fibres, and escapes between them. Then, the ^^"^^^j^^" intestine advances into the lower part of the inguinal canal, don, where it is opposite the external abdominal ring ; and it passes outwards through the ring, lying on the inner side of the cord, and receiving at the same time the covering of the sperma- p . . -r 1 • • • 1 tic fascia, fascia spermatica. Lastly, it is invested by the superficial supers fascia and the skin. In number the coverings of this in- fascia, . 1 • 1 in and skin. ternal hernia are the same as those m the external form; and in kind they are the same, with this exception, viz. that the conjoined tendon is substituted for the cremasteric covering. 8eat of stricture. — The stricture in this form of hernia stric- occurs most frequently at the neck of the sac, next in fre- g-^^^. quency at the margin of the fissured tendon, and lastly at the external abdominal ring. The position of the openings in the abdominal wall should be kept in mind during attempts to reduce an internal hernia; and the straightness of the course of the intestine, in a comparison with an external hernia, should be remembered. Where it is necessary to open the i^s divi- , sion. hernial sac to relieve the stricture, after having divided constricting bands external to the neck, the cut is to be made directly upwards as in the external hernia. Variety of internal hernia. — Another kind of internal494 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. internal hernia (superior) projects through the part of the area of the triangular space, where only the fascia transversalis is is farther found. Its cxistcnce is dependent upon the position of the out than , . the pre- obliterated hypogastric artery behind the wall of the abdo- ceding ^ a o j in the men (p. 495.). If this hernia existed, it is evident that it tnangu- . . larspace, would picrcc the abdominal wall close to the epigastric artery, and would descend along nearly the whole of the and is insruinal canal to reach the external abdominal ring ; conse- oblique ^ . .

The constriction may be removed by cutting from above, or upwards if the sac is opened, but there is not any vessel to be injured in the operation. Other Forms of Hernia.— At each of the other natural other abdomi- apertures in the parietes of the abdomen, a piece of intestine nai her- ^ ^ . nice are may be protruded, so as to form a hernial tumour. For instance, there may be femoral hernia below Poupart's liga- femoral, ment, with the femoral vessels; obturator hernia through obtura- tor, the thyroid foramen, with the artery of the same name ; and ischiatic hernia through the ischiatic notch. The ischia- . . tic. femoral hernia, as the most important, will be noticed pre- sently ; but the student must refer to some special treatise * for his information respecting the other abdominal hernias. Dissection.— The abdomen may be now opened to see the pissec- cords and the depressions on the posterior aspect of the abdominal wall, below the umbilicus. For that purpose a transverse cut is to be made through the umbilicus across the front of the abdomen. On holding up the lower part of the abdominal wall certain cords will be seen ascending to the umbilicus from the pelvis. Cords of the abdominal wall. — In the middle line of the Cords . inside abdominal wall, at its posterior aspect, is the prominence of abdo- the remains of the urachus, which reaches from the summit of the bladder to the umbilicus. On each side is another o"ein middle cord, formed by the obliterated hypogastric artery ; this is directed from the side of the pelvis to the umbilicus, and another ^ 'on each lies usually behind or close to the epigastric artery, near side, Poupart's ligament. Fossce. — When the disposition of the cords is such as fonning ^ two fos- above mentioned, two fossae are seen near Poupart's liga- ment, one on each side of the obliterated hypogastric artery, corresponding with the situation of the internal and external abdominal rings, and with the places where the external and internal (common kind) hernias occur. But occasionally the some- ^ n, . times cord of the obliterated hypogastric is moved inwards from last cord ^ moved the line of the epigastric artery, and lies behind the trian- inwards gular space between this artery and the edge of the rectus, at the line of junction of the outer with the inner two thirds of the space.

Situation Femoral Hernia. — In this hernia the intestine leaves femoral the abdomen below Poupart's ligament, in the loose membra- nous sheath that surrounds the femoral vessels. The course that the intestine takes, and the coverings that it receives, will be readily understood after the anatomy of the parts among which it passes has been learnt. Only so much of the structures will be described here, as can be now seen, the rest are fully noticed in the dissection of the thigh. Dissec- Dissection. — The examination of the parts concerned in theVarts the fcmoral hernia is to be made on the left side of the body, concern- rpj^^ lower portiou of the abdominal wall is to be divided from the umbilicus to the pubes, and the peritoneum is to be detached from the inuer surface of the wall, and from the iliac fossa. The layer of the subperitoneal fat is next to be separated in the same way, but before doing this it will be necessary to cut through the cord at the abdominal ring : as this layer is raised^ one or more lymphatic glands will be seen by the side of the iliac vessels. Any loose tissue that remains, is to be taken away to show the upper opening of the membranous sheath which contains the femoral vessels. In this dissection the genito-crural nerve is seen on the iliac artery. Afterwards the iliac fascia and the fascia transver- salis are to be traced to Poupart's ligament, to see the part that each takes in the production of the crural sheath. Anato- Anatomy, — The structures concerned in the femoral the hernia are severally to be examined, viz. the subperitoneal fat; tures" the membranes (transversalis and iliac fascia) lining the interior of the abdominal cavity near Poupart's ligament, with the sheath to which they give origin; and, lastly, the crural ring, or the space through which the hernia leaves the abdomen.FEMORAL HERNIA. 497 The subperitoneal fat extends as a continuous layer be- subpe- neath the peritoneum, though it is thickest and most fibrous lat'"^^^ at the lower part of the abdomen, where the vessels pass under Poupart's ligament. At that spot it extends over the upper opening of the sheath of the vessels, instead of descend- ing around the vessels; and internal to the vein, it covers a space named crural ring, as well as a lymphatic gland which occupies that space. The piece of the layer that stretches forms over the crural ring is named by M. Cloquet septum crurale, cruraie. and is described by him as being concave towards the abdo- men, and convex towards the thigh ; some apertures exist in it for the ducts of the inguinal glands, and one gland is generally attached to its under surface. The fascia transversalis has been before described Fascia (p. 482.). When traced down to Poupart's ligament, it may Imaiis. be seen to join the iliac fascia external to the situation of the large iliac artery; but internal to that spot it is con- tinued downwards to the thigh, in front of the femoral vessels, and forms the anterior part of the crural sheath. The iliac fascia covers the iliacus muscle, and lies beneath fas- the iliac vessels. At Poupart's ligament its disposition is found to resemble that of the transversalis fascia; for ex- ternal to the iliac vessels it joins that fascia along the line of the ligament; but, internal to the spot mentioned, it is prolonged behind the vessels into the posterior part of the crural sheath. The crural or femoral sheath is the loose membrane that sheaih encloses the femoral vessels as these enter the thigh: it is rai ves- derived from the membranes that line the abdomen — its formed anterior half being continuous with the fascia transversalis, of pre- • , ceding. and its posterior half with the fascia iliaca. The whole of the upper part of the sheath is not filled by the vessels, for a space (crural ring) exists on the inner side of the vein, Avhich contains a gland, and through which the intestine descends in femoral hernia. The crural ring is partly described in the dissection of the a space thigh, but its boundaries are better seen now in the exami- side of • the ves- nation of the abdomen. It is the interval in the sheath, at seis is the inner side of the femoral vein ; it is about half an inch rai ring, wide, and is filled by a lymphatic gland. Close to the sheath, size and bounding it internally, are Gimbernat's ligament and the rics. K K498 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. conjoined tendon, and externally is the femoral vein. In front of the sheath is Poupart's ligament with the deep arch, and behind is the pubes. Along the front of the space, but outside the tube of membrane, lies the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female.

In front is a small branch (pubic) from the epigastric artery to the back of the pubes ; and the vessels of the spermatic cord may be said to be placed along the anterior aspect of the ring. The ring is bounded there- fore by vessels, except internally and behind, state of But in some bodies the obturator artery takes origin from theun. . . T 1 ^ 1 . usuai^ the epigastric, and comes to lie along a part of the ring as it passes to the pelvis. In that course it may have two posi- tions with respect to the ring: either it lies close to the iliac vein, and therefore on the outer side of the ring ; or it arches over the ring, descending on the inner side, at the base of Gimbernat's ligament. If the artery takes the first-men- tioned course, which is the most frequent arrangement, the inner side of the ring will be still free from vessels; but in the other condition the ring will have an additional vessel on the inner side, and will be entirely encircled except at the posterior part.

But in some few instances (once in about eighty and irre- operations, Lawrence), the obturator artery takes its un- condi- usual course, lying in front of and on the inner side of the them, neck of the sac, and will be before the knife in the division of the stricture. This condition of the vessel cannot be recognised beforehand, but the surgeon would best avoid the danger of wounding the artery by a cautious and sparing use of the knife. Section III. CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. The abdominal cavity is the space included between the Defini- spinal column and the visceral arches continued forwards from it, with the intervening muscles. It contains the di- and gestive, urinary, and generative organs, and their vessels and nerves. Dissection. — To prepare the cavity for examination, the ^^^^^^^ remainder of the abdominal wall above the umbilicus is to be open ab- . domen. divided by a cut along the left side of the linea alba as far as the xiphoid cartilage, and the flaps are to be thrown to the sides. Size and form.— This space is the largest in the body, is largest T • 1 • r» in the it is oval m form with the ends of the oval upwards and body. K K 2500 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN.

Pelvic The pelvic portion is situate below the brim of the pelvis, portion. contains chiefly the generative and urinary organs. Abdo- The abdominal portion reaches from the diaphragm to the proper, brim of the pelvis, and lodges the alimentary tube and its appendages, together with the kidneys—the secretory organs of the urine. A serous membrane, the peritoneum, lines the cavity, and covers the viscera.

Towards scribed, the end of the dissection of the abdomen, the cavity of the Tfter ^ pelvis will receive a separate notice.501 ARRANGEMENT OF THE VISCERA. Regions.— The larger upper part of the abdominal cavity Abdomi. is divided artificially into regions by lines extended between vftyTs certain points of the parietes. If two circular lines are out into carried round the body, so that one shall be opposite the cartilage of the ninth rib, and the other on a level with the most prominent point of the crest of the hip bone, the ab- dominal cavity will be divided into three parts or zones, upper, middle, and lower. Each of these zones will be further subdivided into three by two lines, one on each side, from the cartilage of the eighth rib to the centre of Poupart's ligament. This vertical line will mark off on each side a piece from each of the three circles, which is named respec- Lateral tively, from above downwards, hypochondriac, lumbar, and iliac (right and left); whilst the central part of each is desig- and nated from above down, epigastric, umbilical, and hypo- gastric. In addition, the central and lower part of the hypo- gastric subdivision is named pubic region, whilst its lateral portion is known as the inguinal region. Contents and their position,— The alimentary tube and its Parts in accessory parts, the liver, pancreas, and spleen, occupy the upper division of the cavity of the abdomen. The kidney is also situate in the same part of the abdominal space. The alimentary tube presents diflferences in form, and is General 1. . -. . , n« • 11 • • division divided into stomach, small intestine, and large intestine; ofaii- and each of these portions is further subdivided as it will tube^^^^ afterwards appear. The several viscera have the following general position: — The small intestine is much coiled, and occupies the and posi- greater part of the cavity ; whilst the great intestine arches around it. Both are fixed in position by folds of the serous position lining. Above the arch of the great intestine are situate the cessive stomach, the liver, the spleen, and the pancreas ; and below ^^"^^^ * it is the convoluted small gut. Behind the large intestine on of idd- each side is the kidney with its excretory tube. Superficial view of the contents, — On first opening the Parts of abdomen the following viscera appear: — On the right side ^^^^^^^^ is the liver, which is partly concealed by the ribs. On the dispiace- leit side a part of the stomach is visible ; but this viscus lies chiefly beneath the ribs, and is somewhat overlaid by the liver. Descending from the stomach is a fold of peritoneum (the large omentum), which reaches to the pelvis, and con- KK 3502 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. ceals the intestine : in some bodies the omentum is raised into the left hypochondriac region, and leaves the small in- testine uncovered. If the bladder is distended, a small part of it may come into view just above the pelvis. CONNECTIONS OF THE VISCERA. Connec- Before the natural position of the viscera is disturbed, viscera their connections with the surrounding parts, and their situa- seen^ tiou in the different regions of the abdomen should be ex- amined. Position The stomach. — The stomach intervenes between the iTiach. gullet and the small intestine, and is retained in position partly by folds of the serous membrane. It is somewhat of a conical form, with the larger end to the left side; and it occupies the left hypochondriac, the epigastric, and part of the right hypochondriac region. Extre- At the left end it receives the oesophagus, and it is firmly large' fixcd by this tube to the diaphragm. This end lies beneath the ribs, and is in contact with the spleen, to which it is connected by a fold of peritoneum (splenic omentum): when this part of the stomach is distended it pushes up the dia- phragm, and encroaches on the space for the heart and the small ^^^^ lung. The right extremity ends in the small intestine, and reaches towards the gall bladder; it is in contact with the wall of the abdomen and the under surface of the liver. Surfaces. The anterior surface is in contact, from left to right, with the diaphragm, the abdominal wall, and the under part of the liver; and the posterior surface corresponds with the pancreas, the pillars of the diaphragm and the aorta, and the solar plexus. Borders. The upper border is connected to the liver by a fold of peritoneum, the small omentum ; and the lower border gives attachment to another peritoneal fold, the great omentum or epiploon, which floats freely over the intestine. Connec- The conncctions with the surrounding parts will be in- pend on fluenced by the condition of the stomach: for when this dition. viscus is empty its surfaces look forwards and backwards, and its borders upwards and downwards ; but when it is dis- tended, it becomes somewhat circular, and makes a rotatory movement, so as to bring forwards the border usually lowest,CONNECTIONS OF THE INTESTINE. 503 K K 4 and to turn upwards that surface which is directed forwards at other times. The position and the connections of the stomach may be ^^^Jf/^- also changed by an alteration in the size of any of the sur- Pp^^^^^n rounding organs, or by accumulation of fluid in the chest, or ease, in the belly. The stomach may be likewise dragged down by the great omentum entering a hernial sac, or it may be forced down towards the pelvis by the pressure of tight stays. In all these different changes in its position, the right end moves more than the left, because it is attached only by pe- ritoneum to the parts around. The small intestine. — The smaller part of the intestinal smaii tube (intestinum tenue) reaches from the stomach to the right iliac region, where it ends in the large intestine. It situation is divided into three parts, duodenum (twelve fingers intes- sions!^^^' tine), jejunum, and ileum; of the last two, one receives its name from its empty condition, and the other from its nu- merous coils. The duodenum cannot be satisfactorily seen at present, Duode- and it will be examined afterwards. """^^ The jejunum and ileum begin on the left side of the Jejunum second lumbar vertebra, without any distinct mark of sepa- ileum, ration from the duodenum. Two-fifths of the intestine are given to the jejunum, and the remaining three-fifths to the ileum. This part of the intestinal tube forms many convo- situa. lutions in the umbilical, hypogastric, lumbar, and iliac re- gions of the abdomen; and it descends oftentimes in the female into the cavity of the pelvis. In front of the convo- lutions is the great omentum; and posteriorly the small in- connec- testine (beyond the duodenum) is fixed to the spine by a fold of peritoneum named the mesentery, which contains the vessels and nerves. Surrounding the jejunum and ileum is the large intestine or colon ; but on the left side of the body the large is concealed by the small intestine. The large intestine, — The large gut or the colon is sac- Large culated, and is less moveable than the small intestine. It how dis. begins in the right iliac region in a dilated part or head ed. (caput caecum coli), and ascends to the liver through the right iliac, lumbar, and hypochondriac regions. Then cross- course . ing the abdomen below the stomach, it reaches the left hypo- chondriac region ; and it lies in this transverse part of its504 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. course between the epigastric and umbilical regions, or alto- and ex- getlicr in the latter. Finally, it descends on the left side ' through the regions corresponding with those it occupied on the right, forms a remarkable bend (sigmoid flexure) in the left iliac fossa, and enters the pelvis to end on the surface of the bodj. It takes an arched course around the small in- Divi. testine, and is divided into six parts, viz. csecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid flexure, and rectum. Csecum, The ccBcum (caput csecum), or the commencement of the of colon, colon, is placed in the right iliac fossa, in which it is fixed Situation peritoneum stretched over it. In front usually are the convolutions of the small intestine, but when it is and con. distcndcd it touches the abdominal wall. Behind, it rests nections. .^.^^ fascia, Only fatty and connective tissues inter- vening. On the inner side it is joined by the small intes- tine; and it presents inferiorly a worm-like piece — the vermiform appendix. Sometimes the peritoneum surrounds the caecum, and attaches it by a fold to the abdominal wall. Ascend- The asceudhig colon reaches from the csecum to the under ion.^°" surface of the liver, on the right of the gall bladder. It lies against the quadratus lumborum inferiorly, but higher up Parts it is placed in front of the kidney. The peritoneum fixes it around, ^ ^ . immoveably to the wall of the abdomen; and surrounds commonly about two-thirds of the circumference, but it may be found to encircle the tube, and form a fold behind, as in the csecum. To its inner side are the convolutions of the small intestine, connec- The trausverse colon passes obliquely upwards and to the fhT^ left, along the curvature of the stomach, as far as the spleen; ve^rse'co. in this coursc it is deeper at each end than in the middle, '^*"' and, by being thus bent, forms the arch of the colon. In this extent it has above it the liver and the gall bladder, the stomach and the spleen; and below it the small intestine. In front is the great omentum; and behind is a fold of peritoneum, the transverse meso-colon, which attaches it to the back of the abdominal wall, and contains its vessels and isTOost nerves. The transverse colon is more moveable than any able ' other part of the large intestine, its peritoneal fold allowing largli^n- it to bc raised and placed on the margin of the ribs. Small testine.505 CONNECTIONS OF THE LIVER. pieces of peritoneum, containing fat, the appendices epi- ploicae, are fixed along it. The descending colon commences below the spleen, and Descend, reaches to the left iliac fossa. At first it is deeply placed in ion.^'^ the left hypochondriac region, and in its whole course it is deeper than the right colon. In front of it are the convolu- situa- tions of the small intestine ; and behind are the diaphragm, the outer part of the kidney, and the quadratus lumborum. This part of the intestine is smaller than either the right or ^d^^y^"^' the transverse portion; and it is less surrounded usually by t^fiie"" the peritoneum attaching it to the abdominal wall. The siqmoid flexure of the colon is situate in the left iliac sigmoid flexure fossa, to which it is attached by a fold of the peritoneum, the sigmoid meso-colon, but it often extends partly into the cavity of the pelvis. The intestine makes two turns like the letter S, and has obtained its name from that circumstance. It is concealed by the small intestine, which is directed more is in left ^ iliac foa- to the left than to the right side. The extent of this part of sa. the colon is from the crest of the hip bone to the junction of the same bone with the sacrum, where it ends in the rectum. The rectum is the termination of the large intestine, which Rectum, is contained in the pelvis : it will be seen in the dissection of that cavity. The liver. — The liver is situate in the right hypochon- Positjon driac, and epigastric regions, and reaches slightly into the uver. left hypochondriac. Folds of peritoneum (ligaments) retain it in place. The upper surface is convex, and turned to the vault of surfaces, the diaphragm, and is divided into two parts by the suspen- sory ligament; the right half, more prominent than the left, reaches to the level of the fifth intercostal space. The under surface is in contact with the stomach and the duodenum, with the ascending colon, and with the right kidney and the suprarenal body. Attached to this surface is a fold of the peritoneum (small omentum) that contains the hepatic vessels. The anterior border is thin, and is constantly varying its Borders, position to the wall of the thorax according to the distension of the stomach, and the position of the body and the dia- phragm. This edge, except a small part near the xiphoid cartilage, lies in adult males usually within the margin ofDISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 506 the ribs, but in women and children it projects below that line. The gall bladder projects beyond this edge. The posterior border is thick, and is connected to the diaphragm by certain ligaments or folds of the peritoneum ; it lies on the large vessels (aorta and cava), and on the pillars of the diaphragm. Position The liver is constantly changing its situation with the mihang ^^^^^^ ^^^^ dcsccnt of the diaphragm in respiration ; thus in phr'agm, inspiration it descends, and in expiration it regains its for- ture°of mer level. In the upright and sitting postures this viscus descends lower than in the horizontal condition of the body; so that in the former state, the anterior border may be felt underneath the edge of the ribs, but in the latter it is with- and by drawu within their margin. The connections of the liver fn^other with the surrouudiug parts may be changed by the growth parts. tumours, by collections of fluid in the chest or in the abdomen, or by constricting the space for its lodgement, as in tight lacing. situa- The spleen. — The spleen lies deeply in the left hyponchon- spieen. drium, between the stomach and the ribs, and is connected by peritoneum to the great end of the stomach on the one side, and to the diaphragm on the other side. Its position connec. is almost Vertical. Its outer surface is convex: it corre- tions. spends with the diaphragm, and is opposite the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs. At the inner surface, which is concave, the vessels enter, and to it a fold of peritoneum, the gastro- splenic omentum, is attached; in front of the vessels it touches the stomach, and behind them it is in contact with the left crus of the diaphragm, the suprarenal capsule, and the tail of the pancreas. Below the spleen are the kidney and the beginning of the descending colon. When the stomach is distended the spleen is somewhat behind it. Kidney The kidney, — The kidney should be examined on the left side of the body, so that the duodenum may not be displaced. In order that it may be seen, the descending colon and the peritoneum must be separated from the abdominal wall. This viscus is surrounded with fat, and is situate in the occupies lumbar region (one on each side), opposite the last dorsal, reborn and the upper two or three lumbar vertebrae. Its position is somewhat oblique, so that the upper is nearer than the lower Parts in end to the spinal column. In front of the kidney are theREFLECTIONS OF THE PERITONEUM. 507 peritoneum and the colon ; and behind it are the quadratus front, lumborum and psoas muscles, with the diaphragm and the ' last rib. Above each kidney and resting on it, is the supra- above, renal capsule ; and below each is the iliac crest. The inner beiow, border looks to the spine and receives the vessels; whilst inside, the outer border projects towards the side of the abdominal wall. Sometimes the two are united in front of the aorta, and form the horse-shoe kidney. Difference on opposite sides, — The right kidney is placed Right rather lower than the left; it reaches as high as the lower border of the last rib but one, whilst its fellow is opposite the upper border of the corresponding rib. In front of the Different right, in addition to the common connections before specified, before is the duodenum ; and before the left one is the lower end of the spleen. Above the riffht is the liver, and above the left and ^ ® ' above. the spleen. The connections of the pancreas may be omitted for the Pan- creas. present. THE PERITONEUM. This is the largest serous membrane in the body. Like Perito.' other membranes of the kind it is a closed sac, except in the female, in whom its cavity is continuous with the canals of the Fallopian tubes. One part of it lines the wall of the consists abdomen (parietal layer), and another is reflected over the rfetar' different viscera (visceral layer), except where the vessels cerai^*' enter. The inner surface is smooth; but the outer is rough, when it is detached from the surfaces with which it is naturally in contact. The membrane forms folds as it passes and from viscus to viscus along the vessels; these attach the foWs on viscera to the abdominal wall, and consist for the most part of two layers, one on each side of the vessels. The continuity of the sac may be traced in both a hori- zontal and a vertical direction. Horizontal circle around the abdomen.—If the membrane be fol- ^^Ij^^'^^ lowed outwards from the umbilicus, it will be found partly to en- the close the large intestine, and to fix it to the abdominal wall. From brane the colon it may be traced over the kidney as far as the middle thebody, line, where it is reflected along the vessels going to the small in- ^^^^l^^ testine, then over the intestine, and finally back to the spine along cus. the other aspect of the vessels. Lastly it may be pursued outwardsDISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 508 to the right colon, which it encircles like the left, and along the wall of the abdomen to the umbilicus. The membrane that fixes the colon on each side to the abdominal wall, is named meso-colon, and that attaching the small intestine is the mesentery. Con- Vertical circle or from above downwards.—Beginning at the liver, oTthe^ the student may perceive that the peritoneum covering it is pro- meiru lodged from the under surface of that viscus on the vessels. From fronf liver it may be followed along those vessels, one piece before above and the other behind them, forming the small omentum, to the down J ' upper border of the stomach. At the stomach the two pieces en- closing the vessels separate, one going before, and the other behind it; but beyond that viscus, they are applied to one another to form the great omentum or epiploon. After descending in con- tact in that fold to the lower part of the abdomen, they may be traced in it backwards and upwards, and may be seen to separate to enclose the transverse colon like the stomach, and then to continue to the spine, giving rise to the transverse meso-colon. At the attachment of the transverse meso-colon to the spine, the two companion pieces will be found to separate,^— one passing up- wards, the other downwards, forms ^* '^^^ ascending piece is continued in front of the pancreas and omen piUars of the diaphragm, and blends with the peritoneum on turn, the posterior aspect of the liver : in its ascent it forms the posterior part of a pouch, which is behind the stomach, and de- ^- The descending piece or layer may be followed from the trans- over^the "^^^^c meso-colon along the middle line of the spine, over the duo- to^the"^ denum and the great vessels on the spine (aorta and cava), till it pelvis, meets with the artery to the small intestine, along which it is continued to form the mesentery, as before explained in tracing the peritoneum in a circular direction. From the root of the mesen- teric artery the peritoneum descends to the pelvis, and partly covers the viscera in that cavity. Thus it surrounds the upper part of the rectum, and attaches this viscus to the abdominal wall by the meso-rectum ; next, it is continued forwards between the rectum and the bladder, or between the rectum and the uterus, where it forms a pouch; thence it passes from the pelvis over the back and sides of the bladder. Lastly, the serous membrane is continued to the inguinal region, where it presents the pouches before alluded to (p. 495.); and it can be traced upwards on the wall of the abdomen and the diaphragm to the rest of the membrane on the upper surface of the liver.

They are three in number: — one, small omentum, is at- tached to the upper curve; another, great omentum, to the lower curve; and the third, splenic omentum, is fixed to the great end of the viscus.

At the lower part of the abdomen Forms the fold is bent backwards, and returns towards the spine, fn^front the pieces of which it is composed separating and enclosing TnteT.^" the transverse colon as before seen. Between the layers of ' the peritoneum are contained some fat, and some vessels and nerves; and the power of separating the one from the other diminishes with the increase of the distance from the stomach, until at last they are not to be separated, and the membrane they form is thin and net-like.

If the iow\^"^^' t>ag of the omentum were perfect, it could be inflated througli the foramen ; or if it were detached from the surrounding parts, it could be drawn through the same hole into the general bag of the peritoneum. Supposing it to be detached and drawn out, the fol- lowing parts would have peritoneum taken from them, viz. the small omentum (posterior piece), the posterior part of the stomach, the great omentum (inner piece), the upper surface of the trans- verse colon, the pancreas and the spine, and the posterior part of the liver. Should this piece of peritoneum be removed, there is not any hindrance to the vessels reaching the dilFerent viscera; and it may be readily conceived how the detached membrane could be replaced over the viscera, and around the vessels without being perforated by them. Foramen ^. The/omme/i of Winslow is the space behind the small omen- lowi^^"^' t^^^? through which the bag of the omentum opens into the general cavity of the peritoneum. In front of it is the small omentum, and behind are the vena cava and the spine. Above it is the liver (lobulus Spigelii), and below is the duodenum. Should this hole be closed by inflammation, there might be a dropsical collection in either the bag of the omentum, or the general bag of the peri- toneum. Splenic The splenic omentum reaches froni tlie erreat end of the omen- ^ turn. stomach to the concave surface of the spleen, and does not consist usually of two strata or pieces, like the other omenta.

Each part of the colon has a separate meso-colon attaching it: thus there is an ascending, a transverse, a de- scending, and a sigmoid meso-colon: the caecum is also fixed by a meso-csecum, and the rectum by a meso-rectum. Meso- a. The meso-ccecum attaches the caecum to the right iliac fossa. Usually the peritoneum does not surround the caecum so as to form a fold behind it, but in some bodies the serous membrane does give a suspensory band to that part of the intestine. caecum.LIGAMENTS OF THE LIVER. 511 h.

By one side it is fixed to the colon, and by the other side to the abdominal wall below the pancreas. It is formed of two layers of peritoneum, as be- fore said, which enclose the vessels of the colon.

Examine Directions, — The vessels and nerves (mesenteric) that are seis to distributed to the alimentary tube, except to the upper and tine. the lower part, may be first dissected. After these have been examined, and the connections of the aorta and vena cava have been seen, the intestine can be taken out to give513 SUPERIOR MESENTERIC VESSELS. room for the display of the viscera in the upper part of the cavity. Mesenteric Vessels.—The mesenteric arteries (superior ve.seis and inferior) are two large visceral branches of the aorta, tlne!^^^" vc^hich supply the whole of the intestinal tube, except the duo- denum and the rectum. Each is accompanied by a vein, and by a plexus of nerves of the same name, derived from the sympathetic. Dissection.— For the dissection of the superior mesenteric pissec- vessels and nerves, the great omentum and the transverse superior colon are to be placed on the margin of the ribs, and one terk."" layer (anterior) of the mesentery is to be removed. Whilst tracing the branches of the artery to the small intestine, the student will meet with corresponding veins, and with offsets of the sympathetic nerves on the arteries. Some mesenteric glands and a few lacteal vessels will come into view at the same time. The branches from the right side of the vessel to the large intestine are to be next followed. After all the branches have been cleaned, the trunk of the artery should be traced back beneath the pancreas, and the plexus of nerves surrounding it should be defined. The superior mesenteric artery supplies branches to the s«pe. small intestine beyond the duodenal part, and to half the enteric artery. large intestine, viz. as far as the end of the transverse colon. Arising from the aorta near the diaphragm, the vessel is courses directed downwards between the layers of the mesentery,Ltinein where it forms an arch with the convexity to the leit side, entery. and terminates in offsets to the caecum and the end of the small intestine. At first the artery lies beneath the pancreas and the splenic vein; and as it descends to the connec- mesentery it is placed in front of the duodenum and the ^^^^^ left renal vein. This vessel is surrounded by the mesenteric plexus of nerves, and is accompanied by the vein of the same name. Branches.—Whilst the vessel is covered by the pancreas and ^ it gives a small branch to that body and the duodenum. Its es. other branches are intestinal; those from the left or convex side of the vessel (rami intes tin ales) supply the jejunum and the ileum; and those from the opposite side supply the colon, and are named colic arteries. The pancreaticO'duodenal branch (inferior) is of small ft^^^J^"514 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. duo-^ size, and after giving twigs to the pancreas, extends from left to right along the concavity of the duodenum, and ana- stomoses with the other duodenal branches. Branch- The intestinal branches to the jejunum and the ileum, are small about twelve in number, and pass from the left side of the une!" artery, between the layers of the mesentery, to their desti- Number nation. About two inches from their origin, or sooner, the range-' branches bifurcate, and the resulting branches unite with arches!*^ similar offsets from the collateral arteries so as to form a series of arches. From the convexity of those arches other branches take origin, which divide and unite in the same way. This process is repeated four or five times between the origin and the distribution of the arteries, but at each Distri- branching the size of the vessels diminishes. From the last bution ^ ^ on^the set of archcs, twigs are sent to the intestine ; these pass on both aspects of the tube, and anastomose round it, supplying its structure. ofVa^rg? ^^^^ branches to the large intestine are three in number, g"^- ileo-colic, right colic, and middle colic arteries. iieo-coiic a.

The superior mesenteric vein commences in that part of supe. the intestinal tube to which the artery is distributed, and its enteric' radicles unite into one trunk.

The peritoneum should be removed with care from it, and the branches should be traced outwards to the remaining half of the large intestine : a part of the artery enters the pelvis, but this will be afterwards dissected. On the artery and its branches is the inferior mesenteric plexus of nerves. The mesenteric vein is likewise to be followed upwards to its junction with the splenic, or with the supe- rior mesenteric vein. On the aorta the dissector will meet with a plexus of nerves which is to be left uninjured.

Left The left colic artery ascends in front of the left kidney, branch and dividos into ascending and descending branches for the descend. Supply of the descending colon. By the ascending offset it cofon. anastomoses with the middle colic branch of the superior mesenteric artery. Sigmoid The sigmoid artery is distributed to the sigmoid flexure. Passing almost transversely outwards, it divides into branches, which anastomose above with the preceding colic branch, to sig. and below with the hgemorrhoidal. Here, as in the rest of flexure, the intestinal tube, arches are formed by the arteries destined for the supply of the intestine. Branch The supcrior hcemorrhoidal artery enters between the turn. layers of the meso-rectum, and is distributed to the lower part of the great intestine : it will be described in the dis- section of the pelvis. Inferior The inferior mesenteric vein begins in the part of the inesen- teric great intestine to which its companion artery is distributed, and ascends along the psoas muscle, away from the artery, to open into the splenic vein beneath the pancreas. Occa- sionally it joins the superior mesenteric vein. Veins of The mesenteric veins are without valves, and may be in- without jected from the trunk to the branches like an artery. valves. Lymph- Lymphatic glands are found by the side of the descending glands, colon and the sigmoid flexure. The lymphatics from those parts, after passing through the glands, enter the left lumbar lymphatic glands. Some Sympathetic Nerve. — The following plexuses of the onhe^^^ sympathetic, which are derived from the solar plexus be- thetFc" neath the stomach, are in connection with the vessels that viscera, are now dissected, viz. superior mesenteric, aortic, spermatic, inferior mesenteric, and hypogastric.

By taking the peritoneum from the aorta between the mesenteric vessels,517 AORTIC AND MESENTERIC PLEXUSES. the aortic plexus will appear : from the upper part of this plexus an offset is to be followed along the spermatic artery ; this may be done, on the left side, where the vessel is partly laid bare. By removing the serous membrane from the front of the g/^J^j.^^'^" sacrum, and following downwards, over the iliac arteries, plexus, the nerves from the aortic plexus and the lumbar ganglia, the dissector will arrive at the hypogastric plexus of the pelvis. The superior mesenteric plexus is a large offset on the Supe- • ••111 rior mes- mesenteric artery and its branches, and is distributed to the enteric same extent of the intestinal tube as the vessel. The jg nerves surround closely the artery with a sheath, and are ofsame covered at first by the pancreas. In the mesentery, near the intestine, some of the nerves leave the arteries, and divide and communicate with others before entering the gut.

A short arterial trunk (coeliac axis) above the pancreas is not to be cleaned now, otherwise the nerves about it would be destroyed. The vena cava will be dissected at the same time as the aorta. The aorta enters the abdomen between the pillars of the Aorta diaphragm, and divides into iliac arteries opposite the left J^fdije side of the fourth lumbar vertebra. At the diaphragm the ^^^p'"^- vessel occupies the middle line of the spine, but it gradually inclines to the left as it descends. In the abdomen the aorta parts is covered at first by the solar plexus, and by the pancreas and the splenic vein ; still lower (beyond the superior me- senteric artery) by the left renal vein and the duodenum ; and thence to its termination by the peritoneum and the aortic plexus. The vessel lies on the lumbar vertebrae ; and to its right side is the vena cava. Its branches are furnished Branch, to the viscera and the wall of the abdomen, but these will be enumerated farther on.

It lies close the to the aorta, as far as the diaphragm, but above that spot it ascends on the right of the crus, and is imbedded in the except posterior part of the liver. Lastly, it leaves the abdomen by an aperture in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm, on the right of the aortic opening. The vena cava is joined Branch- by some branches from the abdominal viscera, and by others corresponding with the branches of the aorta that are sup- plied to the parietes of the abdomen. CONNECTIONS OF THE DUODENUM AND PANCREAS. Directions,— The situation, and the connections of the duodenum and pancreas should be next looked to. Dissection,— To see satisfactorily the duodenum and the Remove pancreas, the intestinal tube, beyond the duodenum, is to be removed in the following way: — one ligature is to be placed on the upper part of the jejunum, another on the lower end L L 4DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 520 of the sigmoid flexure of the colon, and the gut is to be cut through at the points at which it is tied. The detached piece of the intestinal tube can be taken away by cutting through the vessels and the peritoneum that connect it to the wall of the abdomen; after it has been separated, it is to be set aside for examination whilst the body is turned, to see To fit the remaining viscera for examination, the student denum," should moderately inflate the stomach and duodenum from the cut extremity of the latter; and whilst cleaning them, he should be careful of the vessels and nerves. On turning up- and pan- wards the stomach he will be able to trace the pancreas from creas. ^j^^ spleen on the one hand to the duodenum on the other ; and on raising the duodenum, to find the common bile duct between it and the head of the pancreas.

It makes a curve arouild the head ation!^^' of the paucrcas, and occupies the right hypochondriac, right lumbar, and umbilical regions of the abdomen : its peritoneal covering is incomplete and peculiar (p. 511.). From its s?on^' winding course around the pancreas it is divided into three parts —superior transverse, vertical, and inferior transverse. First The superior transverse part is free and moveable, like part IS ^ ^ , , shortest, the stomach ; it measures about two inches in length, and is and is o ^ move- directed from the pylorus to the neck of the gall bladder, ascending slightly in its progress from the one point to the other.

Projecting above the upper border, near borders, the centre, is the arterial trunk of the coeliac axis ; to the left of that vessel, along the same border, is the splenic artery, whilst to the right of it are the hepatic artery and the first part of the duodenum.

The veins corresponding with those vessels are collected into one trunk — the vena portas: and the nerves are supplied from the vagus and the sympathetic trunks. How to Dissection,— The vessels have been in part laid bare by previous dissection, and the preparation of them will be completed by the removal of the loose tissue and the peri- toneum from each. Before beginning this task the student should take care that the liver is well raised; and whilst completing it he should spare the plexuses of nerves that and its surround the vessels. Starting from the coeliac axis, he brinch- ^^^st follow to the left side the small coronary artery, and clear its branches to the oesophagus and the stomach. Next the hepatic artery, with the vena portae and the bile duct, may be traced to the liver and the gall bladder ; and a considerable branch of it should be pursued, beneath the pylorus, to the stomach, duodenum, and pancreas. Lastly, the splenic artery, which lies along the upper border of the pancreas, is to be cleaned, and its branches to the pancreas, stomach, and spleen defined. The veins will be dissected for the most part with the arteries, but the origin of the vena portae is to be made out beneath the pancreas. This The CCELIAC AXIS is the first visceral branch of the abdo- suppues iiiinal aorta, and arises from that vessel between the pillars fofiow?^ of the diaphragm. It is a short thick trunk, about half an brlnch- ^^^^ l^ng, which projects above the upper border of the ' — pancreas, and is surrounded by the nerves of the solar plexus of the sympathetic. Its branches — coronary, hepatic, and splenic,— radiate from the trunk (whence the name axis) to their distribution to the viscera in the upper part of the abdomen. coro- 1. The coronary/ artery is the smallest of the three wSh branches, and passes between the layers of the little omen- ^'^^^ tum to the left orifice of the stomach. At that spot it fur- nishes some oesophageal branches, and then turns from left to right, along the upper border of the stomach, to anastomose with a branch (pyloric) from the hepatic artery. Its offsets to the oesophagus and the stomach are thus distributed:— offsets to a. The cesophageal branches ascend on the gullet through523 BRANCHES OF THE CCELIAC AXIS. the opening in the diaphragm, and after supplying that tube, the ceso anastomose on it with branches from the thoracic aorta. p'^^s"^ The gastric branches are given to both sides of the ^^^^^^^ stomach as the artery lies along it, and those on the left end ™ach. communicate with twigs (vasa brevia) of the splenic artery. 2. The splenic artery is the largest branch of the coeliac spienic 1 1 1 T • 1 1 artery axis in the adult. It is a tortuous artery, and runs almost horizontally to the left, along the upper border of the pan- creas, to the spleen. Near this body it divides into its terminal branches {splenic), which are about six in number supplies (from four to ten), and enter the substance of the spleen by spleen, the concave surface towards the stomach. In its course the vessel is accompanied by the splenic vein, which is below it, and it distributes branches to the pancreas and the stomach. a. Pancreatic branches,— Numerous small branches are the pan- creas by supplied to the gland as the artery lies along it: and one of ^arge these, art, pancreatica magna, arises near the left end of the smaii gland, and runs to the right, with the duct, in the substance of the viscus. b. The branches for the stomach arise from the divisions and the of the artery near the spleen. Some of these, vasa brevia, by vasa turn upwards to the left end of the stomach, between or be- neath the gastro-splenic omentum, and ramify in the coats of that organ. Another branch, art, gastro-epiploica sinis- and left tra, which is larger than the others, turns to the right along epiploic, the great curvature of the stomach, between the layers of the great omentum, and inosculates with the right gastro- epiploic branch of the hepatic artery. This artery distri- butes twigs to both surfaces of the stomach, as well as others between the pieces of peritoneum forming the great omen- tum. 3. The hepatic artery is the largest, in the fetus, of the Hepatic three branches into which the coeliac axis divides ; but in the adult it is intermediate in size between the other two, and is encircled by the largest plexus of nerves. In its course to courses the liver, the vessel is first bent to the right towards the liver, small end of the stomach, where it supplies its principal branches (superior pyloric and gastro-epiploic). It then ascends between the layers of the little omentum, on the left side of the bile duct and the vena portae, and divides in which ^ it ends.524 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. near the transverse fissure of the liver into two large termi- and^sup- nal arteries — the right and left hepatic. Its branches are distributed not only to the liver, but freely to the stomach, the duodenum, and the pancreas, offsets^to a. The superior pyloric branch descends to the upper mach. border of the stomach, and running from right to left ana- stomoses with the coronary artery; it distributes small arte- rial twigs on both the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach. Branch- b. The right gastro-epiplo'ic branch"^ (art. gast. epiploica stomach, doxtra) is a trunk of considerable size, which descends be- duode- neath the duodenum near the pylorus, then turns from right viz.— to left along the great curvature of the stomach, between the pieces of the great omentum, and inosculates with the left gastro-epiploic branch of the splenic artery. On the sur- faces of the stomach, some offsets are given upwards, and others downwards between the layers of the omentum. It furnishes the following branches to the stomach, and the pancreas and the duodenum: — inferior Small inferior pyloric branches end in the small extremity of the stomach. and pan- The pancreatico-duodenal branch (superior) leaves the trunk diwde-"" opposite the duodenum, and runs along the curve of that intestine, lying between it and the pancreas ; it anastomoses below with the pancreatico-duodenal branch (inferior) of the superior mesenteric artery (p. 513.).

The superior coronary vein lies along the upper border of coronary the stomach. It begins in the oesophagus and the left part stomach; of the stomach, and joins the vena portae at the pylorus. The splenic vein is of large size, and is formed by the ^p'^"'^^^^ union of branches that issue from the spleen. It takes much spleen, the same course as the artery, but is lower than it, and runs beneath the pancreas to the front of the vena cava, where it joins the superior mesenteric vein to form the vena portse. Between its origin and termination it receives branches stomach, corresponding to the following arteries: vasa brevia, left crea&r" gastro-epiploic, and pancreatic ; it is also joined by the infe- rior mesenteric vein about the middle of its length.

This artery in vein commences by roots in the viscera above mentioned, branch- . ing. like any other vein; but it is deficient in valves, and ramifies through the structure of the liver in the same manner as an artery. Its radicles communicate with small systemic veins on some parts of the intestinal tube, more particularly on the rectum. The vein is formed by the union of the splenic and supe- ^^ ori- rior mesenteric veins (p. 515.); and its origin is placed in front of the vena cava, but beneath the pancreas and about two inches from the right end. This vessel is about four length, inches long, and is directed upwards in the small omentum, andter- behind the bile duct and the hepatic artery, to the transverse uon?" fissure of the liver, where it divides into a right and a left branch.

General SYMPATHETIC Nerve. — In the abdomcu the sympathetic tion in nerve consists, as in the thorax, of a gangliated cord on each domen. side of the vertebral column; and of prevertebral centres or plexuses, which furnish branches to the viscera. Two Two prevertebral plexuses are found in the abdomen, centres. One of thcsc is the solar or epigastric plexus, which is placed behind the stomach, and supplies nerves to all the viscera and hy- abovo the cavity of the pelvis. The other, or the hypogas- tric, trie plexus, is situate in the pelvis, and distributes nerves to the pelvic viscera. The offsets or the secondary plexuses of these centres accompany the bloodvessels to their destina- tion. Part to The visceral part of the sympathetic nerve that remains in the to be seen, consists of the great epigastric centre, viz. the men. solar plcxus and the semilunar ganglia, with their offsets. How to Dissection. — To denude the great prevertebral centre solar above mentioned, the following dissection is to be made : — plexus. ^1^^ ^.^ l^^g heen let out of the stomach and the duo- denum, the portal vein, the common bile duct, and the gas- tro-epiploic artery are to be cut through behind the pylo- rus ; and the stomach, the duodenum, and the pancreas are to be drawn over to the left side. On raising the liver, and taking away some fatty tissue, the vena cava appears: the vein is to be cut across above the junction of the renal527 SYMPATHETIC AND VAGUS NERVES. vein with it, and the lower end is to be drawn down with hooks. Beneath the vein the dissector will find the large reddish semi. lunar semilunar ganglion of the right side. From its inner part ganglia, he should trace the numerous nerves which form the solar plexus around the coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries ; and should unravel the offsets around those arteries, with their secondary plexuses. From the outer part of the gan- glion branches are to be traced to the kidney, the suprarenal body, and the diaphragmatic arteries. At its upper part the student may observe the large splanchnic nerve; and deeper than'it, one or two other smaller splanchnic nerves, which throw themselves into the solar and renal plexuses. Mixed up with the nerves of the solar plexus are numerous lymphatic glands and a dense tissue, which require to be removed with care. The student should then trace the ending of the pneumo- Follow gastric nerves on the stomach. The left nerve will be found ing of the in front near the upper border ; and the right nerve will ntfves. be seen at a corresponding point on the opposite aspect. Branches are to be traced from the right nerve to the plexus of the sympathetic by the side of the coeliac axis, and from the left to the hepatic plexus. The EPIGASTRIC or solar plexus is the largest of the soiar prevertebral plexuses of the sympathetic, and furnishes ^'^^"^» nerves to all the viscera of the abdomen above the pelvis. It is a large network of nerves and ganglia, which lies in appear- front of the aorta and the pillars of the diaphragm, and ex- tends from the suprarenal capsule of one side to that of the other. It surrounds the coeliac axis and the superior me- extent; senteric artery, and extends downwards to the pancreas. The plexus is connected on each side with the large and small splanchnic nerves, and it is joined also by some twigs from the right pneumo-gastric nerve. Large offsets are fur- gives ' nished to the different viscera along the vessels. onbiood The semilunar ganglia of the solar plexus, one on each g^^j, side, are the largest ganglia in the body. Each is situate at g^ngua; the upper and outer part of the plexus, close to the supra- renal capsule, and on the side of the pillar of the diaphragm, situa- The ganglion on the right side is beneath the vena cava. ^^^^^ Irregular in shape, the mass is sometimes oval, and at other528 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. times divided into smaller ganglia. From the outer side Nerves nerves are directed to the kidney and the suprarenal cap- edwith" sule, and to the inner side the cords of the solar plexus are * connected.

The splenic plexus surrounds the splenic artery, and is con- splenic, ducted by it to the substance of the spleen. It furnishes offsets, like the artery, to the pancreas, and other nerves to the stomach along the left gastro-epiploi'c artery. This plexus is joined by twigs from the left semilunar ganglion, and by an offset from the right pneumo-gastric nerve. c. The hepatic plexus is continued on the vena portse, the hepatic and artery, and the bile duct to the transverse fissure of the liver, ^^P^^'^* where it enters the liver and ramifies on the vessels. Whilst ascending in the small omentum, the plexus is joined on the left side by offsets from the left vagus and phrenic nerves. — (Swan.) Secondary plexuses are furnished around the branches of the The last hepatic artery, which have the same name and distribution as the se^co?d-^^ vessels. The following are these plexuses : — A pyloric plexus accompanies the pyloric artery to the upper pyloric, border of the stomach. There are two other plexuses —gastro- ^^^Jg" epiploic (right) and pancrentico-duodenal, corresponding with the "p^j^.^ branches of the artery : the former meets nerves Irom the splenic pancre- plexus, and the latter communicates with the superior mesenteric plexus on the end of the duodenum. A cystic plexus is distributed ^"d. ^ . , 1 cystic. to the gall bladder with its artery. The remaining oflfsets of the solar plexus, viz. superior and inferior mesenteric, aortic, and spermatic, have been already described (p. 516,517,518.); but the derivation of the superior mesenteric and aortic plexuses from the epigastric centre can be now seen. Ending of the splanchnic nerves.—The large nerve per- forates the crus of the diaphragm, and generally ends alto- spianch- gether in the semilunar ganglion, but it may give filaments nerve, to the renal plexus and the suprarenal body. The small small, nerve comes through the same opening in the diaphragm as the preceding, and ends in the coeliac plexus; but it enters the renal plexus if the smallest splanchnic nerve is absent. The smallest nerve, after piercing the diaphragm, joins the and renal plexus. Ending of the vagus nerve,—In the abdomen the pneumo- Ending gastric nerves end mostly in the stomach. The left divides vagus into branches, which extend over the front and along the small curvature of the stomach ; these join the sympathetic, and give offsets to the hepatic plexus. The right nerve is and distributed to the posterior surface of the stomach near the upper border, and communicates with its fellow, and with the coeliac and splenic plexuses.

This coat is a thickish layer, smooth and soft to the touch, which, in the natural and healthy condition, is found colour, of a pale rose colour soon after death. In infancy the na- tural redness is greater than in childhood or old age; but in the empty state of the stomach the membrane is less vas- cular than during digestion. When the stomach is con- foids, tracted, the membrane is thrown into numerous wavy lines or rugcB, which are longitudinal along the great curve, j thick- towards the pylorus.

SMALL INTESTINE. ch^arac- The three parts into which the small intestine is divided, viz. duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, have the following differences in their characters : — Length The duodenum measures about as much as the breadth of and fix- ^ • i edness. twelvo fingers, VIZ. about ten inches, and is more fixed than Width the rest of the intestinal tube.

The jejuniim and the ileum together are about twenty feet long, and are connected to the mesentery by one border. There is not any perceptible difference between the termi- Division nation of the one and the commencement of the other, but trary. two-fifths of tlio length are assigned to the jejunum, and Differ- thrco-fifths to the ileum. At their ends, however, a marked the ends, difference may be observed; for the upper part of the jejunum is thicker and more vascular than the lower part of the ileum, and its width is also greater. Wall has Structure.—In the small intestine the wall is formed strata as by the samo number of layers as in the stomach, viz. serous, mach. muscular, fibrous, and mucous; and these have the same position from within outwards. The different structures are to be examined on pieces taken from the duodenum, from the upper part of the jejunum, from the lower end of the ileum, and from the middle of the small intestine. After the pieces of intestine have been cut off, they are to be dis- tended with air. Serous 1. serous coat IS closely connected with the subjacent muscular layer. To the greater part of the small intestine (jejunum and ileum) it furnishes a covering, except at the like that attached part where the vessels enter: at this spot a space stomach, exists, resembling that at the borders of the stomach, where the peritoneum is reflected off to form the mesentery. The except peritoneum surrounds the duodenum only partly ; this pecu- duode- liarity has been described at p. 511. coatVALVULE CONNIVENTES. 535 M M 4 2.

In the upper part of the duodenum the student is to seek oiands some small compound glands,— those of Brunner, which are ne^"^""' imbedded in the submucous tissue. They lie beneath the mucous membrane, and will be seen shining through the fibrous layer, when the muscular coat has been taken away. The pieces of intestine may be opened and washed, to and show the mucous coat; but the gut should be cut along the ^at line of attachment of the mesentery, so as to avoid Peyer's glands on the opposite side. 4. Mucous coat,— The lining membrane of the small in- testine is thicker and more vascular at the beginning than ^hick- at the ending of the tube, and is marked also by numerous prominent folds (valvules conniventes).

Occupying the substance of the and mucous coat are numerous glands; and covering the whole Surface, is a columnar epithelium. The valvules conniventes (valves of Kerkring) are perma- yoUs or nent folds of the mucous membrane, which are arranged cir- armnge- cularly, one after another, along the intestine, and project into the alimentary mass. Crescentic in form, they extend length, round the intestine for half or two-thirds of its circle, and some end in bifurcated extremities. Larger and smaller size and folds are met with, sometimes alternating ; and the larger ^^^^^'DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 536 ones are about two inches long, with two-thirds of an inch formed depth towards the centre. Each valve is formed of a doubling of the mucous membrane, which encloses vessels between the layers. Extent The valves begin in the duodenum, about one or two intls- inches beyond the pylorus, and are continued in regular *^"^* succession to the middle of the jejunum; but beyond that point they become smaller, and more distant from one another, and finally disappear about the middle of the ileum, having previously become irregular and rudimentary. The valvulse are largest and most regular beyond, and not far from the opening of the bile duct. Opening The aperture of the common bile and pancreatic ducts is duct; a narrow orifice, from three to four inches from the pylorus, where and is situatc in a small prominence on the mucous mem- brane of the duodenum, at the inner and posterior part of the intestine.

Between the vesicles the lining membrane of the bowel has the same appearance as in other parts. Com- Glands of Brunner.—Directions have been already given glands, how to display these glands (p. 535.). They are small com- Brun. pound glauds, similar to the buccal and labial glands of the mouth, which exist only in the duodenum. Near the pylorus these bodies are most numerous, and there they are visible tornpo- without a lens, being nearly as large as hemp seed. When examined more minutely, the glands are found to consist of Aper-: lobules, witli appertaining little excretory tubes; and each their ends on the surface of the mucous membrane by a duct, whose aperture is slightly larger than the mouths of the con- tiguous crypts of Lieberkiihn. In the small secretory cells of the gland the epithelium is laminar. The epi- Epithelium, — The epithelial lining of the mucous mem- is CO- brane of the small intestine is of the columnar or cylindrical kind. For the villi it forms a very distinct covering of elongated or prismatic pieces; it sinks also into the crypts of Lieberkiihn, and gives them a lining. How to Dissection. — To show the connective tissue between the areolar coats of the intcstinc, a piece of the bowel turned inside out, is to be inflated forcibly; and to ensure the success of the attempt, a few cuts may be previously made here and there through the peritoneal coat. The air enters the wall of the intestine, where the peritoneal covering is wanting, and then spreads through the whole gut; but opposite the solitary glands and the patches of Peyer the mucous coat is more closely connected with the neighbouring structures, and the subjacent portion will not be distended with the air. The intestine may be examined when it is dry. Arteries; Vessels of the intestine. — The branches of arteries ramify in the submucous layer, and end in small twigs that form a network in the mucous membrane to supply the valves, the villi, and the glands. Opposite the patches of Peyer's glands the intestine is most vascular; and the vessels form circles veins; arouud the follicles, and supply offsets to them. The veins have their usual resemblance to the companion arteries, eritr^ The absorbents consist of a superficial longitudinal set539 FORM OF THE LARGE INTESTINE. (lymphatics), and of a deep transverse set (lacteals), which end in larger vessels in the mesentery. Beneath the patches of Peyer's glands the lymphatics form distinct plexuses. Structure of the bile duct. — The bile duct consists of a Two strong fibrous coat, with some muscular fibres, and of ant^iieiVie internal or mucous coat. Opening on the surface of the mucous membrane are two sets of glands; one set consists glands, of small single cells collected together, and the other glands have branched tubes. LARGE INTESTINE. The large intestine is the part of the alimentary canal Extent between the termination of the ileum and the anus. Its guf^;^ divisions, and the connection of these by peritoneum to the abdominal wall have been described (p. 503. 510.). In length length; this part of the alimentary canal measures about five or six feet, — one fifth of the extent of the whole intestinal tube. The diameter of the colon is largest at the commencement size; in the caecum, and gradually decreases from that part, as far as the rectum, where there is, however, a dilatation near the end. When compared with the small intestine^ the colon is found Com- to be distinguished by the following characters : — it is of w1th^ greater capacity, being in some parts as large again, and is sut, more fixed in its position. The laro^e intestine is also free ^^^^^"^^ ^ ^ ^ more from convolutions, except in the left iliac fossa, where it ^^^^» forms the sigmoid flexure. Instead of being a smooth cylin- coiled, drical tube, the colon is sacculated, and is marked by three saccu- longitudinal muscular bands, which alternate with as many witif rows of dilatations or small sacs.

It begins in the tail of the pancreas, where it presents a bifurcated extremity ; as it continues branch- onwards to the head of the gland, it receives many branches, and it finally ends by opening into the duodenum, either in termi. union with, or separate from the common bile duct (p. 536.). ' ' Of the tributary branches the largest is derived from the size and head of the pancreas. The duct measures from yV^^ turn tV^^ moh in diameter near the duodenum, and is formed of a fibrous and a mucous coat: the latter is lined by a cylindrical epithelium, and is provided with small compound glands in the duct and its largest branches.

Structure.— Enveloping the spleen are two coverings, Two a serous and a fibrous. The mass of the spleen is formed and' by a network of fibrous tissue, which contains in its meshes mSLi- the proper splenic substance, and the Malpighian cor-spleen, puscles. Throughout the whole mass the bloodvessels and the nerves ramify. No duct exists in connection with this organ. 1. The serous or peritoneal coat incases the spleen, cover- serous ing the surface, except at the hilus and the posterior border nefriy of the viscus. It is closely connected to the subjacent fibrous piiTe" coat. 2. The fibrous coat (tunica albuginea) gives strength to Fibrous the organ, and forms a complete case for it. At the fissure Ss on the inner surface, this investment enters the interior of prr'*^' the spleen with the vessels, to which it furnishes sheaths.

Dissection. — The spongy structure will come into view, interior by washing and squeezing a piece of fresh (bullock's) spleen spleen, under water, so as to remove the grumous looking material. The trabecular tissue forms a network through the whole and dis- interior of the spleen, similar to that of a sponge, which is joined on the one hand to the external casing and on the tisJuek other to the sheaths around the vessels. The fibrous pro- cesses are white, flattened or cylindrical, and average from TnlxlZ x^o th to ^Lth of an inch: they consist of fibrous and elastic ture!'"^' tissues. In animals muscular fibres are described as exist- ing in the processes (Kolliker).

The liver secretes the bile, and is the largest gland in the office of body. Its duct opens into the duodenum with that of the'""'"'''' pancreas. —Preparatory to examining the liver, the clean - vessels at the under surface should be dissected out. This se'son" proceeding will be facilitated by distending the vena port^ u'der with cotton wool, and the gall-bladder with air through its duct. The several vessels and ducts are then to be defined, and the gall-bladder to be cleaned. On following outwards the left branch of the vena portse to the longitudinal or antero-posterior fissure, it will be found connected anteriorly with the remains of the umbilical vein, and posteriorly with the remains of the ductus venosus. The liver is of a red-brown colour and firm consistence; colour, and weighs commonly in the adult from three to four pounds s'st^encf" (fifty to sixty ounces). Transversely the gland measures ^^^ght. from ten to twelve inches; from front to back between six Sent"'' and seven inches; and in thickness, at the right end, about three inches, but this last measurement must change with the spot examined. In its shape the liver is somewhat square ; and in form it Form differs at the surfaces, borders, and extremities ; it is also Zl^'^' marked by several lobes and fossjB, and by fissures which contain vessels.

This fissure or hilus is nearer portal, the posterior than the anterior border of the liver, and con- verse, tains the vessels, nerves, ducts, and lymphatics of the viscus. At its left end, it is united at a right angle with the longitu- dinal fissure. The longitudinal fissure extends from the front to the back of the liver between the right and left lobes. In the part anterior to the transverse fissure (fissure for the umbi- lical vein) is the remnant of the umbilical vein, which is called round ligament, and is oftentimes arched over by a piece of the hepatic substance (pons hepatis). In the part behind the transverse fissure (fissure for the ductus venosus) is a small obliterated cord that remains from the ductus venosus of the foetus. The fissure or groove for the vena cava is placed on the ° ^ -"^ the vena right side of the Spigelian lobe, and is frequently bridged over by the liver. If the cava be opened, the large hepatic veins will be seen entering it. FosscB. — On the under surface of the right lobe are these depressions: one for the gall-bladder, to the right of the square lobe; another for the colon, near the anterior part; and a third for the kidney, near the posterior part. Vessels of the transverse fissure.— The vessels Ivine: in Vessels ^ . ^ in the the transverse fissure, viz. vena portas, hepatic artery, and trans- duct, have the following disposition:— the duct is anterior, fissure; the portal vein posterior, and the artery between the other two. Hepatic duct — The duct that conveys away the bile, is formed by two branches; these issue from the liver, one branch- ing. from each lobe, and are soon blended in a common tube or hepatic duct. After a distance of one inch and a half, the hepatic duct is joined by the duct of the gall-bladder ; and the union of the two gives rise to the common bile duct. The hepatic artery is divided into two, one for each lobe, and its I branches are surrounded by nerves and lymphatics. The vena portce branches, like the artery, into two trunks for the same lobes, and gives an offset to the Spigelian lobe : its left branch is the longest.

Occasionally the ductus venosus is found more or less pervious. Glandu- Structure of the Liver.— The substance of the liver ture i^" consists of a collection of small secreting bodies, called by^two lobules or acini; together with a large proportion of vessels, which are concerned both in the production of the secretion and in the nutrition of the organ. The whole is surrounded by a fibrous and a serous coat. Serous 1. Scrous coat — The peritoneum invests the liver almost coat, completely, and adheres closely to the subjacent coat.

As thus observed, these bodies are about the size and size of a pin's head, and measure from -^Qth to xV^h of an inch InlT-J' in diameter. Closely massed together, each presents a dark central point, and is isolated from the surrounding ones by "lent. _ a stratum of connective tissue. By means of transverse and vertical sections of the lobules, their form will appear triangular on the exterior, but five or many sided in the in- terior of the liver. They are clustered around the smallest divisions (sublobular) of the hepatic vein, to which each is connected by a small twig issuing from the centre (intra- lobular vein), something like the attachment of the lamina to the stalk or petiole of a leaf. The part of each lobule in contact with the small sublobular vein, wants the cover- ing of areolar tissue that invests the other sides. To study the minute structure of these secretory elements Difficult of the hepatic substance, the student should have the differ- loimiel^ ent vessels of the liver minutely injected, and should be provided with a microscope. Constituents of the lobules.— Each lobule or elementary a lobuie piece of the liver is composed of hepatic secretory cells, which distinct are arranged in lines so as to leave intervals between them ; and is provided with a capillary network of vessels, and with radicles of an excretory duct.

These nucleated cells adhere together by their surfaces so as to form rows, with spaces between them, which radiate from the centre to the circumference : and this linear arrangement is oftentimes less regular at the outer third of the lobule. The cells are connected with the f^o'Jj^^itjj origin of the ducts, and are concerned in the secretion of the bile. Arrangement of the vessels, — The disposition of the seve- ^^^^^f' ral vessels is the following : The smallest branches of the '^^l^^^^- vena portce, after uniting in a circle around the lobule, v^z-^ where they are named interlobular, enter its substance, and port£e.552 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. ^ form therein a network of capillaries near the circumference, hepatic The hepatic vein occupies the centre of the lobule, and its vein, . . radicles communicate with the portal plexus; it issues from and^biie the basc of the lobule as the intralobular vein. The radicles of the hile duct are supposed to form a plexus in the lobule; connected with these are the secretory hepatic or biliary cells that produce the bile. The roots of the bile duct leave the lobule at its circumference, and are joined in an inter- lobular plexus outside it, like the portal vessels. Use of From the facts above stated respecting the arrangement seis.^^^" of the vessels, it appears that the portal capillaries conduct the blood from which bile is secreted; that the hepatic vein carries back the superfluous blood; and that the secreted bile is conveyed away by the branches of the biliary duct. Arrange. VESSELS OF THE LiVER. TwO SCtS of VCSSCls ramify in ment of „ i«i vessels the livcr : — One set, concerned m the secretion and the in the . . p , liver, nutrition 01 the organ, enters the transverse fissure, and is directed transversely in spaces named portal canals, where it is enveloped by areolar tissue, the capsule of Glisson. The other set, or the hepatic veins, is without a sheath, and runs from the anterior to the posterior border of the liver: it conveys to the vena cava the blood that has been circu- lated through the organ. The ramifications of these difie- rent vessels are to be traced in the liver. Capsule The capsule of Glisson is a layer of areolar tissue, that son, with envelopes the vessels entering the liver through the trans- in trans- vcrsc fissurc. In this sheath the vessels ramify, and in it fissure: they are minutely divided before their termination in the invest- lobules. Proccsscs of the sheath accompany the small in- sheath terlobular vessels, and join the covering of the lobules. If to the a transverse section is made of a portal canal, the vessels will retract somewhat into the loose surrounding tissue. Vena The vena portce ramifies in the liver like an artery, and the porta yood is circulated through it in the same manner, viz. from trunk occupies to branches. After entering the transverse fissure the vein divides canafs, into primary [^branches; these lie in the portal canals or spaces with offsets of the hepatic artery, the hepatic duct, and the nerves and and lymphatics. The same division is repeated again and again; and vaginal* the resulting vessels give off* minute lateral branches, some of which, vaginal^ ramify in the loose sheath before their final dis- tribution to the hepatic substance, whilst others pass to the lobules and in- without previous anastomosis. Finally, the last branches of theTHE GALL-BLADDER. 553 vein penetrate between the lobules, around which they form a teriobu- circle, and then end in the interior as before explained: where If/anch- these twigs lie between the lobules they are named interlobular. Hepatic duct. — The commencement of the duct within the Bile lobules is uncertain; but probably the duct has a reticular arrange- ment amongst the portal vessels, its radicles corresponding to the spaces between the rows of cells, and being lined by a thin membrane. On leaving the lobules the branches form a plexus, interlobular, between them; and the small ducts soon unite into larger vaginal branches, that lie in the portal canals with the other vessels. Lastly, the ducts are collected into a right and a left trunk, which leave the liver at the transverse fissure as before described. Ducts have been found in the left lateral ligament of the liver, Some between the layers of the peritoneum; they anastomose together in the and are accompanied by branches of the vessels of the liver, viz. \igll^^ vena portae, hepatic artery, and hepatic vein. "^^"^ The hepatic artery is consumed in the nutrition of the structure Hepatic of the liver. Whilst surrounded by the capsule of Glisson it fur- nouSh- nishes vaginal branches to that sheath, which ramify in it and give ffygr^ it a red appearance in a well injected liver; it supplies other twigs and joins to the coats of the vena portas and the biliary duct. From the p^^^^ • vaginal branches some few offsets are sent to the lobules to supply their structure. This artery is supposed by Mr. Kiernan to ter- minate in venous capillaries that communicate with the branches of the vena portae. The hepatic veins (venae cavae hepaticse) begin by a plexus in the Hepatic interior of each lobule, and from it an intralobular vein issues at without the base; these join together and form still larger or sublobular ^^^^^^^ branches. The next sized branches cease to receive any intra- lobular twigs, and merely unite with neighbouring branches to produce larger veins. Finally, the hepatic veins are collected into begia large trunks, that are directed from before backwards to the vena lobules, cava inferior, into which they open by large orifices. The venae and end cavae hepaticse may be said to be without a sheath, for this is very vena^ slight only in the larger trunks : so that when they are cut across the ends remain patent in consequence of their close connection Avith the hepatic structure. THE GALL-BLADDEK. The gall-bladder is the receptacle of the bile, and is situate use and in a depression on the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, to the right of the square lobe. Conical in form, or ^^^^. pear-shaped, its larger end (fundus) is directed forwardsDISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 554 beyond the margin of tlie liver; whilst the smaller end, or the neck, is turned in the opposite direction, and bends size; downwards to end in the cystic duct by a zigzag part. In length the gall-bladder measures three or four inches, and in breadth rather more than an inch at the fundus, or the widest connec. part. It liolds rather more than an ounce. By one surface the sac is in contact with the liver, and on the opposite it is covered by peritoneum. The larger end touches the abdo- minal wall opposite the tip of the cartilage of the tenth rib, and is contiguous to the transverse colon ; and the small end touches the duodenum. struc. Structure, — The wall of the gall-bladder has a peritoneal, wall. a fibrous and muscular, and a mucous coat, with thin inter- vening layers of connective tissue. Serous The serous coat is stretched over the under or free aspect coat. ^ of the gall-bladder, and surrounds the large end when the viscus is distended. Fibrous The muscular coat^ which has not great strength, gives a muscu. complete covering to the sac, and has much areolar tissue stratum, intermixed with it. Mucous The mucous coat is marked internally by numerous ridges is^areo- and intervening depressions, which give an areolar or honey- surface, comb appearance to the surface. On laying open the gall- bladder this condition will be seen, with the aid of a lens, to be most developed about the centre of the sac, and to dimi- nish towards each extremity. In the larger hollows, there and CO- are other smaller depressions which lead to mucous follicles. vered by a coium.

Duct of The cystic duct joins the hepatic duct at an acute angle, bladder, to form the ductus communis choledochus. It is about an inch and a half long, and is distended and somewhat saccu- lated near the gall-bladder, struc Structure,— The coats of the duct are the same as those ture same as of the sac from which it leads, but the muscular fibres are sac, and is very few. The mucous lining is provided with branched with'^^'^ glands, as in the hepatic and common bile ducts (p. 539.)» glands.FORM OF THE KIDNEY. 555 But in the hepatic ducts the glands are arranged in a row on each side. Valve of the gall-bladder. — On slitting open the duct the Mucous T . , n • p •! coat like mucous membrane is seen to lorm a series oi semilunar pro- a screw, jections (from nine to twenty), which are arranged obliquely around the tube, like the thread of a screw, and increase in size towards the gall-bladder. This structure is best seen on a gall-bladder that has been inflated and dried; as in this state the parts of the bladder between the folds are most dis- tended, giving rise to the sacculated appearance. Bloodvessels and nerves.—The vessels of the ffall-bladder are Artery, named cystic ; the artery is a branch of the hepatic, and the vein vein, opens into the vena porta3 near the liver. The nerves are derived nerves, from the hepatic plexus, and entwine around the vessels. The lymph- lymphatics follow the cystic duct, and join the deep lymphatics on the spinal column. THE KIDNEY AND THE URETER. The organ for the secretion of urine has a characteristic Use and form : flattened on the sides, it is larger at the upper than form, at the lower extremity, and is hollowed out at the inner part of its circumference. For the purpose of distinguishing Todis- between th6 right and left kidneys, let the excavated margin right*^^ be supposed to be turned to the spinal column, whilst the left^ ureter, or the excretory tube, is kept more posterior than the other vessels ; and let that end be directed downwards, towards which the ureter is naturally inclined. With the special form above mentioned, the kidney is of colour, a deep red colour, and presents an even surface. Its average size, length is about four inches, its breadth two, and its thickness about one inch ; but the left is commonly longer and more slender than the right kidney. The usual weight of this and body is about five ounces and a half in the male, and rather less in the female. The upper extremity of the kidney is rounded, is thicker ^xtre- than the lower, and is surmounted by the suprarenal body ; the lower end is flat, and more pointed. The relative posi- tion with respect to the spinal column has been before detailed (p. 506.). On its anterior aspect the kidney IS surfaces; convex, but on the opposite surface it is flattened. The borders, outer border is convex ; but the inner is excavated, and is556 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. marked by a longitudinal fissure, hilum. In the interior of the kidney is a hollow, named sinus, into which the hilum leads, and in which the vessels and the duct are contained before they pierce the renal substance. Contents In the fissure of the kidney the several vessels are thus fissure : placod with rcspcct to one another: — The divisions of the their: renal vein are in front, the ureter is behind, and the branches position. artery lie between the other two. On the vessels the nerves and lymphatics ramify, and connective tissue and fat surround the whole. Open the Dissection, — To examine the interior it will be necessary and"^^' to cut through the kidney from the inner to the outer vessels, bordcr, and to remove the loose tissue from the vessels, and the divisions of the excretory duct that enter the hilum. The hollow, or sinus, that contains the bloodvessels^ now comes into view. Renal The interior of the kidney appears on a section to consist stance of two difiereut materials, viz. of an external granular or into cor- cortical part I and of internal, darker coloured, pyramidal pyrami- masscs, which couvcrgc towards the centre, and are con- nected with the divisions of the excretory duct. But it will subsequently appear that each of these parts is constructed of the same elements, though somewhat difierently arranged. Extent The cortical substance, or the external part, forms about tical sub- three-fourths of the kidney ; it covers the pyramidal masses with a layer about two lines in thickness, and sends prolon- coiour; gatious between the same nearly to their extremities. Its colour is of a light red, unless the kidney is blanched ; and consist^ its consistence is so slight that the mass gives way beneath ^"^^' the finger. This layer is formed of a congeries of convo- compo. luted uriniferal tubes, surrounded by vascular plexuses; and, sition. . . . ' . ... I in a well-injected specimen, red points (Malpighian bodies) are scattered here and there through its texture. Pyra- The pyramidal masses (pyramids of Malpighi, medullary number ^ubstance,) are twelve or eighteen in number, and converge form, ' to sinus of the kidney. Each mass is conical in form: rection \i2i^Q turned towards the circumference of the organ, where it is surrounded by the cortical substance ; and the apex, which is free from cortical covering, directed to the hollow at the inner part of the kidney. At this last spot it end in euds in a smooth, rounded part, named mamilla or papilla, papilla. '557 STRUCTURE OF THE KIDNEY. and is surrounded by one of the divisions (calyx) of the excretory tube. Occasionally two of the masses are united in one papillary termination. This portion of the kidney is Physical denser than the cortex, its colour is darker, and its cut sur- ters; face has a grooved appearance. The conically-shaped mass composi. is constructed of uriniferal tubes, like the cortical covering ; but in it the tubes have become straight, and are converging to their termination on the papilla. If the mass is com- pressed, urine will exude from the tubes, through apertures in the apex. In the human foetus, and in some animals, the kidney is divided Rudi. into separate lobes; and each lobe consists of a pyramidal mass, condi!^^ with a cortical envelope. With the growth of the human kidney tliT the original divisions disappear, and the cortical covering of con- ^^^"^y- tiguous lobes is blended to produce the interlobular cortical part. But in the adult the uriniferous tubes and the vessels of each pyra- mid and its envelope, which correspond with one of the primary lobes, are distinct as in the organ in its lobular condition. Structure of the Kidney. — The substance of the secre-' kidney consists of a mass of minute secretory tubes, inter- tSsare mixed with bloodvessels, lymphatics, nerves, and fine con- by f nective tissue. The whole is incased by a fibrous coat. coaT"^ The fibrous coat is a white firm case, which is connected Fibrous ' coat with the renal tissue by fine processes and vessels, but is readily detached from it by slight force. At the inner mar- sends in gin of the kidney it sinks into the hollow or sinus, and sends processes on the entering vessels : at the same spot it is continuous with the fibrous coat of the excretory duct. To obtain a knowledge of the anatomy of the secreting How the tubes, and to make out the disposition of the bloodvessels, to^be ^ the dissector will require a microscope and good fine injec- tions of the part. Arrangement, — The uriniferous tubes (tubuli uriniferi) Urini. are the ramified terminations of the excretory duct, which tubes;; pour out the urine. In the cortex of the kidney, where the charac- tubes present closed extremities (tubes of Ferrein), they are cortege innumerable, are very convoluted, and of different sizes, ney; convo- though they average about -g^^o^th of an inch. In this part luted, they are closely surrounded by a plexus of bloodvessels, and ^^^"^^^^ communicate freely with one another. A certain number of seis; the tubes converge towards each pyramid, and having be- in pyra- come straisrhtj are directed downwards, as a conical bundle, straight.558 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. to the apex of that body, where they open by somewhat fewer in dilated oHfices. In the pyramid the tubes lie close together, number i p , -,. and ves- and havo but few vessels between them; they lurther dimi- nish in number, from base to apex, by repeated unions, and open are enveloped by a uniting or parenchymatous structure. inferior- Qu a scction of oue of the pyramids, near the lower end, the number of tubes was estimated by Krause at a hundred in a square line. struc- Structure and ending of the tubes, — The tubes consist of the^vaii a thin special membrane; and they are lined by an epithe- hnie^' lium of the spheroidal kind, which forms three-fourths of the thickness of the wall, except in the pyramid, where it is special thinner, and the cells smaller and flatter. At the termi- brane natiou of the tubes in free extremities each tube presents a theiiura". dilated or saccular part, which contains a small vascular Malpighian body, and is perforated by the two vessels con- nected with that body.* Into this little sac the epithelial lining extends, and becomes very delicate and translucent. Dilatations for the lodgment of the Malpighian bodies are connected with the sides, as well as the ends of the tubes. Corpus- The Malpighian corpuscles (glomeruli of Ruysch) are t!fe small, rounded or oblong vascular bodies, which are contained tubules. dilated sacs of the uriniferal tubes. Each little vas- size; cular tuft has commonly a diameter of inch, and compos. IS formed by the capillary ramifications of two small vessels vessels, that perforate the end of the containing tube. One vessel (afferent) is a small twig of the renal artery, which forms the exterior of the tuft by its branchings; the other (efferent) occupies the centre of the tuft, and issuing from the tube ends in the plexus on a neighbouring uriniferal tube. This capillary body is free in the cavity of the tube that secretes the urine, but it is covered by some nucleated scales. Blood- Bloodvessels.—The artery and vein that are distributed Ire^^^ to the kidney are very large in proportion to the size of the inTar ^^g^^ ^^^7 uourish ; and some small arterial branches have Irepecu ^ Peculiar disposition in the Malpighian bodies before they liar. become capillary, and end in the veins. * See a Paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1842, Part I., On the Structure and Use of the Malpighian P>odies of the Kidney, by W. Bowman, r.R.S.THE URETER. 559 Renal artery,— As the artery enters the kidney it divides into branch- four or five branches, which are invested by sheaths of the fibrous artery capsule, and are transmitted to the cortical substance between the pyramidal masses. Some of the offsets of a chief branch enter the reach pyramidal mass, and ramify on the tubes, forming anastomotic loops parallel with those tubes, whilst the continuation of the supply trunk is distributed in the cortex around the pyramid. The ter- and form minal twigs of the artery end either in the Malpighian bodies or in a vascular plexus around the uriniferal tubes. Benal vein. — This vein begins in the capillary plexuses on the Veins convoluted urine tubes, and its larger branches are directed to the around centre of the kidney, where they communicate around the pyra- midal masses. From this spot the divisions of the vein accom- pany those of the artery, and are united finally into one trunk that and end opens into the vena cava. Some of the small roots of the vein Sva!"^ may be seen to form an arborescent appearance on the surface of the kidney. The URETER is the tube by which the fluid secreted in the Ureter;; kidney is conveyed to the bladder. Its relative anatomy must be studied afterwards, when the body is in a suitable position. Between its origin and termination the duct length. ; measures from sixteen to eighteen inches in length. Its size size corresponds commonly with that of a large quill; but near the kidney it is dilated into a funnel-shaped part, named pelvis, and near the bladder it is again somewhat dilated, though the lower aperture, by which it terminates, is the narrowest part of the tube. In its course from one viscus to another, the ureter is close course beneath the peritoneum, and is directed obliquely downwards and inwards along the posterior wall of the abdomen as far as the pelvis, where it becomes almost horizontal in direction in the posterior false ligament of the bladder. At first the and con- ureter is placed over the psoas muscle, inclining on the right side towards the inferior vena cava; and then it lies over the common or the external iliac artery *, being situate be- tween the vessel and the sigmoid flexure on the left side, and between that artery and the end of the ileum on the right side. Lastly, it will be subsequently seen to lie in the posterior ligament of the bladder, below the level of the * In a dozen uninfected bodies that were examined for me by Mr. S. r; Statham, the ureter was found as frequently over the one as the other of the two vessels mentioned.560 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. obliterated hypogastric artery. About the middle of the psoas this excretory tube is crossed by the spermatic ves- Some. gels. Sometimes the ureter is found divided into two for times double, a certain distance. Ureter Part in the kidney,—Near the kidney the ureter is dilated near the into a pouch, named pelvis^ in the hilum; and when traced upwards into the viscus^ it is found to begin by a set of cup- caiices, shaped tubes, named calices, or infundibula, which vary in which number from seven to thirteen. Each cup-shaped part em- pyra- braccs the rounded end of a pyramidal mass, and receives the urine that flows through the apertures in that projection ; and sometimes a calyx surrounds two or more papillse. The several calices are united together to form two or three larger tubes; and these are finally blended in the excretory duct or the ureter. Two Structure, —The ureter consists of an external or muscu- coats m ureter, Ja^^ and an internal or mucous coat. The muscular covering iTr is composed of an external or longitudinal, and an internal mucous. circular stratum. The mucous coat is thrown into longi- tudinal folds during the contracted state of the ureter, and is lined by an epithelium of the spheroidal form. The ca. The caliccs resemble the rest of the duct in having a mus- two^ cular and a mucous coat. Around the pyramid the enve- loping tunic of the kidney is continuous with the calyx ; and at the apex of that body, the mucous lining is prolonged into the uriniferal tubes through the small openings in the papilla. THE SUPRARENAL CAPSULE. Useun. This Small body, whose use is unknown, has received its known. ^ . . . ^ name from its position m the abdomen.

Some areolar tissue attaches the suprarenal body to the f?^^^^^- kidnej, and large vessels and nerves retain it in situation. The connections with the surrounding parts are the same as those of the upper end of the kidney. Thus this body rests on the diaphragm on both sides ; whilst above the right one is the liver, and above the left the pancreas and the spleen. On the inner side of the right capsule is the vena cava, with part of the solar plexus ; and internal to the left is the aorta, with the same plexus of nerves. Structure.— By means of a perpendicular section, the a cap. ^ ^ ^ ^ sule sur- suprarenal body will be seen to be formed of a firm external rounds or cortical part, and of an internal soft and dark material. The whole is surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule, that sends processes into the interior and along the bloodvessels. Twodif- With the aid of a microscope, the nature of the two materials struc- above noticed will be found to be as below stated : — viz.— The cortical part is yellowish in colour and striated. Its a corti- ' stroma is formed of fine connective tissue which builds up which spaces elongated from without inwards for the lodgment of oftu. the special structure. Its ultimate elements consist, ac- cording to Mr. Simon, of very small closed bodies or tubes, about y^th of an inch in diameter, which are arranged ver- tically around the central part, and surrounded by blood- vessels. In these fine microscopic tubes there are contained bodies like nuclei, together with nucleated granular cells, granules, and particles of oil. The central soft part is of a grayish colour, or rather red, and a or of a black or dark brown hue from bloodvessels; it is vascSar formed chiefly of a plexus of minute veins with some ele- ments similar to those in the cortical part. In the interior of the mass there is a space, apparently from breaking down of the interior parts. Bloodvessels.—Numerous branches of arteries are furnished to Arteries, the suprarenal body from the diaphragmatic and renal arteries, and from the aorta. In the interior of this body the arteries end in capillary plexuses 'that surround the small tubes above described. The veins originate in the plexuses on the tubes, and the several Veins, branches are collected into a trunk which opens on the right side mto the vena cava, and on the left, into the renal vein. O O562 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. THE TESTES. Testes The testes are two glandular organs for the secretion of situated -i i i • i -r^ i • in the the semen, and are lodged m the scrotum.

A serous sac surrounds partly each organ. To see Dissection. — For the purpose of examining the serous serous covcring of the testicle (tunica vaginalis), make an aperture into it and inflate it. The surface of both the sac and the spermatic cord are then to be cleaned, and the vessels of the latter are to be followed to their entrance into the testicle. Serous The tuTiica vaginalis is a serous bag, which is continuous with the peritoneal lining of the abdomen in the foetus, but becomes subsequently a distinct sac, in consequence of the partly obliteration of the tube that connected the two.

Size and weight. — In length the testis is an inch and a Dimen. half or two inches; from before backwards it measures rather more than an inch; and from side to side rather less than an inch. Its weight is nearly an ounce, and the left is frequently larger than the other. Structure.—The substance of the testicle is composed of a dense a mass of minute secerning tubes, around which the blood- conjains vessels are disposed in plexuses. Surrounding and support- '^crL ing the delicate seminiferal tubes is a dense covering of the tuL. j tunica albuginea. Its excretory or elFerent duct is named vas deferens. Dissection. — With the view of examining the investing How to fibrous coat, let the testis be placed on its outer side, viz. stTuSSre that on which the epididymis lies, and be fixed in that posi- tlsus' tion with pins. The fibrous coat may then be cut through along the anterior part, and raised as far backwards as to the entrance of the bloodvessels: in this proceeding a number of fine bands will be seen traversing the substance of the testicle, and a short septal piece (mediastinum) will be observed at the back of the viscus, where the vessels enter. It will be necessary to remove part of the testicular mass of tubes, to bring into view the mediastinum, and to trace back some of the finer septa to it. The tunica albuginea, or the fibrous coat of the testicle. Fibrous IS of a bluish-white colour, and resembles in appearance and structure the sclerotic coat of the eye-ball. This membrane ters?'* supports the soft glandular part of the testicle, and main- use. tarns the shape of the organ by reason of its dense and un- yielding nature. Besides determining the general form, it sends inwards processes to support and separate the seminal sends tubes. These several ofi-sets of the membrane are seen in To-'^' the dissection that has been made ; and one of them, which is ''''''' larger than the rest, is placed at the back of the testicle, and is named mediastinum. The mediastinum testis (corpus Highmorianum) projects ^re'm564 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. diasti. into the gland for the distance of a few lines with the blood- and" vessels. It is situate at the back of the testis, extending from the upper nearly to the lower part, and is larger and deeper above than below. When cut across it will be seen to be formed of two lateral pieces, which are united anteriorly at an acute angle : to its front and sides the finer septal processes are connected; and in its interior are contained the bloodvessels, and a network of seminal ducts forming the rete testis. finer Qf t\iQ finer processes of the tunica albuginea, which enter the testis, there are two kinds : those of one set are round, cord-like, but of different lengths, are fixed posteriorly to the mediastinum, and serve to maintain the shape of the testis ; those of the other, form delicate membranous septa, which divide the seminal tubes into masses named lobes, and are continued, like the rest, to join the mediastinum.

Thus, where the tubules are collected into separate masses, they form the lobes of the testis ; as they enter the fibrous mediastinum they become straight and are named tubuli recti; where they communicate in the mediastinum, they produce the rete testis ; and, lastly, as they leave the upper part of the gland, and become convoluted, they are called coni vasculosi, or vasa eiferentia. The lobes of the testis are formed, as above explained, by They bundles of the seminiferal tubes, and are situate in the inter- lobes, vals between the processes sent inwards from the tunica albuginea. The number of these is differently stated: ac- Number cording to one authority (Berres) they are 250: but according "^^^'^^^» to another (Krause), 400 or more. They are conical in form, form, with the base of each turned to the circumference, and the apex to the mediastinum testis. Each is made up of one, Tubes in two, or more tortuous seminal tubules; and the tubes in one arrange- lobe are sometimes united with those in the neighbouring lobes. Towards the apex of each lobe the tubules become less bent, and are united together ; and the tubuli of the several lobes are further joined at the same spot into larger canals that form the tubuli recti. Tubuli recti.— The seminal tubes that issue from the Tubes several lobes unite together, becoming larger in size and come^^" straighter in direction, and are named tubuli recti or vasa (tubui!^ recta: they are about twenty in number, and pierce the ^^^^^^' fibrous mediastinum, entering into its interior. Rete testis. — In the substance of the mediastinum the tubes lose their former name, and are directed to the upper end of the testis. They are situate in the anterior part of after- that fibrous process, in front of the bloodvessels, and freely join to- communicate, so as to form a network, the rete testis. frete Vasa efferentia. — About twelve or twenty seminal tubes issue from the top of the rete testis, and leave the upper part of the testicle as the vasa efferentia.

This present; body is convoluted, and projects upwards for two or three tion and inches amongst the vessels of the cord. Like the epididymis, it is much longer when it is unravelled, measuring sometimes fourteen inches, but it may not exceed an inch and a half in length. Its capacity is greatest at the free end. Its use is unknown. The vas aberrans may be found divided or doubled. Structure, — The excretory duct of the testis is formed Two chiefly by a thick, muscular coat; this is covered externally form the by areolar tissue, and lined internally by mucous membrane. To the feel the duct is firm and wiry, like whip-cord; and on a section its wall is dense and of a rather yellow colour, but it is thinnest at the head of the epididymis. The muscular coat a muscu- is composed of longitudinal and circular fibres arranged in strata, so that both externally and internally is a longitu- dinal layer, the latter being very thin ; and between them is a layer of circular fibres. The mucous membrane is and a mucous. marked by longitudinal ridges in the straight part of the canal, and by irregular ones in the sacculated portion. A columnar epithelium covers the inner surface. The canal of the vas deferens is larger than that of the Vas . in rm 1 aberrans epididymis, as before stated. The vas aberrans resembles like the duct. the vas deferens in structure. Bloodvessels and nerves of the testicle. — The branches of the Artery. spermatic artery pierce the back of the testis, and enter the posterior part of the mediastinum, behind the rete testis. Leaving the mediastinum, the vessels are finely divided in the vascular mem- brane that lines the interior of the tunica albuginea. After being thus divided, offsets are continued on the fine septa between the lobes to the seminal tubules, on which they are distributed. The spermatic veins begin in the plexuses around the seminal tubes, and Veins, issue from the gland at the posterior part: they then ascend along the cord, forming a plexus, and end in one trunk ; that on the right side joins the vena cava, and that on the left, the renal vein (p. 577.). The lymphatics ascend on the bloodvessels, and join the Lymph- lumbar glands. The nerves are derived from the sympathetic, and nerves, accompany the arteries to the testis.DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 568 Vessels Vessels of the vas deferens.— A special bloodvessel, the artery of ductf '^^^ deferens^ is furnished to the excretory duct from the upper vesical artery; and some veins from the epididymis enter the sper- matic veins.

Dissect Directions, — After the body is replaced in its former posi- vesseis tioii OH the back, the student should prepare first for exa- muscies. mination the diaphragm, next the large vessels and their branches, and then the remaining deep muscles of the abdo- men.

Whilst cleaning the surface the student should be careful of the vessels and the nerves on or towards the pillars. On the right side two aponeurotic bands or arches, which give attachment to the muscular fibres, should be dissected out: — one curves over the psoas muscle ; and the other extends from the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra to the last rib. Dia- The DIAPHRAGM forms the vaulted moveable partition situa- ^ between the thorax and the abdomen ; it is fleshy externally, form, where it is attached to the surrounding ribs and the spinal Origin column, and has its tendon in the centre. The origin of the circum- musclc is at the circumference, and is similar on each side of the middle line. Thus, beginning in front and passing backwards, the diaphragm is connected by fleshy fibres with the posterior part of the xiphoid cartilage, and with the inner aspect of the six lower ribs ; with two aponeurotic arches between the last rib and the vertebrae, — one being placed over thequadratus lumborum, and the other over the psoas muscle ; and, lastly, it is connected with the lumbar inser- vcrtcbrae by a thick muscular part or pillar. From this of fibres extensive origin externally, the fibres are directed inwards, central with different degrees of obliquity and length, to the central tendon, j^g^j^^^ tcndon, but some have a peculiar disposition in the pillars which will be afterwards noted.THE DIAPHRAGM. 569 The abdominal surface is concave, and is covered for the Parts in most part by the peritoneum: in contact with it, on the w.thThe right side, are the liver and the kidney; and on the left side, surface, the stomach, the spleen, and the left kidney: in contact also with the pillars is the pancreas, together with the solar plexus and the semilunar ganglia. The thoracic surface IS and with covered by the pleura and the pericardium, and is convex upper, towards the thorax (p. 396.). At the circumference of the muscle, the fleshy processes of origin alternate with like parts of the transversalis muscle: a slight interval separates Attach- the slips to the xiphoid cartilage and the seventh rib ; and border, a second interval sometimes exists between the fibres from the last rib, and those from the arch over the quadratus lumborum muscle. In the diaphragm are certain apertures Aper. . for the transmission of parts from the thorax to the abdomen, the muscle, viz. one for the oesophagus, another for the vena cava, and a third for the aorta between the pillars of the muscle and the spinal column: moreover, the pillars are perforated by the splanchnic nerves. The muscle is curved across the intercostal space, being Arch, convex towards the chest, and concave to the abdomen; and the arch reaches higher on the right than the left side (p. 342.). The height of the arch is constantly varying with Height the change in the condition of the diaphragm in respiration, expira!^ being carried upwards or downwards from the average level. In forced expiration the muscle ascends and reaches the upper border of the fourth rib on the right, and the fifth rib on the left side.

The following parts, that have been mentioned incidentally special T . , T , , parts to m describing the diaphragm, are now to be noticed more be ex- « T, , 1 -I 1 amined- lully ; they are the central tendon, the pillars, the arches, and the apertures. The central tendon (tendo diaphraffmatis, cordiform ten- central . . tendon, don), occupying the middle of the diaphragm, is surrounded by muscular fibres, and the large vena cava pierces it. It is of a pearly white colour, and its tendinous fibres cross in different planes and in different directions. In form it re- like a sembles a trefoil leaf; of its three segments the right one is leaf, the largest, whilst the left is the smallest.570 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN, Two The pillars (crura, appendices) are two large muscular pillars, ^ ^ ' rr , . , p , , -, . and tendinous processes, one on each side oi the abdominal with aorta. They are pointed and tendinous below^ where tliey resem- are attached to the upper lumbar vertebrse, but large and fleshy above ; and between them is a tendinous arch over Arrange- the aorta. In each pillar the fleshy fibres succeed to a ment of i. ^ fibres in pointed tcudou, and pass upwards and forwards, diverging from each other. The greater number join the central as they toudou without intermixing. But the internal fibres of to the opposite sides cross one another in the following manner: those of the right side, for instance, ascend by the side of the aorta, and pass to the left of the middle line, decussating between that vessel and the opening of the oesophagus with their fellows ; having changed sides, these fibres are directed upwards to the central tendon around the cesophagean open- ing, which they limit on the left. The fibres of the other crus may be traced in the same way, to form the right half of the oesophagean opening. In the decussation between the aorta and the oesophagus the fasciculus of fibres from the right crus is generally larger than that from the left, and commonly anterior to it. Differ. The piUars differ somewhat on opposite sides. The right the pil- IS the larger of the two, and is fixed by tendinous processes to the front of the bodies of the first three lumbar vertebra?, as well as their intervertebral substance, reaching to the in- tervertebral disc between the third and fourth vertebrae. The left pillar *, which is situate more on the side of the spine, is partly concealed by the aorta, and does not reach so far as the right by the depth of a vertebra, or of an in- tervertebral substance. Two The arches (ligamenta arcuata) are two fibrous bands over the quadratus lumborum and psoas muscles on each side, internal The arch over the psoas (lig. arcuat. internum) is the strongest, and is connected by the one end to the tendinous part of the pillar of the diaphragm, and by the other end to the transverse process of the first or the second lumbar ver- andex. tcbra.

The For the opening for the aorta is rather behind than in the diaphragm, for it is situate between the pillars of the muscle and the spinal column : it transmits the aorta, the thoracic duct, and its con- . tents. sometimes the vena azygos. The opening for the oesophagus yox and the pneumo-gastric nerves is rather above and to the gu^and" left of the aortic aperture: it is situate in the muscular part of the diaphragm, and is bounded by the fibres of the pillars, as above explained. The opening for the vena cava is For the placed in the right division of the central tendon, or between cava, the right and middle pieces, and its margins are attached to the vein by tendinous fibres. It is described as being of a square form (foramen quadratum). There is a fissure in each pillar for the splanchnic nerves, Fissures with one, in the left, for the small azygos vein. Sometimes piiiars. the large azygos vein pierces the right pillar instead of passing with the aorta. Dissection. — After the diaphragm has been learnt, the Take away ribs that support it on each side may be cut through, and greater the pieces of the ribs together with the diaphragm, except the dia, the pillars and the arches with the diaphragmatic vessels at the posterior part, may be taken away to make easier the dissection of the deeper vessels and muscles. The laro;e vessels of the abdomen, viz. the aorta and the Aorta, ^ ' ^ cava.and vena cava, are to be now cleaned by removing from their ^g^"^^" surface the fat with the remains of the sympathetic and the lymphatic glands ; and their branches are also to be followed to the diaphragm, to the kidney and the suprarenal body, to the testicle, and to the lumbar vertebrae and the spinal cord. In like manner the large iliac divisions of the aorta and cava are to be laid bare as far as Poupart's ligament. The ureter and the spermatic vessels are to be cleaned as they cross the iliac artery ; and on this artery branches of a small nerve (genito-crural) are to be sought near the thigh. The psoas, quadratus, and iliacus muscles are to be cleaned ^^^^^^^^^ on the right side ; but on the left side the fascia covering the muscles is to be shown, and the fat to be cleared awayDISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 572 Nerves froHi about the kidney. The psoas muscle is the more in- bar " ternal, and lies on the side of the spine : on its surface, and ^YiQ fat external to it, the branches of the lumbar plexus will be found. The genito-crural nerve lies on the front; and four other nerves issue at the outer border — the ilio- hypogastric and ilio-inguinal near the top, the external cutaneous about the centre, and the large anterior crural at the lower part. Along the inner border of the muscle the gangliated cord of the sympathetic is to be sought with a chain of lumbar lymphatic glands ; and somewhat below the Dissect pelvic part of the muscle, the obturator nerve. External to tus lum- the psoas is the quadratus lumborum muscle, and crossing it near the last rib is the last dorsal nerve, with an artery. In iiiacus the hollow of the hip bone is the iliacus muscle. Both muscle. ^ muscles may be cleaned on the right side, whilst the fascia that covers them may be observed on the opposite side. Extent The ABDOMINAL AORTA extends from the last dorsal ver- aorta. tcbra to the left side of the body of the fourth lumbar ver- tebra, where it divides into the common iliac arteries. Its commencement is bet ween the fleshy pillars of the diaphragm, and its termination is nearly on a level with the highest part Connec. of the crcst of the hip bone. The connections of the vessel tions. , ^ ^ with surrounding parts have been before referred to (p. 519.), and its branches now remain to be examined. Place of The branches of the aorta are numerous, and arise in the or^^m o ^QjjQ^-j^g order: — First, are the diaphragmatic arteries, two es ; in number, which, if they arise separately, leave the sides of the vessel immediately it appears in the abdomen. Close to the tendinous ring of the diaphragm the single trunk of the coeliac axis arises from the front of the aorta; and about a quarter of an inch lower down, also on its front, the trunk of the superior mesenteric artery begins. Half an inch lower the renal arteries, right and left, take origin from the sides of the aorta. On the fore part of the trunk, close above each renal, is the small capsular branch, and below the renal is the spermatic artery. From the front of the aorta, one to two inches above the bifurcation, springs the inferior mesenteric artery ; and from the angle of division the small middle sacral artery runs downwards. Four or five small lumbar arteries on each side come from the pos-573 BRANCHES OF THE AORTA. terior part of the vessel, opposite the bodies of the corre- sponding vertebras. The branches may be classified into two sets, — one that ^^^^ll-^f^_ supplies the viscera of the abdomen (visceral), and another that is furnished to the abdominal walls (parietal). A. The visceral bi'anches are coeliac axis, superior and ^^^^^^^^^^ inferior mesenteric, renal, capsular, and spermatic. All this ^s. set, except the last three, viz. the renal, capsular, and sper- matic, have been examined (p. 513—522.). The renal arteries leave the aorta nearly at a right angle, Rena^ and are directed outwards, one on each side. Near the kidney each divides into four or five branches, which enter the renal substance between the vein and the ureter. Each ^f- ., neath its lies beneath its companion vein, being surrounded by a plexus ^^''^J of nerves, and supplies small twigs to the suprarenal capsule f^^^^^ (inferior capsular), to the ureter, and to the fatty layer about the kidney.

This artery anastomoses with the other branches supplied to the suprarenal body by the renal and phrenic arteries. It is of large size in the foetus.

In the course specified the vessel passes first along the front of the psoas, crossing over the ureter; and as it leaves the abdomen it turns round the epigastric artery, but is separated from that vessel by the vas deferens. On the right side the artery crosses the vena cava. It is accompanied by the spermatic vein, and the spermatic plexus of nerves.DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 574 In the In the female the correspondino; artery (ovarian^ descends female. . , _ , ^ ®, *^ ^ ' into the pelvis to the ovary and the uterus.

Some twigs are given by the left artery to the oesophagus, and by the right to the vena cava. The other parietal branches, viz. lumbar and middle sacral, are not dissected in this stage : the former will be seen after the lumbar plexus (p. 586.), and the latter in the pelvis. Common The COMMON ILIAC ARTERY is directed outwards from the extent bifurcation of the aorta to the base of the sacrum, and divides mina-^" into two large trunks opposite the fibro-cartilage between that bone and the last lumbar vertebra : — one of these sup- plies the lower limb (external iliac), and the other enters Connec- the pclvis (internal iliac).

The place of division oscillates between the middle of the last place of lumbar vertebra, and the upper border of the sacrum, but occa- sionally it will be above or below those points. Generally the left artery divides lower than the right. The EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY is the Commencement of the Externa leading vessel of the lower limb, and is contained in the leads to cavity of the abdomen. Its extent is from the bifurcation of umb. the common iliac to the lower border of Poupart's ligament, ^i^d dl^ where it becomes femoral ; and its direction would be indi- ^^^tion. cated, on the surface of the abdomen, by a line from the left of the umbilicus to the middle of the space between the symphysis pubis and the front of the iliac crest. The vessel lies above the brim of the pelvis, in its course to Poupart's wjth ^ ligament, and is covered closely by the peritoneum and the around, subperitoneal layer in all its extent. Near its origin it is crossed sometimes by the ureter ; and near Poupart's liga- ment the spermatic vessels, and part of the genito-crural nerve, lie on it for a short distance, whilst the circumflex iliac vein crosses it, and the vas deferens bends down along its inner side. To the outer side of the vessel is the psoas, I except at its termination under Poupart's ligament, where that muscle lies beneath it. A chain of lymphatic glands is placed along the front and the inner side of the artery. The ^"fn^^^^ position of the external iliac vein is not the same on both sides. On the left side the vein is altogether internal to the artery; whilst on the right side the vein, though internal in position on the pubes, afterwards lies beneath the arterial trunk.576 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN.

The left is altogether below the artery of its own side, and moreover crosses beneath the right common iliac artery.577 BRANCHES OF THE VENA CAVA INFERIOR. Each receives the ilio-lumbar, and sometimes the lateral veins to sacral branch; and the common iliac of the left side is joined by the middle sacral vein. Peculiarities.—Instead of the common iliac veins uniting at the Place spot mentioned, they may be continued upwards, one on each side the veins of the aorta, as high as the kidney, before the left crosses the i^JJange^^ spine to join the right, and give origin to the vena cava. In these cases the vein on the left side receives one renal vein, and the two common iliacs are connected by a small intervening branch at the spot where they are usually united.

The veins belonging to the digestive appa- digestive ratus, viz. to the intestinal canal, the spleen, and the pan- l^^"^^' \ creas, are united to form the vena portas (p. 525.); and the blood circulating in those veins reaches the cava only after it has circulated through the liver, and then through the indirect channel of the veins of the liver, — the vense cavae hepaticae.

CAVITY OF THE PELVIS. The cavity of the pelvis is but a part of the general abdo- Indsku. ^i^^l space (p. 499.), and is situate below the brim or inlet ation. Qf pelvis. Bound Boundaries. — The space is surrounded by the firm bony aries. ring of the pelvic bones, and therefore admits of little alter- ation in its form or capacity. Behind it is bounded by the sacrum and the coccyx with the sacro-sciatic ligaments, and, laterally and in front by the innominate bones covered by the obturator muscles. Inferiorly, or towards the perinaeum, the cavity is limited by the fascia reflected from the wall to the viscera, and by the levatores ani and coccygei muscles: it is only in this last direction, where the bounding struc- tures are moveable, that alterations can be made in the capacity of the space. Con. Contents. — In the interior are contained the urinary bladder, the lower end of the large intestine, or the rectum, and some of the generative organs according to the sex. All these parts have vessels, nerves, and lymphatics dis- tributed to them, and the serous membrane is reflected over them. Section I. FASCIA OF THE PELVIS AND MUSCLES OF THE OUTLET. Outline On the wall of the pelvis is a thin fascia (pelvic), which fasdaof extends from the brim to the outlet, and covers the obturator v^s. ^^^* muscle. At a certain level a visceral portion is directed in- wards from it to the rectum and the bladder, and this is named recto-vesical fascia from the viscera with which it is connected. steps to Dissection,— To bring into view the parietal part, or the the pel- pelvic fascia, the external iliac vessels, and the psoas if this VIC tas. been removed in the dissection of the lumbar plexus, are to be taken away on the left side of the body. The ob-589 FASCIA OF THE PELVIS. turator vessels and nerve are to be cut away on the same side ; and the peritoneum being detached from the wall of the pelvis, the fascia will be seen on scraping away a large quantity of fat with the handle of the scalpel. But the membrane is now apparent only on its upper half, or as low as the situation of the piece that is prolonged inwards to the viscera; to see its lower half, the student must raise the outlet of the pelvis and look-to the fascia covering the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa. Should the perinaeum be undissected, the fat must be taken from the hollow referred to. If the scalpel be pushed upwards in the fossa, it will enter the pelvis where the visceral joins the parietal piece, and will mark the position of the levator ani muscle between the two. The pelvic fascia is a thin membrane in close contact with Fascia the obturator muscle, and is fixed to the bone around the waii of attachment of the fleshy fibres, so that it might be called the v^s! special fascia (obturator) oPthat muscle. Above it reaches itsat- the brim of the pelvis for a short distance at the lateral ment aspect of the cavity; in front of that spot it does not extend the"ob^ so high as the brim, but following the muscle, forms an musciej arch below the obturator vessels ; whilst farther to the middle line it is fixed along an oblique line near the lower part of the symphysis pubis. Inferiorly the fascia is attached to the margin of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, and to the side of the pubic arch ; but below the pubes it is continued from the one hip bone to the other for a certain distance, so as to join the recto-vesical piece at this spot, and to pajtiy close the front of the cavity of the pelvis. At a certain aperture ^ of pelvis level, viz. that of a line prolonged from the lower part of i"front; the symphysis pubis to the ischial spine, the fascia sends inwards the recto-vesical piece to the viscera of the pelvis : s^^^s ^ recto- the origin of this offset is indicated by a whitish band, vesical ^ *' ^ piece. which marks also the attachment of the levator ani muscle beneath. The outer surface of the fascia is in contact with connec- tions of the obturator muscle. The inner surface, above the origin the lascia. of the recto-vesical piece, corresponds with the cavity of the pelvis, but below that spot, with the ischio-rectal fossa. At the posterior border of the obturator muscle a thin mem- brane is continued backwards to the front of the sacrum,DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 590 over the sacral plexus and the pyriformis muscle, but beneath the vessels, by which it is perforated.

Recto- The recto-vesical fascia may be now seen in a measure ; layer but it will be better displayed after the innominate bone has been taken away for the purpose of giving a side view of the pelvis. How to Dissection, — To obtain a side view of the pelvis it will be remove the in. ncccssary to separate one innominate bone, say the left.

The inno- minate bone is then to be sawn through in front rather ex- ternal to the symphysis; and the lateral articulation with the sacrum is likewise to be sawn through. After the in- nominate bone has been somewhat separated from the rest of the pelvis, the ischial spine with the pelvic fascia attached to it may be cut off with a bone forceps, and then the rest of the bone may be removed by cutting through the pyriformis muscle, the vessels and nerves passing through the sacro- sciatic notch, and any other structure that may retain the bone. Prepara- A Small block is aftcrwards to be placed beneath the tion of , . , the pelvis ; the bladder is to be moderately distended with air ; and some tow is to be introduced into the rectum, also into the vagina of the female, as well as a small piece into the pouch of the peritoneum between the bladder and the rectum. After the viscera are thus made prominent, the recto-vesical fascia and the ischial spine should be raised with hooks, whilst the surfaces of the levator ani and coccygeus muscles are cleaned. Outlet Parts closing the outlet of the pelvis. — In addition to the if closed recto-vesical fascia, the following parts fill the large outlet of the dried pelvis. Beginning behind, the student will first pyri- meet with the pyriformis, passing through the great sacro-591 COCCYGEUS MUSCLE AND LEVATOR ANI. sciatic notch, with the gluteal artery and nerve above it. ^y^^ Next he will come to the coccygeus muscle, with the sacro- us, and sciatic ligament stretched between the ischial spine and the «/^iatic coccyx, one border of the muscle reaching towards the ments, pyriformis, and the other to the levator ani; and between ^esj^eis the posterior border and the pyriformis will be the sacral serves; plexus of nerves, and the sciatic and pudic vessels. The greater part of the rest of the space will be seen to be closed bv the levator ani, which extends forwards from the coccy- leva- geus to the posterior part of the symphysis pubis ; it meets and by its fellow inferiorly, but, in front, the muscles of opposite fatda sides are separated by the urethra and the prostate gland, ['he"^ and the interval between them is closed by the fascia lining the pelvis. The COCCYGEUS MUSCLE is flat and triangular, and assists Coccy- to close the outlet of the pelvis. It arises by a narrow origin process from the upper part of the ischial spine, and some fibres are attached to the small sacro-sciatic ligament. Widening as it passes inwards, the muscle is inserted into and in. the side and anterior surface of the coccyx, and the side of the lower piece of the sacrum. The inner surface looks to connec- the pelvis, and is in contact with the rectum on the left surfaces side ; the opposite surface rests on the small sacro-sciatic ligament. The hinder border is contiguous to the pvriformis and 11 1 -. . . -,1 . borders. muscle, only vessels and nerves intervening, and the anterior or lower border is parallel with the levator ani muscle and is connected with it. The LEVATOR ANI is a thin flat muscle, which is attached Levator am ; above to the side of the pelvis, and descends below into the situa. outlet of that cavity, where it joins its fellow, and supports the viscera. It arises anteriorly by fleshy fibres from an Origin oblique line on the posterior aspect of the pubes, and pos- from teriorly, from the inner surface of the ischial spine ; and and ' between those two points of bone the muscle takes origin tvom from the under part of the recto-vesical fascia, along the trane. line of the white band before alluded to (p. 589.). All the fibres are directed downwards to the middle line of the body, to be inserted after the following manner : — The J.^ser- anterior, the longest, descend by the side of the prostate and loin, anterior to the rectum, with the muscle of the J'"^ of ^ ' ' ^ the pen- opposite side in the central point of the perinsetim ; the n«uni.DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 592 middle fibres blend with the side of the rectum ; whilst the posterior meet the opposite muscle behind the gut, and are attached in part to the side of the coccyx, as before described in the dissection of the perinseum (p. 447.). The anterior fibres of the levator are in contact with the fascia that closes the pelvic cavity below the pubes, and the posterior are parallel to the coccygeus muscle. The upper surface is con- tiguous to the recto-vesical fascia, and the viscera of the pelvis ; and the under surface looks to the perinaeum (ischio- rectal fossa). The two muscles, by their union, form a fleshy layer or diaphragm across the outlet of the pelvis, similar to that which separates the abdomen from the chest: this partition is convex below and concave above, and gives passage to the rectum. In front there is an interval between the anterior fibres, which allows the urethra, together with the vagina in the female, to pass from the pelvis. Anterior Tlic anterior part of the muscle that descends by the side fibres ... named of the prostatc, and unites with its fellow below the mem- pros- branous part of the urethra, thus supporting that canal as in a sling, has been named levator seu compressor prostatce.

The URINARY BLADDER (vcsica Urinaria) is situate in the Bladder \ ^ IS in pelvis, and is the receptacle for the fluid secreted by the pei^is kidneys. When the bladder is contracted it is of a trian- empty, gular form, and lies within the pelvis against the anterior wall of the cavity.

If a line through its centre were Axis, prolonged, it would touch the abdominal wall somewhere (according to the distension) between the umbilicus and the pubes in the one direction, and the end of the coccyx in the other direction. The organ is maintained in its position by the recto-vesical fascia and the peritoneum, which form its ligaments (p. 593. 595.). For the purpose of studvinff its connections the bladder is ■■^ -"^ o sions. divided into the following parts: —a summit and base, and a body and neck. The summit or apex of the bladder is rounded, and from ^p^x ^ ' has cords its anterior part three ligamentous cords are prolonged to the umbilicus : the central one of these is the remnant of the urachus, and the two lateral are formed by the obli- terated hypogastric arteries. If the bladder is full, the apex is above, but otherwise below the pubes. All the surface behind the obliterated vessels is covered by peri- toneum. The base (fundus) is large, and rests on the middle piece Base of the rectum. In the state of emptiness of the bladder the base is scarcely prominent; but in distension of the viscus, alters in this part extends lower, and becomes widened.

Extending along the upper part of each lateral region is the obliterated hypogastric vessel, and crossing it lower down is the vas deferens ; near the under part is the entrance of the ureter into the bladder. All the side of the bladder behind the obliterated vessel is covered by peritoneum, but the rest is uncovered. Neck. The neck (cervix) is the narrow anterior part of the bladder that joins the urethra. It is surrounded by the prostate gland. Position The position of the bladder in the pelvis is not the same varies^^^ in adult as in early life. For in the child this viscus pro- with age • "jects above the brim of the pelvis into the hypogastric region of the abdomen, and the cervix is the lowest part. But in the adult the bladder is contained within the space enclosed by the larger pelvic bones, and the base or fundus projects inferiorly.

Its shape is that of a cone with the base turned backwards, and its axis; size equals nearly a large horse chesnut. In the present position of the pelvis, a line through the middle of the gland would be directed obliquely downwards and backwards, though, in the erect state of the body, it would be almost horizontal. upper The upper surface is about three quarters of an inch be- surface; , , . . i • i i low the symphysis pubis, and is connected to it by the an- terior ligaments of the bladder.

The prostate is enveloped by a sheath obtained from the it is recto-vesical fascia (p. 592.), and a plexus of veins (prostatic) ^^^'^^^ surrounds it: through the middle of the gland the urethra takes its course to the penis. The size of the prostate alters ijf^f^g^gg^ much with increasing age, and in old people it may acquire a considerable magnitude. The VESicuLJE SEMINALES are two small sacculated bodies, seminai vesicles; each about two inches long, between the under part of the bladder and the rectum. Each is pyramidal in form, and their has the larger end turned backwards towards the ureter, tions. ' whilst the smaller is surrounded by the prostate. Along the inner side is the vas deferens. At the prostate gland the vesiculae are close together; but farther backwards they diverge from one another, and enclose with the pouch of the peritoneum a triangular space at the under aspect of the bladder. The vesiculas are contained in a membranous sheath, which is derived from the recto-vesical fascia. The VAS DEFERENS or the excretory duct of the testis^ in vas de- its course to the urethra, enters the abdomen by the in- ^^^^^^' ternal abdominal ring, and is then directed inwards along the side and under part of the bladder to the base of the prostate, where it forms the common ejaculatory duct by joining with the duct from the vesicula seminalis. The position of this tube to the external iliac artery has been noticed ; on the bladder it may be seen to cross the obli- terated hypogastric artery, and to pass internal to the ureter and the vesicula of the same side. By the side of the vesicula the duct is much enlarged, and is sacculated. The URETHRA is the excretory passage for the urine and '^^^^^^^ semen, and reaches from the bladder to the end of the penis. Its length varies from seven and a half to eight inches and length ; a half, and it presents one or two curves according to the state of the penis. At first the canal is directed forwards and jt is upwards, through the triangular ligament of the perinseum, accord- to the body of the penis, forming a large curve with the con- iSf con- cavity to the pubes.

It is somewhat curved up- wards, and the bulb of the next portion of the urethral tube is directed backwards below it, so that the under part appears tSris^^' measure less than the upper. Surrounding it are the muscular fibres of the constrictor urethrae ; close below it are Cowper's glands, and beneath or behind it is the rectum. This division of the urethra is the weakest; but it is sup- ported by the triangular ligament. Spongy. The spongi/ part is so named from its being surrounded by a cellular and vascular structure. It is applied to the body of the penis assisting to form this, and terminates an- teriorly in the orifice named meatus urinarius in the end of the glans. It is the longest part of the urethra, and measures about five inches. At its commencement this division of the excretory canal is surrounded by the ejaculator uringe muscle. D^ssec Dissection,— All the tegumentary covering of the penis may be removed, to see the component parts of that body: and after its removal the spongy part of the urethra will be better seen.

Its base is gians directed backwards, and is marked by a slightly prominent ^^"^^ border — the corona glandis; it is also sloped obliquely along the under aspect, from the apex to the base. In the apex is a vertical slit, in which the urethral canal terminates ; and below that aperture is an excavation which contains the frsenum preputii. Section III. CONNECTIONS OF THE VISCERA IN THE FEMALE. In the pelvis of the female are contained the lower end of con- the intestinal tube, and the bladder and the urethra, as in the the male; but there are in addition the generative organs, peivis, viz. the uterus with its accessories, and the vagina.602 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. and their PosltioTi, — The rectum is posterior to the rest as in the tion." male pelvis, and forms a like curve. In the concavity of the bent intestine lie the uterus with its appendages, and the tube of the vagina. And in front of these are the bladder and the urethral canal. In this sex there are three tubes connected with the viscera, and all are directed forwards, one above another, to the surface, viz. the tube of the ure- thra, that of the vagina, and that of the rectum. Use Directions.— The description in Section I. (p. 588.) of descrip- ^ ^ ^ ^ . maie°^ the male pelvis must be used for instructions respecting the pelvis, removal of the innominate bone, and for the anatomy of the fasciae, and the muscles of the outlet of the pelvis. After the student has learnt, as directed above, the fasciae and the muscles, which are nearly alike in both sexes, he may make the following special dissection of the viscera of the female pelvis. Then Dissectiofi. — On taking away the recto-vesical fascia and clean' the much fat, the several viscera will come into view. To of the maintain the position of the uterus, this may be held up pelvis, with a piece of string passed through the upper part. The reflections of the peritoneum on the viscera are to be pre- served, and a piece of cotton wool is to be placed between the rectum and the uterus. The obliterated part of the in- ternal iliac artery is to be followed forwards to the bladder, but all the other branches may be cut away on this the left side ; the ureter will be found passing to the bladder close to that artery. Afterwards the urethra, the vagina, and the rectum are to be cleaned and partly separated from one another at the anterior part of the pelvis, but the arteries on the rectum are to be preserved. Reflec^ The peritoneum gives a partial covering to the viscera, as the"peri- in the male pelvis. Investing the upper part of the rectum, and forming behind it the meso-rectum, the membrane is continued for a short distance on the front of the intestine to the posterior part of the vagina, and the back of the uterus. It covers the posterior, and the greater part of the anterior surface of the uterus, and can be traced to the bladder without again touching the vagina. On each side of the uterus it forms a wide fold (broad ligament), which attaches that viscus to the wall of the abdomen and pelvis. As the peritoneum is followed upwards to the wall of the toneum.,603 LIGAMENTS OF THE UTERUS AND THE BLADDER, abdomen, it will be found to cover the posterior surface of the bladder, and the part on each side behind the position of the obliterated hypogastric artery. In the female the pouch between the rectum and the bladder can scarcely be said to exist, because the vagina intervenes between the two, and arrests, so to express it, the passing forwards of the perito- neum. In the pelvis the serous membrane forms the follow- Folds or liga- ing ligaments for the uterus and bladder: — ments The broad ligament of the uterus passes from the side of broad the uterus to the wall of the abdomen, and supports that mint organ in the cavity of the pelvis. By its position across thcu terus, pelvis, it divides the cavity into an anterior and a posterior part: in the former are placed the bladder, urethra, and vagina ; in the latter the upper part of the rectum, and the which is small intestine when it reaches the pelvis. Each ligament ^"^^^^^ shows traces of a subdivision into three pieces, corresponding three with the bodies contained between its two layers: thus there is a posterior piece that belongs to the ovary and its ligament; an anterior, near the upper part, which is appropriated to the round ligament; and a middle piece, the highest of all, that surrounds the Fallopian tube. It is at the free extrem- ity of the Fallopian tube that the peritoneum is continuous with a mucous membrane. Between the neck of the uterus and the back of the and an- bladder is a small fold on each side, which is sometimes de- liga- scribed as the anterior ligament of the uterus. The false ligaments of the bladder are the same as in the Five li- ■1 -I • 1 • • 11 gaments male, and are five m number, viz. two posterior, two lateral, of the and a superior: they are all blended in one large piece of peritoneum that reaches from the bladder to the side and the front of the pelvis. In the female the posterior ligament, containing the ureter and the vessels of the bladder, is less marked than in the male, because the uterus intervenes and pushes aside the vessels. The RECTUM is not so curved in the female as in the male, connec- and is generally larger. Descending along the middle of the the rec- sacrum and coccyx to the anus, the intestine is divided into three parts : — The first part extends to the third piece of the sacrum, of upper, and is enveloped by the peritoneum, except posteriorly : its connections are similar to those of the rectum in the male.604 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 1 middle. The middle part reaches to the tip of the coccyx, and has the vagina above and in contact with it.

Uterus; The UTERUS is somcwhat of a conical shape, and is flat- and situ- tened from before backwards. It is situate in the pelvis ation. ^ between the bladder and the rectum, and is retained in place by the broad ligaments.

The lower end, or the neck (cervix uteri) is received into the vagina. On the To cach sidc are attached the broad ligament with the Fallopian tube, the round ligament, and the ovary. Faiio. a. The Fallopian tube is contained in the free border of tube, the ligament; one end is connected to the upper angle of the uterus, whilst the other is loose in the cavity of the pelvis. At its attachment to the uterus the tube is of small size, but at the opposite extremity it is dilated, like the end of a trumpet, and fringed, forming the corpus fimbriatum. round b. The Tound or suspensory ligament is a fibrous cord, nfent, which is directed outwards through the internal abdominal ring and the inguinal canal to the groin. This cord lies over the obliterated hypogastric, and the external iliac artery; and is surrounded by the peritoneum, which accompanies it a short way into the canal.605 THE VAGINA AND BLADDER. c. The ovary is placed nearly horizontally, and bulges at and the the posterior aspect of the broad ligament; it is connected to and"^^ the uterus at the inner end by a special fibrous band, ligament "^^^^^ of the ovary. Its form is oval, and its margins are turned forwards and backwards. Its size is very variable. The Vagina is the tube by which the uterus communicates vagina: extent with the exterior of the body. It is somewhat cylindrical in and shape, though flattened on the front and back; audits length • • length * is from four to five inches. The vagina is slightly curved as it follows the bend of the rectum, and its axis therefore cor- axis ; responds at first with the centre of the outlet, but higher up with that of the cavity of the pelvis. In front the vagina is in contact with the base of the bladder, and the urethra ; and beneath or below it is the rectum. To the side is attached the recto-vesical fascia, which sends a sheath along the lower connec- half of the tube. The upper end receives the neck of the uterus by an aperture in the anterior or upper wall; and the lower end is the narrowest part of the canal, and is sur- rounded by the sphincter vaginas muscle. In children, and Lower in the virgin, the external aperture is closed by the hymen, partly The vagina is surrounded by a large plexus of veins.

On the side of the viscus there is not any vas deferens; and the prostate is absent from the neck. The ureter has a longer course in the pelvis of the female "^^e- than in that of the male, before it reaches the bladder, ^^r. After crossing the internal iliac vessels, it passes by the neck of the uterus ere it arrives at its destination. The urethra is a small narrow tube about one inch and a Urethra; length half long, which curves slightly below the symphysis pubis, the concavity being upwards. Its situation is above theDISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. < 606 vagina, and its external opening is placed within tlie vulva.

Directions. — The internal iliac vessels are to be dissected on the right side. But the air should be previously let out of the bladder, and this viscus and the rectum, together with the uterus and the vagina in the female, should be drawn from their situation in the centre of the pelvis. To dis- Dissection. — The peritoneum and the loose tissue and fat vSsefs^ are to be removed from the viscera and the trunks of the pelvis, vessels, as well as from the branches that leave the pelvis or supply the viscera ; and the obliterated cord of the artery is to be traced on the bladder to the umbilicus. With the Nerves, vcsscls are offsets of the hypogastric plexus of nerves, but, in the present state of the body, these will probably not be seen; and in dissecting the vessels to the bladder and the rectum, branches of the spinal sacral nerves will come into Veins, vicw. The veins in a general dissection may be removed to make clean the arteries. When the vessels are quite pre- pared the bladder may be again distended, and the viscera replaced. Destina- The INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY is onc of the trunks resulting internal from the divisiou of the common iliac vessel, and furnishes artery; branches to the viscera and the wall of the pelvis, to the generative organs, and to the thigh. In the adult the vessel is a short trunk, of large capacity, size and ^ . - lengthj which mcasurcs about an inch and a half in length. Directed connec- tions with parts around.607 INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. downwards, as far as the sacro-sciatic notch, the artery ter- J^^^J^^;. minates in two large branches, from which the several offsets are furnished. From the extremity a partly oblite- rated vessel (hypogastric) extends forwards to the bladder. In entering the pelvis the artery lies in front of the lumbo-1^'^^^. sacral nerve and the pyriformis muscle, and is contained in connec. the fold of peritoneum forming the posterior ligament of the bladder. It is accompanied by the internal iliac vein, which is posterior to it, and somewhat on the outer part on the right side. The branches of the artery are numerous, and arise ^l^^^^' usually in the following manner: — from the posterior divi- sion of the trunk arise the ilio-lumbar, lateral sacral, and gluteal branches; and from the anterior division come the vesical (upper and lower) obturator, sciatic, and pudic ; and, in the female, the uterine and vaginal branches. Artery in the foetus, — In the foetus the internal iliac be- f^on^of comes the hypogastric artery^ and leaves the abdomen by {eryTn the umbilicus. At that time it is larger than the external fj]g iliac artery; and, entering but slightly into the cavity of the pelvis, it is directed forwards to the back of the bladder, and then upwards along the side of that viscus to the apex. Be- yond the bladder the vessel ascends along the posterior aspect of the abdominal wall with the urachus, converging to its fellow; at the umbilicus the vessels of opposite sides come into contact with the umbilical vein, and, passing from the abdomen through the aperture at that spot, enter into the placental cord, and receive the name umhilicaL In the foetus, as in the adult, similar branches are furnished by the artery, though their relative size at the two periods is very different. Change to adult state, —When uterine life has ceased the t"ansfor. hypogastric artery diminishes in consequence of the arrest ^to'that of the current of blood through it, and finally becomes obli- ^^^^l terated more or less completely as far back as an inch and a half of its commencement, only a cord remaining in the posi- tion of the former vessel. Commonly, the cord remains per- vious by means of a very small canal as far as the upper part of the bladder, and gives origin to the vesical arteries. Peculiarities.—The length of the internal iliac artery varies from Trunk 1 . , , . vanes in nail an inch to three inches, its extreme measurements; but in two length.DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 608 1 thirds of a certain number of bodies (Quain) it ranged from an inch to an inch and a half.

The ilio-lumbar branch passes outwards beneath the haTan^ psoas musclc and the obturator nerve, but in front of the lumbo-sacral nerve, and divides into an ascending and a transverse branch in the iliac fossa, ascend- a. The asccndiuff or lumbar offset, which is beneath the ing and psoas, supplies that muscle and the quadratus lumborum, and anastomoses with the last lumbar artery: it sends a small spinal branch through the foramen between the sacrum and the last lumbar vertebra, a trans- b. The trausvcrso or iliac part divides into branches that verse . , .,. branch, ramify in the iliacus muscle, some runmng over and some beneath it. At the iliac crest these branches anastomose with the lumbar and circumflex iliac arteries ; and some twigs from the deep branches communicate with the obtu- rator artery, and enter the innominate bone. Lateral 2. The lateral sacral branches are two in number, su- arteries perior and inferior, but the upper is the largest; they corre- spond in situation with the lumbar arteries, and form a chain of anastomoses by the side of the apertures in the front of the sacrum. These branches supply the pyriformis and coccygeus muscles, and anastomose with the foregoing, as supply well as with the middle sacral branch. A small spinal b'randi. branch enters the spinal canal through each aperture in the sacrum. Gluteal; 3. The gluteal artery is a short thick trunk, which appears to be the continuation of the posterior division of the internal iliac. Its destination is to the gluteal muscles on the dorsum of the innominate bone, and it is transmitted from the pelvis above the border of the pyriformis muscle, with its accom- panying vein and the superior gluteal nerve. Small In the pelvis this artery gives small branches to the con- tiguous muscles, viz. the iliacus, pyriformis, and obturator, and a nutritious artery to the hip bone. t artery. offsets.609 BRANCHES OF THE INTERNAL ILIAC. The branches from the anterior division of the internal Branch- es of the iliac artery are the following: — tumk""^ 1. The vesical arteries are named superior and inferior, vesical and are distributed to the upper and lower parts of the ' bladder. a. The upper vesical are three or four in number, and three or arise at intervals from the partly obliterated hypogastric upper, trunk; the lowest is sometimes called middle vesical branch. Offsets are distributed from these branches to all the body and the upper part of the bladder. b. The lower vesical artery arises from the front of the ^ , *' lower, internal iliac in common with a branch to the rectum, or with one to the vagina in the female. It, is distributed to the base of the bladder, the vesiculas seminales, and the pros- tate. A small offset from this artery, or from the upper vesical, is furnished to the vas deferens, and ascends on it as far as the inguinal canal. 2. The branch to the rectum (middle hasmorrhoidal) is with an ^ ^ offset to commonly supplied by the inferior vesical, as before said, or JJj^^^'^- by the pudic. It ramifies on the anterior and lower part of the rectum, and on the vagina in the female, and anastomoses with the superior and inferior hgemorrhoidal arteries. 3. The obturator artery is distributed outside the pelvis, obtura- and merely crosses this cavity to reach the aperture of exit, tery" " The branch springs usually from the anterior division of the courses internal iliac artery, and is directed forwards below the brim peivff. of the pelvis to the aperture in the upper part of the thyroid foramen. Passing from the pelvis by that opening, the 1 artery ends in two branches, which join on the membrane closing the thyroid foramen, and lie beneath the muscle in that spot. In the pelvis the artery has its companion nerve offsets above, and vein below it, and it distributes the following pelvis j small branches: — a. Iliac branch, — Amongst other small offsets, the obtu- rator furnishes a twig to the iliac fossa to supply the bone and the iliacus muscle; this anastomoses with the ilio-lum- j bar artery. b. The pubic branch, arising as the artery is about to pubic^ leave the pelvis, ascends on the posterior aspect of the pubes, and communicates with the corresponding branch of the opposite side, as well as with an offset sent downwards from RRDISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 610 the epigastric artery. There may be more than one branch to the pubes. Its ori- Peculiarities. — The obturator artery may arise at the front of epiga^s^"^ the pelvis, from the epigastric instead of the internal iliac, and turn OTiiiac, down almost vertically to the thyroid aperture. Or, it may arise or from by two roots, one from the epigastric, another from the internal iliac, the roots varying in size in different instances: thus they may be nearly equal in size; that from the internal iliac may be the larger of the two; or that from the epigastric may be the largest. The position of the obturator to the internal crural ring, in the in- stances of its origin from the epigastric, has been before alluded to (p. 498.). From In some bodies, the obturator may be found to take origin from fifac^"^^ the external iliac artery. Fre- An account of the frequency with which these different pecu- of the^ liarities occur, will be found in Mr, Quain's work on the " Ana- oriJnT^ tomy of the Arteries." Suffice it to say here, that the origin from the internal iliac is the most frequent; that from the epigastric next; and the origin from the two sources, or from the external iliac artery, the least frequent. Sciatic 4. The sciatic artery is the next largest branch to the artery , -g (distributed to the buttock, and may be con- sidered the oifset by which the internal iliac artery ter- in the minates. The artery is continued over the pyriformis pelvis, jj^^g^ig ^YiQ sacral plexus to the lower part of the sacro- sciatic notch, where it leaves the pelvis between the pyri- and out- formis and the coccysreus. External to the pelvis it divides side it. into branches beneath the gluteus maximus muscle. In the pelvis it supplies the pyriformis and coccygeus muscles. Pudic 5. The pudic artery supplies the perinasum and the genital fn^he organs, and has nearly the same connections in the pelvis as \ pelvis, the sciatic, from which it often springs. If the artery arises j by a separate trunk from the internal iliac, it accompanies ! the sciatic, though external to it, and leaves the pelvis be- tween the pyriformis and coccygeus. At the back of the pelvis it winds over the ischial spine of the hip bone, and i enters the perinseum. (See p. 458.) Some In the pelvic part of its course the artery gives some offsets, unimportant branches, and frequently the middle haemor- rhoidal branch arises from it. When Peculiarities,—The pudic artery is sometimes smaller than usual, thTn and fails to supply some of its ordinary perinaeal branches, espe- anTcces- ^^^^^7 terminal for the penis. In those cases the deficientBRANCHES OF THE INTERNAL ILIAC. 611 branches are derived from an artery, accessory pudic (Quain), sory which takes origin mostly from the trunk of the pudic inside the cimef pelvis, and courses forwards on the side of the bladder, and the huSnai upper part of the prostate gland, to leave the pelvis below the pubic arch. It furnishes branches to supply the place of those that are wanting. The branches of the internal iliac artery that are peculiar Branch- to the female are two, the uterine and vaginal. female!"^ 6. The uterine artery passes inwards between the layers uterine of the broad ligament, to the neck of the uterus. At that ^'^^'^ part the vessel changes its direction, and ascends along the side of the uterus to the fundus, where it anastomoses with the ovarian artery (spermatic) of the aorta. Numerous branches enter the substance of the uterus, ramifyinsr in it supplies _ ' ./ o J uterus and anastomose with those of the opposite side. This artery and its branches are remarkable for their tortuous condition. a. At the neck of the uterus some small twigs are supplied offsets to the vagina and the bladder; and the special vaginal artery g'inaT may arise from it at that spot. b. Branches in the broad ligament. — One branch ac- the companies the round ligament into the inguinal canal and anastomoses with a branch of the epigastric. Another ex- tends on the Fallopian tube, and divides into long branches that reach the end. And a third offset, according to J. Weber, is distributed to the ovary, 7. The vaginal artery seldom arises separately from the Vaginai internal iliac: combined with the preceding, or with the branch to the rectum, this artery extends to the vagina, and ramifies in its wall as low as the outer orifice. Other arteries in the pelvis, — The remaining arteries in Branch- the pelvis, which are not derived from the internal iliac, are fom'^^ the ovarian, superior haemorrhoidal, and middle sacral. The ovarian artery has been described in part with the Ovarian branches of the aorta, and has been traced to the pelvis (p. 573.). After passing the brim of the pelvis it becomes tor- tuous, and enters the broad ligament to be distributed to the ovary: in the ligament there is a free anastomosis between the ovarian and uterine arteries. The superior hcBmorrhoidal artery is the continuation of superior the trunk of the inferior mesenteric behind the rectum, nfoTdS" and divides into two branches near the middle of the sacrum. RR 2DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 612 From the point of the division of the trunk these branches are continued along the rectum, one on each side, and finally end in about six branches, which enter the gut three inches from the end, and terminate in anastomotic loops opposite the inner sphincter: they anastomose with the other vessels, viz. the middle and inferior haemorrhoidal arteries. Middle The Middle sacral artery, a small branch from the bifur- sacral, ^' 'w^hich cation of the aorta, descends along the middle line of the body, over the last lumbar vertebra, the sacrum, and the coccyx, and terminates at the lower part of the spinal column, by anastomosing with the lateral sacral arteries, laferai couTsc the artery gives small branches laterally, offsets, opposite each piece of the sacrum, to anastomose with the lateral sacral arteries, and supply the nerves, and the bones with their periosteum. Sometimes a small branch is fur- nished by it to the lower end of the rectum, which takes the place of the middle hasmorrhoidal artery. Internal The INTERNAL ILIAC VEIN reccivcs the blood from the wall Vein: of the pclvis, and the pelvic viscera, by branches corre- uniting spending for the most part with those of the arteries. The position ^^^^ is a short and thick trunk, which is situate at first on the inner side of the internal iliac artery ; but as it ascends to join with the external iliac it passes behind, and on the right side reaches even the outer aspect of its companion artery. Its Some of the branches that form the trunk of the internal branches that are iliac vciu, viz. the gluteal, obturator, and sciatic, have the pecuhar . . are same anatomy as the arteries; but the following visceral branches, the pudic and dorsal of the penis, the vesical and haemorrhoidal, the uterine and vaginal, have some peculi- arities. pudic The pudic vein receives roots corresponding with the branches of the artery in the perinseum, but not those cor- responding with the offsets of the artery on the dorsum of the penis. Its haemorrhoidal branch commences in a large plexus around the lower end of the rectum (plexus hasmor- rhoidalis) with which the superior haemorrhoidal vein com- municates. dorsal The doTsal vein of the penis receives vessels from the penis, body of the penis, viz. the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum, pierces the triangular ligament of the urethra,613 SPINAL SACRAL NERVES. and divides into two, a right and a left branch, which enter a plexus around the membranous part of the urethra and the prostate. The vesical veins commence in a plexus about the lower vesical, part of the bladder, and anastomose with the prostatic and hasmorrhoidal veins. The uterine veins are numerous, and form a plexus in and ^j^^'^^'^^ by the side of the uterus. This plexus inosculates above with the ovarian plexus, and below with one on the vagina. The vaginal veins surround the vagina with a large vas- vaginal , , veins. cular plexus. Parietal veins of the pelvis. — The other veins of the wall Parietal veins. of the pelvis, viz. the ilio-lumbar, lateral sacral, and middle sacral, open into the common iliac vein. Dissection.— To dissect the nerves of the pelvis it will be pissec- necessary to detach the urethra from the arch of the pubes, the nerves and to cut through on the right side the recto-vesical fascia of the and the levator ani, together with the visceral arteries, in order that the viscera may be drawn from the side of the pelvis. If the bladder is distended let the air escape from it. By means of this dissection the sacral nerves will be sacrai seen as they issue from the sacral foramina; and the dis- cygeai, sector should follow the first four into the sacral plexus, as well as some branches from the fourth to the viscera. A branch of nerve, superior gluteal, is to be shown arising from the lumbo-sacral cord, as this passes to the sacral plexus. The last sacral and the coccygeal nerve are of small size, and will be found coming through the coccygeus muscle close to the coccyx ; these are to be dissected with care, and the student will best find them by tracing the connecting filaments which pass from one to another, beginning above with the offset from the fourth nerve. Opposite the lower part of the rectum, bladder, and vagina andsym- is a large plexus of the sympathetic, the pelvic plexus, which p^**'^''^' sends offsets to the viscera along the arteries. This plexus is generally destroyed in this stage of the dissection ; but if it should remain the student may trace the offsets from it, and the communicating branches with the spinal nerves. Spinal sacral nerves.— The anterior primary branches sacrai of the sacral nerves are five in number, and decrease sud- are five; denly in size from above downwards ; for whilst the first two E E 3614 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. are large trunks, the last two are small and slender.

It is situate on the pyriformis muscle, and beneath the sciatic and pudic and branches of the internal iliac artery. From the spot where the nerves join, the plexus becomes gradually smaller to- wards the lower end; and, leaving the pelvis below the pyri- formis, terminates in branches for the lower limb.SYMPATHETIC IN THE PELVIS. 615 Most of the branches of the plexus arise outside the pelvis, its and are distributed to the back of the lower limb.

The nerves of the pyriformis are commonly two in number, py^^f^^ and arise from separate parts of the plexus : they enter the muscle at its visceral aspect. The pudic nerve, like the artery of the same name, sup- ^^^^^ plies the rectum, the peringeum, and the genital organs. The nerve arises at the lower part of the plexus as this is now about to pass from the pelvis, and then accompanies its at its origin. artery through the small sacro-sciatic notch to the perineum.

See Dissection of the Buttock. The superior gluteal nerve is a branch of the lumbo-sacral superior cord, and arises from it opposite the upper part of the large nerve sacro-sciatic notch. It passes outwards above the pyriformis ends in muscle to the back of the pelvis, where it ends chiefly in musdeV branches for the two smaller gluteal muscles.

Clean When the viscera are removed, the rectum is to be sepa- biadder rated from the other organs ; but the bladder, the penis, pi^o- and the urethra are to remain united. After the bladder state. has been distended with air, the peritoneum and the con- nective tissue are to be dissected from the muscular fibres. The prostate gland and the vesiculse seminales are to be then cleaned ; and the duct of the latter, with the vas deferens, is to be followed into the gland.

Pro- Prostate Gland.— This is a firm muscular and glan- giand :^ dular body which secretes a special fluid, and surrounds the situa- neck of the bladder and the beginning of the urethra. Its connections with the surrounding parts have been enume- rated (p. 598.). Form, This body is conical in form, with the base or larger end directed backwards, and is usually likened to a chesnut, dimen. which it much resembles. Its dimensions in different direc- sions, tions are the following :— Transversely at the base it mea- sures about an inch and a half; from apex to base rather more than an inch; and in depth about three quarters of an inch or an inch: so that an incision directed obliquely downwards and outwards from the apex to the base, at its lateral part, will be the longest that can be practised in the and half of this bodv. Its weight is about an ounce, but in this weight. ^ ^ ° ' respect it varies greatly, sur- The upper surface of the prostate is rounded, but a slight groove lies along the middle; and the under surface, which is larger and flatter, is marked by a median hollow that and base, indicates the division into lateral lobes. The posterior part, or the base, is thick, and in its centre is an excavation which receives the common ejaculatory ducts. Three Three lobes are described in the prostate, viz. a middle and two lateral, though there is no fissure in the firm mass. The lateral parts or lobes are similar on each side, and619 THE PROSTATE GLAND. are separated only by the hollow on the under surface ; they two form the chief part of the prostate, and are prolonged back, on each side, beyond the notch in the base. The middle and a . .11 1 • 1 .1 central. lobe Will be- brought into view by detaching the vesiculas seminales and the ejaculatory ducts from the bladder : it is a small piece of the gland between the neck of the bladder and the ejaculatory ducts, which extends transversely be- tween the lateral lobes. Oftentimes this middle lobe is enlarged in old people, and projects upwards into the bladder, so as to interfere with the flow of the urine from that viscus, or the passage of a catheter into it. The urethra and the two common ejaculatory ducts are Giand contained in the substance of the prostate: the former is three transmitted through the gland from base to apex ; and the latter perforate it obliquely to terminate in the urethral canal. Structure, — On a section the gland appears reddish in struc- colour, is very firm to the feel, and is scarcely lacerable. It is made up of a mass of fibrous and involuntary muscular tissue with interspersed glandular structure ; and the whole is enveloped by a fibrous coat. Fibrous covering.— This forms a thin investment for the Fibrous gland, and sends ofisets into the interior. It is quite dis- distinct tinct from the dense capsule derived from the pelvic fascia, pelvic and is separated from that by the plexus of veins. Muscular tissue. — The firm fibrous looking ^art of the muscu- gland consists of involuntary muscular fibres, intermixed fibrous with elastic and connective tissues. The muscular fibres are ^^^^' arranged circularly around the tube of the urethra : they arrang- are continuous behind with the annular fibres of the bladder, and in front with a layer of circular fibres around the mem- branous part of the urethra. At the lower and outer parts of the gland the texture is looser and more spongy, especially where the glands are situate and where the larger vessels enter.* This arrangement will be better seen afterwards when the urethra has been opened. Glandular structure.— This element, forming but about oiands one third of the whole gland, is in greatest abundance towards the circumference and in the part called middle lobe.

On the exterior of the vesicles and are ves- seis. the ducts the bloodvessels ramify; and lining the interior of the tubes is an epithelium of the columnar kind, which becomes laminar in the vesicles. The ducts of the gland are not collected into one excretory tube, but vary in number Ducts from twelve to twenty, and open into the prostatic part of into the urethra (p. 625.) urethra. ^ Arteries. Bloodvessels. — The arteries are unimportant, and are furnished Veins by the vesical and hasmorrhoidal (p. 609.). The veins form a plexus, plexus around the gland, which communicates in front with the dorsal vein of the penis, and behind with a plexus of veins at the base of the bladder. In old men this vascular communication gives rise to considerable haemorrhage in the operation of lithotomy. Seminal Yesicul^ Seminales. — Thcsc vesiclcs are two membra- Defini-* ^^us sacs, that are supposed to serve as reservoirs for the tion. secreted semen. They are placed on the under part of the tion. bladder behind the prostate, and diverge from one another so as to limit laterally a triangular surface at this aspect of the viscus: their form and connections have been already saccu- described (p. 599.). Though sacculated behind, the vesicula latea. i^ecomes Straight and somewhat narrowed in front; and at the base of the prostate it is blended with the vas deferens to form the common ejaculatory duct. Formed The vcsicula seminalis consists, like the epididymis, of a coifed tube bent into a zigzag form, so as to produce lateral sacs or pouches, which are bound together by fibrous tissue; this cellular structure will be shown by means of a cut into it.

End of End of vas deferens. — Opposite the vesicula the vas deferens, deferens is increased in capacity, and is rather sacculated like the contiguous vesicle; but before it joins with the tube of that body to form the common ejaculatory duct, it diminishes in size, and becomes straight. haTa^^ Structure, — The seminal vesicle has the same number ofTHE URINARY BLADDER. 621 coats, and the same in kind as the vas deferens (p. 567.1 special and vasa deferentia are covered by a muscular layer of a cover- transverse and longitudinal involuntary fibres. The trans - muscL verse are the more superficial (the base of the bladder being fibres; upwards), are strongest near the prostate, and act most on the vasa deferentia. The longitudinal fibres, placed chiefly on the sides of the vesiculae, are continued forwards with the common seminal ducts to the urethra. The ttzwcow^ ^nd a membrane is thrown into ridges by the bending of the tube, ^"t^""^ and presents an areolar or honeycomb appearance: it is lined by a laminar epithelium. In the sacculated part of the vas deferens the mucous lining resembles in a slight degree that in the vesicula. Common seminal ducts.—These tubes (right and left) seminai are formed by the junction of the duct of the vesicula how' * seminalis with the vas deferens of the same side, and convey the semen to the urethra. They begin opposite the base of Extent, the prostate, and are directed upwards and forwards through an aperture in the circular prostatic fibres, and along the course, sides of a hollow (vesicula prostatica), to open into the urethral tube. Their length is rather less than an inch, and length, their course is convergent to their termination, where they and are close together in the floor of the urethra (p. 625.). S'""" Structure. — The wall of the common duct is thinner struc- than that of the vas deferens, but it possesses similar coats. It is surrounded by longitudinal involuntary mus- ' cular fibres, which blend with the submucous stratum of the urethra. THE BLADDER. After the bladder has been separated from the surrounding Bladder parts, its form, and the extent of its dijfferent regions can be the more conveniently observed. ^^'^y* Whilst the bladder is in the body, it is conical in shape, Form, and rather flattened from before backwards ; but it is now more circular than when in its natural position, and has lost that arched form by which it adapts itself in distension to the curve of the pelvis.

Ordi- narily the bladder holds about a pint, and as a general rule it is larger in the female than in the male. Coats of Structure. — A muscular and a mucous coat, with an the . . ^, bladder, intervening fibrous layer, exist in the wall of the bladder: at parts the peritoneum may be also enumerated as a con- stituent of the wall. The vessels and nerves are large. ^erito. The imperfect covering peritoneum has been described (p. 594.), and has been removed. iar"hTs' muscular coat is formed of thin strata of unstriated snSa- ^^scular fibres, viz. an external or longitudinal, a middle or circular, and an internal or submucous. of\ongf ^' ^^^^ longitudinal fibres form a continuous covering, tudina!, -^vith the usual plexiform disposition of the bundles of mus- cular fibres, and extend from the apex to the base : above some are connected with the urachus, and others are inserted into the peritoneum; and below they are attached chiefly to the fascia covering the prostate, with the exception of an attach- anterior fasciculus on each side, which is united to the back raents ' of the pubes, through the anterior true ligament of the bladder. On the front and back of the bladder the mus- cular layer is stronger, and its fibres more vertical, than on forms the lateral parts. Sometimes this outer layer of fibres has urins; bccu Called detrusor urince^ from its action in the expulsion of the urine. internal The Circular fibres are thin, and scattered on the body ?ar gTves* of the bladder; but around the cervix they are collected sphinc- into a thick bundle, called the sphincter vesiccB, and are then continu- contiuuous with the fibres of the prostate.

The projection of the uvula vesicas is due to this submucous stratum. The different muscular strata communicate freely, so that strata one cannot be separated from another without division of joined, the connecting bundles of fibres. In both sexes the dis- f/.^g^f^^ position of the muscular fibres is similar.* ^^^^^ Fibrous coat,—This stratum is placed between the muscu- Fibrous lar and mucous layers, and is enumerated amongst the coats of the bladder; it is composed of areolar and elastic tissues as in other hollow viscera, and in it the bloodvessels ramify. Dissection, — The bladder is now to be opened by an Open incision down the front; and the same cut is to be continued bladder.; along the upper part of the prostate gland. The mucous membrane of the bladder is continuous pos- Mucous teriorly with that lining the ureters, and anteriorly with that of the urethra. It is very slightly united to the muscular has folds layer in consequence of the intervention of the submucous stratum, and is thrown into numerous folds, in the flaccid state of the viscus, except over a small triangular surface except behind the opening into the urethra. The membrane is soft spot."^ and smooth to the feel, and of a pale rose colour in the healthy state. Its surface is studded with small mucous Follicles, follicles, particularly towards the neck of the bladder. A f^^^' spheroidal epithelium covers the surface. Interior of the bladder, — Within the bladder the follow- interior ing parts are to be remarked, viz., the orifices of the ureters bladder, and urethra, with the triangular space. Orifices, — At the lower and anterior part of the bladder Opening is the orifice of the urethra, surrounded by the prostate thra^*^" gland. The mucous membrane presents here some longi- tudinal folds, and the aperture is partly closed by a small prominence below, uvula vesicce, occasioned by a thickening with its of the submucous muscular layer. This eminence is placed in front of the middle lobe of the prostate, and from its anterior part a slight ridge is continued on the floor of the urethra.

Trigone Triangular surface, — Immediately behind the orifice of bladder J the Urethra is a smooth triangularly-shaped part of the bladder, which is named trigone (trigonum vesicae). Its bound ^P^^ reaches the prostate, and its base the ureters; or its boundaries may be marked out by a line on each side from the urethra to the ureter, and by a transverse one behind be- part cor- tween the ureters. This space corresponds with the interval respond- ^ ^ ternauy ^^^^ bladder, between the prostate in front and the vesiculae and vasa deferentia on the sides; and over it the mucous coat is closely united to the fibrous and muscular, so as to prevent the accidental folds found in the other parts of the empty bladder.

Muscular Ending of the ureters, — As soon as the ureter pierces the ureters, outcr and middle coats of the bladder, its longitudinal fibres are thus disposed: — the more internal and strongest are directed transversely, and join with the corresponding fibres of the other urine tube, whilst the remainder are directed down over the triangular space and join the submucous layer.* Arte- Bloodvessels and nerves. — The source of the vesical arteries^ and the termination of the veins are before detailed (p. 609. 613.). In the bladder the vessels are disposed in greattist number about its base and neck. Most of the nerves that are distributed to the bladder, though supplied from the pelvic plexus of the sympathetic (p. 616.), are derived directly from the spinal nerves. nes * Trans, of Med. Chir.

Urethra. — The tube of the urethra extends from the Urethra: neck of the bladder to the end of the penis, and has an aSSd" average length of about eight inches. In that extent the^^"^^^* canal is supported by the prostate, by the spongy structure of the penis, and by muscular fibre, so that it does not "o^^.^^ require so thick a continuous muscular coat as in many coat, other excretory tubes. The size of the urethra varies at different spots, and the tube is divided, as before said (p. 599.), Division into a prostatic, a membranous, and a spongy part. parts. Dissection.— To open the urethra, let the incision through How to ^ ^ ^ open the the upper part of the prostate be continued onwards to the urethra, extremity of the penis, so as to divide the corpus caverno- sum of that body rather on one side of the middle line, and to leave uncut the septum in it. The prostatic part is nearer the upper than the lower Prosta. aspect of the gland that surrounds it, and lies at first above the middle lobe of the prostate. It is about one inch and a Dimen- sionsand quarter in length, and is altogether the widest and most ex- tensible division of the urethral canal. The form of this shape; part of the tube is spindle-shaped, for it is larger in the middle than at either end. Its transverse measurement, at diame- the neck of the bladder, is about a quarter of an inch ; at its ^ centre a line or two more; and at the front rather less than at the back. On the floor of the passage, at the neck of the bladder, is On the the eminence of the uvula vesicae. In front of this is a crest, central longitudinal ridge of the mucous lining, about three quarters of an inch in length and larger behind than before, which is prolonged anteriorly towards the membranous part of the canal, and is named crest of the urethra (veru mon- tanum, caput gallinaginis) ; it is formed like the uvula, by a bundle of the submucous muscular fibres. In the central in the fold or crest of the mucous membrane, near its posterior pouch, extremity, is a slight hollow named vesicula prostatica or sinus pocularis. The depression in the mucous fold, or the vesicula pro- Vesicu. statica, is a csecal appendage to the urethral canal, and is jectsTnto directed backwards and downwards in the substance of sta^te/°626 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. the prostate, for the distance of a quarter of an inch or less, passing beneath the middle and between the lateral lobes ; its orifice in the urethra is about a line wide, and its closed extremity is dilated. In its wall, on each side, and in it IS contained the common ejaculatory duct, which opens by a ej^acuia- narrow slit on or within the free margin of the mouth of the ducts, sac. Small glands open likewise on the surface of the mucous membrane lining it. Some bristles should be intro- duced into the ejaculatory ducts, to render evident their position and apertures. Prosta. On each side of the central ridge or crest is an excavation nuses which is named the prostatic sinus. Into this hollow the floor. greater number of the ducts of the prostate open ; whilst the apertures of others are seen at the posterior part of the central ridge, behind the hollow in it. Mem. The membranous part of the urethra is nearly an inch in branous _ . _ . , . ^ _ part. length, and intervenes between the apex oi the prostate gland and the bulb of the corpus spongiosum urethrae. In Dimen- its interior are slight longitudinal folds. This is the nar- rowest portion of the whole canal, with the exception of the orifice, and measures rather less than a quarter of an Parts inch across. It is the weakest of the three divisions of the around. . i i i • « . canal, and is supported by a thin stratum of erectile tissue, by a thin layer of involuntary circular fibres (p. 457.), and outside all by the compressor urethras muscle. Spongy The spongy part includes the rest of the urethra, viz. to the end of the penis. It is about five inches in length, and its strength depends upon an enveloping material, named Dimen. corpus Spongiosum urethrae. The average size of the canal ^ * is about a quarter of an inch in diameter, though at the vertical slit (meatus urinarius), by which it terminates on the glans penis, the tube is smaller than at any other part of Two di. the urethra. Two dilatations exist in the floor of the spongy tions: portiou : — one is contained in the bulb or bulbous part of bulb, the urethra, and is named sinus of the bulb ; the other is glans. situate in the glans penis, and has been called fossa navicu- Lacuna, laris from its shape. Many small pouches or lacunce are seen in the interior of the canal, chiefly along the floor, as far back as the membranous part, and have their apertures One turned towards the outer orifice of the urethra. One of than the tlicsc is larger than the rest, lacuna magna, and is placedSTRUCTURE OF THE URETHRA. 627 s s 2 generally on the upper aspect or the roof of the urethra, opposite the fossa navicularis. The ducts of Cowper's Ducts of glands open on the mucous membrane : they are two in of'c"ow. number, and terminate, one on each side, on the floor of the urethra near the front of the bulb, but in the ordinary ex- amination they are seldom to be recognised. Mucous lining of the urethra, — The mucous membrane of Mucous the urethra is continued into the bladder, as well as into the SX": ducts opening into the canal, and joins in front the tegu- mentary covering of the glans penis. It is of a reddish colour; colour in the spongy and membranous portions, but in the prostate it becomes whiter. In the spongy and membranous parts it is thrown into longitudinal folds during the con-folds, tracted state of the penis. Its surface is studded with follicles, glands; and with the apertures of mucous glands; and is provided with papillae towards the external orifice. Its epithelial ^y^'^^' covering is of the columnar kind, but near the meatus ex-'""' ternus this becomes laminar. Submucous tissue, ^^enQ2iih the mucous lining of the submu- urethra is a stratum of longitudinal involuntary muscular tTssue; fibres mixed with elastic and fibrous tissues. It is continuous nature; behind with the submucous fibres of the bladder, and is joined in the prostate by the fibres accompanying the common seminal ducts. ^ This structure differs in quantity along the canal. It is most developed in the prostate, where it ^'enUn" forms the projection of the crest and blends with the cir- ^^^^^^^^ cular fibres of that body. In the membranous portion of the canal the muscular structure is less abundant. In the spongy part the submucous structure is richer in fibrous in elements ; and the muscular fibres end in the usual way in the submucous tissue towards the outer orifice.* In the prostatic and membranous divisions of the urethra Erectile there is, in addition, a thin enveloping layer of vascular or through- erectile tissue, which is continued backwards from the corpus spongiosum urethra to the neck of the bladder. ^ Structure of the Penis. — The form and the connec- P^ms^ tions of the penis having been described at page 600., it re- of'two'^ mains now to notice the tissues of which it is composed, erectile The section already made through the penis shows this body ^""^'^^ * For farther detail refer to the Paper before mentioned,DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 628 to be made up of two masses of spongy and vascular tissue incased in fibrous coverings — one constituting the corpora cavernosa, the other the corpus spongiosum urethrae. Cavern- Covpova cavemosa. — Each corpus cavernosum is con- ous ma- terial; structed of a firm tunic, which encloses a cavernous or tra- the ' struc- becular structure, and contains a plexus of vessels in the tures of . . which it intervals of the spongy mass. An incomplete median septum exists along the body of the penis between the corpora cavernosa. A case The fibrous case of the corpus cavernosum is a white, strong, elastic covering, from half a line to a line in thick- that ness. Along the middle line of the penis a septal process is process" scnt inwards from it; and numerous other finer bands or trabeculas of the spongy structure are connected with its Fibres inner surface. It is formed of white shining fibres that are form strata: disposcd in two layers, outer and inner. The outer stratum is formed of longitudinal fibres arranged as involuntary inner muscular tissuc, with close meshes. The inner stratum con- septum, sists of circular fibres, with a like plexiform arrangement; and the circular fibres of each cavernous body meeting in the middle line give rise to the septum penis.* Both strata are inseparably united by communicating bundles, as in the intestine.

Bloodvessels. — The bloodvessels of the penis are laro-e vessels ^ ^ are erec in size, and serve to nourish as well as minister to the func- tiie tion of the organ. Having entered the cavernous mass, they ramify in the interstices of the trabecular structure, and end in the venous plexuses. The arteries of the corpora cavernosa are offsets of the source . of the pudic, both at the root and along the body of the penis, arteries.: Entering the cavernous structure, they divide into branches, which ramify in the trabeculae, becoming finer and finer, until they cease in one of the two following ways: — The termi- *^ to J nation greater number of the vessels terminate in capillaries, as in jn capu- other parts; but Valentin states that some of the smallest arterial branches open by large orifices into the veins in the intertrabecular spaces, without the intervention of capil- laries. Others of the terminal twigs end in tufts of short, slisrhtlv curled vessels — the helicine arteries of Miiller, the ^ 'f ' hehcine which project into the intertrabecular spaces, and are im- arteries, bedded in the coat of the thin veins: these twisted vascular bodies have dilated caecal parts; they then become finer and end in the venous spaces (KoUiker). The helicine ar- teries exist in greatest number at the posterior part of each corpus cavernosum. The veins fill the interspaces of the areolar structure, and Veins ^ are di- anastomose freely together to form venous plexuses. In ^ated ° . ^ and form these spaces the walls of the veins are very thin, because plexuses, they receive support from the surrounding fibrous structure. Into the large radicles of the veins the capillaries pour their contents; and the erectile condition of the corpus cavernosum is produced by the distension of those receptacles. By means of the apertures in the septum, the veins of opposite sides communicate freely. Most of the veins of the corpus cavernosum issue along Ending the upper and under aspects of the penis, to end in the veins, dorsal vein; but some escape near the roots of the body, and join the pudic vein and the prostatic plexus.630 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. Spongy^ Corpus spougiosum urethrcE, — This constituent part of of the the penis surrounds the urethra, and forms behind the bulb and in front the glans penis (p. 601.). The urethra is not enveloped equally on all sides by this tissue, for, at the bulb, only a thin stratum is above the canal. Posteriorly an offset of the corpus spongiosum is continued beyond the bulb, around the urethra, its Structure, — The tissue of the corpus spongiosum is ture like similar to that of the corpus cavernosum ; thus it consists of ous. " a fibrous tunic, enclosing a trabecular structure and a plexi- form arrangement of the bloodvessels. The The fibrous covering is less dense and strong than in the cSe."* corpora cavernosa, and consists only of circular fibres. A i^per- piece projects inwards from it in the middle line, opposite septum, the tube of the urethra: this is best marked for- a short dis- tance in front of the bulb, and assists in dividing that body into two lobes. The trabecular bands are much finer, and more uniform in size, than those of the corpora cavernosa. Blood- Bloodvessels, — The terminal arrangement of the blood- likewise vcssols in the erectile structure of the corpus spongiosum is almost identical with that in the corpora cavernosa; but the and he- hclicine terminations of the arteries are absent from the licine. glans penis, where the veins form a very close and regular plexus. Source The arteries are derived from the pudic on each side; ries. they are the artery of the bulb, and offsets from the dorsal artery, and enter the spongy structure — the first behind, and the latter in front at the glans where they most abound. Kobelt describes another branch to the bulb, at the upper aspect. Termi- Most of the veifis, including those of the glans, end in the nation o ^^^^^ dorsal vciu of the penis, and some communicate with veins, those of the cavernous body; others issue from the bulb, and terminate in the pudic vein and the prostatic plexus. • Nerves.

The superficial lymphatics join the inguinal glands; the deep accompany the veins beneath the arch of the pubes, to end in the glands in the pelvis.THE RECTUM. 631 s s 4 THE RECTUM. The lower end of the lar^e intestine, which is contained Rectum . .is in the pelvis, is not sacculated like the colon, but is smooth smooth, on the surface. Dissection. — The rectum is to be washed out, and then To pre- distended with air; and the peritoneum and the loose lat are gut. to be removed from it. The rectum is about eight inches in length, and its Length; average diameter is that of the sigmoid flexure of the colon. Its size is uniform till towards the lower extremity, where it g™g"" is dilated, particularly in old people, but at the aperture of termination in the anus the gut is smaller than in any other part of its extent. The longitudinal bands of the colon are absent from this portion of the alimentary canal, and the fibres are spread over the surface. Structure. — The rectum, like the rest of the larsre in- ' o coats as testine, contains in its wall a peritoneal, a muscular, a ^^J^^^ mucous, and a submucous stratum. In it the muscular and J^^,.^"- ' testme. the mucous layers have certain peculiarities that serve to distinguish this from other parts of the intestinal tube. The peritoneum forms but an incomplete covering, audits Perito- arrangement is referred to in the description of the connec- tions of the pelvic viscera (p. 594.). The muscular coat consists of two planes of fibres, as in ^^uscu- ^ ' lar coat the oesophagus, viz. a superficial or longitudinal, and a deep or circular: these fibres belong to the pale or unstriated kind. The longitudinal fibres are continuous with those in the gftu^^i";^ bands on the colon, but are here difi'used to form a stratum around the gut. The circular fibres describe arches around the intestine, ^"f ' cular and become thicker and stronger towards the lower ex- tremity, where they are collected into the band of the internal sphincter muscle. The mucous coat is more moveable than that in the colon, ^"^^"^ and resembles in this respect the lining of the oesophagus; it is also thicker and more vascular than that of the rest of f^f^ the large intestine. When the bowel is contracted the ^^^^^^^r. mucous lining is thrown into numerous accidental folds, J^""}^^632 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. some of which near the anus are longitudinal. But there some are other three or four permanent folds, described by Mr. manent. Houston, which are half an inch or less in width, and con- tain some of the circular fibres of the gut.* The most con- stant of these is about three inches from the anus, on the front of the rectum, opposite the base of the bladder ; another is found on the right side of the intestine near the top; and the third is on the left side, midway between the other two: occasionally there is a fourth on the back of the rectum, about an inch from the anus. These folds will be seen by laying open the gut along the side, provided it is tolerably fresh. struc- The mucous membrane has the same general structure as in the colon, but towards the anus the secretory apparatus gradually disappears. Arteries. Bloodvessels.— The arteries are supplied from three different sources: they are, superior hsemorrhoidal, from the inferior me- senteric ; middle haamorrhoidal, from the internal iliac artery; and arrange- inferior hsemorrhoidal, from the internal pudic. All three sets ment of ^ superior anastomose on the lower end of the gut, and only the upper hasmor- rhoidai. rhoidal, which is the largest, requires further notice. The branches of this artery (p. 516.) about six in number pierce the muscular coat three inches from the anus, and descend between the mucous and muscular coats as far as the internal sphincter, where they end in loops like the veins, which pass from branch to branch just within Veins the anus, and form circular arterial rinajs. The veins are deficient are with- . , . out in valves, and communicate freely around the lower end of the gut. Above, they join the inferior mesenteric vein, and, through it, reach the vena portas; and, posteriorly, they pour some blood into the internal iliac vein by branches corresponding with the middle haemorrhoidal artery. Nerves; Nerves and lymphatics. — The nerves for the intestine are ob- tained from the sympathetic, and those for the sphincter, from the lymph- spinal system. The lymphatics terminate in the chain of glands on atics. the sacrum. Section YL anatomy of the viscera of the female.

In this proceeding, the the vis- student is to keep the scalpel close to the osseous boundary of the pelvic outlet, to avoid the end of the rectum, and the crura of the clitoris that are connected to the bone. After and pre- pare the parts referred to are taken from the body, the rectum is them, to be detached from the uterus and the vagina, but the rest of the viscera may remain united until the genital organs are examined. The bladder may be moderately distended, and the fatty tissue and the vessels are to be removed from the viscera. ORGANS OF GENERATION. The generative organs of the female are classed into ex- ternal and internal, from their position with respect to the pelvis. The external or genital organs consist of the following External parts: — the mons Veneris and the external labia, the clitoris arl^"^ and the internal labia, and the vestibule with the meatus urinarius. Within the external labia is the aperture of the vagina, with the hymen or the remnant of it. Sometimes the term vulva or pudendum is applied to these parts as a whole. Mons Veneris and labia pudendi. — In front of the pubes "^ons . ^ Veneris the integument is covered with hair, and is raised into a and slight eminence,—mons Veneris, by a layer of subjacent fat. Extending downwards from the prominence mentioned, are two folds of integument, the labia pudendi (labia major a), ^^J^j^j.^ which correspond with the scrotum in the male. Above and below, the labia are united, the points of junction being named commissures, but between them is an interval called rima. The labia decrease in thickness inferiorly; they are covered externally with a few hairs, but are lined internally with a mucous membrane provided with follicles and seba- ceous glands. In them is a dartoid tissue resembling that in the male scrotum.

Its anterior ex- prepucef trcmity is terminated by a rounded part or glans, and is covered by a fold of the skin, corresponding to the prepuce of the male, which is provided with sebaceous glands. In its composition this organ resembles the penis in the foUow- corpora mg particulars: — it consists of corpora cavernosa, which nosa, are attached by crura (one on each side) to the pubic arch, and are then blended to form one body with an imperfect pectiniform septum; and further, it possesses a corpus spongiosum, but this structure is limited to the glans clito- ridis, which it forms, and Structure. — The outer casing and the septum are alike tissue, in both penis and clitoris ; and in the interior of the clitoris is an erectile tissue, like that of the male (p. 629.).

The vaojina is a dilatable tube, which is connected with the Vagina: ^ ' ^ extent uterus at one end, and terminates in the vulva at the other. It has a curved course between the two points mentioned : and curved and the anterior and posterior surfaces of the tube are not course, equal in length, for whilst the former measures about four inches, the latter is about five or six in extent. In its position in the body the vagina is flattened from Form above downwards, so that the opposite surfaces may be in contact, but the upper end is rounded where it is joined to the uterus. Its size varies at different spots: thus the ex-and size* ternal orifice which is surrounded by the constrictor vaginae muscle is the narrowest part, the middle portion is the largest, and the upper end is intermediate in dimensions between the other two. After the vagina has been laid open by an incision along interior the upper wall, the position of the uterus in that wall, in- stead of at the extremity, may be remarked; and further, the tube can be seen to extend higher on the posterior than the anterior aspect of the cervix uteri. On the inner surface, towards the lower part, is a slight longitudinal ridge both in front and behind, named columns of the vagina. Before the has ° columns tissue of the vaorina has been distended, other transverse and rugae. ridges or rugcB may be seen passing between the columns.636 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. Wall. The wall of the vagina is thicker anteriorly, where the urethra is situate, than at any other part of the canal. Anerec- Structure,— The vaginal wall is formed by a spongy structure erectile tissue; this is covered externally by a muscular wall. layer, and lined internally by mucous membrane. At its lower end the tube is surrounded by a band of the fibres of the sphincter vaginae muscle (p. 462.). Erectile The erectile tissue is more abundant at the ends than the tissue middle of the vagina, and in greatest quantity below where it gives increased thickness to the wall, forms Two masscs of the erectile tissue, one on each side of the bulbs, opening of the vagina, have been described as the semi-bulhs by Taylor, and as the bulbi vestibuli by Kobelt. These are elongated masses of plexiform veins, about an inch in length, which are enclosed in fibrous membrane, and are situate one on each side of the vestibule, where they are covered on the outer side by the constrictor vaginas. At its upper part each is pointed, is continued to the clitoris, and commu- nicates with the vessels of that body ; whilst at the posterior con? rounded part it joins the venous plexus of the vagina. These the"buib ^^^^^^ supposed by Kobelt to be the homologue of the maie^ bulb of the corpus spongiosum urethrae in the male ; but in the female this corresponding part is split, instead of forming one piece in the middle line, and each lateral half is thrust aside towards the crus clitoridis by the large aperture of the vagina.

Glands of Bartholine. — On the outer part of the vagina, Two near the aperture at the lower end, are two small yellowish anaio- ... gous tc glandular bodies, one on each side, which correspond with Cow- Cowper's glands in the male. Each is about the size of a small bean ; it is provided with a duct, that is directed forwards to open on the inner aspect of the nympha of its own side of the body. THE UTERUS. The uterus or womb is formed chiefly of unstriped mus- ^^^^^^ ' cular fibres. Its office is to receive and retain for a fixed tion; period the developing ovum. ^ This viscus, in the virgin state, is pear-shaped, or rather form; triangular in consequence of the body being flattened, and presents inferiorly a rounded narrow part or neck. Devia- tions from the standard shape will be found in this organ in how the infant state, where the neck is larger than the body; and in the aged female, in whom there is little separation between the same two parts. Commonly the uterus measures about three inches m Diinen- length, two in breadth at the upper part, and an inch in greatest thickness. Its weight varies from an ounce to an ounce and a half. But after gestation its size and volume always exceed the specification here made of them. The upper end is convex, and is covered by peritoneum: Upper the term fundus is applied to the part of the organ above the attachment of the Fallopian tube. The lower end is small and The rounded, and in it is a transverse aperture of communication endTs between the uterus and the vagina, named os uteri (os tincceX ^"^^^^' whose margins or lips (labia) are smooth, and anterior and opening, posterior in situation, but the hinder one is the longest. Towards the lower part the uterus is constricted, and this diminished portion is called the neck of the uterus {cervix Neck; uteri); it is surrounded by the vagina, and is covered by this tube to a greater extent behind than in front.

The hody^ or the intervening part of the uterus, is more convex posteriorly than anteriorly, and decreases in size down to the neck. It is covered on both aspects by the peritoneum, except about half an inch in front at the lower sides/ part, where it is connected to the bladder. To each side^ which is straight, the parts contained in the broad fold of the peritoneum are attached, viz. the Fallopian tube at the top, the round ligament rather below and before it, and the ovary and its ligament below and behind the others.

Its thick- The thickness of the uterine wall is greatest opposite the middle of the body, and at the centre of the fundus ; but from those spots the wall becomes thinner towards the attachment h of the Fallopian tubes. In the Interior of the uterus,—Within the uterus is a small interior *^ space, which is artificially divided into two—one of the body, angular ^^^^^^^ ^^^^ ucck of the Organ. The space occupying the thebVdy ^^^3^ viscus is triangular in form, and is larger than the other.

The muscular fibres can be demonstrated at the full period There are three of gestation to form three strata in the wall of the uterus, strata viz. external, internal, and middle. The external layer con- external, tains fibres which are mostly transverse; but at the fundus and at the sides they are oblique, and there they are more marked than along the middle of the organ. Externally the fibres converge towards the broad ligament; some are in- serted into that membrane; whilst others are prolonged on the Fallopian tube, the round ligament, and the ligament of the ovary. The internal fibres describe circles around the internal, openings of the Fallopian tubes, and spread from these till they meet at the middle line of the uterus. At the neck they become transverse in direction. The middle or inter- and . . T ^ middle. venmg set oi fibres are more indistinct than the otners, and have a less determinate direction. The mucous lining is continued into the vaccina at one Mucous , ^ lining is end of the uterus, and into the Fallopian tubes at the other. In the interior of the uterus it is thin, smooth, and adherent, but without papillse. Like the mucous membrane of the intestine, it possesses tubular glands^ which may be either ^^y^^^ straight and simple, or may be twisted or branched; the aper- glands, tures of these are scattered over the surface. In the cervix Fouicies in the uteri, between the rugee, mucous follicles and glands are col- neck, lected, and near the outer opening are filiform papillae.

Its outer end is rounded and is connected with one of the fimbriae at the mouth of the Fallopian tube ; but the inner extremity is narrowed, and is attached to the side of the uterus by a fibrous cord, the ligament of the ovary, which is below the level of both the Fallopian tube and the round ligament. Glandu- Structure,—The ovary consists of a fibrous vascular Itmc. stroma of connective tissue, which contains small vesicles or *"'^^* ovisacs, named Graafian, and is enclosed within a fibrous tunic. The peritoneum surrounds the whole, except at the attached margin. A fibrous The special fibrous coat (tunica albuginea) is of some round^' thickucss and of a whitish colour, whence its name, and is adherent to the contained stroma. Sometimes a yellow spot (corpus luteum) or some fibrous cicatrices may be seen in this covering.

They are largest in size towards the size and circumference of the organ, and sometimes they may be seen projecting through the fibrous coat. Each consists of a transparent coat, and contains a fluid. Coat; The coat of the vesicle, named ovi-capsule (tunica fibrosa), is formed of fine connective tissue, and is united to the stroma of the ovary by a network of bloodvessels, which ramify in the wall of the ova: lining it is a layer of nucleated cells — the memhr, granulosa of Baer. The fluid in the interior is contents, transparent and albuminous ; and in it is suspended the minute vesicular ovum, together with molecular granules. When the Graafian vesicle is matured it bursts on the shed- surface of the ovary, and the contained ovum escapes into vesicle, the Fallopian tube. After the shedding of the ovum the ruptured vesicle gives origin to a yellow substance, corpus Form- luteum, which finally changes into a cicatrix, corpus luteum. Bloodvessels and nerves. — The ovarian artery pierces the ovary Artery; at the anterior or attached border, and its branches run in zigzag lines through the stroma. The veins begin in the follicles and tex- veins; ture of the ovary, and after escaping from its substance, form a plexus (pampiniform) near the ovary, and within the fold of the broad ligament. The nerves are derived from the sympathetic on nerves, the ovarian and uterine vessels. Fallopian Tubes. — These tubes convey the ova from Faiio- the ovaries to the ut,erus, and correspond in their ofiice with Ks; the vasa deferentia in the male. The tubes are two in number, one on each side. Each is length, about four inches in length: it is cord-like at the inner end, where it is attached to the upper part of the uterus, but ^^^^ increases in size towards the outer end, and terminates in a wide extremity, like the mouth of a trumpet. This dilated end is fringed and named corpus Jimhriatum, and the serra- temaiiy, tions of its circumference are called fimbriae : when the fim- and fim- briated. briated end is floated out in water, one of the processes may be seen to be connected with the outer end of the ovary. In j the centre of the fimbriae is a groove, that leads to the orifice j of the Fallopian tube. On opening the tube with care, the size of the contained size of ^ ^ .

Amus. Structure. — This excretory tube has the same structure as the uterus with which it is connected, viz. a muscular tunic, which is covered externally by peritoneum, and lined by mucous membrane. Fibres The muscular coat is formed of an external or longitu- Stom dinal, and of an internal or circular layer; both these are continuous with similar strata in the wall of the uterus. Mucous The mucous membrane forms some longitudinal folds, particularly at the outer end.

The surfaces of the ligament give attachment to the obturator muscles. Branches of the obturator artery and nerve perforate it. Union Pubic Articulation (symphysis pubis).— The oval pubic pubes. surfaces of the hip bones are united by cartilage, and by fibres in front of, and above the bones. They are also con- nected by a strong subpubic ligament. Anterior The anterior pubic ligament is very strong and is formed of different layers of fibres. The superficial are oblique, and cross one another, uniting with the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen; but the deeper fibres are transverse, and pass between the surfaces of the bones. Some of the deeper fibres contain cartilage cells — Kolliker. There is not any posterior band ; but beneath the periosteum there are a few scattered fibro-cartilaginous fibres, as in front, in contact with the cartilage.

Sub- The subpubic ligament (ligam. arcuatum) is a strong Figa^.^ triangularly-shaped band below the symphysis, and occupies the upper part of the pubic arch. Its fibres curve down- wards, and are attached on each side to the bone. The apex of the ligament touches the articular cartilage, and the base is turned towards the membranous part of the urethra and the muscle around it.

Direc All the parts described in Section I. are to be examined tions. in 1 ' n before the time for turning the body arrives. Position Position.—During the dissection of the front of the thigh body, the body should lie on the back, with a block of a suitable size beneath the pelvis, and the lower limbs should hang over the end of the dissecting table. The limb is to be rotated outwards, so as to make evident a hollow at the upper part of the thigh; and is to be supported in a half bent position by means of a stool beneath the foot. Objects Surface marking.—Before any of the integument is re- surface, moved from the limb, the student is to observe the chief markings and eminences on the surface of the thigh. Promi- The limit between the thiffh and the abdomen is marked nences , ^ thethigli by the firm band of Poupart's ligament inter- above, vening between the crest of the hip bone and the pubes. On the outer side the division is indicated by the convexity of the iliac crest of the innominate bone, which subsides behind in the sacrum and coccyx; and on the inner side, by the projection of the pubes, from which a line of bone (pubic arch) may be traced backwards along the inner and upper part of the limb to the ischial tuberosity. Hollow On the anterior aspect of the thigh, and close to Poupart's pa's " ligament, is a slight hollow, corresponding with the triangular ^^^^^* space of Scarpa, in which the larger vessels of the limb are contained ; and extending thence obliquely along the inner side of the limb, is a slight depression marking the situation Groove of the femoral artery beneath: the position of this arterial655 DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. trunk may be ascertained by a line on the surface from the over •I'll lemoral centre of the interval between the symphysis pubis and the artery, crest of the hip bone, to the inner condyle of the femur. On the outer side of the thigh, about four inches below the iliac ^^^^^'^^ crest and the same distance from the anterior spine, the {^^^^^an. student will be able to recognise the well-marked projection of the great trochanter of the femur. In a thin body the H^^^of head of the femur may be felt by rotating the limb inwards femur, and outwards, whilst the thumb of one hand is placed in the hollow below Poupart's ligament, and the fingers behind the great trochanter. At the knee the outline of the several bones that enter Bony into the formation of the joint may be traced with ease, nenceof Thus, in front of the joint, when it is half bent, the rounded prominent patella may be perceived; this is firmly fixed Pateiia. whilst the limb is kept in the same position, but is moved with great freedom when the joint is extended so as to relax the muscles that are inserted into it. On each side of the con. dyles of patella is the projection of the condyle of the femur, but that on the inner side is the largest. If the fingers are passed along the sides of the patella whilst the joint is half bent, they will be conducted by the condyles of the femur to the tuberosities of the head of the tibia, and to a slight hollow Tubero- between the bones. Behind the joint is a slight depression the tibia, over the situation of the ham or popliteal space; and on its Jimnd"^ sides are firm boundaries, formed chiefly by the tendons (hamstrings) of the flexor muscles of the leg. Dissection,—With the position of the limb the same as pissec- before directed, the student begins the dissection with the examination of the subcutaneous fatty tissue with its nerves and vessels. At first the integument is to be reflected only from the ™^^Vp hollow on the front of the thiffh close below Poupart's ligra- at the ^ ' ^ ' ... , topofthe ment. lo raise the skm trom this part an incision about thigh, four inches in length, and only skin deep, is to be made from the pubes along the inner border of the thigh: at its lower end another cut is to be directed outwards across the front of the limb to the outer aspect ; and at its upper end the knife is to be carried along the line of Pou- part's ligament as far as the crest of the hip bone. The piece of skin included by these incisions is to be raisedDISSECTION OF THE THIGH. 656 and turned outwards, without taking with it the subcuta- neous fat. superfi- The superficial fascia forms a general investment for the fascia, limb, and is constructed of a network of areolar tissue, with formed- adipose substance amongst the meshes. As a part of the common covering of the body, it will be found con- tinuous with that of the neighbouring regions, so that it may be followed inwards to the scrotum or labium, and upwards thick- on the abdomen. Its thickness varies in different bodies, ness varies; accordiug to the quantity of fat deposited in it; and at the diiided "PP^^ P^^* thigh it is divided into two strata (super- intotwo ficial and deep) by some cutaneous vessels and inguinal strata by r/ j o vessels, glands. The superficial of the two layers is now apparent after the removal of the skin, but its connections will be made more evident by the following dissection. To raise Dissection, — To reflect the superficial stratum of the perficial fascia, incisions similar to those in the skin are to be em- stratum, pi^y^^ , ^YiQ separation from the subjacent structures is to be begun at the lower part, where the large saphenous vein, and a condensed or membranous appearance on the under surface, will mark the depth of the stratum. The handle of the scalpel may be advantageously employed in raising the fascia along the middle line of the limb; but, where vessels and glands are not found, viz. along the outer and inner borders of the thigh, the separation of the super- ficial fascia into two layers cannot be easily made, subcu- The subcutaneous layer of this fascia decreases in thick- layer of ness near Poupart's ligament, becoming more fibrous at the fasda same spot; and at its under aspect is a smooth and mem- branous surface. It conceals the superficial vessels and the is not inguinal glands, and is separated by these from Poupart's united , . . t i i t • with ligament, so that it is unconnected to that band as it passes part's upwards to the abdomen, and is readily moved on it either ment. upwards or downwards. ^ Dissec- Dissection. — The inguinal glands and the superficial j vessels are to be next laid bare by the removal of the sur- | rounding fat, but the student is to be careful not to destroy i the deeper, very thin layer of the superficial fascia which is j beneath them, and chiefly to the inner side of the centre of j the limb. To see Three sets of vessels are to be found in the dissection657 SUPERFICIAL VESSELS. one set (artery and vein) is directed inwards to the pubes, the su. and named external pudic ; another, superficial epigastric, ^esSsf upwards over Poupart's ligament; and the third, or the superficial circumflex iliac, appears at the outer border of the limb. The large vein in the middle line of the thigh to which the branches converge, is the internal saphenous. Some of the small lymphatic vessels may be traced from one lympha- inguinal gland to another. A small nerve, the ilio-inguinal, is to be sought on the and inner side of the saphenous vein, and close to the pubes; and one of the terminal branches of the genito-crural nerve may be found a little outside the vein. Superficial Vessels. — The small cutaneous arteries at The the top of the thigh are the highest branches of the femoral from the artery, and are furnished by that trunk as soon as it enters the thigh. They pierce the deep fascia of the limb (fascia lata), and 79^^^^ are distributed in the integuments and the fflands of the saphe- . , nous. groin. A vein accompanies each artery, having the sairie name as its companion vessel, and ends in the upper part of the saphenous vein ; but the description of these veins will be given in a subsequent page (659.). The external pudic artery (superior) crosses the spermatic One ex» cord in its course inwards, and ends in the integument of pudic the penis and scrotum, where it anastomoses with offsets q^^^^^^^' the internal pudic artery. Another external pudic branch another . P • • beneath (inferior) pierces the fascia lata at the inner border of the thigh, and ramifies also in the scrotum. In the female these branches supply the labium pudendi. The superficial epigastric artery passes over Poupart's super- ligament to the lower part of the abdomen (p. 469.), and gastric? communicates with branches of the deep epigastric artery. The superficial circumflex iliac artery is the smallest of the three branches; and appearing on the outer border ofi^i^c. the thigh near the iliac crest, is distributed in the integu- ment. The superficial inguinal glands are arranged in two lines ; inguinal one set lies across the thigh, near Poupart's ligament, and two sets, the other along the side of the saphenous vein. In the lower or longitudinal collection the glands are larger than which in the upper, and receive the lymphatic vessels from the different u u658 DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. lympha- surfacG of the lower limb ; whilst the upper or transverse set are joined by the lymphatics of the penis, and by those of the lower part of the abdomen and the buttocks. The glands vary much in number and size, and not unfrequently those by the side of the vein are united together. Raise Dissection.— The deeper layer of the superficial fascia is stratum to be detached from the subjacent fascia lata, by means of super^- incisions similar to those for reflecting the subcutaneous fascia. Stratum, except that the lower cut across the thigh is not to be made so far down. The handle of the scalpel is to be employed in the separation, and the dissector is to endeavour to avoid cutting the nerves and vessels. Internal to the saphenous vein a thin membrane can be easily raised, but external to that vessel there scarcely exists a continuous layer distinct from the fascia lata. In reflecting the stratum the margin of an aperture (saphenous) in the fascia lata will be apparent. Deep The deeper layer of the superficial fascia is a very thin thrsu- membraniform stratum, which is most evident near Poupart's fasd?^^ ligament, and on the inner side of the saphenous vein. About one inch below the ligament it conceals the large saphenous opening in the fascia lata, and is there pierced by the saphenous vein with some of the ducts of the lymphatic covers fflauds. As it stretches across the opening it is connected 8aphe- ^ , . - . 11 T 1 . . nous to the circumierence,—internally by loose connective tissue, opening, externally by firm fibrous bands ; and it is connected also with the loose crural sheath of the subjacent vessels in that aperture. The part of this stratum over the saphe- nous opening is perforated by many small apertures for the transmission of the ducts of the glands, and has been named PaH; cribriform fascia from its sieve-like appearance. In a cribrl^ hernial protrusion through that opening the cribriform por- Ssda ^^^^ projected forwards by the gut, and forms one of the coverings.

To take To raisc the skin from the front of the thiffh, a cut is to away the ° ' ^^'i"* be carried along the centre of the limb, over the knee joint,659 SUPERFICIAL VEINS. to rather below the tubercle of the tibia; at its extremity a transverse incision is to be made across the front of the leg, but this is to reach farthest on the inner side. The flaps of the skin may be now reflected inwards and out- wards. The saphenous vein is first to be traced out as far as the and foi. ^ low sa- skin is reflected, but in removing the tissue from it, the phenous student should be careful of branches of the internal cuta- neous nerve that lie along it. The cutaneous nerves of the front of the thigh are to be Cuta- sought in the fat in the following positions : — On the outer nerves of margin is the external cutaneous nerve ; in the centre are thigh, the branches of the middle cutaneous nerve ; whilst at the inner margin lie the ramifications of the internal cutaneous nerve,—one small offset appearing near the upper part of the thigh, one or more about the middle, and one of the terminal branches (anterior) about the lower third. On the inner side of the knee three other cutaneous nerves and on side of are to be looked for: — One is a branch of the great saphe- the knee, nous, which is directed to the front of the patella ; another is the trunk of the great saphenous nerve, which lies by the side of the vein of the same name, close to the lower part of the surface now dissected; and the third is a terminal branch (inner) of the internal cutaneous nerve, that is close behind the preceding, and communicates with it. Small cutaneous arteries accompany the nerves. Superficial Veins. — All the veins on the anterior and super- inner aspects of the thigh are collected into one ; and this veins, trunk is named saphenous from the readiness with which it may be detected on the surface. The internal saphenous vein is the cutaneous vessel of i»ternai the inner side and front of the lower limb, and extends from "ous vein in the foot to the upper part of the thigh, where it joins the thigh femoral vein. In the part of its course now dissected, the vessel lies somewhat behind the knee joint inferiorly ; but as it ascends to its termination, it is directed along the inner side and the front of the thigh. Near Poupart's ligament it ^^f^^^^ pierces the fascia lata by a special opening named saphenous, l^l^^^^ and enters, as before said, the deep vein of the limb.

Other cutane- ous ar- teries. Cuta- neous nerves. Ilio-in- guinal Genito- crural is on front of thigh as far as the middle. External cutane- ous is spent on the outer part of the thigh by two branch- es. ies in that situation, viz. superficial pudic, epigastric, umflex iliac, terminate in it. Towards the upper the limb the veins of the inner side and the back of % thigh are most frequently united into one branch, which enters the trunk near the aperture in the fascia lata; and sometimes those on the outer side of the thigh are collected together in a similar way, so as to produce three large veins on the front of the thigh near the saphenous opening. On the side of the knee the vein generally receives a deep branch from the joint. Some unnamed cutaneous arteries are distributed to the integuments along with the nerves ; and the superficial branch of the anastomotic artery (p. 675.) accompanies the saphenous nerve near the knee. Cutaneous Nerves. — The numerous cutaneous nerves of the thigh are derived from branches of the lumbar plexus (p. 583.), and are distributed in greater abundance on the inner than the outer margin of the limb. Hio-inguinal. — This nerve (p. 583.) is small in size, and reaches the surface by passing through the external abdominal ring; it suppHes the scrotum, and ends in the contiguous part of the thigh, internal to the saphenous vein. GenitO'crural.—The crural branch of this nerve (p. 584.) pierces the fascia lata near Poupart's ligament, rather external to the line of the femoral artery. After the nerve has become superficial, it communicates with the middle cutaneous nerve, and extends on the anterior aspect of the thigh as far as midway between the knee and the pelvis. Occasionally this branch is of large size, and, reaching the outer side of the limb, takes the place of branches of the external cutaneous nerve. The external cutaneous nerve (p. 584.) is distributed on the outer aspect of the limb. At first it is contained in a prominent ridge of the fascia lata on the outer margin of the thigh, where it divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The posterior branch is soon subdivided into two or three others, which arch backwards, supplying the integuments of the outer part of the thigh as low as the middle, and the highest offsets are crossed by branches of the last dorsal nerve. The anterior branch extends to the lower half | of the thigh. It appears on the surface of the fascia lata, about j four inches from Poupart's ligament; and as it is continued to the | knee, it distributes branches laterally, but those towards the outer ( and posterior surfaces are the most numerous, and the largest in j size. Near the knee it communicates sometimes with the branch i of the great saphenous nerve.u u 3 CUTANEOUS NERVES OF THE THIGH. 66J Middle cutaneous. — The nerve for the centre of the front of the Middle thigh is a cutaneous offset from the anterior crural, and divides into ous^"^" two branches that may pierce the fascia at separate spots. It is transmitted through the fascia lata about three inches from Pou- part's lio^ament, and its branches are continued to the knee, where i.s on if o "> front of it communicates with the offset of the great saphenous nerve over the the patella. In the superficial fascia this nerve is united with the and genito-crural and internal cutaneous nerves. In some instances [h^knee. ' the nerve is inclined to the inner side of the knee, and is substi- tuted for a branch (anterior) of the following nerve. Internal cutaneous. — Derived from the anterior crural trunk, like the preceding, this nerve is furnished to all the inner side of ous the thiffh. It is divided into two branches (anterior and inner), is di- . . ^ vided that perforate the fascia in separate places. into two. a. The anterior branch becomes cutaneous in the lower third of Thean- the thigh in the line of the inner intermuscular septum, along or branch somewhat behind which it is continued to the knee. This branch is distributed in the inteojument of the lower third of the thiojh at extends to knee the inner part, as well as in that over the patella and the inner side along the of the knee joint, and is united with the branch of the internal ^^P^"^' saphenous nerve. Occasionally this part of the nerve is found below the level of the knee joint; and in that case it is larger than usual, and is joined by a small offset from the saphenous nerve. h. The inner branch perforates the fascia at the inner side of the The knee behind the internal saphenous nerve, with which it communi- ends^in cates; it furnishes offsets to the lower part of the thigh, and the ^^^l,^ upper half of the leg on the inner surface. the leg. Other small cutaneous branches for the supply of the inner side other of the thigh arise from either the trunk, or the two final branches twigs to of the internal cutaneous nerve, and appear by the side of the "artof saphenous vein, after piercing the fascia lata. One or two come ^jj^^^ into view near the upper part of the vein, and reach as far as the middle of the thigh; and one, of larger size than the rest, appears where the others cease, and extends as far as the knee. These cutaneous offsets usually communicate. Internal saphenous. — A branch of the anterior crural, like the internal two preceding, this nerve is continued to the foot, but only a nX's^' little part of it is now visible. The nerve pierces the fascia on the appears inner side of the knee, and, after communicating with the inner ^neeand branch of the internal cutaneous, pives forwards some offsets over piissesto the leg. the knee joint; finally it accompanies the saphenous vein to the leg and foot. One branch of the saphenous nerve {patellar) appears on the Abranch surface of the fascia, hiarher than the trunk from which it sprinors ^'■om it . . . , r o . over tho It is soon joined by the internal cutaneous nerve, and ends in many patella662 DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. branches over the patella; its ramifications communicate with offsets from the external and middle cutaneous, and the trunk of forms a the saphenous nerve, and form an interlacement (plexus patellce) wkh"^ over the joint. When this branch is small its place is taken by the internal cutaneous nerve. Clean Dissectiofi. — Let the fat and the inguinal glands be now face^of' removed from the surface of the fascia lata, without however cia^ala, destroying the cutaneous nerves. At the upper part of the thigh the student is to define the inner margin of the-^saphe- and de- uous Opening, by detaching the superficial fascia. The saphe- outer border is blended with the subjacent crural sheath as opening, well as with the superficial fascia; but it is only after the uniting fibrous bands are broken or cut through, that the outer semilunar margin of the saphenous opening comes into view, and the student must not expect to find it so defined as it is represented in drawings. Fascia The fascitt lata is the deep aponeurosis of the thigh. It rounds^' surrounds the limb, giving a firm sheath to it, and sends ' inwards septa between the different muscles. This mem- branous investment is of a bluish white colour, and very strength Variable thickness, though it is always stronger on the outer varies. •/ <—' than on the inner aspect of the limb, in consequence of the insertion into it of the tensor vaginse femoris and gluteus maximus muscles. In fat bodies it is sometimes so slight as to be taken away with the superficial fascia. Aper- Numerous apertures exist in the fascia for the trans- turesin ^ ^ ^ it. mission of the cutaneous nerves and vessels, and the largest of these is near Poupart's ligament, for the passage of the Pro- internal saphenous vein. The processes prolonged from cesses x x o between the Under surface form septa between, and fibrous sheaths themus- ^ cies. for the several muscles. Some of these are larger than the rest, and are named specially the intermuscular septa of the thigh: thus two, outer and inner, are fixed to the femur, so as to limit on the sides the extensors of the leg; and a third intervenes between the adductors and the flexors of the leg. The position of these partitions is marked on the surface by white lines. Con- At the upper part of the thigh the fascia is fixed to the with prominent borders of the pelvis. Taking the circumference upper of the limb, the student will find the fascia connected ex- thigh" ternally with the iliac crest; in the middle line behind with663 SAPHENOUS OPENING IN THE FASCIA LATA. u u 4 the lower end of the sacrum and the coccyx ; internally with the pubes and the pubic arch; and in front with Poupart's ligament, between the pubes and the iliac crest. At the Differ-" lower part of the thigh, behind the knee joint, it passes lower uninterruptedly to the leg; but in front of the articulation it is blended with an expansion from the extensor muscles, and is continued over the patella, though separated from the bone by a bursa, to be inserted into the heads of the tibia and fibula. Directions. — The flaps of skin that were removed from Cover ^ the the front of the thio-h, to follow the cutaneous vessels and fascia ^ except nerves, are now to be replaced, and the saphenous opening above, is to be learnt. The saphenous opening in the fascia lata receives its ap- Saphe- pellation from transmitting the saphenous vein. This aper- ^p^^^"s; ture is oval in form, and is situate rather to the inner side of tion, form, the middle line of the thigh ; it measures about half an inch and size, in width and one inch and a half in length. Its upper ex- tremity (superior cornu) is at Poupart's ligament ; and its lower extremity (inferior cornu) is distant from that struc- ture about one inch and a half, and presents a well defined margin. The inner side of the openinsr is posterior to the level i""er ^ o 1. margin of the femoral vessels; it is deficient above in a prominent sharp ; edge, for the fascia constructing it is stretched over a flat subjacent muscle (pectineus), but it is marked below by a firm and sharp border.

When the fascia has been turned inwards and some fat removed, the tube of membrane (crural sheath) will be brought into vievv^ as it descends beneath Poupart's ligament. sheath With the handle of the scalpel the sheath is to be sepa- rated carefully from the fascia lata beneath, and from the ligament in front of it; and Gimbernat's ligament on the inner side of the sheath, to which the upper end of the falci-^ form border is united, is to be defined. mirai Poupart's ligament^ or the crural arch, is a firm band, de-gimbernat's ligament. 665 rived from the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of arch; the abdomen, which stretches from the front of the iliac ^ttach- ments; crest to the pubes (p. 475.). When viewed on the surface, form; the arch has not a straight direction between its bony at- tachments, as long as the fascia lata is entire, but is curved downwards towards the thigh. Its outer half is oblique ; but its inner half is almost horizontal, and widens as it approaches the pubes, where it is inserted into the spine, as well as into the pectineal line of the hip bone for about an inch, forming Grimbernat's ligament. The space beneath parts the crural arch, between it and the innominate bone, is closed ^^^^^^^^ by the parts passing from the abdomen to the thigh, and is larger in the female than in the male. The outer half of the interval is filled by the fleshy psoas and iliacus muscles, to which the arch is so closely bound by fascia, as commonly to prevent any protrusion of intestine at this spot; and the inner half of the space is occupied by the femoral vessels and their sheath. Gimherna€s ligament. — The structure that has received Gimber- the name of Gimbernat's ligament, is the part of the tendon gament of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen that is in- of the serted into the pectineal line of the hip bone (p. 475.). It of Pou- is only a portion of the attachment of the crural arch to the ^^^^ ^' bone; but when Poupart's ligament is in its natural position, and the structure is looked at from below, this piece of the tendon appears triangular in form, with its base directed Form, outwards. Viewing it as a separate structure, it is about tio",' one inch in length. Its apex is at the pubic spine; whilst nections' its base is in contact with the crural sheath, and is blended with the fascia lata, — the part that forms the outer margin of the saphenous opening. By one margin (anterior) it is continuous with the crural arch, and by the opposite it is fixed to the pectineal line. In the erect position of the body the ligament is almost horizontal, and one surface is directed upwards to the abdominal cavity, whilst the other is turned towards the thigh. On forcibly raising the crural arch, the continuation of Gimbernat's ligament with that band will plainly appear. The crural sheath is a loose tube of membrane around the crurai femoral vessels. It has the form of a funnel which is sloped unequally on the sides: the wide part or base of the tube is shapeDISSECTION OF THE THIGH. 666 turned upwards; and tlie narrow part ceases about two n"ction"s" ^^^^^^ below Poupart's ligament, by blending with the common areolar sheath of the bloodvessels. Its outer border is nearly straight, and is perforated by the genito- crural nerve. Its inner border is oblique, and is pierced by the lymphatics and the saphenous vein; this part of the sheath appears in the saphenous opening, and is connected to the falciform margin and the superficial fascia. In front of the crural sheath and behind it is the fascia lata of the how thiffh.

Deep Crossing the front of the crural sheath below the arch of arch. Poupart's ligament, is a thickened fibrous band, which has been named the deep crural arch. This band is supposed to occasion sometimes the stricture of the subjacent intestine in a femoral hernia. A notice of it is given with the description of the fascia transversalis (p. 485.). Open Dissection, — The student may open the sheath by an crural incisiou across the front, and raise the loose anterior part with hooks. A piece of the areolar investment of the femoral vessels is to be cut out over the situation of both the artery and the vein. When this has been done two thin partitions may be defined; one is on the inner side of the vein separating it from a gland, the other is between the vein and the artery. A fatty stratum may be seen over the upper aperture of the sheath, closing the tube towards the abdomen. Contents The interior of the crural sheath is occupied by the ofthe 1. sheath, femoral vessels, and is divided into three compartments by two partitions. The position of those septa has been before referred to, — one being internal to the femoral vein, and the Space other between the two large vessels. In the outer compart- into ment is the femoral artery, lying close to the side of the parts. sheath ; in the middle one is the femoral vein; and in the inner one (crural canal) is only a lymphatic gland. The femoral vessels are surrounded by a common covering of areolar tissue, which is distinct from the crural sheath now described.667 THE CRURAL CANAL. Crural canal. — This term is applied to the innermost The in- space in the interior of the crural sheath. Its extent is from the three a quarter to half an inch, for it reaches only from the base the cru.^ of Gimbernat's ligament to the upper cornu of the saphenous opening. Anterior to the sheath at this part, and conse- ^^''^^^'^^^^^ quently to the space, are Poupart's ligament and the upper around end of the falciform margin of the saphenous opening ; whilst behind it is the pectineus muscle, covered by fascia lata. On the outer side is the femoral vein. The aperture by which it communicates above with the cavity of the abdomen is named the crural ring. Through this canal or space the intestine in femoral hernia passes from the ab- domen. Some writers apply the term crural canal to the whole of the P^^"?: , tion of space included in the funnel-shaped sheath, and describe therefore term^ . the femoral vessels as being in the crural canal; but the appellation canal crural caual is here confined, as above stated, to the space in the pioyed. " sheath internal to the vessels. The crural or femoral ring is the upper opening of the Crurai crural canal towards the abdominal cavity.* It is on a level situa- with the base of Gimbernat's ligament, and is larger in the fo?mf"^ female than in the male. It is oval in shape ; and its greatest measurement is from side to side, in which direction it equals about half an inch. The structures that surround struc- T . . tures the opening, outside the crural sheath, are nearly similar to around, those bounding the crural canal, viz. in front the crural arch with the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female; behind, the pubes covered by fascia lata; on the inside Gimbernat's ligament; and on the outside the femoral vein within the sheath. The position of the several sides of the ring is stated at p. 498. Septum crurale, — The part of the subperitoneal layer of Crurai . . . . septum; fat, which is placed over the opening of the crural ring, has been named crural septum (Cloquet) from its position po^i^^^" between the thigh and the abdomen.

Might not the nomenclature employed be made more to resemble that used in describing inguinal hernia, by caUing this the internal crural aperture, and the saphenous opening the external crural aperture ?DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. 668 Femoral Femoral Hernia. — Tliis kind of hernia consists in a pro- trusion of the intestine into the thigh beneath Poupart's i^efini- ligament. In this affection the gut descends always in the crural sheath, and commonly on the inner side of the vein, though occasionally it may be situate on the outer side of the artery. Course; Course, — At first the intestine takes a vertical direction first ver- in its progrcss from the abdomen to the surface of the body, and passes through the crural ring, and along the crural next canal as far as the saphenous opening. At this spot it for- changes its course, and is directed forwards ; and should the and then gut protrudc Still farther the hernia again alters its direction upwards. asccuds towards the abdomen, in consequence of the ascent being easier than the descent on the front of the thigh. The winding course of the hernia must suggest to the dissector the direction in which attempts should be made By what to replace the intestine in the abdominal cavity. With the is to be view of making the bowel retrace its course, it will be neces- back. sary first to press it down towards the saphenous opening, and afterwards backwards and upwards towards the crural canal and ring. The previous dissection will have demon- strated the necessity of raising the limb, and rotating it inwards during the manipulation to return the displaced in- testine to its cavity, in order that the margin of the saphe- nous opening, and the other tissues may be relaxed. Cover- Coverings, — As the intestine takes the course above ings for the gut^^ specified it is clothed by the following structures, which are elongated and pushed before it: they are here enumerated from within outwards, in the order in which they are re- ceived.

The several vessels that may be wounded in attempting to relieve the deep stricture are enumerated at page 498. Dissection, — The triangular space at the top of the thigh clean will be prepared by removing the fascia lata from the hollow Scarpa's near Poupart's ligament, and cleaning the parts that then lar^"^"" come into view. The muscular boundaries on the sides may be first dissected; then the remains of the crural sheath are to be taken away, and the femoral vessels to be followed downwards as far as the sartorius muscle. On the outer side of the vessels the divisions of the anterior crural nerve are to be sought, together with the branches of an artery (profunda) which are buried in the fat. All the fat is to be cleared out of the space ; and in removing it from beneath the femoral artery, the student is to look for one or two small nerves to the pectineus muscle. The TRIANGULAR SPACE OF SCARPA is situate at the Trian- gular upper part of the thigh, and is beneath the hollow observ- space^at able on the anterior aspect, near Poupart's ligament. It the ^ corresponds with the axillary space in the upper limb. Com- monly its extent is somewhat less than that of the upper third of the thigh ; but its length varies according to the extent; breadth of the sartorius, and the height at which this muscle crosses inwards. The base of the space is at Poupart's ligament, and the apex at the meeting of the sartoriusDISSECTION OF THE THIGH. 670 with the adductor longus muscle. Bounding the hollow on the outer side are the conjoined psoas and iliacus, for about two inches, and below these is the sartorius; on the inner side are the pectineus and adductor longus muscles, and between and behind them near the femur, is a small part of the adductor brevis. Contents. In this spaco are contained the femoral artery and vein, and the anterior crural nerve, and some of their branches, Femoral with a Considerable quantity of fat. The femoral artery * runs through the centre of the hollow, and supplies some small cutaneous branches, as well as a large deep offset, the and their profunda: a small offset (superficial pudic) is directed from es. it to the pubes across the inner boundary. On the inner side of the artery is the vein which is here joined by the Anterior saphenous and profunda branches. Nearly half an inch ex- nerve, ternal to the vessel is the large anterior crural nerve, which lies deeply at first between the iliacus and psoas, but after- wards becomes more superficial and divides into branches. Femoral Femoral Artery. — This vcsscl is a Continuation of the external iliac artery of the abdomen, and retains the term femoral only for a given distance in the thigh. It reaches extent; from the lower border of Poupart's ligament to the margin of the opening in the adductor magnus muscle; and it occupies the front and the inner part of the thigh for only two-thirds of the length, for at the spot mentioned it turns course, backwards into the ham, and takes the name popliteal. The course of the vessel will be indicated, during rotation out- wards of the limb, by a line drawn to the inner side of the internal condyle of the femur, from a point midway between Position the symphysis pubis and the anterior iliac spine. In the femur, upper part of its course the artery lies rather internal Division to the head of the femur, and is comparatively superficial, parts, being uncovered by muscle; but, in the lower part, it is placed along the inner side of the shaft of the femur, and is beneath the sartorius muscle. This difference in its con- nections allows of a division of the arterial trunk into two parts; viz. one in the upper, and one in the middle third of the thigh. The The artery in the upper third of the thigh is contained parTof chiefly in Scarpa's triangular space, where it is enveloped671 FEMORAL ARTERY. by the crural sheath for about two inches, and is covered thear. only bj the skin and the superficial fascia, and by the fascia lu^erl lata and some inguinal glands. At first the artery rests on p^J;^ the psoas muscle; and it is subsequently placed over the ^^^''""^ pectineus, though at some distance from it in this position of the limb, and is separated from it by fat, and by the pro- funda vessels and the femoral vein. Its companion vein and the anterior crural nerve have the following position with respect to it: — the femoral vein is on the inner side and Position close to it at the pubes, but lower down it is placed behind an^" the artery; the anterior crural nerve is on the outer side, ' being distant nearly half an inch near Poupart's ligament, and some of the branches of the nerve approach the artery near the apex of the containing space. The branches of this part of the artery are the superficial branch, epigastric and circumflex iliac, two superficial pudic, and p^^f the deep femoral branch; the cutaneous offsets have been ^^enf ^ seen (p. 657.), with the exception of tlie following, which is beneath the fascia lata. The inferior superficial pudic artery arises separately one su- from, or in common with the other pudic branch (superior) pud^c!'^ (p. 657.). The course of this artery is inwards over the benelth pectineus muscle to the scrotum or the labium pudendi, ac- fa'cia, cording to the sex: it perforates the fascia lata at the inner border of the thigh to reach its place of destination. In the integument it anastomoses with branches of the superficial peringeal artery. The deep femoral branch, or the profunda, is the largest ^^dthe offset of the femoral artery* and arises from the outer part d"'""" of that vessel, one inch to two inches (Quain) below Pou^ part's ligament. This branch is consumed in the muscles Origin of the thigh, and its distribution will be afterwards ascer- tained. In the present dissection it is seen to be placed ^"dpo- over the iliacus muscle, where it gives the external cir- sca?pa" cumflex artery to the outer part of the thigh ; and then to be directed, with a large vein, beneath the trunks of the femoral vessels to the inner side of the limb. * Some anatomists apply the term common femoral to the part of the vessel above the origin of the profunda, and give the names super- facial and deep femoral to the nearly equal parts into which it dividesDISSECTION OF THE THIGH. Femoral Femoral Vein. — TliG principal vein of the limb, whilst firSin- in the triangular space in the upper part of the thigh, has llterV? almost the same relative anatomy as the artery. Its position to the artery is not the same, however, throughout: for beneath Poupart's ligament it is on the inner side of that trunk, and on the same level, and is supported on the pubes after, between the psoas and pectineus muscles ; but it soon winds mlsL beneath the artery, and appears on the outer side opposite the upper border of the adductor longus muscle. In this space the vein receives the internal saphenous and the deep femoral branches. Pecu- Peculiarities in the vessels.—Change in position.—Four examples liarities transference of the femoral trunk from the front to the baek of the thigh have been recorded. In those cases the artery passed from the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic notch, and accom- panied the great sciatic nerve to the popliteal space. The common deviations from the condition of the vessels in the triangular space, refer to a change in their position, or to the un- usual origin of the chief branch of the artery, in the Position of the vein. —The position of the vein with respect to TnhT the artery may be altered: for the venous trunk may be placed on the inner side through all the triangular space; or it may be slit Tein may go as to present a large vein on each side of the artery for a greater Sfded. or less extent, or one of the two veins may lie over the arterial tube. . .

Takethe Dissection.^To proceed with the deep dissection, the got the flaps of skin are to be thrown aside ; and the fascia lata is to The"''' be cut along the middle line of the thigh and knee, and to be reflected to each side, nearly to the same extent as the skin. Over the knee joint the student will find the fascia united with the tendon of the extensor muscles of the leg, soMUSCLES ON THE FRONT OP THE THIGH. 673 as to form lateral accessory ligamentous bands. The limb is to be retained in the same position as in the dissection of the other parts. In raising the inner piece of the membrane the narrow foUow muscle (sartonus) that appears should be followed to its Z'uf " insertion into the tibia, and care should be taken of the small nerves along its inner border, viz.: the two branches of the internal cutaneous above; the great saphenous andancpre- its branch below; and a plexus between the saphenous, nerTesin internal cutaneous, and obturator, at the middle of the wuhTt' thigh. The dissector is to avoid displacing the muscle whilst he is removing its sheath of fascia, or should fix it with stitches. Internal to the sartorius are some strong muscles (ad- Dissect ductors) that are inclined outwards: these are to be laid doctor;, bare ; and the student is to seek a branch of the obturator nerve to the plexus before mentioned, beneath the more superficial muscle (adductor longus), near where this touches the sartorius. On the outer side of the sartorius are the large extensor and muscles of the leg. For the dissection of these the knee is tt/eV to be bent to make tense their fibres: and an expansion, below, from the tendon to the fascia lata and the knee joint IS to be looked to. One little muscle at the upper and outer part of the thigh, tensor of the fascia lata, is to be cleaned; and a strip of the fascia, corresponding with its width, should be left along the outer aspect of the thigh: behind this slip, the investing membrane is to be divided\y one or two transverse cuts, and to be followed backwards to Its attachment to the lines on the femur.

The femoral vessels and their accompanying nerves and of are concealed by this portion of the muscle. The lower or part tendinous part lies on the internal lateral ligament of the knee joint, superficial to the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus, and separated from them by a prolongation of their synovial bursa: from its upper border there is an aponeurotic expansion which joins, over the knee, that from the extensors; and from its lower border, another which blends with the fascia of the leg. Below the tendon the great saphenous nerve appears with an artery ; and piercing it, is the branch of the same nerve.

Thus, beginning above, it arises from the root of the neck of the femur ; from the fore part and the outer surface of the root of the great trochanter ; from the line connecting the trochanter with the linea aspera; from the outer margin of the linea aspera ; from two-thirds of the line extending downwards to the outer condyle; and, lastly, from the external intermuscular septum.

By reflecting inwards and outwards that sors. ' thin prolongation the tendon will be laid bare. A strong transverse band will be likewise seen on each side of the patella ; the outer of the two is the strongest. The tendon of the extensor muscles of the leg is common Tendon as before said, to the rectus, the vastus externus, and the exten- united vastus internus and crureus. Its position is in front of the knee joint, to which it serves the ofiice of an anterior ligament.

Close to its attachment bursa beneath. to the tibia a synovial bursa is beneath it; and in its fibres the patella is situate, like a sesamoid bone in other situations. (See Ligament of the Patella.)

It may be represented by two pieces, which681 ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE. may spring from either of the two femoral trunks: or these mny be branch- derived from both trunks — one piece being obtained from each: this .'ast arrangement is most frequently found. The ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE is derived from the lumbar Nerve ot plexus (p. 584.), and supplies the muscles and the integument of the of the front of the thigh, and the integument of the inner side of the leg. Soon after the trunk of the nerve leaves is di. vided. the abdomen it is flattened, and is divided into a superficial or cutaneous, and a deep or muscular part. A. The superficial part of the nerve ends in these three From^its branches: the internal and the middle cutaneous of the thigh, ciai part arise — and the great saphenous. The middle cutaneous nerve perforates the fascia lata, middle sometimes also the sartorius, about three inches below Pou- ous; part's ligament, and extends on the surface of the thigh to the knee. Its cutaneous distribution is described at page 661. The internal cutaneous nerve sends two or more small internal cutane- twigs through the fascia lata to the integument of the upper ous; third of the thigh, and then divides in front of the femoral artery, or on the inner side, into the two following branches, anterior and inner.* Sometimes these branches, in which the nerve ordinarily ends, arise from the anterior crural trunk Jj'^hich at separate spots. The anterior branch is directed to the inner side of the knee anterior joint. As far as the middle of the thigh it lies over the sartorius, but it then pierces the fascia lata, and ramifies in the integument as before said (p. 661.). The inner branch is distributed in the integument of the inner inner side of the leg, just below the knee, but it remains beneath the fascia lata as far as the knee (p. 661.). Whilst underneath the fascia the nerve lies along the inner border of the sartorius, and joins in a plexus, about the middle of the thigh, with offsets of the obturator and internal saphenous nerves. When this branch is small it ends in the plexus just mentioned, and in twigs to the inner part of the thigh, instead of being continued onwards to the leg. The internal saphenous nerve is the largest of the three internal saphe- superficial branches; it becomes cutaneous on the inner side nous of the knee, and accompanies the vein of the same name to * This is the arrangement that is most commonly met with. — See foot note to the Second Edition, p. 624.682 DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. the foot (p. 661.).

The muscle arises by an aponeurosis, two or three inches in takes ' depth, from the lower or pubic border of the hip bone close frShe to the margin, viz. opposite the lower half of the symphysis, and the upper part of the pubic arch close to the inner margin.

The conjoined crural portion of these muscles comes beneath Poupart's ligament, and descends to be inserted by a tendon into the small tro- chanter of the femur, as well as by fleshy fibres into a special triangular surface of the bone in front of and below that eminence. Beneath the ligament the muscles occupy the interval between the ilio-pectineal eminence and the anterior i superior iliac spinous process. On the front of the psoas is the femoral artery, and between the two muscles lies the ? anterior crural nerve; whilst the fleshy mass covers the capsule of the hip joint and an intervening bursa. The pectineus and the internal circumflex artery are contiguous to the inner border; and the sartorius and vastus internus, to the outer edge of the muscles. The OBTURATOR EXTERNUS is of a conical form, with the base at the pelvis and the apex at the femur. The fibres of the muscle take origin from the outer surface of the obturator membrane for the anterior two thirds; and from the bone bounding internally the thyroid foramen, the attachment being an inch wide opposite the symphysis pubis, but lower down only half that width. From that spot the fibres areOBTURATOR MUSCLE AND VESSELS. 691 directed obliquely outwards and backwards to be inserted ji^jer- by a tendon into the pit at the root of the great trochanter.

Beginning in front, the student will meet first with where found, branches of the external cutaneous rather below the crest Crossing the crest, near its front, is an offset of the last dorsal nerve, and, farther back, another from the ilio-hypo- i gastric nerve; whilst in a line with the outer border of the j erector spinas are two or three branches of the lumbar ? nerves. By the side of the sacrum and coccyx are two or three offsets of the sacral nerves. Other The remaining cutaneous nerves are derived from the | nerves of I small small sciatic, and must be sought, beneath the fat, along the line of the lower incision, where they come from underneath J. the gluteus maximus ; some turn upwards over that muscle, ? and others are directed down to the thigh. \ Sources CuTANEOUS Nerves. — The nervcs distributed in the in- j cutane- tcgumcut of the buttock are small but numerous, and are i nerves, derived from the spinal nerves (posterior primary branches), from the branches of the lumbar and sacral plexuses, and from the last dorsal nerve. From Branches from the lumbar and sacral nerves.—The offsets from lumbar . the posterior primary branches of the lumbar nerves are two or • i three in number, and cross the crest of the hip bone at the place of attachment of the erector spin33 : they ramify in the integument covering the gluteus muscle, and some branches may be traced i and nearly to the trochanter major. The branches of the sacral nerves nenfes. perforate the gluteus maximus near its origin, and are then directed outwards for a short distance in the integument over it. These offsets are usually three in number; the largest is opposite the lower end of the sacrum, another is near the iliac crest, and the other by the side of the coccyx.CUTANEOUS NERVES OF THE BUTTOCK. 693 Nerves from the lumbar plexus.— Parts of two nerves from the From lumbar plexus, viz. ilio-hypogastric and external cutaneous, are JJiSofs^ spent in the integument of this region. The iliac branch of the through ilio-hypogastric nerve crosses the iliac crest in front of the branches piga's-" from the lumbar nerves, and extends only a short distance below ^^^^'^"^^ the crest: this branch is very variable in size, or it may be wanting. Offsets of the external cutaneous nerve of the thigh bend backwards external to the integument above the great trochanter, and cross the divi- ous. sions of the branch of the last dorsal nerve. Nerves from the sacral plexus. — Only one nerve of this plexus, From the small sciatic, sends superficial branches to the buttock. Its piexus, cutaneous offsets appear along the lower border of the gluteus through maximus ; two or three ascend round the edge of the muscle, and sciatic, are lost in the integument over the lower part; the remaining branches descend to the thigh, and will be afterwards noticed on it. The last dorsal nerve supplies the buttock by means of its lateral From cutaneous branch (p. 468.). This offset perforates the muscles of dorsal the abdomen, and crosses the anterior part of the iliac crest to be distributed over the fore part of the gluteal region, as low as the great trochanter. Dissection. — In the dissection of this region, the thin and clean unimportant deep fascia may be disregarded, in order that maxl-" the great gluteal muscle which is the most difficult in the body to make clean, may be well displayed. Supposing the student desirous to lay bare the muscle at once, let him turn aside the cutaneous nerves, and draw away and rotate in- wards the limb, to make tense the muscular fibres. Having Mode of cut through the fat and fascia down to the muscle, let him Fng.^^^^' carry the scalpel along one bundle of fibres at a time in the direction of a line from the sacrum to the femur, until all the coarse fasciculi are cleaned. If it is the right limb, the dissection may be begun at the upper border ; but if the left, at the lower margin of the muscle. The fascia of the buttock is a prolongation of that enve- Fascia loping the thigh, and is fixed to the crest of the hip bone, and buttock to the sacrum and coccyx.

At the edge of the gluteus maximus the fascia is slit to incase it. The GLUTEUS MAXIMUS is the most superficial muscle of Gluteus the buttock, and reaches from the pelvis to the upper part of mus. the femur. Its origin from the pelvis is partly osseous and T Y 3DISSECTION OF THE BUTTOCK. 694 Origin partly aponeurotic: — thus it is attached superiorly to the from innominate bone, viz. to the posterior fourth of the iliac P^^^^^' crest, and to a special impression on the bone below the crest; inferiorly it is connected with the back of the last piece of the sacrum, with the side of the coccyx, and with the great sacro-sciatic ligament; and between the inner and outer osseous attachments it is fixed into the aponeurosis covering the multifidus spinas muscle. From this origin the inserted fibres are directed outwards to their insertion : — the upper into the fibres (about two thirds) with a few of the lowest fibres end in the fascia lata of the outer part of the thigh; and the remainder are fixed into the femur in the lower part (three inches) of the line leading from the linea aspera to the great trochanter.

This hollow is situate between the attachments of the Bounda. muscles on the back of the limb to the femur, and the lateral boundaries are therefore formed in part by the muscles of the thigh (hamstrings), and in part by those of \ the leg. Thus, on the outer sid&, is the biceps muscle as outer far as the joint, and the plantaris and the external head of the gastrocnemius beyond that spot. On the inner side, as and low as the articulation, are the semimembranosus and semi- tendinosus muscles, with the gracilis and sartorius between them and the femur; and beyond the joint is the inner head of the gastrocnemius. The upper point of the ham is Limit . . rt . . above limited by the apposition of the inner and outer hamstring muscles, in the middle line of the thigh ; and the lower point, and by the union of the heads of the gastrocnemius. Stretched '^^^°^^* across this cavity is the fascia lata; and, forming the deep Deep^ boundary, or the floor, are the following parts,— the lower ary. end of the posterior surface of the femur included between the lines to the condyles, as well as the posterior ligament of the knee joint, and the popliteus muscle with the upper end of the tibia. i The popliteal space is widest opposite the knee joint, Greatest where the muscles are most drawn to the sides, and is deepest and above the articular end of the femur. In it are contained contents the popliteal vessels and their branches, and the ending of the external saphenous vein; the popliteal divisions of the great sciatic nerve, and some of their branches ; with some lymphatic glands, and a large quantity of fat. The small sciatic nerve lies over the space ; and a branch of the obtu- rator is on the artery in the bottom of the hollow. The POPLITEAL ARTERY is the continuation of the femoral Popliteal artery; trunk, and reaches from the opening in the adductor magnus extent; to the lower border of the popliteus muscle ; at this spot it terminates by bifurcating into the anterior and posterior tibial vessels.

In contact with the °'vessel, and somewhat on its outer side, lies the popliteal vein, so thit, on looking into the space, the arterial trunk is almost covered by it; but, lower down, in the interval be- tween the heads of the gastrocnemius, the vein and its branches altogether conceal the artery.

The internal artery, oftentimes very small, winds beneath the and in. tendon of the adductor magnus, and terminates in branches in the vastus internus, which supply it and the knee joint, and commu- nicate with the anastomotic artery. The inferior articular branches lie beneath the gastro- Tvvo cnemius, but are not on the same level on the two sides of the limb, for the inner one descends below the head of the tibia, whilst the outer one is placed above the fibula. Each lies beneath the lateral ligament of its own side.

On the outer side of the leg the lower half of the fibula may be felt with ease, but the upper half with more difficulty, in consequence of the prominence of the muscles of the calf. The head of this bone may be recognised below the knee ; and the lower end forms the pro- jection (malleolus) on the outer side of the ankle joint.

At the inner border of the foot, about an inch from the inner border of internal malleolus, is the prominent scaphoid bone pointing the foot, out the spot at which an amputation (that of Chopart) is practised; whilst farther forwards, by about one inch and a half, is a slight depression that marks the articulation be- tween the internal cuneiform bone and the metatarsal bone of the great toe. About the centre of the outer border of Outer the foot is the eminence of the tarsal end of the fifth meta- tarsal bone. A line over the dorsum of the foot, from the Dorsal centre of the ankle joint to the interval between the inner two toes, will be over the position of the artery of this part. Position.—For the dissection of the back of the leg the Position limb is to be placed on its front, with the foot over the side part, of the dissecting-table, and the muscles of the calf are to be put on the stretch by fastening the foot.

The superficial vessels and nerves may be either fat. cut or turned aside. The special or deep fascia on the posterior aspect of the Deep leg covers the muscles, and sends a thick process between the deep and superficial layers.

By fixing with a stitch the inner head that has been cut, the cleaning the fibres of the muscle will be facilitated. Superficial Layer of Muscles.—In the calf of the leg Muscles there are three muscles, gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris, ficial^ which extend the ankle: the first two are large, and give ^^^^^* rise to the prominence on the surface, but the last is incon- siderable in size and is chiefly tendinous. The gastrocnemius is the most superficial muscle. United Gastro- ^ cnemius below in the common tendon, it has above two distinct pieces or heads, which connect it with the condyles of the femur. The inner head of origin is attached by a large arises by tendon to an impression at the posterior aspect of the inner heads condyle, behind the insertion of the adductor magnus, and femur, by fleshy fibres to the line above the condyle. The outer head is fixed by tendon chiefly to a pit on the outer surface of the corresponding condyle, above the attachment of the popliteus muscle, and also to the upper and back part of the same condyle. These pieces are united along the middle line by a narrow tendinous slip, and terminate inferiorlv with tendo ^ Achillis. the soleus in the common tendon of insertion. One surface parts is covered by the fascia; the other is in contact with the by'S^*^ soleus and the plantaris, and with the popliteal vessels and the internal popliteal nerve.

After the muscle has been thrown down, the soleus and the plantaris must be cleaned. Soleus The SOLEUS is a large flat muscle, which is attached to both bones of the leg, and terminates, like the gastrocnemius, teched strong common tendon. It arises from the head, and bones^of uppcr third or half of the posterior surface of the shaft the leg, Qf the fibula; from the oblique line across the tibia, and from the posterior edge of this bone in the middle third; and between the bones, from an aponeurotic arch over the large below bloodvessels.

Beneath the muscle are the bones of the leg, the deep layer of flexors, and the vessels and nerves.

The fibres of the muscle arise from outer the line above the outer condyle of the femur, and from the posterior ligament of the knee joint, and soon end in the tendon which is inserted into the os calcis with or by the side of the tendo Achillis, or into the fascia of the leg. The belly of the muscle, which is about three inches in and joins length, is concealed by the gastrocnemius, but the tendon tendon, appears on the inner side of the tendo Achillis about the719 DEEP LAYER OF MUSCLES. middle of the leg.

Deep part of the fascia. — This intermuscular layer of Deep the fascia of the leg is fixed to the tibia and fibula, and theficia binds down the deep layer of flexor muscles. Beneath the feg. ^ soleus it is thin and indistinct; but below that muscle it is much stronger, and is marked by some transverse fibres near the malleoli, which give it the appearance and office of an annular ligament in that situation.

A communicating offset near the ankle joint joins in an arch, as Commu- before mentioned, with a similar branch of the posterior tibial; sometimes there is a second arch between the same vessels.- Peculiainties in the arteries.— The posterior tibial artery may be smaller than usual, or absent; its place will then be supplied below changes, in the foot by a large peroneal artery, which will be directed in- wards at the lower end of the tibia, and either join the small tibial vessel, or run alone to the sole of the foot. The peroneal artery may arise from the popliteal, or from the Origin anterior tibial artery. And its anterior peroneal branch may take ing of the })lace of the anterior tibial artery on the dorsum of the foot. JJeS" A compensating principle may be observed amongst the g^^^-^. arteries of the foot as in those of the hand, by means of tutions. which the deficiency in one is supplied by an enlarged offset of another. The posterior tibial veins beofin on the inner side of the Pos- ^ , ^ , terior foot by the union of the plantar veins : they ascend, one on tibiai each side of their artery, and unite vv^ith the anterior tibial trunks at the lower border of the popliteus, to form the large popliteal vein. They receive the peroneal veins, and branches corresponding with the offsets of the artery: branches con- nect them also with the saphenous veins. The posterior tibial nerve is a continuation of the internal Poste- popliteal, and reaches, like the artery, from the lower border tibial of the popliteus muscle to the interval between the os calcis and the inner malleolus. Whilst beneath the annular liga- ment or somewhat higher than it, the nerve divides into the Extent internal and external plantar branches of the foot. Its con- and nections with surrounding parts are the same as those of the artery ; but its position to the vessel changes, for it lies on the inner side of the posterior tibial artery above the origin P"^'j^t'°" of the peroneal offset, but on the outer side thence to the artery, termination. Its lateral branches are chiefly muscular.

Attached by Attach- a pointed part to the internal malleolus, the fibres diverge from it, and are inserted into the os calcis.

The artery supplies here small offsets to the tarsus, and the ankle joint. Occasionally the artery divides beneath or even above the ligament. The nerve is nearer than the i artery to the os calcis ; but it is sometimes bifurcated beneath the ligament, so that a nerve may lie on each side of the tibial vessels. Section Y.

The subcutaneous fat of the sole of the foot is very subcu- abundant, and forms the thickest cushion over the parts of fat. the surface that press most on the ground in standing, viz. ^ over the os calcis, and the line of the metatarso-phalangeal articulations. Dissection, — The fat should be now removed, and the Lay bare plantar fascia laid bare. Begin the dissection near the plantar heel, and follow forwards the fascia towards the toes, to each of which a process is to be traced. In the intervals between these processes the digital nerves and arteries will be found ^^.^}^^ covered bj much fatty and fibrous tissues; but the vessels and veWis nerves to the inner side of the great toe, and the outer side nerves, of the little toe, pierce the fascia farther back than the rest.

Plantar fascia* — The special fascia of the sole of the piantar foot is of a pearly white colour and great strength, and sends septa between the muscles. Its thickness varies in different parts of the foot; and from this circumstance^ and from the existence of longitudinal depressions where the two chief intermuscular septa are attached, the fascia is divided into a Division central and two lateral parts. p"r°s. The central part, which is much the thickest, is pointed central at its attachment to the os calcis, but widens and becomes ^^"^^ thinner as it extends forwards. A slight depression, corre- sponding with an intermuscular septum, marks its limit on each side. Opposite the heads of the metatarsal bones it divides divides into five processes, which send bands to the integu- pieces, ment near the web of the foot, and are then continued on- wards to the toes, one to each. If one of the processes be Termi- divided longitudinally, and its parts reflected to the sides, it of the will be seen to join, at the centre, the sheath of the flexor tendons, whilst it is attached on the sides to the margins of the metatarsal bone, and to the ligament uniting one of 3 A 3726 DISSECTION OF THE FOOT.

Inner The lateral parts of the fascia are thinner than the central the piece. On the inner margin of the foot the fascia has but fascia • little strength, and is continued to the dorsum ; but on the outer outer side it is increased in thickness, and presents a strong band between the os calcis and the projection of the fifth metatarsal bone. Expose Dissection. —To examine the septa, a longitudinal incision may be made along the centre of the foot, and a transverse one near the calcaneum. On detaching the fascia from the subjacent flexor brevis digitorum, by carrying the scalpel from before backwards, the septal processes will appear on the sides of that muscle.

The outer one, between outer. . . the short flexor and the abductor minimi digiti, is pierced by the digital nerve and artery for the outer side of the little toe.

It is a band of fibres which is attached at the ex- tremities to the great and little toes, and is connected with each of the others, as it passes over. Beneath it are the digital nerves and vessels. Sheaths shcaths of the flexor tendons are similar to those of tendon^ fiugcrs, though not so distinct, and serve to confine the tendons against the grooved bones. The sheath is weak opposite the articulations between the phalanges, but is strengthened by a band opposite the centre of both the meta- tarsal and the next phalanx. Each is lubricated by a syno- vial membrane, and contains tendons of the long and short flexor muscles. Pissect Dissection. — In the sole of the foot the muscles are727 FIRST LAYER OF MUSCLES. numerous, and have been arranged in four layers. To pre- first pare the first layer all the fascia must be taken away, but this muscles, dissection must be made with some care, lest the digital branches of the plantar nerves, which become superficial to the muscles towards the toes, should be injured. The ten- dons of the short flexor muscle are to be followed to the toes, and the sheaths in which they are contained must be opened. First layer of muscles.— In the first layer which is now Muscles visible, are three muscles, viz. the flexor brevis digitorum, four" the abductor pollicis, and abductor minimi digiti : the short Ihlfi' flexor of the toes is in the centre of the foot, and each of the iJlThe^^ others is in a line with the toe on which it acts. The ABDUCTOR POLLICIS is the most internal of the muscles Abduc- tor pol- of the superficial layer. It takes origin from the inner part licis; of the larger tubercle on the under surface of the os calcis ; origin; from the internal annular ligament, and the fibrous structures on the inner side of the foot as far as the internal cuneiform bone ; and from the plantar fascia. In front the muscle ends in a tendon, which is joined by fibres of the short flexor of the great toe, and is inserted, with the tendon of that flexor, inser- into the inner side of the base of the metatarsal phalanx of ' the great toe. The cutaneous surface of the muscle is in connec- tions. contact with the plantar fascia ; and the other touches the plantar vessels and nerves, the tendons of the long flexors of the toes, and the accessory muscle. The FLEXOR BREVIS DIGITORUM (flcXOr pcrforatus) arises Flexor posteriorly by a pointed tendinous process from the inner part d^Yo-; of the larger tubercle of the os calcis, and by fleshy fibres from the plantar fascia and its septa. About the centre of the foot the muscle ends in four small tendons; these are directed forwards over the tendons of the long flexor, and entering the sheaths of the four smaller toes, are inserted f^ll^^^ ix^to the middle phalanges. In the sheath of the toe, the 5^^" the^ tendon of this muscle lies at first (in this position) on that ^^^^ J of the long flexor; but opposite the middle of the metatarsal gjjf^^^® phalanx it is slit for the passage of the other, and is attached by two processes to the sides of the middle phalanx. The short flexor of the toes is contained in a sheath of the plantar fascia, and occupies the middle of the foot: it conceals the Connec- tendon of the long flexor of the toes, the accessory muscle, and the external plantar vessels and nerve.DISSECTION OF THE FOOT. 728 Abduc- The ABDUCTOR MINIMI DiGiTi has a wide origin behind little toe. from the outer and inner tubercles of the os calcis, and from the plantar fascia and the external intermuscular septum. Origin It cuds anteriorly in a tendon which is inserted, with the and in- sertion, short flexor of the little toe, into the outer side of the base of the metatarsal phalanx of that toe. The muscle lies along isat the outer border of the foot, and conceals the flexor acces- side of ^ ' the foot, sorius, and the tendon of the peroneus longus. On its inner side are the external plantar vessels and nerve. Dissect Dissection. — To^ bring into view the second layer of vessel^ .muscles and the plantar vessels and nerves, the muscles al- nerves. rcadj examined must be reflected. Cut through the flexor brevis at the os calcis, and as it is raised, notice a branch of nerve and artery to it; divide the abductor minimi digiti near its origin, and turning it to the outer side of the foot, seek a small nerve and vessel to it close to the bone. The abductor pollicis can be drawn aside if it is necessary, but it may remain uncut till afterwards. Now the plantar vessels and nerves are to be followed forwards to their termination, and backwards to their origin ; and the tendons of the long flexors of the toes, the accessory muscle, and the small lum- bricales, should be freed from loose tissue. Two The PLANTAR ARTERIES are the terminal branches of the plantar arteries: posterior tibial trunk. They are two in number, and are named external and internal from their relative position in inner the sole of the foot. Of the two the external is the larger ; and , , outer, and it forms the plantar arch of arteries, from which digital branches are furnished to the toes, sraau"^^ The internal artery is commonly inconsiderable in size, and is directed forwards, under cover of the abductor pollicis, ends on to the root of the s-reat toe : here it ends either in small side of ^ the foot, branches to the side of the foot, or in digital branches to the inner two toes which anastomose with the external plantar artery. External The external artery has an arched course in the foot, with hlr^ the concavity of the arch turned inwards, and supplies course; branches to the toes. Starting from the inner part of the foot, the vessel is first directed outwards across the sole, and then obliquely forwards towards the root of the great toe, or to the side on which it began, so that the vessel crosses twice the foot. In the first half of its extent, the artery is com-729 PLANTAE VESSELS AND NERVES. paratively superficial, and extends from the inner side of the paniy calcaneum to the base of the metatarsal bone of the little iScS^" toe ; in the other half it lies deeply in the foot, in contact partly with the interosseous muscles, and forms the plantar arch between the little and the great toe. Only the first part of the artery is now laid bare; the re- super- : maining part, that supplying the digital branches, will be part, noticed after the examination of the third layer of muscles (p. 733.). As far as the metatarsal bone of the little toe, connec- the vessel is concealed by the abductor pollicis and the flexor brevis digitorum, but for a short distance near its termination • it lies in the interval between the last muscle and the abductor minimi digiti.

It sup- plies offsets to the muscles between which it lies, and some Branch- . . es. branches to the outer side of the foot for anastomosis with the peroneal artery. The PLANTAR NERVES are derived from the bifurcation of Plantar nerves the posterior tibial nerve behind the inner ankle. They are also two, two in number, like the arteries, and have the same con- nections as those vessels, for each accompanies a plantar artery; but the larger nerve is found with the smaller but the ^ inner is bloodvessel. largest.

These muscles decrease in size from the inner to the outer side of the foot. The accessorius muscle has two heads of origin : — one is Flexor tendinous, and is attached to the under or the outer surface sorius of the OS calcis, and the ligamentum longum plantas; the other is large and fleshy, and springs from the inner or concave sur- face of the calcaneum. The fibres end in aponeurotic bands, is joined which join the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum about flexor the centre of the foot, so as to form a kind of groove for it.

Afterwards the areolar tissue is to be taken from the muscles now brought into view. Third Third layer of muscles.—Only the short muscles of the muscles, great and little toes enter into this layer. On the metatarsal bone of the great toe the flexor brevis pollicis lies, and ex- ternal to it is the adductor pollicis ; on the metatarsal bone Position, of the little toe is the flexor brevis minimi digiti. Crossing the heads of the metatarsal bones is the transversalis pedis muscle. The fleshy mass between the adductor pollicis and the short flexor of the little toe consists of the interossei muscles of the next layer. Flexor The FLEXOR BREVIS POLLICIS musclc is tcndiuous and brevis poj^icis pointed at the posterior part, but bifurcated in front. It is before ^^^^^^^^ posteriorly to the inner border of the cuboid bone, andjoins and to a prolongation from the tendon of the tibialis posticus muscles, to the outcr two cuneiform bones. Near the front of the metatarsal bone of the great toe it divides into two heads, which are inserted into the sides of the base of the meta- tarsal phalanx. Resting on the muscle, and in the interval between the heads, is the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. The inner head joins the abductor, and the outer is united with the adductor pollicis. A sesamoid bone is developed in the tendon connected with each head. Adduc- The ADDUCTOR POLLICIS, which is larger than the pre- lids^^^' ceding muscle, and external to it, arises from the sheath of the tendon of the peroneus longus, and from the bases of the733 THIRD LAYER OF MUSCLES. third and fourth metatarsal bones. Anteriorly the muscle is united with the outer head of the short flexor, and is in- outer serted with it into the base of the metatarsal phalanx of the head of /■ short great toe. To the inner side is the flexor brevis ; and beneath flexor, the outer border the external plantar artery and nerve are piamar directed inwards. The TRANSYERSALis PEDIS is placed transversely over the Trans, heads of the metatarsal bones. Its origin is by fleshy pedif bundles from the four outer bones and their phalangeal articulations (frequently not from the little toe) ; and its in- sertion is united with that of the adductor pollicis. The attached to ends cutaneous surface is covered by the tendons, and the vessels of the ^ ' ^ ^ toes. and nerves of the toes ; and the opposite surface is in con- tact with the interossei muscles. This muscle is sometimes described as a part of the adductor pollicis. The FLEXOR BREVIS MiNim DiGiTi is a small narrow riexor muscle ; it lies on the metatarsal bone of the little toe, and dlguna resembles one of the interossei. Attached to the metatarsal inter, bone, and slightly to the sheath of the peroneus long us, it is inserted into the outer side of the base of the metatarsal pha- lanx of the same toe, and into the inferior ligament of the metatarso-phalangeal articulation.

From its insertion processes are continued to many of the other bones of the foot. One is directed backwards to the margin of the groove in the os calcis for the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. Two offsets are directed forwards: — one is prolonged to the internal cuneiform bone ; the other, much the largest, is attached to the middle and outer cuneiform, to the OS cuboides, and to the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones.

Dissection,— To enable the dissector to raise the skin Raise the from the leg and foot, one incision should be made along the middle line, from the knee to the toes, and this should be intersected by cross cuts at the ankle and the web of the foot. After the flaps of skin are reflected, the cutaneous vessels seek the and nerves are to be looked for. At the inner part of the ous ' leg are some filaments from the great saphenous nerve, and the leg; at the outer side, others from the cutaneous ramifications of the external popliteal nerve. Perforating the fascia in the lower third, on the anterior aspect, is the musculo-cutaneous nerve, whose branches should be pursued to the toes. On the dorsum of the foot is an arch of veins, which ends on the . . foot both at the sides in the saphenous veins. On the outer side is vessels ^ , and the short saphenous nerve; and in the interval between the nerves, great toe and the next, is the cutaneous part of the anterior tibial nerve. The nerves should be traced to the ends of the toes by removing the integuments. After the several vessels and nerves are dissected, the fat is to be taken away, in order that the fascia may be seen. The venous arch on the dorsum of the foot has its con- Cutane- vexity turned forwards, and receives digital branches from veins, the toes; at its concavity it is joined by small veins from the instep. Internally and externally it joins the saphenous veins. The internal saphenous vein begins at the inner side of internal the great toe, and in the arch of veins; it ascends along the nous, inner side of the foot, and in front of the inner ankle to the inner part of the leg, where it has been before seen (659.). It receives branches from the inner side and the sole of the foot. 3 B738 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. Exter. The external saphenous vein begins on the outside of the phenous. little toe and the foot, as well as in the venous arch; it is then continued below the outer ankle to the back of the leg (p. 716.). Source CuTANEOUS Nerves. — All the Superficial nerves on the cutane- frout of the leg and foot are derived from branches of the ous , nerves, popliteal trunks, viz., from the musculo-cutaneous and ante- rior tibial nerves of the external popliteal, and from the external saphenous nerve of the internal popliteal. Some inconsiderable offsets to the sides of the leg from the internal and external saphenous do not require separate notice. Muscu- The musculo'cutaneous nerve has a cutaneous termination, and its neous' place of destination is the dorsum of the foot and toes. Perfora- certa'in^ ting the fascia in the lower third of the leg, it divides into two toes; principal branches (inner and outer), which give digital nerves to the sides of all the toes, except the outer part of the little toe and divides the Contiguous sides of the great toe and the next. The digital branches may be traced in the integument as far as the end of the last phalanx. inner The inner hranch communicates with the internal saphenous ^"^ nerve, and supplies the inner side of the foot and great toe : it joins also the anterior tibial nerve, outer h. The outer hranch divides into three nerves, which lie over the outer three interosseous spaces, and bifurcate at the web of the foot for the supply of the contiguous sides of the four toes cor- responding with those spaces : it joins the external saphenous nerve on the outer part of the foot. Anterior The anterior tibial nerve becomes cutaneous in the first inter- where osseous space, and is distributed to the opposed sides of the great found. next. The musculo-cutaneous nerve joins it, and sometimes assists in supplying the same toes. External The external saphenous uerve comes from the back of the leg nous. below the outer ankle, and is continued along the foot to the out- side of the little toe. Occasionally it supplies both sides of the little toe, and part or more of the next.

Intermuscular septa are prolonged from the deep surface, and one of these, which is attached to the fibula, separates the muscles on the front from those on the outer side of the leg. Superiorly the fascia is connected to the heads of the bones, but inferiorlj it is continued to the dorsum of the foot.

On separating the fascia from the subjacent mus- cles, let the edge of the scalpel be directed upwards. In like manner the fascia may be taken from the peronei muscles on the outside of the fibula, but without destroying the band below that bone. On the dorsum of the foot the dorsal vessels with their ciean nerve, and the short extensor of the toes are to be dissected; and ves- and, in the leg, the anterior tibial nerve and vessels are to be followed into their intermuscular space and then cleaned. The anterior annular ligament consists of two parts, Anterior I'l* • annular upper and lower, which confine the muscles m their position : liga- ment; the former serving to bind the fleshy part to the bones of the leg, and the latter to keep down the tendons on the dorsum of the foot. The upper part is attached laterally to the bones of the its upper leg, and possesses a separate sheath for the tibialis anticus. The lower part is in front of the tarsal bones. It is in- ^ lower serted externally into the upper surface of the os calcis, in part, front of the depression for the interosseous ligament; and, internally, by a thin and widened piece into the plantar fascia and the inner malleolus. In this part of the ligament sheaths 11 1 . . o 1 . - differ in there are three sheaths: the inner one is for the tibialis each, anticus; the next for the extensor pollicis; and the outer one for the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus.

The external annular ligament is attached on the one side Exter. to the outer malleolus, and on the other to the outer surface nuiar a- of the OS calcis; it contains the tendons of the peronei muscles in one sheath, which is lined by a synovial mem- brane. The MUSCLES ON THE FRONT OF THE LEG are three in Muscles number; they are flexors of the ankle and extensors of the front'of . . the leg toes. The large muscle next the tibia is the tibialis anticus; and toot.DISSECTION OF THE LEG. 740 that next the fibula, the extensor longus digitorum ; whilst a small muscle, apparently the lower part of the last, with a separate tendon to the fifth metatarsal bone, is called pero- neus tertius. The one between the tibialis and extensor, in the lower half of the leg, is the extensor poilicis. On the dorsum of the foot is only one muscle, the extensor brevis digitorum. Tibialis The TIBIALIS ANTicus rcaches the tarsus: it is thick and anticus; fleshy in the upper, but tendinous in the lower part of the origin, leg. It arises from the outer tuberosity and the upper two thirds of the tibia, from the contiguous part of the interos- seous ligament, and from the fascia of the leg and the inter- muscular septum between it and the next muscle. After passing through the innermost compartments in the annular inser. ligaments, the tendon is inserted into the under surface of the internal cuneiform bone, and sends forwards a process to p^rts^^ the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The muscle is sub- the aponeurotic. It lies at first external to the tibia, resting on muscle, . 1 • » 1 1 T .1 and on the mterosscous membrane, but it is then placed successively ' over the end of the tibia, the ankle joint, and the inner line of the tarsal bones. The outer border touches the extensor muscles of the toes, and partly conceals the anterior tibial vessels as low as the foot. Extensor The EXTENSOR PROPRius POLLicis is deeply placed at its origin between the former muscle and the extensor longus digitorum, but its tendon becomes superficial on the dorsum of the foot. The muscle arises from the middle three fifths of the anterior narrow part of the inner surface of the fibula, attached and from the interosseous ligament for the same distance. ' The tendon comes to the surface through a sheath in the lower part of the annular ligament, and then continues over the inner part of the tarsus to be inserted into the last and phalanx of the great toe. The anterior tibial vessels are to toef the inner side of the muscle as low as the sheath in the liga- th?^'^^ ment, but afterwards to the outer side of the tendon, so that ^ ^ ' they are crossed by it beneath the ligament. Extensor The EXTENSOR LONGUS DIGITORUM, like the tibial musclc, longus . ... arises jg fleshy iu the leg and tendinous on the foot. Its origin is fibula; from the external tuberosity of the tibia; from the head and three fourths of the inner surface of the fibula in front of the interosseous membrane ; from a small part (about an741 ANTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. inch above) of the interosseous membrane, and from the fascia of the leg and the intermuscular septum on each side. The tendon enters its sheath in the annular ligament with inserted into four the peroneus tertius, and divides into four pieces. Below outer the ligament these tendons are continued to the outer four toes, and are inserted by processes into the middle and ungual phalanges. On the phalanges of the toes the tendons have the same Ar- arrangement as in the hand. For, on the metatarsal pha- mem 'of lanx, the tendons of the long and short extensor join with dons on prolongations from the interossei and lumbricales to form a membranous expansion. At the further end of this phalanx the expansion divides into three parts — a central and two lateral; the central piece is inserted into the base of the middle phalanx, while the lateral ones unite at the front of that bone, and are fixed into the ungual phalanx. In the leg the muscle is placed between the peroneus on Connec. the one side, and the tibialis anticus and extensor proprius the pollicis on the other ; it lies on the fibula, and on the lower ^^^^ ^' end of the tibia and the ankle joint. On the foot the tendons rest on the extensor brevis digitorum ; and the vessels and nerve of this part are internal to them. The peroneus tertius is situate below the extensor longus pero- digitorum, from which it is seldom separate at its origin, tertius It arises from the lower fourth of the inner surface of the lower fibula in front of the membrane between the bones, from the th^ex^. lower end of the interosseous ligament, and from the inter- muscular septum between it and the peroneal muscles ; and it is inserted by a tendon into the tarsal end of the metatarsal bone of the little toe. This muscle has the same connections in the leg as the lower part of the long extensor, and is contained in the same space in the annular ligament.

The artery rests on the interosseous mem- brane in two thirds of its extent, and is overlapped by the iieshy bellies of the contiguous muscles, so that it is at a great depth from the surface ; but it is in front of the tibia and the ankle joint in the lower third, and is comparatively superficial, for it here lies between only the tendons of the muscles.

The veins have the same position with respect to the artery position as in the leg, and the nerve is external to it. and Branches. — Offsets are given to the bones and the liga- gj-^jnch. ments of the foot: those from the outer side of the vessel have received the names tarsal and metatarsal from their distribution. A small interosseous branch is likewise fur- nished to the first intermetatarsal space. The tarsal branch arises opposite the scaphoid bone, and runs Tarsal, beneath the extensor brevis digitorum to the outer side of the foot, where it divides into twigs that inosculate with the metatarsal plantar, and peroneal arteries: it supplies offsets to tlie extensor muscle, beneath which it lies. The metatarsal branch takes an arched course to the outer part Metatar- of the foot, near the base of the metatarsal bones and beneath the extensor muscle, and its terminal branches anastomose with the external plantar and tarsal arteries. From the convexity of this arch, which is turned forwards, three which interosseous arteries are furnished to the three outer intermeta- ferosse"" tarsal spaces : these supply the interosseous muscles, and divide at the cleft of the toes into two dorsal collateral branches. At the fore part and the back of each space the interosseous arteries join the deep vessels in the sole of the foot by means of the anterior and posterior perforating arteries.

The anterior tibial veins have the same extent and con- nections as the artery they accompany. They have their veins, usual position along the artery, one on each side, around which they form loops by cross branches; they end in the popliteal vein. The branches they receive correspond with those of the artery ; and they communicate with the internal saphenous vein.

It arises from the outer surface of the OS calcis in front of the groove for the peroneus brevis muscle, and from the anterior annular ligament (the sends lower band) ; the muscle ends in four tendons, which spring to four from as many fleshy bellies, and are inserted into the four toes; inner toes. The tendon to the great toe has a distinct attachment to the base of the metatarsal phalanx ; but the ^ rest are united to the outer side of the tendons of the long extensor, and assist to form the expansion on the metatarsal insertion phalanx (p. 741.). The muscle lies on the tarsus, and is ' partly concealed by the tendons of the long extensor. Its inner tendon crosses the dorsal artery of the foot.

In the leg it crosses the anterior tibial artery once or more, but its position on the foot is external to the dorsal artery. Branches, — In the leg the nerve supplies the anterior ^J"^^^^- tibial muscle and the extensor of the toes. On the dorsum muscles, of the foot it gives a considerable branch to the short ex- tensor; this becomes enlarged, and gives offsets to the articulations of the foot. Muscles on the outer part of the leg.— Only two External *^ muscles muscles are found in this situation: they are named peronei of the from their attachment to the fibula, and are distinguished by terms (longus and brevis) expressive of their relative length. Intermuscular processes of fascia, which are attached to the fibula, isolate these muscles from others, viz. from the soleus and flexor pollicis behind, and from the extensor longus digitorum in front. The PERONEUS longus is the more superficial of the two ^1^^°]^,. muscles, and passes round the outer border of the foot into g"^- the sole to end in the cuneiform and metatarsal bones. It arises from the head of the fibula; from the outer surface of the shaft of the bone for two thirds of its length, but still JJ^^'^^e farther from the posterior border: and from the fascia and fit)uia5 the intermuscular septa.

In the knee loint a kind of capsule is to be defined around a cap-' ^ ^ sule and the articular surfaces of the bones ; and there are four other the ex. ternal ligaments, anterior and posterior, internal and external, jjga-^^ which are thickened bands at their respective parts of the articulation. Some tendons, namelj, those of the biceps, popliteus, adductor magnus, and semimembranosus, are to be followed to their insertion, and a part of each is to be left. The Articulation of the Knee. — The knee is the Bones in largest hinge joint in the body, and is formed by the con- knee tiguous ends of the tibia and femur with the patella. The articular surfaces of the bones are covered with cartilage, and are maintained in apposition by the following ligaments : — A capsule surrounds the ends of the bones, and fills the Capsule intervals between the stronger special ligaments. The hnper" fascia lata is closely united with it. In front it receives vering. accessory fibres from the vasti and crureus^ and from the biceps and sartorius; and, behind, from the tendon of the semimembranosus. It is connected with the interarticular cartilages, and the tendon of the popliteus muscle per- forates it. a. The external lateral ligament is round and cord-like ; External it is attached to the outer condyle of the femur below the ligament tendon of the gastrocnemius, and descends vertically between two pieces of the tendon of the biceps to the outer part of the head of the fibula. A second fasciculus, short external lateral ligament, is sometimes found behind the other. Be- neath the ligament are the tendon of the popliteus, and the external lower articular vessels and nerve. The tendon of the biceps is inserted into the upper part of Tendon the head of the fibula by two processes, and from one of biceps is these there is a prolongation to the head of the tibia.

When the anterior part of the capsule with the pa- tella is thrown down, a fold (mucous ligament) will be seen extending from the end of the femur to the front of the joint below the patella. On each side of the knee-pan is a similar fold (alar ligament), containing some fat. The limb is afterwards to be taken from this position, and and dis- part of the posterior ligament is to be removed, to lay bare ciai wga. the crucial ligaments at the back of the joint; but the limb is to be replaced in the former position before the structures are learnt. The synovial membrane lines the interior of the capsule, synovial and is continued to the articular ends of the bones. Besides brane covering the capsule, it invests the interarticular cartilages, and sends a pouch between the tendon of the popliteus and the external cartilage and the head of the tibia: it is likewise reflected over the strong crucial ligaments at the back of the joint. On the front of the femur the sac of the membrane extends two inches above the articular surface.

The remains of the capsule and the synovial membrane are finally to be cleared away from both the crucial ligaments and the interarticular cartilages. Ligaments within the capsule,—The remaining ligamentous other n- structures, although within the capsule, are external to the within'^ sac of the synovial membrane which is reflected over them: sJe?''^' they consist of the crucial ligaments in the middle line : and of two flat plates of fibro-cartilage, the interarticular or semilunar, on the head of the tibia.750 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. Two ^ The crucial ligaments are two strong fibrous processes, liga- which intervene between the ends of the tibia and femur, and ments. , . ^ • • i l • r^^^ cnieiiy maintain those bones in contact, ihey cross one another somewhat like the legs of the letter X, from which circumstance they have received their name.

Inferiorly it is attached to the tach- inner lip of the hollow in front of the spine of the tibia, close to the inner articular suriace; and superiorly it is inserted into the back part of the outer condyle of the femur, on the inner surface, and slightly into the interval between the con- dyles. posterior The posterior ligament is almost vertical between the u \erti- ^^j^gg back of the joint. By the lower end it is fixed to the back of the depression behind the spine of the tibia, near the margin of the bone ; and by the upper extremity it is inserted into the fore part of the hollow between the condyles of the femur, and into the contiguous surface of the inner condyle.

The inter articular or semilunar cartilages are two fibre- semi. cartilaginous plates, which partly cover the articular surface cartu of the tibia : they are provided with two accessory bands ; Iwo.^ one is between them at the fore part; the other, oblique, as- cends to the inner condyle of the femur. They are thickest at the outer margin, where they are united by fibres to the capsule; and are hollowed on the upper surface, so as to assist in giving depth to the fossae for the reception of the condyles of the femur. Inserted into the tibia at their ex- tremities, they are coarsely fibrous at their attachments to the bone, like the crucial ligaments, and become cartilaginous only where they lie between the articular surfaces. The synovial membrane is reflected over them. a. The internal cartilage is ovoid in form, and is a seg- internal ment of a larger circle than the external. In front it is at- Srcu^ar. tached by a pointed part to an impression close in front of the inner articular surface of the tibia, and in a line with the anterior margin of the head of the bone. At the back, where it is much wider, it is fixed to the inner lip of the hollow behind the spine of the tibia, between the attachment of the other cartilage and the posterior crucial ligament. h. The external cartilage is nearly circular in form, and Exter- is connected to the bone within the points of attachment of neaViy its fellow. Its anterior part is fixed to the bottom of the in form, depression in front of the spine of the tibia, and close to that point of bone ; and its posterior extremity is inserted into the middle of the spine, between the two osseous points. From the posterior part of this disc a ligamentous fasciculus hasa ascends to the inner condyle of the femur, to be inserted liga- before or behind the posterior crucial ligament. This fibro- cartilage is less closely united to the capsule than the internal, for the tendon of the popliteus muscle separates it behind from that membrane. The transverse ligament is a narrow band of fibres be- Trans- verse li- tween the semilunar cartilages at the front of the joint, gament Sometimes it is scarcely perceptible. Articular surface of the bones. — The lower end of the Articu- femur presents on each side a large convex condyle, and of the femur.752 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. a slightly hollowed part between. The articular surface on the external condyle extends highest and is the widest. Each condyloid half of the bone has the following differ- ences in its surface : altogether in front is a trochlea or pulley-like surface formed by both ; at the posterior part each is rounded and convex, but the inner one most so; whilst the intervening part of each is flattened, tibia. On the head of the tibia are two articular surfaces, but the inner one is deepest, and has the greatest extent, and pa The surfacc of the patella is divided into two parts, but unequally, by a vertical ridge, so that the outer, which cor- responds with the wider face on the externar condyle of the femur, is the largest in size.

The inferior ligament closes the space between the Jj"^}"g^^- contiguous ends of the tibia and fibula, and consists of ment. transverse yellowish fibres. It is distinct from the posterior ligament, and is fixed on one side to the end of the fibula above the pit, and on the other to the contiguous surface of the tibia, as well as to part of the posterior edge of the ar- ticular surface, so as to assist in deepening the hollow into which the astragalus is received. The interosseous liqament is an aponeurotic partition be- ^nter- ^ osseous tween the muscles on the front and the back of the lea:. Its ligament , p ^ between fibres are for the most part directed downwards from the the . . bones, outer border of the tibia to the ridge on the anterior or inner surface of the fibula; but some few cross in the opposite direction. Both superiorly and inferiorly is an aperture which transmits vessels, viz. the anterior tibial at the one spot, and the anterior peroneal at the other. Some strong irresrular bundles of fibres, which constitute the inferior in- inferior ^ liga- terosseous ligament, extend between the bones below the ment. aperture for the anterior peroneal artery; these take differ- ent directions, like the fibres of the rest of the interosseous membrane.

The tendons of the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digitorum are in contact with this ligament. External The external lateral ligament consists of three separate parts^^^^pieces, anterior, middle, and posterior: two of these (antsrior and posterior) are attached to the astragalus, and the other anterior, to the OS calcis. The anterior piece is a short flat band, which is directed from the fore part of the malleolus to the astragalus, in front of the lateral articular surface. The middle, middle portion is flattened, and descends from the tip of the malleolus to the outer surface of the os calcis, about the and pos- middle. The posterior part is the strongest, and is almost horizontal in direction ; it is connected externally to the pit on the inner surface of the malleolus, and is inserted into the posterior part of the astragalus behind the articular surface extending to the groove for the flexor proprius pollicis Connec- tcndou. The posterior and middle fasciculi are in contact with the peronei muscles.

The external calcaneo-scaphoid is placed outside the ments head of the astragalus, and serves as a lateral ligament to the astragalo-scaphbid articulation ; it is about three quarters of an inch deep, except at the centre where it is narrowed. Behind, it is fixed to the os calcis, between the articular surfaces for the cuboid bone and the astragalus; and in front it is attached to the outer side of the os scaphoides. enter As thesc ligaments enter into the articulation of the astra- into as. , tragalo- galus with thc scaplioid bone, they are lined by the same scaphoid . , , ^ o ^ articuia- synovial membrane. tion.ARTICULATIONS OF THE TARSUS. 757 d. The OS calcis with the cuboid bone.—The ligaments in Oscaiois this articulation are plantar and dorsal, the former being bold much the strongest; and there is also an internal or inter- osseous band. The dorsal ligament (superior calcaneo-cuboid) is a thin dorsal fasciculus of fibres, which is attached to the upper surfaces of the contiguous ends of the os calcis and the cuboid bone, and is divided into one or two parts. At the inner side of the OS cuboides is the rather strong internal or inter- osseous band from the os calcis : this is attached behind to the upper part of the os calcis, external to the outer band to the scaphoid bone, and in front to the contiguous inner part of the os cuboides. The inferior calcaneo-cuboid liga- and infe- ment in the sole of the foot is the strongest, and is divided gament into a superficial and a deep part:—The superficial portion (liqamentum lonqum plantce) is attached to the under surface The last ^ ^ C7 x- / , ^ isstrong- of the OS calcis from near the tuberosities to the tubercle in est, and . . divided front, and its fibres pass forwards to be connected with the into two parts„ , ridge on the under part of the cuboid bone ; whilst some of its inner fibres are prolonged over the tendon of the pe- roneus longus muscle, assisting to form its sheath, and are attached to the bases of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. The deep piece of the ligament will be seen, on division of the superficial, to extend from the tubercle and the pit in front of it on the fore part of the under surface of the OS calcis, to the portion of the cuboid bone internal to the ridge. A single synovial membrane belongs to the synovial articulation. Dissection.—The interosseous ligament uniting the astra- pissec- galus and the os calcis is now to be cut through to demon- strate the articular surfaces, the synovial sacs, and the attachment of the ligament. Articulations of the scaphoid bone.—The scaphoid union bone articulates in front with the three cuneiform bones, and scaphoid laterally with the os cuboides, by dorsal and plantar bands. a. In the articulation with the cuneiform bones there are to the cunei- three small dorsal ligaments, one to each bone, but the inner- form most is the strongest. The place of plantar bands is sup- plied by processes of the tendon of the tibialis posticus. A synovial membrane lines the articulation, and sends forwards prolongations between the cuneiform bones. 3 e 3758 DISSECTION OF THE FOOT. and the 5. In the avticulation with the os cuhoides there is a dorsal bone oblique band of fibres ; a plantar transverse band, which is concealed by the tendon of the tibialis posticus ; and a strong interosseous ligament between the contiguous surfaces of the bones. When the bones touch the surfaces are tipped with cartilage, and furnished with a prolongation from the common synovial membrane of the tarsus.

Similar plantar ligaments are wanting, except between the two innermost. There are also interosseous ligaments be- tween the contiguous surfaces of the bones. and with b. Where the external cuneiform touches the cuboid bone the cuboid the surfaces are covered with cartilage, and are furnished : with either a prolongation of the common tarsal synovial membrane, or a distinct synovial sac. A dorsal ligament i passes transversely between the two, and a plantar ligament takes a similar direction. Between the bones there is also an interosseous ligament. Synovial The Synovial membrane of the articulations of the cunei- I form bones is common to many of the bones of the tarsus. Placed between the scaphoid and the three cuneiform bones, it sends a prolongation forwards between the inner two cuneiforms to the joints of the second and third metatarsal bones; another outwards to the articulation of the scaphoid with the cuboid bone; and sometimes a third to that of the I external cuneiform with the os cuboides.

Lateral union. — The outer four bones touch one another lateral laterally, and the second lies against the internal cuneiform. At those spots they are covered with cartilage, and provided with synovial membrane, which is derived from the sacs Synovial serving for the articulation of those metatarsal with the tarsal bones. The metatarsal bone of the ^reat toe, like that of the thumb, Articu- . . . lation of is not united to the others by any intervening bands : it has great its own joint with the internal cuneiform'bone. The digital ends of all the metatarsal bones are further Anterior united by the transverse metatarsal ligament; this has been nfent. described in page 735. Articulations of the tarsal and metatarsal bones. Articu- — The last row of the tarsus articulates with the metatarsus the^tar^ in the following manner ; the three cuneiform with the inner metatar- three metatarsal, and the cuboid with the outer two meta- tarsal bones. The bones are tipped with cartilage where they -are in contact, and have, moreover, longitudinal or oblique dorsal, plantar, and lateral ligaments. a. The dorsal ligaments are thin bands of fibres, which Dorsal are either longitudinal or oblique, as they extend from the ments. ; tarsal to the metatarsal bones. Each metatarsal bone has one, except that of the second toe, to which there are three : — the first has its band from the inner cuneiform bone j the second its bands from all the cuneiform bones, one from each ; the third has a ligament from the external cuneiform ; and the fourth and fifth have a fasciculus to each from the OS cuboides. b. Longitudinal plantar ligaments; — there is one from piantar each cuneiform to its corresponding metatarsal bone, but guudln'ai between the cuboid and its metatarsal bones there are only nque": some scattered fibres. Oblique plantar ligaments between the bones are also present in the sole of the foot: for instance, a superficial fasciculus of fibres extends from the front of the internal cuneiform to the second and third metatarsal bones ; and from the external cuneiform there is a superficial band to the metatarsal bone of the little toe. c. The lateral ligaments are longitudinal; they lie deeply Longi- between the bones, and are connected with the second and interos.DISSECTION OF THE FOOT. 760 liga- third metatarsals : they will be better seen by partly cutting the transverse bands joining the bases of the metatarsals. The bone of the second toe has two, one on each side; — the inner being strong and attached to the internal cunei- form, and the outer to the middle or the outer cuneiform bone. The bone of the third toe is also provided with two lateral bands : of these the outer is fixed into the external cuneiform, and the inner into the middle cuneiform bone.* Line of Line of the articulation, — The line of the articulation ticufa- between the tarsus and metatarsus is zigzag, in consequence aS-oss of the unequal lengths of the cuneiform bones. To open the the foot.; g^pj;j^3y]^^jQj^g i\^Q i^nife should be carried obliquely forwards from the tuberosity of the fifth to the base of the second metatarsal bone ; then about two lines further back for the union of the second metatarsal with the middle cuneiform; and finally, half an inch in front of this last articulation for the joint of the internal cuneiform with the first metatarsal bone. Three The svnovial membranes in the articulation are three in synovial i . i i i mii . mem- number, as in the hand. There is one between the internal cuneiform and its metatarsal bone. A second is between the cuboid and the two outer metatarsals, and serves for the adjacenflateral articular surfaces of these bones: this is not always separate from the following. The third is placed in the articulation between the middle and the e:xternal cuneiform with their corresponding (second and third) metatarsal bones, and is an offset of the common synovial membrane belonging to the articulation of the scaphoid with the cuneiform bones (p. 758.) : prolongations from it are furnished to the lateral articular parts of the second, third, and fourth (inner side) metatarsals. Separate Dissection, — All the superficial ligaments having been for inter- taken away, the cuneiform bones may be forcibly separated o^seousj ^^^^ another and from the os cuboides ; the latter bone from the os scaphoides ; and the bases of the metatarsal bones from one another — to see the interosseous ligaments * Three of these hgamentous bands are most commonly present, viz. two to the second toe, and one to the outer side of the third toe : the ligaments inserted into the contiguous surfaces of the middle and ex- ternal cuneiform bones, may be wanting.761 ARTICULATIONS OF THE PHALANGES. between them : the dissector will find the bones tear some- times sooner than the ligaments. AkTICULATION of the metatarsus with the PHA- Union LANGES. — These are ball and socket joints, in which the tarsus head of the metatarsal bone is received into the cup-shaped langes, cavity of the phalanx. Each articulation has two lateral and an inferior ligament, two as in the hand, and the joint is further strengthened above and in- by an expansion derived from the tendon of the short exten- liga- sor of the toes. A distinct synovial membrane exists in each. In the articulation of the great toe there are two synovial . . sac. sesamoid bones, which are connected with the inferior and lateral ligaments. All these structures are better seen in the hand, where see the hand. they are more distinct; and their anatomy is more fully described with the dissection of that part. (See page 337.) Articulations of the phalanges. — There are two union of phalangeal joints to each toe, except to the first. The same i^nges^ ligaments are found in these as in the metatarso-phalangeal before joints, viz., two lateral and an inferior. The joint between ed in the the last two phalanges is least distinct, and oftentimes the small bones are immoveably united together by bone. These ligaments receive a more particular notice with the dissec- tion of the hand (p. 338.).ARTERIES OF THE LOWER LIMB. 762 TABLE OF THE ARTERIES OF THE LOWER LIMB.

It is lodged in the sjtua- orbit, and is supported in this hollow on a mass of fat; it is of the -,-.11 1 . 1 . . . 1 eyeball. surrounded by muscles which impart to it its several move- ments. Two lids or shields protect the eyeball from external P^^ts ^ around injury, and moderate the quantity of light admitted into the fjljjjjj"^ interior; and the anterior or exposed surface is covered by a mucous membrane (conjunctiva). Directions. — In the absence of specimens of the human The dis- section eye, the structure must be learnt on the eye of some lareje to be animal, as the ox for example. Let the student, therefore, ^^^^^^y^ procure half a dozen or more eyes of the ox for the purpose ox. of dissection. One or two small basins will be needed, and in the bottom of one of them, or of a deep plate, some melted wax or tallow should be run. Dissection, — To see the general form of the ball of the Detach n n 1 1 1 muS- eye, and the outer surface oi the external coat, the attach- cies. ment of the different muscles should be taken away, and the loose mucous membrane should be removed from around the anterior part. The ball of the eye is roundish in form, and consists of Form of ^ . ^ -..nn 1 . . the ball. two parts which diner greatly in appearance, viz. an opaque or posterior, forming four fifths of the whole, and a smaller transparent portion (cornea) in front; these two parts are segments of different-sized spheres, and the anterior portion belongs to the smaller sphere. To the back of the globe position the optic nerve is attached, rather to the inner side of the nerve! axis of the ball; and around it the nutritive vessels and the nerves are disposed. The antero-posterior diameter of the Diame- ball amounts to about an inch, and exceeds the transverse by about a line. The organ of vision is composed of certain parts essential ^^^^^^^^ to sight, and of others requisite for their protection and support. Its sentient constituent is a delicate expansion of of theDISSECTION OF THE EYE. 766 organ of the optic nervG (retina). Within the nervous expansion are central transparent parts to bring the rajs of light to a focus on it; and in front of these is a moveable curtain (iris) to regulate the perfection of the image in the interior. To de- fend such delicate structures, certain denser strata or coats are arranged around them; and to absorb the superabundant rays of light entering the eyeball, one of them is provided v^nth dark pigment. Number The coats of the eyeball, forminoj three strata, are arranged ofcoats J ^ o ^ > ^ & one within another, and are named sclerotic, choroid, and and cen. (.retina. The transparent media in the interior are likewise parts, three, viz. the lens, the aqueous humour, and the vitreous body. Dissec- Dissection,—To obtain a general idea of the structures to be dissected, the student may destroy one eyeball for that purpose by cutting through it circularly: he will then be able to recognise generally the arrangement of the parts mentioned above, and their strength and appearance; and will be better able to follow the directions that are after- wards given. Fibrous Fibrous coat of the eyeball.—The outer casing: of the eye consists of an opaque hinder part called sclerotic, ani of an anterior transparent part or cornea. Sclerotic The SCLEROTIC COAT (comca opaca) is the firm, whitish, and opaque part of the external stratum of the eyeball, which supports the more delicate structures within. Dissec. Dissection. — To examine the inner and outer surfaces of see the this coat^ and of the cornea, it will be necessary to cut cir- cularly through the sclerotic or outer coat, with a blunt- pointed scissors, a quarter of an inch from the cornea; and then to separate the cornea from the front of the eyeball, by breaking through a structure that fixes it slightly; in rais- ing the cornea, the student may observe the aqueous fluid escape from the containing chamber. The other structures may be then removed from the interior of the sclerotic covering; and the central parts of the ball may be set aside for subsequent use. Form The sclerotic tunic of the eye is bell-shaped, and extends tent.^^" from the entrance of the optic nerve to the margin of the Aper- cornea, forming about five sixths of the ball. At its poste- beWnd, rior part and a little to the inner side of the centre (one767 CORNEA. tenth of an inch), the optic nerve is transmitted through an aperture in it: this opening decreases in size from without inwards, and is cribriform when the nerve is drawn out — the lattice-like condition being due to the union with its margin of the bundles of fibrous tissue between the funiculi of the nerve. Other smaller apertures for the passage of the nutritive vessels and nerves are situate around that for the optic nerve. In front is the large rounded hole into and in ^ . . ^ front. which the cornea is received: it measures about half an inch transversely, and rather less from above down. On Outer ' ' 1 1 , and the outer surface this coat is smooth, except where the inner muscles are attached ; but on the inner aspect it is covered with flocculi, and with the ends of ruptured vessels and nerves, and is of a dark colour. The sclerotic covering is thickest at the back of the eyeball, but it becomes thinner xhick- and whiter towards the cornea, where it is visible as the " white of the eye ; " where it joins the cornea it becomes again somewhat thickened. Structure. — The sclerotic coat is formed of layers of Formed 1 . 1 n of white white fibrous tissue, mixed with yellow or elastic fibres, and yei- . low together with ramified anastomosing stellate or spindle- fibrous shaped cells with nuclei. Though interlaced with one with ^' another, the fibres have rather a longitudinal direction to- cells, wards the back of the ball, and a transverse one at the outer surface near the cornea. Only a few vessels ramify vessels in the membrane. The existence of nerves in it is doubtful, nerves Cornea. — This firm transparent membrane (cornea pel- Cornea": lucida) fits into the front of the eyeball, of which it forms about one sixth. Its shape is circular, though, when viewed extent in front, particularly in the ox, it appears largest in the form, transverse direction in consequence of the opaque sclerotic structure reaching further on it above and below than on the sides. It is smooth and soft to the touch, is convex ante- Curve, riorly, but concave posteriorly, and is of equal thickness throughout. Its anterior is of rather less extent than its surface, posterior surface. At the circumference it is blended with the sclerotic coat by continuity of tissue. This clear and diaphanous structure, resembling in appear- situation ance the glass of a watch, bounds the anterior chamber of of the" the eyeball, and gives passage to the rays of light entering the organ. When the cornea is supported by the aqueous its ac-768 DISSECTION OF THE EYE. tion on humour, it deflects the rays of liffht transmitted to the eye, the rays t i > n i ofiight. and thus influences by its greater or smaller convexity the different degrees of sight at a distance. After death it be- comes flaccid from the transudation of the aqueous humour; or if it is immersed in water it is rendered opaque by infil- tration of the tissue by that fluid.

It is constructed layers, of a spccial, thick part called cornea proper: in front of this is a thin elastic layer with an epithelial stratum; and be- hind it is another fine elastic membrane covered by an epi- thelium. The two structures in front of the proper cornea constitute the conjunctiva: and the two behind, the mem- brane of Demours. Cornea The comca proper (lamellated cornea) is made up of a proper is, ii i . formed scrics of supcrposcd layers, about sixty in number in a ' section at a given spot, which join one another at numerous with in- points, and cannot therefore be detached for any distance.* betvTeen.

Layer The membrane at the back of the cornea — membrane of Demours — consists of a basement layer (posterior elastic lamina. Bowman) covered by epithelium. Poste- The posterior elastic layer may be peeled off* after a cut elastic has bccu made across the cornea. It is a thin, but dense and hard membrane, -g-^^^^th to inoh. in thick- ness, which tears readily when an attempt is made to detach it, and curls up with the attached surface innermost when behind nor elas1 layer: * The facts stated in this, and in many other places in the description, are obtained from Mr. Bowman's Lectures on the Eye, and from the Physiological Anatomy, part third, 1847, of Dr. Todd and Mr. Bowman.769 CHOROID COAT. it is separated"; it is always transparent, and remains so J^^^g';^^- after boiling, after the action of acids, and even after mace- ration. At the edge of the cornea this lamina breaks up into processes ("pillars of the iris,") which turn backwards, attach- and become blended with the outer margin of the iris, and margin; with the choroid and sclerotic coats. Though very elastic, this membrane is apparently without a definite structure. A laminar epithelium, like that on serous membranes, clothes has an on epithe. its free surface. lium. The conjunctiva in front of the cornea has also a base- Layer ment layer (anterior elastic lamina, Bowman), with an epi- ofcor- thelial covering in front.

From its posterior surface fine shreds are continued into the cornea proper.

Vascular Coat of the Eyeball. — The next covering choroid is within the sclerotic, and is formed chiefly of bloodvessels vascular, and pigment cells ; its strength is but slight, and its interior ^g^P°" is lined by a pigmentary membrane. It may be divided into three parts; a posterior (choroid) corresponding with the sclerotic; an anterior (iris) opposite the cornea; and an in- termediate ring (ciliary ligament and muscle) on a level with the union of the sclerotic and cornea. Dissection. — Supposing only the sclerotic coat of an eye oissec- cut through near the anterior part, as before directed (p. 766.), see the it will be necessary, in order that the choroid coat may be coat, laid bare, to take away the rest of the sclerotic. The outer coat is to be removed in water, and two or more incisions are to be directed backwards in it, on the sides of the ball, to the optic nerve. In removing the flaps some slight con- nections are to be broken through, but the slender vessels and nerves are to be preserved. The white ring around the eye in front, which comes into view during the dissection, is the ciliary muscle which limits the extent forwards of the black choroid coat. For the purpose of seeing the anterior termination of the To see 3 DDISSECTION OF THE EYE. 770 the ci- choroid coat in the ciliary processes, let another eyeball be prol taken on which the sclerotic covering has been divided, and cesses cornea removed as before ; and after making two or three cuts in the sclerotic towards the optic nerve, the resulting flaps should be pinned to the wax in the plate, so as to sup- port the eye in an upright position. Let another eye be by an prepared in the same manner. On the one ball, in which the anterior .. ^, .ii.i i anterior view or the processes is to be obtained, proceed to remove with care the iris, tearing it away from both the white ring of the ciliary muscle and ligament, and the ciliary processes beneath, so as to leave these undisturbed and dis- and a played. On the other ball a posterior view of the processes posterior prepared: in this dissection the iris is to be left un- touched, but the choroid coat is to be divided around with a scissors, a little behind the ring of the ciliary muscle, and to be taken away with that ligament, the attached iris, and the ciliary processes behind — all in one piece. By gently washing the back of the iris the small processes will be To see made manifest. By means of the last dissection, the inte- terior," rior of the choroid coat may be seen. The structure of the st"ruc-^ membrane may be examined on a fragment obtained from the eye that was destroyed in making the preparation of the sclerotic coat. To make If a vertical section is made of another eyeball, it will section.^ show the ciliary processes in their natural position, and will demonstrate the relative situation of all the parts. This sec- tion, which it is difficult to make, should be attempted in water with a sharp, large knife, and on a surface of wax or wood: after the eye has been divided, the halves should re- main in water. Form The CHOROID COAT is a thin membrane of a dark colour, and ex- tent, and forms a segment of a sphere ; like the sclerotic stratum, it extends from the optic nerve to the fore part of the eye- ball. When viewed on the eye in which the ciliary ligament Anterior is entire, it appears to end at the ligament; but it may be tion. seen in the other dissections to bend inwards behind that ring and the iris, and to end in a series of folds or processes (pars plicata), around an anterior opening for the admission of the rays of light. This covering is thicker and stronger behind than in front: it is supported at the bottom of the eyeball by its close connection to the sclerotic coat, and inSTRUCTURE OF THE CHOROID COAT. 3 D 2 front, by the ciliary ligament. Posteriorly it is pierced by Open, a round aperture for the passage of the optic nerve ; and anteriorly is the large opening within the ring of folds called ciliary processes. The outer surface is flocculent, and is Outer! , surface covered by the remnants of a pigmentary areolar tissue rough; (membrana fusca) between it and the sclerotic coat; on it may be seen small veins arranged in parallel arches as they open into larger trunks, and lying on its surface are the ciliary vessels and nerves. The inner surface is smooth, inner I. • •1T11 / 1 smooth. and IS lined by a thin pigmentary epithelial layer (membrana pigmenti), though in the eye of the ox it shines through that layer with a metallic lustre. The ciliary processes^ or the folds or plaits by which the ciUary choroidal coat terminates in front, are arranged around the cesses, lens, like the many petals of a flower, forming a circle (cor- I'^sition. pus ciliare). These processes, about 85 in number, lie side by side, and consist of larger and smaller folds, but the Two differently sized folds do not regularly alternate; at their inner extremities they are united by loops or transverse ridges. The folds are thin externally at the commencement, and but increase in deptli internally, becoming hemispherical in form, and project inwards around the lens. By their free ends they bound circumferentially the space (posterior cham- ber) behind the iris. Behind, the ciliary processes are Connec- . tions closely connected with the membrane (suspensory ligament) with on the front of the vitreous humour, and fit into hollows be- around, tween folds on the anterior aspect of that membrane. In front they correspond with the back of the iris, but are separated from it by pigment.

Ramified ture. pigment cells make up the rest of the coat. In the outer layer the larger branches of both arteries and a plexus • 1 T 1 .

J^j.*^^^ In the interspaces of the vessels towards the outer surface "^^^^^^ there are ramified irregular pigment cells, which contain a pigment nucleus and molecular grains of dark brown colouring exter- matter. The offsets of these unite together, and form the fibrous web of this tunic, but towards the inner surface,DISSECTION OF THE EYE. where the vessels form a close plexus, the pigment cells are wanting in it. In the inner layer the vessels form a net- but very work of capillaries with meshes smaller than elsewhere, ternaiiy. whosc intersticcs are rather less towards the back than the front of the eyeball: this part of the choroidal coat is some- times described as a separate layer {tunica Ruyschiand), struc- In the ciliary processes there is also a texture of ramified ciliary^ bloodvessels though with larger capillary meshes ; and the cesses, intermixed pigment cells lose their colouring matter to- wards the tips of the folds.

It has this constitution as far forwards as the ciliary processes, but in front of that line it is several layers deep, and the cells are rounded. In the eye occa- of the ox the colouring matter is absent from the cells in the pigment bottom of the eye, and allows some fibrous tissue of the cho- roid {tapeturri) to shine through it; and in the albino the pigment is altogether deficient in the cells, so that the vessels give a red appearance to the interior of the eye. This dark layer absorbs the superabundant rays of light entering the eyeball. Ciliary CiLiART LiGAMENT AND MusCLE.—In the cve from wliich liga- . ment. the sclcrotic coat has been removed, the white band of the ciliary ligament (annulus alhidus\ with the muscle close behind it, may be seen in its natural position outside the part of the choroid coat that is reflected inwards to form the ciliary processes, situa- Ciliary ligament, — This narrow circle (about 4-o^th of an inch thick) is situate in the ball of the eye nearly opposite the junction of the cornea with the sclerotic tunic, and serves the purpose of uniting the other coats at the fore part connec- of the cyc.

It is con- Attach- nected in front with the sclerotic coat, and the radiating fibres of the posterior elastic layer of the cornea ; its fibres are directed backwards and inwards, and end on the choroid coat. The nerves to the iris pierce its fibres. The IRIS is a vascular and muscular structure, whose ins is vessels are continuous with those of the choroidal tissue. Its and position and connections may be observed in the difierent lar. dissections that have been prepared. It is suspended vertically in front of the opening in the situa- anterior part of the choroid coat, which it partly closes, and ' is pierced by an aperture for the transmission of the rays of light. It is circular in form, is variously coloured in different form, persons, and is immersed in the aqueous humour. By its circumference the iris is connected with the pos- Atta h- terior elastic layer of the cornea and the ciliary ligament, and by means of the last body with the sclerotic coat close to the cornea. The aperture in it is named the pupil of the situa- eye; this is slightly internal to the centre, and is nearly Iize of ^ circular in form, but its size is constantly varying (from -2^^^ t^ai to ^rd of an inch) by the contraction and relaxation of the ture" muscular fibres, according to the degree of light acting on the optic nerve. The anterior surface is free in the aqueous Anterior 1 • 1 T 1 T • surface; humour, and is marked by lines converging towards the pupil. The posterior surface is also free, and is covered poste- with a thick layer of pigment, to which the the name uvea has been applied. Structure,—The stroma of the iris is composed chiefly of compo. fibres of connective tissue, arranged in bundles, which are Ttruc- directed like rays towards the pupil. In it are involuntary muscular fibres, both circular and radiating, together with pigment cells. Vessels and nerves ramify through the tissue. Muscular fibres.— The sphincter of the pupil is a narrow muscu- band about g^th of an inch wide, which is close to the pupil on fibres the posterior aspect. The dilator of the pupil is said to begin ter^'"^' at the outer border of the iris, and its fibres, collected into bundles, join internally the sphincter. Enlargement of the p"p^^^ pupil is supposed to be effected by shortening of the radiat- how ing fibres, and diminution, by contraction of the circular ^^^^ ring. The movements of the iris regulate the quantity of light admitted into the eye.DISSECTION OF THE EYE. "Ibrm of pigment' ■ cells. Pig- ment colour. and looped. Nerves of the iris. Mem. brane of igment cells are spread out in the stroma, as well as !ed on both surfaces. In the substance of the iris they ramified and irregular cells as in the choroid; on the fore part they are ovalish or rounded, but still ramified; and behind, where there is a thick layer (uvea), the cells are rounded and filled with granules. The colour of the iris is dependent upon the colour and position of the pigment. The arteries of the iris have a looped arrangement: they Arteries are derived chiefly from the lonff and the anterior ciliary are ra- j ^ j dialing branches, but some come from the vessels of the ciliary pro- cesses. On arriving at the ciliary muscle the former form a circle around the margin of the iris ; from this loop other anastomotic branches are directed towards the pupil, near which they terminate in a second arterial circle, and end in small veins. The nerves of the iris divide into branches, which com- municate and extend towards the pupil; they are without dark outline, and their ending is not known. Membrane of the pupil.—In the fetus before the seventh thepupii month the aperture of the pupil is closed by a vascular fetus; transparent membrane. This structure is attached to the situa- \ tion; anterior surface of the iris, over the situation of the inner vascular circle, and divides into two distinct chambers the space in which the iris is suspended. Vessels shoot into it from the circle before referred to, and communicate across the middle line ; but at about the eighth month the vessels become impervious, and at the time of birth only fragments of the membrane remain. Ciliary Vessels and Nerves.— The ciliary arteries are ofiTsets of the ophthalmic (p. 49.), and supply the choroid coat, the ciliary processes, and the iris: they are classed into posterior and anterior, and two of the first set are named long ciliary, but they will not be seen without a special in- jection of the vessels of the eye. The posterior (short) ciliary branches pierce the sclerotic coat around and close to the optic nerve, and run on the surface of the choroid membrane till they enter its substance. Two of this set (long ciliary) are directed forward to the ciliary ligament, one on each side of the eyeball, and form a circle around the iris in the ciliary muscle, as before ex- plained, before being distributed in it; in the eye the outer time of disap- pear- ance. Arteries of the eyeball are posterior at the back J two of them named long ciliary.775 CILIARY VESSELS AND NERVES. 3 D 4 one lies rather above, and the inner rather below the level of the middle of the ball. The anterior ciliary arteries are smaller than the pos- Anterior terior, and arise at the front of the orbit, chiefly from at the muscular branches; they pierce the sclerotic coat about a line behind the cornea, and join the arterial circle of the long ciliary vessels before they end in the iris. In inflam- mation of the iris these vessels are enlarged, and form a ring around the cornea. The veins leaving the choroid coat are commonly four in Veins number, and the branches entering these trunks form arches vasa (vasa vorticosa) on the surface : they perforate the sclerotic cosa, end layer at separate points, midway between the cornea and the ophthai- optic nerve, and end in the ophthalmic vein. The ciliary nerves are derived from the lenticular gang- ciUary lion, and from the nasal nerve (p. 49.). Entering the back "^^^"^^^ of the eyeball with the arteries, they are continued forwards with the vessels between the sclerotic and choroid coats nearly as far as the ciliary muscle: at this spot the nerves send end in offsets to the cornea and then pierce the fibres of the ciliary ciliary muscle, and enter the iris, but their manner of ending is unknown. Offsets from the nerves supply the ciliary muscle. Chamber of the Aqueous Humour. — The space be- space tween the cornea in front and the lens behind, in which the aqSlous iris is suspended, contains a clear fluid named the aqueous ^^^^^^^'^^ humour. In the fetus this interval is separated into two distinct parts by the iris and the pupillary membrane, but in the adult it is only partly divided, for the two commu- is partly nicate through the pupil.

A small quantity of chloride ofDISSECTION OF THE EYE. 776 sodium, with some extractive matter, is in solution in it. It has been supposed that this fluid was secreted by a special membrane lining the cavity, but evidence of the existence of such a structure is wanting. Retina The Nervous Tunic OR Eetina. — This coat (tunica is form- , . i , . i • i ed by nervca) is continuous with the optic nerve, and is the most nerve, delicate of all the structures of the eyeball. On it the image of objects is produced by the rays of light being brought to a focus in the bottom of the eye.

To bring it into view on the eyeball on which the choroid coat was dissected, the choroidal covering must be torn away carefully with two pair of forceps whilst the eye is immersed in water or spirit. If an entire eye is used for the purpose, a thread may be passed through the cornea, and fastened to a pin fixed in wax ; then on remov- ing in a fluid the sclerotic and choroid coats, the retina will be laid bare. The interior of the retina may be seen in the eye from which the cornea, the iris, and the corpus ciliare have been removed in front, situa- The retina is the most internal of the three concentric eyeball; Strata in the globe of the eye, and is situate between the choroid coat and the transparent mass (vitreous humour) that is lodged in the interior. It is moulded upon, and supported form by the vitreous body ; and its form is that of a segment of a sphere, as in the other coats, but its aperture in front is rather larger. Beginning behind at the optic nerve, this thin tent^^" layer extends forwards nearly as far as the ciliary ligament, viz. to the spot at which the choroid coat becomes folded (outer margin of the corpus ciliare), where it ends in a wavy Cells border—the ora serrata.

Colour; This ucrvous expansion is of a pinkish gray colour, and semitransparent when fresh, so that an image can be seen on it at the bottom of the eye when the two external coats are transpa- removed ; but it soon loses this translucency, and is moreover Ind^^ rendered opaque by the action of water and other substances, nes?" Its thickness is greater at the posterior than at the anterior part of the eyeball.STRUCTURE OF THE RETD^A. 777 On the outer surface are some fine shreds, fragments of a Outer structure (Jacob's membrane) to be noticed presently, which isfloccu- float in the fluid in which the preparation may be placed ; and in a fresh eye, on which the coats have been removed from behind, a continuous layer of this membrane may be detached with care. On looking to the inside through the On the . inner vitreous body, the surface will be found covered with folds, surface but these are accidental, in consequence of the membrane having lost its proper support; and at the spot where the optic nerve expands (porus opticus) is the central artery of ^'^^'^^^^ the retina. In the interior of the human eye, in the axis of the ball, and -^^th of an inch outside the entrance of the optic nerve, is a slightly elliptical yellow point xV^^ inch in diameter, which is named the yellow spot (limbus limbus luteus of Sommerring). In the centre of that spot is a * minute hollow, the fovea centralis, which appears black in fovea consequence of the thinnesss of the wall allowing the dark traiis. \ pigment outside to be seen. Structure. — In the retina are three layers or strata of Layers different materials, together with bloodvessels: viz., an ietinl. inner, composed of nerve elements; an outer (Jacob's mem- brane), formed of peculiar bodies ; and an intermediate or granular layer. Passing vertically through the retina are other fine threads — fibres of Miiller. a. The layer of nerve substance is made up of the same One of ; elements as the gray matter of the encephalon, viz. of a sub- molecular matrix containing different-sized nerve cells, with nerve fibres instead of nerve tubes; these constituents have the following arrangement:—The tubules of the optic nerve, has two having become solid in texture, and gray in colour from the absence of the white substance of Schwann, radiate from the an inner end of the optic trunk, and communicate together to con- ed nerve struct a thin stratum at the inner aspect of the nervous layer; this delicate lamina diminishes in strength as it is followed forwards. Outside the nerve fibres is a stratum of and an the molecular material with large pale roundish nucleated granules and stellate nerve cells: this begins around the entrance of nerve the optic nerve, and becomes thinner, like the fibrous layer, as it extends forwards. In the nervous layer is a plexus of bloodvessels, which is Biood- derived from the central vessels of the retina contained in the in this layer.DISSECTION OF THE EYE. 778 optic nerve (p. 49.). When the nerve becomes membrani- form the artery divides into four or five branches; these pierce the stratum of fibres, and end in a network of capil- laries amongst the nerve cells outside them, like the vessels in the gray substance of the encephalon, and without form- ing a separate layer. In animals a marginal vessel runs circularly round the ball at the anterior termination (ora serrata) of the retina. The larger branches of the artery keep clear of the axis of the eyeball, and only capillaries occupy the yellow spot. In the fetus a branch of the artery is distributed to the back of the lens. Outer b. The outer stratum or columnar layer of the retina special (Jacob's membrane) consists of two different elements — v^^^^-i Yodi^ and cones, which are arranged in a single stratum, and with their ends directed inwards and outwards. Rods. The rods are elongated solid particles, which are pointed at the inner end, and are the more numerous of the two Cones, kinds of bodies. The cones are shaped like a flask with a long neck, and have the larger end turned inwards : they do not project so far out as the rods. When viewed on the outer surface, the cones form larger isolated swellings amongst the ends of the rods, and at a deeper level. By their inner ends both bodies are joined to the fibres of Miiller. charac- In the frosh state both are clear and homogeneous, with a glistening appearance, but these characters are soon de- stroyed by water and other fluids.

Vitreous Body. — A transparent mass fills the greater J'^it^eous part of the space within the coats of the eyeball, which has been named vitreous body from its resemblance to glass ; it consists of a clear aqueous fluid, contained in a translucent membrane, and has the consistence of jelly. Dissection,—The vitreous body may be seen on the eye Toob- on which the retina was dissected, by taking away the retina, view the ciliary ligament and processes, and the iris. To obtain a view of its anterior part with the lens in situation, an eye- ball should be pinned upright on wax; the sclerotic and choroid coats should be cut through about a quarter of an inch behind the cornea (p. 766.); and on removing carefully the cornea, the ciliary ligament, and the ciliary processes, the vitreous body will become apparent. The vitreous body is globular in form, and fills four Part of fifths of the ball of the eye, reaching forwards nearly to the giobe iris. In front the vitreous body is slightly hollowed, and u"^^ receives the lens with its capsule, to which it is closely united.

This membrane and the vitreous mass are extra-vascular, and receive their nutritive material from the vessels of the ciliary processes and retina. Suspen- Suspensory ligament of the lens (Retzius). — This is the gament, transparent membranous structure, situate around the lens extent,; at the front of the hyaloid membrane, which intervenes be- tween the anterior termination (ora serrata) of the retina and the lens capsule.

In this membrane are stiff longitudinal and elastic fibres. Canal of Canal of Petit. — Around the margin of the lens is a small canal, about one tenth of an inch across, which has situa- received the above name. It is situate between the plaited ' part of the suspensory ligament and the front of the hyaloid membrane — being the interval of separation between the anterior two. When the canal has been opened and distended with part sac- ... cuiated. air, it is sacculated at regular intervals, like the large intes- tine, in consequence of the inflation of the plaits of the an- terior boundary. The margin of the capsule of the lens projects into the space. Lens of Crystalline lens and its capsule. — The crystalline bau.^^^' lens is situate behind the pupil of the eye, and acts in bring- ing to a focus on the retina the rays of light passing through that aperture.

In the adult human eye the capsule of the lens is not ^^^f^^^^ supplied with bloodvessels; but in the fetus a branch of the central artery of the retina passes through the vitreous body to supply it on the posterior aspect.

Its measurement from side to side is from one third to half ^.i"*^"- sions ; an inch, and from before back about one fourth of an inch. On each surface are three lines diverging from the centre, lines on . ^ ^ 'the sur- and reaching towards the margin ; they are the edges of faces, planes or septa, and are so situate that those on one side are intermediate in position to those on the other. In the human eye they are not distinctly seen, because they bifur- cate repeatedly as they extend outwards. Covering the surface of the lens, and connecting it with a layer the capsule, is a layer of very transparent nucleated cells, joins it which can be recognised only in a fresh eye. After a little capsule, time these cells absorb moisture from the aqueous humour, and breaking down form the fluid that has been called aqua 3Iorgagni; but naturally there is not any fluid between the lens and its capsule.

The organ of hearing is made up of many complex parts, pefini- whicli are lodged in, or are attached to the surface of the temporal bone. The sentient structure in this or^an, as in the eyeball, is outune , . . ofthe an expansion of a special nerve over a membrane containing elements fluid. For protection this structure is enclosed in bone, organ of T« • IT 1*1 n hearing. It is surrounded by certain accessory bodies v^hich collect, and convey to it the undulations of sound. The several parts constituting the auditory apparatus may Ar- be arranged into those outside, and those v^ithin the sub- ment p , , , into two Stance oi the temporal bone. sets. A. The external set (outer ear), which may be first ex- Outer amined, include the pinna or auricle, and the auditory canal: the former has been noticed at page 37., and the latter is de- scribed below. The AUDITORY CANAL (jneatus cluditorius extevnus^ is the Audi- passage which leads from the pinna to a cavity in the tem- canal, poral bone named the tympanum, and transmits inwards sounds. Dissection, — To obtain a view of this canal, a recent tem- How to poral bone is to be taken, to which the cartilaginous pinna view of remains attached. After the soft parts are removed, the squamous part of the bone in front of the Glasserian fissure is to be sawn off; and the fore part of the meatus, except the portion below that gives support to the thin membrana tympani, is to be cut away with a bone forceps. This canal is about one inch and a quarter in length, and Length; is formed partly by bone, and partly by cartilage and mem- brane. It is directed forwards somewhat obliquely ; and is direc- sometimes bent downwards rather beyond the middle, so ' that the floor slopes from that spot both outwards and in- wards. In shape it is rather flattened from before back- size and shape.DISSECTION OF THE EAR. 784 wards ; and it is narrowest at the bent part. The outer extremity is continuous with a hollow (concha) of the ex- ternal ear, and the inner is closed by the membrana tympani. Cartiia- a. The cartilaginous is the largest part: it is about half |an"^ an inch in length, and is formed by that portion of the pinna of the outer ear which is attached to the margin of the meatus; but at the upper and posterior aspect the cartilage is defi- is deficient, and the tube is closed by fibrous tissue. Two above, or three fissures (fissures of Santorini) are found in the piece of cartilage. Osseous b. The osseous part is about three quarters of an inch long ^^^^ in the adult, and is rather constricted about the middle, near outer which it may be bent as before said. Its outer extremity is dilated, and the posterior projects further than the anterior wall; the greater part of the margin is rough, and gives inner attachment to the cartilage of the pinna. The inner end is less dilated, and is marked, except at the upper part, by a groove in the dry bone for the insertion of the membrane of the tympanum ; it is so sloped that the anterior wall juts beyond the posterior by about two lines. Condi- In the fetus the osseous part is absent. After birth it the grows out of the osseous ring (tympanic bone) which sup- ports the membrana tympani, and joins the rest of the tem- poral bone. Lining Lining of the meatus,—A prolongation of the integument brane is lines the auditory passage, and is continued over the mem- fro'ST the brane of the tympanum in the form of a thin pellicle. Around the entrance of the meatus are some fine hairs. In the subcutaneous tissue of the cartilaginous part of the Cerumi- meatus are some ceruminous glands, resembling in form and glands, arrangement the sweat glands of the skin, which secrete the ear wax, and open on the surface by separate orifices ; these are most abundant in that portion of the tube which is formed by fibrous tissue. Vessels. Vessels and nerves. — The meatus receives its arteries from the posterior auricular, the internal maxillary, and the Nerves, temporal branches of the external carotid trunk. Tts nerves are derived from the auriculo-temporal branch of the fifth nerve, and enter the auditory passage between the bone and the cartilage (p. 96.) Internal B. The internal constituents of the auditory apparatus are set of the/ TYMPANIC CAVITY. ' 785 enclosed within the temporal bone, and consist of two large ^^^^^^^ spaces, named tympanum and labyrinth, with their accessory parts. The TYMPANUM, or drum of the ear, is a hollow interposed Tympa. between the meatus auditorius and the deeper labyrmthic cavity. It communicates with the pharynx by a tube (Eus- tachian), through which the mucous membrane and the air have access to it; and it is traversed by a chain of small bones, with special muscles and ligaments connected with the ossicles. Numerous and minute vessels and nerves are in the space. Dissection. — The tympanic cavity is to be opened in both a dried and a recent bone. On the dry temporal boMe, after removing most of the ^^.^^^^^ squamous portion by means of a vertical cut of the saw dry through the root of the zygoma, and the Glasserian fissure, the tympanum will be brought into view by cutting away with the bone forceps the anterior part of the meatus audi- torius, and the projecting bone above that forms the roof of the cavity. In the recent bone, in addition to the preparation already and in made of the meatus auditorius, only the roof of the tympa- cent num should be taken away as far as may be necessary, and without doing injury to the membrana tympani, the chorda tympani nerve, and the chain of bones with its muscles. Form, — The cavity of the tympanum has the form of a Form small, round, flat box, placed on the edge; the outer and inner boundaries being flattened and the circumference cir- cular. Its size is greater from point to point of the circum- dimen- ference than across the space or from without inwards ; in the former direction it is about half an inch, but in the latter not more than half that measurement. The inner boundary/ is of greater extent than the outer, inner and on it the following objects are to be noticed. About the marked centre is the large projection of the promontory^ which be- montory 1 comes pointed posteriorly, and is marked by two or three grooves, j minute grooves that lodge the nerves forming the anasto- mosis of Jacobson. Above and below the posterior or nar- rowed part of the promontory is a large aperture, and both lead into the labyrinthic spaces. The upper opening re- sembles in shape the half segment of a circle, with the con- 3 E786 DISSECTION OF THE EAR.

Between the two canals is a thin osseous lamina, bone . between. which is hollowed above and dilated at the inner end. and is named processus cochleariformis. Some parts that have been referred to above, viz. the membrana tympani, the Eustachian tube, and the secondary tympanic membrane, require a separate notice. The membrana tympani is a thin partition between the Mem- meatus auditorius and the cavity of the tympanum. It is tympani; oval in form, taking the shape of the meatus, and is attached state in 1 . .

The membrane is placed situa- very obliquely with respect to the meatus, so that it meets the floor of that space at an angle of 45 degrees, and the outer surface is directed downwards. Towards the auditory sur aces, canal the surface is concave ; but in the tympanum it is con- vex, and has attached to its upper half the handle of one of the tympanic ossicles (malleus). Structure, — This membrane is formed of three strata or it is ^ structures, an external, internal, and middle. Two of these ofacu.. are obtained from common coverings of the body: thus, the epithe* p 1 .

The middle stratum is formed of fibrous and elastic tissues, and is fixed to the groove in the bone as before said: from the centre, where it is connected with the handle of the malleus, fibres radiate towards the circum- ference ; and near the margin is a band of strong circular fibres. The Eustachian tube is the channel through which the Eusta- tympanic cavity communicates with the fauces. It is about tube has an inch and a half in length, and is directed downwards and inwards to the pharynx ; like the meatus auditorius, it is partly osseous and partly cartilaginous in texture.

For the examination of these little bones the student should be pro- vided with some separate dry specimens, besides the ossicles that are in position in the cavity. Malleus The malleus is the longest bone and is twisted and bent: it is large at one end (head) and small and pointed at the other (handle), and has besides two processes, with a nar- head, rowcd part or neck. The head or capitulum is free in the cavity, is oval in shape, and is smooth except at the back, where there is a depression for articulation with the next neck, bone. The neck is the slightly twisted part between the handle, head and the processes. The handle or manubrium decreases in size towards the tip, and is flattened from before back- wards, except at the extremity, where it is compressed from789 OSSICLES OF THE TYMPANUM. witllin outwards : to its outer margin the membrana tjmpani is connected. The processes of the bone are two in number, short long and short: — The short one springs from the root of the process, handle on the outer side, and is connected with the mem- brane of the tympanum. The long process—processus gra- cilis, is a flattened slender piece of bone, which is connected with the neck of the malleus at the anterior aspect, and ex- tends into the Grlasserian fissure : in the adult this process is joined with the surrounding bone, and cannot be separated from it. The incus is a flattened bone, and consists of a body and incus, two processes. The bod?/ is hollowed at the upper and an- its body j terior part to articulate with the malleus. The two pro- pro- cesses (long and short) extend from the side opposite to the short ' , articulation : — the shorter process is somewhat conical, and long, is received into the aperture of the mastoid cells : the long process decreases towards the extremity, where it curves and ends in a rounded and convex point, the orbicular with or- bicular process. point. The stapes has, like a stirrup, a base or wider part, and stapes; two sides or crura that are blended at the opposite end in a head. The base is formed by a thin osseous plate, which is base; convex at one margin and almost flat at the other, corre- sponding with the shape of the fenestra ovalis ; the surface that is turned to the vestibule is convex, whilst the opposite is excavated. The head is marked by a superficial depres- head; sion, which receives the orbicular process of the incus ; and below it is a constricted part, the neck of the bone. The crura extend from the base to the neck, and are grooved, crura, like the base, on the inner surface: the anterior crus is shorter and straighter than the other. Position of the ossicles. — The malleus is placed vertically position in the tympanum, with the head upwards, and the articular maiieus, surface turned backwards to be connected with the incus : its handle is attached externally to the membrana tympani; and its long process is directed forwards into the Glasserian fissure. The incus is so placed that the long process is ver- of the tical, and the short one horizontal. Externally it is united with the malleus, and its processes are thus disposed: — the short one is received into the aperture of the mastoid cells; and the long process descends, like the handle of the malleus,790 DISSECTION OF THE EAR. but rather posterior to it and nearer the inner wall of the the cavity, to join inferiorly with the stapes.

Nerves Nerves.—The lining membrane of the tympanum is sup- severai plied from the plexiform communication (tympanic plexus) established between Jacobson's and the sympathetic nerve; but the muscles derive their nerves from another source.

After the tympanum has been laid open, Jacobson's nerve is to be followed in its canal, and the branches that lie in the grooves on the surface of the promontory are to be pur- sued — one of these arching forwards and two coursing upwards. The connections of the chorda tympani nerve can be seen on the preparation used for the muscles.

The bone is to be sawn through vertically close to the inner wall of the tympanum, so as to lay bare this wall and the fenestra ovalis leading into the vestibule : in this section one of the semicircular canals (horizontal) may be laid open just above the fenestra ovalis. By enlarging the fenestra ovalis a very little in a direction upwards and forwards, the end of the superior semicircular canal and the vestibular space will appear. Other views of the cavity may be obtained by sections of other bones in different directions, according to the skill and the knowledge of the dissector.

It is doubtful whether the two two join? sacs communicate. Wall of Structure of the sacs. — The wall of the membranous the sac ^ three labyrinth is translucent and firm ; but it is more opaque strata, where the vessels and nerves enter it. Three strata enter into the construction of the membrane, together with blood- vessels and nerves. The outer covering is loose and floccu- lent, and easily detached, and contains irregular pigment cells with ramifying bloodvessels. The middle stratum is clear and tough, and appears like cartilage, or, where it is thin, like the hyaloid membrane of the eyeball (Todd and Bowman). And the inner one is formed by a layer of polygonal nucleated cells, which are easily separated from one another. otoliths The small calcareous masses, or the otoliths, consist of are ' grains of minute rouudcd and elongated grains of carbonate of lime which are situate in the inner part of the wall of the utricle and saccule. Within the enlargement of each semicircular tube a calcareous material (otolith) is contained in the cells lining it. — (Todd and Bowman.) Blood- Bloodvessels. — The membranes of the labyrinthic of the cavity receive their blood from an artery that'I enters the brane. internal auditory meatus with the nerve. The veins are united into one, and end in the superior petrosal sinus. Internal The internal auditory artery arises from the basilar trunk audi- ^ ^ *ory within the skull (p. 190.), and enters the internal meatus artery ^ . with the auditory nerve. In the bottom of that hollow it divides into two branches —- one for the vestibule, the other for the cochlea. hxl^ch ^' The branch to the vestibule, after piercing the wall of braHous' cavity, subdivides into small branches, which ramify over801 VESSELS AND NERVES. the exterior of the membranous labyrinth, and the tubes occupying the semicircular canals. The vessels end in a network of capillaries on the exterior as well as in the termina- substance of the special layer, and this is most developed about the termination of the nerves. b. The branch to the cochlea subdivides into twii^s that andan- other to enter the canals in the modiolus. Small offsets from these the cochlea. are directed outwards through holes in the lamina spiralis, and communicate together in loops near the margin of that osseous zone, but in greatest number on that surface to- Mode of wards the tympanic scala. From this anastomosis vessels tf™^"^" are supplied to the membrane lining the scalag, and to the structure called cochlearis muscle. A capillary vessel (? venous) is placed longitudinally in the membranous part of the septum scalarum, and communicates here and there with the arterial loops before mentioned. The vein. — One branch of vein is derived from the vein to cochlea, and another from the membranous labyrinth: the It^lS'.^^ two are united near the cochlea, and the trunk ends in the superior petrosal sinus in the base of the skull. Nerve of the Labyrinth. — Only one special nerve, Audi- auditory, is distributed to the labyrinth (p. 198.). Entering ne7ve the internal auditory meatus, the nerve divides into two divides branches, like the artery, viz., an anterior for the cochlea, and a posterior for the membranous labyrinth. In the trunk and in both branches there are nerve cells contained: in the nerve to the labyrinth they form a reddish swelling, which was named intumescentia ganglioformis by Scarpa. a. The cochlear branch divides at the base of the medio- a coch- lear lus into twigs that enter the apertures in that body. These branch, small divisions of the nerve are directed outwards with the vessels in the canals in the lamina spiralis, but nearest the tympanic scala, where they form a plexiform arrangement, with lengthened interspaces and ganglion cells. At the whose edge of the bone the nerve tubules cease to divide, and reach ments end in a short distance into the membranous part of the septum the sep- ^ ^ turn, scalarum, where they are arranged in conical sets parallel with one another; but their mode of ending is not satisfac- torily made out. The nerve fibres do not lose the white retain- substance of Schwann at their termination, but retain it in white the minutest tubules (Bowman), stance. 3 F802 ENDING OF AUDITORY NERVE. Professor Kolliker states that the nerves end on the vestibular surface of the membranous part of the septum, in the form of uni- polar ganglion cells, and that before they terminate they lose their dark outline. vestibu- b. The vestibular branch ends in three nerves for the lar branch membranous labyrinth : these pierce the cribriform plate in into the bottom of the meatus, and are thus distributed: — one ' appertains to the utricle, and to the enlargements on the tubes contained in the superior vertical and horizontal semi- circular canals; a second ends in the saccule; and the third belongs to the ampuUary swelling on the tube of the posterior vertical semicircular canal, theirter- Termination of the vestibular nerves. — The ending of the mina- «^ o tion. nerve fibres on the sacs and on the ampullary enlargements is different. On the On the membranous sacs the nerve divides, and its fila- sacs they ments separate ; some filaments passing through the otolith and others outside it. Those w^hich pass outside the calca- reous matter, spread out on the inner surface ; and meeting lose with the lining of nucleated cells, the tubules lose the white ^b-^ substance of Schwann, and probably end in a " fibrous stance, that of the inner stratum of the nervous layer of the retina (Todd and Bowman). The same authors state and end that the tubulcs surrouudcd by the otolith appear to termi- in fibres , , , , rr inside, natc in free points, without losing their white substance. In the In the ampullary enlargement of the tubes of the semi- arched r ^ tubes circular canals the nerve enters the concave side, where it they . . \ form a forms a forked eminence (Steifensand), corresponding with tion, and the pro]ection in the interior. The nerve tubules do not' end in ^ ^ loops spread out as in the sacs, but are confined to the swelling, in therein, . . ^ which they end in a series of loops (Wagner). Some of the nerve fibres are said to terminate in free extremities as well as in loops.INDEX.

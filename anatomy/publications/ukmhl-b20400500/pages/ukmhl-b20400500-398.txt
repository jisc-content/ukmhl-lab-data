378 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. the right with care, close above the pulmonary artery, and to be " drawn well over to the left side: next, the descending cava is to be divided above the entrance of the vena azygos, and its lower part thrown down. By the removal of some fibrous and fatty tissues and lymphatic glands, the right part of the plexus, in which the cervical cardiac branches of the sym- pathetic and pneumo-gastric nerves of the right side are united, will be seen in front of the trachea, above the right branch of the pulmonary artery. The offsets to the heart should be followed downwards on the trunk of the pulmo- nary artery ; and those to the right lung should be traced along the branch of that artery. To ex- To lay bare the part of the plexus into which the cervical pose the '' ^ , left part, brauchcs of the sympathetic and vagus nerves of the left side of the body enter, the arch may be cut through a second time, to the left of the junction of the ligamentum arteriosum with it; and that ligament is to be divided, so as to allow the transverse part of the arch to be turned upwards with the great vessels attached to it. The lymphatic glands and the connective tissue are to be cleared away from the nerves, as on the opposite side; and the nerves are to be followed downwards to the heart, chiefly to the posterior coronary plexus. Nerves In the deep cardiac plexus are united the several cardiac the^de"ep ncrvcs derived from the ganglia of the sympathetic of both plexus, sides of the neck, except the highest nerve of the left side; and in it are collected also all the cardiac branches of the vagus nerves in both the neck and chest, with the exception Its situ- of the lowest cervical cardiac branch of the left side. This large centre is situate between the trachea and the arch of the aorta, above the branches of the pulmonary artery; and from it nerves are furnished to the heart and the lungs, is form- The several nerves entering the plexus are not intermingled par°ts^^° in a ganglionic mass in front of the trachea; but those of and left, the right side unite together on the corresponding part of the air tube, and those of the left half of the neck have a like disposition on their side. Right ^- 1'^® rigM part of the plexus is above the right branch of the formed^^' piili^o^^^^T artery, and receives the nerves of the right side, viz. the cardiac nerves of the sympathetic in the neck ; the cardiac branches of the trunk of the vagus, both in the neck and chest,

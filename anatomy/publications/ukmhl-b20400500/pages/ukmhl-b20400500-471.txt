SUPERFICIAL PERINEAL VESSELS AND NERVES. 451 manner as on the left side. One long slender artery is the right superficial perinaeal, which gives a transverse branch near its commencement: sometimes there are two superficial branches. Two superficial perinaeal nerves are to be found with the artery; and the inferior pudendal is to be traced forwards to the scrotum. Communications are to be sought between these nerves anteriorly, and between one of the perinaeal and the inferior hsemorrhoidal posteriorly ; and all the nerves are to be followed back to their origin. Arteries. —The arteries beneath the fascia, viz. super- super- ficial and transverse perinaeal, are branches of the pudic, and vessels are two or three in number. ofpudic. The superficial perinceal branch is given off from the pudic artery in front of the branch to the rectum. Perforating usually the base perinscai of the triangular ligament, it turns forwards over or under the transverse muscle, and beneath the superficial fascia, to the back of the scrotum, where it ends in flexuous branches for that part. ^"^^ ' . ^ ^ ^ scrotum, As the vessel lies beneath the fascia, internal to the pubic arch, it supplies offsets to the muscles beneath: and in front, it anasto- ^"^ ^"p- ^ 7 7 plies the moses with the external or superficial pudic branches of the muscles, femoral artery.

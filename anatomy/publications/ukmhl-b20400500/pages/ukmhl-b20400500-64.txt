44 DISSECTION OF THE OKBIT. oblique muscle is recognised by the fourth nerve entering it: the levator palpebrae and superior rectus are beneath the frontal nerve; and the external rectus is partly seen below the lachrymal nerve. In the outer part of the orbit, near the front, is the lachrymal gland. Trace The frontal and lachrymal nerves should be followed for- superfi- ciai wards to their exit from the orbit, and backwards with the nerves. fourth through the sphenoidal fissure to the wall of the cavernous sinus. In tracing them back, it will be expedient to remove the projecting clinoid process, should this still remain; and some care and trouble will be necessary to follow the lachrymal nerve to its commencement.

In the Contents of the orbit,—Besides the eyeball and the lachry- eyebaii, mal gland, there is a great quantity of granular fat in the seven orbit. Conncctcd with the eye are six muscles — four ' straight and two oblique ; and there is also an elevator of several the Upper eyelid in the cavity. The nerves in this small nerves, spacc are numerous, viz. the second, third, fourth, ophthalmic of the fifth, and the sixth nerve, together with the small orbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve; and their their general distribution is as follows : — the second nerve enters hnllon; the eyeball, the third is furnished to all the muscles but two, the fourth enters the superior oblique (one of the two ex- cepted), and the sixth is spent in the external rectus muscle. The fifth nerve supplies some filaments to the eyeball, but the greater number of its branches pass through the orbital and cavity to the face. The ophthalmic vessels are likewise some . vessels.

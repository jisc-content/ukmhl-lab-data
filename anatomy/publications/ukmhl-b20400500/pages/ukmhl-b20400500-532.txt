DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 512 folds of between the liver and the wall of the abdominal cavity are the liver. named ligaments. There is a suspensory fold along the upper part, containing the obliterated umbilical vein ; and there is a coronary ligament along the posterior border. Suspen- The suspensory or falciform ligament is placed between gament. the Upper couvcx surface of the liver and the parietes of the Shape, abdomen. It is falciform in shape ; in the recumbent posi- tion of the body, it has the base turned forwards, and the Attach- apex backwards. The lower border is concave, and is at- ments. tached to the liver; whilst the opposite border is convex, and is connected to the abdominal wall on the right side of Contains the liuca alba, and to the under part of the diaphrao;m.

Its two pieces of peritoneum are widely separated from one another, and between them the kidney touches the liver. MESENTERIC VESSELS AND SYMPATHETIC NERVE. Examine Directions, â€” The vessels and nerves (mesenteric) that are seis to distributed to the alimentary tube, except to the upper and tine. the lower part, may be first dissected. After these have been examined, and the connections of the aorta and vena cava have been seen, the intestine can be taken out to give

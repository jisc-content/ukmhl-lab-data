469 CUTANEOUS VESSELS. H H 3 cutaneous nerves are branches from the intercostal arteries, and with the anterior cutaneous are offsets from the internal mammary and epigastric vessels. In the groin are three small superficial branches of the femoral artery, viz. pudic, epigastric, and circumflex iliac : these last are dissected on the right side. The lateral cutaneous arteries have the same anatomy as Both the nerves they accompany. They are directed tov^ards the front of the abdomen, and end about the outer edge of the rectus muscle. The anterior cutaneous vessels are irregular in number and an- and in position, like the nerves. After piercing the sheath cuta. ^ ^ neous. 01 the rectus, they run outwards with the nerves towards the other set of branches. Branches of the femoral artery, — Three cutaneous offsets From femoral ascend from the thigh between the layers of the superficial artery fascia, and ramify in the integuments of the genital organs, branch- and in those of the lower part of the abdomen. The greater portion of these vessels appears in the dissection of the thigh. The external pudic branch (superficial) crosses the spermatic cord, External to which it gives offisets, and ends in the integuments of the under ^^'^^^^ part of the penis. The mperficial epigastric branch ascends over Poupart's hgament, Super- near the centre, and is distributed in the superficial fascia nearly as epigas- high as the umbilicus. Its size varies very much. The circumflex iliac branch lies usually below the level of the iliac Circum. crest, and sends only a few ofisets upwards to the abdomen. Small veins accompany the arteries, and join the internal veins, saphenous vein in the thigh. The glands of the groin are three or four in number, and ingmnaf lie over the line of Poupart's ligament. They are placed be- tween the strata of the superficial fascia, and receive the lymphatics from the abdomen, from the upper and outer part of the thigh, and from the superficial parts of the genital organs. Their efferent ducts pass downwards to the saphe- Ducts nous opening in the thigh to enter the abdomen. thS- Dissection. -— After the examination of the superficial Dissec- fascia with its vessels and nerves on the abdomen, the cXr- student may make the dissection of the cutaneous coverings petiis., of the penis and scrotum.

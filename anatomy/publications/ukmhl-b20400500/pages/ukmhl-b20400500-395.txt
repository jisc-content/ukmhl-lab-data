PNEUMO-GASTRIC NERVE. 375 The right nerve is deeper at first in its position, and is Right also shorter and straighter than the left. As it enters the above chest the nerve crosses behind the subclavian vein, but in lung. front of the internal mammary artery; and it lies afterwards along the right side of the innominate vein and the superior cava till it comes in front of the root of the lung. The left nerve has the same position to vessels as the Left • • • T 1 • r> nerve risrht when entering the cavity, but it is directed m front of above ® ^ root: the arch of the aorta to the root of the lung; and, lower down, it makes a curve around the projecting heart. Before is longer reaching the arch of the aorta, the nerve is external to the right, left common carotid artery, and crosses the left vagus from without inwards, so as to be internal to that nerve on the arch. Branches. — Some small filaments are said to be furnished some from the nerve to the pleura and pericardium; and occasion- ally the nerve is joined, near the upper part, by a twig from the branch of the nerve to the subclavius muscle. Internal mammary artery. — A small part of this artery. Internal which furnishes a branch to the diaphragm, has not yet been malr" noticed. This part intervenes between the point of entrance ^^^^"^^ of the artery into the chest (p. 74.), and its course through the cavity along the side of the sternum (p. 266.). Lying winds beneath the first rib the vessel winds round the phrenic Ipe?ture nerve and the innominate vein to reach the side of the ' rax, sternum. It gives the following offset: — The superior phrenic branch (comes nervi phrenici) is a and very slender artery, that accompanies the phrenic nerve to phrenic the diaphragm, and is distributed to that muscle, anasto- mosing therein with the other arteries from the aorta, and with the musculo-phrenic branch of the internal mammary. The PNEUMO-GASTRic NERVE is One of the three trunks vagus constituting the eighth cranial nerve (p. 116.). Like the "n\he phrenic nerve, each passes through the thorax in its course cw^e?^ from the neck to the abdomen. In the lower part of the on^both thorax the nerves resemble one another in their course, for low root they pass behind the root of the lung, each on its own side, and along the oesophagus to the stomach. But above the root of the lung, the right and left nerves differ as much as the phrenic. Each supplies branches to the viscera, viz. to the heart, the lungs, and the gullet.

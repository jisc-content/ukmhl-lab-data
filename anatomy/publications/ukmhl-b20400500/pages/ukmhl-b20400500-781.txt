761 ARTICULATIONS OF THE PHALANGES. between them : the dissector will find the bones tear some- times sooner than the ligaments. AkTICULATION of the metatarsus with the PHA- Union LANGES. — These are ball and socket joints, in which the tarsus head of the metatarsal bone is received into the cup-shaped langes, cavity of the phalanx. Each articulation has two lateral and an inferior ligament, two as in the hand, and the joint is further strengthened above and in- by an expansion derived from the tendon of the short exten- liga- sor of the toes. A distinct synovial membrane exists in each. In the articulation of the great toe there are two synovial . . sac. sesamoid bones, which are connected with the inferior and lateral ligaments. All these structures are better seen in the hand, where see the hand. they are more distinct; and their anatomy is more fully described with the dissection of that part. (See page 337.) Articulations of the phalanges. — There are two union of phalangeal joints to each toe, except to the first. The same i^nges^ ligaments are found in these as in the metatarso-phalangeal before joints, viz., two lateral and an inferior. The joint between ed in the the last two phalanges is least distinct, and oftentimes the small bones are immoveably united together by bone. These ligaments receive a more particular notice with the dissec- tion of the hand (p. 338.).

Dissec- Dissection. — To examine more fully the hippocampus, the parts of the corpus callosum and fornix, that remain in the middle line, should be divided, and the posterior lobe of the left hemisphere should be drawn backwards. When the pia mater has been removed from the inner side of the hip- pocampus, and this projection has been cut across, its struc- ture will be manifest, struc- The hippocampus is covered on the ventricular surface hippo- by a medullary investment, in which the taenia, or the band campus. ^£ ^YiQ fornix ends. On the opposite aspect this body is hollowed, and contains gray matter from the surface of the brain. Along the free margin of the hippocampus the gray matter projects in the form of a notched ridge, the fascia dentata.

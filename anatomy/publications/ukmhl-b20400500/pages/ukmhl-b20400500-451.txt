431 MEMBRANES OF THE CORD. around the cord, is mucli looser than the like part on the brain. The outer ov parietal part is inseparably joined to parietal the inner surface of the dura mater, and gives to that mem- tached brane its shining appearance. The inner or visceral layer and ' surrounds the cord loosely, so as to leave a considerable ^^^^^^^^e interval between the two (subarachnoid space) : at the lower [^^^^^J part of the spinal canal this loose sheath is much the largest, sub- and envelops the mass of nerves that form the cauda equina. no\d' As the different spinal nerves extend to the intervertebral foramina they receive sheaths from the loose or visceral part of the arachnoid membrane, and retain the same till they perforate the dura mater. Dissection.—The subarachnoid space of the cord mav be Toex- pose, made evident, either by placing the handle of the scalpel ^ub-^ beneath the visceral layer, or by putting a detached piece of "^^^ , the cord in water, with the posterior aspect uppermost, and blowing air beneath the serous membrane. The subarachnoid space is situate between the loose or Sub- . arach- visceral part of the arachnoid membrane, and the spinal cord "oid , . -T- space invested by pia mater. Larger at the lower than at the upper part of the spinal canal, the space contains a special contains fluid (cerebro-spinal); and it communicates with the cavity and in the interior of the brain by the aperture in the fourth fino ca- ventricle. Crossing the space at the posterior part of the brain, cord, are bundles of fibrous tissue, especially in the neck, where these bands are collected into an imperfect partition There is or septum along the middle line. In the space likewise are perfect the serrations of the ligamentum denticulatum, and the roots behin'd. of the spinal nerves, with some vessels. Dissection. — For the purpose of seeing the next covering pissec- of the cord with the ligamentum denticulatum, the arachnoid next co- . , , vering. membrane is to be taken away. The pia mater is much less of a vascular structure on the Pia spinal cord than on the brain. Thicker and more fibrous in its nature, the membrane closely surrounds the cord; it ^^^^^ sends thin prolongations into the anterior and posterior median fissures of the cord, and furnishes offsets to the roots sj^^^s^ of the spinal nerves. The outer surface of the pia mater is Kolliker. According to the view of this anatomist, the membrane is a simple tube corresponding to the visceral layer in the text.

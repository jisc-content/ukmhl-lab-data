It is said by some, that the transverse fibres of the pons become longitudinal, and thus increase the number, from^an- a. The fibrcs of the anterior pyramid pass through the pyramid, pous bctwcen tlio two scts of transvcrso fibres, but not as one mass, for they are divided into a number of small bundles in their progress. Much increased in number, the fibres enter the crus cerebri at the upper border of the pons, and give rise to that fasciculated surface of the peduncle, which is now uppermost. * from la- h. The ascending fibres of the lateral and posterior columns posterior of the cord are altogether deeper than the commissural fibres sph!a^ of the pons, and are mixed up with gray matter ; they are ' also more numerous than the preceding set. These fibres pro- ject close to the middle line, in the floor of the fourth ven- tricle, and form the eminence of the fasciculus teres ; from that spot they are continued upwards to the crus cerebri, where they enter its deeper or cerebral part. In the pons a band from the olivary fasciculus is added to these fibres, from c. The olivary fasciculus (fillet, p. 204.) divides into two body. slips in the pons. One passes backwards to the upper (in this position deeper) part of the crus cerebri, and ends in and beneath the corpora quadrigemina (p. 229.). The other is continued to the cerebrum with the fibres of the lateral column.

Trans- The transverse fibres of the pons, opposite the septum, are very slender, and are seen only on transverse sections of a hardened pons; they come from the floor of the fourth ventricle, pierce the longitudinal fibres, and are then continued across the middle line, between the antero-posterior, as in the medulla oblongata.

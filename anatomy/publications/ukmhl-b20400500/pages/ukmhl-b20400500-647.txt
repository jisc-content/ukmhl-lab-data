STRUCTURE OF THE URETHRA. 627 s s 2 generally on the upper aspect or the roof of the urethra, opposite the fossa navicularis. The ducts of Cowper's Ducts of glands open on the mucous membrane : they are two in of'c"ow. number, and terminate, one on each side, on the floor of the urethra near the front of the bulb, but in the ordinary ex- amination they are seldom to be recognised. Mucous lining of the urethra, — The mucous membrane of Mucous the urethra is continued into the bladder, as well as into the SX": ducts opening into the canal, and joins in front the tegu- mentary covering of the glans penis. It is of a reddish colour; colour in the spongy and membranous portions, but in the prostate it becomes whiter. In the spongy and membranous parts it is thrown into longitudinal folds during the con-folds, tracted state of the penis. Its surface is studded with follicles, glands; and with the apertures of mucous glands; and is provided with papillae towards the external orifice. Its epithelial ^y^'^^' covering is of the columnar kind, but near the meatus ex-'""' ternus this becomes laminar. Submucous tissue, ^^enQ2iih the mucous lining of the submu- urethra is a stratum of longitudinal involuntary muscular tTssue; fibres mixed with elastic and fibrous tissues. It is continuous nature; behind with the submucous fibres of the bladder, and is joined in the prostate by the fibres accompanying the common seminal ducts. ^ This structure differs in quantity along the canal. It is most developed in the prostate, where it ^'enUn" forms the projection of the crest and blends with the cir- ^^^^^^^^ cular fibres of that body. In the membranous portion of the canal the muscular structure is less abundant. In the spongy part the submucous structure is richer in fibrous in elements ; and the muscular fibres end in the usual way in the submucous tissue towards the outer orifice.* In the prostatic and membranous divisions of the urethra Erectile there is, in addition, a thin enveloping layer of vascular or through- erectile tissue, which is continued backwards from the corpus spongiosum urethra to the neck of the bladder. ^ Structure of the Penis. — The form and the connec- P^ms^ tions of the penis having been described at page 600., it re- of'two'^ mains now to notice the tissues of which it is composed, erectile The section already made through the penis shows this body ^""^'^^ * For farther detail refer to the Paper before mentioned,

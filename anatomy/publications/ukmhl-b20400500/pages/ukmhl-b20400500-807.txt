EUSTACHIAN TUBE. 787 carotid canal, only a thin scale of bone intervening : in it canaia ' *' ^ ° ^ for ten- are the apertures of two canals that lie on the outer side of tym- ^ pam and the passage for the carotid artery:—the upper one contains Eusta- the tensor tympani muscle, and the lower one is the Eusta- tube, chian tube. Between the two canals is a thin osseous lamina, bone . between. which is hollowed above and dilated at the inner end. and is named processus cochleariformis. Some parts that have been referred to above, viz. the membrana tympani, the Eustachian tube, and the secondary tympanic membrane, require a separate notice. The membrana tympani is a thin partition between the Mem- meatus auditorius and the cavity of the tympanum. It is tympani; oval in form, taking the shape of the meatus, and is attached state in 1 . . P . . T P t the adult by its circumterence to a groove at the inner end oi the and the auditory passage; but in the fetus it is fitted into a separate osseous ring, the tympanic bone. The membrane is placed situa- very obliquely with respect to the meatus, so that it meets the floor of that space at an angle of 45 degrees, and the outer surface is directed downwards. Towards the auditory sur aces, canal the surface is concave ; but in the tympanum it is con- vex, and has attached to its upper half the handle of one of the tympanic ossicles (malleus). Structure, — This membrane is formed of three strata or it is ^ structures, an external, internal, and middle. Two of these ofacu.. are obtained from common coverings of the body: thus, the epithe* p 1 .

The middle stratum is formed of fibrous and elastic tissues, and is fixed to the groove in the bone as before said: from the centre, where it is connected with the handle of the malleus, fibres radiate towards the circum- ference ; and near the margin is a band of strong circular fibres. The Eustachian tube is the channel through which the Eusta- tympanic cavity communicates with the fauces. It is about tube has an inch and a half in length, and is directed downwards and inwards to the pharynx ; like the meatus auditorius, it is partly osseous and partly cartilaginous in texture. The osseous part is rather more than half an inch in length, an osse- and is narrowed at the middle. Its opening in the tympanum and its situation with respect to the canal for the tensor situa- 3 E 2

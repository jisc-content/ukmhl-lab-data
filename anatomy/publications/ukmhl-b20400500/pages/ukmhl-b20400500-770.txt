750 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. Two ^ The crucial ligaments are two strong fibrous processes, liga- which intervene between the ends of the tibia and femur, and ments. , . ^ • • i l • r^^^ cnieiiy maintain those bones in contact, ihey cross one another somewhat like the legs of the letter X, from which circumstance they have received their name. One is an- terior to the other at the attachment to the tibia. Anterior a. The anterior ligament is oblique in its direction, and is lique; Smaller than the posterior. Inferiorly it is attached to the tach- inner lip of the hollow in front of the spine of the tibia, close to the inner articular suriace; and superiorly it is inserted into the back part of the outer condyle of the femur, on the inner surface, and slightly into the interval between the con- dyles. posterior The posterior ligament is almost vertical between the u \erti- ^^j^gg back of the joint. By the lower end it is fixed to the back of the depression behind the spine of the tibia, near the margin of the bone ; and by the upper extremity it is inserted into the fore part of the hollow between the condyles of the femur, and into the contiguous surface of the inner condyle. Their The usc of thcsc ligaments in the movements of the joint, after the other ligaments have been cut through, should be studied. slight When the joint is only slightly bent, the posterior liga- fnd ex- ment is stretched: and when it is straightened again the tension. ^^^^^'^^^ band is made tense. As the ligaments act in the In ex- ^ flexion ^^^^^^ above stated in keeping one articular surface on and ex- another, both will be called into play in extreme flexion and tension. ' y J extension. For in great flexion the anterior will be stretched with the posterior, because there is an attempt to separate the articular surfaces backwards at the same time. So in great extension, the posterior comes into action after the anterior ligament, to prevent the femur being carried for- wards. In rota- In rotation inwards of the libia the lio^aments are crossed tion. ° tightly, and the movement is arrested by the anterior fasci- culus ; but in rotation outwards of that bone the ligaments untwist, becoming almost parallel, so as to allow the bone to be turned back foremost.

DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 200 Origin The filaments of origin unite into two bundles, which medulla. Separately pierce the dura mater, and do not become blended together till they are outside the cranial aperture. Deep Deep origin.—The filaments of this nerve are traced to a nucleus from" in the floor of the fourth ventricle, between the groove of the ventri*- Hiiddle line and the nuclei of the glosso-pharyngeal and vagus nerves, which corresponds with the lower part of the fasciculus teres. Section III. MEDULLA OBLONGATA AND PONS VAROLII. The medulla oblongata and the pons are interposed between the spinal cord and the brain proper. In these bodies the elements of the cord are re-arranged and increased in volume before entering the cerebrum and the cerebellum. Uon^^" Directions,— On a single brain the student may ascertain nearly all the anatomy of the parts composing the medulla and the pons ; but if he can procure one hardened specimen of the medulla and the pons united, and another of a vertical section through those same bodies, his knowledge will be much more perfect. Position Position.— The brain is to remain in the position in which pL?^ it was placed during the examination of the nerves and the vessels. Upper The MEDULLA OBLONGATA is the uppor dilated part of the sjJn^ai spinal cord which is contained in the cranium. Its limit is s?ti?a- the lower border of the pons in one direction, and the level of the upper margin of the atlas in the opposite direction, and This part of the cord is pyramidal in form, and measures about one inch and a quarter in length, half an inch in thickness, and three quarters of an inch in breadth at its widest part. Base. The larger part or the base of the medulla joins the pons, the transverse fibres of the latter marking its limit; and the Apex, apex is blended with the cord at the spot before mentioned. Surfaces. The anterior surface is irregularly convex, and is in contact with the hollowed basilar process of the occipital bone. The opposite surface is somewhat excavated superiorly, where it forms the floor of the fourth ventricle, and rests in the fissure between the halves of the cerebellum. On the poste-

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 482 one of these is to be carried througli the fibres that are attached to Poupart's ligament; the other, across the muscle from the front of the hip bone to the margin of the rectus. With a little care the muscle may be separated easily from the thin fascia beneath. Fascia The fascia transversalis is a thin fibrous layer between trans- . , versalis the transvcrsalis muscle and the peritoneum, which has been is best so named by Sir A. Cooper. In the ffroin or ino^uinal region marked , . / ^ . ^ i n - • • ^ in the whcro it IS Unsupported by muscles, the lascia is consider- "* ably stronger than elsewhere, and is joined by fibres of the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle; but above that region it gradually decreases in strength, until at the thorax it becomes an unimportant thin membrane. In the part of ^^^^ the fascia now laid bare is an opening — the internal abdo- ngament ^^^^^ which givcs passage to the spermatic cord, or internal rouud ligament, according to the sex. On the inner side abdomi- of that Opening the fascia is thinner than on the outer side, nal ring. ^ ^ ' and is fixed internally into the pubes and the pectineal line of the hip bone, behind the conjoined tendon with which Is partly it is United. When traced down to Poupart's ligament, this Pou^- ^ membrane will be found joined to the posterior margin of gament, that band along the outer half; but only slightly connected fy not^.'^*" with the ligament along the inner half, as it is directed down to the thigh in front of the bloodvessels, and forms the anterior part of a loose sheath (crural) around the vessels. Situation Abdominal ring, —The opening of the internal abdominal minai ring is situate midway between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior iliac spine, and half an inch above Poupart's ligament. From its margin a thin tubular prolongation of the fascia is continued around the cord. Dissec- Dissection, — The prolongation of the fascia tranversalis trace ou the cord may be traced by cutting the fascia horizontally on°cord. abovc the opening of the ring, and then longitudinally over j the cord.

Its depth varies much in different bodies, but the stratum is thicker at the lower part j

788 DISSECTION OF THE EAR. tympani muscle have been alluded to; its course in the tem- poral bone is along the angle of union of the squamous and petrous portions, external to the aperture that contains the and ter- carotid artery. Externally it ends in a dilated and somewhat uon!" oval opening with the longest measurement in a vertical direction, and with an irregular margin which gives attach- ment to the special cartilage completing the canal. The Cartiia- cartilagifious part of the tube is nearly an inch in length, part"^ and extends from the temporal bone to the interior of the Use of pharynx. (See p. 134.) Through this tube the mucous the tube, jjjgj^j^pg^jjg tympanum is continuous with that of the pharynx ; and through it, by reason of its inclination down- wards, the mucus passes from that cavity. Mem- The secondary membrane of the tympanum is placed fenestra within the fenestra rotunda, and is rather concave towards rotunda. the tympanum, but convex towards the cochlear passage which it closes. Con- It is formed of three strata, like the membrane on the struction . • i ^ , i , • , i opposite side oi the tympanum, viz. an external or mucous, of three derived from the lining of the tympanum; an internal or serous, continuous with that clothing the cochlea; and a cen- tral layer of fibrous tissue with, according to Pappenheim, some elastic tissue at the circumference.

For the examination of these little bones the student should be pro- vided with some separate dry specimens, besides the ossicles that are in position in the cavity. Malleus The malleus is the longest bone and is twisted and bent: it is large at one end (head) and small and pointed at the other (handle), and has besides two processes, with a nar- head, rowcd part or neck. The head or capitulum is free in the cavity, is oval in shape, and is smooth except at the back, where there is a depression for articulation with the next neck, bone. The neck is the slightly twisted part between the handle, head and the processes. The handle or manubrium decreases in size towards the tip, and is flattened from before back- wards, except at the extremity, where it is compressed from

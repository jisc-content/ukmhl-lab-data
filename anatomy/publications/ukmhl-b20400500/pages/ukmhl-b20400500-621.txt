The body of the penis, formed by but each the union of the corpora cavernosa, is grooved above and ^^te \ ^ behind. below along the middle line, and presents anteriorly a narrowed but truncated extremity that is covered by the glans penis; along its under surface the urethra is conducted. Besides the attachment of the corpora cavernosa by the Jorm crura, the bodv of the penis is connected with the front of attach- , . ment of the symphysis pubis by the suspensory ligament. penis. The corpus sponqiosum urethrce encloses the urethral Corpus -* ■* ^ ^ spongio- canal, and forms the head of the penis. It is a vascular and sum erectile texture, like the corpora cavernosa, but is much less strong. Commencing posteriorly by a dilated part — sur- ^ the bulb, this structure extends forwards around the urethra urethra, to the extremity of the penis, where it swells out into the swells , conical glans penis. The bulb is in front of the triangular ligament of the the buib, urethra, and opposite the point of junction of the crura of the corpora cavernosa. It is directed backwards slightly below the membranous part of the urethra, and is fixed by fibrous tissue to the front of the triancrular ligament. The which is ^ ° lobed, accelerator urinae muscle covers it. The enlargement pre- sents usually a central depression, with a bulging on each side, and is subdivided into two lobes. The glans penis is somewhat conical in form, and covers and the the truncated end of the corpora cavernosa. Its base is gians directed backwards, and is marked by a slightly prominent ^^"^^ border — the corona glandis; it is also sloped obliquely along the under aspect, from the apex to the base. In the apex is a vertical slit, in which the urethral canal terminates ; and below that aperture is an excavation which contains the frsenum preputii. Section III. CONNECTIONS OF THE VISCERA IN THE FEMALE. In the pelvis of the female are contained the lower end of con- the intestinal tube, and the bladder and the urethra, as in the the male; but there are in addition the generative organs, peivis, viz. the uterus with its accessories, and the vagina.

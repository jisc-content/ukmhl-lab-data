DISSECTION OF THE PTERYGOID EEGION. 96 Its offsets are inclined towards the angle of the mouth, supplying the integument, together with the buccinator muscle and the lining mucous membrane. This branch is united freely with the facial nerve, and forms a kind of plexus. Sensory B.

Its course to the surface of the head is first backwards lies be- beneath the external pterygoid muscle, as far as the inner jaw, part of the articulation of the jaw ; and lastly upwards with the temporal artery in front of the ear, and beneath the pa- and sup- rotid gland. In this course the nerve furnishes branches to branch- the surroundiug parts, viz. to the joint, the ear, and the pa- rotid gland, and communicates also with the facial nerve. Its ramifications on the head are described at page 8. In the part now dissected its branches are the following : — to the a. Branches for the meatus auditorius and the articulation.— Two offsets are directed from the point of union of the branches of the facial with the auriculo-temporal nerve to the interior of the and joint auditory meatus, between the cartilage and the bone. The branch ° to the articulation of the jaw is supplied from the trunk of the auri- culo-temporal near the same spot, or from its branches to the meatus. a branch J.

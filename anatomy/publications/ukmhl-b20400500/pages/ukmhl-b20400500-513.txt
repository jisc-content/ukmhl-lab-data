493 INTERNAL OR DIRECT HERNIA. outer third there exists only fascia transversalis. Any intestine protruding in tliis spot must, it is evident, rupture or elongate the different structures, because there is not any aperture or tube by which it can descend, as in the external hernia. Further, the coverings of the hernia, and its extent Hernia and direction in the lower part of the inguinal canal, must space of vary according as the gut is forced through the part of the kinds, space covered by the conjoined tendon, or through the part external to that tendon. Course and coverings of the hernia. — The common kind ^^^^^^^ of the internal hernia (inferior) passes through the inner part ^^^^^^^ of the triangular space which is covered by the conjoined ^^^"^^^^ tendon, and then straight through the abdominal wall to the external ring; since it does not accompany the cord along the inguinal passage. The intestine in protruding carries JJ^jj^^ before it the peritoneum, the subperitoneal fatty membrane, P^^J^^^" and the fascia transversalis ; next, it either elono;ates the ^;at,. ^ fascia conioined tendon, or, as is the case in a sudden rupture, trans-; ^ ^ ^ versalis, separates the fibres, and escapes between them. Then, the ^^"^^^j^^" intestine advances into the lower part of the inguinal canal, don, where it is opposite the external abdominal ring ; and it passes outwards through the ring, lying on the inner side of the cord, and receiving at the same time the covering of the sperma- p . . -r 1 • • • 1 tic fascia, fascia spermatica. Lastly, it is invested by the superficial supers fascia and the skin. In number the coverings of this in- fascia, . 1 • 1 in and skin. ternal hernia are the same as those m the external form; and in kind they are the same, with this exception, viz. that the conjoined tendon is substituted for the cremasteric covering. 8eat of stricture. — The stricture in this form of hernia stric- occurs most frequently at the neck of the sac, next in fre- g-^^^. quency at the margin of the fissured tendon, and lastly at the external abdominal ring. The position of the openings in the abdominal wall should be kept in mind during attempts to reduce an internal hernia; and the straightness of the course of the intestine, in a comparison with an external hernia, should be remembered. Where it is necessary to open the i^s divi- , sion. hernial sac to relieve the stricture, after having divided constricting bands external to the neck, the cut is to be made directly upwards as in the external hernia.

STRUCTURE OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE. 533 M M 3 Microscopic structure of the mucous membrane. — With On the the aid of a lens the surface of the mucous membrane, when are pits well washed, will be seen to be marked all over by shallow veoii; depressions or alveoli, which measure from ^ Jo*^^ t^o^^^ sS'/e'^ of an inch across : these depressions are occupied by the apertures of minute tubes. Generally hexagonal or polygonal shape, in outline, the hollows become larger and more elongated towards the small end of the stomach. Near the pylorus, and ap- pear- too, the margins of the alveoli project, and are irregular, so ance as to resemble rudimentary villi. pylorus. By means of a thin section under the microscope, the The membrane is seen to be formed almost altogether of minute made up vertical tubes that lie side by side, and project into the sub- of smaii mucous tissue. Measuring from s^o^th to g^^gth of an inch across and -^V^h to g^^th of an inch in length, the tubes are closed at the deep end; but they open on the surface of the stomach both in the alveoli, and in the interalveolar spaces. For the most part they are straight, but towards the pylorus "^^if^^^ they become longer and somewhat sacculated at the deep wUh^ extremity. In their interior they are lined by columnar ^^ep epithelium, which becomes spheroidal in the bottom of the ^^^'^^^^ tube; and filling them is a colourless fluid, which contains a li^m; ° contain granular material. fluid. Over the surface of the mucous membrane small lentiform, Foiii- follicles are scattered, which have a depression in the centre, and correspond with the solitary follicles in the intestine. These are in greatest number near the pyloric end of the stomach, and are most marked in young children. A columnar epithelium covers the surface of the mucous Epithe- membrane, and enters the small tubes, as before men~ vering. tioned. ^ Bloodvessels and nerves of the stomach. — The different arteries Arteries, of the stomach, after supplying the muscular coat, ramify in the submucous tissue, and terminate in the mucous coat. From that anastomosis in the submucous stratum, small offsets are continued on the tubes to the inner surface of the mucous membrane, where they form a network. The veins begin in the mucous membrane veins, * A thin submucous stratum of muscular fibres has been described as lying on the outer or deeper surface of the mucous membrane through- out the whole alimentary canal.

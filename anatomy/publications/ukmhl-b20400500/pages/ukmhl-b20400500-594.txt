Smai^i Small branches supplied to the suprarenal body by the external division of this artery are named superior capsular. Some twigs are given by the left artery to the oesophagus, and by the right to the vena cava. The other parietal branches, viz. lumbar and middle sacral, are not dissected in this stage : the former will be seen after the lumbar plexus (p. 586.), and the latter in the pelvis. Common The COMMON ILIAC ARTERY is directed outwards from the extent bifurcation of the aorta to the base of the sacrum, and divides mina-^" into two large trunks opposite the fibro-cartilage between that bone and the last lumbar vertebra : — one of these sup- plies the lower limb (external iliac), and the other enters Connec- the pclvis (internal iliac). Placed obliquely on the vertebral column, the vessel measures about two inches in length, and is covered by the peritoneum, by branches of the sympathetic nerve, and sometimes by the ureter.

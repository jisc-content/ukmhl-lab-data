PREFACE. The plan of this work has been retained without alter- ation in the present edition. It was devised for the purpose of teaching Anatomy by the dissection of the several parts of the Human Body in successive layers or stages; and the mode of proceeding observed in its execution has been thus explained in a former Preface. In the examination of a part or region, the attention of the student is directed first to its limits, to the superfi- cial prominences of bone and muscle, and to the hollows that point out the situation of the subjacent vessels. The different strata interposed between the surface and the bones are next examined in succession, with refer- ence particularly to the natural position of the several objects and their connections with each other, so that they may be observed in much the same order as they would be met with in an operation of surgery. The anatomical description of the whole is likewise arranged in conformity with the mode of dissection, and each bloodvessel, nerve, or other structure, is described only to such an extent as it may be laid bare in the region under examination. In this edition of my " Demonstrations of Anatomy," I have endeavoured to make the work more complete by the correction of inaccuracies, and to render it more efficient, as a guide to dissection, by the introduction of such alterations as greater experience in teaching has shown to be desirable.

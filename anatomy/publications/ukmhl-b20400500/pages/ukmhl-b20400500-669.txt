PUBIC SYMPHYSIS. 649 hollow*, with uneven walls and a sjnovial-looking fluid, is excavated. Here the structure is distinctly fibrous, with large interspersed compound cells. This space varies in size. It usually extends the whole depth of the cartilage, reaching also in some bodies through the whole thickness from before back so as to divide the mass into two collateral pieces ; in others projecting through only a half or a third of the car- tilage. * This hollow is said to increase in pregnangy.

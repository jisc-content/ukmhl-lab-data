749 LIGAMENTS OF THE KNEE JOINT. brane raise the knee on blocks, and open the joint by an knee incision on each side from the front to the back above the patella. When the anterior part of the capsule with the pa- tella is thrown down, a fold (mucous ligament) will be seen extending from the end of the femur to the front of the joint below the patella. On each side of the knee-pan is a similar fold (alar ligament), containing some fat. The limb is afterwards to be taken from this position, and and dis- part of the posterior ligament is to be removed, to lay bare ciai wga. the crucial ligaments at the back of the joint; but the limb is to be replaced in the former position before the structures are learnt. The synovial membrane lines the interior of the capsule, synovial and is continued to the articular ends of the bones. Besides brane covering the capsule, it invests the interarticular cartilages, and sends a pouch between the tendon of the popliteus and the external cartilage and the head of the tibia: it is likewise reflected over the strong crucial ligaments at the back of the joint. On the front of the femur the sac of the membrane extends two inches above the articular surface. In the cen- extends tre of the joint is a fold (mucous ligament) which contains a ticuiar small vessel and some fatty tissue, and extends from the interval between the condyles to the fat below the patella, fjjtofoids On each side of the patella is another fold (alar ligament), JJf^ous occasioned by the fat at this spot, which is continuous with j^ga.^^^"^ the former below the patella. riients.

307 LAYER OF DEEP MUSCLES. X 2 to this muscle and the flexor carpi ulnaris. The muscle is at- has a thick fleshy belly, and ends in four tendons, which last pha are not separate above the annular ligament, and whose destination is the last phalanges of the fingers. The cuta- parts neous surface of the muscle is in contact with the ulnar u?""^ nerve and vessels, and with the superficial flexor of the fingers, and the flexor carpi ulnaris ; and the deep surface rests on the ulna and the pronator quadratus muscle. The outer border touches the flexor pollicis longus and the an- terior interosseous vessels and nerve ; and the inner is con- nected by the aponeurosis to the posterior margin of the ulna. The FLEXOR LONGUS POLLICIS ariscs from the upper Long two thirds of the hollowed anterior surface of the radius, as of low jas the pronator quadratus ; from the outer part of the q^"^|^" interosseous membrane ; and by a round distinct slip from the coronoid process of the ulna, internal to the attachment of the brachialis anticus. The fleshy fibres descend to a tendon, which is continued beneath the annular ligament, and is inserted into the last phalanx of the thumb. On the cutaneous surface of the muscle is the flexor sublimis.

The PRONATOR QUADRATUS is a flat muscle, and occupies Pronator ^ quadra- the lower fourth of the front of the bones of the forearm, '^^ ^'^ lower The muscle arises from the anterior and inner parts of the end of bones of ulna, where it is somewhat the widest, and is inserted into forearm; the fore part of the radius for about two inches. The ^^X anterior surface is covered by the tendons of the flexor muscles of the fingers, and by the radial artery; and the posterior surface rests on the radius and ulna with their intervening membrane, and on the interosseous vessels and nerve. The anterior interosseous artery (p. 304.) is continued j^^"^^^^'"'^'' on the front of the interosseous membrane, between or in osseous ^ artery. the fibres of the deep flexor muscles, till it reaches the aper- ture below that membrane. At that spot the artery turns from the front to the back of the limb, and descends to the posterior surface of the carpus, where it ends by anasto- mosing with the posterior interosseous and carpal arteries.

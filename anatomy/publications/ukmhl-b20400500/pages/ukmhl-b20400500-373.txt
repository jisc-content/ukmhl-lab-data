Their unequal extent on the aspects of the heart has been before alluded to: thus the right ven- The tricle forms the right thin border and the greater part of the anterior surface, and is prolonged upwards on the left side into the pulmonary artery. The left ventricle enters alone The left, into the apex, the left border, and most of the posterior surface of the heart: with its cavity the aorta is connected. Dissection,—Before opening the heart, the vessels for the Dissect / . . coro- nutrition of its substance (coronary arteries) are to be dis- naryves- sels and sected on the surface, together with the small nerves and nerves, veins that accompany them. The two arteries appear on the sides of the pulmonary artery, and occupy the grooves on the surface of the heart, where they are surrounded by fat; one branches over the right, and the other over the left side. With the anterior artery is a plexus of nerves, which is to be followed upwards to the superficial cardiac plexus ; and with the remaining artery is another plexus. At the back of the heart, in the groove between the and co- ronary auricles and ventricles, the student will find the large coro- sinus, nary vein, and the dilated coronary sinus in which it ends: the last should be defined and followed to its ending in tho right auricle. The coronary arteries are two small vessels that are so Two named from their course around the heart: they are the of the heart first branches of the aorta, and arise close above the semi- viz. lunar valves. One is distributed on the right, and the other on the left side of the heart. a. The right coronary branch appears on the right side of right the pulmonary artery, and is directed onwards in the depres- nary", sion between the right auricle and ventricle to the posterior aspect of the heart, where it anastomoses with a similar circular offset from the left coronary artery. In this course branches are distributed upwards and downwards to the right half of the heart. Two of these are of larger size than the rest: — one runs on the anterior aspect of the right ven- tricle towards the free margin; the other descends on the back of the heart, along the septum between the ventricles.

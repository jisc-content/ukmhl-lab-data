This offset ascends from the upper part of the ganglion, of which it appears to be a continuation.

In the carotid canal communications are formed with the tympanic nerve (p. 115.) and with the spheno-palatine ganglion (p. 148.); the former being placed near the lower, and the latter near the upper opening of the canal. The communications and plexuses that these nerves form in their course to the base of the brain are described at p. 22. to pha- 2.

Cardiac nerves.— The cardiac nerves enter the thorax plexuses, to join in the cardiac plexuses of the heart. There are three cardiac nerves on each side, viz. superior, middle, and infe- rior, each taking its name from the ganglion of which it is an offset. One The superior or superficial cardiac nerve of the right side con- deep^ tinues through the neck, behind the sheath of the carotid vessels, plexus g^jjfj enters the thorax beneath, or in front of the subclavian artery.

In one instance (Quain), it was noticed between two and three inches below the elbow joint, and in that case a vas aberrans connected it and with the axillary artery.

In the forearm it may be likewise subcutaneous, and superficial to the supinator longus muscle. Connect- The aberrant arteries^ " vasa aberrantia," or the long slender branch- branches of the axillary or brachial trunks, open commonly into the radial artery. In some cases of high origin of the radial, there is a connecting branch, at the bend of the elbow, between that irregular vessel and the trunk in the place of the brachial Dissec artery. Dissection. — To bring into view the remaining muscle of the superficial layer (flexor sublimis digitorum), the origin of the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus must be cut through near the inner condyle of the humerus, and turned to one side. Small branches of the ulnar artery and median nerve may be seen to enter the under surface of those muscles. For the present, the pronator teres may be left Super- uncut. flexor of The FLEXOR DIGITORUM SUBLIMIS Vcl PERFORATUS is the lingers, j^^^^^g^ ^^iq muscles of the superficial layer, and is named Origin, from its position to another flexor in the deep layer of muscles. It arises from the inner condyle of the humerus, from the internal lateral ligament, and from the intermus- cular septa, in common vrith the preceding muscles; and it takes origin in addition from the bones of the forearm, viz. j from the inner part of the coronoid process of the ulna; and j from the oblique line extending from the tubercle of the ) radius; as well as from the anterior border of that bone as far as tw^o inches below the insertion of the pronator

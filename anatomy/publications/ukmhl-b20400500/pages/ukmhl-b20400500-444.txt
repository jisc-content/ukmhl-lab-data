Semi- The SEMispiNALis occupics the vertebral groove in the spinalis ^^^g^]^ cervical regions, and extends from the transverse is di- and articular processes to the spines of the vertebrae. The into^ lower part of the muscle is called semispinalis dorsi, and the upper ^art semispinalis colli, semi- The semispinalis dorsi arises from the transverse pro- dors^^ cesses of the dorsal vertebrae, from the tenth to the sixth ; and is inserted into the spinous processes of the upper four dorsal and the last two cervical vertebrae, semi. The semispinalis colli arises from the transverse processes coiih^'^ of the upper five or six dorsal vertebrae, and from the articular processes of the cervical vertebrae, except the first three: it is inserted into the spines of the cervical vertebras above the attachment of the semispinalis dorsi, the atlas not receiving any slip. Connec- The scmispinalis muscle is covered by the complexus, and by the deep cervical artery and the cervical nerves. To its inner side is the multifidus spinae muscle. Inter- * The INTERSPINAL MUSCLES are placed as their name ex- mu"cies presses: they are arranged in pairs, a muscle being on each in pairs ^.^^ iutcrspinous ligament, and are best seen in the neck and loins. in the In the cervical region the muscles are situate between the ' spinous processes, but they are absent from the interval be- tween those of the first two vertebrse. They are small round bundles, and are attached above and below to the bifurcated blck^ apices of the spines.

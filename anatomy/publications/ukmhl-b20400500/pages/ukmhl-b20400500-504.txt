DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 484 Cover- Its scveral coverings are derived from the different strata in the wall of the abdomen, except from the transversalis muscle. Thus, in proceeding from within outwards, the student will find the following layers around the constituents of the cord: — first the subperitoneal fat, then the tube of the fascia transversalis, next the cremaster muscle — conti- nuous with the internal oblique, afterwards the intercolumnar fascia from the external oblique muscle, and lastly the superficial fascia and the skin.

Dissec- Dissection, — The constituents of the cord will be dis- played by turning aside the different surrounding layers, and removing the connective tissue. The dissector should trace branches of the genito-crural nerve and epigastric artery into the cremasteric covering, consti- Vessels and nerves of the cord.— In the cord are collected tuents of T -, , • ■ T • 1 1 ' the cord, together the spermatic artery and veins that convey the blood to, and take it away from the testis ; nerves and lym- phatics of the testicle ; and the vas deferens or the efferent duct. sperma- The Spermatic artery is a branch of the aorta. It enters tery; the cord through the internal abdominal ring, and descends to the testis, in which it ends : it distributes branches to the vas deferens and the epididymis. In the female, a branch from the ovarian artery (spermatic ?) enters the round liga- veins. mcut. The spermatic veins leave the posterior part of the testicle, and receive branches from the epididymis : ascend- ing in the cord, in front of the vas deferens, they divide and anastomose, and form the spermatic plexus.

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 476 Parts CO- Parts covered hii external ohlique.— Beneath tlie external, vered by , , external IS the internal oblique muscle, with the ribs and the inter- oblique. costal muscles. At the lower part of the abdomen the outer muscle conceals the cord, and the branches of nerves from the lumbar plexus contained in the abdominal wall. The aponeurosis of the external oblique is placed in front of the sheath of the rectus. Internal The INTERNAL OBLIQUE MUSCLE is fleshy below and apo- muscie. neurotic above, just the reverse of the preceding muscle; and its fibres (except the lowest) ascend across the direction Origin of those of the external oblique. The muscle arises alons from ^ pelvis, the outer half of Poupart's ligament, along the anterior two thirds of the crest of the hip bone, and from the tendon of the transversalis muscle (fascia lumborum) in the interval inser- between that bone and the last rib. The fibres diverge on tion into ^ the ribs the abdomen to their destination; — The posterior fleshy andlinea ^ ^ ^ ^ ^iiba, fibres ascend to be inserted into the cartilages of the lower three ribs, and join the internal intercostal muscles of the except lowest two spaccs.

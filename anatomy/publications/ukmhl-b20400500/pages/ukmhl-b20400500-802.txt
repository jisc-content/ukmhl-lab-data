DISSECTION OF THE EYE, 782 structed of minute parallel fibres. No bloodvessels are found in its texture. It consists mostly of albumen. Fo'^of The lamince of each surface have their apices in the minae; centre, whcro the septa meet, and may be detached from one another at that spot, and turned outwards. The constituent structed ^^^^^ of the laminae are about 5 oVo*^ inoh in diameter, nute^" solid and rather flat, and most flattened at the margin of the fibres igns. The deeper fibres are narrowed and less distinct, wavy^at The cdgcs are slightly wavy, and each fibre touches six the edge, Q^j^^pg. yj^. two ou cach sidc, ouc abovc, and another below; fached" contiguous fibrcs are therefore dovetailed together, and this septaV interlocking is best seen in the lens of the codfish. They €nds[ connected at their extremities to the partitions on the opposite surfaces of the lens in this way : those that are at- tached to the pole or the spot where the septa meet on the one aspect, are fixed to the extremity of a septum on the other aspect; and the rest of the fibres passing between two septa, begin and end at points that are not corresponding. Changes Changes with age,—In infancy the lens is situate further tion; forwards than in adult age, and touches the iris. Its form form, is nearly spherical in the fetus, but its convexity decreases with age, particularly on the anterior aspect, until the lens colour, becomes flattened in old people. In the fetus it is reddish and ^ ^ . . , ^ m colour, is soit, and is not quite transparent; m youth and consist- mature age it is firm and clear ; and in old age it becomes denser and of a yellowish colour.

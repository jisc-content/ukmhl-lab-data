320 DISSECTION OF THE FOREARM. To define the ligament the small muscles of the thumb and little finger must be taken from it. Before reading the description of this structure, the ends of the cut ligament should be placed in apposition. Annular The anterior annular liqament is a firm ligamentous band ligament ^ ^ ^ of front that arches over and binds down the flexor tendons of the of wnst. fingers. It is attached externally to the front of the os scaphoides, and to the fore and inner part, as well as the ridge of the os trapezium; and internally to the unciform and pisiform bones. By its upper border it is connected with the aponeurosis of the forearm, and by its anterior surface with the palmar fascia. On the cutaneous surface lie the palmaris longus and the ulnar artery and nerve. Dissec- Dissection, — Next follow the tendon of the flexor carpi tion. T T radialis to its insertion, and dissect out more fully the attachment of the biceps and brachialis anticus muscles to the bones of the forearm. Insertion The tendon of the flexor carpi radialis^ in passing from rion^of the forearm to the hand, lies in the groove in the os tra- carpT pezium between the atta<ihments of the annular ligament radiahs. ^-j^^ bono, but outsido the arch of that ligament: here it is bound down by a fibrous sheath, lined by a synovial mem- brane. The tendon is inserted into the base of the meta- carpal bones of the index and middle fingers. Insertion The insertion of the brachialis anticus takes place by a chiaifs" broad thick tendon, about an inch in extent, which is fixed anticus. Ijj^q ^^^q anterior rough part of the coronoid process of the ulna. inser.. ^ Insertion of the biceps. — The tendon of the biceps is the^ ' inserted into the inner part of the tubercle of the radius, and tendon, into the bouc behind it. A bursa is found between it and the bone. Near its attachment the tendon changes the direction of its surfaces; the anterior surface becoming external, and vice versa. The supinator brevis muscle partly surrounds the insertion. Section VI. the back of the forearm. Position, — During the dissection of the back of the fore- arm, the limb lies with the fore part down, and a small

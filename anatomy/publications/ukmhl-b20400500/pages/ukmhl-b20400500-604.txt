DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 584 compa- in the abdominal wall, and its distribution over the scrotum and the groin, are before noticed (p. 468. 481.). May be The size of this nerve depends upon that of the ilio-hypo- gastric branch ; and the nerve may be absent if the latter is large. Genito- The genito-cvural nerve is distributed, as the name ex- ^^^"^^^ presses, to the genital organs and the limb. It arises from the second lumbar nerve, and from the connecting loop be- pierces twccn this and the first: it soon pierces the fibres of the psoas, and descending on the surface of the muscle divides and into a genital and a crural branch. Sometimes the nerve is fnto^^^ divided in the psoas, and the branches perforate separately the muscle. genital a. The genital branch descends on the external iliac ar- tery, and furnishes offsets around it; it passes from the abdomen v^ith the spermatic vessels, and is distributed in the cremaster muscle. In the female the nerve is lost in the round ligament. crural b. The crural branch issues beneath Poupart's ligament to supply the integument of the thigh. (See Cutaneous Nerves of the Thigh.) Course The external cutaneous nerve of the thigh arises from the nafcuti- second nerve of the plexus, or from the loop between it and nerve in the third, and appears about the middle of the outer border domen" of 1^6 psoas. The nerve then takes an oblique course across the^^^^ the iliacus to the interval between the anterior iliac spinous thigh, processes, and leaves the abdomen beneath Poupart's liga- ment, to be distributed on the outer aspect of the limb. Origin The anterior crural nerve is by far the largest offset of of ante- rior cru- the plcxus, and supplies branches to the extensor muscles of nerve, the knee joint, and the front of the thigh. Taking origin from the third and fourth nerves, and receiving a fiiscicuius also from the second, this large nerve appears towards the ^Tthe^ lower part of the psoas, and then lies between that muscle and abdo- iliacus.

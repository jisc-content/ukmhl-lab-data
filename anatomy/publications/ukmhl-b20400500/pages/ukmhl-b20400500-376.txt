DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 356 the anterior wall to the auricula. By means of these cuts an opening will be made of sufficient size ; and on raising the flaps with hooks or pieces of thread, and removing the coagulated blood, the shape of the cavity will be apparent. Form of The CAVITY OF THE RIGHT AURICLE * is rather of an irre- auricie. gular form, though when seen from the right side, with the flaps held up as above directed, it has somewhat the appear- ance of a cone, with the base to the right and the apex to the left. Its base; The hase or wider part of the cavity is turned towards the right side, and at its extremities are the openings of the superior and inferior cavae. Between those vessels the wall of the cavity projects somewhat, and presents a slight ele" apex. vation in some bodies (tubercle of Lower). The apex is prolonged downwards towards the junction of the auricle with the ventricle, and in it is the large opening into the right ventricular cavity. Anterior The anterior wall is thin and loose. Near its upper part auricula Opening leading into the pouch of the appendix or auricula, which will admit the tip of the little finger. Around, and in the interior of the appendix, are fleshy bands, named musculi pectinati, which cross in different directions, forming a network that contrasts with the general smoothness of the auricle. Poste- The posterior wall corresponds for the most part, in cou- rier wall ^ is^mark- sequcncc of the position of the heart, to the septum between fossa the auricles. On it, nearer the inferior than the superior ovalis. , . â€ž . . . cava, IS a large oval depression, the fossa ovalis, which is the remains of an opening in the fetus between the auricles. Inferiorly the fossa merges into the opening of the lower cava. A thin semitransparent structure forms the bottom of the fossa, and there is oftentimes a small oblique aperture at its upper part. Around the upper three fourths of that hollow is an elevated band of muscular fibre, called annulus Annuius scu isthmus Vicusscnii, which is most prominent above and sens!*^"^' on the inner side, and gradually subsides inferiorly.

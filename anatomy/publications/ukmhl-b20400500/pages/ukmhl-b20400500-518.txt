Along the front of the space, but outside the tube of membrane, lies the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female.

Side IS the femoral vein; and above this, on the outer side, are the epigastric vessels. In front is a small branch (pubic) from the epigastric artery to the back of the pubes ; and the vessels of the spermatic cord may be said to be placed along the anterior aspect of the ring.

In that course it may have two posi- tions with respect to the ring: either it lies close to the iliac vein, and therefore on the outer side of the ring ; or it arches over the ring, descending on the inner side, at the base of Gimbernat's ligament. If the artery takes the first-men- tioned course, which is the most frequent arrangement, the inner side of the ring will be still free from vessels; but in the other condition the ring will have an additional vessel on the inner side, and will be entirely encircled except at the posterior part.

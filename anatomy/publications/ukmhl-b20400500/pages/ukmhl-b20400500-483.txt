463 MUSCLES OF THE PERINEUM. the bone, and the outer fibres of the sphincter vaginae are to liga- ment, be removed. The triangular ligament transmits the urethra, but is not j^J^Jj"^"" quite so strongly marked as in the male; its extent is partly "^ent. interrupted behind by the large aperture of the vagina, (p. 461.). Dissection, â€” By cutting through the superficial layer of To see muscles the ligament in the same way as in the male, the deep of ure. muscles, with the pudic vessels and nerve and their branches, will be arrived at. Afterwards the trunks of those vessels, and of the pudic nerve, are to be traced backwards. The DEEP TRANSVERSE MUSCLE (dcprcssor urethras, San- JJeep torini) has the same origin externally as in the male, and it J^^^J^^j^ meets its fellow at the middle line. Santorini described the muscle as passing over, instead of below the urethra ; hence the name given to it by its discoverer. The CONSTRICTOR MUSCLE of the urethra resembles that Con- strictor of the male in its origin from the pubes, and its disposition urethras, around the urethra. Within it is also a circular layer of involuntary fibres of the urethra, as in the other sex. The description of the pudic artery (p. 458.) will serve Pudic for both sexes, except that the branch in the female, corre- sponding to the artery of the bulb in the male, is furnished to the vagina. The terminal branches are much smaller too in the female. The pudic nerve has the same peculiarity as the artery Pudic with respect to the branches to the vagina, and the smaller size of the terminal part of the nerve on the clitoris.

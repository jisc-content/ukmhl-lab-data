5 B 3 TEMPORAL MUSCLE, the fibres descend converging around a tendon, and are inserted by its means into the under surface of the coronoid l^^^""-^^^ process of the lower jaw. On the cutaneous surface is the temporal fascia, with the parts superficial to that mem- brane ; and concealed by the muscle are the deep temporal \9^^^^' vessels and nerves which ramify in it. The insertion of the muscle underneath the zygoma will be afterwards followed. Dissection.— For the dissection of the vessels and nerves ^ow to let the head be turned to the left side, and let an incision be skin oa . . right carried along the eyebrow and zygoma to a little behind the side, ear, in order that the piece of skin, on the opposite half of the head, may be removed. The fiap of integument is then to be raised from before backwards, but the subcutaneous fat should be left till the nerves are found. Behind the ear the skin should be reflected as on the other side, so as to uncover the posterior auricular vessels and nerves. Along the eyebrow seek the branches of vessels and nerves seek ° •/ nerves ' that come from the orbit, viz. the supra-orbital and frontal and ves- ^ sels in vessels, and the supra-orbital and supra-trochlear nerves, front;, They lie at first beneath the muscular fibres, and the student must cut through these to find them: the supra-orbital branches issue opposite the middle, and the supra-trochlear near the inner part of the orbit. On the side of the head, in front of the ear, the super- ""^^^^^. ficial temporal vessels and nerves are to be found; and somewhat above the zygoma are branches of the facial and superior maxillary nerves, whose offsets join. Behind the ear and below it, the posterior auricular vessels and nerve, and branches from the great auricular nerve to the tip and back of the ear, are to be seen ; one or more offsets of the last should be traced to their junction with the posterior auricular nerve. At the back of the head the ramifications of the occipital {J^^^^ vessels, with the large and small occipital nerves, should be sought out; the former nerve lies by the side of the artery, and the latter about midway between this and the ear. Cutaneous Vessels. — The arteries of the scalp are fur- J^l^^^^' nished by the internal and external carotid arteries, and scaip. anastomose freely over the side of the head. Only two small branches, the supra-orbital and frontal, come from the

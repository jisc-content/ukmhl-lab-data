The muscles increase in size from above down, and their fibres have the same direction as the external intercostal layer. The first is fixed above to the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra, and below to the outer surface of the first rib. other In some of the four lower muscles a few fibres are con- muscles. tinned beyond one rib to that next succeeding. These longer slips have been named levatores longiores costarum.

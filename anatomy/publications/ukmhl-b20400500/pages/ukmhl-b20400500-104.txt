Branch- All the branches, except the ascending pharyngeal, lingual, seen are and internal maxillary, may now be examined; but those three will be afterwards described with the regions they occupy. Superior The Superior thyroid artery arises near the cornu of the thyroid, iiyoides, and runs downwards on the inner side of the common carotid artery, passing beneath the omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles, to the thyroid has off- body, to which it is distributed on the anterior aspect. This branch is superficial in the anterior triangle, and furnishes offsets to the lowest constrictor as well as to the muscles beneath which it lies, in addition to the following named branches:— tj^g a. The hyoid branch is very inconsiderable in size, and runs in- bone^ wards below the hyoid bone : it supplies the parts attached to that bone, and anastomoses with the vessel of the opposite side, sterno- ^- ^ branch for the sterno-mastoid muscle lies in front of the musde^ sheath of the common carotid artery, and is distributed chiefly to the muscle from which it takes its name, to la- The laryngeal branch pierces the membrane between the hyoid rynx, "bone and thyroid cartilage, with the superior laryngeal nerve, and ends in the interior of the larynx, to crico- d.

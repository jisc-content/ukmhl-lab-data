Small arteries to each intercostal space and the surface of the thorax, as well as the intercostal nerves, are to be preserved. The surface of the triangularis sterni will be made apparent, after the removal of the cartilages, by cleaning the loose tissue and fat from it. Triangu- The TRIANGULARIS STERNI is a thin musclc, which is placed laris ... sterni insido the cavity of the thorax, and beneath the costal car- tilages. It arises internally from the side of the xiphoid cartilage, from the side of the sternum as high as the third cartilage, and from the three or four lower sternal costal car- tilages. Its fibres are directed outwards, the upper being tho"a^^ most oblique, and are inserted by fieshy fasciculi into all the tached to ^^^^ ^^^^ exccpt the last two and the first, at the junction of the ribs, j^]^^ bouc and cartilage, and into the aponeurosis in the inter- costal spaces. The muscle is covered by the ribs and the internal intercostal muscles, and by the internal mammary connec- vcsscls and the intercostal nerves. It lies on the pleura; tions. ^ its lower fibres are continuous with those of the transver- salis abdominis. Internal The internal mammary artery is a branch of the sub- mam- . ^7^7 mary clavian (p. 74.), and enters the thorax beneath the cartilage branch of tlic first rib. It is continued throu2fh the thorax, lyini? clavian j beneath the costal cartilages and about half an inch from the sternum, as far as the interval between the sixth and seventh ribs ; here it gives externally a large muscular branch (mus- courses culo-phrcnic), and then passing beneath the seventh rib, through ^ ^ X o thorax to eutcrs the sheath of the rectus muscle of the wall of the abdo- abdo- naen. nacu.

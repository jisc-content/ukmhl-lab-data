Scat- tered through the fibrous membrane are branched yellow or brown pigment cells, which in the neck are so numerous as to give it a darkish appearance. tnds Where the medulla spinalis ceases, viz. about the lower in^e- . part of the body of the first lumbar vertebra, the investing riorly in - ^ o a fibrous tube of the pia mater is suddenly reduced in size, and has piece, X J 7 the appearance of a round fibrous cord.

Situate between the anterior and posterior roots of the nerves, the band reaches upwards to the medulla oblongata, and ends inferiorly on the lower pointed extremity of the cord. Internally it is united to the pia mater. Externally it ends in a series of triangular or tooth-like projections, which are fixed at and on intervals along the dura mater, each being about midway dura between the apertures of transmission of the roots of the points, spinal nerves. There are twenty or twenty-one of these denticulations, of which the first is attached to the dura Number mater opposite the margin of the occipital foramen, between tach- the vertebral artery and the hypoglossal nerve ; and the last these, is inserted opposite the last dorsal or the first lumbar vertebra. This fibrous band supports the spinal cord, and has been called a ligament from that circumstance.

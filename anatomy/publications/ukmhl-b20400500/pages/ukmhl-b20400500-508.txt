To raise upwards the muscle, its lower fleshy origin from Poupart's ligament must be detached. For this purpose let one incision be made Reflect across the fleshy part of the internal oblique, from the iliac oblique. crest towards the linea alba; and after the depth of the muscle has been ascertained by the layer of connective and fatty tissues beneath it, let the lowest fibres be carefully cut through at their origin from Poupart's ligament. By de- taching the muscle cautiously, the student will be able to raise it from the subjacent transversalis, so that it may be turned upwards on the abdomen : the separation of the two muscles just mentioned is sometimes difficult in consequence of their fibres being blended together, but a branch of the circumflex iliac artery marks their intermuscular space. The cremaster muscle is then to be divided along the cord, and to be reflected to the sides. Clean Let the dissector clean the surface of the transversalis cent muscle, without displacing its lower arched border, and trace with care the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis, to show its exact extent outwards. The fascia transversalis and the spermatic cord should be likewise nicely cleaned. Crossing the interval apparent below the

BISSECTION OF THE FRONT OF THE FOREARM. S98 1 Define The anterior annular ligament of tlie wrist, which arches annular over the tcndons passing to the hand, is next to be defined, anent. This Structure is at some little depth from the surface; whilst the student attempts to make it apparent by removing the tissue superficial to it, he must take care of the small branches of the median and ulnar nerves to the palm of the hand. The ulnar artery and nerve pass over the ligament, <and will serve as a guide to it. 'Hollow Hollow in front of the elbow, — The hollow in front of if the" the bend of the elbow corresponds with that of the popliteal space in the leg, and is situate between the inner and the outer mass of the muscles of the forearm. This interval is somewhat triangular in shape, and the wider part is towards Bounda- the humerus. Laterally, it is bounded on the outer side by the supinator longus muscle, and on the inner side by the pronator teres. The aponeurosis of the limb is stretched over the space; and the bones, covered by the brachialis anticus and supinatorbrevismuscles, form the deep boundary, conterfts Contents, — In this hollow are lodged the termination of space the brachial artery with its veins and the median nerve, the musculo-spiral nerve, the tendon of the biceps muscle, and some fatty tissue ; these several parts have the following re- :andtheir lativo position in the space : — the tendon of the biceps is ?oone" directed towards the outer boundary to reach the radius, ;another. .^^^ "which it is inserted; and the musculo-spiral nerve is close to the outer side, being partly concealed by the supi- nator longus muscle. The brachial vessels and the median nerve occupy nearly the centre of the space, the nerve being internal; but as the artery is inclining to the outer part of the limb, they are soon distant from one another about half an inch. In this space the brachial artery divides into two trunks—radial and ulnar, superfi. Muscles on the front of the forearm. — The mus- layer clcs oi\ the autcrior and inner parts of the forearm are muscles, divided into a superficial and a deep layer. In the super- ficial layer there are five muscles, which are fixed to the inner condyle of the humerus, mostly by a common tendon, and lie in the undermentioned order from the middle to the inner side of the limb ; viz. pronator radii teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor carpi ulnaris, which are on the same level; and deeper and larger than any of these is

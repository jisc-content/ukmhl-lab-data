DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 390 and above tlie same spot the thoracic duct will be found to the left of the tube. Three Structure. — If a piece of the middle of the gullet be in it. removed and distended with cotton wool, it will be found to consist of a muscular, a fibrous, and a mucous coat. Amus- The muscular coat is thick and strong, and consists of coat of two layers of fibres; the external of these is longitudinal, and the internal circular in direction, like the muscular tunic of the other parts of the alimentary tube. In the upper third of the oesophagus the fibres are red, and have the voiun- striated or voluntary muscular fibres mixed with the invo- involun- luntary; but below this the striated fibres gradually dis- ffbres. appear, the colour becoming paler with their absence, and then only involuntary muscular fibres remain. Exter- The external layer is formed of parallel longitudinal gitudinal fibres, which form an entire covering, and end below on the t^ten-^'^ stomach. The fibres begin by longitudinal bands opposite points' the cricoid cartilage (p. 139.); and at intervals vary- " ing from half an inch to an inch and a half, they are con- nected with tendinous points (gV*^ to*^ v[\q\^ long, and gLth wide) like the fibres of the rectus abdominis muscle. and in- The internal layer of circular fibres is continuous above ternal . ci^cidar with the fibres of the pharynx; these are more oblique at the middle than at either end of the oesophagus. a)at°"^ The JihrQUS layer is between the muscular and mucous coats, and attaches one to another loosely. Mucous The mucous coat or lining will be seen on cutting open the tube to be reddish in colour above, but pale below, and of some thickness. It is very loosely connected with the mus- cular coat, and is thrown into longitudinal folds when the oesophagus is contracted. Lining the interior is a thick layer of scaly epithelium, and the surface is studded with minute papillae. Some compound glands (oesophageal) are scattered along the tube ; and at the lower part of the gullet they form a ring (cardiac glands) close to the stomach.

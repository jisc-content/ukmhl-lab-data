The strong tendinous cords Attach- .1111 ment of ascend to be attached to the valve m the lateral notches be- cords, tween the tongues, and each of the large papillary muscles acts on both divisions of the valve. The ending of the ten- dinous cords on the surface of the segments is the same as in the tricuspid valve. The opening of the aorta is somewhat on a higher level Aortic than that of the auricle, and is next the septum of the ven- tricles. By slitting up the side of the vessel without cutting position the pulmonary artery, its aperture will be found to be round, form, and rather smaller than that of the pulmonary artery, be- neath, and below and internal to which it lies : with respect to the wall of the thorax, it is opposite the lower border of the third left costal cartilage, behind the contiguous part of the sternum. In its interior are three semilunar or sigmoid isguard- ^ ed by valves^ which are larger and stronger than the corresponding three^ ^ parts in the pulmonary artery, but have a like structure, valves, attachment, and function. The projection in the centre of each valve, viz. corpus s. nodulus Arantii, is also better marked. Opposite each valve the coat of the aorta is bulged as on the right side, though in a greater degree, and presents also a little hollow on the inner side named sinus of Valsalva. Above the free margin of two of the small valves are the apertures of the coronary arteries. Position of the ventricular apertures. — Two openinsrs Relative . -IP . p . position have been seen m each ventricle, one of the auricle of its own of the side of the heart, and one of an artery. The apertures of tures: the arteries (aorta and pulmonary) are nearest the septum; and as the two vessels were originally formed from one tube, they are close together, but the pulmonary artery is the more anterior of the two. The aperture of communication with each auricle is next the circumference of the heart, and is posterior in its position to the artery that issues from the fore part of the ventricle. The position of the openings to one another, from before backwards, has been before referred from ' ' before to;—thus the right auriculo-ventricular is before the left; back, and the opening of the pulmonary artery is before that of the aorta, and rather higher than it.

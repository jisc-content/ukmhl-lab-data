Posteriorly the ioint is covered by the external rotator Muscles *^ . . around. muscles, and anteriorly by the psoas and iliacus, a bursa being between them. Above is the gluteus medius, and below is the obturator externus. Dissection. — The capsular ligament should be divided cut open ^ ^ ^ the cap- over the prominence of the head of the femur, and this bone ^uie. disarticulated to see the cotyloid and interarticular liga- ments. The cotyloid ligament is a band of fibro-cartilage, which is f^^ty- fixed to the margin of the acetabulum, and is prolonged gament across the notch on the inner side, so as to form part of the transverse ligament. It is thickest at its attachment to the bone, and becomes gradually thinner towards the free mar- attached , , , , around gin, where it is applied to the head of the femur. This liga- ment deepens the socket for the femur in the same manner as the glenoid ligament increases the surface for the reception of the head of the humerus. The transverse Uqament is a firm but narrow band, which Trans. verse li- reaches across the notch at the inner side of the acetabulum : gament, how it consists partly of special fibres that are attached to the formed, margins of the notch, and partly of some from the cotyloid ligament. Beneath it is an aperture by which the vessels forms a enter the acetabulum to nourish the fat in the bottom of that with hollow. The interarticular ligament (ligam. teres) is a strong band j^g^-J^^j^^ connecting the femur with the innominate bone. One extre- mity is roundish, and is inserted into the pit in the head of the femur ; the other is bifid, and is connected to the sides is divid- of the notch in the cotyloid cavity, the lowest lip of the notch ternaiiy. receiving the strongest band. A synovial membrane lines the capsular ligament, and is synovial continued along it to the acetabulum and the head of the brane. femur. In the bottom of the cotyloid cavity it is reflected over the fat in that situation, and surrounds the ligamentum teres. Dissection.—To see the surface of the acetabulum J^l^j^.^^^^ lower limb is to be separated from the trunk by dividing the interarticular ligament, and cutting through any parts that attach it to the rest of the body.

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 536 ones are about two inches long, with two-thirds of an inch formed depth towards the centre. Each valve is formed of a doubling of the mucous membrane, which encloses vessels between the layers. Extent The valves begin in the duodenum, about one or two intls- inches beyond the pylorus, and are continued in regular *^"^* succession to the middle of the jejunum; but beyond that point they become smaller, and more distant from one another, and finally disappear about the middle of the ileum, having previously become irregular and rudimentary. The valvulse are largest and most regular beyond, and not far from the opening of the bile duct. Opening The aperture of the common bile and pancreatic ducts is duct; a narrow orifice, from three to four inches from the pylorus, where and is situatc in a small prominence on the mucous mem- brane of the duodenum, at the inner and posterior part of the intestine. A probe passed into the bile duct will show the oblique or valvular course (half an inch) through the Some- wall of the intestine. Sometimes the pancreatic duct opens times double, by a distinct orifice. be^iearnt Microscopic structuvc of the mucous membrane. — With intes- microscope, and with fresh pieces of intestine, the student will be able to make out the nature of the villi, the several glandular structures, and the epithelium. The villi Villi.— When the mucus is washed away from a piece of cover ^ , the sur- the lowcr part of the duodenum, and this is examined in face; ^ water, the mucous membrane will be found to be studded over very thickly with small projections, which give it the appearance of velvet. Existing along the whole of the small intestine, both on the valves and between them, these shape bodies are irregular in form, some being triangular, others size, conical, or cylindrical with a large end. Their length is from tb to -^-^th. of an inch. They are best marked where and the valvulae conniventes are largest; there their number is estimated at 50 to 90 in a square line, but in the lower end of the ileum at only 40 to 70 over the same surface.—Krause.

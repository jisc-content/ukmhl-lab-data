Position. — On the dorsum of the foot it is often removed farther outwards than the direction of a line from the centre of the ankle to the posterior part of the first interosseous space. and^dor. Substitution. — The place of the dorsal artery of the foot may be tery. taken by a large anterior peroneal artery. Divide Dissection.—To examine the extensor brevis digitorum sor^on- on the dorsum of the foot, cut through the tendons of the extensor longus and peroneus tertius below the annular ligament, and throw them towards the toes. The attachment of the muscle to the os calcis should be defined. Exten- The EXTENSOR BREVIS DIGITORUM is a short thin musclc vis on the dorsum of the foot. It arises from the outer surface of the OS calcis in front of the groove for the peroneus brevis muscle, and from the anterior annular ligament (the sends lower band) ; the muscle ends in four tendons, which spring to four from as many fleshy bellies, and are inserted into the four toes; inner toes. The tendon to the great toe has a distinct attachment to the base of the metatarsal phalanx ; but the ^ rest are united to the outer side of the tendons of the long extensor, and assist to form the expansion on the metatarsal insertion phalanx (p. 741.). The muscle lies on the tarsus, and is ' partly concealed by the tendons of the long extensor. Its inner tendon crosses the dorsal artery of the foot. Cut Dissection, —The branches of artery and nerve which are through , *^ extensor beneath the extensor brevis will be laid bare by dividing Ijrevis. . n -i -r» that muscle near its front, and turning it upwards. By cutting through the lower band of the annular ligament over the tendon of the extensor pollicis, and throwing outwards the external half of it, the different sheaths of the ligament, the attachment to the os calcis, and the origin of the extensor brevis digitorum from it may be observed. Follow The anterior tibial and musculo-cutaneous nerves are to be nerves, followcd upwards to their origin from the external popliteal; and a small branch from the same nerve is to be traced through the tibialis anticus to the knee joint.

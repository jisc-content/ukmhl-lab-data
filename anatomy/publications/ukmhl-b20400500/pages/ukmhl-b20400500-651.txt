THE RECTUM. 631 s s 4 THE RECTUM. The lower end of the lar^e intestine, which is contained Rectum . .is in the pelvis, is not sacculated like the colon, but is smooth smooth, on the surface. Dissection. — The rectum is to be washed out, and then To pre- distended with air; and the peritoneum and the loose lat are gut. to be removed from it. The rectum is about eight inches in length, and its Length; average diameter is that of the sigmoid flexure of the colon. Its size is uniform till towards the lower extremity, where it g™g"" is dilated, particularly in old people, but at the aperture of termination in the anus the gut is smaller than in any other part of its extent. The longitudinal bands of the colon are absent from this portion of the alimentary canal, and the fibres are spread over the surface. Structure. — The rectum, like the rest of the larsre in- ' o coats as testine, contains in its wall a peritoneal, a muscular, a ^^J^^^ mucous, and a submucous stratum. In it the muscular and J^^,.^"- ' testme. the mucous layers have certain peculiarities that serve to distinguish this from other parts of the intestinal tube. The peritoneum forms but an incomplete covering, audits Perito- arrangement is referred to in the description of the connec- tions of the pelvic viscera (p. 594.). The muscular coat consists of two planes of fibres, as in ^^uscu- ^ ' lar coat the oesophagus, viz. a superficial or longitudinal, and a deep or circular: these fibres belong to the pale or unstriated kind. The longitudinal fibres are continuous with those in the gftu^^i";^ bands on the colon, but are here difi'used to form a stratum around the gut. The circular fibres describe arches around the intestine, ^"f ' cular and become thicker and stronger towards the lower ex- tremity, where they are collected into the band of the internal sphincter muscle. The mucous coat is more moveable than that in the colon, ^"^^"^ and resembles in this respect the lining of the oesophagus; it is also thicker and more vascular than that of the rest of f^f^ the large intestine. When the bowel is contracted the ^^^^^^^r. mucous lining is thrown into numerous accidental folds, J^""}^^

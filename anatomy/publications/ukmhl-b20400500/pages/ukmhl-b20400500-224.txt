Afterwards the remaining part of the pyramid is to be separated by dividing the fibres it receives from the decussation. Lateral The lateral tract of the medulla is continuous inferiorly fibres of ^-^j^ ^j^^ portiou of the spinal cord between the anterior and posterior roots of the nerves, and is prolonged superiorly in greater part to the cerebrum, but it gives an offset to the cerebellum. Soon after entering the medulla oblongata, it is divided into three sets of fibres, external, internal, and middle. The external fibres are both superficial and deep, aremuch and, joining the restiform body, reach the cerebellum; the mlduiial internal offset enters the pyramid of the opposite side; whilst the middle fibres, the continuation of the column, ascend and pass beneath the olivary body, and leaving the surface of the deeply. «' ./ o medulla at the pons, incline backwards and inwards to the floor of the fourth ventricle (where they form the eminentia teres), in their course to the cerebrum.

This interweaving of the lumns" fibres occupies the anterior groove of the medulla oblongata, at the distance of three quarters of an inch from the pons.

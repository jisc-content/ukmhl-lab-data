THE LABYRINTH. 793 Branches. — One branch is arched forwards and down- one to wards, and enters the carotid canal to communicate with the pathetic^ sympathetic on the artery (p. 122.). A second is directed l^^^^xo upwards to join the large superficial petrosal nerve in thecal hiatus Fallopii (p. 150.). And the third filament has the and a' following course to reach the otic ganglion: it ascends otic gln- towards the upper surface of the petrous part of the temporal bone, passing in front of the fenestra ovalis but beneath the canal for the tensor tympani muscle, and near the gangliform enlargement on the facial nerve, to which it is connected by filaments (p. 153.). Beyond the union with the facial, this nerve is named small superficial petrosal, and is continued ^^^^^^j^ forwards external to the hiatus Fallopii, but without appear- petrosal, ing on the surface of the temporal bone, until it issues from the skull to end in the otic ganglion (p. 154.). Nerves to muscles.—The tensor tympani muscle is supplied f^^^^^ by a branch from the otic ganglion (p. 155.); the stapedius muscles, receives an offset from the facial trunk ; and the laxator tympani from the chorda tympani nerve (?). The chorda tympani is a branch of the facial nerve, and is chorda , tympani now seen in the part of its course through the tympanum, crosses Entering the cavity behind, it crosses the membrana tym- pani, and issues from the space by a special aperture internal to or in the Glasserian fissure, to join the gustatory nerve. Its farther course is described at page 98. The auricular branch of the vagus nerve, though not a Branch nerve of the tympanum, is an offset to the outer ear, and tothl"^ may be now traced in the softened bone. Arising in the ear. jugular fossa (p. 117.), the nerve enters a canal which con- ducts it across the lower end of the aqueduct of Fallopius, and through the substance of the temporal bone to the back of the pinna of the ear.

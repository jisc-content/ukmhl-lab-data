From the tuber cinereum a conical reddish tube, the infundibulum, descends to the pituitary body in the sella Turcica of the sphenoid bone. Anterior to this same mass (tuber cinereum), are the converging optic tracts with their commissure. Beneath the commissure of the optic nerves lies a thin grayish layer (lamina cinerea); and still farther forwards is the anterior part of the great longitudinal fissure between the hemispheres, with the white corpus callosum in the bottom of it. At the inner end of the fissure of Sylvius is another spot, perforated by vessels, and distinguished by the name substantia perforata, or locus perforatus anticus.

The several parts of the base of the brain are now to be noticed more in detail. Three Lobes of the cerebrum. â€” There are three lobes in each lach hemisphere, but this division into parts is confined to the sphere; uudcr surfacc. The anterior lobe is triangular in form, and anterior, the apex is tumcd backwards; it is somewhat excavated on the surface now seen, which, in the natural position of the brain, rests on the orbital plate of the frontal bone. The middle, olfactory nerve lies near the inner margin. The middlelohe is the most prominent of the three, and projected, before the brain was removed, into the middle fossa of the base of the skull. The fissure of Sylvius intervenes between it and the poste- anterior lobe. The posterior lobe has no fissure to separate it from the middle one ; its extent forwards is determined, as before said, by the anterior or outer margin of the cere- bellum. This lobe would not be in contact with the base of

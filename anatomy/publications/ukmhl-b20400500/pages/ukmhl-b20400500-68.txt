In the orhit, the nasal lies at first over the optic nerve, but beneath the superior rectus and levator palpebrae muscles, and afterwards below the superior oblique; in this part of Branch- its coursc it fumishcs the following branches: — es.

These lie es. on the inner side of the optic, and join the ciliary branches of the lenticular ganglion. T .

Before this branch leaves the orbit it receives an offset of commu- nication from the supra-trochlear nerve. ^j^g In the nose.

Lenticu- The OPHTHALMIC Or LENTICULAR GANGLION is a Small glior?."" roundish body, of the size of a pin's head, and of a reddish situa- colour. It is placed at the back of the orbit, between the optic nerve and the external rectus, and commonly on the Connec- outcr sidc of the ophthalmic artery. By its posterior part the tions. ganglion has branches of communication with other nerves (its roots); and from the anterior part proceed the ciliary struc. nerves to the eyeball. In the ganglion, sensory, motory, and sympathetic filaments are combined. Three T^l® offsets of communication are three in number. One, the long ' ^^^^ branch of the nasal nerve before noticed, which joins the superior angle. A second branch of considerable thick- short ^6ss {short root) passes from the inferior angle to join the branch of the third nerve that supplies the inferior oblique muscle. And

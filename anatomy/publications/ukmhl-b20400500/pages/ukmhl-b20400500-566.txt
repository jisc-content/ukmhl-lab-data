546 DISSECTION OP THE ABDOMEN. Parts Microscopic appearances, — The characters of the sub- with stance of the spleen and of the Malpighian bodies must be micro- .11 • n r» 1 scope, made out with the aid oi the microscope. Splenic The splenic pulp is a soft semi-fluid red-brown mass, stance; which fiUs the arcolas of the interspersed white trabecular colour, ^ and structure. Under the microscope this material is composed of very fine fibres and bloodvessels, with special cells, and small masses of blood undergoing transformation into pale nucleated cells (Kolliker). Cells of The special cells are united by a reddish-yellow fluid, and spleen- ^ j j 7 pulp. form the half of the pulpy substance: they are of diflerent sizes, apparently as if in diflerent stages of growth, the smallest being nucleus-like bodies, and the largest are pale one or two nucleated and. granular cells. Maipi- The Malpighian corpuscles are best seen in the human bodies; body after sudden death, or in children. They are small size; vesicular bodies, averaging -g^^th of an inch in diameter, and are appended, mostly without pedicles, to the sheaths of the smallest branches of the arteries ; they project into the pulp attach- of the splccu, and are surrounded by it except at the attached side. Each is a closed sac, having a membranous case, with contents. < consti- The coat of the corpuscle is transparent, and is said to consist of the same tissue as the sheaths of the small arteries with which it is continuous (Kolliker). In the interior is a tenacious whitish albuminous mass, with diflerent sized pale cells, being granular as well as nucleated, of the same nature as those in the spleen-pulp. Splenic Bloodvessels. — The branches of the splenic artery ^niet artery , , ^ the spleen, and their ramifications are surrounded by the supplies sheaths of tissue, even to the terminal twigs. The chief de?of' branches are said not to join together; and they accompany spleen. yeins till they havc a size from y^o^h to ^^^th of an inch. Then they leave the veins, and, still surrounded by sheaths, end in the smallest branches; these pass by the Malpighian bodies, supplying fine twigs to them which ramify in their interior, and then end by means of tufts of offsets in the Vein splenic pulp.

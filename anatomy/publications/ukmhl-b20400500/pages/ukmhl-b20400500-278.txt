It is strong- front, est near the subclavius muscle, where the costo-coracoid band is placed; and it receives below an accession from that same membrane. The anterior part of the tube is per- forated by the acromial thoracic artery and the anterior thoracic nerve. Dissec- Dissection, â€” The tube of fascia around the vessels will be costo- demonstrated by making a transverse cut in the costo-cora- lascia. coid membrane near the clavicle, so that the handle of the scalpel can be passed beneath it. By raising the lower border of the subclavius this muscle will be seen to be in- cased by fascia, which is attached to the bone both before and behind. Clean After the costo-coracoid membrane has been examined, the remains of it are to be taken away; and the upper part of the axillary vessels and nerves, with their branches, should be carefully cleaned. Subcla- The SUBCLAVIUS MUSCLE is thin and roundish in form, nluscie and is placed between the clavicle and the first rib. It arises by a tendon from the first rib, at the junction of the osseous and cartilaginous parts, and in front of thfe sat- costo-clavicular ligament. The fibres ascend obliquely, Jfavfcie" and are inserted into a groove on the under surface of the and first whicli rcachcs between the two tubercles (internal and external) for the attachment of the costo and coraco- clavicular ligaments.

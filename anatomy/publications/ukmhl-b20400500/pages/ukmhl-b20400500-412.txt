392 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. Receives Branches,— In the thorax the duct receives the lym- atics. phatics of the left half of the wall of the cavity, viz. from the sternal and intercostal glands; also, the lymphatics of the left lung, those of the left side of the heart, and those of the trachea and oesophagus. Right c. The right lymphatic duct, though not in the thorax, is mainly formed by the large branches received from the is in the visccra in that cavity. It is a short trunk at the lower part neck. of the neck, which is about half an inch in length, and opens into the angle of union of the subclavian and jugular veins of the same side (p. 76.). Its opening is guarded by valves. JeivGs Branches. — Into this trunk the lymphatics of the right atic?o'f ^PP^^ limb, and the right side of the head and neck pour and of^ contents. In addition, the lymphatics of the right side thorax chest, thosc of the right lung and the right side of the heart, and some from the right lobe of the liver, after passing through their respective glands, unite into a few large trunks that ascend beneath the innominate vein to reach the duct in the neck. Their Structure of the ducts. — The wall of these tubes resembles struc- ^ fin structure that of the bloodvessels : — it has an external like blood- stratum of areolar tissue ; an inner lininsr of thin nucleated vessels. ' o epithelium; and a middle coat formed chiefly of circular fibres like those in the bloodvessels. Thoracic CoRD OF THE SYMPATHETIC Nerve. — The thoracic part cord of , ^ sympa- of the gangliated cord of the sympathetic nerve lies on each side of the spinal column, and is placed over the heads of the has ribs and the intercostal vessels. The 2:an2flia on it are twelve ganglia, usually twclvc, One being opposite each dorsal nerve, but this number varies much : of these, the upper one is the largest; and the last two are rather anterior to the line of the others, being situate on the side of the bodies of the cor- responding vertebrge. In the chest the sympathetic nerve is and is covered by the pleura; and it is continuous above and below covered • i i by pieu- With the cord in the neck and the abdomen. ra.

LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRiE. 403 upper border, and somewhat to the outer surface of the other. On each side the ligament reaches from the articular process to the root of the spinous process. Between the first two vertebrae and the skull there are special fibrous ligaments in the corresponding situation (see p. 182.). c. Ligaments of the spines,—Along the tips of the spinous Those processes of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae is a longitudinal spines band of fibres, — the supraspinous ligament. It is thicker ^^^^}^^. in the lumbar than in the dorsal region of the spine, and is formed by superficial and deep fibres ; the former reaching over three or more spines, whilst the latter pass from bone to bone. It is closely united with the tendons of the muscles. The band called ligamentum nuchae, which is composed of fibrous tissue, takes its place in the neck. Along the spinal column there are also thin and somewhat and be- , . . tween membranous interspinous ligaments, which reach from the the n spines. root to the tip of the spinous processes. The strength of these bands is dependent upon the interval they have to fill; they are more marked in the lumbar than in the other vertebrae, but they are least strong in the cervical region. d. Ligaments of the transverse processes.— In the loins Those the intertransverse ligaments are thin membranous bands in trans- the intervals between the processes. In the dorsal vertebrae pro!^ they are round bundles of fibres. And in the neck the fibres exist only at the apex of the processes, or they may be wanting here and there. DD 2

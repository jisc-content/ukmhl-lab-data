The anterior ligament (ligamentum patellae) or the ment,or tendon of insertion of the extensor muscles of the leg, is about three inches long, and is narrower in the middle than tendon at the cuds. Superiorly, it is attached to the lower part of exten- the patella and the depression on the inner surface ; and, in- .sors. feriorly, it is inserted into the tubercle of the head of the tibia, and an inch of the bone below it. The expansion of the vasti covers it; and a bursa intervenes between it and the tubercle of the tibia (see p. 679.). Open the Dissectiou. — To see the reflections of the synovial mem-

118 DISSECTION OF THE NECK. at upper branches of the sympathetic. At the lower part of the neck, on and low- each side, there is a sinMe cardiac nerve: — that of the r'mht side er part i , i of neck, enters the chest, and joins one of the deep nerves to the heart from the sympathetic; and on the left side the corresponding nerve terminates in the superficial cardiac plexus of the thorax. Another 4. The inferior laryngeal or recurrent nerve of the right side tola- leaves the pneumo-gastric trunk opposite the subclavian artery, and winding round that vessel, takes an upward course in the ends neck to the larynx. To reach its destination, the nerve ascends des^in beneath the common carotid and inferior thyroid arteries, and interior. ^-^^^ between the trachea and the oesophagus. At the larynx it enters beneath the ala of the thyroid cartilage, and it will be afterwards traced into the interior. The following branches arise from it: — It has a. Some cardiac branches leave this nerve as it turns round the to heart J Subclavian artery; these enter the thorax, and join the cardiac nerves of the sympathetic, to tra- b. Muscular branches spring from the recurrent nerve whilst it and oeso- lies between the trachea and the oesophagus, and are distributed to phagus. -^^^-^ those tubes. Near the larynx also some filaments are fur- nished to the inferior constrictor muscle. Left re- 1^^*^ side of the body the recurrent nerve arises in nerve"^ the tliorax, opposite the arch of the aorta, around vrhich it bends. In the neck its position is between the trachea and the oesophagus, as on the right side. Spinal The SPINAL ACCESSORY NERVE passcs tlirough the foramen sory^ jugulare with the pneumo-gastric, but is not marked by any has two ganglion while in the foramen. This nerve is constructed of ^^^^^ two parts, viz. accessory to the vagus, and spinal, which have different origins and distributions. See Origin of the cranial nerves. g^^gg The part accessory to the vagus is the smaller of the two, tTgus^ finally blends with the vagus beyond the skull. In the in fora- foramcn of exit from the skull, it lies close to the vagus ; and here it joins the upper ganglion of that nerve by one or two filaments. Below Having passed through the foramen, this part is applied ^o^^- to the vaffus; it is then continued over the lower eranfflion men; o ' o o of that nerve, and blends with the trunk of the vagus only how beyond the ganglion. It gives offsets to join the pharyngeal and upper laryngeal branches of the vagus ; and according to Bendz, offsets from it may be traced into many other branches of the same nerve.

The vessels end in a network of capillaries on the exterior as well as in the termina- substance of the special layer, and this is most developed about the termination of the nerves. b. The branch to the cochlea subdivides into twii^s that andan- other to enter the canals in the modiolus. Small offsets from these the cochlea. are directed outwards through holes in the lamina spiralis, and communicate together in loops near the margin of that osseous zone, but in greatest number on that surface to- Mode of wards the tympanic scala. From this anastomosis vessels tf™^"^" are supplied to the membrane lining the scalag, and to the structure called cochlearis muscle. A capillary vessel (? venous) is placed longitudinally in the membranous part of the septum scalarum, and communicates here and there with the arterial loops before mentioned. The vein. — One branch of vein is derived from the vein to cochlea, and another from the membranous labyrinth: the It^lS'.^^ two are united near the cochlea, and the trunk ends in the superior petrosal sinus in the base of the skull. Nerve of the Labyrinth. — Only one special nerve, Audi- auditory, is distributed to the labyrinth (p. 198.). Entering ne7ve the internal auditory meatus, the nerve divides into two divides branches, like the artery, viz., an anterior for the cochlea, and a posterior for the membranous labyrinth. In the trunk and in both branches there are nerve cells contained: in the nerve to the labyrinth they form a reddish swelling, which was named intumescentia ganglioformis by Scarpa. a. The cochlear branch divides at the base of the medio- a coch- lear lus into twigs that enter the apertures in that body. These branch, small divisions of the nerve are directed outwards with the vessels in the canals in the lamina spiralis, but nearest the tympanic scala, where they form a plexiform arrangement, with lengthened interspaces and ganglion cells. At the whose edge of the bone the nerve tubules cease to divide, and reach ments end in a short distance into the membranous part of the septum the sep- ^ ^ turn, scalarum, where they are arranged in conical sets parallel with one another; but their mode of ending is not satisfac- torily made out. The nerve fibres do not lose the white retain- substance of Schwann at their termination, but retain it in white the minutest tubules (Bowman), stance. 3 F

Intraspinal Vessels. — The arteries in the interior of vessels of the the spinal canal supply the cord and its membranes, and the spinal bodies of the vertebras. The veins form a remarkable plexus within the canal, but this will not be seen unless the veins have been specially injected. The intraspinal arteries are derived from the vessels source . . . of the alonsr the sides and front of the spinal column, viz. from the intra- vertebral and ascending cervical, from the intercostal, and arteries., from the lumbar and lateral sacral; and are distributed after the following plan: — As each artery enters the spinal canal by the interver- Distri- *' ^ ^ bution to tebral foramen, it divides into two branches, upper and the ver- lower : these branches are directed, one upwards and the and the other downwards, behind the bodies of the two contiguous vertebrae but outside the edge of the posterior common ligament, and join in anastomotic loops with offsets of the intraspinal artery above and below. These loops extend from one intervertebral foramen to another, and furnish branches to the periosteum, and the bodies of the vertebrae on their posterior surface, as well as anastomotic twigs to connect the arches across the vertebrae. Besides forming loops, the intraspinal vessels produce a central longitudinal artery, like that on the front of the spinal cord; this vessel lies on the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebrae^ and is reinforced at intervals by offsets from the loops. The intraspinal veins consist of two anterior longitudinal veins vessels, which extend the whole length of the spinal canal the behind the bodies of the vertebrae ; of veins from the bodies canai are of the vertebrae; and of a plexus of veins beneath the neural arches of the vertebrae. a. The anterior longitudinal veins are close to the bodies of the Anterior

At its centre it is thick and strong, and is attached to the con- tiguous margins of the cartilages from which it is named ; but on the sides the ligament is thin, and leaving the lower border of the thyroid cartilage is continued upwards into the chorda vocalis. Some small apertures exist in this membrane for the passage of small arteries into the larynx. The ligament is partly concealed by the crico-thyroid muscle. and 3 The lateral crico-thyroid^ or capsular ligament, surrounds joint, the articular surfaces between the side of the cricoid and the lower cornu of the thyroid cartilage. Its fibres are strongest behind. A synovial membrane lines the capsule.

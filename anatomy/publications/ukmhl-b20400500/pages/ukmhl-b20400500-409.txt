(ESOPHAGUS. 389 left azjgos veins; some oesophageal, mediastinal, and verte- bral veins, and the right bronchial vein. The left lower or smaller azygos vein (inferior) begins in smaii, or the abdomen, in the lumbar veins of the left side of the lower, vertebral column. Having entered the thorax along with ^egjnsin the aorta, or through the crus of the diaphragm, the vein men, ascends on the left of the aorta as high as the seventh or eisrhth dorsal vertebra, and then crosses beneath that vessel ends in ^ ^ , larger and the thoracic duct to end in the larger or right vein, azygos. It receives the four or five lower intercostal veins of the left Branch- side, and some oesophageal and mediastinal veins. Most commonly there is a left upper azjgos vein (M. j^JJ^^her Breschet), which is formed bj offsets from the spaces be- azygos tween the superior intercostal vein and the highest branch (upper), of the left lower azjgos. Receiving three or four branches, the trunk either joins the lower azjgos of its own side, or crosses the spine to open separatelj into the right vein. The GESOPHAGUS is a hollow muscular tube which extends geso- from the pharjnx to the stomach. The cervical part of the fs^^pf"uy tube has been described at page 128., and the thoracic part ^""^^^ is now to be examined. Entering the thorax rather to the left of the middle line, and the gullet is directed inwards beneath the arch of the aorta, ^" and reaches the middle of the spine about the fourth or fifth where it dorsal vertebra. From that spot it is continued through the y^s in ^ Â° front of greater part of the interpleural space on the right of the ^^^^^ aorta, and superficial to the other contiguous bodies; but at ^^^^^^ the lower part of the thorax, it is again inclined to the left, a'll?"^^ over the aorta, to gain the oesophageal opening of the dia- p^^'^^s'^- phragm. As far as the arch of the aorta the oesophagus parts lies beneath the trachea, though it is inclined somewhat to S^^'J^^^^'^^ the left of the air tube: but bejond the arch it is crossed by the left bronchus, and is concealed bj the pericardium, down to the diaphragm. In this extent the tube is covered on the on the sides bj the pleurae, and lies, below the arch, on the right of the aorta. At the upper part of the thorax the oesophagus and be- will be found to rest on the longus colli muscle and the ver- tebrse; but below the arch of the aorta it is separated from the spine bj the intercostal vessels, and lastlj it lies on the aorta. Below the situation of the bronchus the pneumo- gastric nerves surround the oesophagus with their branches,

658 DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. lympha- surfacG of the lower limb ; whilst the upper or transverse set are joined by the lymphatics of the penis, and by those of the lower part of the abdomen and the buttocks. The glands vary much in number and size, and not unfrequently those by the side of the vein are united together. Raise Dissection.— The deeper layer of the superficial fascia is stratum to be detached from the subjacent fascia lata, by means of super^- incisions similar to those for reflecting the subcutaneous fascia. Stratum, except that the lower cut across the thigh is not to be made so far down. The handle of the scalpel is to be employed in the separation, and the dissector is to endeavour to avoid cutting the nerves and vessels. Internal to the saphenous vein a thin membrane can be easily raised, but external to that vessel there scarcely exists a continuous layer distinct from the fascia lata. In reflecting the stratum the margin of an aperture (saphenous) in the fascia lata will be apparent. Deep The deeper layer of the superficial fascia is a very thin thrsu- membraniform stratum, which is most evident near Poupart's fasd?^^ ligament, and on the inner side of the saphenous vein. About one inch below the ligament it conceals the large saphenous opening in the fascia lata, and is there pierced by the saphenous vein with some of the ducts of the lymphatic covers fflauds. As it stretches across the opening it is connected 8aphe- ^ , . - . 11 T 1 . . nous to the circumierence,—internally by loose connective tissue, opening, externally by firm fibrous bands ; and it is connected also with the loose crural sheath of the subjacent vessels in that aperture. The part of this stratum over the saphe- nous opening is perforated by many small apertures for the transmission of the ducts of the glands, and has been named PaH; cribriform fascia from its sieve-like appearance. In a cribrl^ hernial protrusion through that opening the cribriform por- Ssda ^^^^ projected forwards by the gut, and forms one of the coverings.

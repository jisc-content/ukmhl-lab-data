The left coronary branch is inclined behind the pul- artery?^ monary artery to the left side of that vessel, then in the groove between the left auricle and ventricle to the back of the heart, where it anastomoses with the right coronary branch. Like the preceding artery, it furnishes offsets to the substance of the auricle and ventricle. The largest of these descends in the anterior sulcus, over the partition of the ventricles, towards the apex of the heart, and communi- cates with the descending branch of the right coronary artery at the back of the heart. Wins of rpj^g veins of the substance of the heart (cardiac) are not heart. same in number, nor have they the same distribution as the arteries. There may be said to be three sets, but for the most part they are united into one large trunk, the coro- nary sinus, which opens into the right auricle. The coronary sinus will be seen on raising the heart to be ^"^"^' apparently the dilated ending of the great coronary vein. The points in its anatomy will be better seen if it is opened extent; with a scissors. About an inch usually in extent, it is limited on the one side by two valves that exist at the opening of the great coronary vein into it, and on the other by another valve (Thebesian), where it opens into the right struc- auricle. It is crossed by the muscular fibres of the left auricle. Inferiorly and on the right it receives some branches from the back of the ventricles, whose openings are guarded by valves; and nearly at its outer termination is another joining. Yem without a valve,—the oblique vein of Mr. Marshall, that ascends along the back of the left auricle. Large u.

It receives collateral branches in its course, and its ending in the sinus is marked by two valves. Small b.

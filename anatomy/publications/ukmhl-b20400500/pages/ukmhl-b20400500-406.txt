386 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. Thora- The THORACIC AORTA is the part of the ffreat systemic cic aorta. ^ ^ ^ o Extent, vessel, which is above the diaphragm. Its extent is from the lower border of the third dorsal vertebra (the left side), where the arch ceases, to the front of the last dorsal ver- ourse, tebra. Contained in the interpleural space in front of the spine, the vessel is rather arched in its course, lying at its upper part on the left, but at its lower part on the front of the spinal column; beneath it are the vertebrae and the smaller azygos vein. In front of the vessel is the root of and con- i}^q j^ft lunff with the pericardium. On the left side it is nections. ^ ^ ^ covered by the pleura in all its length; and on the right side are the oesophagus and the thoracic duct, but near the dia- phragm the former is placed over the aorta. Branch- The branches of the vessel are distributed to the sur- rounding parts, and are named from their destination, viz. bronchial, pericardial, oesophageal, mediastinal, and inter- costal. Arteries 1. The hroficMal arteries supply the structure of the lung. lungs, and arise from the front of the aorta, but their num- Distri- ber and place of origin are liable to vary. These vessels adhere to the posterior part of the bronchial tubes, and so enter the interior of the lung, in which they ramify (p. 385.); they give some twigs to the bronchial glands and the oeso- phagus. One The artery of the right lung arises either in common with one of the left bronchial arteries (superior), or from the first intercostal artery of the right side. two left. For the left lung there are two arteries (superior and in- ferior), that arise from the aorta at a distance from each other. Vein of Bronchial veins. — One vein issues from the root of each the lung, j^^g^ gj^^ following manner: — the right one joins the larger azygos vein; and the left ends in the superior intercostal vein of its own side.

Ramifying in the ^* structure of the gullet, these vessels anastomose with one another; above, they communicate with branches of the

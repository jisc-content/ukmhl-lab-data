449 ANTERIOR HALF OF THE PERINJEAL SPACE. ANTERIOR HALF OF THE PERINEAL SPACE. In the anterior part of the perineal space the tube of the contents urethra is lodged, as this passes from the interior of the pelvis to the surface of the body. Placed about midway ^^^J^- between the bones, the tube is supported by a fibrous s^tion of structure named the triangular ligament. Muscles are col- lected around it, to aid in the expulsion of the urine : some of these are before, and some within the triangular ligament before alluded to. The vessels and nerve lie, as in the posterior half, along the outer side, and send inwards offsets. Supporting the anterior part of the urethra is the penis: this body and its muscles and vessels have to be examined generally with the other contents of this half of the peri- naeal space.

Each side is to be inflated to demonstrate the fact that a partition exists in the middle line : at the same time, it will be evident that there is another partition between the perinasal space and the thigh, for the air does not pass along the limb. The student is next to cut through the superficial fascia on the left side, from the scrotum to the ischio-rectal fossa, and to remove some loose and fatty tissue, to bring into view the line of attachment of that fascia to the bones externally, and to the triangular liga- ment posteriorly : the septum along the middle line should also be defined.

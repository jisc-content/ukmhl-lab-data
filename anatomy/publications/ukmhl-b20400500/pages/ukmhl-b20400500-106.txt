The trunk of the artery gives offsets to the surrounding parts, viz.: — branch- a. Parotid branches are furnished to the gland which conceals parotid, the artery.

The transverse facial branch quits the temporal artery oppo- *° site the condyle of the jaw, and is directed forwards over the mas- seter muscle (p. 30.); on the side of the face it supplies the muscles and the integuments, and anastomoses with the facial artery. Branch The middle temporal branch arises just above the zygoma, and porar* pierces the temporal aponeurosis to enter the substance of the muscle temporal muscle.

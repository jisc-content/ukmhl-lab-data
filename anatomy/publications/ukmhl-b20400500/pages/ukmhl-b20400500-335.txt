MUSCLES OF THE THUMB. 315 dons tlie student should endeavour to preserve two small nerves that enter the two inner lumbrical muscles. The dissection of the short muscles of the ball of the and lutie thumb and of the little finger is next to be prepared. Some care is necessary to make a satisfactory separation of the different small muscles of the thumb: those of the little finger are more easily defined. Short muscles of the thumb.—These are four in num- Four ber, and are named from their action on the thumb. The in the most superficial is the abductor pollicis; beneath it is the the ° opponens pollicis, which will be recognised by its attachment viz. to the whole length of the metacarpal bone. To the inner side of the last is the short flexor; and the wide muscle coming from the third metacarpal bone is the adductor of the thumb. The ABDUCTOR POLLICIS is thin, about an inch wide, and Abduc- is superficial to the rest. It arises from the upper part of the annular ligament at the radial side, and from the ridge of the OS trapezium; and is inserted into the outer part of Attach- ments. the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. The muscle is jg ^he subcutaneous, and rests on the opponens pollicis : it is often- ^ertfeiaV. times connected at its origin with a slip from the tendon of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. Dissection. — The opponens pollicis will be seen on cutting Dissec- through the abductor. To separate this muscle from the short flexor on the inner side, the student should begin near the farther end of the metacarpal bone, where there is usually a slight interval. The OPPONENS POLLICIS arises from the lower part of the Oppo. annular ligament beneath the preceding, and from the osedtome- trapezium and its ridge; it is inserted into the front and the bone, outer border of the metacarpal bone for the whole length. This muscle is partly concealed by the preceding, though it is larger and projects on each side. Along its inner border beneath is the flexor brevis pollicis. An insertion into the external sesamoid bone is described by M. Theile. The FLEXOR BREVIS POLLICIS is the largest of the short piexor muscles of the thumb : it consists of two parts (inner and outer) at the insertion, but these are partly united at the origin. The outer head, the smallest, arises partly be- arises by neath the opponenti from about the two outer thirds of heads.

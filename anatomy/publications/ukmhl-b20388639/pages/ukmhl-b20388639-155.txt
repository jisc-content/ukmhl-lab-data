ABSORPTION. 105 surface and others deep seated in the muscles and other organs. They do not branch out into smaller and smaller vessels like the arteries, but maintain the same size through- out ; varying however in difFerents parts of the body. They are provided with little valves in their interior, like the veins and lacteals, and seem to possess a contractile power to propel their contents onwards. Like the lacteals they also pass through small roundish bodies in their course, called the lymphatic glands; and they likewise empty their contents by different branches into the thoracic duct. The substance absorbed by the lymphatic vessels is a thickish transparent kind of fluid, called Ipyiph ; highly nu- tritious in its nature, and, in its progress through the lym- phatic glands, it becomes more and more of the nature of blood as it approximates towards the thoracic duct; where it mixes with the elaborated chyle. The disintegrated, and waste, particles of the body are absorbed by the lymphatic vessels before the new nutritious particles are deposited by the arterial capillaries; thus form- ing as it were the moulds of the different tissues. It is supposed that during the growth of the body a lar- ger portion of the nutritious particles are deposited, in all its tissues, than are taken up by the absorbent vessels. That when the body is full grown, and in a state of health, the new nutritious particles are about equal to the worn out portions absorbed. That in sickness, or when the body is wasting, a greater portion of the waste particles are absorbed then are replaced by new nutritious particles; the different functions being weakened and not able to provide them. But in addition to these special organs of the absorbent system, there are other parts of the body more or less absorbent in their nature.

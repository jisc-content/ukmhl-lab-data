140 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. which means the large vessels become overgorged, and the general circulation impeded. The lungs, the especial organs for removing carbona- ceous matter from the blood, and for supplying it with oxygen, have their respiratory power also diminished by the paralyzing effect of the alcohol on the nerves of respiration ; at the very time too when their increased action is rather required to free the blood from its extra impurities. The brain and nervous system also, instead of being healthfully stimulated by good blood, are irritated, inflamed, and hardened by the alcohoKzed poisoned blood, and their natural functions consequently impaired. The muscular fibre likewise, not having its supply of nutritious blood, becomes flaccid and feeble ; and the nerves of motion, no longer under the control of the will, cause the whole muscles of the body to give way, and contract spasmodically, as the staggering drunkard reels on in his course. Such being the immediate effects of intoxicating drink, it may readily be supposed that this general derangement of the whole system cannot often take place without disease being induced. It may be useful, therefore, to trace its morbid effects on different organs, and the diseases which persons indulging in the use of those drinks are particularly subject to. The effects of alcohol on the stomach is first to irritate its mucous lining, and over-excite its nerves and secretory vessels, so as to create a morbid appetite for food beyond the wants of the system; causing the bloated and inffamed ap- pearance we see in many persons. If the stimulant is con- tinued, inflammatory patches and ulcerous spots break out in the interior of the stomach, accompanied by a vitiated

^5 IIESPIRATION. the chest, and the diaphragm, or the muscular partition which separates the chest from the abdomen. The organs having been described, the following is the manner in which the air is taken into and expelled from the lungs; by which element the purification of the blood, and the develoj)ment of animal heat, are effected. The cavity of the chest is enlarged, for a fresh inspira- tion of air, by the ribs being drawn upwards and extended forwards through the contractions of the muscles belong- ing to them; while, at the same time, the contraction of the diaphragm forces it downwards on the abdomen. The lungs at the same moment expanding by their elasticity, and the air rushing into them, they being no longer com- pressed, every part of them is filled. At the same moment that the vesicles of the lungs are thus filled with air, a stream of dark venous blood is dis- tributed over their surface by the minute branches of the pulmonary artery. The oxygen of the air contained in the vesicles, penetrating through the delicate membrane of which they are composed, comes in contact with the blood contained in the arterial capillaries which are spread over their surface; and instantly changes it from a dark purple to a bright scarlet. The air is expired, or expelled, from the lungs, chiefly by the relaxation of the muscles of the chest enabling the ribs to descend and fall in, while the contraction of the abdominal muscles helps to pull them downwards, at the same time causing the contents of the abdomen to push the diaphragm upwards. The cavity being thus diminished, and the lungs compressed, a portion of air is forced out of the air vesicles, while, at the same moment, the stream of purified blood is sent back to the left auricle of the heart.

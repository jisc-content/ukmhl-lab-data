HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 118 eye; where, crossing each other, they diverge to form a small reversed picture of the object upon the retina. This re- versed picture, in its transmission to the brain, is supposed to be rectified by some mental experience, so that we see the object erect instead of reversed. To add to the efficiency of the eye as an instrument of sight, the power of moving it in all directions is afforded by means of six small muscles; four^ of them to move it upwards, downwards, inwards, and outwards, and two^ others to roll round it in its socket. To shield and protect so delicate a structure from in- jury, we find many wonderful contrivances provided. We find it set in a strong bony cavity, the interior of which is lined with a soft fatty substance on w^hich it moves. We see that the eye-brows above form a hairy embank- ment, to ward off the sweat of the brow. That the, eye- lids form a divided curtain, shutting with the rapidity of thought on approaching danger, while their lashes, by their fanning movements, prevent the intrusion of annoying par- ticles. But, should dust chance to enter, the lachrymal^ gland instantly sends down the flow of tears to wash out the impurity; the tears being the fluid which on other occasions keep the eye constantly bright and clear. We perceive also the pupil instantly closed to exclude an excess of light, and to expand when more is needed. And finally at night, when rest is required for so active an organ. ^ The Eectus superior, ^ ^\^^ Obliquus superior, or Tro- The Rectus inferior, chlearis, andâ€” The Eectus internus, The Obliquus inferior.

66 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. organs of touch. These may be seen at the points of the fingers, when the sense of touch is greatly excited, pushing out the cuticle in the form of minute protuberances. They may likewise be seen, in a greatly depressed form, in what is called "goose-flesh," when the skin is chilled by sudden cold. Throughout the cutis are also placed innumerable little glands for secreting, from the blood, the various matters that are passed off* through the pores of the skin by visible and invisible perspiration. Also the minute glands^ that secrete the oily fluid for lubricating and softening the skin, as well as the vessels connected with the absorbents. The bulbs or roots of the hair are also situated in the skin, each hair being a horny tube containing a soft medullary fluid, varying in colour in different individuals. To the skin, as a lohole, then, belong the following important functions. 1st. It is an organ of the sense of touch; those parts of the body most sensitive being the hands, fingers, tongue, and lips. This sense is effected by means of the extreme branches of the nerves of feeling, which, rising up from the surface of the true skin, in little loop-like filaments, form minute protuberances under the cuticle, called nervous papillce, or little paps, every one of which is nourished and stimulated by branches of the blood-vessels. 2nd. It is an organ of secretion; as it secretes or separates from the blood the waste or noxious fluid called perspiration or sweat; as also the oily fluid for softening the skin. 3rd. It is an organ of excretion; as it passes off the perspiration through the outward pores, by means of small ' The sebaceous glands.

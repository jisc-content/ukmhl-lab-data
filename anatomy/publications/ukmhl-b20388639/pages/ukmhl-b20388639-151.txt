As the substances secreted are various, so are also the different organs by which they are formed; some of them being very simple in their structure, and others exceedingly complicated; some of them distributed throughout the body, as the follicles and glands of the skin, and others confined to particular localities, as the liver, pancreas, kidneys, &c. The simplest form of a secretory organ is seen in the different membranes of the body. That which is called serous membrane, such as lines the cavity of the chest and abdomen, and envelopes the organs contained in them, secretes or transudes a serous kind of fluid, by means of the capillary vessels which course through them. That which is called mucous membrane, such as lines the mouth, stomach, lungs, and other internal passages, secretes a mucous fluid, by means of minute secretory cells or fol-

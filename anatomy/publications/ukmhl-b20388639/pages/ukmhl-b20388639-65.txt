25 THE BLOOD ITS CIRCULATION. LESSON IX THE BLOODâ€”ITS CIRCULATION. The BLOOD is the material out of which the different parts of the body are formed, and by which they are nourished and sustained. In the human body arterial blood is of a bright scarlet colour, and venous blood of a dark purple; in some animals however it is otherwise. The blood, seen through a microscope, appears to be red flattish globules floating in a watery fluid. The quantity in an adult person is estimated to be from twenty-four to twenty-eight pounds. The blood is circulated through the body by the alternate contractions of the heart; that is its different compartments squeeze or force the blood from one into the other in succes- sion. They send out about two ounces at each contraction, amounting to many hogsheads daily. When the venous, or impure blood is brought back to the heart it is emptied by two large vessels, called the vena cava, into the right auricle. The auricle immediately contracting upon the blood forces it down through a small valve,^ into the right ventricle, which also contracting in its turn forces it out through the pulmonary artery into the lungs^ to be purified. When the blood is purified in the lungs it is conveyed ^ The Tricuspid valve. ^ Described in the next lesson.

68 HUMAN ANATOMT AND PHYSIOLOGY. must necessarily be thrown upon other organs, such as the kidneys, bowels, and lungs, by which means inflammation or other disease of those organs frequently occurs. But if these organs are in any way debilitated, so as to be incom- petent to the task of performing double labour, the noxious substances must be retained in the system, and so produce disease. The skin being also an active absorbent, readily takes into the circulation, under certain conditions of temperament, any noxious ingredient left on the surface of the body; as well as any impure vapour, or poisonous gases, by which it may be surrounded. The skin, being likewise an or^an of touch, is very liable to suffer by exposure to damp and cold; as the blood is thereby driven from the surface of the body to overpress and injure the internal organization. It also suffers from the want of proper exercise and warm clothing, as well as from every cause which prevents or checks the requisite supply of blood for nourishing and stimulating the millions of nervous papillae that are spread out over its surface. Such being the principal functions of the skin, they convey to us important lessons; teaching us the great necessity that exists for keeping its surface free from all impurities, by personal cleanliness and frequent bathing— for stimulating and keeping its numerous blood-vessels in healthy circulation, by proper exercise and the daily use of the flesh-brush or coarse towel—for keeping its delicate nerves, glands, and vessels protected from cold and damp, by warm and comfortable clothing—and for living in a dry, light, well-ventilated dwelling, with an ample supply of water for all the purposes of cleanliness and health.

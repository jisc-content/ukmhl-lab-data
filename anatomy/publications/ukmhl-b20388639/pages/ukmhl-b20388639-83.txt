4i THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM. LESSON XV. THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM. The BRAIN and the nerves connected with it are the organs of our sensations, thoughts, wishes, and will. The brain is an oval-shaped medullary^ body, filling up the cavity of the skull. It is secured in its place by means of a tough membrane called the dura mater, beneath which are two other coverings.^ It is divided, by folds of the dura mater, into two side portions or hemispheres,^ and into an upper and lower por- tion ; the upper and larger portion is called the cerebrum, and the lower and smaller portion the cerebellum. The large branch of the nerves, connected with the brain, and enclosed in the cavity of the back-bone, is called the spinal cord,^ the upper expanded portion of which is called the medulla oblongata. The nerves that branch out from each side of the brain and spinal cord, to different parts of the body, are soft white fibrous cords, formed of a number of exceedingly small tubes, said to contain a nervous fluid. There are nine pair of nerves proceeding from the head, and thirty-one pair from the spinal cord. The nerves which convey knowledge to the brain, through ^ Medullary, a soft brain-like substance. ^ Called the arachnoid membrane^ and the pia mater. ^ Hemisphere, half of a sphere, or globe. ^- Spinal cord, contained in the spinal column.

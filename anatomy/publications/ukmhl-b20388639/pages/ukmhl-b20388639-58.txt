20 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. which being gradually mixed with the digested food produce on it a peculiar change. This change, which seems to be of a chemical nature, is the complete separation of the nutritious from the innutri- tions portion of the food, the nutritious being a milky white rich fluid called chyle. The two substances being thus changed pass into the small intestines together, in the interior of which are the lacteals, minute vessels which gradually absorb^ the chyle in its outward course ; while the innutritions portion is grad- ually carried onwards to its receptacle, the large intestines. The lacteals coursing their way through the coatings of the small intestines finally pass outwards, and having ab- sorbed the chyle convey it onwards to the mesenteric glands. The chyle in passing through two sets of these glands is enriched and purified, and becomes more and more of the nature of blood. From the mesenteric glands it is conveyed into the thoracic duct, by which it is carried upwards and emptied into the venous^ blood. 5 Absorb, to suck up. Â® Venous, a dark impure kind of blood.

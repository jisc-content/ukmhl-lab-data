89 THE BLOOD ITS CIRCULATION. LESSON VIII. THE BLOODâ€”ITS CIRCULATION. The Blood is the vital fluid out of which all the different parts of our bodies are formed; whether they be the solid bone, muscle, brain or membrane; or the fluid milk, bile, or gastric juice. Pure blood is also the sustaining principle of life; for when the heart ceases to send its vital stream for building up and nourishing the different parts of our bodies, for stimulating its various organs, and for taking away waste and noxious particles, our senses immediately fail us, our muscles relax, and the whole of our delicate mechanism speedily stands still. The quantity of blood in a healthy adult person is es- timated to be about twenty-eight pounds, which is propelled by the heart so as to complete the circulation of the body in about two minutes and a half. From which rapidity of circulation it has been calculated that about an hogshead of blood must pass through the heart every hour. Seen by the unassisted eye, arterial or pure blood is of a bright scarlet colour ; while venouSy or impure blood is of a dark purple; but when examined by the aid of a micro- scope, circulating in the living vessels, it is found to consist of minute red particles floating in a colourless fluid. Those particles in the human species are in the form of flattened globules, of equal sizes, and about the three thou, sandth part of an inch in diameter. In some species of animals, however, the globules oft he blood are elliptical.

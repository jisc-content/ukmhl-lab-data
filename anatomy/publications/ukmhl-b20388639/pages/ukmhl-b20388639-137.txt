87 THE HEART AND BLOOD-VESSELS. other smaller ones proceed; from them again still smaller and smaller ones, like the branches of a tree ; till at last they terminate in the minutest branches, called the arterial capillaries, which are distributed throughout the muscles and organs of the body in a complete network of vessels. In the arterial capillaries the blood parts with its nourish- ing properties, and begins to course its way back to the heart, gathering up in its way all the waste and noxious particles it meets with. It comes back to the heart, however, in an inverse order to that by which it passed out. It first enters the extreme ends of the veins, which are called the venous capillaries; and these, in its way back, convey it into larger and larger veins; till at last it is emptied, by two large venous trunks, into the right auricle of the heart. These two large trunks are called the superior and INFERIOR VENA CAV^ ; the former bringing back the blood from the upper part of the body, and the latter from the lower; excepting that the veins belonging to the different organs contained in the abdomen pour their contents into one large trunk, called the vena porta, which, again dividing into branches, distributes the blood throughout the liver in its way back to the heart. The chief branches of the veins are distributed through the body in a similar manner to the arteries; the greater number of them side by side with the arteries, and many of them enclosed in the same sheath. The veins are, however, larger and more numerous than the arteries, there being in the legs and arms generally two veins to one artery. The arteries which convey the blood to the brain, being the two internal carotid and two vertebral branches, are tortuous or winding in their course; as if to check the

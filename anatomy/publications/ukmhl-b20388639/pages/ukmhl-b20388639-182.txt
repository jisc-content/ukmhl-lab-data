The digestibility of meat also greatly depends on the cooking of it; for when it is overdone its fibre is hardened, and much of its nutriment wasted, and when underdone its dense texture renders it less digestible. Fish, though less nourishing than meat, forms a most valuable article of diet when eaten fresh; but the oleaginous kinds, when salted, require strong stomachs to digest them. Shell-fish also, though exceedingly nutritious, is not easily digested. Bread, which is justly regarded as the staff of life, should be made of good flour, care be taken that it be nei- ther too fine nor too coarse ; it should never be rendered sour by fermentation, should always be well baked, and should never be eaten new, nor when it has become mouldy; and these cautions equally apply whether it be made of wheat, barley, rye, oats, or a mixture of different kinds of flour. Most kinds of puddings, pastry, and rich calces, are ren- dered indigestible by the butter, fat and other ingredients combined in them; and should always be avoided by per- sons of weak digestion. Fruits, when fnlly ripe, are cooling and nutritious, but should be sparingly taken after meals, as they are extremely hable to ferment the contents of the stomach; care should also be taken against swallowing the skins, stones, seeds and husks, as they are often productive of disease. As regards potatoes, carrots, turnips, peas, beans, and most of our esculent roots and herbs, they are all, when well cooked, excellent additions to the dinner table, but hard

THE ORGANS OF SENSE. 119 the eyelids close and shield it; and when shut lest, they should adhere too closely, we find minute glands,^ in their edges, secreting a soft fluid, to oil and facilitate their opening in the morning. The organ of the sensation of smell is the nose. The particles of all odorous bodies being carried, by the air, into its cavities fall upon their membraneous lining ; in which the filaments of the olfactory nerves are expanded. The external portion of the nose is formed of bone above and cartilage below, divided by a bony and cartilagi- nous partition into two equal compartments called the nostrils; the whole covered vrith the muscles, and enveloped in a thick integument. The cavities of the nostrils extend backwards to the pharynx ; their interior being divided from back to front into several passages, over which is spread out a thick spongy membrane, called the pituitary membrane. It is on the extended surface of this membrane that the nerves of smell are distributed, their minute filaments being kept moist by a fluid which it secretes. The chief organ of taste is the tongue ; on the surface of which are spread out the filaments of the gustatory, nerve, or nerve of taste, it being a branch of the fifth pair of nerves; two others also give it sensation and motion. The tongue is composed of six muscles, the fibres of which are interlaced in various directions, and between which a portion of fat is deposited; four muscles direct its movements. It is abundantly provided with blood vessels, is enveloped in a tough mucous membrane, and is connected * The Meibomian glands.

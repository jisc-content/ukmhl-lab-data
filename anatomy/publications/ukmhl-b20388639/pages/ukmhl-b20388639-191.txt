The bowels are not only affected by this inflamed and dis- eased state of the stomach, but they are otherwise injured;— first by the alcohol weakening the fibres of the pylorus it permits the undigested food to pass out and irritate them;— secondly by its coagulating and fermenting the food in the stomach it also tends to disorder them;—thirdly by its rendering the bile less alkaline it ceases to be a proper sti- mulant for promoting the healthy action of the bowels, which leads to a costive habit of body, and that state too fre- quently to other diseases.

34 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. LESSON XII. SECRETION. Secretion is one of those curious operations of nature by which different substances, required for various purposes in the body, are formed out of one fluid, the blood ; such as the saUva, gastric juice, bile, pancreatic juice, and many others. The materials of all those different substances being che- mically combined in the blood, secretion is the process by which each substance is elaborated^ and prepared, each by its appropriate^ organ, for the particular purpose required. The organs of secretion are various in their structure; some being comparatively simple, and others exceedingly complicated.^ Some of them are confined to a particular locahty, as the liver, pancreas, and kidneys; and others are distributed throughout the body, as the glands of the skin, and those of the internal organs. The simplest form of a secretory gland is seen in the setaceous follicles of the skin. These are minute bag-like bodies, having their mouths outwards, in which is secreted the oily fluid for keeping the skin soft. On the outside of these little bags, or follicles, are spread out the capillary branches of the blood-vessels, and filaments^ of the nerves. It is supposed that secretion is effected by the * Elaborated, heightened and improved.

But, necessary and beneficial as exercise is to the system, mental and hodily over-exertion are to be guarded against as highly debilitating and injurious. When the muscles are over-exercised they become irri- tated and inflamed, and the nerves sympathizing with them produce a general lassitude of the whole body.

HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 154 stances, and the open, stagnant, putrid drainage, and filthy habits of crowded populations; scourges which improve- ments in cultivation, draining, and cleanliness can alone banish from the world. Most of the epidemics of fevers, agues, cholera, and dysentery, that still afflict us, are to be traced to the same deteriorating cause, an impure atmosphere; ague being still prevalent in damp marshy districts, and typhus, cholera, and other diseases are constant visitors in the undrained, filthy, and crowded courts of our large cities. But numerous as are the annual victims of these dread- ful diseases, they are comparatively few to the vast numbers who are annually sacrificed by various diseases generated by the impure air of their shops and factories; and the dete- riorated atmosphere and imperfect ventilation of their own dwellings. Though it is not so much from the noxious particles, fumes, and exhalations that arise from many of the sub- stances used in our manufactures that disease is generated, as it is from the want of a free ventilation in our workshops, to dissipate them; and from the absence of care and cleanli- ness in the work-people themselves. Eor, apart from these noxious influences, the condensed and vitiated effluvia from their own lungs is in itself the deadliest of poisons; and if there is not always a constant supply of fresh air to purify their blood as it is sent to the lungs, the poison must remain in the system, to the gradual injury of their healths, or the speedy destruction of their lives. A poor and insufficient diet is also the cause of a great number of scrofulous, consumptive, nervous, and other diseases. In children, and young growing people especially, if they

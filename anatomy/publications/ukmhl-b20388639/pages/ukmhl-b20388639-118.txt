HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 70 The TRUNK is divided into two compartments, an upper and a lower, by means of a thin muscle called the diaphragm; this is attached to the end of the breast-bone, the lower ribs, and lumbar-bones, in such a manner as to partially move up and down in the process of respiration. The upper compartment, or portion above this partition, is called the thorax, or chest; and the lower compartment the abdomen, or belly. The THORAX contains the lungs, and lower portion of the tube which supplies them with air; also the heart, and the large branches of the arteries and veins connected with it. The lungs, or organs of respiration, are two spongy bodies, situated one on each side of the chest, with the heart between them. They extend in length from about the first rib to the diaphragm, on which they rest. They partake of the conical form of the interior, and with the heart and vessels fill up the cavity. Nearly half way down the chest the trachea is separated into two branches, called the hronclii; one branch entering the right lung, and the other the left. A thin, smooth, white, serous membrane, called the pleura, lines the interior of the chest, A portion of it is brought round each lung, so as to envelope it, and lie upon it as a bag. This membraneous envelope also secretes into itself a fluid for keeping its inner surface soft and pliable. The heart, or chief organ of circulation, is a strong, hollow, muscular body, of a conical form, having its base above. In an adult person it is about five and-a-half inches in height, and about three and-a-half-inches in breadth at the base; its interior being divided into four different com- partments, called auricles and ventricles. The heart is enclosed in a loose membraneous bag, called pericardium.

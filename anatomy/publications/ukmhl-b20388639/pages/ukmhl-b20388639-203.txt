DISEASE. 153 vessels; causing, at first, the blood to be propelled through them with force and difficulty, and occasioning the serous, or watery, portion of it to force its way through the sides of the vessels into the surrounding tissues. The vessels becoming weakened by this increased action, and the character of the blood altered by being deprived of some of its essential properties, it will no longer penetrate the minute vessels; its circulation will be thus gradually im- peded, and finally it will congest and stagnate in the vessels. But it frequently happens, that if one part of the body is exposed to damp, draught, or chilling cold, another part will become inflamed or diseased; and this by reason of the increased activity arising from the extra amount of duty im- posed on such part. As for instance, if the perspiratory vessels and glands on the surface of the body are chilled, so as to prevent them from secreting and passing off the usual quantity of noxious matter, the kidneys, bowels, lungs, and liver are likely to be inflamed through their extra activity occasioned by their endeavours to remove it. In like manner, wet feet, damp clothes, exposed chest, bare legs, and insufficient clothing in cold weather, by throw- ing a disproportionate quantity of blood inwards, tend to bring on internal inflammations and diseases; the evil being increased by a weakly organization and a low state of health, Impure air is productive of some of the most fatal and severe diseases that can afflict humanity. The terrible scourges of plague, pestilence, and malignant fevers, that we so frequently hear of in other countries (and which were once prevalent in our own) are supposed to be occasioned by a vitiated atmosphere; arising from noxious undrained swamps, decaying vegetable and animal sub-

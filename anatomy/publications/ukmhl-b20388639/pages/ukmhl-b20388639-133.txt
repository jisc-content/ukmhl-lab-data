83 THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION. blood, are called ladeals. These are small hair-sized vessels, distributed in countless numbers throughout the upper por- tions of the intestines, and becoming less numerous in the lower portions; they have their openings, or mouths, in the inner surface. But, small as the lacteals are, they are each provided with blood-vessels, nerves, and internal valves, to prevent the chyle which they absorb from again returning into the intestines. These minute vessels, which absorb the chyle, unite to form branches, which, running along between the coats of the intestine, finally pass outwards, and convey their contents into the mesenteric glands. These are small glands, enclosed between the folds of the mesentery, in the interior of which the chyle is still further purified and elaborated, and becomes more and more of the nature of blood. The chyle, after passing through two sets of mesenteric glands, is finally conveyed into the lower portion of the thoracic duct. This duct, or tube, is about the size of a small quill; it extends from the loins upwards, close to the spine, as far as the junction of the left jugular and subclavian veins. Its interior is provided with valves, to prevent the retrograde passage of its contents. The thoracic duct is the common receptacle of the cJii/le and lym;ph; the latter a fluid secreted by the lymphatic vessels. The chyle, and lymph together, being conveyed up the thoracic duct, are emptied, drop by drop, into the venous blood in its progress to the heart. The innutritions portion of the food, passing onwards through all the windings of the small intestines, is finally conveyed into the large intestine; the process of digestion being thus completed. G 2

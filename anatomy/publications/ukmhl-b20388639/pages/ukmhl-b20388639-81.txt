EXCRETION. 39 digestion and stimulating the action of the intestines, is excreted from the body with the innutritions portion of the food. The kidneys not only secrete, and separate from the blood, a larger portion of its superfluous fluid, but also purify^ it from a great variety of noxious substances highly injurious to health. The amount of labour, performed by those two small glands, may be estimated when physiologists declare that as much as a thousand ounces of blood pass through them in an hour. To insure the health of the body, all the excretory organs must properly perform their respective functions; but still nature has wisely caused them to sympathise^ with each other, so that in case either one of them be temporarily deranged, the other organs labour harder to remove the necessary excretion. Tor instance, if the excretory functions of the skin are deranged by a cold, or otherwise, the lungs and kidneys will labour harder than usual in order to purify the system. It may also be necessary to state that whenever we take more food than is required for the use of the body, we un- justly tax a number of organs to perform an extra degree of labour in order to get rid of the superfluity by which extra labour their functions become impaired, disease in- duced, and life shortened. n 9 Purify, to cleanse. Sympathise, to be affected by the state of another part. Superfluity, more than is wanted.

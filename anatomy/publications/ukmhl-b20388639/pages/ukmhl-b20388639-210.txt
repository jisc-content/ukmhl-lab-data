JUST PUBLISHED, POST OCTAVO, PRICE FOUR SHILLINGS. SOCIAL AND POLITICAL MORALITY, BY WILLIAM LOYETT. SIMPKIN, MARSHALL & CO., LONDON. Mr. Lovett, in the volume before us, has endeavoured to show how intimately the prosperity, happiness, and liberty of a nation are connected with the morals of its people ; and for the purpose of indicating the social and political duties of the individual, lays down the several obligations of a member of society under separate heads. Commencing with the mental and moral nature of man, and the nature of society, he proceeds to define morality as " that course of conduct which is best calculated to produce the largest amount of individual and general well-being." He next pro- ceeds to classify the moral duties imposed upon each of us as individuals, as members of society, as domestic beings, as citizens of the state, as members of the great brotherhood of man. There is sound sense, and great natural acumen exhibited in the whole work, and the sections under the title should be widely read among the class they are most adapted to benefit, though their precepts are fitted for every rank. Mr. Lovett de- ducting some abstract propositions not admitted by all politicians, has produced an excellent work which we confidently recommend as calculated to elevate and improve man individually, and, by consequence, society at large.—Morning Advertiser. William Lovett, perceiving that the liberty, prosperity, and happiness of our country have their foundation in the morals of the people, he makes it his aim to teach the best way of controlling the appetites and passions; —in so doing rendering the best service possible to any man. The book has our warm approval, and the public will be the gainer if its circulation is any way commensurate with its merits.—Weekly News and Chronicle.

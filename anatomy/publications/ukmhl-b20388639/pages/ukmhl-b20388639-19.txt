And, if he seeks to make them clearly understand the locality and structure of the different organs as he proceeds, he will find it less difficult to make them understand the functions of such organs. In teaching the function of any organ, or set of organs, it will be well for him to commence with the first process, and then by his questioning to trace, step by step, one process after another on to its completion. As for instance, in the func- tion of digestion he should begin with the first process, that of mastication; showing how it is effected, how the food is moistened, dissolved, elaborated, and absorbed, tracing its gradual progress onwards till the chyle is finally emptied into the venous blood.

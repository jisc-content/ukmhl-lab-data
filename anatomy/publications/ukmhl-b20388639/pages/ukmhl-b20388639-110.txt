On the back of the thigh are threelarge muscles for bending the leg, and on the front of it are four^^ large ones for extending it. There is also a thin oblique muscle, on each thigh, for crossing the legs one over the other. The foot is bent by means of two muscles on the front of the leg, and extended by means of threeothers forming the calf, the lower ends of which unite to form the large tendon at the heel, called the tendon of Achilles. There are also two^^ other muscles on the outer side of the leg, which enable us to turn our foot outwards; and a deep-seated^^ one behind which aids in bending the foot and turning it inwards. The toes are bent by means of two long muscles placed beneath the calf, and a short one^^ placed beneath the foot, the lower ends of which divide into tendons leading to the toes, in a similar manner to those of the fingers. The toes are extended by means of two^^ muscles on the front of the The Biceps femoris. The Semitendinosus, The Semimembranosus. The Eectus femoris.

HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 104 LESSON XII. ABSORPTION, &c. Absorption is that process by which different substances, secreted within the body, are gathered up by various organs and conveyed to the parts required; as well as the process by which various substances are externally absorbed, or taken, into the circulation of the blood. The chief organs of absorption are the lacteal vessels, with their mesenteric glands, the lymphatic vessels and glands, the blood-vessels, and different membranes of the body. The organs for absorbing the nutritious product of di- gestion are the lacteal vessels and mesenteric glands. The lacteals are very minute vessels, having their mouths in the interior of the small intestines, by which they absorb or suck up the chgle. The mesenteric glands are small round- ish bodies, of various sizes, situated in the mesentery, to which the chyle is conveyed by the lacteals, and in which it is purified and elaborated, so as to become more of the nature of blood, previously to its being conveyed into the thoracic duct. The organs for absorbing, or gathering up, such waste or superfluous particles of the body, as it may be necessary to re-introduce into the current of the blood, are the Igm- phatic vessels and glands. The lymphatic vessels are minute transparent tubes, traversing most parts of the body, some of them near the

The chest is covered on each side with four^^ large muscles, two of them for drawing the arms towards the chest, and two for giving support to the shoulder and for assisting in forced respiration. The interior of the chest is separated from the abdomen by means of a thin muscle called the diaphragm, which, with the ribs and the muscles between them, form the principal apparatus for expanding the chest in breathing. The abdomen is covered with five pairs of muscles, their use being to draw the ribs downwards, bend the chest upon the abdomen, and compress the cavity of the bowels. The muscles of the extremities are those of the shoul- ders, arms, and hands; and of the thighs, legs, and feet. The arm, at the shoulder, is raised and moved in its various positions chiefly by means of eight powerful muscles ; the chief, and most important one, on the shoulder, five others rising from the back and shoulder bone, and two from the chest. The arm is flexed, or bent, at the elbow, by means of " The Pectoralis major, The Pectoralis minor, The Subclavius, The Serratus magnus, 19 The Intercostales externi.

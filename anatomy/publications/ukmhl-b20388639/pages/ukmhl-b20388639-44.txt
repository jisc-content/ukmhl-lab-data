HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 10 LESSON IV. THE SKIN AND ITS FUNCTIONS. The skin is that tough elastic membrane which covers our bodies. Its use is to keep the various muscles in their place, and to protect the vessels and nerves beneath it from cold and injury. It is composed of three distinct layers, one over the other. The outside layer, or scarf shin, is a semi-transparent membrane destitute of feeling, and when viewed through a microscope seems to be made up of minute scales, con- structed so as to allow of substances passing in and out between them. The middle layer is a mucous coating^ forming the colour- ing material of the skin, being of different colours in different races. It serves to protect the delicate vessels beneath and to keep the nerves soft and pliable. The under layer, or true shin^ is a thick fibrous mem- brane abounding in blood-vessels, nerves, and glands,^ the upper surface of it forming so complete a net-work of them that the finest needle cannot be inserted without wounding a nerve or blood-vessel. In its functions the skin is an organ of touch, through the medium of its nervous papillae, or the extreme ends of the nerves, which push up the outer covering so as to form little paps. ^ Mucous coating^ a thick tenacious secretion. ' True sJdn, that layer of the skin which in different animals is converted into leather. ^ Glands, organs for secreting some kind of fluid.

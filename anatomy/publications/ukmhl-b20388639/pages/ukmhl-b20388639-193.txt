INTOXICATING DRINKS. 143 The heart and blood-vessels are also liable to disease from the use of those drinks. The irregular circulation caused by the alcohol, and its effect on their interior producing frequent inflammation, tends to weaken the elasticity of the arteries, and to ossify the valves of the heart; giving rise to palpitations, aneurysms, and other maladies. The secretory glands, nerves, and vessels of the skin, have their functions also impaired by alcohol, which prevents noxious matter from escaping, and renders the skin more susceptable of cold; thus producing erruptive and cutaneous disorders, the evidences of which are frequently seen in the blotched face and pimpled red nose of the sot.

This, combined with alcohol, operating on the delicate mem- branes, vessels, and medullary matter of the brain, irritates, hardens, and injures them ; and eventually destroys their functions. Moreover, as every operation of the brain is accompanied by waste, it needs blood to nourish and

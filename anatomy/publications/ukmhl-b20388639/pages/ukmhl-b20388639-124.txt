The various organs employed in the digestion of our food are the mouth, the teeth, the tongue, the sahvary glands, the pharynx, the esophagus, the stomach, the liver, the pancreas, the small and large intestines, the lacteals, the mesenteric glands, and the thoracic duct. The mouth is the cavity formed by the cheeks, the upper and lower jaws, the bony palate above, the soft palate behind, and the lips in front. The muscular parts are covered with a mucuous membrane, and supplied with a number of mucous glands for secreting a fluid to keep the parts soft. The teeth are thirty-two in number,^ sixteen in each jaw; different names being given to them according to their functions for cutting, tearing, and grinding the food. The teeth are firmly fixed in the jaws by their roots or fangs, and the cavities in which they are inserted, are formed of a spongy kind of bone so as to prevent any unpleasant vibra- ting or jarring sensation. The teeth are composed of a dense kind of bone covered over with enamel, and have each a vertical cavity within filled with a pulpy substance. The bony and pulpy portions are amply supplied with blood vessels and nerves, which make * The 8 Incisors, 4 Canine, 8 small Molars, 12 large Molars.

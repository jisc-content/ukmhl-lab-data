HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 56 influence; for if the one be impeded or the other cut the muscle will speedily become paralysed. A number of these fibrous cords united together, and enclosed in a thin delicate sheath of membrane, are called fasciculi; and a number of these united together in a com- mon sheath, with cellular tissue and fat between them, compose the body of the muscle. By this arrangement the different parts of the muscle move, or glide, freely one over the other in all their contractions. The extremities of muscles, or those parts by which they are attached to the bones, are called tendons; these are generally smaller and tougher than the middle or belly of the muscle, and are composed of hard, dense, and exceedingly white fibres. The muscles are abundantly supplied with blood-vessels, lymphatics, and nerves, which are seen traversing the most delicate membrane of the most minute parts. Almost every muscle has its antagonist, or opposing muscle; thus, in our arms and legs, we have one set of muscles to enable us to bend, and another set to extend them, the former are called flexor, and the latter extensor muscles. The mode by which a voluntary muscle acts is supposed to be as follows. The desire of the brain, to move any limb or part of the body, is conveyed or made known to the muscles of that particular part by the neries which branch through them ; called the nerves of motion. The will at the same time imparting its influence through the nerves, stimulates every nervous filament to shrink or contract, and these filaments pervading every part of the muscular fibre *ause the whole muscle likewise to contract; that is to shrink

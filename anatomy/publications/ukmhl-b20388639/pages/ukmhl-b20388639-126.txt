HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 76 membrane. The fibres in the external layer of muscle run lengthway, and those of the internal layer crossway round it, which arrangement gives it a contractile power to expand and close upon the morsel of food which, with the muscles above, force it downwards into the stomach. The stomach is a strong muscular bag, something in the form of a bagpipe. It is capable of containing about three pints of food, although it is more capacious in those persons who live on a bulky innutritions kind of diet. It is situa- ted in the upper portion of the abdomen, the large end being near the ribs on the left side, and its small end nearly opposite the pit of the stomach. It is formed of two muscular and two membraneous coverings; the fibres in the one layer of muscle extending lengthways, and in the other crossway round it, as in the eso- phagus ; an arrangement which gives it the power of con tracting and extending in its length and breadth, producing what is called the vermicular, or worm-like motion. The outside coating is a tough serous membrane, and the internal lining is a mucous membrane, disposed in loose folds or wrinkles, in which are contained the vessels that se- crete the mucous fluid for keeping the parts moist; as well as those which secrete the gastric juice. This juice is a transparent colourless fluid, slightly acid possessing the property of dissolving every description of food. The large end of the stomach, to which the esophagus is joined, is called the cardia, or cardiac opening; and the end attached to the duodenum, by which the food is ex- pelled, is called the pylorus or pyloric end, or opening. The blood-vessels and nerves of the stomach form a complete net work of vessels, and abundantly supply it with blood and nervous energy.

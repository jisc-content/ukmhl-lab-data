108 HUMAN ANATOMY 4ND PPYSIOLOGT, LESSON XIIL THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM. The Brain, and Nerves connected with it, are the especial organs of our sensations, tlioughts, and movements. The nerves are generally distinguished as those of organic and of animal life. They may, however, be conjointly classified into three divisions ; namely, those by which all impressions are made on the brain (through the medium of the senses) called the nerves of sensation;—those by which the brain conveys its desires, and controls different movements of the body, called the nerves of motion;—and those which stimulate and con- trol the functions of different organs within the body, called the sympathetic, or organic, nerves. What is called the nervous system, comprises the brain— the spinal cord—nine pair of nerves proceeding from the brain, and portion of the spinal cord within the skull— thirty-one pair proceeding from the spinal cord without the skull—and the great sympathetic nerves; consisting of a series of nervous branches and ganglia, extending from the base of the skull downwards on each side of the back-bone. The Brain may be considered the great centre of the nervous system ; and the nerves leading to and from it as the instruments of its communications, desires, and resolves. It is an oval-shaped medullary body, filling up the cavity of the skull; which it enlarges and modifies according to its growth and development.

Tobacco smoking produces dyspepsia, or indigestion ; and this in various ways. In the first placed the saliva, so necessary for digestion, is always injured by the acridity of the tobacco, and often wasted by the smoker; thus weakening digestion in two way; by the adulteration of the saliva, and by its scanty supply. In the next place a portion of the tobacco cannot be prevented from entering the stomach; and this, by its sedative noxious qualities, paralysing the nerves, prevents the secretion of healthy gastric juice to dissolve the food. It is supposed that by its operation in this way tobacco weakens the appetite, as well as checks the feelings of hunger, for which purpose it is often taken by the Indians of America. It also occasions indigestion by weakening the muscular energy of the stomach. Tobacco smoking not only thus prevents good blood from being formed by digestion, but also vitiates whatever blood is formed; as it is absorbed into the system in many ways. In the first place its poisonous oil, oozing through a filthy pipe, and coming in contact with a raw place, is directly absorbed by the blood-vessels of the lips, and has been known to produce fatal effects. Its pernicious smoke, inhaled and absorbed by the lungs, readily conveys its noxious properties throughout the body. and so powerfully does it thus operate on weakly constitu- tions as to frequently occasion syncope, or fainting.

45 THE ORGANS OF SENSE. LESSON XVI. THE ORGANS OF SENSE. The ORGANS OF SENSE are the inlets of information to the brain; being those of hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching. The ear is the organ by which all sounds are transmitted to the brain; the air being the medium ^ by which they are conveyed. It is divided into an external ear^ a middle portion or drum, and the internal labyrinth'^ on which the filaments of the nerves are spread out. The eye is the organ of sight; and light ^ is the medium by which the forms and colours of objects are conveyed to it. It is a small globular body, covered with three membranes, and filled with three different transparent substances, called the humours^ of the eye. The circular membrane in front, forming the colour of the eye, is called the iris,^ and the small hole in its centre, for the admission of light, the ^ujpil. The front and outside membrane of the eye is called the cornea. The nose is the organ of smell, and the air is the medium by which odorous particles are conveyed to its interior. Within the nostrils are several passages, lined with a pulpy membrane, on which the filaments of the nerves are spread out. ^ Medium^ the thing used to convey it. ^ Labyrinth, a part having many winding cavities. ' Ligld, a fluid vibrating between the sun and the earth. ^ Humours, called the aqueous, the crystaline, and vitreous humours. ^ Iris, the circular curtain round the pupil of the eye.

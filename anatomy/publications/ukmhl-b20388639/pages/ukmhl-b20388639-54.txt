HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 18 DESCEIPTION OE THE ORGANS OE DIGESTION. PLATE 5. 1. The organs of Mastication; or, the Incisor, Canine, and Molar teeth, 2. The glands which secrete the saliva; or, the Parotid, Submaxillary, and Sublingual glands. 3. The top of the tube into which the food is passed from the mouth ; or the Pharynx. 4. The tube by which the food is conveyed to the stomach; or, the Esophagus. 5. The entrance into the stomach; or its Cardiac end. 6. The chief organ of Digestion, in which the food is dissolved into chyme ; or, the Stomach. 7. The passage for the chyme to pass out of the Stomach; or, its Pyloric end. 8. The position of the Pyloric muscle that guards the passage. 0. The large gland which secretes the bile; or, the Liver. 10. The small bag for containing the bilious secretion; or, the Gall-bladder. 11. The gland (behind the Stomach) for secreting the Panceatic juice; or, the Pancreas. 12. The Spleen; the functions of which are not well understood. 13. The first twelve inches of the small intestines in which the chyle is formed; or, the Duodenum. 14. The organ in which the chyle is absorbed by the lacteals; or, the Small Intestines. 15. The receptacle for the innutritions part of the food; or, the Large Intes- tines. THE SIDE DIAGRAM IS INTENDED TO SHOW THE DIFFERENT ORGANS BY WHICH THE ABSORBED CHYLE IS CONVEYED INTO THE VENOUS BLOOD. d. The Spinal Column. b. Portions of the Small Intestines, with the lacteals penetrating their coats. c. The Lacteals conveying the chyle to the Mesenteric glands. d. The Mesenteric glands emptying their contents into the Thoracic Duct. e. The Thoracic Duct conveying the chyle upwards, and emptying it into the venous blood, at the junction of the Subclavian and Jugular veins.

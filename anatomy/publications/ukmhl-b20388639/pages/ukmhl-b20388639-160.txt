110 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. and between the folds of which is spread out a thin layer of a greyish granular kind of matter; the white being called the medullary, and the grey the cineritious substance of the brain. Beneath the dura mater, already described, are two other membranes covering the brain; one as fine as a spider's web spread out over its surface, called the arachnoid, and the other a thin membrane abounding in blood-vessels, penetrating deeply between the convolutions, called thej»f« mater. The Spinal Cord, or main trunk of the nervous system, is a collection of nerves and nervous matter enclosed in the cavity of the back-bone. It is connected with the brain above, and extends as far downwards as the second lumbar bone. Its form is that of a flattened cylinder; its size about half an inch in diameter, somewhat enlarged at the lower part of the neck and loins, where the nerves of the extre- mities have their origin. It is enveloped in three membranes similar to those of the brain, which are continuous with them; and is guarded from pressure by the fluid secretions of the membranes, and by being surrounded with a soft fatty substance. It is partially divided, by a front and back fissure, into two equal parts, and each of these is again sub-divided into three divisions, so that the whole may be said to be made up of six columns; the front and side columns being nerves of motion, and the back columns nerves of sensation. The interior of the spinal cord contains a layer of cineri- tious matter, similar to what is found on the outside of the brain. The NINE pairs of, what are called, cranial nerves.

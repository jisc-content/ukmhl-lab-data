THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION. 81 pyloric end of the stomach, are allowed to pass out by the muscles of that orifice relaxing. The same process takes place as every small quantity is digested, till the whole has passed out into the duodenum. But though the pylorus readily relaxes so as to enable the digested portion to pass, it generally refuses passage to the indigested particles ; and it is only after such indigested portion becomes troublesome to the stomach, that the pylorus, or gate-keeper as it is sometimes called, allows it to pass onwards. But, whenever a larger quantity of food is taken into the stomach than usual, the gastric vessels are not at once prepared with gastric juice sufficient to digest it; in which case the food lies very uneasily in the stomach, till a sufficient quantity is secreted, occasioning what is called indigestion. In like manner, if very indigestible food is taken, the gastric vessels have to secrete a stronger kind of juice, or to make it more acid than usual; and this circumstance also occasions the same distressing feeling. Indigestion may, however, proceed from many other causes. Large quantities of fluid taken into the stomach, beyond what is necessary to moisten the food, pass off, for the most part, by another process than that of digestion; being ahÂ» sorhed by the capillary vessels of the stomach. The food so far digested, or reduced to a rather liquid state, in the manner described, is called chyme, and the process called chgmification. The duodenum, into which the chyme passes, is provided with similar coatings as the stomach, but, as it is partly fixed in its place, its contractions are less active. The loose folds, or plaits, in the inner membrane cause the food to pass slowly along, as well as afford a greater space for containing G

HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 184 and uniiatural feeling created; inducing a desire for food beyond the power of the stomach to digest it, or the re- quirements of the body if it could. The undue quantity of food thus consumed, through a vitiated and depraved appetite, and not required for the wants of the system, not only tends still further to weaken the stomach, but to disorder other organs by their efforts to get rid of the superfluity. Injury to health is also done by taking our meals imme- diately after violent exercise, as well as by resuming our labours the moment we have done eating ; a short rest being requisite, so as to allow the excess of blood to return from the extremities, the stomach requiring a large supply of it for the purposes of digestion. Respecting drinh it may be necessary to state, that copious draughts of cold liquids are injurious to the stomach during meals, or immediately after them; as they weaken its digestive powers by lowering its necessary temperature, as well as render its contents too diluted for easy digestion. With some kinds of food no liquid is required, and the small quantity needed for moistening very dry food should be slowly taken, and this warmed a little by the mouth before it is swallowed. Tea and coffee, forming so large a portion of the diet of our population, are beverages not only cheering and refresh- ing in all the circumstances of cold, heat, thirst, and fatigue; but are in their chemical nature highly beneficial to health. Their azotized principles are said to be superior to those of any other vegetable compounds in promoting the healthful secretion of bile, and by that means the purification of the blood ; to which may be attributed their salubrious in- fluence on the system.

THE SKIN AND ITS FUNCTIONS. H * It is an organ of secretion,* as it secretes, or separates, the waste fluid from the blood, called perspiration or sweat. It is also an organ of excretion,^ that is, it passes off, by sensible and insensible perspiration, the waste fluid, and other noxious materials of the body. It is likewise an organ of absorption,^ that is, it readily draws in and passes into the circulation of the blood various substances brought in contact with it. It has been estimated, that of all the food taken into the body, more than one-third passes out again through the pores of the skin; and this fact clearly shows to us the great necessity for keeping the pores unobstructed. The innumerable vessels and nerves beneath the skin also show us the necessity for warm clothing to protect them against damp and cold. QUESTIONS. What is the skin, and what its use ?

HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. LESSON X. ORGANS OE RESPIRATION. The organs of respiration^ are the trachea, the bronchi, the lungs, diaphragm, and muscles of the chest; together with the vessels for conveying the blood to and from the lungs. The trachea^ or wind-pipe, is the tube by which the air is admitted from the mouth into the lungs ; the top of it being called the larynx, or vocal organ. The trachea, on entering the chest, separates into two branches, called the bronchi, one going into each lung. These branches separate into smaller and smaller bran- ches, within the lungs, till at last they terminate in little globular cells; the small branches being called bronchi, or bronchial tubes, and the cells air vesicles. The lun^s are situated on each side of the chest, extend- ing from about the first rib to the diaphragm. They are two light spongy bodies, chiefly made up of tubes, air vesicles, arteries, veins, nerves, and lymphatics ;^ the tubes and cells being lined with a thin mucous membrane, and the whole being enveloped, and attached to the sides of the chest, by a tough serous membrane called the pleura. The blood is conveyed from the heart into the lungs by the two branches of the pulmonary artery \ these separate * Respiration, the act of breathing. ^ The trachea and bronchial tubes are always kept open to receive the air, by means of little rings of cartilage. ^ Lymphatics, vessels to remove waste matter.

On the threshold of his enquiries, his admiration and wonder will be excited as each link in the chain of being is passed in review before him, and he is made to perceive how necessary the existence of each is to the order and happiness of the whole. Physiology represents to him a series of vital organisms, from the most simple to the most comphcated, by which stones, earth, air, and water, are gradually converted into vegetable forms, clothing earth's nakedness with scenes of beauty, and providing subsistence for the varied tribes which dwell upon its surface; whose continuous existence, from the zoophyte to man, is dependant on that vital chemistry which converts the dead matter into a living thing. His own digestive functions are in themselves a curious volume of chemical phenomena; in which is traced the complicated process by which every description of food is dissolved, changed, and elaborated, so as to form the living fluid on which existence depends. And when he observes the admirable mechanism for

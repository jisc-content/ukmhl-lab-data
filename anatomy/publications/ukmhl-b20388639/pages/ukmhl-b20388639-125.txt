THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 75 them highly sensitive when exposed ; but the hard enamelled surface, not being organized, serves to blunt their sensibility, as well as to prevent them from being quickly worn away. The tongue, or principal organ of taste and speech, is made up of six muscles interlaced in each other; it is en- veloped in a mucous membrane, and supported at its base by a small bone. It is well provided with blood vessels and nerves, the latter being spread out over its surface in those visible little papillae, which give it the exquisite sense of taste. Four principal muscles are also provided for the different movements of the tongue. The salivary glands are those organs by which the saliva is secreted for mixing with our food. They are six in num- ber, three on each side of the mouth. They are easily excited by the thought of food, and frequently pour forth as much as half a pint of saliva during a meal. The pharynx is the large cavity in the back of the mouth, which forms the upper portion of the esophagus or food pipe. There are six passages leading out of this cavity; two of them to the nose, two to the ears, one to the windpipe, itself constituting the other. The opening into the wind- pipe is called the glottis, and a little valve attached to the root of the tongue (called the epiglottis) is provided for closing up the glottis when we are swallowing our food. The passages into the back of the mouth are closed up in the act of swallowing by the soft palate, which in rising up to admit the passage of the food completely folds over them. The esophagus, or tube which conveys the food to the stomach, being the lower portion of the pharynx, is situated behind the windpipe. It is made up of two layers of muscles, a membraneous envelope, and a mucous lining

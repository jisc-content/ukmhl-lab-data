HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 120 at the root to the hyoides; a small bone somewhat of the form of a horse shoe. The sensation of taste is said to be produced in the following manner. The substance applied to the tongue, being moistened and partially dissolved by the saliva, is pressed against the sides and roof of the mouth, to bring it in closer contact, and to more readily excite the nervous papilla on the surface of the tongue. The filaments of the nerves, thus impressed, convey to the brain the peculiar taste of the substance tested; there are, however, some sub- stances, taken into the mouth, that are partially tested by the sense of smell. The sense of touching, or feeling, may be said to be common not only to all the organs described, but also to most parts of the body. Those parts, however, the most sensitive, and discriminating as organs of touch, are the lips and extremities of the fingers; the former taking cognizance of all substances entering the mouth, and the latter being in a great measure the especial organs of touch. The nerves of sensation, distributed to the surface of the body, generally terminate in minute conical bodies called nervous papillce, formed by little loop-like filaments of the nerves pushing up from beneath the outer membrane of the skin; each papillae being also supplied with minute branches of the blood vessels. Over the general surface of the body the papillae are small, and irregularly disposed; but on the palms of the hands and extremities of the fingers they are large and pro- minent, arranged in parallel rows, forming the minute ridges seen on those parts. The sense of touch is produced by contact with the thing felt, and is heightened by our attention towards it;

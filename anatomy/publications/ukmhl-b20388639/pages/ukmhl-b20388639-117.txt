69 THE INTERIOR OF THE BODY. LESSON IV. THE INTERIOR OF THE BODY, The organs and parts in the interior of the body will be best understood if described under the divisions of the head, NECK, and TRUNK. The organs of the head are the brain, or organ of our tlioughts and feehngs; the four organs of sense, namely, of hearing, seeing, smelling, and tasting; as also the organs for masticating our food; being the mouth, teeth, and salivary glands. In the NECK, or upper portion of the trunk, are contained the larynx, the trachea, the pharynx, the esophagus, the upper portion of the spinal cord, and those branches of the veins and arteries which convey the blood into and out of the head. The larynx is the organ of voice; it forms the upper part of the trachea, or wind-pipe, which is the cylindrical tube, situated in front of the neck, for conveying the air down to the lungs. The pharynx is that membranous bag which is situated immediately behind the wind-pipe, into which the food is passed from the mouth in the act of swallowing; it forms the upper part of the esophagus, the tube which conveys the food down to the stomach. The spinal cord is that large branch of the nerves, pro- ceeding downwards from the brain, which is enclosed in the cavity of the back-bone. The vessels which convey the pure blood to the head are called the carotid arteries ;l those which take back the impure blood to the heart are jugular veins.

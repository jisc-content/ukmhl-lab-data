PREFACE. 16, South Row, New Road. teacher who may not have made those two sciences his study, as well as afford an additional means of impressing the previous lessons on the memories of the children, I thought it advisable to add the Advanced Series as reading lessons, for those who may like to adopt them. And in the foot-notes to this series I have also given a list of a greater number of muscles, with their technical names at length, for the benefit of those students who may wish to make themselves further acquainted with that branch of anatomy. In both series many repetitions may seem to be uncalled-for, but I have thought it well to make them for the pupil's sake. The experienced teacher need not to be reminded that it will be well at all times to prepare his lessons; as this will give him power of condensation, and facility of explana- tion, not attainable by his mere dependence on the text- book, or by his relying on the thoughts of the moment. Hoping that the desire to be useful may plead an excuse for the freedom of these observations, and that the ardent desire to see these two sciences more generally taught in our public and private schools will be some apology for the imperfections of the work, I most respectfully submit it to the public.

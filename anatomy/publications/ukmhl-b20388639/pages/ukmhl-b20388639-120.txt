HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 73 in its largest part, and is somewhat of the form of a bag- pipe. It is situated in the upper part of the abdomen, chiefly on the left side under the false ribs. The left and largest end is united to the esophagus, (the tube by which the food enters), its opening being called the cardiac; the opening of the right and small end, for the exit of the food, is called the pylorus. The small intestines are small membranous tubes, about an inch in diameter, and about twenty-five feet in length. They are disposed in folds throughout the middle and lower portion of the abdomen, and are attached to the spine by means of a membrane called the mesentery; in which mem- brane the mesenteric glands are disposed. The first twelve inches of the small intestines, proceed- ing from the pyloric end of the stomach, is called the duodenum ; it is the portion in which the chyle begins to be formed. The remaining portion of the small intestines, in which the chyle is absorbed, is called the jejunum and the ilium. The large intestine^ the receptacle for the innutritions part of the food, is between five and six feet in length, and from an inch and a-half to two inches in diameter. It is united to the lower end of the small intestines, and is dis- posed in a large fold around them; its commencement is called the coecum, and its termination the rectum; the in- termediate part being called the colon. The liver J or large gland which secretes the bile, and separates impurities from the blood, is situated in the upper portion of the abdomen, close to the diaphragm, principally on the right side, although a portion of it extends across to the left. It is of an irregular form, divided into two lobes; its length being from ten to twelve inches, its breadth from six to seven, and its weight from three to four pounds.

SECRETION. 103 Taking, therefore, into account the extreme minuteness and vast numbers of these membranous cells, and more especially in the large glands of the body, we see that they make up a secretory surface of incalculable extent. But curious and wonderful as is the structure of the whole glandular system, its functions are still more so; for the mode by which the same vital current secretes so many varied productions has hitherto eluded all investigation. It is found, however, that the nervous system has great power over the secretions, through the medium of the nervous filaments, which are spread out in vast numbers over the capillaries which cover each secretory cell. Thus the^hought even of food will stimulate the flow of the saliva, bad news will check the secretion of the gastric vessels, and the mother's milk will flow at the sight, or even the thought, of her child. It is found, also, that the different organs of secretion throughout the body strongly sympathize with one another, although their functions may be dissimilar. Thus, if any- thing interferes with the functions of the lungs, so as to prevent the due secretion of carbonic acid from the blood, the liver immediately sympathizes and secretes, and passes out through the bowels a larger amount of carbonaceous impurities. In like manner, if the secretory functions of the skin are affected, so as to prevent the waste fluids and noxious ingre- dients from passing outwards through its pores, the kidneys or bowels at once perform additional labour to get rid of them. This sympathy between different organs, causing some of them to perform double duty, will account for their fre- quent derangement; they being often tasked beyond their powers.

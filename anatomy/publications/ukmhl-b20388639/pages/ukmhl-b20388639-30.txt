2 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. The great distinction between the vegetable and animal world is, that the latter possesses two distinct kinds of lives, and the former, as far as we can judge, but only one. The beings of the vegetable world are provided with organs for sustaining themselves on a particular spot of earth or water; they possess what is called an organic life. Those of the animal world have also an organic life, but in addition to that they have, from the lowest to the highest forms, some power of choice and motion; this is called their animal life. In human beings the functions of their organic life are those of digestion, circulation, respiration, secretion, &c.â€” of their animal life, those of sensation, thought, will, motion, &c. The human body is made up of a great variety of parts, and these parts of upwards of twenty different substances; such as bone, muscle, tendon, cartilage, ligament, membrane, nerve, fat, &c., the whole of which have been built up and are constantly nourished by one life-sustaining fluid the blood.

HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 26 back again to the heart by four vessels, called the pulmonary veins, and by them is emptied into the left auricle. The left auricle immediately contracting forces the blood downÂ» through a small valve,^ into the left venticle, which also contracting forces it up into the aorta, by which it is con- veyed to the different arteries of the body. The blood being thus distributed by the arteries into smaller and smaller branches, is conveyed at last by the arterial capillaries'^ to every minute part of the body. Here the blood begins its wondrous work of nutrition; that is it builds up, out of the same fluid, bone, muscle, fat, nerve, brain, and every other substance of the body. By this process a portion of the nutritious elements^ is extracted from the blood, and the waste and carbonacious matter combining with it causes it to become what is called venous or impure blood. These small venous or impure streams in their way back to the heart first enter into the venous capillaires (which are continuous with the arterial capillaires), and these convey it into larger and larger branches till at last it is again emptied by the two vena cavae into the right auricle of the heart; to be again circulated in the manner described. The veins of the intestines, however, first pour their contents into a large trunk called the vena porta, by which the venous blood is distributed throughout the liver to form the secretion^ called bile, before it is emptied into the vena cavae. ^ The Mitral valve. ^ Capillaries, hair-sized vessels.

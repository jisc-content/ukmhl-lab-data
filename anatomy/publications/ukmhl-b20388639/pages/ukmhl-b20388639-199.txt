The habit of snuff taMng is no less injurious to the health of those who indulge in it than are the habits de- scribed ; and, from the frequent snuffing, the constant blow- ing, the begrimed face, the besmeared clothes, and the float- ing particles wafted in all directions, is perhaps still more loathsome and offensive to others. As the particles of snuff find their way into the back of the mouth, by the passage of the nostrils, their pernicious effect on the stomach, and other internal organs, are similar to those produced by the habits of smoking and chewing. Snuff also, by its poisonous and acrimonious qualities, corrodes the lining membrane of the nose, and thus occasions that snuffling inarticulate pronunciation we so frequently witness among inveterate snuff takers. And by its impair- ing the minute filaments of the olfactory nerves, which are spread out over the pituitary membrane, the sense of smell is often blunted, and frequently destroyed. The eyes of snuflp-takers are likewise affected in many ways by this vicious habit, and blindness often ensues. Their sense of vision is often impaired, by the constant drain of the fluids which snuff occasions; its pungent properties unnaturally exciting the secretions, produce the same decaying effect on the humours of the eye as is seen in the eyes of aged persons. The floating particles of snuff have also a direct tendency to inflame the eyes, often leading to the loss of sight; for persons employed in the manufacture of snuff are particu- larly subject to inflammation of the eyes, lungs and digestive organs.

73 THE INTERIOR OF THE BODY. The gall bladder, for containing the bile, is on the under surface of the liver, and a small duct leads from it into the duodenum. The pancreas, or the gland which secretes the pancreatic juice, is situated behind the stomach, close to the spine, its left end extending as far as the spleen. It is from six to seven inches long, and about two inches broad, it has also a small duct, which uniting with the duct from the gall blad- der, leads into the duodenum. The spleen, the functions of which are not clearly ascer- tained, is an irregular oval-shaped mass, about four inches long, and three inches broad. It is situated on the left side, behind the large end of the stomach. The kidneys are the two glands by which the water is secreted. They are of the form of a scarlet bean, and, in the adult, are from four to five inches long, and about two and a-half inches broad. They are situated opposite the two last dorsal and two first lumber bones, one on each side of the spine; they are generally enveloped in a quantity of fat. Two excretory tubes, about the size of a quill, leading from the kidneys to the bladder, are called the ureters. The bladder, or the receptacle of the w^ater, is a mem- braneous bag situated in the cavity of the pelvis. The interior of the abdomen, like that of the chest, is lined with a thin membrane, called the peritoneum, which is extended in a manner so as to envelope, secure, and protect the different organs contained therein. That portion of it which envelopes the small intestines is called the mesentery ; that of the large intestine the meso-colon; and another portion of it in front, called the omomentum; between the folds of which a large quantity of fat is deposited, for protecting the abdominal organs from cold.

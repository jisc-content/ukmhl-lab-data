HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGT. 92 time preventing the return of the blood, forces it up in the aorta, or chief branch of the arteries. The blood, being sent into the aorta, with a force capa- ble of sustaining a column of blood eight feet in height, is conveyed into its different branches, and by them into smaller and smaller arteries, until it is finally distributed by the capillary arteries into every tissue of the body. It is in the capillary arteries that the process of nutrition, or the building up and repairing of the different parts of the body, seems to begin ; the blood depositing in its course fibrous particles to nourish the muscles, bony materials for the bones, nervous matter for the brain, and in like manner materials for nourishing all parts of the body; the various particles seeming to possess an attractive power for the part or substance analagous to their own nature. The blood by this process of nutrition parts with a por- tion of its sustaining and nutritive qualities, as well as with the oxygen it acquired in the lungs ; and acquiring in re- turn the waste and decaying particles of the different tissues, and the carbon consequent on that waste, becomes venous, or impure; being charged with carbonaceous and noxious materials injurious to the system. In coursing its way back to the heart it passes from the arterial into the venous capillaries, and by these is conveyed into larger and larger veins until it is finally brought back again to the heart by the two vena cavce; there to be again circulated in the manner described. From the description given it will be seen, that, while the arteries convey pure blood and the veins impure in the general circulation of the body, in the lungs this process is reversed; the arteries in them conveying impure blood, and the veins pure.

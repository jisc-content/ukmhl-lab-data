HUMAN ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY, &c. ELEMENTARY SERIES OF LESSONS. LESSON I. PHYSIOLOGY, &c. All living beings have a peculiarity of form and struc- ture, and are provided with difiPerent organs^ for promoting their growth and nourishment. The science of Anatomy makes us acquainted with the form, structure, position, and connection of those different parts and organs which belong to the being irrespective of life. The science of Physiology is that which makes us acquainted with the functions, or actions, of all those organs; and of all those general laws necessary for preserving the life of the being. Physiology is divided into three great branches—the first, describing the functions of the vegetable world, is called Vegetable Fhysiology; the second, treating of the whole animal kingdom, is called Animal or Comparative Fhysiology; and the third, which treats of human beings in particular, is called Human Physiology. The science of Anatomy admits also of different divisions. ^ An organ is an arrangement of parts for performing a particular action or function—thus the stomach is an organ for performing the func- tion of digestion.

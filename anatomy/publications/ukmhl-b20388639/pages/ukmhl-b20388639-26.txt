INTRODUCTION. xxii said to be his master and instructor—in prudentially storing up the plenty of summer for the wants of winter, the ant, the squirrel, and the bee are greatly his superiors—and in the arts of building, spinning, weaving, and plastering, the beaver, silkworm, spider, bee, bird, and insect, are many of them centuries in advance of his first rude and barbarous efibrts. But nature, having endowed him with high mental and moral powers, giving him keener perceptions and superior reasoning faculties, and having likewise bestowed on him the gift of communicating his ideas to his fellows, has ena- bled him gradually to disseminate his discoveries—to con- struct language—to record his experience—and to make the knowledge and wisdom of the past contribute to the wants of the present. By these powers he may be said to have conquered all the kingdoms of nature, and have still unexhausted fields before him for future conquests. His million-peopled cities, daily supplied and peacefully and orderly conducted, proclaim his progress and attest his triumphs, over the forest hut, the precarious subsistence, and hourly dangers of a savage life. His labour-saving mechanism, his wondrous productive powers, his achievements in manufactures, his skill in art, his patient plodding industry, unwearied application and prudent foresight, prove how successfully he has mastered the careless indolence, the momentary impulse, and dark ignorance of primitive barbarism.

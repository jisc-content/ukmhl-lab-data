Some of these vessels secrete a fluid, of a solvent nature, which mixes with the food when it enters; and it is also into this organ that the hile ^Vi^ pancreatic juices are poured. These two last fluids, flowing through their respective ducts, enter by a common duct into the duodenum about four inches from the stomach end ; and drop by drop being mixed with the prepared chyme, effect on it an extraordinary change. They change what was previously chyme into two kinds of fluids, the one a milky, white, nutritious fluid called chyle; and the other a yellowish, thick, innutritious portion, both which substances pass down into the small intestines together. This part of the process of digestion is called cliylijication. The juicy secretions from the pancreas and liver not only serve to effect this change, but they help to digest food which the stomach is sometimes obliged to cast out undi- gested. They also impart highly nutritious particles to the chyle, so as to bring it nearer to the nature of blood; and they also stimulate and promote the action of the intestines. The small intestines, into which the chyle next enters, are also provided with muscular and membranous coatings which impart to them a vermicular motion ; and this motion is accelerated by the upward and downward movements of the diaphragm in the process of breathing. Their mem- braneous lining, similar to that of the stomach, is abundantly supplied with blood-vessels, nerves, glands, and absorbents ; and is also arranged so as to form loose folds, close to each other, which prevent their contents from passing too rapidly along, and greatly enlarge the surface. The vessels employed for the absorption, or sucking up of the chyle, in order to pass it onwards to mix with the

HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 138 and is proved to be so by its effects on animal life; a small portion of it being sufficient to kill a dog, almost instan- taneously ; and no very large portion of it taken into the human stomach has often proved fatal. When alcohol is taken into the stomach it is rapidly absorbed by the gastric vessels, and, passing into the circu- lation of the blood, is instantly conveyed to the brain; an organ which it irritates and excites in an especial manner, from the great affinity which it has for nervous matter. When a moderate quantity of it is drank, the first sensa- tion is that of warmth in the stomach, accompanied with an increased circulation of the blood, and an excited action of the brain; producing a wild and incoherent fancy, a flow of thought, often without order, and too frequently stimulating the passions beyond the control of the superior faculties. This excited state (the power of mental control being weakened) stimulates drinkers to exhibit, without reserve, their prominent propensities; causing some to be quarrel- some and pugnacious, some to be ridiculously vain, some to talk sillily and act stupidly, some to sing boisterously, and others to be devoutly melancholy and sad. These first effects are said to be produced by the poi- sonous nature of the alcohol unnaturally stimulating the blood-vessels, disordering the blood, irritating the brain, and giving a forced energy to the muscles ; effects similar to those which are produced by many other kinds of poison when first taken into the system. When, however, an additional quantity of intoxicating drink is taken a reaction takes place; the blood-vessels be- come weakened and distended, the circulation somewhat im- peded, the respiration slower, the heart and lungs oppressed, the mental powers obscured and wandering, the sight clouded,

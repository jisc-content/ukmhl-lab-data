SECRETION. 35 nerves stimulating^ the arteries to elaborate the oily portion of the blood and pass it through the pores of these little membraneous bags into the interior ; where it is stored up till required. The secretion of other substances is supposed to be effected in a similar manner. The more complicated glands of the body are however made up of vast numbers of some such simple organs ; vary- ing their forms and lengths in different glands. But whether they are in the form of cells, follicles, or branching tubes, each simple elementary organ has its branches of arteries, veins and nerves spread out over its surface ; the whole of them being connected together, and enveloped in a mem- brane. Some of them are provided with vessels for con- taining the secretion, as well as ducts for conveying it to the part required. The membranes lining the large compartments of the body are not glanular, but secrete a simple fluid by the agency of blood-vessels and nerves only. , QUESTIONS. What is meant by secretion ?

PREFACE. xiii functions of the body, I have deemed it unnecessary to in- troduce any more than the most important of the muscles ; a knowledge of the deep-seated ones being important only to those of the profession. The illustrations, suited to the lessons, have been drawn, lithographed, and coloured with some care, in order that teachers might be enabled to pre- pare others from them on a large scale. Those which I have found to be a good size, and which I have taught from myself, are about a yard and a half long, by two feet nine inches wide.

They are hung up and kept extended by means of two slips of hard wood, of an inch and a half wide, inserted into three loops of tape sewed to each end of the diagram. This plan I have found better than any permanent frame-work or roller, as two slips of wood will do for the whole set, and when taken out the diagrams can be rolled up in a small compass, and be better preserved from dust and injury. Persons having such diagrams made would be saved tlie trouble and incon- venience of mounting them, as well as find it the more economical, were they to procure the diagram paper already mounted and prepared for drawing on. This they can obtain, in London, of Mr. Charlton, at the Geological Society's Rooms, Somerset House, of whom I have purchased the paper for my own diagrams. It is mounted in lengths of about twelve yards long, and a yard and a half wide, and any number of yards can be obtained at two shillings a yard running measure. It might also be useful information to

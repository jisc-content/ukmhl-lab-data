54 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. The bones are composed, for the most part, oiphosphate of lime and gelatine, with a minute portion of other earthy and animal substances. In infancy the gelatine prepond- erates, so that children require careful nursing and proper food to prevent their soft limbs from becoming crooked and deformed. In old age the lime preponderates, so that the bones of old people become very brittle and more difficult to unite again when any part is broken. In the formation and growth of bones, the ossification, or the deposit of the hard bony matter, generally begins at a central spot, and radiates towards the extremities. The bones of the teeth are harder and denser than other bones, being of the nature of ivory; the surface of them are also covered over with a crystalized substance called enamel.

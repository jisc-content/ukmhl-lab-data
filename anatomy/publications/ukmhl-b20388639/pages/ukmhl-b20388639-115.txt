THE SKINâ€”ITS FUNCTIONS. 67 spiral ducts leading up from the glands ' in which it is secreted. It also excretes or passes outward the oily fluid prepared by secretion. 4th. It is an organ of absorption; as it draws in^ and passes into the general circulation of the blood, many sub- stances brought in contact with it. The power of absorp- tion is greatly blunted by the cuticle, or we could not so handle noxious substances with impunity; but still we find that many substances are absorbed when the skin is warm and moist, and more especially when gentle friction is ap- plied, as is sometimes done for passing medicines through. When, however, the cuticle is lifted up or altogether removed, substances are very actively absorbed, as is seen in cases of inoculation, vaccination, bites of venomous animals, and when poisonous substances are dropped upon excoriations. The pores of the body are so numerous that upwards ot two thousand of them are found in. the compass of every square inch. Calculations have also been made, from ex- periments, that as much as from a pound-and-half to two pounds of a salt acid oily fluid pass off through the pores of the body, by invisible perspiration, every twenty-four hours; and that as much as from three to five pounds of visible perspiration, or sweat, are passed off, in one hour, from a person working very hard in a hot place. It has also been estimated, that out of every 9G ozs. of food taken into the body, about 34 ozs. of it are passed out again through the pores of the skin. The skin, therefore, being to such an extent an exhalant^ or perspiring organ, if its vessels are by any means obstructed, the work of passing off this large amount of refuse matter ^ The Sudoriparom glands.

NUTRITION. 99 for the building up and nourishing of bone, muscle, tendon, membrane, nerve, and every other part of the body ; and Nutrition is that great and subtile operation of nature by which those different elements are deposited on the parti- cular parts required, and there only. The current of blood, sent by the force of the heart into the capillaries, which pervade every part of the body, per- forms the work of nutrition while in those vessels ; but how that work is carried on is not so clearly ascertained. The process has, however, been thought by some to be analogous to that which takes place in the air vesicles of the lungs; where a mutual exchange of different substances takes place through the deUcate membrane of which they are composed. As therefore the membraneous coverings of the arterial capillaries are still more delicate in their texture than those of the air vesicles, it is supposed that the affinity between the elements, within and without the capillaries, may cause the oxygen and nutritious part of the blood to pass out through their membraneous coverings, and to be deposited on the part required; while at the same time the carbon and waste particles are passed inwards, through the sides of the capillaries, and thus conveyed into the current of blood; animal heat being generated by the process. But, by whatever means the deposition or change may be effected, it seems clear that the arterial current in its circulation through the body deposits bony particles on bone, muscle on muscle, and in like manner on every substance of the body the material analogous to its nature. But whether this is effected by an attractive property between the elements, or by the agency of the minute nervous fila- ments which are numerously spread out over the surface H 2

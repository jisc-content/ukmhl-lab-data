53 THE BONES. :ower parts of the leg-bones are joined to seven oones, which form the heel and instep of the foot, arranged so as to form a strong arch in front. The bones of the instep are joined to five^^ bones, which form the sole, or middle of the foot, to the ends of which are joined the toes. The toes,^^ like the fingers, have each three bones, excepting the great toe, which has only two. All the various joints of the body are bound to each other by strong ligaments, so tough that the bone will generally break before the ligament will give way. Where the bones meet to form movable joints, the ends are covered over with a smooth, white, gristly substance, so that they may move freely one over the other; the parts are also lubricated by means of a fluid secreted by a mem- brane contained in each joint. Between each joint of the back-bone there is also a thick layer of a soft gristly sub- stance, forming a springy cushion, to prevent the brain and spinal-cord from being injured by any concussion or sudden blow. The bones are supplied with blood-vessels, nerves, and lymphatics, to enable them to derive growth and nutriment from the blood, though these organs are not so numerous as in many other parts of the body. When a bone is broken, if it be properly set, or the parts placed against each other, the ends of the fractures readily secrete bony matter for cementing them again. The seven instep, or Tarsal bones. The five foot, or Metatarsal bones. Fourteen toe-bones, or Phalanges of the foot. Called Cartilage. " Called Synovia.

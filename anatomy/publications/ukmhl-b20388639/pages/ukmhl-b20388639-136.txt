HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 86 branches to supply the head and neck with blood; two^ others to supply the upper portion of the trunk, the arms, fore- arms, and hands; and two* others to supply the heart itself. As the aorta proceeds downwards through the thorax it sends off three ^ branches from each side to supply the in- ternal muscles, and vessels and organs contained in it; and in like manner, in its course through the abdomen, it sends off nine^ branches to supply the various organs and parts belonging to this cavity. The division of the aorta, into the two^ large branches of the lower extremities, takes place opposite the fourth lumbar bone; from which divisions a number of smaller branches are sent off to supply the lower portion of the trunk. The large or main ^ branches in their course through the thighs send off minor branches, and when they reach below the knees each of them separate into three^ branches, which go to supply the legs, feet,^^ and toes, with blood. From these large divisions and branches of the arteries ^ The Subclavian and Axillary arteries; these become the Brachial in the arms, the Radial and Ulnar in the fore-arms, and the Palmar arteries in the Hand. ^ The Coronary arteries. * The Thoracic branches are the Bronchial, the Esophageal, and Intercostal arteries. ^ The Abdominal branches are the Phrenic, Coeliac, Superior Mesentric, Spermatic, Inferior Mesentric, Supra-Eenal, Eenal, Lumbar, and Sacral Median arteries. ' The Iliac arteries, becoming— * The Pemoral and Popliteal in the thighs, ® The Pront and Back Tibial, and Peroneal in the legs, and The Plantar arteries in the feet.

HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 130 and animal, may be classified under four heads; distin- guished as the saccharine, or sugary—the oleaginous, or oily —^the albuminous, or white of egg like—and the gelatinous, or glue like. The two first classes of these substances from their not containing azote (or nitrogen) in their composition, are called non azotised ^ substances, and the two last, from their containing azote, are called azotised^ substances; distinc- tions necessary to be observed, from the fact, that the latter, when taken as food, help to build up the different tissues of the body, while the former, by their combustion with oxygen, only serve to keep up the animal heat of the system. In most kinds of food, in common use, these two classes of substances are found, though combined in very difierent proportions ; one class being in its nature best adapted to' afibrd nourishment to the difierent tissues, and the other, by its combustion within the body, to keep up its proper tem- perature. Among vegetable productions, beans and peas contain about one part of nutriment to two parts of heat-producing matter ; oatmeal about one of the former to five of the latter, wheat flour about one to eight, potatoes one to nine, rice one to ten, while sago and arrow root contain only one part of nutriment to twenty-six parts of heat-producing food. Animal food however (including fish and flesh) contains by far the largest proportion of azotised, or tissue nourish- ing qualities; excepting the fatty and oily portions of them which belong to the non azotised, or heat-imparting class. * Non azotised substances are compounds of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon. ^ Azotized substances are compounds of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen.

THICKNESS OF THE SIDES OF THE HEART. 39 ternally, by which the Auricles are distinguished from each other. The remaining sides of the Right Auricle, except where there is any of that net-work of Fleshy Cords formerly de- scribed, are about an eighth of an inch thick; but in the furrows between these.Cords, they are so thin as to be semi- transparent ; and opposite the Cords themselves, they are sometimes nearly a quarter of an inch in thickness. The other sides of the Left Auricle, are, every where, about an eighth of an inch; excepting at the Tip, which is thinner, particularly opposite to the furrows which were described on its inner surface. The posterior surfaces of the Right Ventricle, and the anterior and upper third of the Left are formed by the op- posite sides of a common Septum. The edge of this partition looking towards the Base of the Heart, has its lower half continued into the left margin of the Septum of the Auricles, v'hile the upper half is part- ly connected to the root of the Aorta, and partly to that portion of the base of the Right Ventricle which is betwixt the Auricular and the Arterial Orifice. The upper and lower margins of this Septum, have the corresponding edges of the upper and lower sides of each Ventricle attached to them; and it is along the course of this attachment, that the groove formerly described as pointing out the division between the Ventricles externally, runs. The Septum of the Ventricles varies in thickness in dif- ferent parts. It is no where less than a third of an inch ; but opposite to some of the larger Fleshy Columns it is more. The thickest part is in general between those smooth surfaces in each Ventricle which lead to the Arterial Orifices. At the base, where it is connected with the Septum of the Au- ricles, and the other parts already mentioned, it is consi- derably thinner.

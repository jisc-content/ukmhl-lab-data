But as there are many subjects, which I have not hitherto enjoyed opportunities of investigating in this manner, to my own1 satisfaction, I have, when treating of these, se- lected the observations of those Anatomists, on whose accuracy I have felt inclined to place the most reliance. I trust, however, that, although it is only in these last instances, that I have thought it necessary to refer expressly to other Anatomical writers, I shall not be considered as pretending ignorance of what other Anatomists have done before me. There are very few situations, if indeed there be any, in which such an avowal on the part of an author, is either creditable or becoming. I have consulted all the Treatises and Elementary Books on Anatomy, which are usually thought worthy of perusal in our times; and have profited, as much as was in my power, by the information which they contain. Those who are familiar with the science, will readily perceive, wherein the present work differs from these, either in point of matter or arrangement. I have not ventured on many innovations in No- menclature, in the following pages ; but where inno- vation seemed to be unavoidable, I have uniformly ac-

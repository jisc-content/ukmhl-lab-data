THEIR STRUCTURE—NERVOUS FILAMENTS. 197 his experiments, and obtained precisely the same results. Nothing seems to me to have been added to our knowledge on this subject since his treatise. There is but one Nerve in the Body, the Olfactory Nerve, in which the Brown Species of Nervous Matter occurs ; in all the rest, it is of the Yellowish-White kind. This Matter does not seem to differ much from the Ner- vous Matter of the Central Mass. Its globules have always appeared to me of the same size*. According to Vauoue- lin, however, when treated chemically, as described p. 124, it yields much less Fatty Matter, and much more Albumen than the Nervous Matter of the Brain. But as the Neuri- lema does not seem to have been detached from the Nervous Matter in VAuauELiN’s analysis, some doubts may be en- tertained of its accuracy. The Filaments'!* of this substance, are of different sizes in different Nerves, and sometimes even in the same Nerve. They seldom exceed the thickness of a hair; and in most cases, are smaller than the finest fibre of silk or cotton, so that it requires a microscope to see them distinctly. They are placed side by side ; and, in their course, divide and subdivide, and reunite, and run into each other, form- ing the most intimate connection. The greater number of the Nerves in the Body, consist of several separate Bundles or Fascicidi j of these Filaments; some of only one Fasciculus. The Fasciculi, like the Filaments, are of various sizes. Some are more than an eighth of an inch thick, others scarcely more than a hundredth part of an inch. Some- • Prochaska (Oper. Min. I. 345.) and the Wenzels (De Penitior. Struct. &c. p. 37.) leave this doubtful; but the former rather thinks, that they are of the same magnitude. + By Fitamenti, I here mean, what Reil has distinguished by the term Ft la or Fibrillce. \ I mean by these terms, the Funcs or Chorda» of Reil. 3

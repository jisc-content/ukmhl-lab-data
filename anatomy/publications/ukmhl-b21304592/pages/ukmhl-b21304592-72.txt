40 PARTS COMPOSING THE SIDES OE THE HEART. â€¢f See Anatomy of Adipose Substance. The Anterior and lower sides of the Right Ventricle are thinner than the Septum, being only about a quarter of an inch thick, except opposite to some of the larger Fleshy Columns. The thinnest part is in the Anterior side, to- wards the base of the Upper Angle leading to the Pulmo- nary Artery. The posterior and inferior sides of the Left Ventricle, on the other hand, are thicker than the Septum. They are in most parts fully half an inch thick, and oppo- site the larger Columns a good deal more. The Heart is formed of the following Textures. In the first place, the whole external surface of the or- gan is covered by a Serous Membrane*, which is thickest and strongest on the Auricles. Under this, at particular parts, is a quantity of Adipose Substance or Fat t, which, shining through the Serous Membrane, gives the Heart a straw colour at these parts. But the extent of surface which the Fat covers, and the depth of the Stratum, vary exceedingly. In most in- stances the Auricles are without any ; but sometimes there are thin patches on their upper surface, and along the edg- es of the Lappets, and in the Right one, around the en- trance of the two Cavae. In general a ridge of it is found running round the side next the Ventricles of that groove which separates the Auricles and Ventricles externally ; ano- ther thinner layer occupies the whole of that furrow which distinguishes the Ventricles from each other on the upper and under surface of the Heart; and usually there is a little papilla of Adipose Substance, projecting from the Apex. Very often, too, there are borders of Fat seen extending from these larger strata, along the ramifications of the Blood- vessels Sometimes, the whole surface almost of the Ventri- cles is covered with a thick layer of it. * See Anatomy of Serous Membranes.

122 SUBSTANCE OF THE BRAIN. powerful microscopes did not enable him to discover any thing satisfactory. These microscopical observations have, within these few years, been prosecuted on a much more extensive scale, by Joseph and Charles Wenzel*; and these Anatomists have uniformly found, that the White Nervous Matter seemed as if entirely composed of extremely small globules, or corpuscules of a roundish form, putting on the appear- ance of little cells, filled with proper Medullary Substance. No estimate is given of the dimensions of the globules ; but they are described as being exceedingly minute, and as being all pretty nearly of the same size. They seemed to adhere closely to each other, and no fluid, or connecting medium, could be observed between them. The globular appearance continued distinctly perceptible, in portions of the substance, which had been long exposed to the action of rectified Spirit of Wine and Muriatic acid; nor was it even destroyed, by steeping the matter in Alcohol, and then drying it for several months. White Nervous Matter possesses considerable vascula- rity. The Arterial branches, however, which supply it, are seldom much larger in diameter than a common pin. Veins of an eighth of an inch in diameter are found Tun- ing through it, in some parts of the Brain ; but in general these vessels are as small as the Arteries. It is the division of small Bloodvessels, either transversely or longitudinally, which produces the appearance of red points and red stria, in this Matter, when incisions are made through it. When portions of it, too, are torn asun- der, Bloodvessels are drawn out between the separated sur- faces, in the form of red-coloured threads. * De Penitior. Struct. Cerebri, p. 24.

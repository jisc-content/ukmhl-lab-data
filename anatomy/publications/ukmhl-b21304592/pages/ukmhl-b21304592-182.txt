MEMBRANES OP THE BRAIN. 150 fifth of an inch, sending off one or two Ternary Strata, from each surface, and then dividing into three Secondary Strata, the upper of which, stretches upwards a little, the lower a little downwards, and the middle almost horizontally back- wards. From the posterior margin of the Lateral Part of the Central Mass in this section, a single Ternary Stratum is in general seen arising. Sometimes, however, it Is a small Primary one dividing into Ternary Strata. I could wish to have been able to have stated here, the results of some experiments, made with a view to ascertain what parts of the Brain are rendered fibrous by coagulation ; and, if possible, to discover whether there be any uniform connection between the fibres of different parts, when the whole organ is coagulated. But I have still a good many trials to make, before I can be satisfied as to either of these points. It has been affirmed of late years, by some Continental Anatomists, that a regular system of fibres may be shewn, even in an uncoagulated Brain, merely by laceration with the handle of a scalpel. This, however, I have always found to be impracticable* * * §. I cannot help suspecting, therefore, that these authors have been deceived, as to this point. Having thus described the Substance of the Brain, I pro- ceed to its Membranes. These I consider as two in numberf, the Pia Mater\, and the Arachnoid Membrane.§ • Rbu,, if I mistake not, found it so too. f I exclude the Dura Mater here, because it seems a more natural ar- rangement, to regard it as forming a part of the sides or walls of the Cranium. ♦ Synonyms.

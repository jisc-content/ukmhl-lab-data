I have never seen Bloodvessels in it, either in its healthy or diseased states, with or without injection; nor do I believe that they have yet been detected by any Anatomist. I have not at- tempted to inject its Absorbents, nor has any one, so far as I know, hitherto succeeded in demonstrating these, in a satisfactory manner. It is equally impracticable to demon- strate its Nerves. Bichat* classes it with the Serous Mem- branes ; and his reasons for this arrangement are certainly not without weight, in so far as they relate to its functions ; but the analogy between them, in point of structure, is far from having been established; and as the classification of the Membranes and other Common Textures is, or ought to be, founded entirely on Anatomical characters, I prefer, in the meanwhile, to regard the Arachnoid Membrane, as of a peculiar structure. The connection betwixt this Membrane and the Pia Ma- ter is in most places very close, as we have already had oc- casion to remark when speaking of the latter; and yet it is impossible to discover any connecting medium between them, except Bloodvessels. Even where they are separated to a considerable distance from each other, the slender, white, filaments, which appear between them, may be only long and delicate ramifications of Arteries or Veins. Its particular distribution is easily described. It pas- ses accross from the top of one Convolution to another, adhering closely to the Pia Mater, over the whole outer and upper surface of each Hemisphere of the Brain Pro- per. Along the border of these Hemispheres, next the Longitudinal Fissure, it is perforated, at various points, by the Veins already described entering the Longitudinal Sinus of the Dura Mater. In the same manner it covers the Con- volutions on the sides of this Fissure, as far down as the

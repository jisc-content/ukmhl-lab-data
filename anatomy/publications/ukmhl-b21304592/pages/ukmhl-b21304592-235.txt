THEIR CLASSIFICATION. 203 Of the Spinal Nerves there are sixty-eight, forming thir- ty-four corresponding Pairs. These are the following. The Glosso-Pharyvgcal Nerves. The Pneumo-Gastric Nerves *. The Hypo-Glossal Nerves -J*. The Accessory Nerves j. The Sub-Occipital Nerves ||. The Cervical Nerves.—Seven Pairs. The Dorsal Nerves.—Twelve Pairs. The Lumbar Nerves.—Five Pairs. The Sacral Nerves.—Five Pairs. Let us now attend to the Origins of each of these Primary Nerves separately. Origins of the Cerebral Nerves. Origins of the Olfactory Nerves. The Olfactory Nerve, on each side, arises from that py- ramidal Eminence on the lower surface of the Anterior Lobe of the Brain Proper, already minutely described, (p. 87.) * Synonyms. The Eighth Pair of the old enumeration. Lat. Par Va- gum ; Nervi Vagi. Fr. Les Nerfs Vocaux. The name Pneumo-Gastric, which I have chosen for these Nerves, is adopted from Chaussier. It seems to me preferable to a translation of Nervi Vagi, viz. the Wandering Nerves ; and also to the appellation of Vocal Nerves, which would imply a greatly more limited distribution than they really have. I have sometimes called them the Gastro -pulmonary Nerves. f Synonym. Fr. Les Nerfs Linguaux. J These Nerves have derived their name, from having been described by the older Anatomists as Accessory Nerves to the Eighth Pair. Different French writers have called them, Les Nerfs Spinaux; Les Nerfs Spino-cranio-tra- peziens; Les Nerfs Trachelo-dorsaux. [j These Nerves have been arranged by many Anatomists among the Cer- vical Nerves; of which they then form the First Pair. There is no advan- tage, however, in this arrangement; and by adopting that in the text, the num- ber of the Cervical Nerves is made to correspond exactly with the number of the Cervical Vertebrae, which is very convenient.

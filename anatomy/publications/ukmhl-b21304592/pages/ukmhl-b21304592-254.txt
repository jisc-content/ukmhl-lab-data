222 CELLULAR SUBSTANCE IN CENEKAL. On the closest examination of the fine lamina: which ap- pear, on the distention of this Substance, nothing can be seen composing them, but transparent, and colourless, fibres, of the utmost delicacy. Small Bloodvessels may almost al- ways be perceived, after injection, running in great abun- dance between the lamina and through the cells ; and there is no Texture in the Body, in which Absorbent Vessels are so often perceptible; though their minute beginnings may not be easily demonstrable. Delicate ramifications of Nerves may be traced through it, in most parts where it is accumulated in considerable quantity. When macerated for some time in cold water, it acquires a white colour, and a flocculent or downy appearance; and it becomes a little more elastic than before. By long boiling in water, it may be entirely dissolved; and the solution contains Albumen and Gelatine. In young persons, this Texture is move delicate than in the Adult, and exists in much smaller proportion. In old persons, there is not only less of it, in general, diffused throughout the body, but its laminae seem less extensible, and somewhat more opaque*. * Bordeu has written a little volume upon this Texture, which he has call- ed ‘ Le Tissu Muqueux.’ (Recherches sur le Tissu Muqueux, &c.) A single page, however, would have comprehended all his remarks upon it, that are accurate* Bichat’s Chapter on the same Texture, in his ‘ Anatomie Generale,’ (Tom. I. p. 11.) is filled with matter which is not only quite foreign to the subject, but often vague, and often incorrect. By far the best, as well as the most original essay on the Anatomy of the Cellular Substance, is that by Dr. William Hunter, in the Medical Qbser-- vations and Inquiries, Vol II. It is quite worthy of his great talents.

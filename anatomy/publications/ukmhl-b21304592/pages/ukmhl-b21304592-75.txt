THE MUSCULAR COAT.â€”INNER MEMBRANE. 4ii so that many of them seem to pass over the groove, and to be continued from the one Ventricle to the other. Along the Inferior Furrow, the course ol the fibres on each side, does not correspond so nearly; accordingly they are dis- tinctly seen intersecting each other. The second or middle stratum consists of fibres which in- tersect each other in every direction. The fibres of the third or innermost layer, seem to fol- low exactly the direction of the ridges and Fleshy Columns seen on the inner surface of the Ventricles, of winch they constitute the greatest part. In the Septum, there are two layers similar to the last of these three, one corresponding to each Ventricle; and be- tween these a stratum similar to the second or middle one. Within the Muscular Coat, and lining the whole inner surface of the Cavities of the Heart, is found what is deno- minated the Inner Membrane. In the Ventricles, this membrane is as thin almost as the fibres of cotton, perfectly transparent, and without the slight- est appearance of fibres. Neither Bloodvessels, Absorbents, nor Nerves, have yet been seen in it. Maceration in water, renders it slightly opaque. It is easily detached from the Muscular Fibres which it lines; but no intervening Cellular Substance, or such like medium of connection, can be seen between them. It is too tender to admit of being peeled off in large patches. Towards the tops of those ridges or Fleshy Columns which give rise to the Tendinous Cords, it is somewhat thicker and more opaque than at other parts. In the Right Auricle, the Inner Membrane which lines the Fleshy Cords is quite similar to that in the Ventricles ; but at all other parts of this Auricle, and over the whole of the Left, it has a different appearance. It is white and se- mi-transparent, and considerably thicker and stronger than the Serous Membrane. After slight maceration, it is dis-

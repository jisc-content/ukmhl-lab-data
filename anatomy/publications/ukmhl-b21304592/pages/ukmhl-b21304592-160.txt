ST7BSTANCE OP THE BRAIN. 129 deal of its brownish tinge. Alcohol, Acids, and Solutions of Corrosive Sublimate, while they increase its consistence, also render it whiter. Of these, the Corrosive Sublimate has most influence on its colour. * Its chemical properties, when unmixed with the White species, have not yet been investigated. Of these two kinds, then, of Nervous Matter, almost the whole Substance of the Brain is composed: They are inter- mingled in various ways. In some parts, a covering of the one surrounds a mass of the other, as a capsule encloses a nucleus ; in others, they are alternated in lamina or strata ; and in others, they traverse each other, in the form of cords or fibres, of various sizes. Yet notwithstanding this diver- sity in their arrangement in different parts, their disposition in each particular part, is observed to be remarkably uni- form. The proportions and arrangement, therefore, of the two kinds of Nervous Matter, in the different regions of the Brain, form an important part of the Anatomy of this organ. It is not my intention, however, to enter minutely into this subject at present. It would be difficult to communi- cate an accurate idea of the disposition of these two kinds of Matter by words, even if the limits of the different parts of the Brain were precisely fixed. But although Anatomists describe, on the surface of this organ, vai'ious eminences, such as Peduncles, and Commissures, and Corpora, they have traced merely the superficial boundaries of these eleva- tions ; leaving their more internal or central limits altoge- ther undefined. This, it is obvious, must render mere verbal description, without the aid of coloured engravings, altogether inadequate to convey a minute knowledge, of the arrangement of the two species of Nervous Matter within. On the present occasion, therefore, I shall content myself

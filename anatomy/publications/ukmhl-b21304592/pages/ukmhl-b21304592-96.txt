64 VEINS IN GENERAL. Arterial System, however, as has been already remarked, the reunion of branches so as to form a trunk, is very rare. The Venous trunks of middling size, throughout the Bo- dy, are both more numerous and longer, than the Arterial Vessels of the same diameter. In general, too, it is very ap- parent, that, whether arising from the greater diameter, or length or number of the branches, the combined area of all the Veins of a part, is greater than the combined area of all its Arteries. It is obvious, therefore, that the area of the whole Venous System must be greater than that of the Arterial. Haller* is inclined to think, that the ratio is about as nine to four; and this, probably, is as near the truth, as it is possible to arrive, in a point where the elements of the cal- culation are so various and so difficult to be ascertained. Veins, like Arteries, are whitish and flocculent without, and smooth and pale coloured within. Many of the larger Veins, and those of middling size, are pi’ovided with Valves. These are Membranes of a se- milunar or parabolic shape, perfectly transparent and co- lourless, and though scarcely the thickness of a hair, yet very dense and strong. They are attached by the whole of their curved margin to the inner surface of the Vein; and this margin is uniformly turned towards the branches of the Vein, while their free, straight, edge, looks towards the trunks. They are inserted into the sides of the Vein in such a manner, as to be in a certain degree loose within the tube; and accordingly when any fluid is forced from the trunks towards the branches, they are pushed away from the sides of the Vessel, and pressed inwards towards its axis. They vary very much in their dimensions, even in Vessels of the same caliber. Sometimes they occur sin- gle, particularly in the smaller Vessels; sometimes, though very rarely, three are found together; but in general they • Elem. Physiol. I. p. 133.

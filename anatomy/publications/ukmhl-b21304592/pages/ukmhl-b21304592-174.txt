142 SUBSTANCE OP THE BE AIN. of the Protuberance. Whether there be any of them that do not reach the top of the Protuberance, but only pene- trate a certain way into it; or whether some do not begin at the top of the Protuberance and stretch only a certain distance downward; or lastly, whether there may not be some which are neither connected with the top nor bottom, I have not yet been able to satisfy myself. I have never seen any of them situated nearer to the Median Plane than a tenth of an inch; so that they are completely divided in- to two sets, one on the right side and another on the left. Laterally, however, they extend as far as the outer boun- dary of the Protuberance. Some of them, particularly to- wards the lower part, and one close to the boundary of the Protuberance behind, seem to stretch from the outside in- wards in one continued plane; others are so narrow and so often interrupted, that they have more the appearance of fibres than strata. In point of thickness, those towards the forepart exceed the layers in the middle and behind; some of the former being a sixth of an inch thick nearly, while the middle ones are as thin as hairs, and those behind scarce- ly more than a fifteenth or a twelfth of an inch. These two kinds of White Matter are closely interwoven throughout the whole Protuberance; and it is only at a very few points that there is any appearance of Brown Matter. Even in these few points, the quantity of it is so small, that it is just perceptible and no more. The substance immediately continuous with the Annular Protuberance behind, and forming the anterior surface of the Central Fissure of the Cerebellum, is composed of mat- ter which is rather Reddish-White than Yellowish-White. A plate of Yellowish-White matter, however, runs through it exactly in the Median Plane, continuous with the layer of White Matter, in the same situation, in the Annular Pro- tuberance.

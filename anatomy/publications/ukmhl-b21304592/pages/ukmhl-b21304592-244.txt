THE NERVES IN GENERAL. 212 It consists at its Origin of from ten to twenty Filaments, or delicate Fasciculi of Filaments, which spring from the Cord in three or four sets or bundles, placed one above the other in a row. These extend outwards and a little for- wards, behind the Basilar Artery, and gradually converge so as to form one Fasciculus, about half an inch from the Cord, which immediately perforates the Arachnoid Mem- brane. Each of the rootlets or first bundles of Fasciculi is em- braced by Pia Mater ; and the Nerve which they form by their union, is about a twelfth of an inch thick and a little flattened. Origins of the Accessory Nerves. The Accessory Nerve arises, on each side, by a series of Filaments, or delicate Fasciculi of Filaments, from the late- ral surface of the Top and Cervical Portion of the Spinal Cord. There is considerable variety in the point at which the first of these Filaments arises below ; but, in general, it is within half an inch of the termination of the Cervical Por- tion. From this, they continue to arise, one above the other, in a row, as far up as the Origin of the Pneumo-gastric Nerve; and uniting successively with each other, they at last form a round Nerve, about a twentieth of an inch in thickness. The line from which they spring, however, does not correspond exactly to the middle of the lateral surface of the Cord, but is a little posterior to it. The number of the Fasciculi or Filaments is various; sometimes they are more numerous on one side than on the other. They seem to me, to be most numerous, in general, opposite the Top of the Cord. I have counted fourteen or fifteen, arising within the space, between the Pneumo-gastric and Sub-occipital Nerves.

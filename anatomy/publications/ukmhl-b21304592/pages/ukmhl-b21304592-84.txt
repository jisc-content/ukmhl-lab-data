THE HEART BEFORE AND AFTER MATURITY. .52 * Traits, &c. I. p. 227. we have described, until about the commencement of the ninth month; when a remarkable change begins to take place in them. The Valve not only becomes gradually tighter, and its floating edge, of course, shorter, but its in- sertion approaches nearer and nearer to the maiâ€™gin of the Oval Hole; until, at the period of Birth, the attachment of the Valve corresponds almost exactly to the edge of the Hole; the Valve is stretched tight across the Hole like the parchment of a drum; and a small oblique Slit only is left at the upper end, by which the Auricles still communicate with each other. The anterior surface of the Valve now forms the bottom of the Oval Fossa described in the Adult Heart. In the course of a few months after Birth, the Slit at its .upper part diminishes so as only to admit the point of a probe, and in this state, it would seem, in general, to remain for the whole of after life, as was formerly remarked; though cer- tainly, in a great many instances it is entirely closed. The Eustachian Valve is subject to as much variety al- most in point of size, in the Foetal, as in the Adult Heart; in general, however, it is larger proportionally. That the cavities of the Auricles in the Foetus, are larger, in proportion to the Ventricles, than in the Adult, is obvious to the eye; and this, no doubt, arises from the greater size of the Tips of the Auricles in the former. But the com- parative capacities of the cavities on the Right and on the Left side at this period are not so easily ascertained. Senac* says that those on the Right are larger, as in the Adult; and that about the sixth or seventh month, the Right Ventricle is even twice as large as the Left; but this is cer- tainly incorrect. I confess they have generally appeared to me to be pretty nearly alike in point of size; or if there

72 Anatomy of the Absorbing Vessels, p. 66. ABSORBENT VESSELS IN GENERAL. Veins ; but, in proportion to their thickness, they are equal- ly strong ; and they have precisely the same form, and mode of attachment to the inside of the Vessel.' They are gene- rally found in pairs. Sometimes where a large branch runs into a trunk, or where a trunk opens into a Vein, there is only a single Valve. Three are never found together. The two Valves of a pair are usually of the same size; but I suspect that they are never so perfectly adapted to each other, or to the caliber of the Vessel in which they are placed, as entirely to prevent such fluids as air or mer- cury, from passing from the t»unk towards the branches. I have never seen an Absorbent Vessel, in which I could not, by means of a steel syringe, force quicksilver in this direc- tion, without any apparent injury to the Valves. At all events, the resistance which they oppose to fluids passing towards the branches, seems to be considerably less in the capillary, than in the large vessels. Opposite to each Valve, the Absorbents swell out a little, as the Veins do ; and it is to this they chiefly owe their notch- ed or jointed appearance. These notches enable us to as- certain the existence of Valves, in Absorbents which are too minute to admit of being easily dissected. In Absorbent Vessels of middling size, a pair of Valves will be found at every twentieth of an inch almost. Towards the larger branches and trunks, they are somewhat less fre- quent ; and towards the capillary branches, rather more. According to Cruiksiiaxk*, however, there is great va- riety in the distribution of the Valves, in different bodies. « The Thoracic Duct, for example,11 says he, “ in some bo- dies, has perhaps only three or four pair of Valves: in others, I have seen it crowded with Valves throughout its whole length. I have seen a lymphatic vessel run six inches, with- out a single Valve appearing in its cavity. Sometimes the

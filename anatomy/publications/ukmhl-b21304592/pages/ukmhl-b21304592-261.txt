229 MUSCLE IN GENERAL. uot to admit of accurate examination. I imagine, however, that it is of the same nature as the rest; very delicate fila- ments, at least, like those seen in Cellular Substance, are always perceived between the finer Fasciculi of Muscle, when they are gently separated from each other. The Bloodvessels of Muscular Texture admit of easy injection in all parts of the Body. In Muscle which is com- posed of large Fasciculi, their ramifications may be traced to a considerable degree of minuteness between these, al- ways accompanying the different sheaths of Cellular Sub- stance. In what manner, however, the extremities of the Arteries and commencements of the Veins, are disposed with respect to the Primary Fibres, is not known. Absorbent Vessels have occasionally been injected, on the surfaces of certain portions of Muscle in the Body; but they have not hitherto been traced far between the Fasciculi. Nerves may often be followed, by dissection, to a great degree of minuteness between the Fasciculi. They ramify in the Cellular Substance like the Arteries; and after a number of subdivisions corresponding to the different orders of Fasciculi, terminate at last, in all probability, in the sub- stance of the Primary Fibre. This, however, is merely con- jecture. When thin slices of Muscle are exposed to a stream of dry air, they become brownish, semi-transparent, and very tough. When plunged into cold water, on the other hand, if the water be regularly renewed, Muscle loses its rednes, entirely, the Fibrous part remaining of a straw colour. The whole Texture, too, swells out in consequence of the maceration, and gradually becomes softer. Alcohol, diluted Acids, Corrosive Sublimate, Alumn, Common Salt, Nitrate of Potass, increase the consistence of Muscle, contract it slightly, promote its separation into Primary Fibres, and affect its colour variously. The first three render it paler; Alumn gives it a greater degree of 3

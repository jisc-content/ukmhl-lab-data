MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. 162 off innumerable small twigs, to the Pia Mater lining the Triangular Furrow between the Peduncules of the Brain 1 roper; similar small branches to the Choroid Plexus in the Inferior Ilorns of the Lateral Ventricles ; a branch of considerable size, which turning backwards and upwards round the Peduncles of the Brain Proper, is ramified chief- ly on the Choroid Membrane and Plexus, and the Pia Ma- ter covering the Corpora Bigemina; and numerous branches of various sizes, to the inferior surfaces of the Middle Lobes, and the inferior, inner, and outer surfaces of the Posterior Lobes. At about half an inch from their origin, they re- ceive the Communicating Branch of the Internal Carotid ; and thus by means of these Vessels, and of the Anterior Ar- teries of the Brain Proper with their Communicating Branch, an Arterial Circle is formed, which has been denominated the Circle of Willis. The Arteries of the Pia Mater derived from the Verte- brals, are the two Large Inferior Cerebellar Arteries, one on each side. We shall have occasion to describe the origin of these, and their course with respect to the top of the Spinal Cord, afterwards. It is sufficient to observe here, that they join the Cerebellum generally towards the upper and outer part of the Spinal Lobules, and thence wind along the In- ferior Lobes, and the inferior surface of the Posterior Lobes. Besides the branches which they send outwards and backwards in this course, they supply all the parts in the Spinal Fossa, and in the Median Fossa which is conti- nuous with it. The capillary Veins of the Brain, unite, in the Pia Ma- ter, into a series of Venous Trunks, all of which terminate in the Sinuses of the Dura Mater. The small Veins from the upper, convex, surface, and the inner, flat, or median, surface, of each Hemisphere of the Brain Proper, and from the lower surface of each Anterior Lobe, usually unite into ten or twelve Venous Trunks, which

ORIGINS OF THE CEREBRAL NERVES. 209 ter. Fifty or sixty of these, may be easily counted with the naked eye. At their very Origin they always form two dis- tinct sets or bundles. The upper bundle, which, in gene- ral, is not more than a fifth of the size of the lower one, consists commonly of from two to six Fasciculi, which arise from the superior surface of the Peduncle of the Cerebellum. The lower bundle, comprehending all the remaining Fasci- culi of the Nerve, arises from the anterior surface of the Peduncle, immediately under the Origin of the former. The two bundles, directly after this Origin, run together into one, the upper one occupying the upper and inner margin of the Nerve ; and their union is so close, that the little ridge usually intervening between their Origins, (seep. 117.) is completely concealed. Not unfrequently, however, this ridge also gives off a few Fasciculi, thus connecting the two bundles together. Origins of the Facial Nerves. The Facial Nerve arises, on each side, from the lower- most point of the anterior surface of the Peduncle of the Cerebellum, close to its junction with the Annular Protu- berance. (See p. 117.) It extends outwards, forwards, and a little upwards, for about half an inch, and perforates the Arachnoid Membrane, opposite the inner extremity of the Peduncular Fossa. It is of a round shape, and nearly a twelfth of an inch thick; and consists, from its very Origin, of fine Fasciculi of Filaments, with a Neurilema of Pia Mater. Very often too, it is joined by four or five very delicate Fasciculi, which arise from the Peduncle, about a thirtieth of an inch above and behind it. VOL. i

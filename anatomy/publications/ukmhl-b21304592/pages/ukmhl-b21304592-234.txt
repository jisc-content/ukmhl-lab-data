202 THE NEBVES IN GENERAL. The Cerebral Nerves are sixteen in number, forming eight corresponding Pairs. These are the following *. The Olfactory Nerves. The Optic Nerves. The Common Oculo-Muscular Nerves *f* * §. The Internal Oculo-Muscular Nerves J. The External Oculo-Muscular Nerves §. The Trigeminal Nerves ||. The Facial Nerves If. The Auditory Nerves **. The three first of these arise from the Brain Proper, and the remaining five from the Cerebellum ; so that if the sub- division were of any utility, they might be arranged into Cerebral-Proper and Cerebellar Nerves. * I have purposely forborn tofapply any numerical appellations to these Nerves, or to those which arise from the top of the Spinal Cord. It is now more than thirty years, since the old Nomenclature, founded on this principle, was ad- mitted by all sound Anatomists to be entirely inaccurate, and was rejected by Vica d’Azyr. (Traited’Anatomie, p. 48.) The new enumeration, too, which has been proposed in its place, although correct in other respects, seems to me objectionable, on account of the general classification to which it is sub- servient. It is better, therefore, I apprehend, to drop both enumerations entirely ; and to confine ourselves to appellations implying something rela- tive to the distribution of the Nerves. This, fortunately, can be done, in the present instance, without any inconvenience; as all of these Nerves have long had names of this kind applied to them, which are familiar to Anatomists, and almost all of which may be retained. -j- Synonym.

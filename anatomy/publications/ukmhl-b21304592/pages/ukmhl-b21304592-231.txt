199 THEIR STRUCTURE—NEURILEMA. silver, shewing all the little canals in which the Filaments of Nervous Matter were contained, and all the bundles of these, which were united into Fasciculi. The small Arterial Vessels which supply the larger Nerves, seem to observe a pretty uniform mode of distribution. Pe- netrating the outer sheath of the Nerve at various points, they subdivide into two sets of branches, one of which runs upwards and the other downwards, parallel to the Fasciculi, and between them ; these subdivide in the same manner, and are distributed between the smaller Fasciculi; and these again subdividing, are ramified upon the fine canaliculi which inclose the Filaments, and thence penetrate into the sub- stance of the Filaments themselves. Reil has represented this distribution very beautifully. It may be presumed that the Arteries are distributed in all Nerves, pretty much in the same manner. Veins are often seen in great abundance on the surface of Nerves, filled with Blood which had col- lected in them at the period of Death; but they are not so easily injected as the Arteries. Their Absorbents are hard- ly perceptible, except occasionally on the surface of the lar- gest Nerves. The Neurilema of the Primary Nerves, as long as these remain within the cavities of the Cranium or Spine, obvious- ly consists of Pia Mater. The Optic Nerves are peculiar, in having their general, external, sheath, composed of a sub- stance, possessing the structure of Tendon. A good deal still remains to be investigated respecting the structure of the Ganglia. Meantime it seems to me, that Scarpa’s description and representations of them, are by far the most accurate which we possess *. They are bodies, in which the Fasciculi of Nervous Fila- ments attached to them, suffer a temporary subdivision and separation from each other, and are then combined anew. A • Anatom. Annotat. Lib.

230 MUSCLE IN' GENERAL. toughness than any of the rest, and usually changes its co- lour to brown ; Nitrate of Fotass and Common Salt make it more florid in its hue; and although they render it some- what firmer at first, this effect seems gradually to go off, and it becomes softer or more tender; its decomposition, however, being at same time retarded. I do not find that the Chemical Properties of Muscle in the Human Body, have hitherto been particularly investi- gated. Numerous and very minute analyses, however, have been made of this Texture in Quadrupeds; a full account of which will be found, in all the Elementary Works on Chemistry*. From the close resemblance which subsists be- tween this substance in Man and in these Animals, there can be no doubt, that when Human Muscle is submitted to the same operations, similar results will be obtained. In all probability, it will be found, 1. That after it has been long exposed to the action of boiling water, it yields to the water a quantity of Albumen, Gelatin, the Extractive Mat- ter described by Thouvenel, and a little Phosphat of Soda and of Ammonia; and that the fibrous substance which re- mains undissolved, possesses all the properties of Fibrin; 2. That when a portion of Muscle is calcined, it leaves about 5 per cent, its weight of Saline Matter, composed chiefly of Phosphates of Soda, Ammonia, and Lime, and Carbonat of Lime. There are various portions of Muscle in the Body, which are smaller, in general, in the Female than in the Male; but whether this depends, in any degree, on an actual dif- rence in the diameter of the Primary Fibres, has not been ascertained. In other respects, this Texture seems to be the same in both Sexes \ * , * See in particular, Murray’s System of Chemistry, IV. p. 615 ; Thomson s System of Chemistry, V. p. 522; Henry’s Elements of Chemistry, II. p. 304. •

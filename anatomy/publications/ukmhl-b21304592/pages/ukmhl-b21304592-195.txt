PIA MATER—ITS VENOUS TRUNKS. 163 ©pen into the Upper Median, or Longitudinal Sinus, of the Dura Mater. The course of these Veins is over the con- vex surface of the Hemispheres, towards their upper and inner margins, along which, they penetrate the Sinus. They occupy chiefly the tops of the Fossae between the Convolu- tions, and at their entrance into the Sinus, have, most of them, a slight inclination forwards. Those in the middle incline most. They seldom or never correspond exactly, either in their course or their dimensions, in the opposite Hemispheres. They are small towards the Anterior Lobe, and largest about the middle of each Hemisphere. The largest is about a sixth of an inch in diameter, the smallest about a tenth. The capillary Veins from the lower, anterior, and inner surfaces, of each of the Middle Lobes of the Brain Proper, usually unite into three or four small Trunks, which open, one of them sometimes into the anterior part of the Lateral Sinus of the Dura Mater on the corresponding side, the other two or three, always into the anterior part of the Cavernous Sinus. The capillary Veins from the lower surface of each Pos- terior Lobe of the Brain Proper, uniting with a few from the outer, convex, surface, of the same, form, in general, four small Trunks, which penetrate the upper side of the Late- ral Sinus of the Dura Mater, at equal distances from each other. The delicate Venous Vessels of the Choroid Membrane and Plexus, unite successively with each other, to form two Trunks, denominated the Galenian Veins. The general di- rection of these, is from the apex of the Choroid Membrane to its posterior margin, close to the Median Line. They form a part of this Membrane. They are both pretty near- ly of the same size ; and beginning small before, gradually enlarge as they proceed backwards, until, at their termina- tion, they are usually about an eighth of an inch in diame- 2

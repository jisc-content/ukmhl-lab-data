134 substance of the brain. * De Corp. Human. Fab. IV. p. 63. is continued across from the prominences on one side to those on the other, forming the Connecting Plate of those Bodies and the Frenulum. But the surface of this Plate, and of the Corpora, looking towards the Aqueduct of Sylvius, is lined with a fine coating of a matter having a somewhat redder hue. The remaining parts of the Cor- pora Bigemina, appear to be composed of a substance inter- mediate in colour between Yellowish-White and Wood- Brown, and rather firmer in its consistence than common Nervous Matter. I have sometimes seen, running through the middle of this substance in the Upper Corpus Bigemi- num, a thin stratum of a paler coloured matter, which seemed to be continuous with the Posterior Commissure of the Brain Proper before, and formed a slight concavity downwards. Two white Laminae were formerly described (p. 97.) as connected with the base of the Pineal Gland; an upper one, continued at each extremity into the ridges called the Pe- duncles of this Gland, and a lower, usually denominated the Posterior Commissure of the Brain Proper. Both of these are composed of Orange-White Matter. The latter extends outvyards into the substance of the Thalamus Opti- cus, on each side, for about a twelfth of an inch. The Pineal Gland itself, is composed of two substances. The substance of which there is most, seems to be a spe- cies of Brown Nervous Matter ; only it is softer in its con- sistence than that matter generally is: The other substance is in the form of small particles like grains of sand, very hard, semitransparent, of a yellowish colour, and varying a little in size, but never larger than the head of a pin. Some- times these particles are grouped together upon the upper surface of the Gland, close to its base, making a little Acer- vulus, as Soemmerring * has called it; at other times they form a sort of chain or ridge along its margin; and at other

THE MITRAL VALVE.â€”ARTERIAL ORIFICE. 3? One Flap of the Valve is attached to the anterior half of the margin of the Auricular Orifice, and lies towards the anterior edge of the cavity of the Ventricle; the other arises from the posterior half of the Auricular Orifice, and looks towards the posterior edge of the cavity. Their bases are of nearly equal length ; but the Anterior Flap projects fully twice as far into the Ventricle, or is twice as long, as the Posterior. Tendinous Cords like those of the Tricuspid Valve, and arising from the Fleshy Columns just described, are insert- ed into the whole margin of the Mitral Valve, and several into its outer surface. They are considerably thicker than than those in the Right Ventricle, and in proceeding to their attachment do not branch off into so many smaller threads. From eight to ten in general arise from the extremity of the Fleshy Column which springs from the upper side of the Ventricle, and these are inserted into the upper edge of each of the Flaps, and partly into their outer surface. From ten to twelve arise in a similar manner from the low- er Fleshy Column, and are inserted into the lower margin of each of the Valves, and some also into their outer sur- face. These Tendinous Cords, like those belonging to the Tri- cuspid Valve, are too short to allow the Flaps to be folded towards the Auricular Orifice, when the Ventricle is in a distended state; but if we divide the Cords, and then pull the Flaps towards the Auricle, we shall find that they are more than sufficient to shut up this orifice completely. In the base of the cavity on the fore-part of the Auricular Orifice, and concealed, in the distended state of the Ven- tricle, by the Anterior Flap of the Mitral Valve, there is a smooth surface leading to a circular opening, which looks to the right, and a little upwards and forwards. This is called the Arterial Orifice pf the Ventricle ; and from it the A.prta a

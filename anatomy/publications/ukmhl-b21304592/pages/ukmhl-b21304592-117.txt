LOWER SURFACE OF THE DRAIN PROPER. 85 Behind this, and about half an inch higher up, the pos- terior extremity of the Corpus Callosum appears; from which, the Longitudinal Fissure is seen extending back- wards to the posterior margin of the Brain. Such are the appearances on the Median Line of the lower surface of the Brain Proper. On each side of the Median Line, we have to remark, in the first place, the Lobes of each Hemisphere. These are three in number, and are denominated the Anterior, Middle, and Posterior. Their surfaces are formed into Convolutions, similar in colour to those on the upper surface of the Hemispheres, but upon the whole, rather smaller and less serpentine, and having much shallower Fosses between them. The Anterior Lobe is the largest. It generally ex- tends as far back as one half of the Hemisphere; sometimes, nearly two thirds. Close to the Longitudinal Fissure, it is formed into a sort of Ridge, and projects considerably far- ther downwards than the parts more to the outside, which are slightly concave and look a little outwards. This Ridge is formed by two Convolutions placed parallel to each other and to the Median Line; and in the surface of the Fossa between these, the Olfactory Nerve is always found The Middle Lobe is next in point of size. It is convex on the outer and lower surfaces, and partly convex, partly concave, above and on the inside. Its inner margin is divided into two portions, anterior and posterior, by a part which projects more inwards than the rest, and which I should be inclined to call its Inner Lobule. The portion of the inner margin behind this Lobule, is always formed by a single Convolution, which arising im- mediately behind the posterior extremity of the Corpus Callosum, runs downwards and forwards, closely applied to the Peduncle of the Brain Proper, and is then lost in the 3

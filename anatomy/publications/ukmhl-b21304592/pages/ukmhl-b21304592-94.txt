C>2 THE VETftS IN GENERAL. OF THE VEINS. The distribution of the Venous System, like that of the Arterial, may be compared to the ramification of a tree. In describing this System, however, it is usual to invert the order observed in the former, and to consider the trunks, as successively formed by the union of the branches. All the Veins of the Body, therefore, are said to arise from the minute capillary branches of the Arteries, and uniting one with another, to form, at last, seven principal trunks. Three of these, the two Cavae and the Coronary Vein, open into the Right Auricle of the Heart; and the other four, viz. the two Right, and the two Left Pulmonary Veins, open into the Left Auricle. The Coronary Vein, at its entrance into the Auricle, is about a third of an inch in diameter, the Inferior Cava about an inch, the Superior about two thirds of an inch, and the four Pulmonary Veins about half an inch each. The Veins in general, throughout the Body are, like the Arteries, of a cylindrical shape ; but they deviate from this form, much more frequently than the Arteries do. They often swell out into sinuses ; and small swellings of this sort are so constant, in all those Veins which are provided with certain Valves afterwards to be described, that where these Valves are numerous, the Vessel puts on a knotted appear- ance. The commencements of the Veins are, every where, so mi- nute, that they are seldom perceptible by the naked eye. The same means must be employed to bring them into view, as is necessary in tracing the terminations of the ca- pillary Arteries. When wre apply the microscope, then, to a part properly injected, we can distinctly trace every capillary Vein which is visible, into some corresponding capillary Artery. All

In a child at Birth they observ- ed, that the White Nervous Matter was reddish from the number of its Vessels, and the Brown was very pale. In an infant of eight weeks, they perceived the two kinds of Mat- ter, but the difference between them was very slight. Their observations on this Matter in old age, correspond with those of other Anatomists; both species of it become darker in colour, but the Brown in particular, in proportion as the individual advances in years. They have entered into some very minute details, as to the state of the Nervous Matter, in different portions of the Brain, at different periods of Life; but for these, I must refer the reader to the work itself*. On the subject of the Granulations of the Pia Mater, they observe, that there is not the slightest appearance of these bodies previous to Birth. They are generally found between birth and the seventh year, though there are al- ways fewer of them at this period than in the Adult. When they happened to be wanting altogether, which, however, is very seldom, the deficiency generally occurs before the third year -f*. OF THE SPINAL CORD|. From a few measurements which I have made of this prolongation, I am inclined to think, that its length, in a a person of the average stature, is generally about thirty inches. Its thickness is different at different parts; but it â€¢ De Penitior, &c. p. 300. 326, f Same book, &c. p. 290. J Synonyms. Spinal Marrow. Fr. Le Prolongement Rachktien.

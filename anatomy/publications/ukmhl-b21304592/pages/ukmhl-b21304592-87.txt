55 THEIR MODE OE DISTRIBUTION. * Traite, &c. I. p 244. agree with Senac*, that it is absurd to attempt ascertaining it with precision. It seems to vary in almost every instance. The angles formed by Arterial branches and their trunks, are of all sorts. The acute angle, however, is the most com- mon, and the obtuse the rarest. Two arteries, derived from different trunks, often meet and are lost in each other; and this kind of connection is called Inosculation or Anastomosis. Sometimes, though rarely, instead of simply passing in- to each other, they form a new trunk by their union. After the Arteries have ramified to a certain degree of minuteness, they become so thin and transparent, that it is impossible to see them either with the naked eye or with the microscope. Sometimes, indeed, particularly in trans- parent parts, when the Blood happens to stagnate in them, after Death, we can trace them a little farther than when they are empty; but this does not often happen. In order, therefore, to render these minute capillary branches of the Arterial System visible, we are obliged to inject into them, through the larger trunks, some thin coloured fluid, such as a weak solution of glue mixed with Vermilion; and from injections of this sort, all our knowledge of the ultimate ra- mifications of the Arteries has been derived. These ramifications are, of course, always best seen, in parts which are naturally transparent; but they may often be traced, also, to a very great degree of minutenes, on the surface of opaque parts, or in thin slices of these parts, ren- dered transparent by drying. The varieties in the mode of their distribution, which we thus discover, depending on differences in the number, or length, or diameter, or curvature, or connexion of their little branches, are almost infinite. Every different Tex- ture in the Body seems to have a mode of distribution of its own.

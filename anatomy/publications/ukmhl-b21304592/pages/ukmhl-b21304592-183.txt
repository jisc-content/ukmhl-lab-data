V PI A MATERâ€”ITS STRUCTURE. 151 The Pia Mater is the more internal of the two. It em- braces immediately the whole external surface of the Sub- stance of the Brain, and extends into certain parts of its Central Fissures. It varies very much in thickness, and strength, and ge- neral appearance, in different parts. In some parts, it is more than an eighth of an inch in thickness, in others, thin- ner than the finest hair. In certain situations, it is as delicate almost as cob-web ; in others, loose and spongy ; and in others again, exceedingly dense and firm, although thin. In some parts, it looks like a very fine net-work; in others, it has all the appearance of a Membrane of very close texture. At most parts, its outer surface is so intimately united with the Arachnoid Membrane, that it is impossible to separate the one from the other without desti'oying both ; but where this connexion is less intimate, the outer surface is in general pretty smooth. The internal surface, when the Membrane has been carefully peeled off from the Substance of the Brain, and then floated in water, is always hairy or villous. After a minute injection, it is difficult to perceive any thing in it but Bloodvessels, which are interwoven with each other in every direction ; and according to their num- ber, and the closeness with which they are compacted to- gether, seem to produce all the varieties in the thickness and density of the Membrane. I never could discover any ap- pearance of Absorbents, or Nerves in it; nor so far as I know, have these been seen by others. At certain parts, there is occa- sionally an appearance of very fine, dense, white threads in it, particularly where it is least connected with the Arachnoid Membrane; but I am still uncertain,whether a very minute injection might not show these apparent fibres to be in re- ality Bloodvessels.

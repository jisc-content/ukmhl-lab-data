% 26 ANATOMY OF THE COMMON SYSTEMS, &C. consisting of the Brain and Spinal Cord. This Central Mass and the Nerves connected with it, form a third System, call- ed the Nervous System. These three Systems, the Circulating, Absorbent, and Ner- vous, as they are common to so many parts, I propose, for the sake of brevity, to call the Common Systems. Again, there are certain substances, or textures, which, although they be not so general in their distribution or con- nections as the Common Systems, enter, notwithstanding, into the composition of many different parts of the Body. These may be denominated the Common Textures ; and in this class I should be disposed to include, Cellular Substance, Adipose Substance, Muscle, Skin, Hair, Cartilage, Bone, Tendon, Se- rous Membrane, and Synovial Membrane*. There will be many advantages, in considering the Ana- tomy in general, of these Common Systems and Common Textures, before proceeding to treat of the structure of any individual part or organ in the Body. This, therefore, will form the subject of the two follow- ing Books. â€¢ Other Textures might, perhaps, have been admitted into this class. But I thought it better to include only those, of which the distribution was so ge- neral, as decidedly to entitle them to the appellation of Common. Bichat seems to me, to have arranged together, under the name of Mucous Membranes, Textures which differ most materially from each other. (See his Anat Gen. IV.)

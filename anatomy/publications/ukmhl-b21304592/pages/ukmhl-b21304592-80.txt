48 PARTS COMPOSING THE SIDES OF THE HEART. tcries, are seen running superficially between the Serous and the Muscular Coat. The Absorbent Vessels of the Heart are in general too small to be perceptible to the naked eye in their empty state. I have never seen them injected; but I rely with the ut- most confidence on the accuracy of the description and re- presentation of them which has been given by Mascagni*. Various small branches from both surfaces of the Heart, unite together into several trunks, which run along its anterior and posterior margins. The trunks on the an- terior margin uniting together, form a larger one, which ascends upwards towards the root of the Pulmonary Artery; while those on the posterior margin uniting in the same way, run up in the groove between the Left Auricle and Ventricle, towards the root of the Aorta. The two sets soon after join together, as will be more particularly described in another part of the work. Mascagni mentions that they are best brought into view in thin subjects, by injecting the Bloodvessels of the Heart with glue coloured with cinnaber. The glue passes into the Absorbents uncoloured, and makes them turgid. But they may, also, be injected about the Apex with Mercury; and if the Mercury be forced backwards towards the smal- ler branches on every side, the whole may be filled to the utmost degree of minuteness. All the branches now described lie between the Serous and the Muscular Coat. In very thin subjects, a plexus of slender AServes, may be 6een through the Serous Membrane, accompanying the two Coronary Arteries throughout the whole of their course; or they may be more distinctly brought into view by peeling off the Serous Coat. They are easily distinguish- ed from Bloodvessels or Absorbents by their whitish or Vasor. Lymph. Histor. p. 56.

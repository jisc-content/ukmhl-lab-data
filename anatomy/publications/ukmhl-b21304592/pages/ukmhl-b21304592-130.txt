m SUBSTANCE OF THE BIIAIN. stretched across between the two Upper Corpora Bigetni- na, and continued into these prominences on each side, and which, therefore, we shall call their Connecting Plate. Its base joins with the Posterior Commissure. Its colour is white; hut very often numerous small lines of a brighter white than the other parts, may be seen extending across it, throughout the whole of its extent. The Posterior surface of the Posterior Commissure is applied to it, but not connected with it; they form between them a sort of cul-de-sac, about a sixth of an inch deep, the mouth of which looks upwards and backwards, and which may be seen by turning the Pineal Gland forwards. Tine rest of the Median Line anterior to the Pineal Gland, is occupied by the opening of the Vertical Prolongation of the Middle Part. This opening, in the middle, is a mere slit, the sides of which are closely in contact; it enlarges how- ever, at each extremity, into a triangular orifice, one im- mediately before the Pineal Gland, about an eighth of an inch wide at its base, and another immediately behind the anterior extremity of the Fornix, a little wider. The Vertical Prolongation is not an uninterrupted fissure from above downwards; its sides are continued into each other in the middle, a little way from the opening above, for a space of about three eighths of an inch long, and a tenth of an inch thick. This connection is called the Com- missure of the Thalami Optici*. It varies in its dimensions a good deal; and it is said to be sometimes altogether awanting, though I confess, I have never found it so. In the natural situation of the Thalami, it has scarcely any breadth ; but when these bodies are pulled a little asunder, it takes the form of a thin plate, of a greyish colour, stretched across the fissure like abridge. The sides of the Vertical Prolongation around this Com- missure, are formed by the inner, flat, surfaces of the Tha- * Synonym. Ft. Commissure Mediane.

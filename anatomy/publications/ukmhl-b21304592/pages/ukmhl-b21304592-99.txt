THEIR STRENGTHâ€”COATS. 67 ed; for, I have often tried to split them into laminae, but in vain. The Outer Coat of Veins has the same structure as the Outer Coat of Arteries. It is thinner proportionally, how- ever, and its fibres are not so close. Its attachment to the Inner Coat is very firm; the fibres of the one appearing to be a good deal interwoven with those of the other. In almost all the trunks and larger branches of Veins, a substance is found intervening between these two Coats. Sometimes this substance surrounds the Vein entirely; but, in general, it occurs in patches of different sizes. It varies a good deal in its thickness; being as thick in some parts as the Outer Coat, and only half as thick in others. It seems to be of a nature between the External and Middle Coat of an Artery; the fibres being softer, darker coloured, and not so close, as those of the External Coat, and yet firmer, whiter, and less regularly disposed, than those of the Mid- dle One. When we hold a piece of Vein containing this par- tial Middle Coat between the eye and the light, it seems as if it were arranged into longitudinal fasciculi; but when we come to dissect it with the forceps, we do not find that its fibres separate more readily in the longitudinal direction than in any other. For about an inch before the entrance of the two Cavse into the Right Auricle, a stratum of scattered fibres, exactly resembling the Muscular fibres of the Auricles, may in ge- neral be seen in each of these Vessels, between the Outer and the Inner Coat. With respect to the Cellular Coat which is so generally ascribed to Veins, the same remark will apply to it, as to the Cellular Coat of Arteries ; viz. that there is, properly speaking, no such Coat; and that including it among the tu- nics of the Veins, only leads us to overlook the true Outet* Coat of these Vessels. 2

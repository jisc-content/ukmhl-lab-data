23 OF THE HEAIIT. SECTION I. OF THE HEAIIT. This is an organ consisting of two cavities, completely separated from each other by a Septum or partition. Each cavity is formed into two compartments, called Auricle and Ventricle, which communicate freely with each other. Se- veral Bloodvessels, denominated Veins, are connected with each Auricle, and one large one, called an Artery, arises from each Ventricle. When moderately distended, the Heart resembles, exter- nally, a three-sided pyramid. The base is turned backwards, to the right, and a little upwards; the apex, forwards, to the left, and a little down- wards. The surface which looks downwards is flat; the anterior and posterior surfaces, are slightly convex. The anterior margin is sharp; the posterior and upper, a good deal round- ed. The apex is obtuse, and, sometimes, a little forked. The flat surface is about five inches in length, and its greatest breadth, about four. The greatest height of the other two surfaces is about three inches and a half. The Auricles occupy, chiefly, the base of the Heart; a slight groove forming the line of separation, between them and the Ventricles, externally. They are placed, one be- hind the other; and the two Ventricles have the same rela- lative position. From this arrangement, the Cavities of the Heart might be divided into Anterior and Posterior. But owing to the oblique position of this organ, the Anterior Auricle and Ventricle, are placed more to the right, than the Posterior ; and, therefore, the four compartments are usually distinguished, by the terms Right and Left.

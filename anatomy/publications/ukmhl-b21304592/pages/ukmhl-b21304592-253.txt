221 CELLULAR SUBSTANCE IN GENERAL. substance and blowing in air, or by injecting into it, a fluid such as water. Either of these experiments shows very clearly, that all the cells communicate freely with each other; for, in this manner, the whole mass may be injected or inflat- ed from one point. In proportion as we continue to pull asunder a piece of Cellular Substance, the smaller laminae successively give way, and several cells are thus united into one; until at last the whole are torn. The instant the distention is dis- continued, the parts collapse, and the cellular appearance vanishes. Without mechanical distention of some sort, there is no appearance of cells in this Texture, either in the Living or the Dead Body. It is merely a substance, of which the parts are so constructed, as to assume this arrangement when they are gently separated from each other. Whether it consists, in its natural, undistended state, of numberless fine laminae, of a definite size and form, closely applied to each other ; or whether the cells are not formed by the mere ac- cidental separation of layers of the Substance, always ac- companied by greater or less laceration of parts, and of course varying with the direction and degree of the distending force, it is not easy to determine. The ease with which it may be separated into cells, and the extent to which the separation may be carried, without destroying the cellular appearance, is very different, in dif- ferent parts of the Body. Hence the distinction of this Texture into loose and dense. From the very extensive distribution of the Cellular Sub- stance, and the free communication of its cells when it is distended, air or thin fluids may be made to pass through it, from any one region of the Body almost to any other. This is exemplified even in the Living Body, in the diseases called Emphysema and Anasarca.

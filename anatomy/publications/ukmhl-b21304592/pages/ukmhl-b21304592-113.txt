ITS WEIGHT—UPPER SURFACE-HEMISPHERES. 81 The greater part of the surface of the Hemispheres is formed into serpentine ridges called Convolutions, lying close to each other, and running in various directions. These are of various shapes and sizes. Some are nearly three quarters of an inch broad at particular parts ; others scarce- ly a quarter of an inch. Some are of pretty uniform breadth throughout; others considerably broader at top than at the base. The Fossce between them also, vary very much in their depth, some being quite superficial, and others almost an inch deep. These Convolutions are seldom precisely alike, either in shape or size, in any two corresponding points of the oppo- site Hemispheres. In different Brains, I do not know that any two corresponding points, in either Hemisphere, have ever been observed exactly similar. The Brain Proper, viewed from above, is convex and of an oval shape, the small end of the oval being turned for- wards. In the middle along the Median line, is seen the Longi- tudinal Fissure; which towards the fore-part is not more than a twelfth of an inch broad, but widens out gradually behind, as it opens on the surface, until it is the breadth of a quarter or half an inch. The Hemispheres on each side of this are every where of a brownish colour*, and formed into Convolutions. These are rather smaller before than behind. If the Hemispheres be gently separated from each other along the Longitudinal Fissure, the surface of each Hemi- sphere looking towards the Fissure will be brought into view, straight and flat, and formed into Convolutions like those on the outside ; and at the bottom of the Fissure, part of the white, upper, surface of the Corpus Callosum will be seen * The colour is almost exactly that particular species it'brown which Mr. Syme, in his “ Nomenclature of Colourscalls Wood-Brown; aud which is ▼ery well exemplified in the Hazel-Nut.

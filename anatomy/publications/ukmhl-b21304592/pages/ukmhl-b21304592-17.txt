IX PREFACE. companicd the new term with the old; in order that, until the former, or some preferable appellation, be adopted, there may be no risk of ambiguity. As it is peculiarly desirable, however, in descriptive com- position, to avoid circumlocution, I have not hesitat- ed, in many instances, to apply names to parts which had no names before. The work is, throughout, purely Anatomical. I have scrupulously avoided the introduction of any Physiological matter; being convinced, that it tends rather to interrupt and distract, than to illustrate, the descriptive detail. The unconnected views of the Functions of the Body, which have been so com- monly interspersed in this manner with the descrip- tion of its Structure, are generally superficial and not often accurate. I reserve every thing that re- lates to the department of Physiology, for a sepa- rate Elementary Treatise. Being desirous of employing this Work as a Ma- nual for my public Lectures, I have endeavoured to consult the convenience of the Student, by dividing it into Volumes of small size. In this respect, I have followed the example of some of the most ju- dicious systematic writers on the Continent; and I trust, that the arrangement will not be objectionable to other classes of readers.

MEMBRANES OF TIIE SPINAL CORD. 1S6 Its outer surface is pretty smooth, except along the attach- ment of the Serrated Membrane; the Arachnoid Membrane being connected to it only here and there by long slender filaments. Its inner surface, when stripped from the Sub- stance of the Cord, and plunged into a fluid, is flocculent or villous. It is so much more difficult to inject it minutely, than the Pia Mater of the Brain, that there is much reason to believe, that its Vessels are interwoven with fine threads of a pecu- liar texture. The minute Bloodvessels, which enter so largely into its composition, have the same relation to the Substance of the Cord, that the Vessels of the Pia Mater of the Brain have to the Substance which it covers. The Pia Mater of the Top of the Cord is continuous on the forepart with the Pia Mater of the Annular Protube- rance ; laterally, with the Pia Mater of the Peduncles of the Cerebellum, the Subpeduncular and Spinal Lobules ; and behind, with that fringe of Plexus-looking substance for- merly described (p. 158.), as being attached to the Head of the Inferior Vermiform Process and its Wings. It does not line the surface of the Triangular Fossa, but passes directly across it, closely applied to the two Posterior Membraniform Piâ€™ocesses ; and this portion of it always exhibits, on the sur- face turned towards the Fossa, a small mass of the same Plexus-looking substance just alluded to*, and with which, indeed, it is connected above. In this manner, the Trian- gular Fossa is shut out from all communication with the ex- ternal surface of the Cord or Cerebellum ; and is made to form a part of a close cavity, along with the Central Fissure of the Cerebellum, into which it opens by the slit described p. 113, behind the lower surface of the Annular Protube- rance. This is the Cavity which has usually been deno- * This has been called the Choroid Plexus of the Fourth Ventricle.

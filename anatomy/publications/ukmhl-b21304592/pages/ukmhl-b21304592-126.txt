94. 'SUBSTANCE OF THE BRAIN. Posterieurcs. portion of the floor of the Oblong Passage. In its natural situation, only the posterior half of it can be seen ; the rest must be exposed by removing the posterior part of the Cor- pus Callosum, with all that portion of the Middle and Pos- terior Lobes, which are behind this. Sometimes a ridge of a whiter colour than the Upper Cor- pus Bigeminum itself, is seen extending outwards from the an- terior extremity of this Eminence, exactly in the place of the groove which is usually found between the Thalamus Op- ticus and the Inner Corpus Geniculatum. I have not found this ridge taken notice of by any author. At its origin it is about a twentieth of an inch in breadth, and it gradually tapers to a point, in the little hollow between the two Cor- pora Gcniculala. We may call it the Lateral Ridge of the Upper Corpus Bigeminum, The surface of the Lower Corpus Bigeminum* looks backwards and outwards. It is convex and oval shaped ; about three eighths of an inch long and two broad, with the long diameter placed almost horizontally. Its shape and dimensions, however, vary a little. A Lateral Ridge, about three eighths of an inch long and one broad, but vary* ing in its height in different subjects, is always found ek- tending from its upper margin close to its anterior extre- mity horizontally forwards. Both the prominence itself, and this Lateral Ridge, are quite smooth and of a white colour. Excepting the Lateral Ridge, the whole of the Lower Corpus Bigeminum is posterior to the Upper one. It is se- parated from this, and from its fellow on the opposite Hemisphere, by the Transverse and Longitudinal Furrows already described; there is a slight groove between the ex- â€¢ Synonyms.

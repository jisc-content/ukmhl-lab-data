BONE IN GENERAL. 254. 2. When a piece of Bone is immersed in Diluted Muria- tic Acid, an immediate, though inconsiderable, effervescence takes place. Minute Globules of a Gas, are seen rising from every point of the Bone. Hatchett ascertained that this Gas was Carbonic Acid *. If the Bone be kept a sufficient length of time in the Di- luted Acid, it is rendered soft and flexible, as I have al- ready remarked; the Acid, notwithstanding, remaining clear and colourless. a. If to this Acid in which the Bone has been steeped, a lit- tle Infusion of Galls be added, a pretty copious precipitate takes place. If to the same Acid, Pure Ammonia be added, a very copious precipitation is produced, of a pure white, floccu- lent, matter, which is Phosphat of Lime. The quantity of Phosphat, on an average, which may be obtained in this manner, will, I believe, be found to be about 50 per cent. of the whole Bone analysed. If, after all the Phosphat of Lime has been separated by the Pure Ammonia, a little Carbonat of Ammonia be dropt into the remaining liquor, a small quantity of Carbonat of Lime is thrown down. The proportion of this, on an aver- age, seems to me, to be about 10 per cent, of the whole Bone analysed. b. The soft, flexible, substance which remains, retaining the form of the Bone, after the ingredients just mentioned have been extracted by the Acid, was found by Hatchett -f*, to resemble Coagulated Albumen in most of its Chemical Pro- perties. It has usually been called Cartilage ; though it is perhaps better, to denominate it the Albuminous Part of Matter of any kind in pure Bone. When it seems to exist iu it, it has been derived, by transudation, either from Adipose Substance without, or from Marrow within. â€¢ Phil. Trans. 1799. p. 328. f Phil. Traus. 1799.

THEIR DISTRIBUTION. 03 the Veins appear to be continuations of the Arteries; if they have any other origin, it has not yet been satisfactorily â€¢de- monstrated. It is impossible, however, in any instance, to fix the precise point, at which the Artery ends and the Vein begins ; they pass insensibly into each other. Sometimes a sudden change in the direction of a capillary Artery enables us to judge that it has passed into a Vein ; but in general we cannot be cer- tain of this, until we see the Vessel uniting successively with other similar Vessels, and thus forming a larger tube. The appearance of the capillary Veins of a part is as va- rious as that of the Arteries. Throughout the Avhole Venous System, the same circum- stances may be observed, in the union of the branches one with another, as is observed, though in an inverse order, in the ramification of the Arteries Sometimes a small Venous branch runs into a larger one, without increasing its size in the slightest degree; at other times, two Veins of equal or unequal diameter, unite together, and form a trunk which is larger than either of them separately. Invariably, how- ever, in this latter case, the combined area of the branches is greater than the area of the trunk ; not according to any uniform ratio, but often in the proportion almost of two to one. Inosculation or Anastomosis between large branches, is much more common in the Venous than in the Arterial System. In this System, too, there is a mode of distribution, which Occurs much more frequently, than the reverse of it does in the other; and that is, the separation of a Venous Trunk into branches, in a direction towards the Heart. In general, this kind of ramification does not extend beyond a single divi- sion ; but there is a remarkable exception in the Portal Vein of the Liver, which is fairly resolved in this manner, within the substance of that organ, into capillary branches.

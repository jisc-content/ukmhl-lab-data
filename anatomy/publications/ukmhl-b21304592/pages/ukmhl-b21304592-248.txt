THE NERVES IN GENERAL. 21G The Origins of their Anterior Roots gradually approach the Median Fissure as they descend; those of the First being at the distance of a sixth of an inch, and those of the Twelfth only a tenth. The Origins of the Posterior Roots, on the other hand, are, from the First to the Twelfth, all at the distance of an eighth of an inch from the Median Fis- sure. The Anterior Roots of all the Dorsal Nerves, except the First, consist of one Fasciculus only, at the time they perforate the Arachnoid Membrane; the First consists of three or four. All the Posterior Roots, except the First and Second, are composed, in general, of two Fasciculi; the First consisting commonly of four, and the Second of three. The Anterior Roots, like those of the Cervical Nerves, consist at their immediate Origin of very delicate Fasciculi, which unite successively with each other, until they form one. The Fasciculi of the Posterior Roots arise directly from the Cord, of the same dimensions which they preserve throughout. Each of the Fasciculi of the Posterior Roots is nearly as large as the single Fasciculus composing the Anterior Roots. The Fasciculi of both Roots, increase a little in size, successively, from the First to the Twelfth Dorsal Nerve. As to the distance between each of the Anterior and Pos- terior Roots, the same remark will apply to these Nerves as to the Cervical; with this exception, that the distance between the Posterior Roots rather diminishes from the Eighth to the Twelfth Nerve. The inclination downwards of the first Dorsal Nerve, is a little greater than that of the Seventh Cervical, and the inclination increases regularly in all the remaining Dorsal Nerves in succession. The length of the Roots of the First, is about two thirds of an inch, that of the Twelfth about two inches.

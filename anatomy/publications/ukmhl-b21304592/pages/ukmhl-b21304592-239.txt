207 ORIGINS OF THE CEREBRAL NERVES. for about a quarter of an inch from their Origin, are less closely bound together than farther forwards, where they are compacted into a close cord. Origins of the Internal Ocuh-Mitscular Nerves. The Internal Oculo-muscular Nerve arises, on each side, in general, from a point already described, p. 111, on the up- per and inner part of the Pillar of the Vieussenian Valve. Sometimes, however, it takes its Origin a little farther in- wards ; at other times nearer the Lower Corpus Bigeminum; and at other times farther downwards. From its Origin it passes outwards and forwards, round the Pillar of the Vieussenian Valve ; then forwards round the outer surface of the Peduncle of the Brain Proper, lying immediately above the Superior Cerebellar Artery ; and then about half way between the Annular Protuberance and the Inner Lobule of the Middle Lobe, it perforates the Arachnoid Membrane. The length of this course is about an inch and a half; and the Nerve, throughout, is round, and scarcely more than a fortieth of an inch thick. The Pia Mater peels off from it so easily, that I rather imagine it is not composed of Filaments or Fasciculi. After coagulation, however, I find, that it splits up, from end to end, very readily. Sometimes, just at its Origin, it consists of two or three smaller threads. Origins of the External Oculo-Muscular Nerves. The External Oculo-Muscular Nerve arises, on each side, from the lower margin of the Annular Protuberance of the Cerebellum, at the point described p. 113 *. • I have seen examples of most of those appearances which have been de- scribed by Vico. d’ Azyk (Traits d’Auatomie, p. 52.) as varieties in the Origin

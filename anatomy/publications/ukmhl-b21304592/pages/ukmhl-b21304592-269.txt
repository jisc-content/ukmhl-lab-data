237 SKIN IN GENERAL. tion in the Cuticle, corresponding exactly to the mouth of the canal in the True Skin. I believe that this is its ar- rangement also, with respect to the Sebaceous Follicles. When the Cuticle is examined in the closest manner, either with the naked eye or with the microscope, not the slightest appearance can be discovered in it, either of lami- ns or fibres; nor has maceration, nor any other pi-ocess with which I am acquainted, the least effect in unfolding any structure of this sort in it. In almost all persons in health, there are certain parts of the Soles of the Feet, on which the Epidermis is divisible into layers; but this seems to be purely the effect of compression, which accumulates into a thick stratum, those portions of the Cuticle which are constantly separated from its surface, and which in other parts of the Body, are immediately removed. This lami- nated appearance of the Epidermis, is never seen, in the Soles of persons who have been long confined to bed, or in those, who, from accident or disease, have not been able to put the foot to the ground. Tn the Palms of the Hands, too, the Scarf-Skin may sometimes be peeled off in layers; but only in persons, in whom this part of the Body has been ex- posed to constant and considerable pressure. One would have expected to have found the Cuticle full of Pores ; and yet it is curious, that, even with the most powerful microscopes, not a single pore can be seen in it. Cruikshank’s observations on this subject accord so com- pletely with my own, that I cannot do better than trans- cribe them. “ When a piece of Cuticle,” says he, “ falls off from the “ Cutis*, some of the Hairs go with it, and some remain “ with the Cutis. Those Plairs certainly perforated the “ Cuticle, yet in the microscope not the least vestige of these “ perforations can be traced. In places where the Hairs • By Cutis, he means True Skin.

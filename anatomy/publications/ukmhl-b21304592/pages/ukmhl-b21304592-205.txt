ACCORDING TO AGE, 173 being usually from 18000 to 20000 grains; and that these two parts preserve the same weight for the remainder of Life; 3. That the younger the Foetus, the greater the ratio of the weight of the Brain Proper to that of the Cerebellum ; that the nearer the Foetus approaches the Period of Birth, the more slowly is the ratio of the weight of the Brain Proper to the Cerebellum diminished ; that this ratio, at the age of three years, is usually about 7 to 1; and that it remains the same ever after *. Soemmerring -fy Bichat J, and the Wenzels §, agree in stating, that the Nervous Matter of the Brain, in an Em- bryo of five or six months, is almost fluid; and that it gra- dually increases in consistence, with the age of the subject; so that it is always firmest in those who are most advanced in years. The Wenzels have subjected the Nervous Matter of the Brain at Birth, to examination with the microscope, and have found it to be composed of Globules, differing from those in the Adult, only in size||. According to Bichat IT, the Nervous Matter of the Brain, in the Foetus, is dissolved with great facility by the Caustic Alkali. The first effect of this substance upon it, is to change it into a viscid, transparent, reddish matter, capable of being drawn out into threads like White of Egg; it then dissolves it entirely. Acids coagulate the Nervous Matter, he also found, as in the Adult, but they do not render it so hard. In the Brain of an Embryo of three months, the Wen- zels** found the whole Substance of a pearly colour, with- out any appearance of Brown Nervous Matter. The Brown • De Penitior, &c. p. 265. 296.

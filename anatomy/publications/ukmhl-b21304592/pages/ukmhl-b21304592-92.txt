Between the two Coats there seems to be no connecting medium ; but yet they adhere very firmly. The Middle Coat, however, is so much softer than the Outer, particularly in Vessels of a middling size, that if we slit up an Artery, and strip it through between the finger and thumb, we may scrape off the whole of the Middle Coat from the External, merely by pressing a little with the edge of the nail. Numerous small Bloodvessels may be seen, every where, ramifying through the External Coat of Arteries, and send- ing branches inwards to supply the Middle Coat. Small branches of Absorbents, also, and minute twigs of Nerves, may sometimes be observed running along its outer surface; but it is difficult to trace them far into its substance. The thickness of this Coat, varies much more than that of the other two. In some vessels, as in the Vertebral Arte- ries and the branches of the Internal Carotid, it is as thin al- most as silk-paper. It is greatly stronger than either the Middle or Inner Coat, and considerably more elastic. To call this, however, or any of the other Coats in particular, the Elastic Coat of an Artery, as has been done by some*, is obviously in- correct. They all possess this property in a considerable degree; else stretching an Artery, should always tear them asunder. Mu. HuNTEu’s-j- description of the structure of Arte- ries is rather vague. Bichat| describes the Inner Coat under the name of Membrane Commune du Systeme a Sang Rouge ; the Middle one, he calls Membrane Propre des Arteres ; and the External, Tissu Cellulaire.

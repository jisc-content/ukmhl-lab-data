IN THE FOETUS. 18 Very few enjoy opportunities of ascertaining, the gra- dual changes which take place in the External Form of the Fcetus, during the earlier periods of its developement. Anatomists are, therefore, the more indebted to Soemmer- ring, for the excellent series of Engravings, in which he has represented these changes, from the first to the fifth month after Impregnation *. In this series, an Embryo only three or four -weeks old, looks, to the naked eye, like a mustard-seed, which has just begun to grow; the Head being like the body of the seed, and the Trunk and remaining parts like the radicle. But with a magnifying glass, a little dark circle can be dis- tinctly seen in the region of theEyes, and a small slit cor- responding to the orifice of the Mouth. Four little promi- nences are observable on the Trunk, in the situation of the four Extremities; and between the two lower, there is a curious prolongation like a tail, which has been called the Coccygeal Protuberance. In an Embryo of about seven weeks, the proportional size of the Head is so much less, that the peculiar form of the Human Body is quite apparent. Two small pores are per- ceptible in the Region of the Nose ; and the upper Extre- mities seem divided into Arm and Forearm. In an Embryo of about eight weeks, a small pore may be discovered, by the microscope, in the Region of each Auricle; a Shoulder, Arm, Forearm, and Hand, with five small tubercles in the situation of the Fingers, can be easily distinguished with the naked eye; and in the lower Extre- mities, parts can be seen corresponding to the Thigh, Leg, and Foot; but there is no appearance of Toes. leones Einbryonum Humanorum.

BONE IN GENERAL. 251 Its Chemical Properties do not yet seem to have been particularly investigated. In its purest form, however, I believe, that it is entirely soluble in Boiling Water. Thin dried slices of it, I find, are acted upon by the Acids some- what in the same manner that Cuticle is*. Cartilage has the same structure in the Female as in the Male. In the Foetus and young subject, Cartilage has much less of the opal appearance, which we observe in it in the Adult. It is, also, more transparent, softer, and less elas- tic. In the Decline of Life, it becomes whiter, more opaque, harder, and less elastic; and in many parts of the Body, is to a greater or less extent, converted into Bone. This last change occurs very early after Middle Age, in some indi- viduals ; but, in general, the tendency does not manifest it- self, until the later Periods of Life. CHAPTER VII. THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF BONE. Bone, or Osseous Substance, in the Human Bod}', resem- bles, in its recent state, the corresponding Texture in the Bodies of Quadrupeds. * In Mr. Hatchettâ€™s admirable Papers on Shell and Bone, and on Mem- branous Parts, (Phil. Trans. 1799, 1800.) there are several remarks on the composition of Cartilage. But the author does not state whether he analysed any of the Cartilage of the Human Body, or whether he does not in general mean by this term, the soft part of Bone, which is left after steeping it in di- luted Acids. He found it to resemble Coagulated Albumen in most of its Chemical Properties. It cannot be sufficiently regretted, that this able philosopher has withdrawn himself so much, of late years, from those departments of experimental science, in which his talents seem so eminently calculated to lead to interest- ing discoveries.

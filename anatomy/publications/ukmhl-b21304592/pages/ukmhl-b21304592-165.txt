NERVOUS MATTER OF PARTICULAR PARTS. 133 dually disappearing without reaching its surface. The pos- terior third of this vault, is composed entirely of White Ner- vous Matter; hut from the upper surface of this portion of it also, short and slender filaments are found extending, into the Brown Matter forming the posterior extremity of the Corpus Striatum. Immediately within the Peduncles of the Brain Proper, there is, on each side, a stratum about an eighth of an inch thick, of a very singular looking substance. In some spots it is almost as dark coloured as soot, in others, of a white and dark-brown hue. Its consistence too I think is firmer than the common Nervous Matter. It stretches across, with a slight concavity inwards, from the Anterior to the Poste- rior margin of each Peduncle ; and corresponds exactly to the Peduncles in height*. In contact with this dark coloured substance on the fore- part, and nearer to the Median Line, there is, on each side, an oval nodule of Nervous Matter, in colour somewhat be- tween Wood-Brown and Yellowish-White, surrounded by a coating of Orange-White Matter. The substance immediately between and below these no- dules is chiefly Orange-White Matter; but towards the Median Plane, there is a slight intermixture of Greyish- Brown ; and if the substance be divided symmetrically, by an incision parallel to the Median Plane, the White Ner- vous Matter will appear on the surface of the section, in the form of fine lines running directly backwards. The whole of that portion of the Brain Proper, which lies immediately behind the parts now described, may be regard- ed as belonging to the Corpora Bigemina. Both these pro- minences, together with their Lateral Ridges, are formed ex- ternally of a thin layer of Yellowish-White Matter, which * Sysommys. Vicq dâ€™Azyr describes this substance under the name of Tacbe Noire, or Locus Niger Crurum Cerebri. 3

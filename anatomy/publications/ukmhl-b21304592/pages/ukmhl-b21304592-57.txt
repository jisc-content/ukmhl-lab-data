PART II. THE ANATOMY OF THE COMMON SYSTEMS AND COMMON TEXTURES. In almost all parts of the Body, certain tubes called Blood- vessels are found, which convey the Blood to these parts from the Heart, and return it from them to the Heart again. The Heart and the Bloodvessels together, therefore, form one System; which, from the important function of the Living Body, to which it is subservient, viz. the Circula- tion of the Blood, is denominated the Circulating System. In almost all parts of the Body, too, certain tubes are found, which are constantly employed in absorbing sub- stances from these parts, and are therefore called Absorbent Vessels, or Absorbents. These uniting one with another, at last form two Trunks, which open into Bloodvessels ; and the whole constitute another System, denominated the Ab- sorbent System.

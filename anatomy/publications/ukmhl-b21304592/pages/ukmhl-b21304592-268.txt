SKIN IN CENEItAL, 23 G The True Skin is invariably united to the parts which if, covers, by means of Cellular Substance, which is intimately interwoven with its inner surface. When a blister happens to be formed, by any accident, on the surface of the Body, the pellicle which is raised by the fluid of the blister, and which, when divided, allows this fluid to escape, is that part of the Skin, which is called the Cuticle. Every person, therefore, I presume, has a pretty good general idea of this substance. To enable one to examine it minutely, it must be separ- ated from the True Skin, in the manner already described. It is seldom more than a fifth or a sixth part the thick- ness of the portion of True Skin which it covers. It is inferior in elasticity to the True Skin, very .flexible, and easily torn. It is transparent, and of a slightly yellowish-grey colour. The colour of the outer surface of the True Skin is, there- fore, seen through it; and upon the colour of this surface, blended with the slight tinge of grey from the Cuticle, I have no doubt whatever, that the natural colour of the Skin, in all Europeans, depends. Its inner surface presents an appearance precisely the re- verse of its outer, and of the outer surface of the True Skin to which it is applied ; every Furrow or Depression in these, has a ridge or Eminence corresponding to it in the other, and vice versa. In general, however, as was formerly remarked, when the Cuticle is peeled off from the True Skin, the Hairs are extracted along with it; consequently, the por- tions of the Hairs which were lodged in the canals of the True Skin, are now seen projecting from the inner surface of the Epidermis. I once thought, that each of these canals in the True Skin, was lined with a little sheath of Cuticle, which came away with the portion of the Hair contained in the canal; but on more attentive examination, I suspect, that this is not the case ; but that there is simply a perfora- I

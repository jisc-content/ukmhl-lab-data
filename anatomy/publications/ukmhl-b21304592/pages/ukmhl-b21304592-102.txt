70 ABSORBENT VESSELS IN GENERAL. * Anatomy of the Absorbing Vessels, p. 56. In shape, an Absorbent Vessel may be compared to a por- tion of a Vein containing a great many pairs of Valves; it has a notched or jointed appearance. The notches are so frequent, that it often resembles a number of little vesicles joined together, or a string of beads. The smaller Absorbent Vessels are pretty uniform in their diameter; but the larger branches are subject to much greater variety, in point of size, than even the Veins. No- thing is more common, than to see them swelling out, sud- denly, into a sinus three or four times their diameter at other parts. Sometimes we find the Absorbent Vessels of particular parts, so filled with a reddish or whitish fluid after Death, that we can not only see all the larger branches easily with the naked eye, but, with the microscope, can trace some of the smallest to their very beginnings. Without some na- tural or artificial injection of this sort, however, these Ves- sels are so thin and colourless, that even their larger branch- es are imperceptible with the most powerful glasses. The fluid best adapted for injecting into the Absorbents with this view, is Quicksilver. With proper management, this substance may be made to fill the smaller Absorbent Vessels, to a degree of minuteness altogether inconceivable to those who have not seen it. Of course, however, it is only in transparent parts, or on the surfaces of opaque or- gans, that the minute ramifications of the System, are ca- pable of being demonstrated. In no organ in the Body, is it possible to trace the Absor- bents, to their beginnings, with the naked eye; and there is only one part, in which their origins have been seen, even with the miscroscope, viz. the surface of the Small Intestine. Cruikshank* was fortunate enough, in one case, to find the Absorbents belonging to this part of the Alimentary Ca-

NERVOUS MATTER OF PARTICULAR PARTS. 141 covers the whole anterior surface of the Protuberance. Secondly, there is a stratum scarcely more than a fiftieth of an inch thick, which extends on the Median Plane from before backwards, and also from the top of the Protuber- ance to the bottom with a few interruptions, so that it di- vides the Protuberance symmetrically*. Thirdly, there are various laminae which run across from one side of the Protuberance to the other, intersecting the stratum last de- cribed, and having a slight convexity forwards. Some of these seem to extend from top to bottom of the Protuber- ance ; others are narrower and of various breadths. They vary also in their thickness, some being as fine as a hair, others nearly an eighth of an inch thick ; and often the same stratum is thicker at one part than at another. There are usually from ten to twelve of these, and one of them occu- pies exactly the place of the imaginary section, by which the Protuberance was bounded behind. Fourthly, various les- ser strata are seen running obliquely between these lami- nae. The other kind of Matter, that which appears of an Orange-White colour when divided vertically, is arranged in plates or fibres which are much more difficult to trace than those of the former. They all seem to arise, from a small mass or nucleus of the same kind of matter, occupy- ing the lowest part of the Protuberance on each side of the Median Line. From this they extend upwards and a little outwards; some towards the anterior part bending forwards in their course, like the strata of the former kind of matter; others towards the middle running almost di- rectly upwards; and others again, behind, forming a curve convex backwards. They do not remain single throughout, however, but often split or subdivide into lesser plates or fibres, giving an appearance of ramification, in vertical slices Vica d’Azyr calls this, “ Raphe de la Protuberance Annulaire.”

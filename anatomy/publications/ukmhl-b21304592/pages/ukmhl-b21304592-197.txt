PIA MATER ITS GRANULATIONS. 165 Mater, depending upon one or other of these causes, is every day erroneously set down, as an effect and indication of a previously inflamed state of that Membrane, or a morbid determination of Blood to the Vessels of the Brain in gene- ral. But the appearance of vascularity produced by in- flammation is very different from this; and topical conges- tions such as are here supposed, are no longer perceptible after the circulation has ceased. Along the whole of the upper and inner margiq of each Hemisphere of the Brain Proper, there are usually found enveloped in the Pia Mater, clusters or patches of little soft bodies called Granulations*. These are of a whitish or yel- lowish colour, about the size of the head of a pin, and sel- dom single, but joined together into groups, apparently, by the net-work of the Pia Mater. I have not been able to discover any thing relative to their intimate structure. They do not seem to be very vascular. They are disposed chiefly, around the extremities of the Veins, which have just been described, entering into the Longitudinal Sinus of the Dura Mater ; and are easily distinguished, through the Arachnoid Membrane, by their peculiar colour, when the Dura Mater is raised from the upper surface of the Brain. I have never seen them in any other region of the Brain Proper or Cere- bellum. The substances which Bichat -j- has ranked along with them, in the Choroid Membrane and Choroid Plexus, and in the Pia Mater of the Spinal Fossa of the Cerebellum, seem to me to be of a different nature; they look like ten- der convolutions of Bloodvessels, and, therefore, I have spo- ken of them as Plexuses. The Arachnoid Membrane differs very much from the Pia Mater both in structure and distribution. Placed on the outside of this coat, it embraces only the more superficial parts of the external surface of the Brain. It neither dips "Synonym. Glands of Pacchioni. Anatom. Descrip. III. p. 63* 3

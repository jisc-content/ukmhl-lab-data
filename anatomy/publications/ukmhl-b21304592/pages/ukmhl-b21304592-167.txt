NERVOUS MATTER OF PARTICULAR PARTS. 135 De Corp. Hum. Fab. IV. p. 63. times agttin, they are irregularly scattered through its sub- stance. There is the greatest variety in their number. In two or three instances, after the strictest search, I have not been able to find more than a single particle within the whole Gland. The Specific Gravity of this sandy-look- ing matter seems considerable; it sinks to the bottom in water very quickly. Its chemical properties have not yet been satisfactorily ascertained; but I am inclined to think, from the following experiments, that it resembles Osseous Substance very closely. 1. I placed two particles of it, of the largest size, on a red-hot iron plate ; and they both became brown immedi- diately, and then gradually black, emitting the smell of burnt horn. When exposed to a stronger heat they burnt, and left a pure white brittle residuum. 2. I placed a large particle in the middle of a drop of pure Muriatic Acid, on a plate of glass. An immediate and pretty copious effervescence took place; and in the course of an hour, the whole particle had become soft, opaque, and slightly elastic, at the same time enlarging a little, and ac- quiring a paler hue. This soft residuum, when placed on a red-hot plate of iron, burnt completely away, emitting a smell of horn; and when a drop of pure Ammonia was added to the drop of Muriatic Acid in which the particle had been softened, a thick white cloud was immediately produced, exactly similar to that which is caused, by the same means, in Muriatic Acid in which a piece of Bone has been steeped. In these experiments, it is presumed that the soft resi- duum was similar to the Albuminous Part of Bone ; that the effervescence was caused by Carbonic Acid ; and that the white flaky precipitate, consisted of Phosphate of Lime. I have seen one instance, in which the Pineal Gland con- tained a sinus, such as Soemmerring * has described, open-

MEMBRANES OE THE BRAIN. 150 tion, immediately above the angular recess formed on each side by the Posterior Tubercle of the Thalamus and the Pineal Gland, a small fringe of the same kind of texture as the Choroid Plexus. Vicq, d’Azyr first observed this sub- stance, and he has called it the Plexus of the Pineal Gland*. The Choroid Plexus differs very much in appearance and structure from the Choroid Membrane. When the Cen- tral Fissure is laid open in a recent Brain, it is usually dis- tinguished by its pink or bright red colour. When floated in water, it has aflocculent or downy appearance; and some- times little cysts or vesicles are seen in it; though these are rather to be regarded as morbid appearances. Injections seem to show that it is chiefly composed of minute Arteries much convoluted ; but Venous branches are very apparent in it also. It has no attachments but to the margin of the Choroid Membrane, to which it is joined merely by fine Bloodvessels. Beginning at the very apex of this Mem- brane, immediately under the Anterior Tubercles of the Thalami Optici, it runs backwards on each side external to the margin of the Fornix, and then forwards along the outer border of the Taenia Hippocampi, to the extremity of the Anterior Lateral Part of the Central Fissure. At its commencement above and before, it is seldom much broad- er than an eighth of an inch, but it enlarges as it proceeds backwards, so as to fill the whole of the hollow between the edge of the Fornix and the Corpus Striatum; and when it descends into the Anterior Lateral Part, it is of sufficient size to cover the whole upper surface of the Hippocampus. The attachments of . the Choroid Membrane to the Sub- stance of the Brain Proper, are so close, that the Central Fissure, before the removal of this Membrane, is a shut ca- vity, from which a fluid as thin even as water cannot es- cape to the surface of the Brain; and it is by means of the " Traite d’Anatomie, p. 21.

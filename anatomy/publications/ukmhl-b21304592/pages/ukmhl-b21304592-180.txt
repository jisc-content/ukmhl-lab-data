148 SUBSTANCE OF THE BRAIN. the same Process. Very often those two last appear as Secondary Strata, arising from a common Primary one scarcely more than a twelfth of an inch long. About half an inch farther back, is a Stratum about a quarter of an inch in length, which divides only into Ternary Strata; and im- mediately behind this, is the last Primary Stratum arising from this surface, about half an inch in length, inclining downwards and backwards, and dividing into Secondary and Ternary Strata. From this surface, also, two or three Ternary Strata are seen arising, generally about its middle. From the posterior margin of the Middle Part of the Cen- tral Mass, only one Stratum arises, and in this section it is divided exactly in the middle. It is sometimes a Primary Stratum, about a third of an inch long, projecting directly backwards in the same plane with the Middle Part itself, and sending off two or three very small Ternary Strata; at other times it is merely a Ternary Stratum about a sixth of an inch in length. Secondly, by a section begun on the superior surface of each Hemisphere, along a line running from the middle of its anterior to the middle of its posterior margin, and con- tinued perpendicularly downwards through the Hemisphere, so as to divide it into two parts nearly equal. From the superior surface of the Lateral Part of the Cen- tral Mass in this section, eight or nine Primary Strata are usually seen arising. Four, sometimes five, are in general found succeeding each other from before backwards, vary- ing in height from an eighth to a third of an inch, the first inclining forwards a little, the third and fourth a little back- wards, and the second stretching directly upwards; and di- viding, some into Ternary Strata alone, others both into Se- condary and Ternary. To these succeeds, immediately, a Stratum about an eighth of an inch in length and thickness, which divides into two Secondary Strata, each more than a

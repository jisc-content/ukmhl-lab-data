BONE IN GENERAL. 255 Bone. Its quantity on an average, is from 35 to 40 per cent, of the whole Bone analysed. 3. When a piece of Calcined Bone is plunged into Di- luted Muriatic Acid, Carbonic Acid is disengaged, and it is entirely dissolved; and if to the solution Pure Ammonia, and afterwards Carbonat of Ammonia, as in the last ex- periment, be added, Phosphat and Carbonat of Lime are precipitated, and in the same proportions *. It is the Albuminous Part alone of Osseous Substance, therefore, which seems to be destroyed by Calcination; and upon this Part, it would appear, from the brittleness of Calcined- Bone, the elasticity of the Texture entirely depends. On the other hand, it is the Calcareous Matter alone or chiefly, which is removed by the Diluted Acids; and to this, as the flexibility of the steeped Bone clearly shews, the firmness of Osseous Substance is owing. 4. By a very delicate and difficult analysis, Fourcroy and Vauquelin say, that they obtained from Human Bone, Phosphats of Magnesia, Iron, Manganese, Silex, and Alu- mina. They do not mention the quantities of these ingre- dients yielded; but there is no doubt, that they were ex- ceedingly minute. The account of the processes they em- ployed is tedious; and, therefore, I shall content myself with merely referring to the Memoir in which they are de- scribed*!-. 5. Berzelius informs us, that by a minute analysis of recent, dry, Human Bone, the particulars of which, how- ever, he has not detailed, he obtained from it 2 per cent. of Fluat of Lime *. * I have repeatedly endeavoured to discover Sulphat of Lime in the Acid Solution both of Calcined, and Uncalcined, Bone ; but always without suc- cess. f Journal de Physique.

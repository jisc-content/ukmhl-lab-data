210 THE NERVES IN GENERAL. Origins of the Auditory Nerves. The Auditory Nerve arises, on each side, from the ante- rior surface of the Peduncle of the Cerebellum, immediate- ly behind the Origin of the Facial Nerve. (See p. 117.) From its Origin, it extends outwards, forwards, and a little upwards, for about a third of an inch, in the same di- rection as the Facial Nerve. It is closely applied to the posterior surface of this Nerve, and perforates the Arachnoid Membrane along with it. Below and behind it rests on the Sub-peduncular Lobule; and at the lower and forepart, it is partially covered, by the Plexus-looking substance attach- ed to that Lobule. This portion of the Auditory Nerve is always of a flat- tened shape, one surface looking inwards and the other out- wards ; and its greatest diameter is about an eighth of an inch. It does not acquire the Filamentous structure of Nerve in general, until it is just about to perforate the Ar- achnoid Membrane. Before this, it consists of a cord of undivided, White, Nervous Matter; sometimes of two or three such cords, bound together by Pia Mater. This portion, I find, is distinctly fibrous in the longitudinal direction, after coagulation. Origins of the Spinal Nerves. Origins of the Glosso-Pharyngeal Nerves. The Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve arises, on each side, from the anterior margin of the Peduncle of the Spinal Cora, close to the Annular Protuberance of the Cerebellum. It extends, forwards, at first, and a very little outwards, closely applied to the Plexus-looking substance which covers

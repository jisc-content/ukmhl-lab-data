HAIR IN GENERAL. â€¢ See Bichat, Anat. Gener. IV. p. 812. f Phil, Trang. 1815. t45 been first remarked by Fourcroy* ; viz. that when a Hair is placed, lengthways, between the points of the Finger and Thumb, and the Finger and Thumb are then moved back- wards and fowards on each other, the Hair is gradually for- ced from between them, and invariably in the direction of its Root. This motion had been supposed to be owing to minute serrae on the sides of the Hair, all inclining towards its Point; although no such projections could be perceived, by the most powerful microscopes. The larger Hairs are often split into two, towards the point; this, however, as well as the general tapering along the whole of the Middle Part, I believe to'be entirely owing to attrition. Whatever the colour of the Hair may be, the Root is al- ways whitish, and semitransparent; particularly that part of it which is lodged in the Bulb. It is always much softer, too, at this part, than at any other ; the very lowest portion, being almost fluid. After many observations with the microscope, I should be inclined to pronounce the Hair to be a solid cylinder throughout; without cells or canals of any kind. There is in the whiskers of the Seal, a small conical cavity in that part of the Root of the Hair, which is contained in the Bulb ; but whether there be a similar arrangement in Human Hair, I do not know. Nor have Hairs ever appeared to me, to be composed of fi- bres or laminae placed closely together, as one would be led to imagine, from the representations which have sometimes been given of them. Dr. Brewster very justly com- pares them to threads of spun glass; and it is one of the many curious facts, recently ascertained by this most inge- nious and successful inquirer, that Hairs depolarize Light, and possess the most perfect neutral axes; the axes being parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the Hair-J*.

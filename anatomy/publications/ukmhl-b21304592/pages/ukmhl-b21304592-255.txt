223 ADIPOSE SUBSTANCE IN GENERAL. CHAPTER II. THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OE ADIPOSE SUBSTANCE. Every one may be presumed to be familiar with the ap- pearance of the Substance called Fat, in the bodies of Quad- rupeds. The Adipose Substance or Fat of the Human Body, is pretty much the same. Next, perhaps, to the Cellular Substance, this Texture is the most extensively distributed throughout the Body ; but it varies very much in its quantity, in different individuals, It seems, almost every where, to be accompanied with Cel- lular Substance; whether, indeed, it ever occurs without this Texture, is very doubtful. Its colour and consistence vary a little, in different regions of the Body. In some, it is of a pretty deep yellow colour, in others, straw-coloured ; in some parts it is pretty firm and elastic, in others, rather soft and easily torn. In mak- ing this comparison, however, it is necessary, that the dif- ferent specimens submitted to examination, should be at the same temperature; for example, betwixt 95° and 100° Fah1., which is nearly the standard temperature of the Living Body. It is obviously composed of two distinct substances; an Oily Matter, and a Vascular Cellular Texture, in which this Matter is contained. The Oily Matter possesses all the characters physical and chemical, of the class of Oils called Fixed. Its more pe- culiar or specific properties, do not seem to have been inves- tigated. It is deeper in its colour in some parts than in others ; and the colour of the whole Texture obviously de- pends upon it. It seems to me most probable, that it exists every where in the Living Body in a perfectly fluid state.

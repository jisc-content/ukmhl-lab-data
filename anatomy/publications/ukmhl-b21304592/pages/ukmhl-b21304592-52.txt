‘ ,7 m ,* BOOK III. OF THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY. At the period of Maturity, but still more remarkably to- wards Middle-Age, there seems to be the greatest variety in the Weight of different persons, even of the same Sta- ture. From an examination, however* of a Register of the Weights of about fifty Full-Grown Males, of the ave- rage Stature, I am inclined to tlhnk, that the mean Weight of the Adult Male is about 140 lbs. English Troy. I have had no opportunity of forming a satisfactory es- timate of the average weight of the Adult Female; but I should suppose it to be about 30 or 40 lbs. less than that of the Male. An Embryo of six weeks, which was examined by Wris- eerg*, weighed only 37 grains: and one of ten weeksf, weighed about 3 drams. According to Mr. Burns}, an Embryo in the twelfth week, weighs, in general, about 2 oz ; at the sixth month, about 1 lb ; and at the eighth from 4 to 5 lbs Troy. • De Vita Foetuum, &c. -j- Descrip.

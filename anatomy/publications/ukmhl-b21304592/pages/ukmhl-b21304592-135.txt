CENTRAL FISSURE OF THE BRAIN PROPER. 103 The whole surface of the Fornix is of a white colour. In general, a slight furrow may be seen, extending from the junction of the Anterior Pillars, for about half way backwards along the Median Line, and then vanishing. Extremely delicate grooves, too, are commonly perceptible, running along the lateral borders ; and sometimes, towards the base, there is an appearance of similar stria and ridges inclining from the sides towards the Median Line, and more or less forwards. It is to this last appearance, when it occurs, that the name of the Lyre* has been given. On each side of the Median Line, on the roof of the Middle Part of the Central Fissure, there is a concave sur- face, almost precisely the reverse of the convex surfaces of the Corpus Striatum and Thalamus Opticus, below. The portion of this concave surface anterior to the apex of the Fornix, and corresponding to the most prominent part in- ternally of the Corpus Striatum, is formed by the surface of a narrow partition called Septum Lucidum. This Septum is interposed on the Median Line, between the Anterior Pro- longations of the Middle Part of the Central Fissure; and is continuous behind, with the Anterior Pillars and Apex of the Fornix. At its base, it is fully a quarter of an inch thick, but towards its Middle and Upper part, scarcely more than an eighth. The surface of the Septum, and also a small part of the surface above and before it, is of a grey colour, though not so dark as the Corpus Striatum. The rest of the concave upper surface of the Middle Part, is white and glossy. Of these surfaces forming the roof pf the Middle Part, the portion called the Fornix rests on the Thalami Optici, with the intervention, only, of a thin vascular membrane, afterwards to be described. It is not large enough however, to cover them altogether. If we suppose the upper surface of these prominences to be divided into two, by a line drawn * Synonym. Lat. Psalteriuin.

SUBSTANCE OK THE BRAIN. •)• See Syme’s Nomenclature of Colours. 12G per cent, only of this substance, is obtained, from the Ner- vous Matter analyzed. 4. According to Fourcroy, when Nervous Matter from the Brain, is triturated with diluted sulphuric or nitric acid, part is dissolved, and part separated in the form of a coagu- lum ; the acid liquor remaining transparent and colourless. 5. Fourcroy observes, that when pure concentrated pot- ash is added to Nervous Matter from the Brain, complete solution takes place, accompanied with the disengagement of a great quantity of ammonia. Biciiat#, however, af- firms, that a considerable proportion of White Nervous Matter always remains undissolved in the alcalis. Brown Nervous Matter, like the former species, varies a little in its hue in different parts of the Brain. Its preva- lent colour is Wood-Brown ; but, sometimes, it resembles a mixture of Wood-Brown and Lead-grey. This latter, we shall call Greyish-Brown. The Brown Nervous Matter is always softer than the White. When divided with a sharp scalpel, the surfaces of the section are quite uniform, presenting no appearance either of fibres or laminaz. Little points and streaks of a bright red colour, are seen on them, just as in the dissection of a portion of White Matter; but these are obviously owing to the division of Bloodvessels. By examination with powerful Microscopes, Prochaska and the Wenzels have discovered a similar appearance of roundish particles or globules, in this kind of Nervous Mat- ter, as in the other; and there is reason to believe from their observations, that the globules are nearly, if not ex- actly the same, in the two kinds of Matter, both in point of -shape and magnitude. * Anatom.

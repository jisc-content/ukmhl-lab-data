Before entering on the proper subject of the present Work, one or two observations, relative to Nomenclature, require to be premised. By the Period of Impregnation, or Conception, is uniformly meant, the moment at which a Child or Infant Being, be- gins to be formed within the Womb of the Mother. While the Child is yet retained within the Womb, it is denominated a Foetus or Embryo ; the term Embryo, how- ever, being chiefly applied to it, in the earlier stages of its existence. * The end of the ninth month after Conception, which is the natural Period of Birth, is often denominated the Full Time.

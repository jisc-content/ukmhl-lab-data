140 SUBSTANCE OF THE BRAIN. Matter, covered with a coating of Wood-Brown, from a tenth to a twelfth of an inch in thickness. It is necessary, before endeavouring to give a general idea of the Nervous Matter in the Annular Protuberance, to fix the limits of this Protuberance behind, a little more precisely. A heart-shaped surface was formerly described when view- ing the Cerebellum from above, formed by the section which separates the Cerebellum from the Brain Proper. If a line be drawn, on each side, from the point of the receding angle which was taken notice of on that surface, backwards and outwards, to the groove which divides the Annular Protu- berance from the Pillar of the Vieussenian Valve, these two lines will mark the boundaries of the Protuberance on this surface behind. Again, if from this boundary above, a sec- tion be supposed to be made, downwards to the inferior mar- gin of the Protuberance, with the same degree of curvature nearly as the anterior surface of the Protuberance has, but curved in an opposite direction, all the parts cut off' by this imaginary section before, may be regarded as belonging to the Annular Protuberance. Now the Nervous Matter of this Protuberance is chiefly if not entirely of the White kind ; the quantity of Brown, I believe, will be found to be exceedingly small. The White Matter in it, however, is of two kinds; one sort appears Orange-White when divided vertically, but Greyish when cut in the horizontal direction; the other is Orange- White only in a horizontal section, and Greyish when divid- ed vertically. It is this dark colour of certain sections of the White Matter, I have no doubt, which has led to the idea, that the Protuberance contains so large a proportion of Brown Matter. Of the kind of White Matter which appears brightest in horizontal sections, there is, in the first place, a layer, vary- ing in thickness from a tenth to an eighth of an inch, which

CENTRAL FISSURE OF THE CEREBELLUM. 119 Spinal Lobule. It has a uniform and pretty considerable convexity; and consists of Lamina, of which the general direction corresponds to a curve, with the concavity looking forwards and inwards. The lower surface of the Posterior Lobe of the Cerebellum is slightly convex, and consists of Lamina which are con- tinued from those on the neighbouring surface of the In- ferior Lobes. In the Cerebellum, as in the Brain Proper, there is a fissure, which penetrates from the outer surface into the central parts, and which therefore may be called the Central Fissure of the Cerebellum. The opening of this Fissure is the slit already described at the upper and back part of the Spinal Fossa, immediately behind the lower and posterior margin of the Annular Pro- tuberance. The Fissure itself is of a conical shape, the plane of its base being nearly horizontal, and its apex, which is turned upwards and forwards, communicating with the Aqueduct of Sylvius, and consequently with the Central Fissure of the Brain Proper. It is symmetrical, and its Median Line corresponds with that of the Cerebellum. At its base, it measures from side to side, about an inch and a quarter, and from before backwards, between half an inch and three quarters. At its apex, it is about an eighth of an inch, in both these directions. The floor or lower side of this Fissure, is formed by the upper surface of the Head and Ala of the Inferior Vermi- form Process, already described. The upper and posterior side is smooth, and of a white colour. Towards the lower part, it is concave and closely applied to the floor of the Fissure; but as it ascends, it forms a gentle curve, with the convexity looking downwards and forwards. In this upper convex portion, we may distinguish a middle, and two lateral parts. The middle part is the

SKIN IN GENERAL. 23.3 as he conceives, for the transmission of Bloodvessels, and Exhalents, and Absorbents, and Nerves, to that surface. I believe, however, it will be found, that these pores are not perceptible in the recent skin; but that they are the effects of maceration. The Skin consists of two parts, placed one above the other, in the form of layers or laminae. The inner lamina is called True Skin * ; the outer, Cuticle, Epidermis, or Scarf-Skin. These two adhere to each other so closely, not only during Life, but in the recent Dead Body, that it is in vain to at- tempt separating them, without destroying either the one or the other. The method by which I have always found, that they may be detached from each other with most ease, and â€¢with the least injury to either, is, to preserve a piece of Skin, either on the recent subject or detached from it, carefully from moisture; and at the end of a week or ten days, or of a longer or shorter period, according to the state of the at- mosphere, such a degree of decomposition generally takes place, as enables one, by the gentlest pressure, with the point of the finger, in an oblique direction on the Cuticle, to separate it completely from the True Skin. Maceration in cold water, or plunging into boiling water, I do not find by any means well adapted for producing this separation ; the former process is always exceedingly tedious, and both injure the texture very much, of the parts which they sepa- rate. The True Skin, is that part of the Skin upon which its strength entirely depends. Its outer surface corresponds almost exactly in appear- ance, with the outer surface of the Skin, before the Cuticle has been removed. It presents precisely the same Fur- rows; and is only the slightest shade lighter in its colour. * Synonyms. Lai. Corium. Fr. Le Chorion.

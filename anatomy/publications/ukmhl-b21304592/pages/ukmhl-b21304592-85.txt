53 OVAL HOLE, &C. OF THE FOETAL HEART. f Traite, &c. 1. p. 227. was any difference between them, I have rather thought the superiority was with the Left. In the Heart of a Foetus, still-born, before the Full Time, Le Gallois* found that the Right Ventricle held only 34 grammes of Mercury, while the Left contained 37 ; and in another, still-born, about the seventh month, he found that the Left Ventricle held 34 grammes of Mercury, and the Right only 23. But I do not rest much on these experi- ments ; as it is doubtful whether they were performed in a satisfactory manner.. I think SENAct is right when he says that the Auricles are proportionally thicker and stronger in the Foetus than after- wards ; but I doubt whether he be equally correct in stating, that between the third and fourth month the sides of the left Ventricle are thinner than those of the Right. They have al- ways appeared to me thicker, as they are in the Adult; though less, in proportion, in the earlier months than towards Birth. The Serous Membrane in the Foetal Heart is so thin, that the course of the fibres in the Muscular Coat, below, and of the superficial Bloodvessels and Nerves, is easily seen through it. The Muscular Coat itself is softer, and lighter coloured. The Valve of the Oval Hole is said by many to consist of a doubling of the Inner Membrane of the Auricles ; but I suspect it would not be easy to demonstrate this, by separa- ting its two laminae distinctly from each other. It is similar, however, to this membrane in structure ; and in general does not exhibit any of those Muscular Fibres which are seen in the Oval Fossa of the Adult Heart. * Diction, des Sciences Medicales, V. p. 440.

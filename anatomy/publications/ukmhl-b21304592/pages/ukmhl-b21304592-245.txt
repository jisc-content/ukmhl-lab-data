ORIGINS OF TIIE SPINAL NERVES. 213 The lower Filaments lie close almost to the Cord; those farther up incline successively more and more outwards ; and the uppermost of all extend directly outwards. All those arising from the Cervical Portion of the Cord are pla- ced behind the Serrated Membrane; or between this Mem- brane, and the Posterior Fasciculi of the Cervical Nerves. Each Fasciculus or Filament is embraced by Pia Mater, as well as the trunk which they form, which is of a very compact texture. This trunk ascending gradually, and at same time inclining outwards, passes along the anterior sur- face of the Spinal Lobules of the Cerebellum ; and coming into contact with the Pneumo-gastric Nerve, just where that Nerve is perforating the Arachnoid Membrane, it pierces this Membrane along with it. There are connexions, occasionally, between the Accesso- ry Nerve and the Sub-occipital, as to the nature of which, I am not yet quite satisfied. Origins of the Sub-Occijrilal Nerves. The Sub-occipital Nerve arises, on each side, by two sets of Fasciculi, one from the anterior and the other from the posterior surface of the Spinal Cord, just where its Top passes into its Cervical Portion. The Anterior set, usually consists of from four to seven Fasciculi, arranged into two bundles. These arise at the distance of about a fifth of an inch from the Anterior Me- dian Fissure, one above the other in a straight line, and ex- tend outwards for about a third of an inch. The posterior set arises in a similar manner, within the same distance of the Posterior Median Fissure; but it consists usually of only three or four Fasciculi. Both sets obviously consist of Fasciculi of Filaments, sur- rounded individually and generally with a Neurilema of Pia Mater, continuous with that of the Cord. They extend 3

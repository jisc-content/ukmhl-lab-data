"kAIR IN GENERA'!/. 244 4 CHAPTER V. I- THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF HAIR. It is unnecessary to say any thing respecting the general appearance of the Hairs of the Human Body ; at least of that portion of them which projects beyond the surface of the Skin. I shall confine myself, therefore, to circumstan- ces which are less familiar. In every Hair, three parts may be distinguished; the Root, Middle Part, and Point. In the Root, I comprehend, not only that portion of the Hair which is contained in the Bulb, but the Portion which is lodged in the Skin ; in other words, all that part which is not seen externally. The Mid- dle Part and Point, are the parts which project beyond the surface of the Skin. By laying hold of a Hair with a pair of round-pointed forceps, and pulling gently, but steadily, its Root is gradual- ly detached from the Bulb and the Canal in the Skin, and it is extracted entire. This operation may be practised on the Living Body, with very little pain. On the Dead Body, it is the more easily accomplished, the farther decomposition has advanced between the Cuticle and True Skin. I have already remarked, that the Hairs are almost always extract- ed in this manner, along with the Epidermis, when it is peeled off from the True Skin. All the Hairs in the Body are cylindrical, and taper re- gularly from the Root to the Point. In affirming that they are conical, I do not trust to my own microscopical observa- tions alone; mv friend Dit. Brewster assures me, that he has always found them to be so. This circumstance, there- fore, affords the true explanation of the fact, said to have

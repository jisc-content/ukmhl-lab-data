DIFFERENCES IN THE BRAIN. 170 are the result of an Immense number of measurements of this organ, made apparently with the utmost accuracy, and with every attention to the usual sources of fallacy, in ex- periments of this nature. According to them, the total length of the Brain Proper, three months after Conception, is an inch and three lines; at Birth, four inches and two lines ; and at the seventh year, and from the seventh to the eightieth, between six and seven inches. The total breadth of the Brain Proper, three months after Conception, is an inch and one line; at Birth, from three inches and eight lines, to four inches and six lines; and at the seventh year, and from the seventh to the eight- ieth, from five inches, to six inches and five lines. It ap- pears, therefore, that the Brain Proper, increases rather more in length and breadth during the six months immediately preceding Birth, than during the first seven years after Birth ; that these dimensions arrive at their maximum at the age of seven; and that they suffer no change during the whole of after Life *. The total length of the Cerebellum at the third month after Conception, they found to be four lines; at Birth, an inch and six or eight lines ; at the seventh year, and during the whole of after Life, two inches and from two to eight lines -f-. Its total breadth at the third month after Concep- tion, tvas seven lines; at Birth, from two inches, to two in- ches and six lines; and at the seventh year, and during the remainder of Life, from three inches and nine lines, to four inches and four lines. The absolute increase, therefore, of the Cerebellum, as well as of the Brain Proper, in both di- mensions, is greater during the six months preceding Birth, than the seven years immediately succeeding it; at the seventh year the length and breadth have arrived at their i â€¢ De Penitior, &c. p. 295, 254. In this measurement, I presume, the Annular Protuberance is excluded.

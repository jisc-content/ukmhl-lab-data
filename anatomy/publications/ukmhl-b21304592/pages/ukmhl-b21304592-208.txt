The diameter from before backwards is also about four tenths of an inch at the upper part, but rather dimi- nishes than increases below. The remaining part of the Cord may be denominated the Dorsal Portion, as it is contained chiefly in the Dorsal Re- gion of the Spinal Canal. It is generally about fifteen in- ches in length. The upper part of it gradually tapers and becomes cylindrical as it descends, its diameter below being only about four tenths of an inch. Its middle part remains cylindrical, but is even a little narrower than the former. Its lower part widens out a little, at first, in its transverse diameter, and then gradually tapers to a point. I have never seen this portion, however, so large as the Cervical Portion ; nor have I ever observed that double swelling at its tapering extremity, which Soemmerring* and some other Anatomists have described- The Spinal Cord is perfectly symmetrical in the longitu- dinal direction, from before backwards ; consequently it is divisible into Right and Left Halves. A fissure runs along each surface of it, from one extre- mity to the other, exactly on the Median Line. These are called the Anterior and Posterior, Median Fissures of the Cord. The Anterior Fissure begins above, at a little tri- angular pit, just under the middle of the lower margin of the Annular Protuberance of the Cerebellum ; the Posterior, is continuous with the groove described p. 120, on the an- terior side of the Central Fissure of the Cerebellum. Both Fissures are widest and deepest in the Top of the Cord; where, in truth, from the convexity of the parts on each side of them, they form rather Furrows than Fissures. Their depth here, however, even at the deepest part, does not exceed an eighth of an inch. In the other portions of the Cord, they are as narrow as a hair; and I am very

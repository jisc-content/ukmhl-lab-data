201 THEIll CLASSIFICATION. I have examined, with considerable attention, some of the largest and most intimate Plexuses of Nerves, that occur in the Body; and yet I cannot say, that I have ever per- ceived the slightest appearance of any substance in them, similar to that which has just been described, filling up the interstices of the Ganglia. The subdivision of the Fasciculi which meet in a Plexus is sometimes pretty minute; but never so minute, it seems to me, as that which occurs in Ganglia. The structure of the Nerves, is, so far as I know, the same in the Female as in the Male. The state of the Nerves, with respect to general struc- ture, before and after Maturity, has not yet been properly investigated. There are some remarks on this subject by Bichat*, but they are very vague and unsatisfactory. Having thus considered the structure of the Nerves in general, it now only remains for me, in this Section, to enu- merate and classify the Primary Nerves; to describe the parts of the Central Mass from which they arise; and to follow them from their Origins, until they penetrate the Arachnoid Membrane. Their distribution beyond this, falls to be treated of, in other departments of the Work. The Central Mass of the Nervous System, we have seen, may be divided into two halves, Right and Left. From corresponding points in each half, forty-two Nerves arise; all differing more or less from each other, on the same side, but exactly similar, each to each, on the opposite sides. There are, therefore, eighty-four Primary Nerves in all, forming forty-two corresponding Pairs. Some of these arise from the Brain, others from the Spi- nal Cord; they may therefore, be divided into two classes, Cerebral and Spinal. * Anat, Gener. I. p. 197,

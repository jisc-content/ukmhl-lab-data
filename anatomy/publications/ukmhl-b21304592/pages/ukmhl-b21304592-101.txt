CHAPTER II. THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF THE ABSORBENT SYSTEM. In the Absorbent System of the Human Body, there are two tilings to be considered, viz. the Absorbent Vessels, and little bodies called Absorbent Glands, through which all these Vessels seem to pass, in some part of their course. SECTION I. THE ANATOMY OF THE ABSORBENT VESSELS IN GENERAL. The Absorbent Vessels are a system of tubes, distributed throughout the Body in the manner of the Arteries and Veins. In describing them, the same order is observed, as in the description of the distribution of the Veins. They are too minute at first to be perceptible to the na- ked eye ; but they unite one with one another into vessels successively increasing in size, until at last they form two trunks, each about a quarter of an inch in diameter, which open into the Subclavio-Jugular Veins, one on each side of the Neck. The Left Trunk is denominated the Tho- racic Duct. Very often, instead of two trunks, they form three; and sometimes, though rarely, we find four or five, These va- rieties, however, will be described more minutely after- wards.

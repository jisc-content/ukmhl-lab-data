44 PARTS composing the sides of the heart. * See Anatomy of Tendinous Substance. posed to peel in laminae; but no fibres arc perceptible in it â€¢, and so far as I know, no one has yet seen its Vessels or Nerves. It is firmly connected to the Muscular Coat by a fine Cellular Substance. The Eustachian Valve and the Valve of the Coronary Vein, appear to be formed of doublings of the Inner Mem- brane of the Auricle. The former, however, generally con- tains a fasciculus of Muscular Fibres at its basis, which is in- cluded between the folds of the Membrane. The structure of the Tricuspid and Mitral Valves is not so simple. A delicate prolongation of the Inner Membrane of the Auricles can indeed be easily traced over their inner surface ; but I have never been able to detect any similar continuation of the Membrane of the Ventricles over their outer surface. They seem to consist of a fine but dense web of slender fibres continued from the Tendinous Cords. These Cords, as their name imports, are composed of Ten- dinous Substance*; and after they have been inserted into the Valves-, they spread out and are interwoven within their substance fn every direction, as may be easily seen by hold- ing the Valves between the eye and the light. It is the inter- section of these Cords just after their insertionj that causes those knots and ridges on the Valves, which are so common, particularly towards the margin of the Mitral Valve. The Heart is supplied with Arteries entirely from two Arterial Trunks, denominated Coronary or Cardiac Arteries. These arise from the Aorta close to its origin, in a manner afterwards to be described. The Anterior Coronary Artery is seen, immediately behind the Tip of the Right Auricle, entering the top of the groove between this Auricle and the Right Ventricle. It then runs along in the bottom of this groove, until it reaches the furrow between the Ventricles on the inferior surface of the Heart

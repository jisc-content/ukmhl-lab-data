'108 SUBSTANCE OF THE BRAIN. The greater part of its external surface is formed into what are called Convolutions, but which in truth resemble the Convolutions of the Brain Proper, in nothing but in colour. They ought rather to be denominated the Lamina of the Cerebellum. They have the appearance of strata or layers, from a sixth to a twelfth of an inch thick, lying close to each other, though actually divided by Fissures varying in depth from the twentieth part of an inch to an inch ; and when these layers are gently separated from each other, the surfaces of each of them, are found to exhibit the same Â» laminated appearance. This is one of those pieces of struc- ture, however, which it is impossible to convey any accurate idea of, by words. When we view the Cerebellum from above, we observe in the first place, on the Median Line, and on the forepart, the surface of the section by which it is separated from the Brain Proper. It is sufficient to remark with respect to this surface, that it is heart-shaped ; and that the receding angle at the base which looks forwards, is formed by the lower surface of the extremity of the Triangular Furrow, between the Peduncles of the Brain Proper, already described ; while close to its apex, a small triangular hole is seen, which is a cross section of the lower end of the Aqueduct of Sylvius. The posterior half of this heart-shaped surface is bounded by a Semilunar Fossa; and immediately behind this Fossa, there is an eminence which I should be inclined to call the Mons Cerebelli. The anterior surface of this eminence rises, perpendicularly, to the height of a quarter of an inch, above the level of the heart-shaped surface just decribed ; while behind, and on each side, it passes by a gradual declivity into the Median Fossa, and into the slight concavities which present themselves, on the upper surface of each Hemisphere. It is composed of Lamina of which the general direction is transverse to the MedianLine, but with certain irregularities,

At various parts, too, particularly at the Basis of the Brain, it is perforated for the transmission of Bloodvessels and Nerves. Bichat * has described the Arachnoid Membrane as con- tinued from the outer surface of the Brain Proper into its Central Fissure. He says, it enters this Fissure, by a small opening just under the posterior extremities of the Corpus Callosum ; and that it immediately embraces the Choroid Membrane and Plexuses; lines the whole surface of the Ven- tricles in the form of a shut sac; and is then prolonged, through the Aqueduct of Sylvius, into the Central Fissure of the Cerebellum. I have often sought, however, for this continuation, but in vain ; and am rather inclined to suspect, that Bichat has fallen into an error in this instance, from his eagerness to establish an analogy between the Arachnoid Membrane and those Membranes, in other parts of the Body, which are called Serous. I am even doubtful, whether there be any Membrane lining the Ventricles at all; notwith- standing the minute description of a very delicate covering of this nature, which has lately been given, by the accurate and indefatigable Wenzels -f*. It does not appear to me clear, that the substance they have described as a Membrane, is not merely a thin, dense, stratum of Nervous Matter. The Arachnoid Membrane, is, as its name imports, as thin as cobweb; dense, colourless, and almost perfectly transparent. Its outer surface is quite smooth; its inner more or less thready or flocculent, according to its connec- tion with the Pia Mater,

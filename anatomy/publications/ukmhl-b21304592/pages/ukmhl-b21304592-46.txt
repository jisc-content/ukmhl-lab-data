External form of the body. 14 In an Embryo of about nine weeks, there is a projection in the Region of the Nose; part of the Auricles is formed ; the Toes have appeared ; the Pudenda begin to be distin- guished ; and the Coccygeal Protuberance has vanished. After this, considerable changes take place in the Exter- nal appearance of the Foetus, in proportion as the developc- ment of the different parts advances ; but it would be im- possible to convey an idea of these without the assistance of engravings. Hair generally begins to appear on the Eye- brows and in the Regions of the Hindhead and Temples, about the end of the fifth month. According to the observations of Soemmerring, the younger the Foetus, the larger is its Head compared to the other parts of its Body, the smaller its Face in proportion to the other parts of the Head, and the smaller its Limbs relatively to the Trunk. During the first, second, and third months, he has remarked that the Upper Extremities are larger than the Lower; but that about the fourth, they are equal; and that towards the fifth, the Lower have be- come larger than the Upper. The same excellent author has pointed out the following distinctions, in External Form, between the Male and the Female Fcetus. The Head of the Male differs from that of the Female, in being larger in proportion to the whole Body, less rounded, flatter in the Crown, and more pro- minent behind. Tn the Male, the Breast is considerably more prominent than the Umbilical Region, while in the Female it is the reverse; and this is a distinction which is very perceptible even in the youngest Foetuses. The Trunk of the Body, between the upper parts of the Loins, is arched in the Male, while in the Female it exhibits a depression ; and this, too, is a difference, which Soemmerring has remark- ed at a very early period after Conception. The Upper Ex- tremities in the Male are a little longer, in proportion to the Trunk, than in the Female; the Arms are less cylindrical;

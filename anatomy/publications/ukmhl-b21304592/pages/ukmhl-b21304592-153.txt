ITS COMPOSITION-WHITE AND BROWN NERVOUS MATTER. 121 It is difficult to convey any accurate.idea of the consis- tence of the White Nervous Matter. It varies a little in different parts. In general it is less elastic than Jelly, but somewhat more glutinous or viscid. When we make a section of it in any direction, with a sharp scalpel, the surface of the section is perfectly smooth, and of a uniform colour. There is no appearance of any cells, or globules, or fibres whatever. Here and there, only, Ave observe a few reddish points and stria;, which are obviously occasioned by the transverse or longitudinal division of small Bloodvessels. This substance seems to have been subjected to very mi- nute microscopical examination by Prochaska*. When he took a small portion of it, either from the Brain Proper or Cerebellum, and spread it out on a very thin plate of glass, so that it became pellucid, and then examined it with a powerful microscope, he found that it resembled a sort of pulp, consisting of innumerable globules, or particles of a roundish form. A little water added to this pulp divided it into a number of Jlocculi; but he observed that each floc- culus was still composed of a number of globules. He very rarely found one globule by itself, or even two, floating in the water, apart from the rest. Maceration in water, even for three months, was insufficient to separate them from each other. He concluded therefore, that they were united by means of a very delicate and pellucid Cellular Substance, insoluble in water, and formed partly of blood-vessels, and partly of prolongations of the Pia Mater. The globules, he observed, were not all of the same size; but varied a little in dimension, even in the same part of the Brain. In general, however, he found them, both in the Brain Proper, and in the Cerebellum, to be more than eight times smaller than a globule of tlie Blood. Respecting their structure, the most * Oper.

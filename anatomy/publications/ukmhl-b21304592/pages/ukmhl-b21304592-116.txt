SUBSTANCE OF THE BEAIN. Si an inch broad, and the same in thickness. In colour, it is a little darker than the Convolutions. In point of situation, it is the lowest part of the Brain Proper placed on the Median Line; its superior surface being below the level of the lowest margin of the Commissure of the Tractus Optici. It is altogether unconnected with any other part, except in the middle of its flat surface, where it is joined to the point of the Infundibulum. The Infundibulum* is a small projection of a conical shape, the base turned upwards and backwards, and the apex downwards and forwards. It is rather more than half an inch in length. Its colour is brownish like the Convolutions. Its basis is connected on the fore part to the Commissure of the Tractus Optici, and laterally and behind, to the Tractus Optici themselves, and to the Mammillary Eminences. Its apex is inserted into the middle of the upper surface of the Pituitary Gland. Immediately behind the Mammillary Eminences, there is seen the upper end of a deep Triangular Furrow, three eighths of an inch in length and the same in breadth, which extends downwards and a very little backwards, and is ter- minated by the Annular Protuberance of the Cerebellum. The upper end of this Furrow presents a smooth, flat, sur- face, of a whitish colour, pierced with a number of small holes. The lower end projects downwards a considerable way, behind the Annular Protuberance of the Cerebellum, and forms a small cul-de-sac, shaped like the point of a writing-pen. In describing the lower surface of the Brain Proper, I suppose the Cerebellum to have been cut away. Now, im- - mediately behind the cavity just mentioned, and about a quarter of an inch lower down, the surface of the section is seen, which is made in removing the Cerebellum. This of course it is unnecessary to describe minutely. Synonym. Fr. La Tige Pituitairc.

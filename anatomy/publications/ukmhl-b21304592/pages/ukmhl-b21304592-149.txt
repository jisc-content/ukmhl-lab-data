LOWER SURFACE OF TIIE CEREBELLUM. 117 Close to the Protuberance, its height is about five eighths of an inch, but in the Fossa, it is scarcely more than an eighth. It is convex, smooth, and of a white colour. At its uppermost point, and just where it is continued into the Protuberance, the lower portion of the Trigeminal Nerve is attached to it. The attachment occupies an elliptical space about a fifth of an inch in length, and in general bounded both above and below by a slight ridge; and the upper- most half of this ridge always intervenes between the at- tachment of the upper and the lower portion of the Nerve. The Facial Nerve is attached to the lowermost point of this surface, close to its junction with the Protuberance; the connection, occupying a circular space scarcely a twelfth of an inch in diameter. And an eighth of an inch from this, in a direction outwards, backwards, and downwards, is seen a space about twice the size of the former, which serves for the attachment of the Auditory Nerve. Lastly, there is a small surface of the Peduncle which looks directly downwards. This is bounded, before, by the surface just described; behind, by the Spinal Cord ; on the inside, by the Protuberance; and without, by the Sub-pe- duncular Lobule. It is of an oblong shape, measuring about a quarter of an inch in length, and a fifth in breadth. Two white ridges are seen on it, running, from the spaces described on the former surface as giving attachment to the Facial and Auditory Nerves, backwards and inwards. Attached to the lower part of the Peduncle, immediately to the outside of the connection of the Auditory Nerve, is the small eminence which I have called the Sub-peduncular Lobule*. This, in general, is about three quarters of an inch in length, and from a quarter to a third of an inch in breadth at its outer end, which is the largest. The upper â€™Synonym. Ft.

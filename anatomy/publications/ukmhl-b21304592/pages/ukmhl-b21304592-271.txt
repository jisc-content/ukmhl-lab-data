239 SKIN IN GENERAL. of, and the same opinion entertained with respect to them by Ivaau*. Cruiksiiank*}- conceived, that, if they were not Vessels, they were exceedingly fine processes of the Cuticle, which lined the smallest pores of the True Skin. But I can have no doubt, after repeated examination of them, that these filaments are neither Vessels nor processes of Epider- mis; but that they are merely threads of that mucous mat- ter, which always forms between the Cuticle and True Skin after Death, in consequence of decomposition. Similar fi- laments may be produced, at pleasure, by placing a small quantity of any viscid substance between two plates of glass, and then gently separating the plates from each other. When Cuticle is dried, it diminishes in bulk, but be- comes firmer, more elastic, and somewhat yellower. Precisely the opposite effects are produced by maceration in Cold Water. It swells out a little, is rendered softer and less elastic, and acquires a considerable degree of whiteness and opacity. It is a substance, however, which imbibes water very slowly. It is not until after long continued im- mersion of the Hands or Feet in water, that the Cuticle of the Palms or Soles, takes up enough of this fluid, to render it white and opaque ; and yet I suspect, that the Epidermis of these Regions imbibes moisture more readily, than that of any other part of the Body. This is the reason, obvi- ously, that the fluids of Blisters or Vesications in the Liv- ing Body, are so long of escaping; and that the Skin of the Dead Body is so long of drying, even in the driest atmo- sphere, provided the Cuticle has not been removed from it. This property of the Epidermis, was first pointed out by Dr. Hunter When plunged into Boiling Water, Cuticle scarcely suf- fers any apparent change at first; but after a little while, s â€¢ Perspiratio Dicta Hippocrati, p. 42. f Experiments, See. p. 25.

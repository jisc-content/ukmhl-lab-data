OVAL HOLE OF THE FOETAL HEART. 51 the space included within the line of its insertion; so that it admits of being pushed a considerable way towards the cavity of the Left Auricle, from the Septum and the Hole. When this is done, a short canal is formed, between the upper part of the Valve and the portion of the Septum im- mediately above the Oval Hole, opening into the Left Au- ricle by an Orifice, of which the floating edge of the Valve forms fully two thirds. Through this canal, of course, the Auricles may communicate; but I have been much pleas- ed to observe, (Physiology makes the application of the fact,) that the axis of this canal corresponds exactly, in every in- stance, with the axis of the Inferior Cava Vein; and that the Valve forms as it were the posterior side of this Vein continued. Whether there be any period prior to the fourth month, at which the Oval Hole exists in the Heart of the Foetus without the Valve, or at which the Valve is smaller, I have not yet had satisfactory means of ascertaining. But Hal- ler* mentions, that his friend Bergen had found no Valve in a Foetus of two months: And Senac + believes that' there is none prior to this at least; and expresses himself certain, that, if its rudiments exist at two months, they are extreme- ly small. After this period, however, according to him, it grows by degrees, and its margin approaches nearer and nearer to the upper border of the Hole. It is very probable that this description is correct; but as I have found, that the Valve even in the fourth month is very easily broken down, unless the Heart be dissected with great care, nothing but actual observation will satisfy me on this point. The Hole and the Valve remain pretty nearly in the state * Elem. Physiol. VIII. pars. 1. p.G75. f Traite, &c, I. p. 20], 2

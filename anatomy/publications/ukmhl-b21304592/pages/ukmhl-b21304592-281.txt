249 HAITI IN GENERAL. ashes of White Hair yielded still less. These last, however, contained a great deal of Magnesia; at least a great deal with respect to the other ingredients; for the Hair scarcely yielded above .015 of ashes. The Bulbs of the Human Hair are so minute, that it is not easy to ascertain any thing respecting them, except their form. This varies a good deal in different regions of the Body. In some they are spherical, in others pyriform; but for the most part they are cylindrical. They have a slightly greyish colour, which enables us to distinguish them the more easily, among the Cellular and Adipose Substance, in which they are imbedded. Judging by analogy, from the structure of the Bulbs of those large Hairs, which form the whiskers of such Ani- mals as the Seal, I should imagine, that the Bulbs of the Human Hair consisted of two Coats or Tunics; an inner one, of a tender consistence, and very Vascular, embracing immediately the Root of the Hair; and an outer one, close- ly surrounding this, firmer, and less Vascular. The Bulbs of the Hairs, are always situated under the True Skin; but so close to its inner surface, that no part of the Hair is perceptible, between it and the Bulb. Im- mediately after leaving the Bulb, the Hair is received into a Canal in the True Skin, which is constantly observed to be more or less oblique. A small hole in the Cuticle cor- responds to this Canal; and the Hair passing through it also, reaches the outer surface of the Skin. In its passage through the True Skin, I believe, that it adheres to the sides of the canal just as Epidermis would do; and in pierc- ing the Cuticle, it seems to me most probable, that the sides of the hole by which it penetrates, are intimately unit- ed with it. The differences in the Human Hair corresponding to Sex and to Age, are so familiar to every one, that they do not require pointing out.

218 THE NERVES IN GENERAL. The First Lumbar inclines more downwards than the Twelfth Dorsal Nerve, and the inclination increases from the First to the Fifth. The First Lumbar Nerve measures, from its Origin to its perforation of the Arachnoid Membrane, nearly three inches; and the rest are longer in succession; the Fifth being more than five inches. Of the Sacral Nerves in Particular.â€”The Origins of these Nerves occupy the remaining part of the Spinal Cord. Both their Roots arise a very little nearer to the Median Fissures than those of the Lumbar Nerves. In point of number of Fasciculi, both at their immediate Origin, and at their perforation of the Arachnoid Mem- brane, their Roots are the same as those of the Lumbar Nerves. In point of size, the Fasciculi of the Anterior and of the Posterior Roots, are pretty much the same in all of them. The Fasciculi of the First and Second Sacral Nerves, are as large as -the Anterior Root of the Fifth Lumbar Nerve; but those of the Third, are only half the size of the Second ; those of the Fourth, half the size of the Third; and those of the Fifth, half the size of the Fourth. Those of the Fifth, in consequence, are only about a fortieth part of an inch in diameter. All the Roots, Anterior and Posterior, arise close to each other. They have all a greater inclination downwards than the Lumbar Nerves, and they incline the more, the lower they are; so that the Last Sacral Nerve, is almost parallel to that thread-like prolongation from the Pia Mater covering the extremity of the Cord, which was described p. 187. The length of the First Sacral Nerve, from its Origin to its perforation of the Arachnoid Membrane, is about five inches and a half; that of the Fifth, about eight inches.

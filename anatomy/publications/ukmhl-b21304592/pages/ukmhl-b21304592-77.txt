STRUCTURE OF THE VALVES.â€”CARDIAC ARTERIES. 45 Into this, it turns at a right angle, and following its direc- tion, terminates towards the Apex. During1 the whole of this course, it is situated between O the Serous Membrane, and the Muscular Coat, and is often surrounded with Adipose Substance. It gives off numerous branches to the Right, which are small, and supply the Right Auricle, some of them extending to the Cavae. Branch- es equally numerous and greatly larger are sent off to the left, and are seen running in a tortuous manner, and rami- fying on the surface of the Right Ventricle, from the basis towards the point. The largest of these, in general, runs along, immediately above the anterior acute margin of the Heart; and, several of its branches anastomose towards the Apex, with branches of the Posterior Coronary Artery. Just where the Anterior Coronary, too, is turning into the groove between the Ventricles, it sends off a pretty large branch, which is continued on into the furrow between the Left Auricle and Ventricle, and extends as far as the posterior margin of the Heart, giving off branches to the Auricle and Ventricle, in the same manner as the trunk from Vhich it is derived. All the branches of the Anterior Coronary Artery, which are distributed on the Ventricles, run at first between the Serous Membrane and the Muscular Coat; and it is not until they have ramified in this situation to the smallness of a pin, that they dip down between the Muscular fibres. The Posterior Coronary Artery enters the furrow between the Ventricles on the upper surface of the Heart, immedi- ately before the Tip of the Left Auricle. It runs along this furrow, winds round the Apex of the Heart, and ter- minates along with the Anterior Coronary on the inferior surface. J ust after entering the groove, this Artery gives off a branch, which gets into the furrow between the Left Auri- cle and Ventricle, and runs round until it meets with the

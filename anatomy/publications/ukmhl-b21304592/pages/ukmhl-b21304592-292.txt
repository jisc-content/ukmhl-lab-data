It is in every respect the same in the Female as in the Male. I know of no differences in its Anatomy corresponding to Age. CHAPTER X. TIIE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE. Synovial Membrane resembles Serous Membrane, in so far as it is a thin substance, having one smooth, free, surface, turned towards certain cavities of the Body, and another, connected by delicate Cellular Substance to the sides of these cavities, or to the parts contained in them. It re- sembles this substance also in being transparent. But it differs from Serous Membrane in the following cir- cumstances. In the first place, it is a substance possessing very little Vascularity in its healthy state. None of its Bloodvessels are almost ever seen filled with Blood after Death, nor can they be made to receive the finest injection. In the second place, its Absorbents are quite incapable of demonstration. Thirdly, very delicate fibres, like those of Cellular Substance, or like the finest filaments of Tendon, are distinctly perceptible in it after slight maceration. Fourthly, it is not so strong as Serous Membrane*. I have not investigated its Chemical Properties. * I am very doubtful, whether all the circumstances in which these two Tex- tures are said to differ from each other by Bichat (Anat. Gener. IV. p. 537), be well founded. At all events, it seems to me, that none of them can, with any propriety, be adopted as the grounds of an Anatomical distinction.

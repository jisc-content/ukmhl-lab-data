VEINS IN GENERAL. (is Bichatâ€™s* description of the structure of Veins, is not so good as that which he has given of the Arteries; yet it approaches nearer to accuracy than any I have seen. He calls the Outer Coat Tissu Cellulaire, observing at same time, however, that it is very different from common Cellular Substance. The Inner Coat he describes under the name of Membrane Commune du Sang Noir; and the Texture mentioned, as intervening between the Outer and Inner Coats, at certain parts, he calls Membrane Propre aux Veines. There seem to be no Peculiarities in the Venous System of the Female, more than in the Arterial. Previously to Maturity, I believe it to be sufficiently es- tablished, that the Veins of the Body in general, are small- er in proportion to the Arteries than afterwards; and that the difference is greater the younger the subject. But the increase in the proportional size of the Venous System, which is conceived by some to take place during the Decline of Life, is, I apprehend, more apparent than real. Before concluding the consideration of the Anatomy of Bloodvessels in general, it may be proper to mention, that when the Arteries or Veins of any part of the Body happen to be either longer, or wider, or more numerous, than those of any other part, the former part is said to be more Vascu- lar than the latter. * Anat.

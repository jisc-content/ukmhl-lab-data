125 WHITE NERVOUS MATTER. in appearance like fresh cheese. This remaining part, form's about 7 per cent, of the substance employed, and is perfectly identical with Albumen. The alcohol employed in the digestion, deposits on cool- ing, a substance, white and solid, but soft and of a pitchy consistence; having a brilliant and sattiny appearance, a greasy and glutinous feel, and staining paper in the same manner as oils do. It resembles tallow or fat more than any other matter; but differs from common fat principally in its solubility in alcohol, its capacity of chrystallizing, its viscidity, its inferior fusibility, and the black colour which it assumes in melting. It forms about 4^ per cent, of the Nervous Matter analysed. If the Alcohol after depositing this Fatty Matter be eva- porated, it leaves a yellow aqueous liquor, at the bottom of which is an oily substance, of a reddish brown colour. This oily substance differs from the Fatty Matter depo- sited from the Alcohol on cooling, only in having a darker â€¢olour, less consistence, a greater tendency to chrystaliiza- tion, and a slight taste of boiled meat; differences which Yauuueltn thinks are owing to its being mixed with a small quantity of Osmazome. The Nervous Matter analysed, yields about 0.70 per cent, only of this Fatty Matter. The Yellow Aqueous liquor, at the bottom of which this reddish Fatty Matter is found, has the taste of the juice of meat with a little sweetness; reddens litmus; and is preci- pitated by lime water and infusion of nutgalls. The precipitate obtained by adding lime-water to this- liquid, is Phosphate of Lime. After this precipitation has been completed, if the re- maining liquor be evaporated to dryness, a matter will be ob- tained of a reddish-brown colour, and semi-transparent; and having the taste and smell, and all the chemical characters, of the substance called, by IIoueli.e, the Saponaceous Ex- tract of meat, and, by Thenard, Osmazome.

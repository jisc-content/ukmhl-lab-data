ITS COMPOSITION-WHITE â€¢ & BROWN NERVOUS MATTER. 183 In the mean time, I may observe, that the whole of the Cervical and Dorsal Portions, and the lower part of the Top, of the Cord, consist of a Central Column of Greyish-Brown Matter, surrounded by a Stratum of Orange-White. Some idea of the Central Column may be given, by describing it as four-sided and rectangular, the sides looking backwards and forwards, right and left; with a slender Wing projecting outwards from each angle, the anterior turning a little back- wards, and the posterior a little forward, so that the sides of the Column present a semilunar surface, concave out- wards. The middle part of the Column measures, in ge- neral, about a tenth of an inch in both directions. The posterior Wings are about a fifth of an inch in length ; the anterior ones, a little shorter. In thickness, both of them are about a twentieth of an inch at their base, but taper to about a fiftieth of an inch as they proceed outwards. The appearance, however, and situation of the Column at its commencement above, is peculiar. If we trace it from the Cervical Portion of the Cord upwards, we find, that as soon as it gains the Top of the Cord, it inclines backwards in its ascent; and having reached the apex of the Triangu- lar Fossa, it splits into two parts, one of which runs up on each side of the Posterior Median Fissure. Here they are covered only by a very thin layer of Yellowish-White Ner- vous Matter; through which they may be distinctly traced to their termination. It is they which cause those narrow spaces of a darker colour, on each side of the Median Fis- sure, which were taken notice of p. 179, in the description of the Triangular Fossa. The Central Column, therefore, may be said to begin in the Triangular Fossa of the Top of the Cord. The stratum of Orange-White Matter which surrounds this Column, is of course thinnest opposite the Median Fis- sures, and thickest, laterally, between the Wings of the Co- lumn.

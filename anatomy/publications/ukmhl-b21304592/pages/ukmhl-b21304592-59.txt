BOOK I. OF THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF THE COMMON SYSTEMS. CHAPTER I OF THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF THE CIRCULATING SYSTEM. This System consists of two parts; an Organ called the Heart, and a series of Tubes denominated Bloodvessels, com- municating with this Organ. I shall treat of each of these separately. Before entering on the consideration of either, however, it may be proper to apprise the reader, that no remarks are introduced into this Chapter, respecting the relative posi- tion, either of the Heart or of the Bloodvessels, to other or- gans. These properly belong to another Part of the Work. At present, we must confine ourselves, in all that relates to situation, merely to the consideration of general aspect. These observations apply equally, to the succeeding Chap- ters on the Absorbent and Nervous Systems.

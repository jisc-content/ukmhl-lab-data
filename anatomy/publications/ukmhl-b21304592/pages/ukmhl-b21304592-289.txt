257 TENDON IN GENERAL. Its shining, silvery, appearance, distinguishes it from every other Texture in the Body. Its distribution is very various, and very extensive. It forms not only those appendages to Muscular Fasciculi called Tendons, from which it has received its name, but also Ligaments; coverings to Bone and Cartilage, denomi- nated Periosteum and Perichondrium ; Aponeuroses, Fascia, Membranes, &c. It possesses very little elasticity, but it is very flexible, and by far the toughest texture in the Body. It appears to be chiefly composed of very delicate, white, silvery looking fibres, which are first collected into Fasci- culi of different sizes, and then these are united together in various ways. Sometimes a piece of Tendon is formed of a number of such Fasciculi, of considerable size, tied to- gether longitudinally, by Fasciculi so much smaller, that they are not seen unless the larger ones be pulled a little from each other. At other times, the Fasciculi are inter- woven with each other, almost with the same regularity as the threads of a piece of cloth. At other times, again, they cross and intersect each other in every direction, forming a close, compact texture, which it is impossible to separate either into laminas or threads. I have never tried to discover, how minutely the Tendinous Fibres might be subdivided ; but it is no difficult matter to obtain them, by careful ma- ceration in water, more delicate than the filaments of silk. A few Bloodvessels may often be seen on the surface of a piece of Tendon after Death, even where no injection has been employed. After successful injection with Size and Vermilion, a good many more are generally brought into view ; and if the piece of Tendon be dried and plunged into Spirit of Turpentine, the transparency which it imme- diately acquires, enables us to trace several of them into its Substance. In its natural state, however, Tendon is among the least vascular of the Textures. VOL. i. 9

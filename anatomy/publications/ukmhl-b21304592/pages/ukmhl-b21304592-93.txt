ARE COMPOSED OF THREE COATS. G1 scription, though objectionable in several points, is much su- perior to any that had been given befoiâ€™e him. It is usual to describe the Arteries as possessing, what is called a Cellular Coat, external to all the others. But there seems no more reason for admitting the Cellular Sub- stance which surrounds an Artery, to be a part of that Ar- tery, than there is for considering the Cellular Substance which is often laid over a Muscle, as a part of that Muscle. Besides, the three Coats which have been described, are con- stant ; whereas, a Cellullar covering, is found only on some of the Arteries. In general, I suspect, the true External Coat is confounded with this Celular covering, and so, in reality, overlooked altogether. Bichat, however, although he calls the Outer Coat of an Artery Tissu Cellulaire, dis- tinctly states that it is not cellular in its structure. When an Artery becomes smaller than the twelfth of an inch, it is not easy to distinguish the different parts which compose it. There is every reason to believe, however, that a similar structure is continued into the minutest branches. Microscopic observation, as far as it goes, is in favour of this opinion. I am not acquainted with any peculiarity, in the structure of the Arterial System of the Female. The only well established difference in the general Ana- tomy of the Arterial System, previously to the period of Maturity, is, the much greater absolute size of the capillary branches. This is always the more remarkable, the young- er the subject. I he reverse is the case, in the Decline of Life ; for then the capillary vessels become gradually smaller than in the Adult. At this period too, all the Arteries in the Body seem to suffer a diminution both in their strength and elasticity.

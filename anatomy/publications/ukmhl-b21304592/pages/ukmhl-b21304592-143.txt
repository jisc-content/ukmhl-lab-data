UrPER SURFACE OF THE CEREBELLUM. Ill rieties, however, not unfrequently occur in the breadth and inclination of the bands ; and, very often, they are crossed at right angles, by a slight fissure running along the Me- dian Line, from top to bottom, and dividing them into two halves, right and left. On each side of this posterior surface of the Vieussenian Valve, and continuous with it, there is a smooth, white, rounded ridge, called the Pillar of the Vieussenian Valve*, which runs upwards and forwards, forming a gentle curve, of which the concavity looks upwards and backwards. It arises close to the root of that sloping surface of the Anterior Lobe, already described on each side of the Vermiform Process ; and is connected above to the Lateral Ridge of the Inferior Corpus Bigeminum, and to the outer and lower border of the Cwpus Begiminum itself. A furrow, pretty broad below, but narrow above, separates its outer border from the Peduncle of the Cerebellum. Its length is about three fourths of an inch; but owing to the conical shape of the Vieussenian Valve, it is narrower below than above. At its broadest part, which is just under the Inferior Corpus Bigeminum, it is about half an inch. Immediately under the middle of the Lower Corpus Bigeminum, and about an eighth of an inch from the Vieussenian Valve, the Pathetic or Fourth Cranial Nerve is attached to it. Not unfrequently two or three brownish coloured band?, precisely similar to those of the Vieussenian Valve, and partly continuous with these, partly with the Middle Lamina of the Upper Vermiform Process, are found crossing it close to its root. External to the Pillar of the Vieussenian Valve on each side, is seen the upper surface of the Peduncle of the Cere- bellum ; but we shall reserve the description of this, until we come to view the other aspects of the Peduncles.

CENTRAL FISSURE OF THE BRAIN PROPER. 97 On the lower surface of the Middle Part, we observe in the first place on the Median Line, the body called the Pineal Gland*. This is a substance of which the form and dimensions vary a good deal; but in general it is of a co- nical shape, the base being turned directly forwards, and the apex backwards; and has two flattened surfaces, of which the one looks upwards, and the other downwards. Its length is from a quarter to three eighths of an inch, its breadth about a quarter, and its thickness an eighth. It is always of a greyish colour. It is unconnected with the surrounding parts, except at its base. To the upper border of its base, a narrow white plate is attached, which is continued at each extremity into a ridge on the Thalami Optici, called the Peduncle of the Pineal Gland; while the lower border sends off another and a much broader white lamina, also connected laterally with the Tha- lami, but extending downwards and forwards, and then sud- denly turning backwards, to be continued into the Connect- ing Plate of the Upper Corpora Bigemina. The anterior surface of this lower lamina is quite smooth ; and cannot be seen without removing the Thalami Optici to a level with it. From the doubling which it forms, it looks from be- fore like a little white cord. The posterior surface is gene- rally formed into slight transverse furrows, and is best ex- posed by turning the Pineal Gland forwards. It is the lower portion of this lamina, which is usually de- scribed under the name of the Posterior Commissure of the' Brain Proper. This name, however, may be given to the whole of it; for there is, in truth, no distinction among its parts. Immediately underneath the Pineal Gland, and support- ing it, there is a smooth, triangular, and slightly concave, surface, with its base turned forwards and its apex back- wards. This is the upper surface of a thin lamina which is * SvNoNrM. Lat. Conarium. VOL. I. H

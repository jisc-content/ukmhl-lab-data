SUBSTANCE OF THE SPINAL CORD. 132 it had rather the appearance ol' a little tubercle than a Membrane. The substance of the Spinal Cord is composed entirely of Nervous Matter; differing but very little, apparently, from the Nervous Matter of the Brain. Both species of this Matter occur in it. The White Matter is chiefly of the Orange-White kind; and from a considerable number of observations, made upon the Cord soon after death, I am inclined to agree with Chaussier *, that this Matter is firmer in its consistence, than the same substance, in any part of the Brain, except the Annular Protuberance. According to Piiochaska -f-, the globules it exhibits under the microscope, are of the same size with those seen in the Brain; but the Wenzels Â£ ra- ther think they are a little smaller; and this corresponds with the few observations I have myself made. It is coa- gulated, and rendered very firm, by Alcohol, Acids, &c.; and when it is torn in this state, it exhibits, in most parts, a very distinct fibrous appearance. According to Vauq.ue- Lin, when treated chemically with Alcohol, in the manner already described p. 124, it yields much more Fatty Mat- ter, but less Albumen and Ozmazome, than the Nervous Matter of the Brain. The Brown Nervous Matter in the Cord, is chiefly of the Greyish kind. The arrangement of these two kinds of Matter in the Spinal Cord, has not hitherto been either described, or re- presented, with sufficient accuracy. I shall endeavour, on some future occasion, to supply this deficiency, by means of engravings; verbal description in such cases not being (sufficiently precise. * Exposit. Sommaire, p. 116, Oper.

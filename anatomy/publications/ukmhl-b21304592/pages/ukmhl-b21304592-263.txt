SKIN IN GENERAL. 831 Muscle is uniformly observed to be paler, and softer, in young persons than in the Adult; and more so in pro- portion to their youth. I confess, too, I can have little doubt, that the Primary Fibres are actually more slender in the earlier periods of Life than afterwards. It will also be found, I presume, that in Man, as well as in Quadru- peds, the Muscle of young subjects, yields a much greater quantity of Gelatine, proportionally, to boiling water, and less Fibrine, than of Full Grown persons. In the Decline of Life, Muscle becomes paler again, and distinctly more delicate in its Primary Fasciculi, than in the Adult. In all probability, too, its Primary Fibres dimi- nish. CHAPTER IV. THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OP SKIN. This general integument of the Body, vai-ies in its thick- ness, from about a fifth to a twentieth of an inch. It is exceedingly tough, and is by far the most elastic of all the softer Textures. The appearance of its external surface I suppose to be familiar to every one. Furrows of different sizes are per- ceptible on it. The largest of these, are such as are seen in the Palm of the Hand, forming an appearance somewhat like the letter M; or opposite the joints of the Fingers. Specimens of almost all the lesser kinds, may be perceived, on the back of the Hand. These intersect each other in every direction ; leaving spaces of various forms between them. All these Furrows are made shallower by distend- ing the Skin ; the lesser ones disappearing altogether, when the distention is considerable.

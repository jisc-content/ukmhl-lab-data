NERVOUS MATTER OF PARTICULAR PARTS. 145 wanting altogether; so that at this point, the White Mat- ter forming its nucleus, is connected directly, with the White Matter belonging: to the Pillar of the Vieussenian Valve on the same side. I have invariably found the nucleus of this body composed of pure Orange-White Matter, not differing in colour in the slightest degree from that of the Central Mass in general. Its Venous Vessels, however, are considera- bly larger than they are in this matter in other parts; and I have no doubt, that it has been the accidental tinge com- municated to it by the division of these Vessels, or by the transudation of Blood from them, which has led some Anato- mists, to describe the nucleus as being intermixed with Brown Matter. The capsule appears to differ, in no respect, from the Wood-Brown Matter found in other parts of the Brain, except that it is rather firmer in its consistence. Strata of Orange-White Matter arise from all parts of this Central Mass, except the portion of it which appears at the bottom of the Peduncular Fossae, and which has been already described as continuous with the Peduncles. Im- mediately on leaving the Central Mass, they are lined on each surface, with a Coating of Brown Matter. They may be divided into three orders. Those of the third order, or the Ternary Strata, are the smallest, being no where thicker than a bristle. They a- rise, in general, from Primary or Secondary Strata, but sometimes directly from the Central Mass. They are dis- tinguished from the others, by having their edges, as well as their surfaces, covered with Brown Matter, and so form the Laminae which are seen on the Cerebellum externally. Strata of the second order, or Secondary Strata, are such as arise from Primary Strata, and branch off into Ternary ones. They vary in their size, but are always at least dou- ble the thickness of the Ternary Strata, and seldom, on the other hand, exceed the sixteenth part of an inch. L

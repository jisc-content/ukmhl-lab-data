LOWER SURFACE OF THE BRAIN PROPER. 87 oh the Anterior Lobe, is shut up by a little Eminence, shaped like a three-sided pyramid. Its base is turned up- wards and backwards, and its point in the opposite direction. One side of it looks downwards and a little backwards; the other two, are concealed in the Fossa between the Convolu- tions, into which the sharp anterior angle is inserted like a wedge. Its colour is brownish, like the Convolutions, but three streaks of a whiter colour are in general seen extending backwards from its lower surface. Of these the outermost, is the longest, which extends as far back as the most anterior part of the Fissure of Sylvius, on the surface of a small Convolution of the Anterior Lobe, and forms a gentle curve concave outwards. The middle one follows nearly the same direction, but is placed more towards the Median Line, and is considerably- shorter. The Internal streak, which is the shortest, but broader than the other two, bends gently backwards, upwards, and inwards, to- wards the posterior extremity of the Longitudinal Fissure. The number of these streaks does not always correspond on the opposite sides of the same Brain ; and they differ a good deal in number, and size, and direction, in different persons. In some there are but two, in others only one, and sometimes several lesser streaks are seen running into the larger ones. To the point of this Pyramidal Eminence just described, the Olfactory Nerve is attached. Immediately behind this Eminence, there is an oblong flat surface, extending outwards and backwards, from the Lon- gitudinal Fissure to the Fissure of Sylvius, and bounded by the Fractus Opticus on the inside. It is about three quar- ters of an inch long, and a quarter of an inch broad. There are a number of small holes in it; some of which towards the Fissure of Sylvius are large enough to admit a common pin. Its colour is greyish white. When the parts are in their

THE NERVES IN GENERAL. 198 times they are all nearly of one size in the same Nerve, sometimes of different sizes. When a Nerve consists of more than one Fasciculus, all the Fasciculi communicate as freely with each other, as the Filaments of a single Fasciculus do. It is impossible to display the Filaments of Nervous Mat- ter in a satisfactory manner by dissection. This can only be done, by the artifice so happily employed by Reil, for unfolding the structure of Nerves ; which is, macerating the Nerve for a short time in Muriatic Acid. The Acid dis- solves the Neurilema, and at same time hardens considera- bly the Filaments of Nervous Matter. The Filaments then admit of being separated gently from each other, and their form, and size, and connexions, are readily examined. When this operation is carefully performed, the Filaments always present themselves of the same size in the same Nerve. Whether these Filaments, however, may not be separable, by other means, into Filaments still smaller, we cannot pre- tend to say. Some of the Primary Nerves, such as the Olfactory Nerves, close to their Origin, do not exhibit the Filamentous struc- ture, but consist of a thick, undivided, Chord of Nervous Matter. The Neurilema or substance which surrounds each Fi- lament, ties the Filaments into Fasciculi, unites several Fasciculi together, and finally forms a general sheath for the whole Nerve, is, in most instances, so like Cellular Sub- stance, that we may regard it as a species of that Texture. It is denser where it immediately embraces a Fasciculus, and of a looser texture between the Fasciculi. In some Nerves, a small quantity of Adipose Substance is distinctly intermingled with it. Reil found, that by macerating a por- tion of a Nerve in a diluted Alkali, the Nervous Matter was dissolved, while the Neurilema remained entire ; so that the latter, after this operation, might be injected with Quick-

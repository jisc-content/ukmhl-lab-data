228 MUSCLE IN GENERAL. Fasciculi, which in all sorts of Muscle, appear to be pretty nearly of the same form and thickness. I propose to call these, therefore, the Primary Fasciculi*. In a transverse section, these Fasciculi always appear polyedrous ; triangu- lar, or quadrangular, or pentagonal ; but never circular. As to their thickness, I observe, that, in the representation which Prochaska has given of their appearance, as seen through a microscope magnifying the diameter two hundred times, the largest of them does not exceed an eighth of an inch, and the smallest is not below a sixteenth. In point of length, they are various ; but Prochaska affirms, that he has traced them extending, unbroken, and unconnected with any other Fasciculi, from one end to the other of the longest piece of Muscle in the Body, (viz. the Sartorius Muscle) which is fully two feet in length. In the third place, two or more of these Primary Fasci- culi, are generally found placed parallel and close to each other, so as to form larger or Secondary Fasciculi; these again, are often, though not always, united into Fasciculi still larger, which might be called Ternary ; and so on. Such are the more important of Pkochaskaâ€™s observa- tions respecting the Muscular Fibres. In one microsco- pical inspection, apparently of the Primary Fibres, made by the Wenzels -j-, each Fibre appeared to them to be com- posed of exceedingly minute, roundish, corpuscules. The piece of Muscle, however, had been previously steeped in a mixture of Muriatic Acid and Alcohol for eight days. The substance which unites the larger Fasciculi of Mus- cle together, corresponds, in every particular, with the Tex- ture already described under the name of Cellular Sub- stance. But the connecting medium between the lesser Fasciculi and between the Primary Fibres, is so delicate as * Prochaska has rather inaptly denominated these, Fibrcc Musculares. -f- De Penitior.

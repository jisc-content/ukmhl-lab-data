30 INNER SURFACE OF THE RIGHT AURICLE. this of the Right, another large Artery takes its origin, de- nominated the Aorta. The whole outside of the Heart is quite smooth. The colour of the Ventricles, at those parts where there is no Adipose Substance between the Serous and the Muscular Coat, is a brownish-pink, interspersed with whitish lines of different sizes, which are caused by the ramifications of Bloodvessels, and Absorbents, and Nerves. The Auricles are usually paler than the Ventricles. The Fatty parts ia both are always straw-coloured. When we lay open the Right Auricle to examine its ca- vity, we observe, in the first place, that its posterior surface is of a whitish colour. Towards the lower part of this sur- face, there is an elliptical, but very superficial depression, which slopes a little backwards, and is called the Oval Fossa. This Fossa is about half an inch long, and the third of an inch broad, with smooth edges, and having its long diameter turned upwards and downwards. Its size, however, varies very much in different individuals, and frequently it is en- tirely wanting. From what has been affirmed by several Continental Anatomists, on whose accuracy I am inclined to place con- siderable reliance, I am disposed to believe, that, in most instances, there is a small slit, sufficient to admit the point of a probe, immediately behind the upper margin of the Oval Fossa, leading upwards and a little to the left, into the Ca- vity of the Left Auricle. At same time, this is contrary to my own experience hitherto. On the fore part, the Auricle exhibits a sort of net-work of smooth, pinkish-coloured, cords, which run chiefly in a direction from right to left. On the upper surface of the Auricle, is seen, the orifice of the Superior Cava, having an inclination downwards, and a little forwards; and to the left of this, we find a ca- vity, extending into the Tip of the Auricle, the whole sur-

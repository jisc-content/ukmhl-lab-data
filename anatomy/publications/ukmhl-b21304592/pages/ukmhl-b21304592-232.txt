200 THE NERVES IN GENERAL. Nervous Fasciculus, as soon as it enters a Ganglion, di- vides into smaller Fasciculi, and these into Fasciculi still smaller, and all of these spread out, and intersect each other, in every direction. Then the Fasciculi begin to unite again with each other, or with the branches of some other Fasci- culus, which has subdivided within the Ganglion in a simi- lar manner; and forming, by their union in this way, bun- dles successively larger and larger, they at last emerge from the Ganglion, either all in one and the same Fasciculus, or in different Fasciculi. The intermixture of Fasciculi which thus takes place within a Ganglion, is, in general, so inti- mate, that it looks, as if every Fasciculus of every Nerve which emerges from the Ganglion, contained more or fewer Filaments, from every Fasciculus of every Nerve which en- tered it. Even if the Filaments of any Fasciculus, happen to be combined into the same Fasciculus again on emerging, there is every reason to believe that their relative position has been completely changed. There is no appearance of any Fasciculus or Filament terminating in a Ganglion, or arising in it; all seem to pass through. Each Fasciculus, in its progress through the Ganglion, seems to be provided with its proper Neurilema. But be- sides this, the spaces left between the intersections of the Fasciculi, are filled up with a peculiar, 6oft substance, of a greyish, sometimes a yellowish, colour. This substance has been very confidently pronounced, by some Anatomists, to be of the same nature with the Brown Nervous Matter of the Brain and Spinal Cord. There does not seem to me, however, to be the slightest resemblance between them. Scarpa * is inclined to regard it, as a soft cellular substance, filled with a greyish, and mucilaginous matter, in emaciated subjects, and with a yellowish, oily, matter, in those that &re fat.

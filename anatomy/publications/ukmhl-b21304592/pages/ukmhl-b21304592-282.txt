CARTILAGE IN GENERAL. 250 CHAPTER VI. THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF CARTILAGE. Cartilage is the substance commonly known by the name of Gristle. It is distinguished from all the other Tex- tures of the Body, by its firmness, great elasticity, and pear- ly appearance. The forms in which it occurs are very various; some- times it is found in layers or crusts, at other times in mass- es, more or less cylindrical. Thick slices of it are exactly like Opal; thin slices are transparent and almost colourless. On careful examination with the microscope, it appears to me, to be a uniform, homogeneous, substance, like Jelly, without either fibres, or laminae, or cells. There is no doubt of its being Vascular; but I do not know of any method by which its Bloodvessels can be in- jected after Death. These Vessels, therefore, must be ex- ceedingly minute. I speak here only of pure Cartilage in the Adult; for in those pieces of Cartilage which form the Epiphyses of Bones before Maturity, Arterial Vessels, as large as a bristle, may often be seen, running towards some particular point, where Osseous Substance is beginning to form. Neither Absorbents nor Nerves have ever been traced in- to this Texture. When thin slices of it are dried, they become quite tran- sparent, and of a yellowish colour, and are almost as brittle as glass. Plunged into Boiling Water, it immediately shrinks up, and becomes yellower and more opaque than before.

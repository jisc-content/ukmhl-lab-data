47 CARDIAC ARTERIES AND VEINS. *urtace of the Heart. It runs along this furrow in compa- ny with the Anterior Coronary Artery; receives branches on each side during its course; and then opens into the left side of the Main Branch close to the Right Auricle. The Anterior Branch begins towards the origin of the Anterior Coronary Artery, and runs along the groove be- tween the Right Auricle and Ventricle with this Vessel. It receives branches on each side as it goes on, and then terminates in the Main Branch, immediately anterior to die Middle one; very often in the Middle Branch itself. The Coronary Vein thus formed scarcely runs an eighth of an inch before it opens into the Right Auricle. At its termination it is about a third of an inch in diameter. Very often the Anterior Branch, instead of commencing so far up as has been described, is much smaller, and be- gins in the groove between the Auricle and Ventricle, op- posite the acute margin of the Heart. In this case, all the Venous branches coming from the Auricle and Ventri- cle above this point unite together into a distinct trunk, which running down along the Upper part of the groove just mentioned, opens directly into the Right Auricle, about the middle of its left Anterior margin. The orifice of this vessel within the Auricle is concealed by a part of the net-work of Fleshy Cords. I have, also, occasionally seen another distinct Corona- ry Vein opening into the Right Auricle, immediately behind and above the Orifice of the principal Vein of this name. This vessel began before the Tip of the Left Auricle; run down behind the Artificial Orifice of the Left Ventricle to the Septum between the Auricles; and then passed ob- liquely through this Septum, towards its left margin, and opened at the point described, about the size of a crow- quill. All the branches of the Coronary Veins which are larger than a pin, like the ramifications of the corresponding Ar-

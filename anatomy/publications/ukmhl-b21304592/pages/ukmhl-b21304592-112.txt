so THE BRAIN PROPER; The Brain is usually divided into two parts; an upper portion, denominated the Brain Proper, and a lower which is considerably smaller, called the Cerebellum. Suppose a plane to pass through the Cerebrum, bounded by the upper margin of the Annular Protuberance before, and by the lower edge of the Inferior Corpora Quadrigcmina behind; all above this plane may be considered Brain Pro- per, and all below it, Cerebellum. The Brain Proper weighs in general from 35 to 45 oz. Avoirdupois. Its greatest length is from GJ to 64- inches; its greatest breadth, from 5? to 5| inches; and its greatest depth, from 2} to 3 inches. Its form varies in almost every subject; but the varieties are extremely slight. An imaginary straight line or parallel plane, dividing the Body into two halves, right and left, has been denominated by some modern Anatomists, the Median Line or Median Plane. We may apply the same term to any similar line or plane, which separates any particular organ of the Body in- to two portions, neai'ly or exactly alike; and for the sake of brevity, we shall call all those parts of the Body which are capable of being divided in this manner, symmetrical parts. Now according to this acceptation of the term, the Brain Proper is symmetrical, and its Median Plane corresponds exactly to the Median Plane of the Body. Its two halves, right and left, are denominated Hemi- spheres. These are separated from each other to a considerable depth all round, except towards the middle of the lower surface, by a Longitudinal Fissure, running exactly in the direction of the Median Line. This Fissure is from It to 1J: inch deep, above and before; from 24 to 2$ itiche9, behind; and towards the forepart of the lower surface, about Â«n inch.

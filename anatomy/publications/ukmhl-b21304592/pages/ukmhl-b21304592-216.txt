184 SUBSTANCE OF THE SPINAL CORD. The Top of the Cord contains, on each side, between the Median Plane, and the Oblong and Oval Eminences, a sub- stance exactly similar to the Corpus Dentatum in the Cere- bellum, and to which the same name may be applied *. It is oval-shaped and flattened. Its long diameter lies up- wards and downwards; and its flattened surfaces are turn- ed, one forwards and inwards, the other backwards and out- wards. It is about five eighths of an inch long, a quarter of an inch broad, and a sixth of an inch in thickness. Its outer half occupies the whole length of the Oval Eminence; and its capsule is separated from the surface of this Emi- nence only by a Stratum of Orange-White Matter about a twentieth of an inch thick. Its inner border reaches to within a fifteenth part of an inch of the Median Plane. Its capsule consists of the same Brown Matter as that of the Corpus Dentatutn in the Cerebellum; but its indentations are finer. This capsule is generally quite complete along the outer half of the body ; but towards the inner border I have always found several small deficiencies in it. The nu- cleus consists of pure Orange-White Matter; through which numerous Bloodvessels, chiefly Venous, and larger than Commonly occur in the White Matter, are distributed. This greater vascularity will account for its having been often mis- taken for Brown Matter, as well as the nucleus of the Cor- pus Dentatum of the Cerebellum. The Oblong Eminences consist entirely of Orange-White Matter in general. Sometimes, however, I have seen a small portion of Greyish-Brown Matter, occupying their surface, close to their junction with the Annular Protube- rance. The outer half of the Peduncles of the Cord is composed pf Orange-White Matter, with the exception of the Brown * Vica d’Azyr calls it “ Le Corps Festonne, Dentele, ou Rhoinboidal des Eminences Olivaires.” Traite d’Anatomie, p. 93.

3 INTRODUCTION. Living Bodies, as every one knows, are divided into two great classes, Animals and Vegetables. Those Living Bodies are denominated Animals, which ap- pear to be capable of Sensation and Ideas, or of Feeling and Thought; and those, Vegetables, which do not seem suscep- tible of these phenomena. Sensation and Ideas are states which require no explana- tion. It is to be remembered, however, that, as they are phenomena which no man can perceive, or be conscious of, but in himself, their occurrence in other Living Bodies, must always be to us, matter of inference only, not of actual knowledge. It is on this account, that an Animal is defined to be, a Living Body which seems to be susceptible of Feeling and Thought. It is the business of Physiology to shew, that the only foundation of this inference with respect to any particular Living Body, is, a certain resemblance in the tnotions which it exhibits, to motions, which we know to be dependent upon Sensation and Ideas in ourselves. I propose to denominate the science which treats of Living Bodies, Vital Economy. This science will divide itself into two parts, Animal Economy, and Vegetable Economy; and each part will comprehend two distinct objects of investigation. Anatomy and Physiology. Anatomy occupies itself, solely, with the Structure of Living Bodies ; and the province of Physiology, is now universally restricted, to the investigation of their Functions. It is usual to consider the Structure and the Functions \ of the Human Body, apart from those of the Lower Ani- 2

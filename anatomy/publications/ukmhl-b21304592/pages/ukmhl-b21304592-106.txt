14 ABSORBENT GLANDS IN GENERAL. tions on the Thoracic Duct of the Horse is doubtful, and their application, at all events, to the Human Absorbent System, is not conformable with observation. The External Coat ascribed to Absorbents by Mascagni, is obviously a mixture of common Cellular and Adipose Substance. It is not easy, to discover from Cruikshankâ€™s* descrip- tion, whether he regards the Absorbents as consisting of one Coat or of two. No peculiarities have yet been observed in the Absorbent Vessels of the Adult Female; nor in those of either Sex, before or after Maturity. SECTION II. THE ANATOMY OF THE ABSORBENT GLANDS IN GENERAL. Cruikshank+ affirms, that he has injected the Thoracic Duct, from Absorbent Vessels on the back, without inject- ing any Absorbent Gland. But Mascagni is far better au- thority on a point of this sort; and from his numerous in- vestigations!, I have no doubt whatever, that there is no Absorbent Vessel in the Body, which does not pass through one Absorbent Gland at least, before it joins the Absorbent Trunks. Many Absorbent Vessels, it is well kuown, pass through several Glands in their progress. The Absorbent Glands are of various shapes and sizes. Some are oval, others globular, and others flat. Some are about an inch in diameter, and others scarcely a quarter of * Anatomy of the Absorbing Vessels, p. 60. f Anatomy of the Absorbing Vessels, p. 79. t. Vasor. Lymphat, Histor. p. 25.

IS STATURE OF THE FOETUS. About the middle of the fourth month, an Embryo re- presented by the same, is 5 inches; and one at the end of this month, is S inches. A Foetus represented by the same, and said to be of the fifth month, is 10 inches in length. According to Mr. Burks*, however, the Foetus is only about 6 or 7 inches in the fifth month; in the sixth, about 8 or 9 inches ; in the seventh about a foot; and in the eighth about 15 inches. At the Full Time, that is, at the end of nine months, or the natural period of Birth, the Foetus measures on an average, according to the observations of Roederer-]-, about 201 inches. This, at least, was the mean length of six- teen Male, and eight Female, children, born at the regular period; the longest measuring 214, and the shortest, 181 Inches. Dr. Clarke| measured the Heads of sixty Male, and sixty Female, children, born at the Full Time; and he found that the circumference, passing through the Occipi- tal Protuberance and the middle of the Brow, was, on an average, 13.8 inches ; while the arch from Ear to Ear over the Crown, was 7.32 Inches. One Head measured 15 inches in circumference, and one 81 inches from Ear to Ear ; but none were under 12 inches in circumference, or CJ across. The longest diameter of the,jchild’s Head at Birth, is that from the Crown to the Chin ; and this seems in gene- ral to measure about 5 inches. The breadth of the Head, from one Parietal Protuberance to the other, is usually about 3i inches. According to Soemmerring||, the most rapid increase of the Foetus takes place during the first weeks after Con- * The Principles of Midwifery, p. 121. •{- Comment Soc. Reg. Scien.

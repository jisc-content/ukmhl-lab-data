VEIN'S IN GENERAL. Gti ticity than Arteries, in the transverse direction; but the grounds of this opinion are not satisfactory. It is owing to their inferior elasticity, that we always find the Veins in a collapsed state, after they have been emptied of their contents. This appearance of itself, almost, is suf- ficient to distinguish a Vein from an Artery in the Dead Body, provided the Vessel be not too minute. Whether the Veins be stronger or weaker than the Arte- ries, does not yet appear to be sufficiently established. The experiments of Wintuingham* indeed, so often appealed to in points of this sort, have generally been regarded as demonstrative of their being stronger; but it seems to me, that they do not warrant the conclusions that have been drawn from them. From a few experiments which I have myself made, I am rather inclined to suspect, that the Veins are considerably weaker than the Arteries. In all Veins that are not less than the twelfth of an inch in diameter, two Coats can be distinctly seen ; and in some, there is a third texture which intervenes, at particular parts, between these two. The Inner Coat of Veins is transparent, like the Inner Coat of Arteries. It is a little thicker, however, than this Coat, and greatly stronger; and it differs from it also, re- markably, in this, that with the forceps we can distinctly . separate it into slender, dense, fibres. I have never seen either Bloodvessels, Absorbents, or Nerves in it. The Valves are generally regarded as being formed of duplicatures of this Coat; and they certainly do resemble it more than any other substance. But they differ from it, in having a number of little white bands running through them in every direction; and as to their consisting of two layers, I suspect this is rather supposed, than demonstrat- f Experimental Inquiry, Sec.

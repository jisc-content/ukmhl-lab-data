32 INNER SURFACE OF THE RIGHT VENTRICLE. Vein. It is frequently notched at its margin, and full of holes. . Anterior to these parts, the lower surface of the Auricle begins to exhibit the same kind of lattice-work, which we found on the fore part. The surface of the Auricle to the right, is smooth and pale coloured. The left side of the Auricle presents a large circular hole, about an inch and three fourths in diameter, with a smooth, white, shining circumference, leading into the Cavity of the Right Ventricle. This is denominated the Auricular Ori- fice of the Ventricle. The cavity of the Right Ventricle resembles somewhat the hollow of a three-sided pyramid; the base and the point, corresponding to the basis and the apex of the Heart. The lower side of the cavity is flat, the posterior a little convex, and the anterior slightly concave. The Upper angle of the base gives origin to the Pulmonary Artery. The whole surface of this cavity, except towards the Upper Angle, presents an extremely intricate net-work of smooth, rounded, and flat, Fleshy Columns, of various sizes. Some of the Columns are attached by both extremities to the sides of the cavity, but quite free in the middle, so that a probe may be passed under them. These are found chief- ly towards the Apex of the Ventricle; where many of them may be seen crossing, in every direction, from one side of the cavity to the other. Others remain attached by one side, throughout their whole length, to the surface of the Ventricle, and have the appearance of ridges. These in- tersect each other in various directions, and leave hollows between them, in the bottom of which are seen smaller ridges, crossing each other, in a similar manner. Other co- lumns, again, have one extremity attached to the surface of the Ventricle, while the other projects, in a pointed form, into its cavity, and gives origin to certain Tendin-

VALVES—ELASTICITY—-STRENGTH—GOATS. 73 f History of the Absorbent System, p. 26. trunks are more crowded with Valves than the branches, and sometimes I have seen the reverse of this.” The Absorbent Vessels which have the thickest sides, are the two Trunks of the System ; and yet I have never seen these exceed a sixtieth part of an inch. The other Vessels seem to be thinner, in proportion as they are smaller. That Absorbent Vessels possess considerable elasticity, is shewn by the experiment of puncturing them after they have been moderately distended with Mercury ; great part of the Mercury is immediately forced out. Judging, how- ever, from the Thoracic Duct, I should think that they are a good deal less elastic than Veins. All Anatomists are agreed, in pronouncing the Absor- bents to be much stronger, in proportion to their size, than Veins. This is proved by the much greater weight of Mer- cury which they will bear, before they are ruptured. In the sides of the Thoracic Duct, I cannot perceive dis- tinctly more than one Coat. This resembles the Inner Coat of Veins; and the Valves appear to be merely pro- longations of it. From the observations of Mascagni*, however, it would seem that the Valves sometimes contain a small quantity of a fine Adipose Substance. The other Absorbent Vessels are almost all too small to admit of being easily dissected ; but I conclude that they have a similar structure. Sheldon+ having found what he conceived to be three distinct Coats in the Thoracic Duct of a Horse,—an Inner one like the Inner Coat of Veins, an Outer like the Pleura or Peritonaeum, and a Middle one consisting of Muscular fibres running chiefly in a circular direction,—concluded without hesitation that the same tunics existed in the Absorbent Vessels in Man. The accuracy, however, of his observa- * Vasor. Lymph. Histor. p. 27 & 66.

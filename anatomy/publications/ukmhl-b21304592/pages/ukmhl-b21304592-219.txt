ITS PIA MATES. 187 nrinated the Fourth Ventricle, or Ventricle of the Cerebellum. As it is obviously not formed, however, by the Cerebellum alone, but partly by the Spinal Cord, a better name for it, perhaps, would be, the Spino-Cerebellar Ventricle. It com- municates with the Middle Ventricle of the Brain Proper through the Aqueduct of Sylvius. The Central Mass, there- fore, of the Nervous System, contains four cavities called Ventricles, the Middle, and two Lateral Ventricles of the Brain Proper, and the Spino-Cerebellar Ventricle ; all com- municating with each other, but having no external open- ing. The parts forming'the Spinal Fossa, in which the Top of the Cord is placed, are covered with their proper Pia Mater also; and this is loosely attached to the Pia Mater of the Cord, by means of delicate Bloodvessels. The Pia Mater of the other parts of the Cord, exhibits nothing peculiar. Where it terminates, however, at the pointed extremity of the Dorsal Portion, a slender, round cord sets off from it, which is continued straight downwards, amidst the roots of various Nerves afterwards to be describ- ed, to the very extremity of the Spinal Canal, where it is inserted into the Dura Mater. Its length is consequently about nine inches; and its thickness is usually about the fifteenth part of an inch, except just at its commencement above, where it is a little thicker. It is of a whitish colour, pretty strong, and capable of being separated into fine lon- gitudinal threads : but what proportion of these apparent filaments may be Bloodvessels, I do not know. The Arteries of the Pia Mater of the Cord are derived from the Vertebral, Inferior Thyroid, Intercostal and Lumbar Arteries. Those derived from the Vertebral Arteries, of which there are two, one Right and the other Left, may be divided into two sets.

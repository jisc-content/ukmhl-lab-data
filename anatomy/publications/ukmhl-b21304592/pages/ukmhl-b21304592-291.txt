259 SEROUS MEMBRANE IN GENERAL. contrary, it is of a Yellower colour, much less shining, hard- er, tougher, less Vascular and soluble with much more dif- 7 O 7 ficulty in Boiling Water, than at Maturity. CHAPTER IX. THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF SEROUS MEMBRANE. Serous Membrane is a substance scarcely so thick as a wafer, having one surface perfectly smooth and free, turned towards certain cavities of the Body, and another more or less flocculent, connected by fine Cellular Substance, to the sides of these cavities, or to the surfaces of their contents. It is quite soft and flexible, yet possesses considerable strength; and except when its Bloodvessels are filled with Blood or with coloured Injection, it is almost perfectly tran- sparent. A successful injection of Size or Turpentine, coloured with Vermilion, brings into view, in general, such an amaz- ing number of fine Bloodvessels in this Membrane, that one would be almost inclined to suppose that it was entirely composed of Arteries and Veins. By proper management, however, Absorbents may be injected in it, even with Quick- silver, to an equal degree of minuteness. There can be no doubt, therefore, that it is chiefly composed of these two systems of Vessels. Whether it contain any thing else but Vessels, remains to be ascertained. Nerves have not yet been traced into it; although they may be seen, everywhere, ramifying on the parts with which its external surface is connected. When dried, it becomes transparent, firm, and elastic. By Maceration in Cold Water, it is rendered opaque, be- comes gradually softer, and is at last reduced to a pulp. 2

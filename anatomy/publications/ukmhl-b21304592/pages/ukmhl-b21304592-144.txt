SUBSTANCE OF THE BRAIN. 112 Cerebrale. The lower surface of the Cerebellum presents, In the first place, on the Median Line, and on the forepart, an eminence denominated the Annular Protuberance*. This eminence is convex both from above downwards, and from side to side. It is quite symmetrical, and its Median Line corres- ponds to the Median Line of the Cerebellum. Its upper border slopes downwards a little on each side, and its lower is nearly horizontal; but in the middle of each margin there is a slight notch. The notch of the upper one is con- tinuous with the lower surface of the cul-de-sac, which termi- nates the Triangular Furrow between the Peduncles of the Brain Proper; and that of the lower, is continuous with the roof of a similar cul-de-sac at the top of the Spinal Cord. Between these two notches there runs a groove, similar to the impression of a goose-quill, which is denominated the Basilar Furrow. Along its upper margin, the Annular Protuberance is connected with the Peduncles of the Brain Proper; and here its transverse diameter measures from an inch to an % inch and an eighth. By its lower border, it is joined to the Spinal Cord ; but its transverse diameter at this part is only about three quarters of an inch. It is connect- ed laterally to the Peduncles of the Cerebellum; and as there is no distinct natural boundary between it and these prolongations, on the anterior part, I shall consider them as separated from each other, by an imaginary straight line, drawn from the forepart of the attachment of the Trigeminal Nerve, to the forepart of the attachment of the Facial Nerve of the same side. Along this line, the Protuberance measures about three quarters of an inch ; but towards its middle, close to the Basilar Furrow, its height is fully an inch. â€¢ Synonyms. Lat.

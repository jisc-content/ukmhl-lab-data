SMNAL CORD IN THE FEMALE. 191 from it, to the distance of a quarter of inch, with the utmost ease. A few, long and slender, whitish, filaments, only, unite them together. The Posterior surface of the Top of the Cord, is without any Arachnoid Membrane ; being closely applied to the anterior surface of the Spinal Lobules. From the anterior surface of the Top of the Cord, and from the lower surface of the Posterior Lobes of the Cere- bellum, the Arachnoid Membrane is continued down to the Cervical Portion of the Cord ; from this to the Dorsal Por- tion ; and from this, instead of tapering to a point like the Pia Mater, it is prolonged, in the form of a wide sheath, in- closing a large bundle of Nerves afterwards to be described, to the very extremity of the Spinal Canal. Throughout the whole of this course, its attachment to the Pia Mater underneath, is as loose as it has already been described to be, at the upper part of the Cord. It may not only be pinched up with the Forceps or the Fingers, with great fa- cility, but it may be inflated by a blow-pipe, from one end of the Cord to the other. We may regard it as perforated not only by the Vertebral Arteries above, but by all the Spinal Nerves, and all the Teeth of the Serrated Membrane on each side. At same time it is to be observed, that at each of these points, it is firmly tacked to the inner surface of the Dura Mater of the Spinal Canal. f â€˜ , I am not acquainted with any material circumstances in which the Spinal Cord of the Female differs from that of the Male. Chaussier* says he thinks the substance of the Cord in the Female is softer; but I doubt the accuracy of this. Very little is known respecting the state of the Spinal Cord before Maturity, or in the Decline of Life. * Exposit, Somm. p. 117.

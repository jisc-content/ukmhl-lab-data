ORIGINS OF THE Sl’INAL NERVES. 217 Of the Lumbar Nerves in Particular.—The Lumbar Nerves arise from the upper half of the lowest fourth of the Dor- sal Portion of the Cord. The Origins of both their Roots approach nearer and nearer to the Median Fissures, from the First to the Fifth. The Anterior Root of the First Lumbar Nerve, arises about -a tenth of an inch from the Anterior Median Fissure ; that of the Fifth about a twelfth. The Posterior Root of the First Lumbar Nerve takes its Origin within an eighth of an inch of the Posterior Median Fissure; that of the Fifth within a tenth. The Anterior Roots, consist, at their immediate Origin, of three or four small Fasciculi; but these, before they have run half an inch, unite into one Fasciculus, of which the Root is composed, until it perforates the Arachnoid Membrane. The Posterior Roots of all the Lumbar Nerves, except the Fifth, consist of two Fasciculi, when they perforate the Arachnoid Membrane; the Fifth in general consists of three. Each of these Fasciculi is formed by the union of several smaller ones, which may be easily traced, quite dis- tinct from each other, until the Root is just about to pass through the Arachnoid Membrane. Each of the Fasciculi of the Posterior Roots is as large as the single Fasciculus of the Anterior Roots; except in the Fifth Lumbar Nerve, where they are always smaller. The Fasciculi composing the Roots of the First Lumbar Nerve are larger than those of the Last Dorsal; and those of Second, Third, and Fourth Dorsal, are a little larger in succession. The Fasciculi of the Posterior Roots, however, of the Fifth Lumbar, are smaller than any of the Fourth ; while the Fasciculus forming its Anterior Root, is the larg- est of all the Lumbar Fasciculi. The Anterior Roots arise about a sixteenth of an inch from each other; the Posterior Roots about an eighth.

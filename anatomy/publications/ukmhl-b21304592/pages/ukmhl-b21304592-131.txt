CENTRAL FISSURE OF THE BRAIN PROPER. 99 lami, which are here of a greyish colour, and closely applied to each other. On the forepart, and a little below these surfaces, two white, rounded, smooth, ridges, are seen, one on each side, running upwards, forwards, and a very little inwards, for about a quarter of an inch, and then uniting with each other on the Median Line. These are called the Anterior Pillars of the Fornix *. The bottom of the Vertical Prolongation slopes, from be- hind, downwards and forwards. At its posterior extremity, it communicates, under the Posterior Commissure, with a Ca- nal about a twelfth of an inch in diameter, and half an inch in length, called the Aqueduct of Sylvius. This canal runs backwards and downwards on the Median Line, under and before the lamina which connects the Corpora Bigemina on each side to each other, and which has the Longitudinal Furrow on its upper and posterior surface; and opposite to the inferior extremity of this Furrow, or to the Frenulum, it opens into the Central Fissure of the Cerebellum. The bottom of the Vertical Prolongation projects at its anterior extremity into a cul-de-sac, of which the lower por- tion is of a conical shape, and penetrates half way to the point of the Infundibulum ; while the upper, of a triangular figure, has its apex turned downwards and forwards; and has for its anterior side, a thin lamina, the outer, grey, sur- face of which has been already described, above the Commis- sure of the Tractus Optici; and for its posterior, the superior surface of this Commissure itself. I do not find, that this latter portion of the Vertical Prolongation, has been taken notice of, by any author. It measures, at its base, about an eighth of an inch from before backwards, and nearly a sixth of an inch from side to side; and the length of its anterior sur- face, in the middle, is fully a quarter of an inch. * Synowyms.

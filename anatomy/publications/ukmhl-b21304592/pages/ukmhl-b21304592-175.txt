NERVOUS MATTER OF PARTICULAR TARTS. 143 The Pillars of the Vieusscnian Valve, which are also con- tinuous with the Annular Protuberance, are formed entire- ly of Orange-White Matter, except a thin coating of Red- dish-White on the surface next the Central Fissure. The upper part of the Vieussenian Valve, consists of a plate of Orange-White Matter, lined next the Fissure with a very thin covering of Reddish-White. This covering is conti- nued down over the inner surface of the lower portion of the Valve, the outer surface of this portion being formed of a layer of Greyish-Brown Matter, divided into bands as formerly described. In the angle between the antei'ior and posterior sides of the Central Fissure of the Cerebellum, close to its apex, there is a small portion of the same dark-coloured matter apparently, which is found on the inside of the Peduncles of the Brain Proper. It lies parallel to the edge of the Fis- sure, and is usually from an eighth to a quarter of an inch long, and about a twentieth of an inch thick. A very thin stratum only of Reddish-White Matter separates it from the Fissure internally, and accordingly it is generally seen shin- ing through that stratum. This substance does not seem hitherto to have been taken notice of. The Peduncles of the Cerebellum consist of Orange- White Matter; and the Alae of the Inferior Vermiform Process are composed entirely of the same substance. The whole remaining parts of the Cerebellum may be regarded as forming a Central mass from which all the La- minae derive their White Matter. When the whole of these Laminae are removed, this Central mass remains, somewhat of the form of the whole Cerebellum. It is symmetrical, its Median Plane corresponding to that of the Cerebellum, and it consists of two Lateral Parts, one on each side, and a Middle Part joining these together. Each of the Lateral Parts measures from before back- wards nearly an inch and a quarter, and is about the same

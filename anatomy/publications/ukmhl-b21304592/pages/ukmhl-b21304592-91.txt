ARE COMPOSED OF THREE COATS. 5ยง matter โข and placed uniformly in a circular direction, sur- rounding the Artery, and in a plane perpendicular to its axis. Those which are more internally situated, may be easily seen through the transparent Inner Coat of the Artery, by slitting open the Vessel. If this Coat be peeled off, the fibres of the Middle one may then be easily raised by the forceps in successive strips, all of which separate in a trans- verse or circular direction, exactly like the outer bark of a birch-tree. In the large Arterial trunks the fibres are firmer in their consistence, and of a yellowish or straw colour ; but as the Vessels diminish to a middling size, they become gradually softer and more flesh-coloured, and then resemble very much the Muscular Fibres of the Heart. The Middle Coat of an Artery is abundantly supplied with small Bloodvessels. They are often seen turgid with Blood after Death ; and they easily admit of being injected with coloured Size or Turpentine. I cannot say that I have ever seen either Absorbents or Nerves in this Coat. No connecting medium can be perceived between the Middle Coat of an Artery and the Inner one. They are merely laid over each other, as the Inner Membrane of the Ventricle is laid over the Muscular Coat of the Heart. The External Coat of Arteries differs extremely from the other two. It consists of slender white, shining fibres, like the fibres of cotton, very dense and tough, closely compact- ed together, and interwoven in every direction. It is best dissected by slipping the Artery over a glass rod, so as to make it quite tight, and then tearing off the fibres with a pair of forceps, from without inwards. It requires consider- able force to separate them; and no art will make them peel in any uniform direction. We judge that we have got through the whole of the Coat, when we come to a stratum of fibres of a yellowish or flesh-colour, soft and separating uniformly

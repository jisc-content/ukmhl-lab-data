NERVOUS MATTER OF PARTICULAR PARTS. 137 minae and threads into the substance of the Thalamus, where they gradually disappear. The inclination of these is chiefly from above downwards and inwards. They are all as fine as hairs, and are sepai-ated from each other and surrounded, by Greyish-Brown Matter. None of them seem to reach the opposite side of the Thalamus; but vanish be- fore they get even to the layer of Brown Matter already described on that side. In the lowest part of the Thalamus, and about its mid- dle, above and to the outside of the nodule described p. 133, there is a similar nodule of Brown Matter, only a little larger, the white capsule of which below, forms the inferior boundary of the Thalamus. In addition to all these parts in the Thalami Optici we have to remember that there is the White Cord described at p. 131, connected with the Mammillary Eminences. The Taenia Semicircularis, consists of a ridge of Orange- White Matter, connected with the white covering of the Thalamus Opticus, and, by its anterior extremity, with the Anterior Pillar of the Fornix. This white ridge, however, towards the forepart, is always covered by a layer a twelfth or a tenth of an inch thick, of a semitransparent Greyish- Brown Matter. , The whole superior surface of the Corpora Striata, seems to be covered with an extremely thin layer of Yellowish- White Matter, similar to that which lines the Median side of the Thalami Optici, and like it, a little tougher than the White Nervous Matter in other parts of the Brain. This coating is best seen in a section of the Corpus Striatum; for it is so fine, that the Brown Matter underneath obscures it very much when viewed from above. Both the Corpora Geniculata, are composed of White and Brown Matter. The Outer Corpus Geniculatum con- tains a nucleus of Wood-Brown Matter, surrounded by a covering about a thirtieth of an inch thick of Orange-White.

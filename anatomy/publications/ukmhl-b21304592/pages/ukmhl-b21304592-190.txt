MEMBHANES OF THE BRAIN. 15S scribed as having three Horns; the Anterior Prolongation of the Middle Part of the Fissure forms the Anterior Horn; the Posterior Lateiâ€™al Part of the Fissure, the Posterior Horn* ; and the Anterior Lateral Part of the Fissure, the Inferior Horn. The Pia Mater embraces the Lamina of the Cerebellum, exactly in the same manner, as it does the Convolutions of the Brain Proper. It binds together the sides of the Semi- lunar Fossa, on the upper surface of the Cerebellum, and of the Peduncular Fossae on the lower surface ; and it unites the Inferior Vermiform Process to the Spinal Lobule and the Inferior Lobes, on each side. There is a small mass of a substance like the Choroid Plexus of the Brain Proper, only a little tenderer, which rests on the lower and anterior surface of the Sub-peduncular Lobules, without being at- tached to them, being connected with the parts more interi- orly situated; and there is a narrow fringe of the same kind of substance, affixed to the Head of the Inferior Ver- miform Process, and to the anterior margins of the Wings of this Process. The Pia Mater embracing the Annular Protuberance is denser and stronger than in any other part of the Brain ; and here, as well as over the lateral and infe- rior surface of the Spinal Lobules, it is but very loosely con- nected to the Arachnoid Membrane. There is no prolon- gation of the Pia Mater into the Central Fissure of the Ce- rebellum. All the Arteries which are ramified throughout the Pia Mater, and consequently all the Arterial Vessels which are distributed throughout the substance of the Brain, are de- rived from the Internal Carotid, the Basilar, and the Ver- tebral Arteries. The Internal Carotid Artery, in each Hemisphere of the Brain, sends off the following branches. 1. The Commu- * Synonyms. Fr. Ancyroide; Cavite Digitate.

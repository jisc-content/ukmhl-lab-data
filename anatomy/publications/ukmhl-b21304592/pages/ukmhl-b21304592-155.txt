123 WHITE NERVOUS MATTER. A fine injection of size and vermilion, brings a great many little Vessels into view, which were before invisible. Absorbent Vessels have not yet, so far as I know, been distinctly traced into this Matter. When a portion of White Nervous Matter is plunged for a few minutes into boiling oil, or steeped for a few days in Alcohol, Diluted Muriatic or Nitric Acids, Mixture* of Alcohol and Acids, or a solution of Corrosive Subli- mate, its consistence is greatly increased : and if we now endeavour to tear its parts asunder, we find that every por- tion of it, may, by laceration in one direction or another, be made to exhibit a fibrous appearance. From the fibrous surfaces thus exposed, slender white threads may be raised, with the point of a pin, almost as fine as a hair; and the whole seems to be formed of such delicate fibrils, placed closely together, without any con- necting medium. Different fasciculi of these fibrils, often intersect each other, or are interwoven ; but all the fibrils of a fasciculus are laid parallel or concentric to each other. The delicacy of the fibrils, and the closeness with which they are compacted together, render it impossible to ascer- tain their actual length, or even to form a conjecture as to the dimensions of the smallest one. Whether the White Nervous Matter in all parts of the Brain, be capable of exhibiting this fibrous appear- ance, does not yet seem to me satisfactorily established ; but in all those portions of the organ in which it has been ob- served, it has been found, that each portion has a particu- lar arrangement of fibres, which it preserves pretty uni- formly in all subjects. May we conclude from these observations, that the White Nervous Matter in such portions of the Brain, actual- ly consists of fibres in the living Body, which are too minute and too soft to maintain their form in sections and lacerations of this substance after death, unless they have

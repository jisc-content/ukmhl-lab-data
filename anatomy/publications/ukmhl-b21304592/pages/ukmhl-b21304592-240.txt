THE NERVES IN CENERAt. 208 From this, it runs upwards, forwards, and a little out* wards, closely applied to the Anterior surface of the Protu- berance, and covered by the larger branches of the Basilar Artery. After a course of about five eighths of an inch, it perforates the Arachnoid Membrane. It is flat at its Origin, and becomes rounder as it ascends; its breadth nowhere exceeding the fifteenth part of an inch. It is obviously composed of Filaments, or fine Fasciculi of Filaments, with a Neurilema of Pia Mater. At their Origin, these generally form two or three little bundles; be- tween which, very often, pretty large branches of the Basilar Artery may lie seen running. Origins of the Trigeminal Nerves. The Trigeminal Nerve arises, on each side} from two points which were described p. 116, 117, one on the upper, and another on the anterior surface, of the Peduncle of the Cerebellum. It projects, from its Origin, forwards and a little inwards, for about three quarters of an inch, and then perforates the Arachnoid Membrane. It is always of a flattened shape, but less so in some sub- jects than others. The flat surfaces look, the one upwards and outwards, the other in an opposite direction. Its great- est breadth varies from a sixth to a fifth of an inch. This portion of the Trigeminal Nerve is composed, through- out, of Fasciculi of Nervous Filaments, which are surround- ed, individually and generally, with a Neurilema of Pia Ma- of this Nerve. But in all of these, the little white Cords which seemed to run into the Nerve from the Pyramidal Eminences, remained attached also to the Annular Protuberance, until they reached the po.nt described in the text. It is on that account, in conformity with the signification in which I have hither- to employed the term Origin, that I still continue to consider this Nerve as arising from the Annular Protuberance.

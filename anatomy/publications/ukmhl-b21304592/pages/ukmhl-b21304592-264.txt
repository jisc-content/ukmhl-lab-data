SKIN IN GENERAL. 232 The Skin in certain parts, as around the Alas and Tip of the Nose, on the Chin and Cheeks, and in the Axillae and Groins, exhibits a number of greyish or yellowish coloured, circular, spots, from a hundredth, to a fortieth or fiftieth part of an inch in diameter. These are the mouths of little cylindrical cells called Sebaceous Follicles, which dip straight down into the Skin; and are generally filled with a seba- ceous matter, which becomes a little coloured on its surface, and so enables us to discover the position of the cysts con- taining it. My present belief is, that there are no distinct Pores vi- sible, either with the microscope or with the naked eye, on the outer surface of the Skin, in its natural state; but this is a point to be further investigated. I cannot perceive any appearance of them, at the points from which the Hairs spring; these little prolongations seem to fill up completely the canals by which they penetrate to the surface. The lit- tle depressions which have been described as Pores, on the tops of the llidges observable on the Skin covering the points of the Fingers and Toes, I shall have occasion to con- sider afterwards, when treating of the Integuments of the Extremities; but they do not appear to me deserving of the name of Pores. The appearance of the inner surface of the Skin, is very different from the outer. One cannot give an idea of it by words. I may observe, however, that except in a very few parts, it exhibits a number of depressions, placed close to each other, and varying in size from a twelfth to an eighth of an inch or more, which give an areolar appearance to the whole surface. Bichat *, who first took notice of these de- pressions, affirms, that besides the passages for the Hairs, there are little pores or canals in the bottom of each of them; which penetrate to the outer surface of the Skin, and serve.

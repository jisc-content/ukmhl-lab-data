35 THE TRICUSPID VALVE. distended, is kept closely applied to the sides of the Cavi- ty. It is only by compressing the Ventricle, in all direc- tions, that we can make the Flaps fold together so as to shut up the Auricular Orifice; and unless the Tendinous Cords be completely cut across, it is impossible to force them beyond this Orifice, towards the Auricle. When these Cords, however, are divided, and the Flaps of the Valve are then properly folded together, we shall find that they are of sufficient size to close the Auricular Orifice entirely, even when the Ventricle is distended to the utmost. The cavity of the Left Auricle is smooth on all sides and of a pale colour. At the two right and anterior angles are seen the ori- fices of the two Right Pulmonary Veins, and at the two right and posterior angles, the openings of the two Left Pulmonary Veins. At the left, upper and posterior angle, a cavity is obser- ved extending into the Tip of the Auricle, which when laid open, is found to correspond in shape to the Tip viewed externally. It exhibits on its surface a kind of net-work similar to that in the Tip of the Right Auricle, but sim- pler, and composed of whiter and more superficial ridges. The whole left side of the Left Auricle, is formed into an orifice, which leads to the Left Ventricle. This is de- nominated the Auricular Orifice of the Left Ventricle. It is circular in its shape, about half an inch less in dia- meter than the Right Auricular Orifice, and has a smooth margin, all round. The cavity of the Left Ventricle resembles an elliptical cone, the Base and Apex corresponding to the Base and Apex of the Heart, and the long diameter of the cross sec- tion running from before backwards. The whole surface of this cavity presents a net-work of Fleshy Columns, similar to that in the Right Ventricle, al- though there is a considerable difference between them in 2

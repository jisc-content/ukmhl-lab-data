INTllOIKJCTION. o tj and tlic introduction of this matter into the system of the Plant or Animal, and its subsequent conversion into wood or bone, &c., constitutes its appropriation. As long as this process goes on in the Plant or Animal, it is said to be Liv- ing or Alive, or to possess Life ; the instant it ceases, it is denominated Dead. Some Bodies, such as those commonly known by the name of Minerals, have always existed in the Dead state ; no ap- propriating process, for example, has ever been discovered in a piece of Marble or of Iron. In others, the process of Life is occasionally renewed, after a Temporary Death of minutes or of centuries. The object of this continual appropriation of foreign matter, by which Living Bodies are distinguished, appears to be, to maintain in these Bodies such a constitution, as shall enable their various parts, to exercise properly the functions which the Creator intended them to perform;—to preserve, for example, a certain degree of hardness, roughness, or opacity in one organ; and of softness, smoothness, or tran- sparency in another;—to enable one species of fibre to exer- cise Irritability; and to qualify another for being the ma- terial instrument, through which the immaterial and spiri- tual Mind may influence the Body, or the Body the immate- rial Mind. But it would be foreign to the purposes of this Introduction, to enlarge on these views at present. It is sufficient, simply to have pointed out the process, by which Living Bodies are essentially characterized. It belongs to Physiology to investigate the uses of this process, and the phenomena from which its existence may be inferred.

4:2 PARTS COMPOSING THE SIDES OP THE HEART side, and in the Tip, they are collected into Fasciculi which constitute those ridges or cords formerly described on the inner surface. In the furrows between the ridges, the Fasciculi are connected only by a very few fibres, so that here, in many points, the Serous and the Inner Membrane are in contact with each other. In the right and upper sides of the Left Auricle, the fibres seem to run chiefly from before backwards; and in the Tip they are fasciculated. In the lower side, they incline principally from right to left; and in the posterior, mostly from above downwards. In the Septum of the Auricles, the fibres are very irre- gularly disposed around the margin of the Oval Fossa; and in the Fossa itself, there are in general a few Muscular threads, formed into an irregular net-work. Some Anatomists have described the Muscular Fibres of t'he Ventricles with a most tedious and unprofitable minute- ness*. It is sufficient to observe, that these fibres seem to be formed into three strata, which pass insensibly into each other. The outer stratum, which is covered by the Adipose sub- stance and the Serous Membrane, consists of fibres, which, at different parts of the Ventricles, are seen running for a considerable extent of surface, parallel to each other. On the outer surface of the Right Ventricle, for example, the fibres run from the right and from below, obliquely upwards and to the left. The fibres on the outer surface of the Left Ventricle again, are seen running from above and from the right, obliquely downwards and to the left. Along the groove between the Ventricles above, the direction of the fibres belonging to each, corresponds pretty exactly; * Senac, Traite, &c. I. p. 12, 181. Wolf, Acta Acad. Scient. Imper. Petrop.

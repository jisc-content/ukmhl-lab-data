SKIN IN GENERAL. 238 « either do not exist, or where they are invisible, where, « however, the pores are very numerous, as on the Nose “ and some parts of the External Ear, no perforations can “ be traced in the separated Cuticle; though the sebaceous “ matter could formerly be pressed from the cavities of these “ pores on the Nose, in the form of a small worm, of some “ considerable length.'”—“ I perforated pieces of Cuticle “ with a fine needle, but these perforations were invisible “ in the microscope, as they would have been had I perfo- “ rated the elastic gum. The pores of filtrating paper, e< when dry, are very manifest in the microscope; but on wetting this paper, they become invisible*.” Their can be little doubt, that the Cuticle is entirely des- titute of Bloodvessels, Absorbents, and Nerves. Nothing resembling these, has ever been seen in this substance ; and it exhibits no phenomena, either healthy or diseased, in the Living Body, which would lead us to infer that it possesses them. It is the first substance, therefore, which we have had occasion to consider, which is truly inorganized or non- vascular. In separating it from the True Skin, in the manner for- merly recommended, particularly in a piece of Skin from the Soles of the Feet or Palms of the Hands, a number of very delicate, transparent, colourless filaments, may in ge- neral be seen, stretched out in the angle between it and the True Skin; which sometimes admit of being extended to the length of nearly an inch, before they give way. Dr. Hunter*!*, who has described and represented these fila- ments exceedingly well, regarded them as the Vessels of the Sweat, passing from the True Skin to the Cuticle. Twenty years before, (although Dr. Hunter does not seem to have been aware of this,) the same filaments had been taken notice * Experiments on the Insensible Perspiration, p. 12/ f Medic.

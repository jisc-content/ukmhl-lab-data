WEIGHT, FORM, AND DIMENSIONS, OF l'HK CEREBELLUM. 107 wards the forepart, than at the Apex. It is to this convex surface that the term Colliculus* has been applied. The opposite surface of the cavity is smooth, white, and concave ; but whether the two surfaces are in contact, in the healthy state of the Brain, or are separated to a slight dis- tance from each other, is not yet ascertained. As both the Anterior and the Posterior Lateral Parts of the Central Fissure, arise from the posterior corners of the Middle Part, all these Parts communicate at this point with each other; and the sort of area where they meet, immediately behind the Posterior Pillars of the Fornix, is about a quarter of an inch in diameter. Such are all the circumstances worthy of notice respecting the different portions of the Central Fissure of the Brain Proper. The division of this Fissure into compartments called Ventricles, will be considered afterwards, when we come to treat of the Membranes of the Cerebellum. We have now to examine, according to the same order, the circumstances relating to weight, dimensions, form, and colour, in the Cerebellum. The Cerebellum weighs in general from five to eight ounces Avoirdupois. It approaches to an elliptical shape, the long diameter lying horizontally, and at right angles to the Median Line of the Body. Its inferior surface is convex; its superior, pro- minent in the middle and towards the forepart, and slightly concave behind and at the sides. Its long diameter measures from three and three fourths to four inches; its transverse diameter, in the middle, about an inch less ; and its greatest height, or depth, or thickness, is from an inch and three fourths to two inches. Like the Brain Proper, it is symmetrical, its Median Line corresponding with the Median Line of the Body; and its two halves are denominated Hemispheres. • Synonyms. Lnt.

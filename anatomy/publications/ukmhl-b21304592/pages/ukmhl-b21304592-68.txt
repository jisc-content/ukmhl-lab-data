36 INNER SURFACE OF THE LEFT VENTRICLE. the shape, and size, and interweaving of the Columns It would not be easy to give an exact idea of this difference, in words; but the Columns arc, upon the whole, smaller and rounder ; they are no where seen stretching across the cavity from one side to the other, as in the Right Ventri- cle ; and the intersections of the more superficial Columns, correspond better with those of the Columns deeper seat- ed, so that although the net-work be not deeper than that in the Right Ventricle, we see farther into it. Two columns, however, considerably larger than any in the Right Ventricle, are seen arising, one from the mid- dle of the upper, and another from the middle of the lower surface, close to the posterior edge of the cavity. These, after running a short way towards the Auriclar Orifice, ter- minate in a projecting extremity which is usually divided into a number of papillae. They differ a good deal in shape in different individuals; and in some they are much deeper cleft towards the middle, than in others. The one arising from the upper side of the Ventricle is generally the larger; and this one also is, in most instances, divided at its project- ing extremity, into three parts. From these Flesliy Columns a set of Tendinous Cords arise, which go to be attached to the Mitral Valve. This Valve corresponds to the Tricuspid Valve in the Rio-ht Ventricle. It is connected to the circumference of O the Auricular Orifice, which occupies the posterior part of the base of the cavity; but instead of three, its floating edge is divided only into two Flaps, parabolic in their shape, and somewhat like the two segments of a mitre ; hence the name given to it of Mitral Valve. It is white, pliable, and strong like the Tricuspid Valve ; equally thin in some parts, but much thicker in others, parti- cularly towards its edge; and it is always folded towards the Ventricle. â€¢

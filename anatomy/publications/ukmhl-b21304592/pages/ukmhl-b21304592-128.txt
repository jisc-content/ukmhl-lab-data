96 SUBSTANCE OF THE BltAIW The Central Fissure may be regarded as consisting of five portions; a large Middle Part, occupying chiefly the middle regions of the Brain Proper; and four lesser La- teral Parts prolonged from the posterior corners of the Middle one, two from each. Of the Lateral Parts, one on each side, is continued forwards into the Middle Lobe, and may be called Anterior ; while the other extends backwards into the Posterior Lobe, and may be named Posterior. The Middle Part of the Central Fissure is precisely symmetrical, its Median Line corresponding with the Median Line of the Brain Proper. It communicates by its posterior margin with the external surface, under the whole extent of the posterior extremity of the Corpus Callosum. From this it extends forwards, forming a slight convexity upwards in the longitudinal direction, and a slight concavity in the transverse. On the Median Line, it sends down a pro- longation of a triangular form, which extends along the Median Plane, and has its apex turned downwards and for- wards, while its posterior angle is continued into a Canal which runs downwards and backwards, and opens into the Central Fissure of the Cerebellum. We shall call this the Vertical Prolongation of the Middle Part. Two other prolongations, which may be called Anterior, are continued from the Middle Part, forwards and downwards, one on each side of the Median Line. These form a convexity looking inwards, upwards, and forwards. The Middle Part of the Central Fissure measures about an inch and a half, from side to side; about an inch and a quarter on the Median Line; and along the outer margin, on each side, about two inches and a quarter. The depth of the Vertical Prolongation in the middle is about half an inch. We shall consider the width of the Middle Part at different points, after we have described the appearances which are to be seen on the surfaces which form its sides.

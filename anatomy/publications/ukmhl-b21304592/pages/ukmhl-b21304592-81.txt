HEART OF THE FEMALE AND FOETUS. 49 yellowish colour; but if there is much Fat between the Out- er and Muscular Coat, it is difficult to detect them at all. They ramify with the ramifications of the Arteries, and at last penetrate with them, between the Muscular Fibres of the Auricles and V entricles. The plexus which accompanies the Posterior Coronary Artery, and which is chiefly distributed on the Left Ven- tricle and Auricle, is always larger, and composed of thick- er Nervous Filaments than the anterior Plexus accompany- ing the Anterior Coronary Artery. The Nervous branches which unite to form these two Plexuses, from which all the Nerves that are perceptible in the Heart are derived, will be described afterwards. The Heart of the Female differs from that of the Male, only in being a little smaller. I have not yet had an opportunity of observing, so ful- ly as I could wish, the different peculiarities of the Heart before and after Maturity; and on consulting the nume- rous dissertations which have been written on this subject by other Anatomists, I find little on which I am disposed to rely. I shall therefore content myself at present with stating all that I have yet seen; hoping to be able to ren- der the description more complete at some future time. The only material difference which seems to exist in point of shape between the Heart of the Fcetus and the Adult, is what results from the greater proportional size of the Tips of the Auricles in the former. In a Foetus of three or four months, these are so large that they almost come into con- tact over the Anterior part of the root of the Pulmonary Artery. As the Fcetus grows older, however, they gra- dually diminish proportionally ; and after Birth, much dif- ference in this fespect from the Adult Heart is not percep- tible. VOL. I. E (ft f

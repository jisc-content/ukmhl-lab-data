252 BONE IV GENERAL. I need say nothing respecting its colour, hardness, or elasticity. The fabric of the Skeleton alone, of which every person has a general notion, is sufficient to show the great variety of forms under which it exists. In some parts, innumera- ble fibres and plates of it may be found, nearly as fine as a hair; in others, it occurs in solid pieces, fully half an inch thick. Its structure is exceedingly simple. Divide it, and exa- mine its surfaces, with a common magnifying glass, or cut off slender films of it, and inspect them in a powerful micros- cope, and it will appear to be a uniform substance, with- out fibres, plates, or cells, penetrated everywhere by deli- cate Bloodvessels. The Bloodvessels admit of being injected with Size or Turpentine and Vermilion, pretty freely; but from the opacity and hardness of the Texture in its natural state, it is impossible to trace them, with the eye or by dissection, into its more interior parts. There is a very simple method, however, by which a piece of Bone, after it has been mi- nutely injected, may be rendered almost perfectly transpa- rent ; and then its Bloodvessels are displayed in the most beautiful manner. For this purpose, it is only necessary to steep the piece of Bone in Diluted Muriatic Acid, for a few hours, or days, or weeks, according to the thickness of the specimen, until it has become quite soft and pliable. It is then to be well washed, and after it has been gradually but completely dried, it is to be plunged into Spirit of Tur- pentine. The instant it is immersed in this fluid, it be- comes transparent; but the substance injected into the Ar- teries retaining its colour and opacity, the most minute ra- mifications of these Vessels are distinctly seen. There can be no doubt that Bone is also possessed of Ab- sorbents and Nerves; but these have not yet been traced into it.

BONE IN GENERAL. 256 I have not been able to perceive any difference, between the Osseous Substance of the Female and that of the Male. In the Foetus and Infant, the colour of Bone is much redder than in the Adult. It becomes gradually paler as the individual approaches to Maturity. In the Decline of Life, it generally acquires a deeper tint of yellow. In point of consistence, it will be found to be softer and more elastic, the younger the subject; and harder and more brittle, the older. Its specific Gravity almost invariably increases with the Age of the individual. Its Vascularity is much greater in early Life than at Ma- turity, and much less in Old Age. To this, no doubt, in part, the difference in its colour is owing. With respect to Chemical Properties, it is sufficient to remark, that the quantity of Calcareous Matter contained in Bone, proportionally to the Albuminous Part, is always greater, the older the subject. This will account for the difference in its Specific Gravity, hardness, and strength at different periods of Life ; and in part, also, for the differ- ence in its colour. CHAPTER VIII. THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF TENDON*. Tendon or Tendinous Substance, is the Texture common- ly known by the name of Sinew. '* This is precisely the same Substance, as that described by Bichat (Anat. Gener. III. 145.) under the name of “ Sysleme Fibrcux.” I have not hesitated, however, to reject this appellation, because it is equally ap- plicable to Nerve, Muscle, or even Cellular Substance, as to Tendon.

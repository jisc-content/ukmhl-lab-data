5 INTRODUCTION. The inhabitants of Great Britain, and of Europe in general, are usually Full Grown or Adult, at the age of twenty-five or thirty years. This is the period of Life, therefore, which I wish to be understood as denoted by the term Adult Age, or Maturity. All the descriptions throughout the Work, are to be con- sidered as applicable to the Adult Male, unless when the con- trary is expressly specified. To regulate the interpretation of the terms Above, Below, Before, Behind, &c. I shall uniformly suppose the Body to be in the Erect Posture, with the Arms Hanging parallel to the Trunk, and the Palms of the Hands, and the Toes, turned directly forwards. This is a simple remedy, and the only effectual one, for the trifling ambiguity which might otherwise attend the use of these terms.

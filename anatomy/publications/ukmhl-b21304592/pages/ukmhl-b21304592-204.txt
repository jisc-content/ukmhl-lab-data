172 DIFFERENCES IN THE BRAIN this organ have acquired, at the seventli year, their full di- mensions, and suffer no alteration in this respect after- wards *. With regard to the weight of the Brain, they observe, that this is difficult to be ascertained in the Embryo prior to the fifth month, as the organ is so soft as not to be easily extracted entire. The following, however, is part of a Table -f-, in which they have exhibited the weight of the whole Brain, of the Brain Proper, and of the Cerebellum, and the ratio of the two last to each other, as it was ascertained in nineteen dif- ferent instances, at various periods, from the fifth month after Conception to the eighty-first year.

That the weight of the whole Brain, most com- monly arrives at its maximum, at the age of three years, and remains without diminution the whole of after Life; the maxi- mum being in general from 20000 to22000 grains, and seldom exceeding 24000; 2. That the weight of the Brain Proper, at the age of three years, does not in general exceed 21000, nor that of the Cerebellum 2000 grains, the weight of the former * De Peniti'or, &c. p. 254. f Same book, Tab.

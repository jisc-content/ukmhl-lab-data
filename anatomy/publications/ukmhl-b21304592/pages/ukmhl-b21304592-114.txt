Sfc â€¢ SUBSTANCE Of THE BIUAIN. In order to expose the whole superior surface of the Corpus Callosum, the Hemispheres must be cut away on each side, to a level with it. It then appears of an oblong shape, and symmetrical lengthways, the Median line corresponding with the Me- dian Line of the Brain Proper. It is arched from before backwards. Its anterior margin is convex, and its pos- terior concave. It swells out gradually from before 1 jack- wards, until within a third of its posterior extremity, when it begins to taper again. The posterior margin, however* is wider than the anterior ; the one being about three quar- ters, and the other about half an inch. Its long diameter taken on the Median Line is about three inches. Two small Longitudinal Ridges run along the middle of this surface, one on each side of the Median Line. They are about a twelfth of an inch distant from each other be- fore, and in general, though not always, a little farther apart behind. They ai'e seldom exactly parallel to each other, but bend a little in their progress. The space between them is called the Raphe. Slight Transverse Ridges may also in general be seen, extending outwards for a short way, from each of the Longitudinal ones, along the whole of their extent. The whole of this surface of the Corpus Callosum is of a whitish colour. On the inferior surface, or what is often called the Base of the Brain Proper, we remark, in the first place, on the Median Line, the Longitudinal Fissure, extending from the anterior margin, about two inches and a half backwards, and terminated by a smooth, white, perpendicular surface. The roof of this part of the Longitudinal Fissure, is formed by the lower surface of the anterior portion of the Corpus Callosum, which towards the fore-part is similar in its ap- pearance to the superior surface of this body, but tapers to a point behind. It is about half an inch broad before, and

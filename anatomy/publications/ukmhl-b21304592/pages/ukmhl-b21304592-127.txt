CENTRAL FISSURE OF THE BRAIN PROPER. 95 tremity of its Lateral Ridge, and the Inner Corpus Gcnicula- tum ; and below, it is attached to the Vieusseiiian Valve. Under the Lateral Ridge of the Lower Corpus Bigemnum, there is a smooth white surface, which has received no name. It is triangular in its shape, slightly convex towards the back part, and bounded before, by the posterior margin of the Peduncle of the Brain Proper. The Brain Proper, viewed fVom the side, presents a con- vex surface, every where formed into Convolutions. Here we have little to remark* but the length to which the Fis- sure of Sylvius extends backwards, and the relative depths of the three Lobes. The most dependent points of the An- terior and Posterior Lobes are nearly on a level with each other ; while the Middle Lobe projects a considerable way farther down than either. Such are the appearances to be observed on those surfaces of the Brain Proper which we may call External. We have next to examine those which are to be seen on the sides of a deep fissure, which penetrates from the outer surface, in various directions, into the Central parts of the Brain Pro- per, and which we shall call its Central Fissure *. The opening of this Fissure is seen extending, from each side of the Oblong Passage under the posterior extremity of the Corpus Callosum, at first directly outwards, between the Thalamus Opticus and the Corpus Callosum, and then in a curved direction downwards and forwards, close to the outer surface of the Thalamus, until it meets the Fissure of Sylvius about a quarter of an inch anterior to the Outer Corpus Geniculatum, where it terminates. In order to expose it fully, the innermost Convolution of the Middle Lobe must be cut away ; but a small portion of it on each side of the Oblong Passage, may be seen without any dissection. * SVwohym.

194 THE NERVES IN GENERAL. There are slight varieties, too, in their colour ; some arc a little darker than others ; but few of them are so dark in their hue, as the Greyish-Brown Matter of the Central Mass. Their most common colour is Yellowish-White. Their ex- ternal surface is sometimes quite smooth, sometimes floccu- lent or downy. Their strength varies with the thickness and texture of their Coats. They have scarcely any elasticity. There is the utmost variety in the mode of their distribu- tion. Many of them may be seen spreading themselves out by regular ramification ; the branches taken together, in this case, always exceeding the trunk in size. Others divide into branches, which, soon after, unite into trunks again. Others mav be traced into a net-work or Plexus, formed of various Nerves interwoven in every direction, but in which each in- dividual Nerve is in a manner lost; and which sends off new branches to be expended by new ramification, or to unite with new Plexuses. There is but one Nerve in the Body, viz. the Optic Nerve, which neither exhibits ramification, nor is connected with any other Nerve by Plexus, throughout the whole of its course. At the union of two or more Nervous branches with each other, certain knots or tumors frequently present themselves, which have been called Ganglia; and the same name has been extended to similar swellings, which very often occur on single Nerves. These Ganglia are of various shapes and sizes; but none of them exceed three quarters of an inch, or an inch, in any direction. They vary, also, in their colour and consistence ; some being both darker and firmer, than the Nerves to which they are attached; others not. One end of a Nerve is always denominated its Origin, and the other its Termination. Many Nerves are attached directly to the Central Mass; and in such cases, the extremity of the Nerve which happens to be connected to the Brain or Spinal Cord, is invariably

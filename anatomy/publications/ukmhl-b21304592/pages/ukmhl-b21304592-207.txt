DIMENSIONS, WEIGHT, &C. 176 is scarcely an inch thick even where it is thickest, and its diameter at the slenderest part, is usually a little less than half an inch. I have made no trials of its weight, but according to Chaussier *, it is from about a nineteenth to a twenty-fifth of the whole Brain, Like the Brain, it consists of a peculiar Substance em- braced by Membranes. Each of these I shall consider se- The Substance of the Cord does not occupy its whole length, but is shorter by about nine inches. It may be divided into three portions. The first, may be called the Top of the Cord, or the Cranial Portion-j*, as it is contained entirely within the cavity of the Cranium. It extends, from the Annular Protuberance of the Cerebel- lum, downwards, for about an inch; and is thicker above than below. Its transverse diameter at the upper part, is usually about seven eighths of an inch, and its diameter from before backwards about three quarters of an inch; while both these diameters below, are only about four tenths of an inch. The surface of the section, by which it is sepa- rated from the Cerebellum, exhibits precisely the same ap- pearances as the corresponding surface of the Annular Pro- tuberance described p. 113. The second part, I shall call the Cervical Portion of the Cord, because it is lodged in the Cervical region of the Spi- nal Canal. Its length is about five inches. Its transverse diameter above, is about four tenths of an inch, but it gra- dually enlarges to six tenths of an inch, as it extends down- • Exposit. Somraaire, p. 119. •J- Synonyms, lat.

50 THK HEART BEFORE AXD AFTER MATURITY. The colour of the Heart is in general lighter the young- er the subject. Perhaps this is chiefly owing to the thin- ness of the Serous Coat in the earlier periods of life. The Heart of the Foetus never exhibits any white patches or bands, being always completely destitute of Fat. I think I have observed that the Heart in old people ge- nerally acquires a deeper purple hue than it has at the pe- riod of Maturity. In the Auricles of the Heart of a Foetus, there is a very striking peculiarity. There is a hole in the Septum be- tween them, occupying exactly the situation of the Oval Fossa of the Adult Heart, and denominated the Oval Hole. The communication between the Auricles, however, through this hole, is not direct. For if we examine the Heart of a Foetus about the fourth month, we shall find, that there is a thin, pellucid, Membrane, laid over the Oval Hole, like a Valve, on the side next the Left Auri- cle. The insertion of this Valve below, is into the very edge of the lower third of the Oval Hole itself; but above this, its attachment is into the surface of the Sep- tum next the Left Auricle; extending farther and far- ther out from the margin of the Hole as it ascends, until it gets on a level with the upper extremity of the Hole, when it begins to incline inwards again, and after run- ning a short way, ceases, leaving a free floating straight edge, turned upwards and a little to the left. This mar- gin looks a little to the left, because the insertion of the Valve is continued a little farther up on the right side than on the left. As this Valve then is longer than the Oval Hole, it is obvious' that if it were stretched tight across it, like the parchment of a drum, it would prevent all communication between the Auricles at this point. But it is not disposed in this manner. On the contrary, it is twice as broad as

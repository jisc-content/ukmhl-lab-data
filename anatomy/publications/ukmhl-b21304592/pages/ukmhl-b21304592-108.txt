76 ABSORBENT GLANDS TN GENERAL. * Vasor. Lymphat. Hist. p. 30. scription of it given by the indefatigable Mascagni*, is the most correct which we yet possess. According to him, in order to shew the structure of the more superficial parts of the Gland, the whole Gland must be injected with quicksilver, by the Vasa Inferentia. When this is done, the Vasa Inferentia may be seen, just before entering the Gland, dividing into branches. Some of these penetrate directly into the central parts of the Gland, while others are distributed towards the surface. Of these, the larger branches may be distinctly seen bent, convoluted, and interwoven, in every direction; communicating freely with each other; becoming suddenly narrow at some parts, and at others swelling out into little cells, which are so nu- merous, that when they are distended with Mercury, the whole outer surface of the Gland seems covered with little rounded eminences. The smaller branches again are seen, subdividing and forming a net-work on the surface, and then disappearing, some of them by dipping down between the cells of the larger ones, and others by opening into these cells. Arising directly out of these cells, on the other hand, or ascending from between them, various other small Vessels are seen, which after winding about on the surface, run together into larger branches, and then uniting with similar Vessels coming out of the central parts of the Gland, form the Vasa Efferentia. In order to shew the disposition of the Absorbent Vessels in the central parts of the Gland, a different sort of injec- tion is necessary. The Vessels must be filled with fluid w'ax, or glue, or gypsum ; and when the fluid has become hard by rest or cooling, the more superficial parts of the Gland dissected away. In this manner the deeper seated

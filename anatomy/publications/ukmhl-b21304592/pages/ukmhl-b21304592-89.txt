THEIR EXTERNAL APPEARANCE, THICKNESS, &C. 57 branches of the Internal Carotid Artery, have much thin- ner sides, in proportion, than the branches, corresponding in size, of the External Carotid. 5 ... I Arteries are remarkable for their Elasticity. They are elastic both longitudinally and transversely. Whether they be uniformly more elastic in one direction than in another, has not been ascertained; but I have found, in some expe- riments on the Common Carotid, immediately after Death, that a force which extended this Vessel nearly one third transversely, stretched it only about a fifth in the longitudi- nal direction. Mr. Hunter* was of opinion that the elasticity was pro- portionally greater in the large than in the small Arteries; but I am not disposed to place much reliance on his experi- ments relative to this point. It is owing to their elasticity, that we never find the lar- ger Arteries folded or collapsed after Death, even though empty. When cut out from the Body, they always appear as open cylindrical tubes. Being desirous of forming some notion of the strength of an Artery, I cut out about two inches of the Common Carotid of a Man, twelve hours after Death, and inserting a bit of wood into each extremity of the tube, I secured the Artery to them with a waxed thread. One of the pieces of wood was then made fast, by means of a vice screwed to a table, and weights were suspended to the other, so that the Artery was stretched between them. It bore a weight of 30 lbs. Avoirdupois, before it gave way, which it did, close to the upper stick, where I have no doubt it was considera- bly weakened by the application of the thread. A portion of the External Iliac Artery of a full grown man, tried in the same way, bore upwards of 48 lbs. before it broke. * Like the former, however, it gave way close to Treatise on the Blood, See. p. 124.

258 TENDON IN GENElfAL. No one, I believe, lias yet succeeded in demonstrating its Absorbents or Nerves. When Tendon is exposed to a stream of air, it very soon dries, becomes yellowish, transparent, bard, and very elastic. By maceration in Water, it is rendered softer, and floc- culent on its surface, its fibres unfolding themselves very delicately. But this is a very tedious process. When plunged into Boiling Water, it immediately shrinks, loses its shining appearance, becomes yellowish, semitran- sparent, harder, and very elastic. Its Chemical Properties require to be more carefully in- vestigated, than they have yet been. In the meantime, I may observe, 1. That when small portions of it are boiled for a considerable length of time in Water, they are com- pletely dissolved, and the Water jellies on cooling. 2. Sul- phuric, Nitric, and Muriatic Acid act upon it very nearly in the same manner as they do upon Cuticle. The instant it is plunged into either of them, it shrinks up, becomes se- mitransparent, and elastic, just as it does in Boiling Water, but in a much greater degree. 3. The effects of the Pure Fixed Alkalies upon it are singular. At first they operate upon it somewhat like the Acids just mentioned; but in- stead of dissolving it after a while, as these do, they seem to produce very little further change upon it; at least for a considerable length of time. If in this state, we remove it from the Alkali, and pull its parts gently asunder, the de- licate fibres will unfold themselves very readily, exhibiting at same time very bright prismatic colours. Tendon in the Female, differs in no respect, from the same Texture in the Male. In the young subject, this Texture is of a bluer colour, softer, less tough, more vascular, and more easily soluble in Boiling Water than in the Adult. In the Old subject, on the

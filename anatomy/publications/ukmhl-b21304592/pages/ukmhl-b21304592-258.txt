226 MUSCLE IN GENERAL. than this; and in others, greyer. Very thin slices of it are semitransparent. Its consistence, in the Dead Body, is subject to the ut- most variety ; not only from causes operating after, but pre- viously to, Death. The property of Irritability or Contrac- tility, also, which it possesses during Life, and which it is the business of Physiology to treat of, causes its consistence to vary, even in the Living Body. It seems to be composed of delicate Fibres of a peculiar nature; of a substance like Cellular Substance enclosing these Fibres, and uniting them together ; and of Bloodves- sels, Absorbents, and Nerves. Much has been written respecting the Fibres; and a good deal still remains to be investigated. In the meanwhile, Prochaskaâ€™s description of them*, appears to me by far the most accurate. Were we to judge of them, merely from an examination, with the naked eye, of various specimens of Muscle taken in the most recent state from the Dead Body, we should say, that they were soft, straight, reddish-coloured, solid, Fibres; more or less flattened or angular; varying in diame- ter from the twentieth to the hundredth part of an inch,; placed parallel and close to each other; and thus collected into Fasciculi of various sizes, which generally unite with other Fasciculi to form larger ones, and these again with Others, and so on. But there is no Fibre, however small to the naked eye, which may not be seen, by the aid of the microscope, to be composed of Fibres still smaller; and Fibres which, when examined in the recent state, even under the microscope, appear to be simple, in general resolve themselves into Fila- ments still more delicate, after having been for some time exposed to the action of boiling water.

ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR SURFACES OF BRAIN PROPER. 91 Fissure, separating the two Posterior Lobes, and on each side of this, the convex upper surface of these Lobes; on which, we may in general remark, that the Convolutions be* come a little smaller towards the lower margin than above. Very often the surface of these Lobes looking towards the Longitudinal Fissure, instead of being straight from one end to the other, is formed into a slight concavity towards the apex, about half an inch in breadth, and sloping out* wards and downwards. At the bottom of the Longitudinal Fissure, and on the Median Line, is seen the posterior extremity of the Corpus Callosum, rounded like the anterior one, and a very little higher or thicker. To bring this into view, however, the Posterior Lobes must be entirely removed to a level with it. Immediately underneath this extremity of the Corpus CaU losuvi, and on the Median Line also, there is a small Oblong Passage, about a quarter of an inch broad, and half as high, leading horizontally forwards, and formed by the Corpus Callosum above, the Superior Corpora Bigemina below, and the Thalami Â»>ptici on each side. The tip of the Pineal Gland may be seen towards the lower and anterior part of this Passage. From the lower margin of this Passage behind, a Longi- tudinal Furrow, about three eighths of an inch long, is con- tinued downwards and backwards, along the Median Line, separating the Corpora Bigemina of the opposite Hemi- spheres from each other ; and in the bottom of the lower ex- tremity of this Furrow, there is a little white ridge, called the Frenulum, triangular in its shape, about a fifth of an inch long, with its base looking directly downwards, and its apex, upwards and forwards. This Longitudinal Furrow is crossed at right angles about the middle, by a Transverse one, half an inch in length, which separates the Upper Corpus Bigeminum on each side from the Lower.

MUSCLE IN GENERAL. 225 pronounced it to be nothing else but Cellular Substance, in- to the cells of which an Oily Matter has been exhaled But there is obviously no resemblance between its cells and those of that Texture. Clusters of cells of Adipose Substance seem always to be tied together by Cellular Substance ; and vet the cells of the two Textures, do not appear to have the slightest communication with each other. Altogether, I can have no doubt that they are of a different nature. Dr. Hunter * pointed out this distinction long ago, and yet it is singular how much it has been overlooked. The quantity of Adipose Substance diffused over the whole Body, is in general smaller, the younger the sub- ject. It is also more tender, and paler in its colour. In most cases too, the quantity begins to be diminished in the Decline of Life; though by no means in all, as must be con- sistent with the knowledge of every one. Its colour at same time becomes yellower, and I think, upon the whole, that it acquires a firmer and tougher consistence. CHAPTER III. THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF MUSCLE. \ The Texture which Anatomists have distinguished by the term Muscle, is that which is commonly known by the name of Flesh. Those, therefore, who have not seen this Texture in the Human Body, may form a very good idea of it, by an examination of the Flesh of Quadrupeds. Its colour varies a good deal. In most parts, it is of that peculiar tint, which is generally known by the term Flesh- Colour ; but in some organs, it is considerably browner * Medical Obs. and Inquiries. II. p. 33, ft VOL. I.

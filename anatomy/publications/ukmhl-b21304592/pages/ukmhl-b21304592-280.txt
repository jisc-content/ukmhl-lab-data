248 HAIR IN GENERAL. Muriatic Acids first assumed a fine rose colour, and after- wards dissolved the Hair. Nitric Acid turned the Hair yellow, and when assisted by gentle Heat, dissolved it. In this case, the Solution of Black Hair exhibited a Black Oil on its surface, and the Solution of Red Hair, a red Oil; and both of these Oils ultimately grew white, and became concrete on cooling. The same Solution, when properly evaporated, afforded much Oxalic Acid ; and the unchrys- tallizible mother-water contained Bitter Substance, a great deal of Iron, and Sulphuric Acid. Red Hair, in this opera- tion, gave more Sulphuric Acid, and less Iron, than Black. Oxygenated Muriatic Acid Gas first whitened the Hair, soon after softened it, and then reduced it to the form of a viscous and transparent paste like Turpentine, of a bitter taste, and partly soluble in water, partly in Alcohol. 5. Vauquelin found, that Alcohol extracted from Black Hair two kinds of Oil; the one White, which, on cooling, subsides in the form of little shining scales; the other of a Greyish-Green hue, which separates as the Alcohol evapo- rates, and ultimately becomes concrete also. Red Hair, likewise, afforded a White Concrete Oil, like Spermaceti, and another Oil, as Red as Blood, when the Alcohol was evaporated. The Oil from White Hair, was nearly colour- less. 6. From Hair subjected to the action of Fire in close vessels, Vauquelin obtained the same products as from other Animal Substances; with this difference, that it af- forded more Sulphur, and gave out very little Gas. It left in the retort 0.28 or 0.30 of Coal. 7. The same Chemist found, that Hair yielded, by inci- neration, Iron and Manganese, imparting a brownish-yellow colour to the ashes; Phosphat, Sulphat, and Carbonat of Lime ; a little Muriat of Soda; and a considerable portion of Silex. The ashes of Red Hair, were less coloured, be- cause they contained less Iron and Manganese ; and the

243 SKIN IN GENERAL. have not a Tawny Membrane, like the Black Membrane of the Negro, I have had no opportunity of ascertaining. The Skin of the Female is thinner than that of the Male, and the Furrows on its surface are narrower and less deep. I know of no other difference between them. In the Foetus and young subject, the Skin is not thinner, in proportion to the other parts of the Body, than in the Adult. There is an obvious diminution, however, in its thickness in Old Age. The same Furrows may be seen in the youngest Foetus, on the outer surface of the Skin, as in the Adult; and of the same size proportionally. These Furrows, therefore, are not the consequence of frequent folding of the Skin by the action of Muscles, or the bending of Joints. The Wrinkles in old persons, are of a different nature altogether ; they are produced by the wasting of the soft parts which the Skin covers. The Skin is less elastic in the young subject than in the Adult; and less elastic still, in old persons than in young. The True Skin is as thick, proportionally, in the Foetus as at Maturity ; and its structure is the same. The Blood- vessels, however, on its outer surface, are always more easily injected, the younger the subject. The True Skin in old persons is almost always, thinner, proportionally, than in the Adult; and its Vessels are less easily injected. Except the difference of thickness, and a slight diminu- tion in its elasticity in Old Age, the Cuticle is the same throughout the whole of Life*. â€¢ The Nails will be considered along with the Integuments of the Extremi? ties, in a different part of the Work.

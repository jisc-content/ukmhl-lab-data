WEIGHT of the foetus. 21 The average weight of the Foetus at the Full Time is about 7 lbs. Avoirdupois. Du. Hunter* states, that, of se- veral thousand new-born and perfect Children, which were weighed at the British Hospital in London by Du. Macau- lay, the smallest was about 4 lbs. and the largest about 11 lbs. 2 oz ; but by far the greater number were from 5 to 8 lbs. Avoirdupois. He adds, that he himself never knew an instance of a Child, born at the natural period, weigh- ing 12 lbs. Avoirdupois. Of sixty male, and sixty female children, born at the Full time, which were weighed by Dr. Clarke-]', the lightest was 4 lbs. and the heaviest 10 lbs ; and the average weight was 7 lbs. 13 dr. Avoirdupois. RoedererJ weighed eighteen Male, and eight Female Children, born at the natural period ; and if the weights he employed do not differ materially from Avoirdupois, the average weight of the twenty-six Children, was about 64 lbs; the heaviest being 8 lbs. and the lightest about lbs. Dr. Clarke found that the average weight of sixty male children, born at the Full Time, was 7 lbs. 5 oz. 7 dr. Avoirdupois ; and of sixty Females, only 6 lbs. 11 oz. 6 drams. He therefore, estimates the difference between the weight of the Male and Female at Birth, at about 9 oz. Avoirdupois. The results of Roederer’s observations do not, probably, differ much from this estimate ; though I am uncertain as to the weights he employed. Supposing them to have been equivalent to Avoirdupois, the mean weight of eighteen Males, born at the Natural period, which he weighed at Birth, was 6 lbs. 10 oz. 3 dr ; and of eight Fe- males, 6 lbs. 4 oz. 4 drams. In cases of Twins, it would appear, that the weight of each Twin, is, in general, less than the average weight of Single Children, though their combined weight is greater.

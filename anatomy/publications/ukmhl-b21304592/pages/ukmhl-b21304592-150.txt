118 SUBSTANCE OF THE BHAIN. half of its inner extremity presents a smooth,- white, convex surface, hounded below by a ridge of the breadth of a hair, which extends forwards and outwards, and is the connection and continuation of the Wingsof the Inferior Vermiform Pro- cess. At all other parts it consists of small Lamina. Below, it rests upon the Spinal Lobule from which it is separated by a fissure; it forms a part of the Peduncular Fossa by its upper surface, and a portion of the Spinal Fossa by its in- ner extremity. Under the Sub-peduncular Lobule, is that portion of each Hemisphere which we have denominated the Spinal Lo- bule*. Of this, one side looks downwards and is convex, forming the most prominent part of the lower surface of the Cerebellum ; another, turned forwards and inwards, is con- cave, and constitutes almost one half of the Spinal Fossa ; a third, which is much rounded, looks upwards and back- wards, and supports the Wings of the Inferior Vermiform Process : a fourth is quite flat, and forms part of the side of the Median Fossa, coming so close to the corresponding part of the opposite Hemisphere, as to conceal from our view the middle portion of the Inferior Vermiform Process. Its greatest height and breadth is about an inch. All its sur- faces exhibit Lamina. Those on the lower aspect form a curve, with the concavity looking forwards and inwards, and have their upper extremities terminated, by the fissure which separates this Lobule from the Sub-peduncular Lo- bule. We may call that part of the lower surface of each He- misphere, the Inferior Lobe, which is bounded behind by the Posterior Lobe ; before, by the Anterior Lobe, and the Peduncular Fossa ; and on the inner and forepart, by the â€¢Synonyms. Lat. Tubercula Lateralis Anteriora Inferiors Cerebelli. Ft. Xe Lobule de la Moelle Alongee.

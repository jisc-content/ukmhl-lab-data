STATURE OP THE FEMALE AND FOETU3. 17 From between the Pudendal Region and the inside of the Thigh, to the Joint of the Knee on the inch. inside 14c 6 From the Joint of the Knee on the inside, to the Sole of the Foot 18.5 The Foot, measured on the Sole from the posterior margin of the Heel, to the point of the Great Toe 9.75 The average Height of the Female, at the period of Ma- turity, seems to be about 5 feet, 5 inches; and the length of the different regions is proportionally less than in the Male. The Embryo of three or four weeks, represented by Soemmerring, and which we have already compared to a mustard seed just beginning to grow, measures only about 4 of an inch. At the sixth week, an Embryo examined by Wrisberg*, measured from 44 to 4-| of an inch. At the seventh week, an Embryo represented by Soem- merring, is only 4 of an inch. At eight weeks, an Embryo represented by the same, measures 4 of an inch. At nine weeks, an Embryo represented by the same, is 14 inch. At ten weeks, an Embryo represented by the same, is 24 inches ; and one of the same age described and deline- ated by WaiSBERG-f-, measured 2^ inches. An Embryo delineated by Soemmerring, of about eleven weeks, measures 3 inches. At the twelfth week, an Embryo represented by the same, is about 34 Inches. â€¢ De Vita foetuum, &c. f Desoriptio Anatomica Embryonis. VOL. I. U

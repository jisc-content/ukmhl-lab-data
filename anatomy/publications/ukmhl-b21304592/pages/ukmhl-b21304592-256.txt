ADIPOSE SUBSTANCE IN GENERAE. f Med. Ob9er. and Inquiries. II. p. 34. I judge so, at least, from an examination of different por- tions of Adipose Texture, taken from the Dead Body, and raised to the temperature of the Living; for the fact can- not be easily ascertained on the Living Body itself. In all Surgical Operations, however, I observe, that when a thick portion of Adipose Substance happens to be divided, minute globules of Oil may be seen swimming, in great abundance, in the stream of Blood that flows from the wound. As to the Vascular Cellular Texture which contains the Oily Matter, it appears to consist of little spherical cells, placed closely together, side by side. These cannot be dis- tinctly seen without a magnifying glass. They vary a little in their size, but are all exceedingly minute. I have made no measurement of them ; but according to Dr. Monro*, none of them exceed the eight-hundreth part of an inch, nor are less than the six-hundredth. One cannot be certain whether they communicate with each other; though I perfectly agree with Dr. HiJNTER-f*, that the incompressibility of Adipose Substance, and the impossibility of moving its Oily Matter from one portion of it to another, by means of moderate pressure, renders such communication extremely improbable. Of the nature of the Texture which forms the cells, I know nothing, but that it seems to be fully as delicate as Cellular Substance, equally transparent, and, like it, to exhi- bit an appearance of slender filaments, when raised with the point of a needle, and inspected with the microscope. Abun- dance of little Bloodvessels may be seen running through it, though it is not perhaps upon the whole so Vascular as Cellular Substance ; and both Absorbents and Nerves, by proper management, may sometimes be traced into it, to a considerable degree of minuteness.

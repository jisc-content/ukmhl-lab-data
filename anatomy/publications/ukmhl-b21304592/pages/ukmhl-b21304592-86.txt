The tubes denominated Bloodvessels are of two kinds. Arteries and Veins. OF THE ARTERIES. The whole Arterial System of the Human Body may be compared to the trunks and branches of two trees. One Trunk, denominated the Pulmonary Artery, arises from the Right Ventricle of the Heart, and the other, called the Aorta, springs from the Left. Both of these, at their root, are about an inch and a quarter in diameter, and their sides are about a twelfth of an inch thick. Immediately after their origin, they send off branches, which are distributed by Successive ramification, to all parts of the Body, and divide at last into Vessels much smaller than the finest hair. . The branches as well as the trunks of Arteries, are in ge- neral of a cylindrical shape; but where an Artery divides into two large branches, we always observe that it swells out a little at the point of division. The modes of ramification are very various. Sometimes an Arterial Trunk runs on for a considerable length, giv- ing off branches in every direction, and yet not undergoing any diminution in size. At other times, and this is by far the most common mode, the Vessel ends by dividing into two or more large branches. These branches are sometimes equal, sometimes unequal, in diameter; but whatever be their relative size, it is invariably found, that their combin- ed area is greater than the area of the trunk from which

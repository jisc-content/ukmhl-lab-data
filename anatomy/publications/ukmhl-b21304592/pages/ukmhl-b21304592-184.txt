MEMBRANES OF THE BltAIN. 152 which the Bloodvessels arc bound together and interlaced; but I have looked for this Tissue in vain. All the Arterial Vessels which enter into the composition of this Membrane, seem destined ultimately to supply the Substance of the Brain, and this Substance appears to de- rive Arterial Vessels from no other source. All the Veins too of the Tia Mater, are derived from the Substance of the Brain, and it seems to send all its Venous Vessels to this Membrane; so that we may regard the Pia Mater as a vas- cular covering, formed of Bloodvessels which are just about to penetrate the Nervous Matter of the Brain, and of Blood- vessels which have just emerged from it; of Arteries, which by repeated ramifications, are preparing themselves to enter the Substance of this organ, (for we have already seen that this Substance contains only Vessels of small size,) and of Veins which after having come out of it, are uniting into larger trunks. In consequence of this, it will be found, that all the smaller, or Capillary, Arteries and Veins of the Pia Mater, are situated towards that surface of the Membrane, which is nearest to the Substance of the Brain, and all the larger branches, in the parts placed at a greater distance from it, or more externally. It is chiefly the close intertexture of the former, which gives to the Pia Mater its Membran- ous form; the larger Vessels are not so closely interwoven, nor so firmly attached to each other. In by far the great- er number of parts, the delicate Arteries which penetrate the Substance of the Brain, and the Veins which come out, will be found entering and emerging at right angles to the surface of the part. This is easily seen in peeling off the Membranes from a recent Brain. In the angle be- tween the Pia Mater and the part of the Substance of the Brain which it covers, an immense number of very delicate, semitransparent, threads, will be observed, stretching from the one to the other; and these are the fine Bloodvessels drawn out of the soft Nervous Matter.

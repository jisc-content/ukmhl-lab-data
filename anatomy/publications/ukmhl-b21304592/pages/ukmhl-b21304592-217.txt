MEMB11ANES OF THE SPINAL COltD. 185 It id we; the inner half, consists of Yellowish-White Matter with a tinge of Red, except the Ridges on the Triangular I'ossa, which are Orange-White. In the upper half of the Top of the Cord, there is a stra- tum of White Matter about a fiftieth of an inch thick, which occupies the whole of the Median Plane, running from the bottom of one Median Fissure to the other. This stratum, when divided horizontally, appears rather whiter than the White Matter it passes through, but when cut vertically, rather darker. Numerous small Bloodvessels may be seen in it, placed horizontally, and penetrating from the anterior to the posterior surface of the Cord. This stratum is con- tinuous with a similar one, already described in the Annular Protuberance of the Cerebellum. From the above description, it will be seen, that the upper half of the Top of the Cord, contains a much larger propor- tion of White Nervous Matter, than any other part of this prolongation. I say nothing at present with respect to the effects of coa- gulation on the different portions of the Substance of the Cord ; because I have not yet completed my experiments on this subject. I find however, that considerable portions of it, are rendered fibrous in the longitudinal direction, by this operation. The Membranes of the Spinal Cord are three: the Pia Mater, the Serrated Membrane *, and the Arachnoid Mem- brane. The Pia Mater embraces immediately the whole surface of the substance of the Cord, except the Triangular Fossa. It is nowhere thicker than a sixtieth of an inch, but is den- ser and of a closer texture, than any pai . of the correspond- ing Membrane of the Brain. * Syhohvm. Lat. Ligamentum Denta'i

19 STATURE AFTER MATURITY. ception. He has observed, however, that the growth does not proceed in a uniform ratio; but that it is a little re- tarded, during the second month ; accelerated, during the third; again somewhat retarded, at the beginning of the fourth ; from the middle of the fourth to the sixth, again accelerated; and from this period till the end of the ninth month, once more retarded. The Male and Female differ, in dimensions, even in the Foetal state. Roederer* found the mean length of six- teen Male children, born at the Full Time, to be 20|4 inch- es ; and of eight Females, only 20^- inches. Dr. Clarke-)* measured the Heads of sixty Male, and sixty Female Children born at the Natural Period, and he found that the circumference passing through the middle of the Brow and the Occipital Protuberance, was, on an average, 14< inches in the Males, and only 13| inches in the Females; and the Arch, from Ear to Ear over the Crown, 7T4 inches in the Males, and only 7j- inches in the Females. Out of one hundred and twenty children, there were only six, in whom the circumference of the Head exceeded 144 inches, and these six were males. Both Sexes have usually arrived at their full Stature at the period of Maturity. The changes which take place in the External appearance of the Body, between this period and the commencement of the Decline of Life, are perhaps more owing to slight alterations of Form in particular Re- gions, than to any very sensible difference of total Dimen- sions. But in the Decline of Life, there is, in general, an obvious diminution of Stature. The degree of the diminu- tion varies very much in different individuals ; but in all it seems to take place, to the greatest extent, in the Regions of the Head and Trunk. The Head is diminished in all its Dimensions, the Trunk chiefly in Length. â€¢ Comment. Soc. Reg. Scient. Gotting. ivjccciiii. f PhU. Trans; 1786. 2

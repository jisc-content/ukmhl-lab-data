NERVOUS MATTER OE PARTICULAR PARTS. 139 stratum described at p. 132, all at the same time inclining upwards and outwards. They vary a good deal in their length, few or none of them penetrating entirely across the Corpus Striatum, but disappearing gradually in its Brown Matter. The mass from which these fibres and plates are derived, and the portion of the Corpus Striatum into which they shoot, are easily distinguished from each other in a transverse section of the Hemisphere by their co- lour ; the former being considerably paler than the latter. The whole remaining parts of the Hemisphere, may be re- garded as forming a centre or nucleus, from which the White strata of all the Convolutions project, and which therefore, for the sake of brevity, I shall call the Central Mass of the Convolutions. This Mass is connected all round with the Corpus Callosum, and with the prolongations from this body and from the Fornix, denominated the Hippocampus and the Colliculus. The stratum of white matter also, which is pro- longed from the Peduncles, and the cord called the Anterior Commissure of the Brain, are continued into it. The por- tion of it which supplies the Convolutions of the Posterior Part of the Anterior Lobe, sends down a stratum almost parallel to the Median Plane, and immediately on the out- side of the Corpus Striatum, to join the portion which sup- plies the Convolutions of the Middle Lobe. This stratum is about a sixth of an inch in thickness above and before, but nearly a quarter of an inch below and behind; and it is split throughout into two laminae by an intervening layer of Greyish-Brown Matter, which is the only portion of this kind of Matter which occurs in the whole Central Mass of the Convolutions. It is from this stratum, that the small Convolutions situated at the bottom of the Fissure of Sylvius, are supplied. The Laminae of the Cerebellum, like the Convolutions of the Brain Proper, are all formed of a layer of Orange-Wliite

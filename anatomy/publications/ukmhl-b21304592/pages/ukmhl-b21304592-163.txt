NERVOUS MATTER OF PARTICULAR PARTS. 131 face of the Anterior Lobe of each Hemisphere; forming a part of the perpendicular plane formerly described, as stretch- ing downwards from the inferior surface of the Corpus Cal- losum, towards the Commissure of the Tractus Optici. Hav- ing reached the lower margin of the Longitudinal Fissure, it turns outwards, and acquiring more and more of a Yellow- ish-White colour, extends as far nearly, as the Inner Lobule of the Middle Lobe. Between this band and the cord prolonged from the An- terior Pillars of the Fornix into the Mamillary Eminence, there is a stratum of Greyish-Brown Matter, which is bound- ed above, by the Anterior Commissure of the Brain Proper, and attached below, to the Commissure of the Tractus Optici. The Anterior Commissure of the Brain Proper, is con- tinuous on each side with an Orange-White cord, about an eighth of an inch in diameter, and an inch in length ; which extends through the Corpus Striatum, first outwards and a little forwards, then downwards and a little outwards and backwards, and terminates in the stratum of Orange-White Matter which supplies the Convolutions of the Middle Lobe, close to the Inner Lobule of that Lobe. The Tractus Optici and their Commissure, are formed entirely of Orange-White Matter. The sides of the Infundibulum consist wholly of Greyish- Brown Matter; and it is this Matter, which surrounds and conceals the prolongation from the Anterior Pillars of the Fornix into the Mammillary Eminences. The Mammillary Eminences are formed of Greyish-Brown Matter, surrounded completely by a layer, about a twen- tieth of an inch thick, of Orange-White Matter. It is to this White layer, that the prolongations from the Anterior Pillars of the Fornix already described, are attached. It sends off also from its upper surface, a cord about a sixth of an inch in diameter, which runs upwards and outwards into the Thalamus Opticus for the length of half an inch, de- scribing first a curve forwards and then backwards, and gar-

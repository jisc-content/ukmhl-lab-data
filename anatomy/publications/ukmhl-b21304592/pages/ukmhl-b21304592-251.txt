219 ORIGINS OF THE SPINAL NERVES. The whole of the Sacral Nerves, together with the three lower Lumbar Nerves, extend beyond the lower extremity of the Cord, before they perforate the Arachnoid Membrane; and the farther beyond it, the higher their Origins. All these are accumulated together into a large Bundle, which fills the whole remaining part of the Spinal Canal. They are slightly tied together by delicate Bloodvessels; and partly, also, by fine, dense, thi-eads, such as those that are found between the Arachnoid Membrane and Pia Mater in par- ticular parts, only a great deal longer. The whole Bundle is surrounded, loosely, by the Arachnoid Membrane, pro- longed from the Spinal Cord above. In speaking of the inclination of each of the Nerves indi- vidually, which compose this Bundle, I have supposed them to be stretched out, in a straight line, from their Origin to the point at which they perforate the Arachnoid Mem- brane. But this is not their actual position in the Body. In consequence of their exceeding in length, considerably, a straight line drawn from their Origins to the points at which they pass out of the Spinal Canal, they have a bent, or convoluted, or serpentine course; and appear, even when viewed through the transparent Arachnoid Membrane, as if they were twisted a little round each other.

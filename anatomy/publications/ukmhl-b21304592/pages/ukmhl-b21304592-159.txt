BROWN NERVOUS MATTER. 127 The Brown Nervous Matter in certain parts of the Brain, is much more vascular than the White. Such, for example, is the coating of it, which covers the outer sur- face of flie Convolutions of the Brain Proper, and of the Lamina of the Cerebellum. These parts, it is true, do not contain any Bloodvessels, which are absolutely larger than some, that are to be found in White Nervous Matter; but their capillary branches are, proportionally, so much wid- er and more numerous, that when they are filled with a fine injection of size and vermilion, they give a bright red colour to the whole substance through which they are distributed. If a piece of this substance be macerated af- ter such an injection, or examined with a powerful micros- cope, it will appear as if almost entirely composed of Blood- vessels. Aebinus*, however, affirms, that even after the most minute injection, he could still discover something more than Bloodvessels in this Matter. Whether the Brown Nervous Matter be more vascular than the other species, in all parts of the Brain, does not yet seem to have been ascertained. Absorbents have not yet been traced into this kind of Nervous Matter, more than into the White species. When a portion of the Brown Nervous Matter which forms a covering to the Convolutions of the Brain Proper or the Lamina of the Cerebellum, has been exposed to the action of Alcohol, or Acids, or Boiling Oil, and is then torn asunder, it exhibits a fibrous appearance similar to that al- ready described in the White Matter. Whether the Brown Matter in all parts of the Brain be susceptible of this sort of fibrous laceration, I have not yet ascertained, in a man- ner satisfactory to myself. When macerated in cold water, the Brown Nervous Matter becomes softer, swells out a little, and loses a good * Anuot. Acad. Lib. I. cap. 12.

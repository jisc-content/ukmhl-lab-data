ARTERIAL AND AURICULAR ORIFICES. 33 ous Cords, that go to be attached to the edge of the Tri- cuspid Valve immediately to be described. These are larg- er than the other Fleshy Columns, and are, in general^ three or four in number. The largest arises from the mid- dle of the anterior side of the Cavity, and the other two or three, from the middle of the inferior side, or of the angle between that and the posterior. Lastly, some of the Co- lumns are usually found inserted into the outer surface of the Tricuspid Valve, towards its root. The size and distribution, however, of all these Columns, vary very much in different individuals; and the whole appearance of the net-work, is never precisely the same, in any two subjects. Towards the Upper Angle of the Ventricle, the surface becomes gradually smoother, and sometimes the ridges dis- appear altogether. This smooth surface terminates in a circular opening, looking upwards, backwards, and to the right, from which the Pulmonary Artery springs, and which is denominated the Arterial Orifice of the Ventricle. The three Semilunar Valves which are found here, partly attached to the margin of the opening, will be afterwards described along with the Pulmonary Artery. Occupying the lower and posterior part of the base of the Cavity, and separated from the Upper Angle only by a smooth fleshy ridge, is the Auricular Orifice of the Ventricle. Attached to the circumference of this orifice, all round, there is a sort of curtain of a white, thin, semi-transparent substance, quite pliable, but very tough and strong, which, is folded towards the Ventricle. Its opposite margin is formed into three unequal Flaps, of a parabolic shape, and hence the name Tricuspid Valve has been given to it. These Flaps correspond in situation to the three sides of the Ven tricle; the Anterior which is the largest, is applied close to the anterior side; the Posterior, the next in point of siae, VOL. I. D

ORIGINS or THE CEREBRAL NERVES. 205 I have often lacerated the part of the Olfactory Nerve just described, after it had been coagulated by Acids, Alcohol, Sic.; and find that it tears very readily in the longitudinal direction; at same time I cannot say that I have yet seen any distinct fibrous appearance on the lacerated surfaces. The Olfactory Nerves not unfrequently differ a little from each other in shape, dimensions, and structure, in the same subject. Soemmerring * states, that the portion of the Olfactory Nerve we are now considering, is rounder, shorter, and thick- er, in the Foetus, than in the Adult, proportionally. Ac- cording to Scarpa-}*, it seems to contain no White Nervous Matter at all in the Foetus, but to consist entirely of Brown ; the White Matter only appearing as the individual advances towards Maturity. In the Decline of Life, on the other hand, he has observed, that the Brown Matter seems to dis- appear, leaving nothing but White. Origins of the Optic Nerves. The Optic Nerve, on each side, arises from the anterior corner of the Commissure of the Tractus Optici. It inclines forwards, outwards, and a little downwards, for about three eighths of an inch, closely applied to the lower Surface of the Anterior Lobe, within the Origin of the Olfactory Nerve, and then perforates the Arachnoid Membrane. Throughout this short course, it is cylindrical in its shape, and about a sixth of an inch in diameter, in general. For about an eighth of an inch from its Origin, it consists of one, undivided, cylinder of White Nervous Matter, sur- * De Corp. Hum. Fabric. IV. p. 197. + Anat. Annotat Lib. II. p. 27. This is the best treatiie that has yet been written on the Anatomy of the Olfactory Nerves.

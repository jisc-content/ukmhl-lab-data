LOWER SURFACE OF THE BRAIN PROPER. 83 three fourths of an inch long, and is slightly arched from before backwards. Its colour is white. Behind, it is con- tinued into a narrow groove, about a quarter of an inch in length, of the same white colour. These parts may be brought into view, merely by separating the Hemispheres gently from each other ; but they are better seen when the Hemispheres are cut away to a level with the bottom of the Fissure. From the perpendicular surface terminating the Longi- tudinal Fissure behind, a smooth surface about a quarter of an inch in length, is continued downwards and a little forwards, to unite with the Commissure of the Tractus Optici. The colour of this surface is greyish, with white lines run- ning from above, downwards and inwards. The substance which I denominate the Commissure of the Tractus Optici*, is of an oblong shape, having the Tractus Optici attached to its posterior corners, and the Optic Nerves to its anterior. Its long diameter, which is dbout half an inch, is placed across the Median Line; its breadth is about a fifth of an inch, and its thickness about an eighth. Its surfaces are flat; one looking upwards, and a little for- wards, and the other in the opposite direction. Its margins are slightly concave; the anterior and lateral ones being free, while the posterior and upper is attached to the grey sur- face just mentioned, and the posterior and lower to the Infundibulum. Immediately behind this Commissure, are situated the Pituitary Gland and Infundibulum. The Pituitary Gland t is a substance somewhat of an oval shape, the long diameter of the oval being placed across the Median Line. Its upper surface is flat; the rest con- vex. It is about five twelfths of an inch long, a quarter of â€¢ Synonyms. Ldt. Docussatio NerVorum Opticorum. Fr. La Reunion, La Jonction, Le Contours, des Nerves Optiqueg. "t Sthowm. Lai. Hypophysis. 2

116 SUBSTANCE OF THE BRAIN. Proceeding from before backwards, we observe in the first place, a Fossa beginning at the Semilunar Fossa on the inside, and extending downwards and outwards for nearly an inch and three fourths, in the form of a curve, with the concavity upwards. The sides of this Fossa touch each other, and are formed above by the extremities of the La- mina: of the Anterior Lobe, and below by the extremities of those belonging to the Sub-peduncular Lobule and inferior Lobe. In the middle, it is nearly half an inch deep, but shallower at each end. At the bottom of it, appears the Peduncle of the Cerebellum; and on that account, I shall distinguish it by the name of the Peduncular Fossa. The Peduncle*, is a portion of the Cerebellum which ex- tends from the lower and lateral part of the Annular Pro- tuberance, outwards, backwards, and a little downwards. One surface of this Peduncle, is smooth, white, and slight- ly convex, and looks upwards and backwards. We already had occasion to take notice of it, when describing the Semi- lunar Fossa, lying on the outside of the Pillar of the Vieus- senian Valve. The extremities of the inner Lamina of the Anterior Lobes rest upon it, and conceal it entirely from our view in the natural situation of parts. In the direc- tion from the Pillar of the Vieussenian Valve outwards, it measures about half an inch, but scarcely more than a quar- ter of an inch from before backwards. The upper portion of the Trigeminal Nerve is attached to it, at its most ante- rior point, just where it is passing into the Annular Pro- tuberance. Another surface of the Peduncle looks forwards and out- wards. This is continuous with the lateral surface of the Annular Protuberance, and is the surface which presents itself at the bottom of the Peduncular Fossa just described. * Synonyms. ImI.

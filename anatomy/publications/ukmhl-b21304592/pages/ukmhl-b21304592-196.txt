164 MEMBRANES OK THE BRAIN. ter. Towards the anterior part of the Membrane, they are closely in contact with each other ; but behind, they sepa- rate to the distance of nearly half an inch, leaving a sort of island between them, and then coalesce as before. Their termination is in the Lower Median Sinus* of the Dura Ma- ter ; into which they open at its anterior extremity. Some- times, immediately before opening into the Sinus, they unite into one Vessel. The small veins from the superior surface of the Cere- bellum, form three or four Trunks of inconsiderable size, which inclining towards the Median Line and the Mons Cerebelli, open into the Lower Median Sinus also, pene- trating through its lower side. The capillary Venous Vessels on the inferior surface of the Cerebellum, unite, on each Hemisphere, into two or three Trunks, each scarcely more than a tenth of an inch in diameter. These incline backwards and outwards, and winding round the margin of the Cerebellum, ascend to- wards the Lateral Sinus of the Dura Mater, and penetrate into this Sinus, through its inferior parietes. All these Venous Vessels just described, are in general easily distinguished in the recent Brain, in consequence of the quantity of Blood which is usually found collected in them, and the extreme delicacy of the Membranes with which they are embraced, and which they in part contribute to form. Their apparent size will vary according to the quantity of Blood with which they are distended; and this depends, partly, I believe, on accidental circumstances ac- companying the cessation of the Circulation, but chiefly, as I am convinced from many observations, upon the position which the Head is permitted to assume after Death, or dur- ing dissection.

THEIR SHAPE—SIZE—COLOUR—SUBSTANCE. 75 Anatomy of the Absorbing Vessels, p. 80. an inch. They are smooth on the surface, and of a grey- ish-pink colour, in general; some, however, are blueish, and a few almost jet black. We may consider them as consisting of two parts ; a pe- culiar Substance, and a thin Membrane surrounding this, like a Capsule. The Substance of the Absorbent Glands, seems chiefly composed of ramifications of Absorbent Vessels, closely com- pacted together. The Absorbent Vessels which enter a Gland, are called the Vasa Inferentia; those which come out of it, the Vasa Effe* rentia. These are easily distinguished from each other, by the direction of their Valves. The free margins of the Valves in a Vas Inferens, always look towards the Gland. The number of Absorbent Vessels which enter a Gland, is exceedingly various ; sometimes there is only one, at other times, more than thirty. The number of the Vasa Inferen- tia and the Vasa Efferentia seldom correspond. In general, the former are more numerous. Cruiksiiank* says he has injected fourteen Vasa Inferentia belonging to one Gland, and yet to all these, only one Vas Efferens corresponded. Very often, however, the Vasa Efferentia are more numerous than the other. A In general, towards the trunks of the Absorbent System, the Vasa Efferentia are larger than the Vasa Inferentia. But in other parts, it is sometimes the one set of Vessels, and sometimes the other, which is largest; and very often they are exactly equal in size. My own observations on the arrangement of the Absorb- ent vessels within the Substance of the Glands, have hith- erto been very few. I have investigated this piece of Anatomy, however, enough to be satisfied, that the de-

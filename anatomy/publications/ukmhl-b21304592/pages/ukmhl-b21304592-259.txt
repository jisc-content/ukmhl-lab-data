MUSCLE IN GENERAL. 227 while it strengthens the Fibres, and renders them more opaque, seems to soften or dissolve the connecting medium between them. We should form then but a very imperfect idea, it is ob- vious, of the structure of the Muscular Fibres, were we to content ourselves with such an analysis as can be made of them in their unprepared state, and without the assistance of magnifying glasses. Prochaska has employed these means with great industry; and the following are tiie re- sults of his investigations. In the first place, the Fibrous part of every species of Muscle, may ultimately be resolved, into Fibres of the same form, dimensions, and general appearance. The tenuity of these is very great; their diameter not much exceeding, the forty-thousandth part of an inch, perhaps *. There is not the least appearance of their being divisible into smaller Fibres ; Prochaska seems to have no doubt that these are the smallest Fibres of Muscle. He calls them Fila Carnea ; but I am rather inclined to denominate them, the Primary Muscular Fibres'f*. They are very variable in their length. It may be collected from some of Prochaskaâ€™s observations, that he conceives they extend, in some parts, to nearly three feet. However long they are, they preserve the same diameter throughout. As far as one can judge from a transverse section o/ them, none of them are perfectly cir- cular in their shape; they are all more or less flattened or angular. They have no appearance of hollowness; but seem to be solid diaphanous filaments In the second place, these Primary Fibres, placed parallel and close to each other, are in the first instance united into * Prochaska says, that he found their diameter to be, seven or eight times the greatest diameter of a red globule of the Blood. The term Primary is here employed in the same manner as the word Simple is by chemists, as denoting something not yet demonstrated to be Com- pound. 2

THE HEART EXTERNALLY VIEWED. 29 A slight furrow marks the division between the two Au- tides externally. They differ a good deal from eadi other in point of shape ; and the Right appears larger than the Left. Neither of them rises so high, by one half, as the upper angle of the Right Ventride ; but there is a little Tip or Lappet, which projects upwards from the superior, left, and anterior comer of the Right one, and from the su- perior, left, and posterior corner of the Left. It is this Lappet, which, from its resemblance to the tip of the dogâ€™s ear, seems to have given rise to the term Auricle. The Tip of the Right Auricle, has an even margin, and points a lit- tle backwards and to the right; the Tip of the Left, which is narrower, and is twisted like the letter S, has a notched margin, and points a little forwards and to the left. The trunks of three Veins are usually seen opening into the Right Auricle; viz. the two Cava (Vena Cava,) and the Coronary Vein. The Superior Cava enters at the right, upper, and anterior corner; the Inferior Cava, at the right, lower, and posterior one; and the Coronary Vein at the left, lower, and posterior corner. Four Veins called Pulmonary, are seen entering into the Left Auricle. The two Right Pulmonary Veins enter at its right and anterior angles; and the two Left, at its right and posterior angles. The boundaries between the two Ventricles externally, are marked by two superficial furrows, one below and an- other above. The former runs nearly parallel to the groove dividing the Auricles, but is a little farther forward ; and the latter, beginning immediately before the tip of the Left Auricle, extends to the left and a little forwards, and then passing over the apex of the Heart, is continued into the, one below. One large Artery, called the Pulmonary Artery, is seen arising from the Right Ventricle at its upper angle ; and from a point of the Left Ventricle, immediately underneath

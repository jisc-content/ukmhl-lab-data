SUBSTANCE OF THE BRAIN. 136 ing at the base, between the two white Laminae already men- tioned ; and in two nstances, I have found it quite hollow, and without any external orifice. In the Thalami Optici, there is an intermixture of White and Brown Nervous Matter, which it is very difficult to de- scribe. Each Thalamus, however, is surrounded at all points by a coating of Orange-White Matter. This coating is exceedingly thin, on the side which looks towards the Vertical Prolongation of the Central Fissure; so thin in- deed, that unless the Brain be examined in a very recent state, it may escape notice altogether; yet it seems to me to be a good deal tougher than the White Matter in other parts of the Brain. On the other surfaces of the Thalamus, the coating is considerably thicker, but not uniformly thick at all points ; it is deepest where it forms the ridge called the Peduncle of the Pineal Gland. Along the whole inner margin of the Corpus Striatum, it is connected with the stratum of Orange-White Matter already described as con- tinuous with the Peduncles of the Brain Proper; this stra- tum forming, in a manner, the boundary between the Tha- lamus and the Corpus Striatum. On the side of the Thalamus next the Median Plane, the thin covering of White Matter just described, is laid over a layer about a twelfth of an inch thick of Greyish-Brown Matter. It is this stratum, which, shining through the for- mer, gives the whole of this surface its dark colour; and it seems to be a portion of this too, which, continued into the corresponding part of the opposite Thalamus, forms what has been called the Commissure of the Thalami Optici. Under the superficial white covering in each of the Tu- bercles of the Thalami, there is a nodule of Nervous Mat- ter of a colour between Wood-Brown and Yellowish-White. The Stratum of Orange-White Matter continued from the Peduncles of the Brain Proper, and bounding the Tha- lami on the outside, sends off a great number of White la-

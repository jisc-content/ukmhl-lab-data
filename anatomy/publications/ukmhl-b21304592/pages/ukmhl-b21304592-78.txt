46 PARTS composing the sides of the heart. branch of the Anterior Coronary formerly described, where it terminates. It supplies branches to the Auricle and the Ventricle. All the remaining branches of this Artery are distribut- ed on the V entricles. The larger ones go to the Left Ven- tricle, coming off at acute angles, and winding obliquely round the posterior margin of the Heart. Smaller branches are distributed on the Right Ventricle; and others still smaller penetrate the bottom of the furrow directly, to sup- ply the Septum. This vessel, like the Anterior Coronary, runs between the Serous Membrane and the Muscular Coat; and all its branches ramify to an equal degree of minuteness, in this superficial situation, before they insinuate themselves be- tween the Muscular fibres. All the Veins of the Heart run into one trunk, called the Coronary or Cardiac Vein, which terminates in the Right Auricle. This Vein is made up of three principal branches; a Main or Posterior Branch, a Middle, and an Anterior. The Main Branch may be considered as beginning on the inferior surface of the Heart, close to the Apex, where it receives a number of small branches corresponding to the last ramifications of the Posterior Coronary Artery. It then turns up over the Apex, and follows the course of this Artery, becoming larger and larger in its progress, by the addition of new brunches from the Right and Left Ventricles. At the top of the furrow between the Ventri- cles, it turns downwards into the groove between the. Left Auricle and Ventricle, winds round in this, receiving branch- es from the Auricle and Ventricle all the way, and just before entering the Right Auricle, is joined by the Middle and Anterior Branches. The Middle Branch begins at the extremity next the Apex of the furrow between the Ventricles on the inferior

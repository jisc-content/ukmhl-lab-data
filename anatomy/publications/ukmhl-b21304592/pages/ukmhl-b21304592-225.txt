193 THE NERVES IN GENERAL. broader and more prominent; but in old Age, again begin to fade. A boy of four years, and another of eight, were the only two cases, in which the Wenzels found them want- ing, out of ninety-seven dissections. How soon the distinction between the White and Brown Nervous Matter is perceptible in the Substance of the Cord, does not seem to have been ascertained. The Brown Cen- tral Column, however, is very distinct at Birth ; and I am almost inclined to think, that it is larger proportionally, and darker in its colour at this, than at any after Period of Life. I have repeatedly observed, that in old people it had entire- ly disappeared ; its place being occupied by White Matter; and I find that Chaussier * states this to be a change, which the Cord constantly undergoes in the Decline of Life. The Wenzels j* examined the Nervous Matter of the Cord, at the Period of Birth, with the Microscope; and they say, that its globules appeared to them smaller than those of the Nervous Matter of the Brain, at the same Period. SECTION II. OF NERVES IN GENERAL. Serves may be defined to be, Cords, consisting of one or more threads or filaments of Nervous Matter, connected either directly or indirectly with the Central Mass. These Cords are of various shapes; some are flat, others - round ; some taper slightly, others exhibit irregular enlarge- ments. They vary, also, in their size; some are too small to be perceptible to the naked eye, while others are half an inch or an inch broad. â– f* De Penitior. Struct. &c. p. 294* 1 Expos. Som. p. 146.

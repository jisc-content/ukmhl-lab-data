261 SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE IN GENERAL. Its distribution throughout the Body is very extensive; but it is only to be found where parts of such hardness as Tendon, or Cartilage, or Bone, are intended to rub upon each other*. I am not aware of any material difference in the Anato- my of Synovial Membrane, corresponding either to Sex or Age. * The continuation of the Synovial Membrane over the surface of Articu- lating Cartilages, (a distribution more than hinted at by Dr. Nesbit and Dr. Hunter, and, confidently maintained by Bichat,) is, I am convinced from a number of experiments, afterwards to be detailed, when treating of the Skele- ton, altogether an Anatomical refinement. The continuation of the Tunica Conjunctiva, over the Cornea of the Eye, is, I fear, a fiction of the same kind.

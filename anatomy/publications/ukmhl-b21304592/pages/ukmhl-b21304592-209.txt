177 ITS DIVISIONS—OUTER SURFACE. doubtful, whether they are even the sixtieth part of an inch deep. I suspect, that in examining these Fissures in general, they have been made to appear deeper than they really are, from the laceration of part of the Substance of the Cord; this, however, is a point to be investigated. Just where the Top of the Cord joins the Cervical Por- tion, the Anterior Median Fissure is interrupted or crossed, by two or three ridges, varying a little in their shape and size, but seldom exceeding a twelfth of an inch in diameter, which run, with a slight obliquity downwards, from one side of the Cord to the other. These ridges would hardly have been worthy of particular notice, were it not for the absurd theories, with which they have often been connected in physiological writings. I have never observed the slightest appearance of a La- teral Furrow in the Spinal Cord, dividing each half of it into anterior and posterior portions, such as Soemmerring 4 and Portal-f*, and several Anatomists prior to them have de- scribed. I am confident, therefore, that if it ever exists, it is by no means a constant appearance. The colour of the Cervical and Dorsal Portions of the Cord, is Orange-White throughout. The upper portion of the Top of the Cord exhibits three Eminences on each side, exactly similar to each other. The first is situated close to the Anterior Median Fissure, forming one side of it. It is about half an inch long, and a quarter of an inch broad; and as its breadth is uniform throughout, without the slightest appearance of tapering, I prefer to call it the Oblong Eminence, instead of the Corpus Pyrarrudale\, which it is often denominated.

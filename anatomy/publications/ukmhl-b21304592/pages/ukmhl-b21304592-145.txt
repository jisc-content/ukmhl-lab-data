I.OWER SURFACE OF THE CEREBELLUM. 1 IS The whole surface of the Annular Protuberance is mark- ed by slender furrows, most of which lie horizontally, though sometimes towards the Trigeminal Nerve, they are a little inclined. They are of various lengths; none of them extending completely across from one side to the other. They are deepest and most numerous towards the sides of the Protuberance ; but there is scarcely the breadth of a twelfth of an inch, on any part of its surface, which is entirely without them. Besides these furrows, numerous little holes are seen upon it, as if it had been pricked with the point of a pin. Into these, small Bloodvessels enter, from the Membranes after- wards to be described. From the lower margin of this surface of the Protuberance, about a sixth of an inch on each side of the Basilar Furrow, the Abductores Oculorum Nerves take their origin. Their attachment does not exceed the fifteenth part of an inch. Immediately under the Annular Protuberance, there is a large sinuosity, of a conical shape, with the base turned upwards, which lodges the top of the Spinal Cord, and which, therefore, may be called the Spinal Fossa of the Cerebellum. The lower surface of the Annular Protuber- ance, or that which is made by cutting away the Spinal Cord, overhangs this Fossa. This surface is horizontal, and in shape somewhat like two crescents, joined by their convexities towards their anterior horns; consequently, it has a small sharp notch in the middle before, and a large and wide one in the middle behind. The greatest transverse diameter of this surface, measures about an inch ; and the largest diameter from before backwards, about five eighths of an inch. In the angle between its posterior margin and the posterior surface of the Fossa, there is a slit, about a sixth of an inch wide in the middle, but tapering to about a twelfth of an inch on each side, which leads into the Cen- tral Fissure of the Cerebellum.

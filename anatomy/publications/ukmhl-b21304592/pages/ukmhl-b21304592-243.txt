ORIGINS OF THE SPINAL NERVES. 211 the inner surface of the Sub-peduncular Lobule of the Ce- rebellum ; then it turns outwards, over the continuation of the same substance which lies on the lower and anterior sur- face of that Lobule; and after a course of about half an inch, altogether, from its Origin, it perforates the Arachnoid Membrane. It is of a round shape, is about a twentieth of an inch thick, and consists of fine Fasciculi of Nervous Filaments, with a Neurilema of Pia Mater. Origins of the Pneumo-Gastric Nerves. The Pneumo-gastric Nerve arises, on each side, from the anterior margin of the Peduncle of the Spinal Cord, imme- diately below the Origin of the Glosso-pharyngeal. It follows precisely the same course as the Glosso-pha- ryngeal Nerve, running underneath it throughout, at scarce- ly more than the distance of a hair-breadth. Just after its Origin, it rests on the Anterior Membraniform Process of the Top of the Spinal Cord ; and farther outwards, lies on the Plexus-looking substance covering the Sub-peduncular Lobule. It consists of from ten to twenty fine Fasciculi of Fila- ments, embraced as usual with Pia Mater, which form a band about an eighth of an inch broad, and perhaps a six- tieth of an inch thick ; but always a little thicker above than below, because the upper part of the band contains the strongest Fasciculi. Origins of the Hypo-Glossal Nerves. The Hypo-glossal Nerve arises, on each side, from the Fossa in the Top of the Spinal Cord, between the Oblong and the Oval Eminence, 2

CENTRAL MASS AND NERVES—BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD. 79 row. We shall call this prolongation, in future, the Spinal Cord* I aoree with Soemmer RiNGf and Bichat]:, in placing b the commencement of the Spinal Cord, at the lower margin of the Annular Protuberance. Many still continue to in- clude a portion of its upper extremity along with the Brain, under the name of Medulla Oblongata; but this arrange- ment is neither precise nor natural. OF THE BRAIN. The Brain consists of a peculiar substance, embraced by thin membranes. Its weight and volume are different in different persons; but these varieties do not seem to observe any relation to the weight or stature of the individual. In general, it weighs, when its Bloodvessels are quite empty, from two and a half, to three pounds Avoirdupois. We shall examine its Substance first, and then the Mem- branes which cover it. In order to expose the Substance of the Brain completely, the Membranes must be carefully peeled off. We have then to attend, in the first place, to its general divisions, and the appearance of its surfaces external and internal; and se- condly, to its structure. * No apology, I trust, is necessary to Anatomists for this innovation. The term Spinal Marrow seems to have continued in use, solely, because no other less objectionable happens to have been suggested. I have employed the term Spinal Cord, for several years in my Anatomical Lectures, and have reason to believe that it is pretty readily adopted by all classes of Students. • De Corp. Hum. Fab. tom.

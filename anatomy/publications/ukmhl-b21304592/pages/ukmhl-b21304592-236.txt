THE NERVES IN GENERAL. â€¢04- It runs forwards and a little inwards, lodged in a Fossa also formerly described, (p. 85.) between two Convolutions of this Lobe; closely connected to these Convolutions by the Pia Mater which forms its Neurilema, and having the Arachnoid Membrane passing across its inferior surface. Af- ter a course of about an inch and a half, it divides into a number of minute branches, which immediately perforate the Arachnoid Membrane. For about an inch from its Origin forwards, the Olfacto- ry Nerve is of a triangular shape, and nearly an eighth of an inch thick; with one side looking downwards, and the opposite angle lodged in the Fossa between the Convolu- tions already mentioned. Beyond this, however, it gradual- ly swells out into an oval or pyriform Bulb, from the lower surface of which those branches come off, which perforate the Arachnoid Membrane. This Bulb is wider at its ante- rior than its posterior extremity; its greatest transverse diameter seldom exceeds a fifth of an inch; and its length is usually about half an inch. It varies, however, a little both in its shape and dimensions. The whole of the Olfactory Nerve, from its Origin to the extremity of its Bulb, consists of one undivided cord of Nervous Matter, embraced by Pia Mater for a Neurilema. Both kinds of Nervous Matter exist in it, pretty nearly in equal quantity, and mingled together, from one end of it to the other. They alternate with each other longitudinally, so that the White Matter appears like threads, running through the Brown, from the Origin of the Nerve to its Bulb. The threads of White Matter, however, are most numerous towards the lower surface; the upper half of the Nerve consisting chiefly of a ridge of Brown Matter. In the Bulb, the filaments of White Matter expand, and the intervening spaces are filled up, and the whole surrounded with Brown Matter, of which the quantity appears to be greater here, proportionally, than in the preceding parts,

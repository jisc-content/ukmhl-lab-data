THE NERVES IN GENERAL. 214 outwards at right angles from the Cord, but at same time converge towards each other; and they perforate the Ar- achnoid Membrane close together. The posterior set of Fasciculi is very often entirely want- ing. Origins of the Cervical, Dorsal, Lumbar, and Sacral Nerves. These Nerves take their Origin, in regular succession, one below the other, and in the order in which they have now been named, from the top of the Cervical Portion of the Cord, to the very extremity of its Dorsal Portion. Each Nerve arises by two Roots or Sets of Fasciculi, one from the anterior, and the other from the posterior surface of the Cord, external to the Median Fissures. The Fasciculi of each Set arise, one above the other in a straight line, and immediately converge into one bundle; and the Anterior and Posterior Set of the same Nerve, al- ways arise from points on the opposite surfaces, correspond- ing in point of height. The two Roots of each Nerve incline outwards from their Origin, and more or less downwards; at same time they mutually approach each other; and at last perforate the Arachnoid Coat, very nearly, but not exactly, at the same point. The Serrated Membrane of the Cord runs up, in the angle between them ; and the Teeth of this Membrane project outwards to their insertion in the Dura Mater, in the interspaces between the Nerves. All the Fasciculi now described are obviously composed of Nervous Filaments, inclosed in a Neurilema of Pia Ma- ter, which is continuous with that of the Cord. Of the Cervical Nerves in Particular.â€”These arise from the Cervical Portion of the Cord, beginning at the top, and extending to the bottom of it.

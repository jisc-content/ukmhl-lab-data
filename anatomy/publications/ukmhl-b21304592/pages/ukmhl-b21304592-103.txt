SHAPE—ORIGIN^—DISTRIBUTION. 71 nal, so turgid with a milky substance after Death, that with the microscope, he could distinctly trace hundreds of them to their origins, by circular orifices, on the surfaces Of the Villi. On examining the capillary Absorbents of other parts in the same manner, after a minute injection, many of these little Vessels may be seen disappearing; but as no orifices are perceptible at the points where they vanish, we cannot be certain, that these are their origins. The distribution of the capillary Absorbents, like that of the capillary Bloodvessels, seems to vary in almost every Texture of the Body. In general, however, Anastomosis appears to be more frequent among them, than among either Arteries or Veins; and in consequence of this, their distribu- tion, upon the whole, has a greater resemblance to a net- work. Three things remarkably distinguish the distribution of the middle-sized Absorbents, from that of the corresponding parts of the Arterial and Venous System. In the first place, when two of these Vessels unite together into one, the trunk which they form, is seldom or never larger than either of them separately; secondly, then- Anastomoses with each other are continual; and thirdly, they seldom run any great way, without first dividing into branches, and then re-uniting into trunks. This kind of Anastomosis and division into branches, is very common, too, among the larger branches and the trunks of the Absorbents ; but when two of these run together in- to one, we generally find that the trunk which they form is, as in the Arteries and Veins, larger than either of them taken separately. The outer surface of an Absorbent Vessel is flocculent; the inner, smooth, like that of Bloodvessels. All the Absorbents in the Body, apparently, are provided with Valves. These are thinner than the Valves found in

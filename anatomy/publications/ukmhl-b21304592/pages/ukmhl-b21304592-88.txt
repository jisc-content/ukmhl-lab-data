ARTERIES IN GENERAL. 56 At last, however, after gradually diminishing as they divide, all the capillary Arteries are seen to terminate in one or other of two ways; they either pass distinctly into the capillary branches of Veins, or end abruptly, uncon- nected with any other Vessel. Whether in this latter case, however, the Arteries do really terminate where they seem to do, is very doubtful. Perhaps they are continued much farther, and yet are imperceptible from their minute- ness, even by the most powerful microscopes. But it is the province of Physiology, to state the various theories connected with this subject; we must confine ourselves, at present, to what is capable of demonstration. The termination, then, of Arteries in Veins is the only one admitting of being satisfactorily demonstrated. I am avrare, that some Anatomists* of very great reputation, have con- ceived, that they have seen the Arteries, in certain organs of the Body, distinctly terminating in a set of Vessels called Excreting Ducts; but although I have, at present, no doubt whatever that they do often end in this manner, I do not think that the point is sufficiently established, in the way of actual observation. An Artery viewed externally, after it has been emptied of its contents, is of a whitish colour, and has a loose, floc- culent appearance. Its inner surface, is every where per- fectly smooth, like the surface of the Ventricles of the Heart; in the larger Arterial Trunks it is yellowish; in the mid- dling Vessels, of a pinkish or flesh-colour; and in the smal- ler branches, whitish, like the outer surface. The sides of an Artery are always thinner than the sides of the Artery from which it arises; but the ratio of the thickness of the sides to the area of the Vessel, in Arteries of the same external diameter, is very different in different parts of the System. It seems to me, for example, that the * See in particular, Ruysch, Opera II, Thes. Auat. Stxt. No. ixxni-

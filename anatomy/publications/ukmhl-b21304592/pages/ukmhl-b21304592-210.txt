SUBSTANCE OF THE SPINAL COED. 178 but the lower margin of the Protuberance, projects farther forwards than it does, and consequently there is a pretty deep groove between them. Its colour is Orange-White. Exterior to the Oblong Eminences, on each side, is the Oval Eminence*, of an Orange-White colour also. The long diameter of this, is about half an inch, and its short one, about a quarter ; its elevation being nearly a tenth of an inch. It looks outwards and forwards ; and the groove between it and the lower border of the Annular Protuber- ance, is still deeper than that between this Protuberance and the Oblong Eminence. I observe, however, that there is considerable variety in the depth of this Eossa, depending on varieties in the projection of the two prominences be- tween which it lies. Behind the Oval Eminences and exterior to them, and oc- cupying the whole of the remaining part of the Cord, round to the Posterior Median Fissure, there is an Eminence, on each side, which I should be disposed to call the Peduncle of the Spinal Cord*)*. It is about half an inch long, three eighths of an inch broad, and between two and thiâ€™ee eighths of an inch high at the upper part, but falling gradually lower, towards its inferior extremity. Its posterior surface is slightly concave for a short way from the Median Fissure outwards; and this concave part, from being about four tenths of an inch wide above, gradually tapers to a point below. Consequently, when these surfaces in both Pe- duncles are joined together, they form a Triangular Fossal in the Top of the Cord, the basis of which is turned up- / . # * Synonyms. Lot.

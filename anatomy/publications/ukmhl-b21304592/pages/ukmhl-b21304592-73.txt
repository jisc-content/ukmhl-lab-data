SEROUS MEMBRANE.â€”MUSCULAR COAT. 41 + See Anatomy of Cellular Substance. Under the Serous Membrane and Adipose Substance, and extending inwards so as to form the principal part of the Septum both of the Auricles and the Ventricles, is si- tuated what is called the Muscular Coat of the Heart, upon which the thickness and strength of its sides chiefly depend. It is this Coat which, shining through the Serous Mem- brane at those parts where no Fat intervenes, gives the Heart its pinkish or purplish hue externally; and within the Cavities, the same Coat is seen still more distinctly and of a darker colour, through the delicate Inner Membrane. As its name imports, it is composed of Muscle*. The fibres are of a reddish brown colour, dryish, and with scarcely any intermixture of Cellular Substance . A very fine, but pretty dense Cellular Substance, however, connects them to the Serous Membrane externally. The thickness of this Coat at any particular part of the Heart, may be ascertained merely by examining the colour of a section of the parietes at that part; for the Muscular Texture is easily distinguished by its reddish hue. The usual thickness of the sides of the Heart has already been stated; and it will suffice for giving an idea of the thick- ness of the Muscular Coat to mention, that except where there is Adipose Substance, the whole parietes are consti- tuted of the Serous Membrane, the Muscular Coat, and an Inner Membrane just to be described; and that the Se- rous and the Inner Membrane taken together, are not so thick as a wafer. The distribution of the Muscular Fibres in the sides of the Auricles is most easily seen, by holding the sides between the eye and the light. On the right side of the Right Auricle they run chiefly from before backwards; but in the lower, and the anterior, * See Anatomy of Muscle.

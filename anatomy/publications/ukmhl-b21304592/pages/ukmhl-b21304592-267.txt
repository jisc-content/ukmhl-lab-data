SKIN IN GENERAL. 235 of the Quicksilver escape from the outer surface, in the most successful injections. There are few Regions of the Body, in which distinct branches of Nerves may not be traced, entering the internal surface of the True Skin, from the parts beneath. Many of their ramifications, on this surface, may often be display- ed by dissection; but it is difficult if not impossible to fol- low them into the outer surface. Their actual mode of ter- mination is nowhere known. With respect to the Sebaceous Follicles, all that I can dis- cover is, that they are little, smooth, cylindrical cells in the True-skin, which penetrate almost completely through to its inner surface. The Canals in the True Skin for the transmission of the 4 Hairs, are -all more or less oblique to its surfaces. The True Skin, when dried, becomes hard, elastic, yellow- ish or greenish like horn, and semitransparent. A portion of it, in this state, plunged into Oil of Turpentine, becomes perfectly transparent. Maceration of the True Skin in Cold Water, after a considerable length of time, renders it softer, looser in its texture, and at last reduces it to a kind of pulp. When plunged into Boiling Water, it instantly shrinks up to a great degree, becomes thicker, and greatly more elastic. In proportion, however, as the boiling is continued, the elas- ticity is destroyed. With respect to the Chemical Properties of this substance, all I have to remark at present is, that I have found it may be completely dissolved by long boiling in Water, and that the solution contains a large quantity of Gelatine. 1 have no doubt, however, that if submitted to the operation of the same agents, as have been employed in the analysis of the True Skins of Quadrupeds*, it would be acted upon in a similar manner. â€¢ See the Systems of Chemistry which were referred to at p. 239.

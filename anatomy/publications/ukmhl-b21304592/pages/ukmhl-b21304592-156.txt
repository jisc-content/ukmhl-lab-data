It is in favour of this supposition, that many of those parts, when torn asunder in a recent state, and with- out any chemical preparation, separate much more readily in the direction which their fibres exhibit when coagulatedj than in any other. White Nervous Matter when dried, acquires a yellow- ish, horny appearance; and thin slices of it become semi- transparent. It recovers its white colour on being plunged into water. In none of the analyses which have hitherto been made of the Nervous Matter, does the White species of it ap- pear to have been examined apart from the Brown. The chemical facts therefore, which T have now to state, must be regarded as strictly applicable, only to a mixture of the two kinds of this substance. 1. Vauq.ueli:n* found, that Nervous Matter, when dried over a water bath, was reduced in weight 80 per cent. 2. FoeRCRoy-f- ascertained, that when triturated in a mor- tar with cold water, it formed a whitish-coloured homoge- neous emulsion, which might be passed through a filter; and that heat, alcohol, or acids added to this emulsion, pro- duced coagula in it, of a substance resembling Albumen. Vauquelin has since found, that when this emulsion is left at rest, Albumen and a peculiar Fatty Matter separate from it together; and that Osmazome and a small portion of Al- bumen remain in solution in the water. 3. Vauquelin ascertained that when Neiwous Matter is repeatedly digested in alcohol, part of it is dissolved, and the remaining part assumes the form of greyish-white flocks, * Annales de Chimie, tom.

VALVES—THICKNESS—ELASTICITY. 65 are disposed in pairs, one exactly opposite the other, 'lhe degree of obstruction which they present, to the passage of a fluid from the trunk towards the brandies of the Vein, depends on their size, if they are single, and on their size and adaptation to each other, if they are double or triple; for both the Valves of a pair are not always of the same dimensions. They are very seldom so large, or so precisely adapted to each other, as to shut up the tube of the vessel completely. The number of {hem occurring either singly or in pairs, within any given extent, is very various in differ- ent Veins. They are found at all intervals, from four or five inches, to a quarter of an inch, or even less. In general they are most numerous in Veins of small size. Opposite to each Valve, the Vein swells out a little, so as to form a small sinus, of a parabolic shape. When the Ves- sel is distended, fhese sinuses form corresponding eminen- ces externally, and often give the Vein a knotted or jointed appearance. I do not know any Vein in the Body, of which the sides are thicker than a sixteenth part of an inch. In the Venous, as in the Arterial System, the sides of the branches are al- ways thinner than those of the trunks; but the thickness is not always proportional to the caliber of the Vessel, even in Veins of the same external diameter. Wintringham’s* experiments are often referred to, as proving that the sides of a Vein possess greater density than the sides of an Artery; but they do not seem to me at alL conclusive. Veins are elastic, but not so much so as Arteries. Hal-* xer+ , and Bichat|, maintain that they possess more elas- * Experimental Inquiry, &C. •f Elem. Physiol. I. p. 128. X Anal. Gener.

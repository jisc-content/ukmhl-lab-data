SUBSTANCE OF THE BltAIN. n On each side of the Median Line in this region, we ob- serve, in the first place, immediately underneath the Corpus Callosum, and separated from it only by a Fissure afterwards to be described, an oblong, convex, surface of the mass called Thalamus Opticus*. This stretches from behind, forwards, outwards, and a very little downwards, in the form of a curve, with the concavity inwards ; and it looks backwards and outwards. Its posterior extremity projects in the form of a papilla, which we may call the Posterior Tubercle of the Thalamus Opticus; while the anterior, forms a lesser prominence, varying a good deal in its shape, and denomi- nated the External Corpus Gcniculatum. The length of this surface is about an inch ; and its colour is white, like the Corpus Callosum. At the Median Line, the Posterior Tu- bercle is separated from the corresponding process of the opposite Thalamus, by the Oblong Passage just described. Except this Tubercle, there is none of this surface of the Thalamus visible, when the parts are in their natural con- nexion ; it is concealed by the inner part of the Middle Lobe, from which it is separated only by a Fissure. This part must be cut away, therefore, in order to bring it com- pletely into view. Underneath the middle of this surface, is seen a slight convexity, called the Inner Corpus Gcniculatum. The shape of this prominence is generally oval, the long diameter in- clining from within, outwards, forwards, and a little down- wards, but its dimensions vary exceedingly in different sub- jects. It is always less than the Posterior Tubercle of the Thalamus Opticus, and generally larger than the Outer Cor- pus Geniculatum. Sometimes, however, the two Corpora Geniculata are exactly equal in size, and at other times, the outer one is the largest. The surface of the inner Corpus Gcniculatum is smooth and white. It is separated, by a slight * Synonyms. Lat. Colliculus Nervi Optici. t

OUTER SURFACE—TRIANGULAR FOSSA. 179 wards, and the apex downwards, with the Posterior Median Fissure running exactly through its middle. On the surface of this Fossa, there are two things to be particularly attended to. 1. There is a narrow space, dis- tinguished by its darker colour, which diverges from the apex of the Fossa on each side, and extending upwards, tapers to a point within a fifth of an inch of the base of the Fossa. The colour of this space is Yellowish-White with a mixture of Red, sometimes Greyish-White, while the co- lour of the surrounding parts is Yellowish-White. 2. Se- veral small ridges, very gently elevated, and of an Orange- White colour, are generally seen extending, from the Pos- terior Median Fissure on each side, nearly parallel to the base of the Fossa, outwards to its lateral margin. Some- times, however, these White Ridges, are wanting on one side of the Fossa, sometimes on both ; and even when present, the observations of Prochaska* and the Wenzels-f- have abundantly established that there is the greatest variety in their number, breadth, and distribution. They vary in number from one to ten or even more ; and in point of size, from the breadth of a hair, to the twentieth of an inch. Sometimes they keep quite distinct from each other, in their progress outwards from the Median Fissure; sometimes two or more run together. Sometimes one or two of them, sometimes the whole, terminate before they reach the outer border of the Fossa. Occasionally, some of those on one side, appear to be continuous, at the Median Fissure, with those on the other. Not unfrequently, too, one of them may be seen beginning at a little distance from the Fissure, and instead of running outwards to the margin of the same side, crossing the Fissure, and joining the Ridges of the op- posite side. Some of them are much more inclined upwards * Oper. Min. Pars. I. p. 388. ■f De Penitior, &c. p. 169. 2

192 SPINAL CORD AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF LIFE. It has been said#, that in Children, its Substance reaches only as far down as the last Dorsal Vertebra; whereas in the Adult, it extends to the second Lumbar ; but it does nqf follow from this, that the Substance is proportionally longer in young than in old persons; the difference observed, may be owing to differences in the length of the Spine. According to CiiAUSsiER* * * §f-, its weight at Birth, is only the fortieth part of the weight of the Brain. The same Anatomist^ concludes, from a great numbeV of observations, that the Substance of the Cord is firmer at Birth than at any other period of Life, and that it gradually becomes softer as the individual advances in years. If this be really so, the Cord will form a very singular contrast to the Brain in this respect; but with all deference to Chaus- sier, I cannot but suspect, that there has been some fallacy in his observations. It appears very clearly, from the dissections of the Wen- 2Els§, that the White Ridges on the Triangular Fossa of the Top of the Cord do not exist before Birth. In an infant of seven months, they found them just beginning to appear, but their developement is very slow ; in point of breadth, they seem to observe no ratio to the age of the person. In a boy of five years, they found them very large and dis- tinct. According to their observations ^T, the Brown Ridge on each Peduncle of the Cord, appears at a much earlier period. They saw a sort of eminence in their place, which seemed to be their rudiments, in an Embryo of three months. In an Embryo of five months, they were large and distinct. As the individual approaches to Maturity, they seem to become * Soemmerrinc. De Corp. Hum. Fab. iv. p. 75. ■f Expos. Sommaire, p. 119. J Same Book, p. 117, 119. § De Penitior Struct, p. 320.

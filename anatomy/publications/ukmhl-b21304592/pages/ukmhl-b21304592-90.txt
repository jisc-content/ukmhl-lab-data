ยง8 ARTERIES IK GENERAL. the extremity of one of the rods to which it was attached; so that in all probability, had it not been injured by the thread which fastened it, it would have sustained a much greater weight. A transverse section of the vessel used in the first experi- ment, about three fourths of an inch long, and an eighth of an inch broad, when tied to rods of wood in the same manner, bore a weight of 5 lbs. before it broke. It gave way, however, exactly in the middle. In general, I believe, Arteries are weaker the thinner their sides; but whether according to any uniform ratio, is very doubtful. Wintrin&ham*, indeed, conceived he had established by experiment, that the trunks of Arteries were always weaker proportionally than the branches; but his experiments are not satisfactory. All the Arteries in the Body which are not smaller than the twelfth of an inch, may be distinctly seen to be com- posed of three Coats. The Inner Coat resembles exactly the Inner Membrane of the Ventricles of the Heart. It is equally thin, and per- fectly transparent and colourless; and its inner surface is smooth. No Vessels or Nerves have yet been seen in it. It may be peeled off from the Middle Coat, which it lines internally, by means of a dissecting forceps; but it is too tender to separate in large patches. It differs from the In- ner Membrane of the Ventricles in being a good deal more elastic. The Middle Coat of an Artery is the thickest; being about twice the thickness of the Outer one; and this pro- portion, it seems to me to maintain, in the smaller as well as in the larger vessels. It consists of a stratum of slender fibres laid closely to- gether, side by side, without any intermediate connecting * Experimental Inquiry.

ORIGINS OF THE SPINAL NERVES. 215 Their Anterior Hoots, take their Origin about a sixth ot an inch from the Median Fissures; their Posterior, between a sixth and an eighth of an inch. The Fasciculi composing the Anterior Roots, at the time they perforate the Arachnoid Membrane, vary in number from two to five ; those of the Posterior Roots, from three to seven. The Roots of the First, Second, and Third Cer- vical Nerves contain fewest; those of the remaining foui*, most. Varieties, however, sometimes occur in this respect, in the opposite Nerves of the same Paii\ The Fasciculi composing the Anterior Roots, are very slender at their immediate Origin ; and unite successively with each other to form larger Fasciculi. Those of the Pos- terior Roots are of the same dimensions when they arise as afterwards, and are larger than the Fasciculi of the An- terior Roots. The lower Cervical Nerves have the largest Fasciculi. There is hardly a fiftieth of an inch between one Ante- rior Root and another ; but between one Posterior Root and another there is in general, from a sixth to an eighth of an inch. Among the Posterior Roots, it is by no means un- common to find a Fasciculus of one Root sending off a branch to the Root immediately above or below. The Roots of the First Cervical Nerve incline a very little downwards, and the inclination increases regularly from the First to the Seventh. Their length too, increases with this obliquity ; the Roots of the First being about a third of an inch long, and those of the Seventh, rather more than a half. Of the Dorsal Nerves in Particular.â€”These take their Origin from the three upper fourths of the Dorsal Portion of the Cord.

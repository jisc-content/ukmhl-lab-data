SUBSTANCE OF THE BRAIN. 120 •}■ See St mi’s Notnenclaiure of Colours. anterior surface of the Vieussenian Valve, and is white, smooth, and c onvex. The two lateral parts are the anterior surfaces of the Pillars of this Valve, and are inclined a little inwards. They have the same smoothness and colour as the middle part, and are of a triangular figure. The anterior side of the Fissure, is of a browner hue than the other two, particularly towards the lower part. A narrow groove* about a twelfth of an inch deep, runs along its Median Line, beginning within the Aqueduct of Sylvius above, and continued below into the Spinal Cord, where we have afterwards to take notice of it. On each side of this furrow, the surface is slightly rounded and cord-like, and is in general a little more prominent at the lower part than above. Such are the appearances which present themselves on the various surfaces, external and internal, of the Substance of the Brain. We have next to consider the structure and composition of this substance. It consists almost entirely of a peculiar matter, which we shall call Nervous Matter. Of this there are two sorts, one usually denominated Medullary, the other Cineritious. It is better, however, to distinguish them by the terms White and Brown Nervous Matter. We shall consider of each of these separately. The White Nervous Matter is of different shades, in dif- ferent parts of the Brain. In most parts, it resembles in colour, a mixture of Orange-White and Wine-Yellow t; and this sort, we shall call, Orange-White. In other parts, it approaches more closely to the Wine-Yellow; and this species may be distinguished by the term Yellowish-White. • Synonym. Fr. Silloii Longitudinal et Moyendu Ventricule du Cervelet.

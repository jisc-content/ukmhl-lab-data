THEIP. SUBSTANCE AND CAPSULE. 77 Vessels are brought into view; and it will be found, that they have precisely the same distribution, as those already described on the surface. Sometimes the Absorbent Vessels of a Gland, preserve a pretty uniform diameter through,opt, so that there is little or no appearance of cells in any part of it. Within the Glands, the Absorbent Vessels seem to have the same structure as elsewhere. By means of a proper injection of Size and Vermilion, small Bloodvessels may be traced into the substance of the Glands, following the convolutions of the Absorbent Vessels every where, and forming an intimate net-work round each of the cells. No Nerves have yet been demonstrated accompanying either of these sets of Vessels. The only other substance detected within the Glands, be- sides these Vessels, is a delicate sort of Cellular Substance, which unites the Vessels together. The Capsule of Absorbent Glands, inclosing the Internal Substance, is a thin, pellucid, and colourless Membrane. Maceration resolves it into a number of fine, whitish, fibres. It is very vascular ; and Mascagni seems to have injected Absorbents in it. Its nerves have not been traced. It is connected to the parts within, by a fine Cellular Substance. I know of no difference betwixt the Absorbent Glands of the Female and those of the Male, In young persons the Glands are in general rounder and more turgid. Haller* and various Anatomists before and since his timef, have described a fluid of the colour and consistence of milk, as existing in the cells of the fine * Elem. Physiol.

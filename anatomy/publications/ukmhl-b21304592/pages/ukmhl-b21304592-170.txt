SUBSTANCE OF THE BRAIN. 138 The Inner one incloses a similar nucleus, but it is consi- derably smaller and paler in colour. Closely connected with the inferior surface of the White stratum, which is prolonged from the Peduncles of the Brain Proper on each side (see p. 132), there is a mass of a sub- stance, apparently composed of plates and fibres of Orange- White and Greyish-Brown Nervous Matter, intimately in- termixed and closely compacted together. This mass ex- tends, from opposite the posterior margin of the Peduncles behind, to the Anterior Commissure of the Brain before. The Tractus Opticus runs along its inferior surface, towards the Median Plane, and external to this, it is only separated from the Anterior Lateral Part of the Central Fissure, by a layer of Orange-White Matter, about a fortieth part of an inch in thickness. The laminae and filaments of Orange- White Matter which are found in this mass, have all a di- rection upwards and outwards, some on the forepart inclin- ing at the same time forwards, and others behind running backwards. Neither its anterior nor its posterior extremity, however, seems to contain any White Matter, but to consist of Nervous Matter, intermediate in colour between Wood- Brown and Yellowish-White. Its outer and upper surface too, which forms an arch convex outwards, is lined with a layer about a fortieth of an inch thick, of the same sort of Matter ; and corresponding in curvature and thickness ex- actly with this layer, but situated about a sixth of an inch farther inwards, there is another arched stratum of the same kind. In a transverse section of this part of the Brain, the cut edges of these two layers, have the appear- ance of concentric curved lines of a white colour. From the outer and upper surface of the mass just de- scribed, innumerable fine laminae and fibres of Orange- White Matter, diverge into the Greyish-Brown Substance of that part of the Corpus Striatum, which lies under the

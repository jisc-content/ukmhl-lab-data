38 CAPACITIES OF THE CAVITIES OF THE HEART. springs. It is placed immediately underneath the Upper Angle of the Right Ventricle. In the Heart, as we usually find it after Death, the Cavi- ties of the Ventricles are always larger than tliose of the Auricles. The Cavities, also, of the Right Side, in general, appear to the eye larger than the corresponding Cavities on the Left; though in a much less degree in some cases than in others. In some instances they seem pretty nearly alike. None of the experiments which have hitherto been made*, with a view to measure the capacity of these Cavities in the state in which they are found after Death, are perfectly sa- tisfactory. In some, we are uncertain, whether precautions were taken to prevent the fluid employed in the measure- ment, from escaping by some of the Bloodvessels communi- cating with the cavities; in others, it is doubtful whether the Coagula which often form in these cavities after death, and greatly diminish their capacity, had been carefully remov- ed ; in others again, the fluid employed was calculated to extend the parietes of the cavities too much by its weight. In several experiments in which these precautions were at- tended to, I> found that the Right Ventricle contained oz. of Water, while the Left contained only 2 oz ; but further trials are necessary relative to this point. The posterior surface of the Right Auricle, and the an- terior surface of the Left, are formed by the opposite sides of a common Septum. This Septum towards its edge is more than an eighth of an inch in thickness; but it becomes gradually thinner to- wards the part corresponding to the Oval Fossa, where it is seldom thicker ihan a wafer. The insertion of the other sides of the Auricles into the margin of this Septum, gives rise to that furrow seen ex- * See Sbnac, Traite, &c. I. 189. Haller, Elem. Phys. I. 323-7.

BONE IN GENERAL. 253 The Sulphuric, Nitric, Muriatic, and Acetic Acids, when properly diluted, all soften Bone and render it pliable, with- out its being possible to discover, by the most minute in- spection, that a single particle of its substance has been re- moved. I have repeated this experiment many times ; and on some of the most delicate portions of Osseous Substance in the Body. The form and size of the slenderest fibre re- mains unaltered by the process. I find Muriatic Acid to be tbe menstruum best adapted for the purpose. In pro- portion as the piece of Bone becomes soft by this operation, it loses its yellowish colour, and becomes bluish or grey; approaching somewhat in appearance to Cartilage. The very opposite effects are produced on Osseous Sub- stance by exposing it to a strong Heat. If a bit of Bone be burnt in a charcoal fire, of which the heat has been gra- dually raised to whiteness, and it be then carefully remov- ed and cooled very slowly, it will be found to have become exceedingly brittle, and of a pure white colour. Still, not a particle of the Substance will appear to have been de- stroyed. If the process have been carefully conducted, it will have precisely the same shape and dimensions as be- fore. There is no Texture in the Body, of which the Chemical Properties have been more frequently or more minutely in- vestigated than Bone. The following are the more import- ant facts relative to this subject, 1. If a piece of recent Bone, be taken from a part of the Skeleton, where it is least exposed to any foreign admixture of Oily or Gelatinous matters, and after being well washed, be rasped down, and boiled in Water for some time, it will yield to the Water a considerable quantity of Gelatine*. â€¢ It is an extremely common opinion, that a considerable quantity of Fat also is extracted from Osseous Substance by this process. I am convinced, however, from many experiments, that this is a mistake. There is no Oily

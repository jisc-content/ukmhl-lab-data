171 ACCORDING TO AGE- maximum ; and during the remainder of Life, these dimen- sions neither increase nor diminish*. The Wenzels have given, also, a minute detail of the average dimensions of each particular part of the Brain, at various periods, from the third month after Conception, till the eightieth year -f*. The length of this description, how- ever, will hardly permit me, on the present occasion, to do more than refer to it. The Convolutions of the Brain Proper, begin to be form- ed, only about the third month after Conception. At this period, they are mere superficial depressions and prominen- ces. They appear first on the Middle and Posterior Lobes, and extend to the Anterior. At the fifth month, they are still indistinct; but at the seventh, they are strong and well marked. After this, they become gradually larger, in pro- portion to the age of the Foetus and of the Child j. There is no Acervulus on the Pineal Gland, before Birth. A soft, glutinous, substance, which may perhaps be regarded as its rudiments, sometimes appears in its place before the seventh year; but a perfect Acervulus is never found un- til this period. From the seventh to the sixtieth year, the number of grains in the Acervulus seems to increase; and after this, rather to diminish § . The Laminae of the Cerebellum are developed a good deal earlier than the Convolutions of the Brain Proper. In an Embryo of five months, they are very distinct and regu- lar, and separated by deep fissures ||. The general result of their investigations is, that some parts of the Brain increase most in size before Birth, others between Birth and the seventh year ; but that all parts of ■ De Penitior. &c. p. 323, 253, 254. •j- Same book, p. 249.

130 SUBSTANCE OF THE BRAIN. The surface of the Hippocampus in eacli Hemisphere, is formed of a layer of Orange-White Matter about a twen- tieth of an inch thick. This layer is continuous on the inside, with the rJ acnia Hippocampi, which is also composed entire- ly of Orange-W hite Matter; and both are connected above, with the Substance of the Fornix and Corpus Callosum. Under it, is a stratum a little thicker, of Greyish-Brown Matter, which beginning at the Indented Band, extends at first outwards, and then turning downwards and inwards, is continued into the Brown coating of the innermost Con- volution of the Middle Lobe. In the doubling of this last stratum, again, another layer of Orange-White Matter, thin- ner even than the first, is situated; and this may be traced, beyond the Indented Band, over the outer surface of the Brown coating of the Convolution just mentioned, where it gradually becomes thinner and darker in colour, and disap- pears. The Colliculus, in the Posterior Lateral Part of the Cen- tral Fissure, is composed entirely of Orange-White Nervous Matter. The Septum Lucidum, consists of a thin lamina of OrangoWhite Matter, lined on each side, opposite the most convex part of the Corpora Striata, with a thin stratum of Greyish-Brown Matter. The White middle stratum, is in general split into two layers towards the upper and fore- part, by a cavity or slit, close at all points, about a quarter of an inch in length, somewhat of a triangular shape, and placed exactly in the Median Plane. This cavity has been called, the Sinus of the Septum Lucidum*. What width it has in the natural state of the Brain, has not been ascer- tained ; but in most instances, it is found to contain a small quantity of a watery fluid. From the lower edge of the Septum Lucidum, a band of Orange-White Matter extends downwards, on the inner sur- * Synonym. Lat. Fossa Sylvii.

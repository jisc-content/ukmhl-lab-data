247 HAIR IN GENERAL. ated Hydrogen Gas was evolved, which acted strongly on the sides of the Copper vessel, turning them black ; but the quantity of the Gas was greater, the higher the temperature. When the Hair employed was black, or the Heat was not sufficiently great to decompose it, a Black Matter remained, which fell down very slowly, in consequence of its minute division and the consistence of the solution. This Matter was found to be composed chiefly of a Black Oil, as thick as Bitumen, soluble in a slight degree, either in Alcohol or Alkalis, and of Iron and Sulphur, perhaps united together. A Yellowish-Reel Matter was left by Red Hair, in which was found a great deal of Oil, Sulphur, and a little Iron. The Watery solution of Hair, when filtered, has scarcely any colour. Concentrated Acids render it turbid ; but an excess of these agents restores its transparency ; and weak Acids produce no change on it. The Infusion of Galls, and Oxygenated Muriatic Acid, form in it copious precipi- tates. Silver is blackened in it; and the Acetate of Lead is precipitated brown. The Solution, carefully evaporated, did not assume the consistence of Jelly on cooling, but re- mained glutinous 3. Vauquelin also found, that Hair, might be dissolv- ed in Water containing merely 4 per cent, of Caustic Pot- ash. During this solution, Hydrosulphuret of Ammonia was evolved. Black Hair left a black residuum, composed of a thick Oil, with Iron and Sulphur; and Red Hair, a Yellow Oil, with very small quantities of the same ingredi- ents. In this Alkaline Solution of Hair, Acids form white precipitates, soluble in an excess of the Acids; and when these precipitates are thus redissolved, at the expiration of a certain time, an Oil appears on the surface, in the form of a pellicle with prismatic colours. The same Solution pre- cipitates Lead of a Black hue. 4. The same Chemist ascertained, that each of the Acids, acted in a particular manner on Hair. The Sulphuric and

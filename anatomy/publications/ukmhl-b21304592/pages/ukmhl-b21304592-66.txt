34 INNER SURFACE OF THE RIGHT VENTRICLE. is folded back on the posterior surface; and the Inferior, which is the smallest, lies on the lower side of the Ventri- cle. The free margin of the Valve, however, does not float loose within the cavity of the Ventricle. A number of small white, tough threads, called Tendinous Cords, arising, some from the projecting extremities, and others from the sides, of certain of the Fleshy Columns, branch off in every direc- tion into smaller threads, which again ramify in various ways, and go at last to be inserted into the edge of the Valve along its whole extent; so that it looks as if it were fringed with a sort of net-work. Several of the threads, however, are often found inserted into the outer surface of the Valve instead of the margin. The lower edge of the Anterior Flap, and the anterior edge of the Lower one, are in general attached to three or four Tendinous Cords, which arise from those Fleshy Co- lumns, that spring from the anterior side of the Ventricle. Three or four Tendinous Cords, arising from the Columns which project from the lower side of the Ventricle, send off the little threads which are inserted into the posterior edge of the Lower Flap, and the lower edge of the Posterior one. The threads which are attached to the upper margins of the Anterior and Posterior Flaps, are all derived from five or six Tendinous Cords, which arise from the sides of some of the superficial ridges or small fleshy papillae, that are to be found immediately below the smooth surface leading to the Upper Angle of the Ventricle. But besides these Tendinous Cords, the extremities of some Fleshy Columns are often found directly inserted into the outer surface of the Valve, towards its root. It is generally the Lower and Anterior Flaps of the Valve which have these connections. In consequence of the shortness of the Tendinous Cords, the Valve, even when the Ventricle is only moderately

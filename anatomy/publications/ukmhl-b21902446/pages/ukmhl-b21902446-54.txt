Frozen Sections of a Child. 34 upper part is nearer the spine than the lower. It is entirely under cover of the ribs. Luschka describes it as following the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs, a description that would apply very tolerably to this case. The great peculiarity of the spleen in this instance is its relation to the peritoneum. Usually it is entirely covered, except near the hylus, with a prolongation from the lining of the great peri- toneal cavity, though it is stated that at least in the young subject a portion of the lower and posterior surface derives its covering from the lesser cavity. Here, however, a large part of the organ is with- out any serous covering. The anterior layer of the gastro-splenic omentum may be seen in Plate VIII., running backward from the outer surface of the stomach to the inner one of the spleen, but the posterior layer does not exist, because the fold of peritoneum, which ought to be carried around the back of the spleen to form it, is seen stopping short between that organ and the kidney.

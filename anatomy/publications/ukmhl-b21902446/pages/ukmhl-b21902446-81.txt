Frozen Sections of a Child. 51 the omentum is still in front, and the remainder of the space is filled by folds of small intestine, which are distended on the left and con- tracted on the right. The psoas makes a bold projection on either side of the vertebra. Nerves of the lumbar plexus are seen within it. A considerable amount of fat lies between the psoas and iliacus be- hind the peritoneum. The aorta has divided in the thickness of the slice above this plate, presumably at about the normal position oppo- site the middle of the fourth lumbar vertebra. It is much more likely to divide below than above this point. The common iliac artery and vein are seen on the right, while on the left, at a somewhat lower level, the external and internal iliac arteries lie, just after their origin, in front of the common iliac vein, which is running very obliquely at this point. The iliac arteries usually divide near the lower border of the last lumbar vertebra. The right one is usually the longer. Their relations to veins differ materially. At their lower ends each has the vein at its inner side, but the left vein inclines to the right, as does also the right one, which gets behind its artery, and the two unite to form the vena cava behind the right iliac at a point below the bifurcation of the aorta. Nothing has been said of the ureters, which, indeed, call for little comment till they reach the bladder. They descend along the psoas behind the peritoneum. In this plate they are still on the outside of the iliac vessels, which they usually cross near the division of the common iliacs. In Plate XIII. they pass near the outer angles of the promontory of the sacrum. It is not uncommon for the ureter to be double at its origin, but the two roots almost always unite before opening into the bladder.

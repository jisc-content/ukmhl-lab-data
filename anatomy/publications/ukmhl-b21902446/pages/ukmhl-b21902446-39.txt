PLATE V. HIS represents a pretty even section, 1.8 ctm. below the pre- ceding one. Three vertebrae are shown. The body of the seventh dorsal is cut about the middle. The arch belongs to the same vertebra, but the articular processes of the eighth appear be- fore it; and behind is the tip of the spinous process of the sixth. The dorsal region forms 47.6 per cent, of the spine above the sacrum, and keeps very nearly the same relative length in the embryo and throughout life. Its mean length in the adult is 28.5 ctm. The intervertebral discs constitute a little more than a quarter—26.4 per cent.—of the dorsal region. The eighth rib is just below the plane of the section on the left, and still deeper on the right. The third rib is shown on the right just where it joins its cartilage. The latter rises very rapidly as it approaches the sternum. This bone is cut where the fourth cartilages join it between its third and fourth pieces. The scapulae end just above this plane. The differences between the relations of the antero-posterior and the transverse diameters of the thorax of the child and of the adult are much more marked at about this level than at the highest part of the cavity. Thus, in this plate, the former diameter is to the latter about as 1 to 2, while in the adult it varies from as 1 to 2.5 to as 1 to 3. At birth it is nearly as 2 to 3. The nipple is on the front wall of this slice opposite the fourth rib on both sides. Luschka found it in the fourth intercostal space forty-four times out of sixty in males. In women it is said to be op- posite the fifth rib; but, owing to the great variety of forms and sizes of the breast, it is of no constant value as a landmark in women. This cut is a remarkably fortunate one, for it has struck the heart so as to open its four cavities, and to show both the valves of the left ventricle. Three-fourths of the heart, as seen in this plate, belong

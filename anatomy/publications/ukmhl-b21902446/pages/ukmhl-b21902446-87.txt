Frozen Sections of a Child. 55 It must be remembered that the whole descending colon may be so covered, and there seems no reason for having the change of name precede the change of direction. The sigmoid flexure in this case forms a very respectable “ S,” ending opposite the left sacro-iliac syn- chondrosis, where the rectum begins. This flexure is attached to a pretty long mesentery that allows it to move very freely. Its posi- tion varies not only with the degree of its distention, but with that also of the bladder and of the other folds of intestine. It may be found in the right iliac fossa. In new-born children it very frequently extends into the right inguinal region ; indeed, it is always there at that age according to some authorities. The ovaries are seen in this plate occupying very different posi- tions from those they assume later. The right one is situated at the margin of the true pelvis opposite the outer part of the promontory. The left one is much farther forward, opposite the external iliac ves- sels and entirely above the true pelvis, for this section strikes its lower end. They are both placed with the end nearest the uterus below, and with their flat surfaces looking sideways. They are cov- ered by a fold of peritoneum. The ovaries, in fact, are descending into the pelvis in a manner perfectly analogous to the descent of the testes, only in a different direction. In the adult the ovaries are in the true pelvis. It is very doubtful if they are always in the same position. The right external iliac artery appears much larger than the left, which is probably due to the injection having been made from the right femoral. The branches of the internal iliac vessels are much behind them, making their way downward to the back of the pelvis. The gluteal muscles are well shown, but require no special comment.

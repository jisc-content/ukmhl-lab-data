PLATE VIII. THIS section, on an average 2 ctm. below the last, is unfortunately uneven from side to side. The left side is perhaps as much as 5 mm. below the right. The column is divided at the disc below the eleventh dorsal. The ribs are not very unsymmetrical, but the carti- lage of the seventh is divided at its lowest part on the left, while on the right it passes below the section. We do not see the head of a rib opposite the intervertebral cartilage, as the eleventh and twelfth ribs arise from their respective vertebrae. The tenth usually arises from the tenth vertebra and a part of the cartilage above it, without reaching the ninth. The liver fills a much larger part of the abdomen than in the adult, though proportionally smaller than in the foetus. The greatest transverse diameter is shown in Plate VII., but that is not so great as is sometimes considered normal for the adult. The great increase of size is due to the depth. It almost reaches the level of Plate VI., from which it is separated only by the diaphragm, and it extends downward below Plate X. to the third lumbar vertebra. The out- line of the anterior edge can be readily deduced from the plates. It rises gradually to Plate IX., and then more rapidly. The liver of a healthy adult lying on his back should not descend below the border of the ribs, except in the region of the ensiform cartilage. It is evi- dent that in this case the liver considerably exceeds these limits. This is not the result of disease, but a characteristic of the age of the child. The liver is usually described as having an upper and a lower surface, an anterior border, which is thin, and a posterior one, which is thick, especially on the right. The lobe of Spigelius is marked off on the under surface by the fissure of the vena cava on the right, the transverse one in front, and that of the obliterated ductus venosus on the left. How the inferior cava comes to be lying along the under sur-

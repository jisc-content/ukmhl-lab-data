9 Frozen Sections of a Child. are very powerful muscles, and their chief work probably is to hold the head and neck firm. The trapezii and the sterno-mastoids are both inclosed in the cervical fascia, which extends from the ligamen- tum nuchae to the median line, and splits to receive them. From the deep surface of this fascia, in the anterior region, there pass off a number of layers, making sheaths for the smaller muscles, joining the capsule of the thyroid and the sheaths of the great vessels. The sheath'of the carotid must not be considered as a membranous tube, but rather as a collection of dense areolar tissue surrounding the ar- tery, vein, and nerve, and running in between them. The vein is seen at the outside of the artery, and the nerve behind; on the left, between them. The small size of the vein compared to that of the artery is due to the latter being injected and the former empty. The omo-hyoid lies at this level on the outside of the vessels. The pre- vertebral fascia, binding down the longi colli, and passing over the scaleni, is a very distinct structure. The levator anguli scapulae lies behind the scalenus medius, beneath the fat at the side of the neck. It slightly overlaps the splenius. In rotary motions of the head each splenius may act with the sterno-mastoid of the opposite side. It is very likely, however, that slight rotary motions are made chiefly by the group of small muscles below the occiput. The external jugular veins are seen at the rear edge of the ster- no-mastoids, outside of the fascia. The anterior jugular is normally outside of the fascia : it may be single or double. It opens into the subclavian vein, or, especially in the latter case, may be connected with both by a transverse vein just above the sternum. The deep plexus of veins in front of the trachea, somewhat below this level, comes from the thyroid body, and empties into the left innominate vein.

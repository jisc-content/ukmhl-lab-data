PLATE II. THIS plane is nearly level antero-posteriorly, though perhaps the front is still a little the lower, its distance below the preceding plate being about 2 ctm. We see the lower part of the first dorsal vertebra, and, apparently behind it, owing to the curve of the spine, a part of the intervertebral disc. The arch and pedicles belong to the second dorsal. By remembering that two ribs rest, in part at least, against the first dorsal, we know that till we approach the lower end of the dorsal region the head of each rib touches the upper border of the corresponding dorsal vertebra. Thus we see the beginning of the second rib on both sides at its origin, and the first rib cut obliquely as it descends to the sternum. The relations may fairly be called normal, even for the adult, as there is a great deal of variation in the height of the top of the sternum and in the consequent inclination of the plane of the top of the thorax. In this case the upper end of the sternum is opposite the lower part of the second dorsal vertebra. This is, perhaps, higher than usual. The lungs are seen rising above the clavicles; the left one ap- pears the larger, although the section is a little higher on that side. They reach to about the level of the head of the first rib. Usually there is little difference in the height of the apices which lie far back in the cage formed for them by the upper ribs. The general course of the first rib to the sternum, from the point at which it is di- vided, can easily be imagined. The pleura extends obliquely forward to the margin of the rib beneath the structures which appear between the lungs and the clavicles. The scaleni antici1 are important land- marks. They reach the first rib a little below this section. The 1 They are not named in the plate, but are to be seen on each side between the two lines that converge from different parts of the subclavian artery.

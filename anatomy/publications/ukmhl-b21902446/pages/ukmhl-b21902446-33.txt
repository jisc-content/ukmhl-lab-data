PLATE IV. THIS is about 1.8 ctm. below the preceding surface, and slightly nearer to it in front than behind. It is, however, practically horizontal, and falls just below the axillae. The apex of the spine of the fifth dorsal appears on a level with the lower part of the body of that vertebra. The second piece of the sternum is divided just above the third cartilage. The cartilage of the second rib just touches this plane, showing that in this instance, at least, it describes a curve, though a slight one. This plate and its two neighbors show admirably the relations of the great vessels and of the roots of the lungs. The pleurae nearly meet behind the sternum, where they overlap the thymus. The peri- cardium is opened widely above the auricles. It is folded in between the aorta and the vena cava, follows the former till it begins to turn backward, and passes round the front and side of the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery and the aorta are twisted round one an- other. The former arises not quite in front of the latter, as is some- times taught, but a little more to the left, behind the left border of the sternum at the lower edge of the third cartilage. The auricular appendages hang on either side of it. One of its valves is behind, two in front. The vessel runs upward, backward, and slightly to the left, dividing beneath the aortic arch opposite the junction of the car- tilage of the second rib to the sternum. The right division is seen in this plate, the left is higher. The aorta arises lower, the central point of its lumen at its origin being a little above the plane of Plate V., behind the sternum, on a level with the upper border of the fourth cartilage. This is a very little lower than it is usually placed, namely, opposite the third intercostal space, or even the third cartilages. The aortic valves have been described in various ways. There are two behind and one in front. The right one of the former and the

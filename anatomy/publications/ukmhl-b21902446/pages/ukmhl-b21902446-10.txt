iv Preface. advantages, which speak for themselves, but will mention some of their shortcomings. One would expect that they would be very well suited for the study of fasciae; and so they are if you destroy the specimen by removing the tissues between the fasciae. Otherwise you see little or nothing of them, for few fasciae are thick enough to be easily distinguished when seen in section. Small vessels that have not been injected—the thoracic duct, for instance, and nerves that are cut across—are often made out only with great difficulty. I feel it my duty to admit that there is serious doubt whether in all the plates the pneumogastrics and the thoracic duct are placed quite accurately in the posterior mediastinum. My experience with frozen sections enables me to offer the fol- lowing directions for making them. First, be very sure that the body, or part, to be frozen is in precisely the position you desire, and that there are no folds or indentations in the skin. I always use natural cold when possible. Weather much above zero (Fahrenheit) is un- satisfactory ; but if the part is thoroughly chilled by several days’ ex- posure to a pretty low temperature, a night of io° may possibly finish it. Salt and ice, or snow, no doubt, will answer the purpose, but much time and patience are required. It is essential that the melted ice should have a chance to run off. The body should be frozen like a rock—so much so that the operator cannot tell whether he is cut- ting bone or muscle. Tooth is the only tissue he should be able to recognize. The sections should be made in a cold room, with a very sharp saw that has been chilled. When a section is cut, its surface is obscured by a thick half-frozen saw-dust, which is doubly thick if the freezing is not quite sufficient. It is wisest, if time allows, to remove this at once, which is done by pouring a little hot water

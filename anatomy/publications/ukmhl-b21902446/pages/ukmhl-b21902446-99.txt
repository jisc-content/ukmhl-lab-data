Frozen Sections of a Child. 63 fibres to the capsule, which is thus drawn out of the way by the same muscle that flexes the thigh. A bursa is placed on the anterior sur- face of the capsule, which sometimes opens into the joint. Pus from a psoas abscess can in this way enter its cavity. The views of the muscles are very nearly the same on both sides, the chief difference being that much more of the vastus externus is seen on the left. The gluteus maximus and the tensor vaginae femoris are seen inserted into the fascia lata, a part of which passes uninterruptedly from the crest of the ilium to the tibia. The rectus lies beside the tensor, and the sartorius is seen in front. On the left leg the last overlaps the femoral vessels, which lie on the pectineus, the adductor longus being between the latter and the median line. The obturator externus can be easily identified on both sides by its relation to the obturator membrane. Behind it is seen the quadratus femoris, running from the tuberosity of the ischium to the femur. The great sciatic nerve lies between the quadratus and the gluteus maximus in the space between the tuber- osity and the trochanter. The remainder of the muscular mass be- tween the pelvis and femur belongs to the adductor group, but as often happens, the divisions are so irregular that the individual mus- cles cannot be certainly distinguished. The femoral vessels are named on the right side and require no comment. On the left the section passes below the origin of the profunda, and consequently the relations are less simple. The femoral vein has already passed behind the artery. The profunda artery and vein are situated on their outer side. The external circumflex artery is seen winding round the femur between the iliacus and the rectus.

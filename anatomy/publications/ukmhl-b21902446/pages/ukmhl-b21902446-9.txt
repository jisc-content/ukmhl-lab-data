PREFACE. HE sections that form the basis of this little work were made, with many others, during the winter of 1880-81, to illustrate my lectures at the Harvard Medical School. The sections were so in- structive, and the series so perfect, that I was very anxious to have them drawn and published. The subject was the body of a girl, said to be three years old. The length was thirty-three inches. At this age the proportions of the body, and of the organs, are no longer those of the infant, and not yet those of the adult. The anatomy of this age has received little attention, and I hope that this work may therefore be of use. It will serve, also, for the study of the adult relations, as the peculiarities due to the age of the subject are care- fully noticed in the text. I have endeavored to call attention to the most important inferences to be drawn from the plates, and have mentioned, incidentally, many points of anatomy which the student will not find in the text-books. The reader is urged, however, to study the plates carefully for himself. They are of life-size, and drawn from the sections with great care and patience. The arteries were injected. Believing, as I do, that frozen sections will play an important part in the anatomical teaching of the future, I shall say nothing of their

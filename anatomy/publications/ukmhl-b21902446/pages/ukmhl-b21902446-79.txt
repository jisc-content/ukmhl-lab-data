PLATE XII. 7 THIS section, about 2.4 ctm. below the last, is not quite even, the right side being the higher. Though the difference is slight, it is sufficient to occasion considerable discrepancy between the lateral halves which otherwise would be nearly symmetrical. The right ilium, of course, seems not only shorter, but more cartilaginous than the other. The fifth lumbar vertebra shows an asymmetry that is really only apparent, for on the left it is struck at its prominent lower bor- der, and on the right in the concavity which its surface presents. The articular process of the sacrum appears on the left, but not on the right. The fifth lumbar is shown enclosed by the ilia, which project above it and behind all of it except the spinous process. The ilio- lumbar ligament, running from the transverse process of the last lum- bar to the crest of the ilium, is above this section, but strong bands of fibres, running more or less obliquely between different points of the vertebral column and the ilium, are seen on both sides. It is well to remember that the spine of the fourth lumbar vertebra is on a level with the highest point of the crest of the ilium. Having reached the lower end of the movable portion of the spinal column something may be said of its curves, and. first of those in the adult. There is no absolute standard; all people do not have the same curve. Apart from the peculiarities of the figure of each individual, the curve is modified by the profession, the age, various diseases, by fatigue, and by position. Mr. Wood1 gives a rule which, though it is not confirmed by my observations, is, no doubt, approxi- mately correct, and is certainly simple: it is that a line from the cen- tre of the body of the axis to that of the last lumbar vertebra at its articulation with the sacrum passes through the body of the first dor- 1 Topographical Relations of Arch of Aorta, etc. Journal of Anatomy and Physiology.

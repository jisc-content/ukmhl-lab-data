6o Frozen Sections of a Child. the left the top of the great trochanter appears. Its position shows that the leg had rolled outward as the body lay on its back to be frozen. The pyriformis, in two parts, is seen on the right. The great sciatic nerve, which leaves the pelvis below it, appears in front of it. On the left, where the plane is lower, this nerve has already made its way out- ward, so as to lie behind the ischium. The lower branch of the great or superior gluteal nerve is seen on both sides. The main trunk leaves the pelvis above the pyriformis; it then divides into two branches, of which the lower maybe seen more distinctly on the right side tending toward the space between the gluteus medius and minimus. The right hip-joint is opened so high up that but a very small piece is taken from the head of the femur. Curiously enough, this plate shows the three centres of ossification of the acetabulum; that of the ilium, which is the highest on the right, those of the pubes and ischium on the left. The socket is not thoroughly solidified till the seventeenth or eighteenth year.

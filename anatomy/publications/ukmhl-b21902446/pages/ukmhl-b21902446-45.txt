PLATE VI. THIS is 1.8 ctm. below the preceding. The cut runs, perhaps, a little obliquely, so as to strike the front wall of the chest a little higher than it should. There, however, is no serious error in assum- ing that the section is a true one. We are struck at once with a peculiarity depending on the age of the subject. The disc between the eighth and ninth dorsal vertebrae appears on a level with the be- ginning of the ensiform cartilage, which is seen just behind the carti- lages of the seventh ribs, which are about to meet. In the adult of either sex the sternal end of the seventh pair of ribs would be found opposite a lower point. Luschka places them opposite the vertebral end of the eleventh pair. A horizontal section by Braune, through the upper part of the ninth dorsal vertebrae, strikes the sternum at the sixth intercostal space. A comparison with other sections leads to the belief that the latter is a more usual relation than Luschka’s. The relations of the sternum in this child correspond remarkably with those of the adult till we reach the lower part of the body of the ster- num, which is smaller than it should be, so that the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs are crowded together at their sternal ends. The sternum varies extremely in length and in the relative size of its parts. Tillaux states that it increases with the height of the body, but that many exceptions occur—both of which statements agree with my observations. Hyrtl states very certainly that “the manu- brium of the female sternum exceeds half the length of the body, while the body of the male sternum is at least twice as long as the manu- brium.” I found that this did not apply to the breastbones of twelve men out of thirty, nor to those of fourteen out of twenty-six women. The male sternum is usually decidedly larger than the female. The above-mentioned measurements give a mean of 5.18 ctm. for the male manubrium, and of 4.67 ctm. for the female ; of 10.59 ctm. for the body

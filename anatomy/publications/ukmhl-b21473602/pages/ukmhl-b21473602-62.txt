58 The brain is enveloped in membrane, and enclosed in a proper cavity. The cerebrum is composed of two lobes, smooth and with- out convolutions, having a hollow in each, answering to the lateral ventricles. The cerebellum is as large, and sometimes larger than the cerebrum ; it is single, not having any lobes or division, and is usually cordi- form. The nervous system is very large in com- parison with the bulk of the brain, and we can distinguish separate nerves from the brain and from the spinal cord; also a grand sympathetic is found extending through the body, and supplying the viscera. The nerves from the brain are principally passing to the different senses, which these animals pos- sess in a much more perfect state than in any before described; but others also exist. They generally have nine pairs of nerves. 1. The optic to the eye. 2. The olfactory to

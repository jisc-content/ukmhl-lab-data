64 figure, size, and mobility are also extremely various. The heart is now found with four cavities, as in man; namely, two auricles, and two ven- tricles ; and the circulation is performed in the same order. The lungs communicate with the cavities of the body, and with the inte- rior or hollow part of the bones, which can be inflated by the animal at will; by which arrangement the capability of flight is no doubt facilitated. The larynx is of complex formation, and the organs of voice are more devoloped; so that some of these animals are capable of producing sounds as various as they are beautiful. No urinary bladder is found; but the uretus terminate in the rectum, and the or- gans of generation are modified and adapted to the formation and habits of the animal.

branches are passing to the various parts of the body. The organs of respiration, which appear with the vascular system, increase towards perfection as the latter becomes more perfect; pouches are added to the respiratory tubes, forming the first rudi- ments of lungs; the air is also allowed to pass to any part of the body by minute ramifications from the exterior tubes. For as there is not yet any decided circulation of the blood, it cannot be otherwise exposed to the influence of the atmospheric air. The nervous system is developed in the same proportion as the others; an appear- ance of brain is first discovered as a nervous mass, situated near the oesophagus, and from this, two principal cords pass through- out the whole length of the animal, and send off minute ramifications, which inter- lace, and form an intricate kind of net work in the lateral parts of the body.

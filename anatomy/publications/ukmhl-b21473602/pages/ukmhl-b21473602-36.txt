From his age, indeed, to the beginning of the sixteenth century, little need be said of the history of the sci- ence. In some countries, it was not culti- vated at all; and where it was studied, its professors were satisfied with copies and compilations from the Greek authors, espe- cially from Galen himself. As those who copy, profess to follow, it is no great wonder that they did not outstrip their prede- cessors. The most celebrated copyists and com- pilers from the Greek anatomists, were the Arabians under the Caliphs; but religious ceremonies prevented them from perform- ing actual dissections.

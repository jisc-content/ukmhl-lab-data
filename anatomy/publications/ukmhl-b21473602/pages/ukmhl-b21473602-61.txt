which give branches to the head and upper part, and afterwards unite into one grand trunk, or aorta, which again divides and subdivides in the trunk and other parts of the system. Another important set of organs is found in this class of animals, namely, those for the secretion and excretion of urine. They con- sist of the kidneys and urinary bladder ; the former are much larger, in proportion to the body, than in any other animal. They are placed close to the vertebral column, and often extend considerably farther than the abdominal cavity. In some, the ureters merely offer an enlargement before their termination; but in others, a distinct blad- der is formed, capable of containing a con- siderable quantity of urine; the external opening for the discharge of the urine is usually separate, but, in a few instances, is common with the anus.

74 mixed up with our daily business the study of a science of universal interest to all classes of men in all regions, and which affords un- limited range for the most active and worthy objects of inquiry, to the most exalted minds. I am confidient that you will not, for any momentary temptation, neglect so noble a privilegeâ€”that you will not, through in- dolence, turn it to your own disgrace. I am confident that the seeds of knowledge, which it will be our duty to sow, will yield an abundant harvest; and that we shall reap hereafter that most pleasing of all re- wards, the gratitude of men who are them- selves the objects of the respect and grati- tude of the community. If so, I shall ever have cause to remember, with pride, that I have been the first here to put my hand to the plough. TPIE END.

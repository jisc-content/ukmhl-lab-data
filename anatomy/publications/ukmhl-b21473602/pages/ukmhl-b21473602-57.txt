In the Vermes, and Mollusc a, the next grand divisions, a glandular structure for the assistance of digestion is first manifest; salivary glands and a proper liver are found. The vascular system is rendered more complete by the addition of a ventricle, or ventricles, fleshy, and assuming decidedly the character of a heart.

Fine uon- mediiUated nerve-fibres, va^o-motor fibres, accompany these capillary vessels, and break up into ele- mentary fibrils, which form a net- work around the vessels. Horslev has demonstrated certain meduUated fibres running in the epmeurium and terminating in small spheroidal tactile corpuscles or end-bulbs oi Krause. These nerve-fibres, which Marshall behevesto be sensory, and which he has termed 7iervi nervorum, are considered by him to have an important bearing upon certain uem-algic pains. . The nerve-fibres, as far as is at present known, do not coalesce, but pursue an iminterrupted course from the centre to the periphery. In separating a nerve, however, into its component fumcuh, it may be seen that these do not pursue a perfectlv insulated course, but occasionally join at a very acute angle N^th other fumcuh proceeding in the same direction ; from this, branches are gi^*^!^ X" s =rbe^t^^| understood, however, that in tl^-—f ^ t^S^^^^^ municate with branches of a •^^(jWl^Xi S^^^^ a Pl^^"« ? thus take place form what is «f «^ the primary branches of the trunks "f^^^^^ ^''tLn^ -^^^^^-^ i„ the plexuses and sacral plexuses-and ^^iZu^ion of a plexus, the oomponen formed at the periphery of the '^o^>'-),"^V ■ ^^^^i, „ complex manner that the iiervc-bumile.

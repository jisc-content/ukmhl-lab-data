370 SYNDESMOLOGY are the intorphalangeal joints and the joint between the humerus and ulna; llie knee and ankle-joints are less typical, as they allow a slight degree of rotation or lateral movement in certaia positions of the limb. Trochoid or Pivot-joint.-—Where the movement is limited to rotation, the joint is formed by a pivot-like process turning within a ring, or a ring on a pivot, the rmg being formed partly of bone, partly of ligament. In the superior radio-ulnar articulation, the rmg is formed by the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna and the orbicular ligament; here, the head of the radius rotates within the ring. In the articulation of the odontoid process of the axis with the atlas, the ring is formed in front by the anterior arch of the atlas, behind, by the transverse ligament; here, the ring rotates round the odontoid process. Condyloid Articulation.—In this form of joint, an ovoid articular head, or condyle, is received into an eUiptical cavity in such a manner as to permit of flexion, extension, adduction, abduction and circumduction, but no axial rotation. The articular surfaces are coimected together by anterior, posterior, and lateral ligaments. The wrist-joint is an example of this form of articulation. Articulation by Reciprocal Reception {saddle-joini).—In this variety the opposing surfaces are reciprocally concavo-convex. The movements are the same as in the preceding form ; that is to say, flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction are allowed, but no axial rotation. The articular surfaces are connected by a capsular ligament. The best example of tins form is the carpo-metacarpal joint of the thumb. Enarthrosis is that variety of joint in which the distal bone is capable of motion around an indefinite number of axes, which have one common centre. It is formed by the reception of a globular head into a deep cup-like ca_vity (hence the name ' baU-and-socket'), the parts being kept m apposition by a capsular ligament strengthened by accessory ligamentous bands. Examples of this form of articulation are found in the hip and shoulder. Arthrodia is a variety of joint which admits of only gliding movement; it is formed by the apposition of plane surfaces, or one slightly concave the other slightly convex, the amount of motion between them bemg Jmiited by the ligaments or osseous processes surrounding the articulation ; as in the joints between the articular processes of the vertebrae, the carpal jomts except that of the os magnum with the scaphoid and semilunar, and the tarsal ioints with the exception of that between the astragalus and the navicular. On the next page, in a tabular form, are the names, distmctive characters, and examples of the different kinds of articulations. The Kinds of Movement admitted in Joints The movements admissible in joints may be divided into four kinds : gUding and angular movements, circumduction, and rotation. These movements are often howevlr more or less combined in the various j^aints, so as to produce an infinite variety and it is seldom that we find only one kind of motion m any particular ]om . mld^ movement is the simplest land of motion that can take placY^ a pint, one surface gUding or mo^dng over another without any angular or rotatoiy move- men It is'common to all m'ovable joints ; but m some, as in most ofthe^-^^^^^^^^^^^ tions of the carpus and tarsus, it is the only motion l^^^-^f^^^J^'^^T^^^ is not confined to plane surfaces, but may exist between any two contiguous surfaces, ^l:X'^oZner^ occurs only between, the long bones, and by it th^^^^^^^^ between the two bones is increased or diimmshed.

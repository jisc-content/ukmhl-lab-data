EMBRYOLOGY 104 cartilaginous body. The hypochordal bar becomes developed into the anterior arch of the bone, while the cartilaginous body forms the odontoid process which fuses with the body of the second cervical vertebra. The portions of the notochord which are surrounded by the bodies of the vertebrte atrophy, and ultimately disappear, while the parts which lie in the centres of the intervertebral discs undergo enlargement, and persist throughout life as the central nucleus fulposus of the discs (fig. 130). The ribs.—The ribs are formed from the ventral or costal processes of the primitive vertebral bows, the processes extending outwards between the muscle- plates. In the thoracic region of the vertebral column the costal processes of the vertebral bows grow outwards to form a series of arches, the primitive costal arches. As already described, the transverse process grows out behind the vertebral end of each arch. It is at first connected to the costal process by continuous meso- derm, but this becomes differentiated later to form the costo-transverse ligaments ; between the costal process and the tip of the transverse process the costo-transverse joint is formed by absorption. The costal process becomes separated from the vertebral bow by the development of the costo-central jomt. In the cervical vertehrcB the transverse process forms the posterior boundary of the foramen transversarium, while the costal process corresponding to the head and neck of the rib fuses with the body of the vertebra, and forms the antero- FiG. 130.—Sagittal section through the intervertebral disc and adjacent parts of two vertebrse of an advanced sheep's embryo.

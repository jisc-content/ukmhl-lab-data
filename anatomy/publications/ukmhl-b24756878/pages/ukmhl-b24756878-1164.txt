1146 SPLANCHNOLOGY the villus by means of llie reticular tissue, and it is along this path that the chyle passes in tlie process of absorption by the villi. That is to say, it passes first of all into the columnar epithelial cells, and, escai)ing from them, is carried into the reticulum of the villus, and thence into the central lacteal. , , ,^ t i The simple follicles, or cry}7ls of Lieberkiihn (gl. intestmales) (figs. 944, 945), are found in considerable numbers over every part of the mucous memljrane of the small mtestme.

They consist of minute tuliular depressions of the mucous membrane, arranged perpen- dicularly to the sui-face, upon which they open by small cu-cular apertm-es. Tliey may be seen with the aid of a lens, their orifices appearing as minute dots scattered between the vilH. Theii- walls are thin, consisting of a basement-membrane hned by columnar epitheUum, and covered on theii- exterior by capillary vessels. , , , . ^ ' The duodenal or Brunner's glands (gl. duodenales) are limited to the duodenum, and are found in the submucous areolar tissue. Tliey are largest and most numerous near the pylorus, forming an almost complete layer in the fkst and upper half of the second portions of the duodenum. They then begin to diminish in number, and practically disappear at the junction of the duodenum and jejunum. They are small compound acino-tubular glands, consisting of a number of alveoli lined by short cohminar epithelium and opening by a single duct on the inner surface of the intestine. . The solitary glands (noduli lymphatici sohtaru) (fig. 94G) are found scattered throughout the mucous membrane of the small intestine, but are most numerous in the lower part of the ileum. They are small, round, lymphoid nodules ; then- free surfaces are covered with rudimentary villi, except at the summit, and each gland is surrounded by the open- ings of the follicles of Lieberkiihn. Each consists of a dense interlacing retiform tissue closely packed with lymi)h-corpuscles. and i)ermeated with an abundant ca])illary network. The interspaces oi the retiform tissue are continuous with larger iynii>li- snaces which sui-round the gland, through which they communicate with the lacteal system.

992 NEUROLOGY tlie anterior and middle cerebral arteries and the ophthalmic artery : along the former vessels, they maybe traced to the pia mater ; along the latter, into the orbit where they accompany eacli of the branches of the vessel, l ie filaments' prolonged on to the anterior communicatmg artery connect the sympathetic nerves of the right and left sides The inferior branch communicates with the middle cervical ganghon. The external branches are communicating, and consist of grey rami communicantes to the upper four cervical nerves and to certain of the cranial nerves Sometimes the branch to the fourth cervical nerve may come from the cord connecting the upper and middle cervical ganglia The branches o the cranial nervts consist of delicate filaments, which run to the ganghon of the trunk of the pneumogastric, and to the hypoglossal nerve A separate filament (nervus jugularis) passes upwards to the base of the skuU and subdivides to join the petrous ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal, and the ffanslion of the root of the pneumogastric in the jugular foramen ^ Thrinternal branches are peripheral, and are the pharyngeal branches, and the i pm-o^ cardmc nerve.

726 ANGIOLOGY Branches.—The plantar arch, besides distributing numerous branches to the muscles, integument, and fascise in the sole, gives off the following branches : Posterior perforating. Digital—Anterior perforating. The posterior perforating (rami perforantes) are three small branches, which ascend through the back part of the outer three interosseous spaces, between the heads of the Dorsal interosseous muscles, and anastomose with, the mterosseoua branches from the metatarsal artery. . The digital branches (aa. metatarsese plantares) are four m number, and supply the outer three toes and half the second toe. The first anses from the outer side of the plantar arch, and is distributed to the outer side of the little toe, passing in its course beneath the Abductor and Flexor brevis minimi digiti. ilie second, third, and fourth rmi forwards along the interosseous spaces, and on arnving at the clefts between the toes divide into collateral branches (aa. digitales plantares), which supply the adjacent sides of the outer three toes and the outer side of the second. Near to its point of bifurcation, each digital artery sends upwards, through the fore part of the corresponding interosseous space, a small branch, tne anterior perforating miery, which anastomoses with the correspondmg mterosseous branch of the metatarsal artery. , , .j r 4. From the description given it mil be seen that both sides of the outer three toes and the outer side of the second toe, are suppUed by branches from the plantar arch ; both sides of the great toe, and the inner side of the second, are supplied by the arteria magna hallucis. THE VEINS The veins convey the blood from the capiUaries of the different parts of the body to the heart. They consist of two distinct sets of vessels, the ^"'Thr^uTmVn'aTveins are concerned in the circulation in the lungs.

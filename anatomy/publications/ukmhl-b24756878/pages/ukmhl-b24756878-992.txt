974 NEUROLOGY filaments which pass backwards across the outer and posterior surface of the thigh, supplying the integument from tlie level of the great trochanter to the ™^^Tlie°obturator (n. obturatorius) supplies the Obturator externus and the Adductor muscles of the thigh, the articulations of the hip and knee, and occasionally part of the integument of the thigh and leg It arises from tlie secJnd thiKl^ and fourth lumbar nerves. Of these, the branch from the third is the largest, while that from the second is often very small It descends through the inner fibres of the Psoas muscle, and emerges from its inner border near the brim of the pelvis ; it then passes behind the ^^^^'^^^J'^l^^^^^^ which separate it from the ureter, and runs along the lateral AVall of the pelvis, above tKbturator vessels, to the upper part of the obturator foramen Here t enters the thigh, and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch, ^aS^are separated at first by some of the fibres of the Obturator externus (fin- f^d.^^ and lower down by the Adductor brevis. , , ^, ^"^^The an'?ir« (ramus anterior) (fig. 808) passes down m front of he Adductor brevis being covered by the Pectmeus and Adductor longus at the bwe^bo del 0 the latter muscle it communicates with the internal cutaneous and internal saphenous branches of the anterior crural formmg a k^d of Xxuf It then descends upon the femoral artery, to which it is finally di.- trfbuted The nerve near the obturator foramen, gives off an articular branch to The hip^oLt B^^ the Pectineus, it distributes muscular branches to the Adducto; longus and Gracilis, and usually to the Adductor brevis and S rare cases to the Pectnxeus, and receives a communicatmg branch fi'om tbp arcpssorv obturator nerve when that nerve is present.

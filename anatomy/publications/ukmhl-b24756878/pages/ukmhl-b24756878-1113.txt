THE TEETH 1095 Fig. 902.—Permanent teeth of right half of mandible seen from above. Incisora Canine Molars The crown is large and conical, very convex on its labial surface, a little hollowed and uneven on its lingual surface, and tapering to a blunted point or cusp, which projects beyond the level of the other teeth. The root is single, but longer and thicker than that of tiie incisors, conical in form, compressed laterally, and marked by a slight groove on each side. The upper canine teeth (popularly called mje-teeth) are larger and longer than the lower, and situated a little distaUyto them. They usually present | v a distinct basal ridge. i ^ a ( The lower canine teeth are placed mesially to the upper, so that their sum- mits correspond to the interval between the upper canine teeth and the neigh- bouring incisors on each side. The bicuspid teeth or premolars (dentes premolares) are eight in number : four in each jaw, two being placed dis- tally to each of the canine teeth. They are smaller and shorter than the canines. The crown is compressed proximo- distally, and surmounted by two pyra- midal eminences or cusps, a labial and a lingual, separated by a groove ; hence their name, bicuspid. Of the two cusps the labial is larger and more prominent than the lingual. Tlie neck is oval. The root is generally single, compressed, and presents on either side a deep groove, wliich indicates a tendency in the root to become double. The apex is generally bifid. The upper bicuspids are larger, and present a greater tendency to the division of their roots than the lower ; this is especially marked in the first upper bicuspid. Fig. 903.—Permanent teeth. Right side. (Burchard.) The molar teeth (dentes molares) are the largest of the permanent set, and are adapted from the great breadth of their crowns for grinding and pounding the food. They are twelve in number : six in each jaw, three being placed distally to each of the second bicuspids.

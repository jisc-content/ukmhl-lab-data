365 SESAMOID BONES metatarso-phalangeal joints of the second and fifth toes, one occasionally at the corresponding joint of the third and fourth toes, and one at the inter- plialangeal joint of the great toe. Sesamoid bones apart from jomts are seldom found in the tendons of the upper limb ; one is sometimes seen m the tendon of the Biceps opposite the tubercle of the radius. They are, however, present in several of the tendons of the lower limb, viz. one hi the tendon of the Peroneus longus, where it glides on the cuboid ; one, appearuig late in life, in the tendon of the Tibialis anticus, opposite the smooth facet of the mternal cuneiform bone ; one in the tendon of the Tibialis posticus, opposite the uiner side of the head of the astra- galus ; one in the outer head of the Gastrocnemius, behind the outer condyle of the femur ; and one in the conjoined tendon of the Psoas and Iliacus, where it glides over the pubis. Sesamoid bones are found occasionally in the tendon of the Gluteus maximus, as it passes over the great trochanter, and in the tendons which M'md round the inner and outer malleoli.

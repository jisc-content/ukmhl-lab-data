637 INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY 8. The internal maxillary artery (a. maxillaris interna) (fig. 577), the lai-'^er of the two terminal branches of the external carotid, arises behind the°neck of the mandible, and is at first imbedded in the substance of the parotid »land ; it passes inwards between the ramus of the mandible and the internal lateral ligament, and then upon the outer surface of the External pterygoid muscle to the spheno-maxillary fossa to supply the deep structures of the°face. For convenience of description, it is divided into maxillary, ptery- goid, and spheno-maxillary portions. , , . , The first or maxillary fortion passes horizontally forwards and mwards, between" the ramus of the mandible and the internal lateral ligament, where Fig. 577.—The internal maxillary artery, and its branches. Fig. 578.—Plan of the branches. Plerifijo-palaline it lies parallel to and a little below the auriculo-temporal nerve ; it crosses the inferior dental nerve, and runs along the lower border of the External pterygoid. The second or pterygoid portion runs obliquely forwards and upwards under cover of the ramus of the mandible, on the outer (very frequently on the inner) surface of the External pterygoid ; it then passes between the two iieads of origin of this muscle and enters the spheno-maxillary fossa. Tlie third or spheno-maxillary portion lies in the spheno-maxillary fossa m relation with Meckel's ganglion.

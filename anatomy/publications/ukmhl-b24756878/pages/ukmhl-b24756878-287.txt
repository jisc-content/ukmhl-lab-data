269 THE SKULL FROM THE FRONT stand out more or less prominently, and beneath these are the superciliary ridges, joined to one another in tlio middle by the glabella. On and above the glabella a trace of the interfronlal suture sometimes persists ; beneath it is the fronto-nasal suture, the mid-point of which is termed the nasion. Behind and below the fronto-nasal suture tlie internal angular process of the frontal articulates with tlie lachrymal and with the frontal process of the maxiUa. Arching between the internal and external angular processes of the frontal is the upper part of the margin of the orbit, thin and prominent in its outer two-thu-ds, rounded in its inner third, and presenting, at the junction of these two portions, the supra-orbital notch or foramen for the supra-orbital nerve and vessels. The external angular process articulates with the malar, and from it the temporal line extends upwards and backwards. Below the Fig. 341.—Anterior region of the skull. fronto-nasal suture is the bridge of the nose, convex from side to side, concavo- convex from above downwards, and formed by the two nasal bones su]i]Mrted m the middle line by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, and lateriilly by the frontal processes of the maxUlaj which are prolonged up\vards bet^^•een the nasal and lachrymal bones and form the lower and iimer part of the circumference of each orbit. Below tlie nasal bones and betw^een the maxilla; IS the anterior aperture of the nose, pyriform in shape, with the narrow end directed upwards. Laterally this opening is bounded bv sharp margins, to which the lateral cartilages of the nose are attached ; beiow, the margins are thicker and curve inwards and forwards to end in the anterior nasal spine. Un looking into the nasal cavity, the bony septum Avhich separates the nasal tossse presents, in front, a large triangular deficiencv ; this, in the recent

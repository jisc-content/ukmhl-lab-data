APPLIED ANATOMY OF MUSCLES OP LOWER EXTREMITY 596 Applied Anatomy.—The student should now consider the effects produced by the action of the various muscles in fractures of the bones of the lower extremity. The more common forms of fracture are selected for illustration and description. In fracture of the neck of the femur internal to the capsular ligament (fig. 554), the characteristic signs are sliglit shortening of the limb, and eversion of the foot, neither of which occurs, however, in some cases until some time after the injury. The eversion is caused by the weight of the limb rotating it outwards. The shortening is produced by the action of the Glutei, and by the Rectus femoris in front, and the Biceps, Semitendinosus and Semimembranosus behind. In fracture of the femur just helow the trochanters (fig. 555), the upper fragment is tilted forwards almost at right angles with the pelvis, by the lUo-psoas ; and, at the same time, everted and drawn outwards by the external rotator muscles and Glutei causing a marked prommence at the upper and outer side of the thigh, and much pain from the bruising and laceration of the muscles. The limb is shortened, because the lower Fig. 555.—Fracture of the femur below the trochanters. Fia. 556.—Fractui-e of the femur above the condyles. Fig. 557.—Fracture of the patella. Semimembranosus Semitendinosus fragment is drawn upwards by the Rectus in front, and the Biceps, Semunembranosus and Semitendmosus behind • it is, at the same time, everted. This fracture maybe reduced by relaxation of aU the muscles involved to effect which the Umb should be put up with the thigh flexed on the pelvis and the leg on the thigh. Oblique fracture of the femur" immediateh, above the condyles (fig. 556) is a formidable injury, and attended \yith considerable displacement. On examination of the limb, the lower fragment may bo felt deep in the popUteal space, bemg dra-wn backwards by the Gastrocnemius, and upwards by the Hamstring and Rectus muscles.

971 LUMBAR PLEXUS the genito-crural nerve. The remainder of the second nerve, and the third and fourth nerves, divide into ventral and dorsal divisions. The ventral division of the second unites with tlie ventral divisions of the third and fourth nerves to form the obturator nerve. Tlie dorsal divisions of the.second and third nerves divide into two branches, a smaller branch from each uniting to form the external cutaneous nerve, and a larger branch from each joining with the dorsal division of the fourth lumbar nerve to form the anterior Fig. 80.5.â€”The lumbar plexus and its branches. crural nerve. The accessory obturator, when it exists, is formed by the union of two small branches given off from the third and fourth nerves. The branches of the lumbar plexus may therefore be arranged as follows : Ilio-hypogastric XL. Ilio-inguinal 1 L. Genito-crural 1, 2 L. Dorsal divisions. External cutaneous 2, .3, L. Anterior crural 2. 3, 4 L. Ventral divisions. Obturator . 2, 3, 4 L. Accessory obturator 3, 4 L. The ilio-hypogastric (n. iliohypogastricus) arises from the first lumbar nerve. It emerges from the outer border of tlie Psoas muscle at its upper

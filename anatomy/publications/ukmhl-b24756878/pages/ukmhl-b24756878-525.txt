MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN 507 It is joined with that of the opposite muscle along the median line, and covers the whole of the front of the abdomen ; above, it is covered by and gives origui to the lower border of tlie Pectoralis major ; below, its fibres are closely aggregated together, and extend obliquely across from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine of the pubis and the linea ilio- pectinea. In the median line, it interlaces with the aponeurosis of the opposite muscle, forming the linea alba, which extends from the ensiform cartilage to the symphysis pubis. Fig. 502.—The External oblique muscle. That portion of the aponeurosis which extends between the anterior superior spine ot the ilium and the spine of the pubis is a thick band, folded inwards, ana continuous below with the fascia lata ; it is called Poupart's ligament. J-ne portion which is reflected from Poupart's ligament at the spine of the puDis along the pectmeal line is called Oimbernat's ligament. From the point or attachment of the latter to the pectineal line, a few fibres pass upwards and inwards behmd the inner pillar of the external abdominal ring, to the linea *u.Da ihey diverge as they ascend, and form a thin triangular fibrous layer. Which is caUed the <nawj«toj-/ascm.

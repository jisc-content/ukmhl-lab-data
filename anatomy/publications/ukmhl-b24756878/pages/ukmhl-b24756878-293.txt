275 THE NASAL FOSS^ these channels, in its passage to the jugular foramen, grooves the occipital, the postero-inferior angle of the parietal, the mastoid portion of the temporal, and the jugular process of the occipital, and terminates at the back part of the jugular foramen. Wliere this sinus grooves the mastoid portion of the temporal, the orifice of the mastoid foramen may be seen; and, just previous to its termination, the posterior condyloid foramen opens into it; neither foramen is constant. The Nasal Foss^ The nasal fossae are two irregular cavities, situated one on either side of the middle line of the face, extending from the base of the cranium to the roof of the mouth, and separated from each other by a thin vertical septum. They open on the face thi-ough the pear-shaped anterior nasal aperture, and communicate behind with the nasal part of the pharynx by the posterior naves or choance. They are much narrower above than below, and in the middle than at their anterior or posterior openings : then- depth, which is considerable, IS greatest in the middle. They communicate mth the frontal, ethmoidal' sphenoidal, and maxillary sinuses. Each fossa is bounded by a roof, a floor' an inner and an outer wah. ' ' Fig. 343.—Inner wall of left nasal fossa.

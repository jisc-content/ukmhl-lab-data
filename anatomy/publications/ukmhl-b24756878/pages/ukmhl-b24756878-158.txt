EMBRYOLOGY 140 is re-established through an opening which is developed in the upper part of the septum primum ; this opening is known as the foramen ovale (ostium secundum of Born) and persists mitil birth. A second septum, the seftum secundum, semilunar in shape, grows downwards fx'om the upper wall of the auricle 'to the right of the primary septum and foramen ovale. Shortly after birth it fuses with the primary septum, and by this means the foramen ovale is closed, but sometimes the fusion is incomplete and the upper part of the foramen remains patent. The annulus ovalis denotes the free margin of the septum secundum. Fig. 187.—Diagrams to illustrate the transformation of the bulbus cordis.

The primitive ventricle becomes divided by a septum, the septum tnfenus or ventricular sepum (figs. 186, 189), which grows upwards from the lower part of the ventricle, its position being indicated on the surface of the hea_rt by a 1]iitow. Its dorsal part grows more rapidly than its ventral portion, and fuses witJi tlie dorsal part of the septum intermedium. For a time an interventricular foramen exists above its ventral portion, but this foramen is ultimately closed by the fusion of the aortic septum with the ventricular septum. As already stated, the aortic bulb consists of a proximal muscular portion, the bulbus cordis, and a distal portion, the primitive aortic stem.

THE FEMALE URETHRA 1203 orifice of the vagina, and the diminutive penis is taken for an enlarged clitoris. There is no remedy for this condition. A much more uncommon form of malformation is where there is an api)arent deficiency of the upper wall of the urethra ; this is named epispadias. The deficiency may vary in extent; when it is complete the condition is associated wth extroversion of the bladder (see page 1199). In less extensive cases, where there is no extroversion, there is an infundi- buhform openmg nito the bladder. The penis is usually dwarfed and turned upwards, so that the glans lies over the opening. The Female Urethra (fig. 995) The female urethra (urethra muliebris) is a narrow membranous canal about an inch and a lialf in length, extending from the neck of the bladder to the meatus unnarius. It is placed beliind the symphysis pubis, imbedded m the anterior wall of the vagina, and its direction is obliquely downwards and forwards; it is slightly curved with the concavity directed forwards and upwards. Its diameter when undilated is about a quarter of an inch. It pertorates the triangular Ugament, and its external orifice is situated directly m tront ot the vaginal opening and about an inch behind the glans clitoridis. structure.—The lu-ethra consists of three coats : muscular, erectile, and mucous. The muscular coat is continuous mth that of the bladder ; it extends the whole length of the tube, and consists of circular fibres.

485 PALATAL REGION The Palato-glossus (m. glossopalatinus) is a small fleshy fasciculus, narrower in the middle than at either extremity, forming, with the mucous membrane covering its surface, the anterior pillar of the fauces. It arises from the anterior surface of the soft palate, where it is continuous with the muscle of the opposite side, and passing downwards, forwards, and outwards in front of the tonsil, is inserted into the side of the tongue, some of its fibres spreading over the dorsum, and others passing deeply into the substance of the organ to intermingle with the Transverse lingualis. The Palato-pharyngeus (m. pharyngopalatinus) is along, fleshy fasciculus narrower in the middle than at either extremity, forming, with the mucous membrane covering its surface, the posterior pillar of the fauces. It is separated from the Palato-glossus by an angular interval, in which the tonsil is lodged. It arises from the soft palate by an expanded fasciculus, which is divided into I'lO. 495.—Muscles of the soft palate. The pharynx is laid open from behind. two parts by the Levator palati and Azygos uvulae. The posterior fasciculus lies in contact with the mucous membrane, and joins with the corresponding muscle in the middle line ; the anterior fasciculus, the thicker, lies in the soft palate between the Levator and Tensor, and joins in the middle lino the corresponding part of the opposite muscle. Passing outwards and downwards behind the tonsil, the Palato-pharyngeus joins the Stylo-pharyngeus, and IS inserted with that muscle into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage, some of its fibres being lost on the side of the pharynx, and others passing across the middle line posteriorly, to decussate with the muscle of the opposite side. The Salpingo-pharyngeus.—This muscle arises from the inferior part of the Eustacliian tube near its orifice; it passes downwards and blends with the liosterior fasciculus of the Palato-pharyngeus.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL 151 from the duodenum ; the descending, ihac, and pelvic parts of the colon, the rectum and the tubular stalk of the allantois are developed from the hind-gut; the mid-gut gives origin to the remainder of the alimentary tube. The mouth. —The mouth is developed partly from the stomatodseum, and partly from the floor of the anterior portion of the fore-gut.

It is lined by ectoderm, and is separated from the anterior end of the fore-gut by the oral plate, wMch is now named the phanjngeal septum (fig. 201). This septum is devoid of mesoderm, being formed by the apposition of the stomatodseal ectoderm with the fore-gut entoderm ; at the end of a fortnight it

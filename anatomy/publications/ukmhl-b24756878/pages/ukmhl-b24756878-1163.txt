The walls are composed of a single layer of endothelial cells, the interstitial substance between the cells being continuous with the reticulum of the matrix. Fig. 943.—Villi of small intestine.

The muscular fibres are derived from the muscularis mucosfe, and are arranged in longitudinal bundles around the lacteal vessel, extending from the base to the summit of the villus, and giving oiT, laterally, individual muscle-cells, \\^\c\\ are enclosed by the reticulum, and by it are attached to the basement-mem- brane. Tlie blood-vessels form a plexus between the lacteal and the basement-membrane, and are enclosed in the reticular tissue. In the interstices of the capillary plexus are contained the cells of the villus. Tliese structures are suiTOunded by the basement-membrane, which is made up of a stratum of endothelial cells, and upon this is placed a layer of columnar epithe- lium. The reticulum of the matrix is con- tinuous through the basement-membrane (that is, through the interstitial substance between the individual endothelial cells) with the interstitial cement-substance of the columnar cells on the surface of the villus. Thus we are enabled to trace a direct continuity between the interior of the lacteal and the surface of

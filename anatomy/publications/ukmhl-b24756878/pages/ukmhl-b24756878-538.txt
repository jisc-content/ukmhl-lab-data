520 MYOLOGY of tlie sympliysis ; behind, from the inner surface of the spine of the iscliium ; and between these two points, from the obturator fascia. Posteriorly, thi.s fascial origin corresponds, more or less closely, with the white line (page 519), but in front, the muscle arises from the fascia at a varying distance above the white line, in some cases reaching nearly as high as the canal for the obturator vessels and nerve. The fibres pass downwards to the middle line of the floor of the pelvis ; the most posterior are inserted into the sides of the last two segments of the coccyx ; those placed more anteriorly unite with the muscle of the opposite side, in a median fibrous raphe {ano-coccyr/eal raphe), which extends between the coccyx and the margin of the anus. The Fig. 513.â€”Left levator ani from within. Left lobe of prostatr (jhnul [riii) Ano-coccygcal raphe middle fibres are inserted into the side of the rectum, blending with the fibres of the Sphmcter muscles ; lastly, the anterior fibres descend upon the side of the prostate gland to unite beneath it with the muscle of the opposite side, joining with the fibres of the External sphincter and Transversus periiiEei muscles at the central tendinous point of the perinajum. The anterior portion is occasionally separated from the rest of the muscle by connective tissue. From this circumstance, as well as from its pecuhar relation with the prostate gland, descending by its side, and surrounding it as in a sling, it has been'described by Santorini and others as a distinct muscle, under the name of Levator prostata:. In the female the anterior hbres of the Levator ani descend upon the side of the vagina.

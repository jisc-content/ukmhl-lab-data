838 NEUROLOGY the median sulcus is an elongated eminence, the eminenha teres, the nucleus of the sixth nerve, and is, in part at least, produced by the ascendmg portion of the root of the seventh nerve. This eminence becomes less dibtinct above, while below it is continuous with the tngonum hypoglossx Outside the superior fovea is the prominence of the area acustica {ahe^dy referred to) , and ab?ve it is a bluish, depressed spot, the locus cc^ruleus, which owes its colour to an underlying patch of deeply pigmented nerve-cells, termed ^^^J^i^^^l^f^ ferruginosa, in which a part of the sensory root of the fifth nerve termmates. THE MID-BRAIN The mid-brain, or mesencephalon (fig. 711), is the short constricted portion which cZects th^ pons Varohi and cerebellum with the tl-W^^^^ and cerebral hemispheres. It is directed upwards and forwards, and consists ot. n rventro-kteral portion, composed of a pair of cyhndrical bodies, named the cr^TcerX?

They emerge from the upper surface of the pons Varohi. one on either side of the middle Ime, and, divergmg as they pass upwards and forwards, disappear into the substance of the cerebral hemi- spheres. The depressed area between the crura is termed the locus perforatus posticus or fossa inter peduncularis, and consists of a layer of greyisli matter (substantia perforata posterior) which is pierced by numerous small apertures for the transmission of blood- vessels. Its lower part hes on the ventral aspect of the mesial portions of the tegmenta, and contains a nucleus named the ganglion inter peduncular e (pag( 840) ; its upper part assists m forming the floor of the third ventricle. The ventral surface of each crus is crossed from within outwards by the superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries ; its lateral surface ism relation to theuncuiatc convolu- tion of the cerebral hemispliere and is crossed from behuid forwards by the fom-th -J-'^^.^'^^.^^^i^^K^-j' disappearance into the cerebral l^^^^^P'^"^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^ Til orus forms around its ventro-lateral surface. ^ nf Hmce tomni as the interpedun- lateral boundary of the posterior V^'^^.^r^^^^^ cular space, and is marked by a ^o'V^'tudmal fu ^^^^ ^j^^ wliich the roots of the third or o^"^"''™ ^^^^^^^ the sulcus surface of eacli crus there ,e^^^^^ ( 7 uperior and middle 19.

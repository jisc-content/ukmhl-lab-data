The outer surface is in contact with the parietal peri- toneum, which lines the fossa ovarii ; tlie inner surface is to a large extent covered by the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tube. The anterior or straight border is directed towards the obliterated hypogastric artery, and is attached to the back of the broad ligament by a short fold named the mes- Fia. 1011.—Adult ovary, epoophoron, and Fallopian tube.

SPLANCHNOLOGY 1156 inwards from the left side of the tube, opposite the middle of the sacrum; a third, the largest and most constant, projects backwards from the fore part of the rectimi, opposite the base of the bladder. When a fourth is present, it is situated nearly an inch above the anus on the left and posterior wall of the tube. These folds are about half an inch in width, and contain some of the chcular fibres of the gut. In the empty state of the intes- tines they overlai) each other, as Houston remarks, so effectually as to require considerable manoeuvring to conduct a bougie or the finger along to the canal of the intestine. Their use seems to be, ' to support the weight of fascal matter, and prevent its urging towards the anus, where its presence always excites a sensation demanding its discharge.' * The Ixmaen of the anal canal presents, in its upper half, a mmiber of vertical folds, produced by an infolding of the mucous membrane and some of the muscular tissue. They are known as the columns of Morgagni (fig. 956), and are separated from one another by furrows, which terminate below in small valve-hke folds, termed anal valves, which join together the lower ends of the columns of Morgagni. As in the small intestine, the mucous membrane consists of: a muscular layer, the muscularis mucosae; a quantity of retiform tissue in which the vessels rainify; a Ylq. 956.—Coronal section of rectum and anal canal.

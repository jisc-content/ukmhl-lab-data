139 DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEART subsequently divided to form the Eustachian and Thebesian valves. At the lower extremity of the sUt is a triangular thickening, the spina vesHbuli of His which partly closes the aperture between the two auricles, and, according to His' takes a part in the formation of both the interauricular and mterventncular '^^The auricular canal is at first a short straight tube connecting the auricular with the ventricular portion of the heart, but its growth is relatively slow, and it Fig. 185.—Heart of human embryo, 4-2 mm. long, seen from behind. (His.) Aortic bulb Vitelline ceiii becomes overlapped by the auricles and ventricles so that its position on the surface of the heart is indicated only by an annular constriction (fig. 184). Its lumen is reduced to a transverse sUt, and two thickenings appear, one on its dorsal and another on its ventral wall. These thickenings, or endocardial cushions (fig. 189) as they are termed, project into the canal, and, meeting in the middle fine, unite to form the septum intermedium which di^ades the canal into two channels, the future right and left auriculo-ventricular orifices.

Aortic septum The primitive auricular cavity becomes subdivided into right and left aui-icles by an incomplete septum, the septum primum (fig. 189), which grows down- wards into the auricular cavity. For a time the two auricles communicate with each other by an opening, the ostium primum of Born, below the free margin of the septum. This opening is, however, closed by the union of the septum primum with the septum intermedium, and the communication between the auricles

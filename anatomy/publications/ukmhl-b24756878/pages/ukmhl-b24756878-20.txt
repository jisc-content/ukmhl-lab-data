The mesial plane is a vertical antero-postenor plane, passing tlirough the centre of the trunk. This plane ^^ill pass approximately through the sagittal suture of the skuU, and hence any plane paraUel to it is termed a sagittal plane.

A plane at right angles to both the mesial and coronal v,\a,nes is termed a transverse plane. j j^rl^VntP The terms anterior or ventral, and posterior or dorsal, are employed to mdicate the relation of parts to the front or back of the body and the terms supertor or cephalic, and inferior or caudal, to indicate the relative levels of different structures.

MUSCLES AND FASCIAE OF THORACIC REGION 531 and protects the axillary vessels and nerves. Traced upwards, it splits to enclose the Subclavius muscle, and its two layers are attached to the clavicle, one in front of and the other behind the muscle ; the latter layer fuses with the deep cervical fascia and witli the sheath of the axillary vessels. Internally, it blends with the fascia covering the first two intercostal spaces, and is attached also to the first rib internal to the origin of the Subclavius muscle. Externally, it is very thick and dense, and is attached to the coracoid process. The portion extending from the first rib to the coracoid process is often whiter and denser than the rest, and is sometimes called tlie costo-coracoid ligament. Below this, it is thin, and at the upper border of the Pectoralis minor it splits into two layers to invest the muscle ; from the lower border of the Pectoralis minor it is continued do-miwards to join the axillary fascia, and outwards to join Fia, 518.—^Muscles of the chest and front of the arm, with the boundaries of the axilla. the fascia over the short head of the Biceps. The costo-coracoid membrane is pierced by the cephalic vein, acromio-thoracic artery and vein, superior thoracic artery, and external anterior thoracic nerve. The Pectoralis minor (fig. 518) is a thin, flat, triangular muscle, situated at the upper part of the thorax, beneath the Pectoralis major. It arises by three tendinous digitations, from the upper margins and outer surfaces of the third, fourth, and fifth ribs, near tlieir cartilages, and from the aponeuroses covermg the Intercostal muscles ; the fibres pass upwards and outwards, and converge to form a flat tendon, which is inserted into the imier border and upper surface of the coracoid process of the scapula. Relations.—By its anterior surface it is in relation with the Pectoralis major, the external anterior thoracic nerve, and the thoracic branches of the acromio-thoracic artery. M M 2

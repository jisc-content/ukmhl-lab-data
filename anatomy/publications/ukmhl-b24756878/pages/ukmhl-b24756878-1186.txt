Ligaments.—The liver is connected to tlie under surface of the Diaphragm and to the anterior wall of the abdomen by five ligaments, four of which are peritoneal folds ; the fifth is a round, fibrous cord, resulting from the obhtera- tion of the umbihcal vein. These ligaments are the falciform, coronary, two lateral, and round. It is also attached to the lesser curvature of the stomach by the gastro-hepatic or small omentum (see page 1123). Tlio falciform ligament (lig. falciforme hepatis) is a broad and thin antero- posterior peritoneal fold, falciform in shape, its base being directed downwards and backwards, its apex upwards and backwards. It is attached by one margin to the under surface of the Diaphragm, and the posterior surface of the sheath of the right Rectus muscle as low down as the umbilicus ; by its hepatic margin it extends from the notch on the anterior margin of the liver, as far back as the posterior surface. It is composed of two layers of peritoneum closely united together. Its base or free edge contains the round ligament between its layers. The coronary ligament (lig. coronarium hepatis) consists of an upper and a lower layer. The upper layer is formed by the reflection of the peritoneum from the upper margin of the bare area of the liver to the under surface of the Diaphragm, and is continuous with the right layer of the falciform hgament. The lower layer is reflected from the lower margin of the bare area on to the right kidney and suprarenal gland. The lateral ligaments, two in number, right and left, are triangular m shape. The right lateral ligament (hg. triangulare dextrum) is situated at the right extremity of the bare area, and is a small fold which passes to the Diaphragm, being formed by the apposition of the upper and lower layers of the coronary hgament. The left lateral ligament (hg. triangulare smistrum) is a fold of some considerable size, which connects the posterior part of the upper surface of the left lobe to the Diaphragm ; its anterior layer is continuous with the left layer of the falciform hgament. The round ligament (hg. teres hepatis) is a fibrous cord resulting from the obhteration of the umbihcal vein. It ascends from the umbihcus, m the free margin of the falciform hgament, to the notch in the anterior border of the hver from wliich it may be traced along the longitudinal fissui-e on the inferior surface of the hver ; on the posterior surface it is contmued upwards as the obliterated ductus venosus (hg. venosum) as far as the inferior vena cava. Vessels and Nerves.—The vessels connected with the hver are, the hepatic artery, the portal vein, and the hepatic veins. The hevatic artery and portaZ vein, accompanied by numerous nerves, ascend to tJje transverse fissure, between the layers of the gastro-hepatic omentum. The hile-ducl and lymphatic vessels descend from the transverse fissure between the layers of the same omentum. The relative positions of the three structures are as follows^^^^^^^^^ duct lies to the right, the hepatic artery to the left, and the portal vein behind and between the other two.

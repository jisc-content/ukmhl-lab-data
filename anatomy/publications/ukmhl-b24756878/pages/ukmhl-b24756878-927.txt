FIFTH CRANIAL NER\1E 909 The lachrymal nerve (n. lacrimalis) is tlie smallest of the three branches of the ophthalmic. It sometimes receives a filament from the fourth nerve but this is possibly derived from the branch of communication which passes from the oplithalmic to the fourth. It passes forward in a separate tube of dura mater, and enters the orbit through the narrowest part of the sphenoidal fissure. In the orbit it runs along the ujiper border of the External rectus luuscle, with the lachrymal artery, and communicates with the temporo-malar branch of the superior maxillary. It enters the lachrymal gland and gives off several filaments, M'hicli supply the gland and the conjunctiva. FinaUv it pierces the superior palpebral ligament, and terminates in the integunient of the upper eyelid, joming with filaments of the facial nerve. The lachrymal nerve is occasionally absent, and in such eases its place is taken by the temporal branch of the superior maxillary. Sometimes the latter branch is absent, and a continuation of the lachiymal is substituted for it The frontal nerve (n. frontalis) is the largest division of the ophthalmic and may be regarded, both from its size and direction, as the continuation of the nerve. It enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, and runs forwards along the middle Ime, between the Levator palpebri and the periosteum. Midway between the apex and base of the orbit it divides into two branches, supratrochlear and supraorbital. The supralrochlear nerve (n. supratrochlearis), the smaUer of the two loasses inwards, above the pulley of the Superior oblique muscle, and gives off a descending filament, which joins with the infratrochlear branch of the nasal nerve. It hen escapes from the orbit bet^veen the pulley of the SupeSor oblique and the supraorbital foramen, curves up on to the forehead cK S the bone, ascends beneath the Corrugator supercilii and Occipito frontalis muscles, and dividmg mto branches, which pierce these muscles^, it suwHes tr^r^?

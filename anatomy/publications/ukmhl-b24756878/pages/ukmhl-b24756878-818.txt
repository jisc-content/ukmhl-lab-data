800 NEUROLOGY Fio. 67C.—Transverse sections of the spinal cord at dilTerent levels. C.l C2. C.5. The quantity of grey matter, as well as tlie form which it assumes on transverse section, varies markedly at different levels. It is small, not only in amount but relatively to the surrounding white substance, in the thoracic region. Its amount is greatly increased in the cervical and lumbar enlargements : in the latter, and especially in the conus meduUaris, its propor- tion to the white matter is greatest (fig. 676). In the cervical region its pcsterior cornu remains comparatively narrow, wliile its an- terior is broad and expanded ; in tlie tlioracic region, both cornua are attenuated, and the lateral horn is evident; in the lumbar enlarge- ment, both cornua are expanded ; while in tlic conus meduUaris the grey matter assumes the form of two oval masses, one in each half of the cord, connected together by a broad grey commissure. The central canal runs in the grey com- missure throughout the entire length of tlie cord. The part of the grey commissure in front of the canal is named the anterior grey commissure ; that behmd it, the posterior grey commissure. The former is thin, and is in contact anteriorly with the white commissure : it contains a couple of longitudinal vems, one on either side of the middle hne. The posterior grey commissure reaches from the central canal to the posterior median septum, and is thimiest in the thoracic region, and thickest in the conus meduUaris. The central canal is con- tinued upwards through the lower part of the meduUa oblongata, and opens into the fourth ventricle of the brain ; below, it reaches tor a short distance into the filum termuiale. in the lower part of the conus medullar is it exhibits a fusiform dUatation, the ventrtculus terminalis:* this has a vertical measurement of from eight to ten miUimetres, is trianguhir on cross section with its base directed fonvards, and tends to undergo obliteration after the age ^Throughout the cervical and thoracic regions the central canal is situated in the anterior third of the cord : in the lumbar enlargenient it is near the middle, and in the conus medul- laris it approaches the posterior surface, it is filled with cerebro-siDinal flmd.and is hned by ciUated, columnar epithelium, outside which is an encirclmg band of S^^^V-^""1.^",^^; Ihuo s substantia gelatinosa centralis This ge atino s substance consists mainb^ °* rT^'« contains a few nerve ceUs and fibres . it s traversed by processes from the deep ends of Jhe columnar ciUated ceUs which line the central ^^"iti^StSe^ofthe greymatter.-Thegi.y n.atter consists of "^urogha, together i i numerous nerve-ceUs ai^d nerve-fibres Thi^^^^^ out the greater part of the g^ey' 'natter t^ie neuroglia presents the appearance of a sponge C.8.

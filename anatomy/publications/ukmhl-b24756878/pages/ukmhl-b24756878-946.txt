928 NEUROLOGY One set of fibres forms the vestibular root of the nerve, and arises from the cells in the oanglion of Scarpa which is situated in the internal auditory meatus ; the other set c°onstitutes the cochlear root, and takes origin from the cells in the cran^lion spirale or ganghon of Corti, which occupies the spiral canal of the cljcWea. Both of these ganglia consist of bipolar nerve-cells ; one process from each of the cells passes inwards to the brain, the other outwards to the internal ear. At its connection with the brain the eighth nerve occupies the gi-oove between the pons and medulla, where it is situated between the restiform body which is behind, and the seventh nerve which is in front. Vestibular root (radix vestibularis) (fig. 781).—The fibres of this root enter the medulla to the inner side of those of the cochlear root, and pass between the restiform body which is to their outer side, and the inferior sensory root of the fifth which lies to their inner side. They then divide mto an ascending and a descending set. The fibres of the latter end by arborising round the cells of the internal nucleus, which is situated in the trigonum acusticum m the floor of the fourth ventricle. The ascending fibres either end in the same manner or in the external nucleus, which is situated to the outer side of the trigonum acusticum and farther from the ven- FiG 781-Terminal nuclei of the vestibular root of tricular floor. It is described the auditory nerve, with their upper connections. as consisting of two parts ;LWc.I (Testut.) S.«':n t£ nucleus of Bechterew. Some of the axons of the cells of the external nucleus, and possibly also of the mternal nucleus, are continued up- wards through the restiform body to the roof nuclei of the opposite side of the cere- bellum, to which also other fibres of the vestibular root are prolonged ^vithout inter- ruption in the nuclei of the medulla. A second set of fibres from the internal and external nuclei end partly in the tegmentum, while the remainder ascend in the pos- terior longitudinal bundle to arborise around the cells of the nuclei of the oculo-motor nerve. Cochlear root (radix cochlearis) (fig. 782).—TMs part of the nerve is placed external to the vestibular root.

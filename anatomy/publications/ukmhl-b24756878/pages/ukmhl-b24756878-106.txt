The entoderm consists at first of flattened cells, which subsequently become columnar. It forms the epithelial lining of the whole of the alimentary canal excepting part of the mouth and pharynx and the terminal part of the rectum (which are hned by involutions of the ectoderm), the Uning cells of all the glands Fig. 108.—A series of transverse sections through an embryo of the dog.

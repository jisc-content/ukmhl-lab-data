84 EMBRYOLOGY additional spermatozoa. OccasionaUy a second spermatozoon may enter the vitellus thus eiving rise to a condition of polys-permy : when this occurs the ovum usuallv develops in an abnormal manner and gives rise to a monstrosity Havins pierced the Aatellus, the spermatozoon loses its tail, wlule its head and connecting piece assume the form of a nucleus contaimng a cluster of chromo- somes This constitutes the male pronucleus, and associated with it there are a centrosome and attraction sphere. The male pronucleus pa^es more deeply into the ^dtellus, and coincident with this the granules of the cytoplasm surrounding it become radially arranged. The male and female pronuclei migrate toxs-^ds each other, and, meeting near the centre of the vitellus, fuse to form a new nucleus the segrneMation nuoMs, which therefore contains both niale and female nuclea substance • the former transmits the individuahties of the male ancestors the attS those of the female ancestors, to the future embryo. By the union of the male and female pronuclei the number of chromosomes is restored to that which is present in the nuclei of the somatic cells. SEGMENTATION OF THE FERTILISED OVUM After it has been fertilised the ovum undergoes repeated subdivision into a nuX of small cells (figs. 100, 101). The segmentation nucleus exhibits the u^ual mitotic changes, and these are succeeded by a division of the ovum i^to two eel s S nearirequal size.* The process is repeated again and agam, so that,the two Fig lOO.-First stages of segmentation of a mammuUan ovum : semi-diagrammatic. ^ (From a drawing by Allen Thomson.) ...ZonapeU... ...

1015 THE EYE to the sclera. It is tliicker behind than in front. Externally, it is loosely connected by the lamma fusca mth the inner sui'face of the sclera. Its inner surface is attached to the pigmented layer of the retina. Structure.—The choroid consists mainly of a dense capillary plexus, and of small arteries and veins carrying blood to and returning it fi-om this plexus. On its external surface, i.e. the sui-face next the sclera, is -pio, 834.—The choroid and iris. (Enlarged.) a thin membrane, the lamina suprachorioidea, composed of delicate non-vascular lamellaj —each lamella consisting of a network of fine elastic fibres among wliich are branched pigment-cells. The spaces between the lameUse are Imed by endothelium, and open freely into the perichoroidal lymph-space, which, in its turn, communicates Avith the periscleral space by the perforations in the sclera through wliich the vessels and nerves are transmitted. Internal to this lamina is the choroid 'proper, and in con- sequence of the small arteries and veins being arranged on the outer surface of the capil- lary network, it is customary to describe this as consisting of two layers : an outer, composed of small arteries and veins, with pigment-cells interspersed between them ; and an inner, consisting of a capillary plexus. The outer layer or lamina vasculosa consists, in part, of the larger branches of the short ciliary arteries which run forwards between the veins, before they bend inwards to terminate in the capillaries, but is formed principally of veins, Fig. 835.—^The arteries of the choroid and iris. The greater part of the sclera has been removed. (Enlarged.) named, from their arrangement, tiie venoe. vorlicosce. They converge to four or five equidistant trunks, which pierce the sclera midway between the margin of the cornea and the entrance of the optic nerve. Interspersed between the vessels are dark star-shaped pigment-cells, the processes of which, communicating

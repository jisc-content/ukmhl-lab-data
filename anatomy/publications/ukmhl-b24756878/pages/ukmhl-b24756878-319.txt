301 ULNA involve the articular surface. Those which do not involve the joint are the transverse fracture above the epiconclyles, and the so-called epitrochlear fracture, where the tip of the internal epicondylc is broken off, generally from direct violence. The Ulna The Ulna (figs. 358 and 359) is a long bone, prismatic in form, placed at the inner side of tlie forearm, parallel with the radius. Its upper extremity, of oreat thickness and strength, forms a large part of the articulation of the elbow-joint; the bone diunnishes in size from above downwards, its lower extremity being very small, and excluded from the wist-joint by the interposition of an interarticular fibro-cartilage. It is divisible into a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity (fig. 357), the strongest part of the bone, presents two curved processes, the olecranon jjrocess and the coronoid process ; and two concave, articular cavities, the greater and lesser sigmoid cavities. The olecranon process (olecranon) is a large, thick, curved eminence .situated at the upper and back part of the ulna. It is bent foi'wards at the summit so as to present a promment lip which is received into the olecranon fossa in extension of the forearm. Its base is contracted where it ioins the shatt; this is the narrowest part Fig. 357.—Upper extremitj' of left ulna. Outer aspect. Olecranon process Coronoid 2>rocess of the upper end of the ulna, and, consequently, the most usual seat of fracture. Its posterior surface, directed backwards, is triangular, smooth, subcutaneous, and covered by a bursa. Its superior sttrface is of quadi-ilateral form, marked beliind by a rough impression for the inser- tion of the Triceps muscle ; and in front, near the margin, by a slight transverse groove for the attach- ment of part of the posterior liga- ment of the elbow-joint. Its an- terior surface is smooth, concave, covered with cartilage in the recent state, and forms the upper and back part of the greater sigmoid cavity. Its lateral borders present continua- tions of the gi-oove on the margin of the superior surface ; they serve for the attachment of ligaments— viz. the back part of the internal lateral ligament internally, and the posterior ligament externally. From the inner border a part of the Flexor carpi ulnaris arises ; while to the outer border the Anconeus is attached. nrowfin^T"°'^.Pn°'^f^^ (processus coronoideus) is a triangular eminence rtXi lionzontally forwards from the upper and front part of the ulna, fhat ?r«otfr '""^ ^^^^.^}^^% and of considerable strength ; so much .so sltht V ^nrv..? r '^'^ occurrence.

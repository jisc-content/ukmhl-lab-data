1204 SPLANCHNOLOGY the influence of cold, and in the young and robust, it is short, corrugated, and closely applied to the testes. The scrotum consists of two layers, the integument and the dartos. The integument is very thin, of a brownisli colour, and generally thrown into folds or rugte. It is provided with sebaceous follicles, the secretion of which has a peculiar odoui-, and is beset with thinly scattered, crisp hairs, the roots of \\'hich are seen through the skin. The dartos (tunica dartos) is a thin layer of non-striped muscular fibres, and is continuous, around the base of the scrotum, with the two layers of the superficial fascia of the groin and of the perinseum, and sends inwards a septum, septum scroti, which divides the scrotal pouch into two cavities for the testes, the septum extending between the raphe and the under surface of the penis, as far as its root.

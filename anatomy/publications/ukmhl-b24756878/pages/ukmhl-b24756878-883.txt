865 INTERIOR OF THE CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES Interior of the Cerebral Hemispheres If the upper part of either liemisphere be removed with a knife, at a level about half an incli above the corpus callosuni, the internal white matter will be exposed. It is an oval-shaped centre of white substance surrounded by a narrow convoluted margin of gi-ey matter of almost uniform thickness. The white central mass has been called the centrum ovale mimis. Its surface is studded with numerous minute red dots (puncta vasculosa), produced by the escape of blood from divided blood-vessels ; in inflammation or great congestion of the brain these are very numerous, and of a dark colour. If the remaining portions of the hemispheres be sHghtly dra^\■n apart a broad band of white substance M-ill be observed, connecting them at the bottom of the longitudinal fissm-e ; this .is the corpus callosum. The margins of the hemispheres which Fig. 733.—Corpus callosum from above. eonl^f ^ caUed the foftm cerebri.

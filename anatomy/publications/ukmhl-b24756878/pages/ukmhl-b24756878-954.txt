936 NEUROLOGY the muscles and mucous membrane of the pharynx and the muscles of the soft palate, except the Tensor palati. A minute filament descends and joins the hypoglossal nerve as it -winds round the occipital artery. The superior laryngeal nerve (n. laryngeus superior) is larger than the preceding, and arises from the middle of the ganglion of the trunk, in its course it receives a branch from the superior cervical ganglion ot the sympathetic. It descends, by the side of the pharynx, behind the internal carotid artery and divides into two" branches, the external and internal laryngeal. Tiie external laryngeal branch (ramus externus), the smaUer, descends on the larynx, beneath the Sterno-thyroid, to supply the Crico-thyroid muscle, it gives branches to the pharyngeal plexus and the Inferior constrictor and com- municates with the superior cardiac nerve, behmd the common carotid artery The internal laryngeal branch (ramus internus) descends to the thyro-hyoid membrane, pierces it in company mth the superior laryngeal artery, and is distributed to the mucous membrane of the larynx. A smaU branch com- municates with the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Of the branches to the mucous membrane some are distributed to the epiglottis, the base of thie tongue and the epiglottic glands ; while others pass backwards, in the aryteno-epiglott c fold to supply the mucous membrane surroundmg the superior orihce ot the arynx? and^hat lining the cavity of the larynx as low do.-n ^^ f e vocal cord. The filament which joins with the recurrent aryngeal descends beneath the mucous membrane on the inner surface of the thyi-oid cartilage, where the two nerves become united. ^diArl frnm The inferior or recurrent laryngeal nerve (n. recurrens), so called from its reflected course, is the motor nerve of the larynx.

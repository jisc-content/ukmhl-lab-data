MUSCLES AND FASCIJ2 OF THE UROGENITAL REGION 625 Between the muscles just examined a triangular space exists, bounded internally bv the Accelerator urinae, externally by the Erector penis, and behind by the Trans- v'ersus perinsei. The floor of this space is formed by the triangular ligament of the urethra (deep perineal fascia), and running from behind forwards in it are the superficial perineal vessels and nerves, and the long pudendal nerve. The transverse perineal artery courses along the posterior boundary of the space on tlie Transversus perinaji. The deep fascia of the urogenital region forms an investment for the Compressor urethras, but within it lie also the deep vessels and nerves of this part, the whole forming a transverse septum which is known as the Fig. 515.â€”Muscles of male perinseum. dtaphragma urogenitale. Prom its shape it is usually termed the triangular ligament, and it is stretched almost horizontally across the pubic arch, so as to close in the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. It consists of two dense membranous laminae, which are united along their posterior borders, but are separated in front by intervening structures. The superficial of these two layers, the inferior layer of the triangular ligament (fascia diaphi-agmatica uro- genitaHs inferior), is triangular in shape, and about an inch and a half in depth. Its apex is directed forw-ards, and is sejjarated from the subpubic ligament by an oval opening for the transmission of the dorsal vein of the penis. Its lateral margins are attached on either side to the rami of the pubis and

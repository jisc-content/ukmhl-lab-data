1201 THE MALE URETHRA Fig. 999.—The male urethra, laid open on its anterior (upper) sui-face. (Testut.) Veru- montanum Prostate Cowper's gland Bulb Cms Corpus spongiosu n arch, from which it is separated by the dorsal vessels and nerves of the penis, and some muscular fibres. Its posterior convex surface is separated from the rectum by a triangular space, which constitutes the perinseum. The membranous portion of the urethra lies between the inferior and superior layers of the triangular ligament. As it pierces the inferior layer, the fibres around the opening are pro- longed over the tube. It is surrounded by the Compressor lu'ethrse muscle. The spongy portion (pars cavernosa) (figs. 992, 999) is the longest part of the urethra, and is contained in the corpus spongiosum. It is about six inches in length, and extends from the termination of the membranous portion to the meatus urinarius. Commenc- ing just below the triangular ligament, it passes forwards for a short distance ; and then, in the flaccid condition of the penis, it bends downwards and forwards. It is narrow, and of uniform size in- the body of the penis, measuring about a quarter of an inch in diameter; it is dilated behind, ^-itliin the bulb, and again anteriorly within the glans penis, where it forms the fossa navicitlaris urethrce. The bulbous 'portion is a name sometimes given to the posterior part of the spongy portion contained within the bulb. The meatus urinarius (orificium urethrse externum) is the most contracted part of the urethra ; it is a vertical slit, about a quarter of an inch in length, bounded on each side by two small labia. Tlie inner surface of the lining membrane of tlie urethi-a, especially on the floor of the spongy portion, presents the orifices of numerous mucous glands and follicles situated in the submucous tissue, and named the glands of Litlre. Besides these there are a number of small pit-like recesses, or lacunce, of varying sizes. Their orifices are directed forwards, so that they may easily intercept lo^l^^i? i.'^ Its passage along the canal.

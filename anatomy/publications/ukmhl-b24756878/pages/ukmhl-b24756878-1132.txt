SPLANCHNOLOGY 11M from tlie under surface of tlie skull to the level of the cricoid cartilage in front, and that of the sixtli cervical vertebra beliind. The cavity of the pharynx (cavum pharyngis) is about five inches in lengtli, and broader in tlie transverse than in the antero-posterior diameter. Its m-eatcst breadth is immediately below the base of the skull, where it projects on either side, beliind the orifice of the Eustachian tube, as a recess termed the fossa of Rosenmuller ; its narrowest point is at its termination in tlie oesophagus. It is limited, above, by the body of the sphenoid and Ijasilar process °of the occipital bone ; below, it is continuous with the oesophagus ; posteriorly, it is connected by loose areolar tissue with the cervical portion of the vertebral column, and the Longus colli and Rectus capitis anticus muscles ; anteriorly, it is incomplete, and is attached in succession to the internal ptery<^oid plate, pterygo-mandibular ligament, mandible, tongue, hyoid bone, and thyroid and cricoid cartilages ; laterally, it is connected to the styloid processes and their muscles, and is in contact with the common and internal carotid arteries, the internal jugular veins, and the glosso-pharyngeal, pneu- mogastric, hypoglossal, and sympathetic nerves, and above \\^th a small part of the Internal pterygoid muscles. Seven opemngs commumcate with it, viz the two posterior nares, the two Eustachian tubes, the mouth the larynx, and the oesophagus. The cavity of the phafynx may be subdivided from above downwards into three parts : nasal, oral, and laryngeal (fag. 899). The nasal part, or naso-pharynx (pars nasaUs), lies behind the no.se and above the level of the soft palate : it differs from the two lower parts of the tube in that its cavity always remains patent. In front it commumcates through the choante mth the nasal fossae. On its lateral wall is the pharyjigeal orifice of the Eustachian tube (ostium pharyngeum tubse), somewhat triangular in shape, and bounded behind by a firm prominence, the cushion (torus tubarius), caused by the inner extremity of the cartilage of the tube which devates the mucous membrane. A vertical fold of mucous membrane, the plica salpingopharyngea, stretches from the lower part of the cushion ft contains the Salpingo-pharyngeus muscle A second and ^^^f Jf^^^ the plica salpingopalatina, stretches from the upper part of the cushion to the palate Behind the orifice of the Eustac uan tube is a deep recess the fossa of Rosenmiiller (recessus pharyngeus), which represents the remains of the upper part of the second visceral cleft. On the posterior wall is a prominence, best marked in childhood, P^'of^f ^ b^ a mass of lym^^^^^ tistue, which is known as the pharyngeal tonsil (^onsiUa pha™^^^ the pharyngeal tonsil, in the middle hue, an irregular flask-slmped depre^jio^^ Kg^SdU'LuschL as the remains of the ^^jj^t^e^trof^^ Fig. 920.—Section of tonsil. terior lobe of the pituitar\ body.

EMBRYOLOGY 170 Fig. 234.—Urogenital sinus of female human embryo of eight and a half to nine weeks old. Milllerian ducts two parts are at first quite distinct, but become combined in tlie process of develop- ment. The suprarenal bodies are at first larger than the kidneys ; about the tenth week they equal them in size, and from that time decrease relatively to the kidneys, though they remain, throughout foetal hfe, proportionately much larger than in the adult. . r ,i j i. The Micllerian fZitcts.—Shortly after the formation of the Wolthan ducts a second pair of ducts is developed ; these are named the Miillerian ducts. Each arises on the outer aspect of the corresponding Wolfiian body as a tubular invagi- nation of the cells Hning the coelom (fig. 231). The orifice of the mvagination remains patent, and undergoes enlargement and modification to form the abdominal ostium of the Fallopian tube. The ducts pass backwards on the outer aspects of the Wolffian bodies, but towards the posterior end of the embryo they cross to the inner side of the Wolffian ducts, and thus come to he side by side between and behind the latter—the four ducts forming what is termed the genital Ultfmately, the Miillerian ducts open into the ventral part of the cloaca between the orifices of the Wolffian ducts, and terminate on an elevation named the Miillerian eminence (fig. 234). Berry Hart describes them as ending bhndly on *^\n°th^ male the Miillerian ducts atrophy, but traces of their anterior ends are represented by the sessile hydatids of the epididymis, while their terminal fused ^ portions form the uterus mascuhnus or smus pocularis in the floor of the prostatic portion of the urethra (fig. 235, c). In the female the Miillerian ducts persist and undergo further development. The portions which He in the genital cord fuse to form the uterus and vagina; the parts in front of this cord remain separate, and each forms the corresponding Fallopian tube—the abdominal ostium of which is developed from the anterior extremity of the original tubular invagination from the ccBlom (fig. 235, b). The fusion of the Miillerian ducts begins in the third month, and the septum formed by their fused mes- ial walls disappears from below upwards, and thus the cavities of the vagina and uterus are produced. About the fifth month an annular constriction marks the position of the neck of the uterus and after the sixth month the walls of but Wood Jones (op. cit.) maintains that no such septum exists, and that th. «l„f2 th^;rog?MtaUiU at its uppev part (««• fv.f^.^' ^ open at the hind-end of the vagina, and for » <><''«''1=™'" " '/ ' N„ tunnel a new passage to the hind-end.

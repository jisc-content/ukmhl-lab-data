EMBRYOLOGY 86 differentiated into two strata : an outer, termed the symylium^oT f asirwdtohlmt, so named because it consists of a layer of protoplasm studded with nuclei, but showing no evidence of subdivision into cells ; and an inner layer offpnsmatic epithelmm, which is named the cytoblast or layer of Langhans. As already^stated, the cells of the trophoblast do not contribute to the formation of the embrvo proper • they form the ectoderm of the chorion and play an important part in the development of the placenta. On the inner surface of the mner cell-mass a layer of flattened cells, the entoderm, is differentiated and qmckly assumes the fonn of a Fig 104 —Section through embryonic area of Vespertilio murinus (after van Beneden) to show the formation of the amniotic cavity.

915 FIFTH CRANIAL NERVE and supply the dura mater. The posterior branch also supplies the mucous lining of the mastoid cells. The anterior branch communicates with the meningeal branch of the superior maxillary nerve. The nerve to the internal pterygoid (n. pterygoideus internus), given off from the inferior maxillary before it divides, is intimately connected at its origin with the otic ganglion. It is a slender branch, which passes inwards and enters the deep surface of the Internal pterygoid. The anterior and smaller division, wliicli receives nearly the whole of the motor root, divides into branches which supply the muscles of mastication and the skin and mucous membrane of the cheek. They are the masseteric, deep temporal, long buccal, and external pterygoid. The masseteric branch (n. massetericus) passes outwards, above the External pterygoid, m front of the temporo-mandibular articulation, and behind Eio. 772.â€”The External pterygoid muscle and the branches of the inferior maxillary nerve in relation to it. Auriculo-temporal Temporal the tendon of the Temporal; it crosses the sigmoid notch with the masseteric artery, to the deep surface of the Masseter, in which it ramifies nearly as far as Its anterior border. It gives a filament to the temporo-mandibular joint. ihe deep temporal branches (nn. temporales profundi) are two in number anterior and posterior. They pass above the upper border of the External pterygoid and enter the deep surface of the Temporal. The posterior branch, of small size, is placed at the back of the temporal fossa. It sometimes arises m common with the masseteric branch. The anterior branch is frequentlv given off with the buccal nerve, and then turns upwards over the upper head i's present pterygoid. Frequently a third branch (middle deep temporal) The long buccal branch (n. buccinatorius) passes forwards between the two heads of the External pterygoid, and downwards beneath or through 3 N 2

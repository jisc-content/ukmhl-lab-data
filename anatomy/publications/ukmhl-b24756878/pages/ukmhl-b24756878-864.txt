846 NEUROLOGY is continued externally into an oval swelling, the external geniculate body, while beneath the pulvinar, but separated by the superior brachiuni, is a second oval swelling, the internal geniculate body. , , , , The sitperior surface is free, sliglitly convex, and covered by a layer of white matter, termed the stratum zonule. It is separated externally from the caudate nucleus by a white band named the taenia semicircularis, and by the win of the corpus striatum. It is divided into an inner and an outer portion bv an oblique shallow furrow which runs from behmd for\\ards and inwardn and corresponds with the outer margin of the fornix. The part on the outer side of the furrow forms a portion of the floor of the lateral ventricle, and is covered by the epithelial lining of this cavity. The part on the inner side is covered by the velum interpositum, and excluded from the lateral and 7ig. Coronal seotion of brain immediately in front of pons.

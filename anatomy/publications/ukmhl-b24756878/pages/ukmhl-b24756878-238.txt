OSTEOLOGY 220 week of icehi] life. Ossification gradually extends in a radial manner from tfie centre towards the margins of the bone ; the angles are consequently the parts last formed, and it is here that the fontanelles exist. Occasionallv the parietal bone is cUvided into two parts, upper and lower, by an antero-nosterior suture Articulations.—The parietal articulates with five bones: the opposite parietal the occipital, frontal, temporal, and sphenoid. The Frontal Bone The frontal bone (os frontale) resembles a cockle-shell m form, and consists of two portions—a frontal or vertical portion corresponding with the region of the forehead ; and an orbital or horizontal portion, which enters into the formation of the roofs of the orbits and nasal fossee. Frontal or vertical portion (squama frontalis).—The external surface (fig. 290) of this portion is convex and usually exliibits, in the lower pari of the middle line, the remains of the frontal or metopic suture ; in infancy this suture divides the bone into right and left halves, a condition which mav Fig. 290.—Frontal bone. Outer sui-face. persist thi-oughout life. On either side of this suture, a little more than an inch above the supra-orbital margin, is a rounded elevation, the frontal eminence (tuber frontale). These eminences vary in size in different individuals, arc occasionally un.symmetrical, a)\d are especially prominent in young .skulls ; the surface of the bone above them is smooth, and covered by the aponeurosis of the Occipito-frontalis. Below the frontal eminences, and separated from them by a shallow groove, are t-wo arched elevations, the superciliary ridges (arcus superciliarcs); these are prominent internally, and ai-e joined across the middle line by a smooth elevation named tlie glabeila. These ridges are larger in the male than in the female, and their degree of prominence dejiends to

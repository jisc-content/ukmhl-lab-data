INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY 651 a ad supplies the caudate nucleus and the thalamus. One artery of this groiip is of larger size than the rest, and is of special importance, as being the artery in the brain most frequently ruptured ; it has been termed by Charcot, the ' artery Fig. 585.—Mesial surface of cerebral hemisphere, showing areas supplied by cerebral arteries. Anterior cerebral, blue ; middle cerebral, red ; posterior cerebral, yellow. of cerebral hcemorrhage.' It passes up between the lenticular nucleus and the external capsxile, and ultimately ends in the caudate nucleus. The inferior external frontal supplies the third or inferior frontal convolution (Broca's convolution) and Fig. 586.—Upper surface of cerebral Fig. 587.— Under sui-face of cerebral hemisphere, shomng areas supplied by hemisphere, showing areas supplied by cerebral arteries. cerebral arteries.

The ascending frontal supplies the ascending frontal convolution. The ascending parietal is distributed to the ascending parietal and the lower part of the superior parietal convolutions.

SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY 691 iliac fossa, where, considerably diminished in size, it anastomoses with one of its own branches, viz. the ileo-colic. In its course it forms an arch, the convexity of which is directed forwards and downwards to the left side. Fig. 605.â€”The superior mesenteric artery and its branches. the concavity backwards and upwards to the right. It is accompanied by tlie superior mesenteric vem, which lies to its right side, and it is surrounded by the superior mesenteric plexus of nerves. Its branches are : Inferior pancreatico-duodenal. Ileo-colic. Vasa intestini tenuis. Right colic. Middle colic. The inferior pancreatico-duodenal (a. pancreaticoduodenalis inferior) is given oti trom the superior mesenteric or from its first intestinal branch, opposite the upper border of the third part of the duodenum. It courses to the right between the neacl of the pancreas and duodenum, and then ascends to anastomose vdth the superior pancreatico-duodenal artery. It distributes branches to the head of the pancreas and to the second and third portions of the duodenum. ilie vasa intestini tenuis (aa. intestiuales) arise from the convex side of the superior mesenteric artery. They are usually from twelve to fifteen in number, and are distributed to the jejunum and ileum. They run parallel with one another between the layers of the mesentery, each vessel dividing into two branches, w ucti umte with adjacent branches, forming a series of arches, the convexities of wuicii are directed towards the intestine. From this first set of arches branches Y Y 2

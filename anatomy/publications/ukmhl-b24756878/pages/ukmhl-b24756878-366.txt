OSTEOLOGY 348 The posterior surface is the space iacluded between the postero-external and the postero-internal borders ; it is continuous below with the triangular surface above the articular facet of tlie outer malleolus ; it is directed back- wards above, backwards and inwards at its middle, directly inwards below . Its upper third is rough, for the origm of the Soleus ; its lower part presents a triangular surface, connected to the tibia by a strong interosseous ligament; the intervening part of the surface is covered by the fibres of origm of the Flexor longus hallucis. Near the middle of this surface is the meduUary foramen, which is directed downwards. The internal surface is the interval included between the antero-mternal and the postero-mternai borders. It is grooved for the origin of the Tibialis posticus. The external surface is the space between the antero-external and postero- external borders. It is much broader than the preceding, and often deeply arooved : it is directed outwards m the upper two-thirds of its course, back- wards in the lower third, where it is contmuous J^J^^^X^^^^^ Fig. 400.—^Lower extremity of right fibula.

The lower extremity, or external malleolus (malleolus lateralis), is of a pyramidal form, some- what flattened from with- out inwards, and is longer, and descends lower, than the internal malleolus. The external surface is convex, subcutaneous, and con- tinuous with the trian- gular, subcutaneous surface on the outer side of the shaft. The internal surface (fig. 400) presents in front a smooth triangular facet (facies articularis malleoli), broader above than below, and convex from above downwards, which articu- lates with a corresponding surface on the out«r side of the astragalus.

Ossification begins m the shaft aboiit t o eighth week of foetal Ufe, a httle later than in the tibia, and extends towards t e xTremities.

70 HISTOLOGY Miilpighian layer of the epidermis, and resembles it in the rounded form and soft character of its cells ; at the bottom of the hair-follicle these cells become con- tinuous with those of the root of the hair. The inner root-sheath consists of: (1) a delicate cuticle next the hair, composed of a thin layer of imbricated scales having a downward direction, so that they fit accurately over the upwardly directed imbricated scales of the hair itself; (2) one or two layers of horny, flattened, nucleated cells, known as Huxley's layer ; and (3) a single layer of homy oblong cells without visible ]iuclei, called Henle's layer. The hair-follicle contains the root of the hair, which terminates in a bulbous extremity, and is excavated so as to fit exactly the papilla from M'hich it grows. The bulb is composed of polyhedral epithelial cells, wliich as they pass upwards into the root of the hair become elongated and spindle-shaped, except some m the centre which remain polyhedral. Some of these latter cells contain pigment granules which give rise to the colour of the hair. It occasionally happens that these pic^meut granules completely fill the cells in the centre of the bulb ; this ^ ° gives rise to the dark tract Fro. 88.-Transverse section of hair-follicle. of pigment often Jound, of greater or less length, in the axis of the hair. The shaft of the hair con- sists of a central pith or medulla, an intermediate fibrous part, and the cuticle externally. The jnecZw//a occu- pies the centre of the shaft and ceases towards the point of the hair. It is usually wanting in the fine hairs covering the surface of the body, and commonly in those of the head. It 'is more opaque and deeper coloured when -^dewed by transmitted light than the fibrous part; but when viewed by reflected fight it is white. It is com- posed of rows of polyhedral cells, which contain granules of eleidin and frequently air-spaces. The fibrous por- tion of the hair constitutes the chief part of the shaft; its cells are elongated and unite to form flattened fusi- form fibres. Between the fibres are found minute spaces which contain pigment granules in dark hair, and By aline layer-- Fibrous part fi^s of hair Henle's layer Outer or — dermic coat minute air-spaces contained in the in white hair.

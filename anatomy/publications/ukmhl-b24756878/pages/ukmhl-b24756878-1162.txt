SPLANCHNOLOGY 1144 ducts enter the intestine, they are very large and closely approximated. In the transverse portion of the duodenum and upper half of the jejunum they are large and numerous, but from this point, down to the middle of the ileum, they diminish considerably in size. In the lower part of the ileum they almost entirely disappear ; hence the comparative thinness of this portion of the intestine, as compared with the duodenum and jejunum. The valvule conniventes retard the passage of the food along the intestines, and afford an increased surface for absorption. The villi {villi intestinales) are highly vascular processes, projecting from the mucous membrane of the small intestine throughout its wliole extent, and giving to its surface a velvety appearance. They are largest and most numerous in the duodenum and jejunum, and become fewer and smaller in the ileum. Structure of the villi (figs. 942, 943).—The essential parts of a villus are: the lacteal vessel, the blood-vessels, the epithelium, the basement-membrane, and muscular tissue of the mucosa, all being supported and held together by retiform lymphoid tissue.

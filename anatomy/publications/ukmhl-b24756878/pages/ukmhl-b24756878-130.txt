The nasal cavity becomes divided into the two nasal foss^ by a vertical septum, which extends downwards and backwards from the fronto-nasal ^ricei and nasal lamina, and unites below with the palatal processes.

The anterior part of this persists as the septal cartilage of the nose, but the posterior and upper parts are replaced by the vomer and mesethmoid.

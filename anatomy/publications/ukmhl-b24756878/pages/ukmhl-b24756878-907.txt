MOTOR TRACT 889 tliree-fourths of the fibres decussate in the medulla and the remainder in the cord. Tlie axons of the motor cells in the anterior horn pass out as the fibres of the anterior roots of the spinal nerves, along which the impulses are conducted to the muscles of the trunk and limbs. From this it will be seen that all the fibres of the motor tract pass to the nuclei of the motor nerves on the opposite side of the brain or cord, a fact Fig. 754.—The motor tract. (Modified from Poirier.) Motor area of cortex Geniculate fibres Internal capsule Decussation of pyramids Direct pyramidal tract Crossed pyramidal tract \ — Anterior nerve roots which explains why a lesion m volving the motor area of one side causes paralysis ot the muscles of the opposite side of the body. Turther, it will be seen that tliere is a break in the continuity of the motor cham: in the case of the cranial nerves this break occurs in the nuclei of these nerves; and m the case of the spmal nerves, m the anterior horn of grey matter. For cUnical purposes it is con- venient to emphasise this break and divide the motor tract into two portions : U) a series of upper motor neurons which comprises the motor cells in the

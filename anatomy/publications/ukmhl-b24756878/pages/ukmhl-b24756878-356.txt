The cancelli in the ends of the femur are disposed along the hues of greatest pressure and tension. In the upper end (fig 391) the chief lamellae are arranged m the foUowiug manner. A senes of bony planes at right angles to the articular surface of the head converge to a central dense wedge, which presents few and dense cancelU. The wedge is supported by strong lamellaj, which extend to the sides of the neck and arc specially marked along its upper and lower borders.

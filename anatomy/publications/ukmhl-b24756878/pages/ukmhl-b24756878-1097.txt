It is nan-ow above, but u?dens out a little below, and, owing to the obhque course taken by the left pleuia it is directed from above downwards and to the le t. Its anterior wall Fs fo -med by the left Triangularis sterni muscle and the fifth, sixth, and seventh left costal cartilages. It contains a quantity of loose areolar tissue, some Fig. 892.—Transverse section through the upper margin of the second thoracic vertebra. (Braune.) Lt. carotid . Left innommale vein art.

The middle mediastinum is the broadest part of the interpleural space. It contains the heart enclosed in the pericardium, the ascending aorta, the lower half of the superior vena cava with the vena azygos major opening into it, the bifurcation of the trachea and the two bronchi, the pulmonary artery dividing into its two branches, the right and left pulmonary veins, the phrenic nerves, and some bronchial lymphatic glands. The posterior mediastinum (fig. 893) is an irregular triangular space running parallel mth the vertebral column; it is bounded m front by the pericardium above, and by the posterior surface of the Diaphragm below, behind by the vertebral column from the lower border of the fourth to the twelfth thoracic vertebra, and on either side by the pleura. It contains the descending thoracic aorta, the yen£e azygos major and minor, the pneumo- gastric and splanchnic nerves, the oesophagus, the thoracic duct, and some lymphatic glands.

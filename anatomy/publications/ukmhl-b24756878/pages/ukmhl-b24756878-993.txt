Front view. ligament, into the thigh, where it becomes somewhat flattened, and divides into an anterior and a posterior part. Under Poupai't's Uga- ment, it is separated from the femoral artery by a portion of the Psoas. Within the abdomen the anterior crural nerve gives off from its outer side some small branches to the Iliacus, and a branch to the femoral artery, which is distributed upon the upper part of tliat vessel. The origin of this branch varies: it occa- sionally arises higher than usual, or it may arise lower down in the thigh. In the thigh the following branches are given oft' : From the Anterior Division Middle cutaneous. Internal cutaneous. Muscular. From the Posterior Division Long saphenous. Muscular. Articular. The middle cutaneous nerve (fig. 806) pierces the fascia lata (and generally the Sartorius) about three Indies below Poupart's liga- ment, and divides into two branches (rami cutanei an- teriores) which descend in immediate proximity along tiio fore part of the thigii, to supply the integument as low as the front of tlie knee. Here they communicate with the internal cutaneous nerve and the patellar branch of the internal saphenous, to form the patellar plexus. In the upper part of the thigh the outer division of tlie middle cutaneous communicates with tlie crural branch of the genito-crural nerve.

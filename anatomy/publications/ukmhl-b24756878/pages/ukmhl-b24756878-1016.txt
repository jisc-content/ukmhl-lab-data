998 NEUROLOGY splanclinic nerves, a ganglion being formed at the point of junction with the latter nerve. The plexus suppUes the suprarenal gland, being distributed chiefly to its medullary portion ; its branches are remarkable for their large size in comparison with that of the organ they supply. The renal plexus (plexus renaUs) is formed by filaments from the solar plexus, the lower part of the semilunar ganglion (aortico-renal ganglion), and the aortic plexus. It is joined also by the smallest splanchnic nerve. The nerves from these sources, fifteen or twenty in number, have numerous ganglia developed upon them. They accompany the branches of the renal Fia. 820.—The semilunar ganglia wth the sympathetic plexuses of the abdominal viscera radiating from the ganglia. (From Toldt's ' Atlas,' published by Messrs.

642 ANGIOLOGY by the Stylo-hyoid muscle and the posterior belly of the Digastric. It is covered by the integument, superficial fascia, Platysma, and deep fascia ; ramifying in which are branches of the facial and superficial cervical nerves. Its floor is formed by parts of the ThjTO-hyoid, Hyo-glossus, and the Inferior and Middle constrictor muscles of the pharynx. This space when dissected is seen to contain the upper part of the common carotid artery, which bifur- cates opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage into the external and internal carotid. These vessels are somewhat concealed from view by the anterior margin of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, which overlaps them. The external and internal carotids lie side by side, the external being the more anterior of the two. The foUowmg branches of the external carotid are also met with in this space : the superior thyroid, running forwards and downwards ; the lingual, directly forwards ; the facial, forwards and upwards ; the occipital, backwards ; and the ascenduig pharyngeal, directly upwards on the inner side of the internal carotid. The vems met with are : the mterna iugular which hes on the outer side of the common and internal carotid arteries'- and vems corresponding to the above-mentioned branches of the external carotid—viz. the superior thyi-oid, the lingual, facial, ascending pharyngeal, and sometimes the occipital—all of wliich accompany their corre- sponding arteries, and terminate in the internal jugular. The nerves in this space are the following. In front of the sheath of the common carotid is the descendens hypoglossi. The hypoglossal nerve crosses both the mternal and external carotids above, curving round the origm of the occipital artery Within the sheath, between the artery and vem, and behind both, is tlie pneumogastric nerve; behind the sheath, the sympathetic On the outer side of the vessels, the spinal accessory nerve runs for a short distance betoie it pierces the Sterno-mastoid muscle ; and on the inner side of the external carotid lust below the hyoid bone, may be seen the mternal laryngeal nerve ; and, still more ixiferiorly, the external laryngeal nerve.

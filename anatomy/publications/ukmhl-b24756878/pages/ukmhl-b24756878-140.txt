122 EMBRYOLOGY Fig. 155.—Brain of human embryo of four and a half weeks, showing interior of fore-brain. (From model by His.) corpora quadrigemina. The dorsal part of the wall for a time undergoes expansion, and presents an interior median farrow and a corresponding surface ridge ; these, however, disappear, and the latter is replaced by a groove. Subsequently two oblique furrows extend inwards and baclcwards, and the thickened lamina is thus subdi\ddcd into the quadrigeminal bodies. The fore-brain.—A transverse section of the early fore-brain shows the same parts as are displayed in similar sections of the spinal cord and medulla oblongata, viz. : a pair of thick lateral walls connected by thin floor and roof plates. Moreover each lateral wall exhibits a division into a dorsal or alar and a ventral or basal lamina separated internally by a furrow termed the sulcus of Monro. This sulcus ends anteriorly at the inner extremity of the optic stalk, and in the adult brain is retained as a shght groove extending backwards from the foramen of Monro to the Sylvian aqueduct. . , At a very early period—in some animals before the closure of the cramal part of the neural tube-two lateral diverticula, the optic vesicles, appear, one on either side of the fore-brain ; for a time they communicate ^vith the cavity of the fore-brain by relatively wide openings. The peripheral parts of the vesicles expand while the proximal parts are reduced to tubular stalks, the oftic stalks. The optic vesicle gives rise to the retina and the epithehum on the back of the cihary body and iris ; the optic stalk is invaded by nerve-fibres to form the optic nerve. The fore-brain then grows forwards, and from the alar laminae of this front portion the cerebral hemi- spheres originate as diverticula which rapidly expand to form two large pouches, one on either side. The ca%nties of these diverticula are the rudiments of the lateral ventricles ; they com- municate with the mesial part of the fore-brain caA^ty by re- latively wide openings, which ultimately form the foramen of Monro in the adult brain. The mesial portion of the wall of the fore-brain vesicle consists of a thin lamina, the lamina icr- minalis (figs. 155. 157), which stretches from the foramen of Monro to the recess at the base nntir stilk The anterior part of the fore-brain, including the rudiments o tie ce^ bra hemispheres i na^ed the telencephalon, and its posterior portion tl termed the diencelhalon; both of these contribute to the formation of the Th?£cip/^«ion.-From the alar lamina of tlie diencephalon the tlialamus metathalamus^ and epithalamus are developed.

NEUROLOGY 842 (3) The lillei or lemniscus (fig. 716).—The fibres of the fillet have been seen to take origm in the gracile and cuneate nuclei of the medulla oblongata, and to cross to the opposite side in the sensory decussation (page 816). They then pass upwards tlirough the medulla, in which they are situated behind the pyramidal fibres and between the olivary bodies. Here they are joined by the fibres of Gowers' ascending tract, these having already undergone decussation in the spmal cord. As the fillet ascends, it receives additional fibres from the terminal nuclei of the sensory nerves of the opposite side. In the pons, it assumes a flattened, ribbon-like appearance, and is placed on the dorsal aspect of the trapezium. In the mid-brain, its outer part is folded backwards and Fig. 716.—Scheme showing the course of the fibres of the fillet; mesial fillet in blue, lateral fillet in red.

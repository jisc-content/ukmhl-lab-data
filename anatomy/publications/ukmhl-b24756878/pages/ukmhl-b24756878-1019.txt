ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE ri"^HE organs of the senses (organa sensuum) are five in number : viz. tliose i of Touch, of Taste, of Smell, of Sight, and of Hearing. The skin, which is the principal seat of the sense of touch, has been described in the section on Histology. The remaining four are the organs of special sense. PapillcB ORGANS OF TASTE The peripheral organs of the sense of taste consist of certain flask-shaped groups of modified epithelial cells termed taste-buds, Avhich are found on the tongue and adjacent parts. They occupy nests in the Fig. 821.—Section of part of the papilla foliata stratified epithelium, and of a rabbit. (Magnified.) are present in large numbers on the sides of the circum- vallate papillte (fig. 821), and to a less extent on their opposed walls. They are also found on the fungiform papillse over the back part and sides of the tongue, and in the general epithelial covering of the same areas. They are very plentiful over the fimbriae linguae, and are also present on the under aspect of the soft palate, and on the posterior surface of the epiglottis.

The bud is formed by two kinds of cells : supporting cells and gustatory cells. The supporting cells are mostly arranged like the staves of a cask, and form an outer envelope for the bud. Some, however, are found in the interior of the bud between the gustatory cells. The gustatory cells occupy the central portion of the bud ; they are spindle-shaped, and each possesses a large spherical nucleus near the middle of the cell. The peripheral end of the cell termi- nates at the gustatory pore in a fine hair-like filament, the gustatory hair. The central process passes towards the deep extremity of the bud, and there ends

ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 1058 tlie canalis reuniens of Hensen (fig. 867), a very delicate canal, by which the ductus cochlearis is brought into continuity with the saccule. The auditory nerve, the special nerve of the sense of hearing, divides, at the bottom of the internal auditory meatus, into two branches, the cochlear and vestibular. The vestibular nerve, the posterior of the two, presents, as it lies in the internal auditory meatus, a ganglion, the ganglion of Scarpa, the cells of which constitute the real origin of the nerve ; it divides into three branches, which pass through minute openings at the upper and back part of the bottom of the meatus {area vestibularis superior), and, entermg the vestibule, are distributed to the utricle and to the ampullae of the external and superior semicircular canals. The nervous filaments enter the Pig. 875.—Part of the cochlear division of the auditory nerve, highly magnified. (Henle.) Ganglion Spiral spirale fibres Nerve-fibres passing out between the two layers of tlie lamina spiralis ossca ampullary enlargements opposite the septum transversum, and arborise around tlie hair-ceUs. In the utricle and saccule the nerve-fibres pierce the membrana propria of the maculae, and end in arborisations round the hair-ceUs. Tlie cochlear nerve gives off the branch to the saccule, the filaments of which are transmitted from the internal auditory meatus through the foramina of the area vestibularis inferior, which lies at the lower and back part of the floor of the meatus. It also gives off the branch for the ampulla of the posterior semicircular canal, wliich leaves the meatus through the foramen singulare. . ^ i „„„ The rest of the cochlear nerve divides into numerous filaments at the base of the modiolus ; those for the basal and middle coils pass through the foramma in the tractus foraminosus, those for the apical coil through the canalis cen- tralis and the nerves bend outwards to pass between the lameUse of the osseous spiral lamina. Occupying the spiral canal of the modiolus is the ganglion spirale cochlem (fig. 875), consisting of bipolar nerve-ceUs, w uch reaUy con- stitute the true cells of origin of this nerve, one pole bemg Prolonged central y to the brain and the other peripheraUy to the hair-cells of Corti s organ Reaching the outer edge of the osseous spiral lamma, they V^^_^ ^^'^oj^fl^lll foramina in the labium tympanicum; some end by arbonsmg ^^^"1^ ti e base, of the inner hair-cells, while others pass between Corti's rods and thiough the tunnel, to terminate in a similar manner in relation to the outer hair-cells.

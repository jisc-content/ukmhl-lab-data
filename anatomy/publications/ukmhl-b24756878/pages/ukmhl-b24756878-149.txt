DEVELOPMENT OF THE EYE 131 aud grow into the optic stalk from the nerve-cells of the retina, but a few extend in the opposite direction and are derived from nerve-cells in the brain. The crystalline lens is developed from the lens vesicle, which recedes within the margin of the cup, and becomes separated from the overlying ectoderm by mesoderm. The cells forming the posterior wall of the vesicle lengthen and are converted into the lens-fibres, which grow forward and fill up the cavity of the vesicle. The cells Fig. 167.—Sagittal section of eye of human embryo of six weeks.

By the second month the lens is invested by a vascular mesodermal capsule, the tunica vasculosa lentis, the blood-vessels of which are chiefly derived faom the central artery of the retina ; the part of Fig. 168.—Section through the head of a hviman embryo, about twelve days old, in the region of the hind-brain.

By the sixth month all the vessels of the capsule are atrophied except one, the wrteria hyaloidea, which disappears during the ninth month ; the position of' this artery is indicated in the adult by the canalis hyaloideus, which reaches from the K 2

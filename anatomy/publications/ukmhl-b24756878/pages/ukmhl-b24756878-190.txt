About the seventh week the distinction of sex in the genital ridge begins to be perceptible. The ovary, thus formed from the genital ridge, consists of a central part of connective tissue covered by a layer of epithehum, the germinal efithelium. Between the cells of the germinal epithelium a number of larger cells, the frimitive ova, are found, and these are carried into the subjacent stroma by bud-hke ingrowths of the germinal epithehum, the cells of which surround the primitive ova ; in this manner the primitive Graafian folhcles are formed. The rest of the germinal epithelium on the surface of the ovary forms the per- manent epithehal covering of this organ (fig. 237). According to Beard the primitive ova are early set apart during the segmentation of the ovum and migrate into the germinal ridge.

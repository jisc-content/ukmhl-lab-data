The acromio-thoracic (a. thoracoacromialis) is a short trunk, which arises from the fore part of the axillary artery, its origin being generally overlapped by the upper edge of the Pectoralis minor. Projecting forwards to the upper border of this muscle, it pierces the costo-coracoid membrane and divides into four branches—pectoral, acromial, clavicular, and humeral. The -pectoral branch (ramus pectoralis) runs forwards and inwards between the two Pectoral muscles, and is distributed to them and to the mammary gland, anastomosing with the inter- costal branches of the internal mammary. The acromial branch (ramus acromialis) is directed outwards towards the acromion, supplying the Deltoid muscle, and anastomosing, on the surface of the acromion, with tlae suprascapular and posterior circumflex arteries. The clavicular branch (ramus clavicularis) runs upwards and inwards to the sterno-clavicular joint, supplying this articulation, and the 8ub- clavius muscle. The humeral branch (ramus deltoideus) passes, in the same groove as the cephalic vein, between the Pectoralis major and Deltoid, and gives branches to })oth muscles. 3. The long thoracic (a. thoracalis lateralis) passes downwards and inwards along the lower border of the Pectoralis minor to the side of the chest, supplying the Serratus maguus, the ffiG. 595—The scapular and circumflex arteries.

The alar thoracic is a small branch, which sup- plies the glands and areolar tissue of the axilla. Its place is frequently taken by branches from some of the other thoracic arteries. 5. The subscapular (a. subscapularis), the largest branch of the axillary artery, arises opposite the lower border of the Subscapularis, and passes downwards and backwards along this border to the inferior angle of the scapula, where it anastomoses with the long thoracic and intercostal arteries and with the posterior scapular branch of the transversalis colli, and terminates by supplying branches to the muscles m the neighbourhood.

NEUROLOGY 960 at the bend of the elbow, where it is situated beneath the bicipital fascia, and is separated from the elbow-joint by the Brachialis anticus. In the forearm it passes between the two heads of the Pronator teres and crosses the ulnar artery, but is separated from this vessel by the deep head of the Pronator teres. It descends beneath the Plexor sublimis digitorum, lying on the ilexor profimdus digitorum, to within two inches above the anterior annular ligament of the wrist r here it becomes more superficial, and is situated between the tendons of the Plexor sublimis digitorum and Plexor carpi radialis.

Branches. — With the exception of the nerve to the Pronator teres, which sometimes arises above the elbow-joint, the median nerve gives off no branches in the arm. As it passes in front of the elbow, it supplies one or two articular twigs to the jomt. In the forearm its branches are, muscular, anterior mter- osseous, and palmar cutaneous. The muscular branches are derived from the nerve near the elbow and supply aU the superficial muscles on the front of the forearm, except the Plexor carpi ulnaris. The anterior interosseous (n. interosseus antibrachii volaris) supplies the deep muscles on the front of the forearm, except the inner half of the Plexor profundus digitorum. It accompanies the anterior interosseous artery along the inter- osseous membrane, m the interval between the Plexor longus poUicis and Flexor profundus digitorum. supplying the wliole ot the former and the outer half of the latter, and terminates below in the Pronator quadratus and ^^ "^^-Jo^f;^,,^,^^ ontaneus palmaris) arises from the The palmar cutaneous brmwh fascia above median ierve at the lower part of the foreain.^ ^^^^ divides into two Uie annular ligament, descendnig ovex^ that h^ cl^^^ branches; the outer suppies t^^^^J^'^^^^r^^^^^ communicates with the anterior cutaneous branch oi

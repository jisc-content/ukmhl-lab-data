The portion contamed within the pericardium is covered, in front and laterally, by the serous layer of that membrane. The superior vena cava has no valves. The azygos veins (fig. 639) are three in number ; they collect the blood from the majority of the intercostal spaces, and connect the superior and inferipr von;e cava5. . „ The vena azygos major (v. azygos) commences opposite the first or second lumbar vertebra, by a branch, the ascending lumbar vein (v lumbahs ascendens) connecting the right lumbar veins; sometimes by a branch froni the riaht renal vein, or from the inferior vena cava. It enters the thorax thi-ough the aortic opening in the Diaphragm, and passes along the right side of the vertebral column to the fourth thoracic vertebra, where it arches forward over the root of the right lung, and terminates in the superior vena cava just before that vessel enter! the pericardium.

168 EMBRYOLOGY in association with which the Wolffian duct remains as the duct of the male genital gland, the Miillerian as that of the female. The Pronephros and Wolffian duct.—In the outer part of the intermediate cell-mass, immediately under the ectoderm, a longitudinal cord of cells makes its appearance. This cellular cord sinks into the subjacent mesoderm, and, acquiring a lumen, constitutes the Wolffimi duct* which passes backwards and opens into the ventral part of the cloaca. . , , i • i r .1 In front of the duct there are developed a number of tubules which form the pronephros or head-Udney^&w early embryonic structure in all vertebrates This consists of a series of transverse tubides which open into a duct termed the p»-o- nephric duct ; this duct is continuous posteriorly mth the Wolffian duct. Each pronephric tubule commmiicates by means of a funnel-shaped cihated opemng with the coelomic cavity, and in the course of each duct a glomerulus also is developed. The pronephros undergoes rapid atrophy and practicaUy disappears In the female the remains of it are probably represented by the hydatids ot Morgagni at the fimbriated end of the Fallopian tube ; in the male, by the stalked hydatid at the upper end of the testicle.

Each tubule opens externally into the duct, while its opposite end is mvagmated by a tu^tt ot capillary blood-vessels to form a glomerulus. These tubules increase »i "^^J^er, and collectively constitute the mesonephros or Wol^an body (fig^; f I'/^^^j- At the beginning of the second month this body forms aii '^^''S^^.'f'^^^^ shaped structure: which projects into the coelomic cavity at the side «f d^^^^^^^ mesentery, and reaches from the septum transversum in front to tl^ejii^f. somite behind.

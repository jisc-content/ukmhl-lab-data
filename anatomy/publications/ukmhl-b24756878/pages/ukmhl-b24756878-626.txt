ANCIOLOGY The Left Auricle (atrium sinistruni) is ratlicr Hiualler than the liL'lit, but its walls are thicker, measuring about 3 mm. ; it consists, like the riglit, of two parts, a principal cavity and an appendix auriculae. The principal cavity is cuboidal in form, and concealed, in front, by the pulmonarj' artery and aorta ; in front and to the right, it is separated from the right auricle by the septum auricularuni ; behind, it receives on either side the two pulmonary veins. The appendix auriculae is somewhat coastricted at its junction with the principal cavity ; it is longer, narrower, and more curved than that of the right side, and its margins are more deeply indented. It is directed for\vardh< and towards the right and overlaps the root of the pulmonarj"^ artery. The interior of the left auricle (fig. 567) presents the following parts for examination : The openings of the four pulmonary veins. Left auriculo-ventiicular opening. Musculi peetinati. The pulmonary veins, four in number, open into the upper part of the l)osterior surface of the left auricle—two on either side of its middle hue : Fig. 567.—The left auricle and ventricle laid open, the posterior walls of both having been removed. they are not provided with valves. The two left veins frequently terminate by a common opening. xi i • i The left auriculo-ventricular opening is the aperture betw een the lett auncie and ventricae, and is rather smaller than the corresponding opening on the The musculi peetinati, fewer and smaller than in the right auricle, are confined to the inner surface of the appendix. . , On the septum auricularum may be seen a lunated impression, hounded below by a crescentic ridge, the concavity of which is turned upwards, iiie degression is just above the fossa ovalis of the right auricle. • , The Left Ventricle (ventriculus sinister) is longer and more cornea in shape than the right, and on transverse section its cavity pre.sents an oval or

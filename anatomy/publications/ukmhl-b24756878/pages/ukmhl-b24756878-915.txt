897 THE ARACHNOID MEMBRANE in which tlie anterior cerebral arteries are contained. Again, another space is formed in front of either temporal lobe by the arachnoid bridging across the fissure of Sylvius without dipping down to the bottom of the fissure. This space is a prolongation from the cisterna basalis, and contains the middle cerebral artery. Tlie subarachnoid space communicates with the general ventricular cavity of the brain by three openings : one of tliese, the foramen of Majendie is m the middle line at the inferior boundary of the "fourtli ventricle ; the otlier two are at the extremities of tlie lateral recesses of the fourth ventricle behind the upper roots of the glosso-pharyngeal nerves ; they are named the Joramina of Key and Retzius or of Laischka. It is stated by Meckel that the lateral ventricles also communicate with the subarachnoid space at the apices of tlieu- descending horns. There is no direct communication betAveen the subdural and subarachnoid spaces. The spinal part of the subarachnoid space is a very M'ide interval between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater, and is largest at the lower part of the spinal canal, where the arachnoid membrane encloses the nerves which form the Cauda equina. Superiorly, it is continuous with the cranial subarachnoid Fig. 759.—Diagrammatic representation of a section across the top of the skull shomng the membranes of the brain, &c.

ANGIOLOGY 730 The facial vein (v. facialis anterior) commences at the side of the root of the nose, being a direct continuation of the angular vein. It hes behind the facial artery and follows a less tortuous course. It runs obliquely downwards and outwards, beneath the Zygomaticus major and minor muscles, descends along the anterior border of the Masseter, crosses over the body of the lower jaw, with the facial artery, and passes obhquely outwards and backwards, beneath the Platysma and cer^'ical fascia superficial to the submaxillary gland. It unites with the anterior division of the tempore-maxillary vein to form a large trunk, the common facial vein (v. facialis communis), which enters the internal jugular vein.

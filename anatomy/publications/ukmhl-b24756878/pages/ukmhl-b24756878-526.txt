508 MYOLOGY In the aponeurosis of the External oblique, immediately above the crest of the pubis, is a triangular opening, tlie external abdominal ring, formed by a separation of the fibres of the aponeurosis in this situation. The following parts of the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle require further description, viz. the external abdominal ring, the inter- coluiunar fibres and fascia, Poupart's ligament, Gimbernat's ligament, and the triangular fascia. The external or superficial abdominal ring (annulus inguinalis subcuta- neus) is an interval in the aponeurosis of the External oblique, just above and to the outer side of the crest of the pubis. The aperture Ls oblique in direction, somewhat triangular in form, and corresponds with the course of the fibres of the aponeurosis. It usually measures from base to apex about an inch, and Pig. 503.—The external abdominal ring. transversely about half an inch. It is bounded below by the crest of the pubis; on either side by the margins of the opening m the aponeurosis, which are called the columns or pillars of the ring ; and above, by a series ot curved fibres, the intercolumnar (fig. 503), which pass across the upper angle of the ring, so as to increase its strength. • >■ j The external or inferior pillar (crus inferius) is the stronger ; it is formed by that portion of Poupart's ligament which is inserted into the spme of the pubis : it is curved so as to form a kind of groove, upon which the spermatic cord rests. The internal or superior pillar (crus superius) is a broad, thin, Hat band, which is attached to tlie front of the symphysis pubis, interlacing with its fellow of the opposite side, that of the right side bemg superficial. The external abdominal ring gives passage to tlie spermatic cord and ilio-inguinal nerve in the male, and to the round ligament of the uterus ana

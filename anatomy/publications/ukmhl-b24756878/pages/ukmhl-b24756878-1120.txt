1102 SPLANCHNOLOGY the osteoblasts to the formation of bone. Tliey are formed from the cells of the periphery of the papilla—that is to say, from the cells in immediate contact with the adamantoblasts of the special dental germ. These cells become elongated ; one end of the elongated cell restme against the epithelium of the special dental germs, the other being tapered and often branched By the du-ect transformation of the peripheral ends of these cells, or by a secretion from them, a layer of uncalcified matrix is formed which caps the cusp or cusps, if there are more than one, of the papUl^. In this matrix islets of calcification make thek appearance, and coalescing give rise to a continuous layer of calcified material which covers each cusp and constitutes the fii-st layer of dentine. The odontoblasts, having thus formed the first layer, retu'e towards the centre of the papilla, and as they do so produce successive layers of dentine from their peripheral extremities—that is to say, they form the dentinal matrix in which calcification subsequently takes place. As they thus recede from the periphery of the papilla, they leave behind them filamentous Processes of ceU protoplasm,^provided with finer side processes; these are suiTOunded by calcified mater and thus form the dentinal tubules, and, by thek side branches, the anastomosmg tabules whereby the dentinal tubules communicate: the processes of protoplasm conSed within them, constitute the dentinal fibres (Tomes's fibres) which as mentioned above are found within the tubules. In this way the entke thickness of the dentme ^ developed, each tubule being completed throughout its whole length by a smgle odonto- blast The central part of the papilla does not undergo calcification, but persists the nulD of the tooth. In this process of formation of dentine it has been shown that an un- ified matrL is first devLped, and that in this matrix ^ ?L'llnn™Ee which subseauentlv blend together to form a cap to each cusp : in like manner successive Tavers ^re produe^^^ which\ltimately become blended with each other.

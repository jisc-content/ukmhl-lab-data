12 HISTOLOGY • Lymph varies greatly iu composition in different parts of the body. Tlie lymph Icavin" the liver contains the greatest percentage of proteins and has the highest specific gravity. In the limbs the lymph is scanty and has a low specific gravity. The intestinal lymph (chyle) is intermediate in composition and contains in addi- tion the fat absorbed by the lacteals, which gives it a milky appearance. Fig. 8.—Simple pavement epitheUum. EPITHELIUM All the surfaces of the body—the external surface of the skin, the internal surfaces of the digestive, respiratory, and genito-urinary tracts the closed serous cavities, the inner coats of the vessels, the acini and ducts of all seci-eting and ex- creting glands, the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spina cord —are covered by one or more layers of simple cells, caUed ejnlhelium or epithelial cells. These cells are also present in the terminal parts of the organs of special sense, and in some other structures, such as the pituitary and th}T:oid bodies. They serve various purposes, forming in some cases a protective layer, in others acting as agents in secretion and excretion, and again in others being concerned in the elaboration of the organs of special sense. Thus, in the skin, the main purpose served by the epi- thehum (here called the e-pidermis) is that of protection. As the surface is worn away by the agency of friction new cells are supplied, and thus the true skin and the vessels and nerves which it contains are defended from damage. In the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane and its glands, the epithelial cells appear to be the principal agents in Pi-eP^^'^^g ^'^'^ digestive secretions and in selecting and modifjang materials for absoiption In other situations (as the nose, fauces, and respiratory passages) an importai^^^ office of the epitheUal cells appears to be to maintain an equable t^P^rj^J^ ^ the moisture with which they keep the smiace always ^.^^f the serous cavities they also keep the opposed layers mo st, and thus facilitate their movements on each other.

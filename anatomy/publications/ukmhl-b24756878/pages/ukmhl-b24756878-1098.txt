1080 SPLANCHNOLOGY Applied Anatomy.—Primary tumours of the mediastinum are usually lymphoma or lymphosarcoma arising from the thymus or from the bronchial or posterior mediastinal lymph-glands: sarcomata, dermoid cysts, and embryomata, occur more rarely. These tumours give rise to pain, deformity of the chest, and symptoms of pressure on the various nerves, blood-vessels, air-passages, lymphatics, and on the oesophagus, as these various structui-es pass through the thorax. They may produce physical signs very much like those of an aortic aneurysm, so that diagnosis between the two is often difficult.

A more chronic form associated with adhesions and inflammntioii of the pericardium—the so-called chronic adhesive mediastino-pericarditis—gives rise ro obscure symptoms suggesting gradual heart-failure, and leads to death slowly but surely.

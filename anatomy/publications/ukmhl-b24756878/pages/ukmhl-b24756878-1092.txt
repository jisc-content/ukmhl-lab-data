1074 SPLANCHNOLOGY is made from the upper border of the body of the hyoid bone to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, and is carried through the subcutaneous tissues and deep fascia between the margins of the Sterno-hyoid muscles. An incision is then made iu the crico-thyroid membrane, and one blade of a stout, sharp-pointed pair of scissors is introduced beneatli the lower border of the thyroid cartilage, and this structure is divided from below upw^ards. Great care must be taken to cut exactly iu the middle line to avoid wounding the vocal cords. If the two halves of the cartilage are now drawn apart, a very good view of the interior of the larynx will be obtained. Laryngotomy is anatomically a simple operation : it can readily be performed, and should be employed iir those cases where the air-passages require opening in an einer- woncy for the relief of some sudden obstruction to respiration. The crico-thyroid membrane is very superficial, bemg covered only in the middle Ime by the skin, super- ficial fascia, and the deep fascia. On either side of the middle Ime it is also covered by the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, which diverge from each other at their upper parts, leaving a shght interval between them. On these muscles rest the anterior jugular vems. The only vessel of any importance in connection with this operation is the crico-thyi-oid artery, which crosses the crico-thyroid membrane, and may be wounded, but rarely gives rise to any trouble. Tlie operation is performed thus : the head being thrown back and steadied by an assistant, the finger is passed over the front of the neck and the crico-thyroid depression felt for. A vertical mcision is then made through the skin m the middle line over this spot, and carried down through the fascia until the crico-thyroid membrane is exposed. A cross-cut is then made through the membrane, close to the upper border of the cricoid cartilage, so as to avoid, if possible, the crico- thyi-oid artery, and a laryngotomy tube inserted. It has been recommended, as a more rapid way of performing the operation, to make a transverse mstead of a longitudmal cut through the superficial structures, and thus to open at once the air-passages. It will be seen, however, that in operating in this way the anterior jugular veins are in danger of ^^^Tracheo^y may be performed either above or below the isthmus of the thyroid body, or this structure may be divided and the trachea opened behind it. From the relations already described it must be evident that the trachea can be more readily opened above than below the isthmus of the thyroid body. Tracheotomy above the isthmus is performed thus : the patient should, if possible be laid on his back on a table in a good light. A pUlow is to be placed under the ^^oMers and the head thrown back and steadied by an assistant. The sui-geon standmg on the right side of his patient makes an incision from an inch and a half to two mches in length in the median Ime of the neck from the top of the cricoid cartilage The mcision must be made exactly in the middle line so as to avoid the anterior jugular vems, and after the Tperficial structures have been divided, the interval between ^1^2, S^r^O'^^^^l^^^^.t must be found, the raphe divided, and the muscles drawn apart. The lower border of the Sid cartilage must^now be felt for, and the upper part o^^/ noint downwMds in the middle line. Bose has recommended that the layer of fascia in Ct ofThe trachea should be divided transversely at the level of the bo^df , ^^^^^ cricoid cartUaee, and, having been seized with a pair of forceps, pressed downw ards with tfe hldle S^^^^ By this means the isthmus of the thyroid gland is depress^ and is saved from all danger of being wounded, and the trachea cleanly exposed.

NEUROLOGY 938 The bulbar or accessory part is the smaller of the two. Its fibres arise from the cells of the nucleus amUquus and emerge as four or five delicate filaments from the side of the medulla, below the roots of the vagus It passes outwards to the jugular foramen, where it mterchanges fibres sviWx the spmal portion or becomes united to it for a short distance ; it is also connected m the foramen, with the ganglion of the root of the vagus by one or two filaments, it then passes through the foramen, and becoming again separated from the spinal portion it is contmued over the surface of the ganghon of the trunk of the vagus, being adherent to its surface, and is distributed principaUy to the pharyngea and superior laryngeal branches of the pneumogastric. Through the pharyngeal branch it probably supphes the Azygos uvulae and Levator palati muscles (see page 486). Some few filaments from it are continued into the trunk of the vagus Yia. 181.—Plan of the hypoglossal nerve. TO DURA-MATER ' TO GANG.ON TRUNK OF VAGUS .

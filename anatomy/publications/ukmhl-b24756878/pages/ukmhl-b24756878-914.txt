NEUROLOGY 896 Structure —The araclinoid consists of bundles of white fibrous and elastic tissue intimately blended together. Its outer surface is covered with a layer of eXtl eliunr Vessels of considerable size, but few in number, and, according o Boc°S:iek a rich plexus of nerves derived from the -o^or dnnsion ^^^^^^ hftli, the facial knd the spinal accessory nerves, are found in the aiachnoid. The subarachnoid space is the interval betM^een the arachnoid and p.a mate It is not properly speakmg, a space, for it is occupied everywhere by a siooiSv tissue cons^isting of trabecula3 of dehcate connective tissue, and inter- £ji^nn?rnrclianne^^ in which the subarachnoid fluid is contamed.

1063 THE LARYNX completely converted into bone. Lieaments.-The ligaments of the larynx (figs. 877,. 878) are extrinsic i.e. Reconnecting the thyroid cartilage and ej^iglottis wrth the hyoid bone and the cricoid cartilage with the trachea ; and intrinsic, those which connect the several cartilages of the larynx to each other. . EMc ligaJents.-The ligaments connecting the thyroid cartdage ^^^^^ the hyoid bone are three in number-the thyro-hyoid membrane, and the two lateral thyro-hyoid ligaments. -i \ • „ i^.^ori fiKrn The thyro-hyoid membrane (membrana hyothyreoidea) is a broad tibio- elastic, membranous layer, attached below to the upper border of tbe thjnxnd cartilage, and above to' the upper margin of the Posterior surface o the l^ody and greater cornua of the hyoid bone, thus passing behmd the posterior surface Fig. 878.—Ligaments of the larynx. Posterior view. Hyoid hone Cartilago iriticea Thyro-hyoid membrane Cartilage of Santorini Arytenoid Posterior crico-arytenoid ligament Crico-thyroid articulation of the body of the hyoid, and being separated from it by a synovial bursa, which facilitates the upward movement of the larynx during deglutition. It is thicker in the middle hne than at either side, and is pierced, in the latter situation, by the superior larynaeal vessels and the internal laryngeal nerve. Its anterior surface is in relation wth the Thyro-hyoid, Sterno-hyoid, and Omo-hyoid muscles, and with the body of the hyoid bone. The lateral thyro-hyoid lujamenl (lig. hyothyreoideum laterale) is a round elastic cord, which passes between the superior cornu of the ala of the thyroid cartilage and the extremity of the greater cornu of the hyoid bone. A small cartilaginous nodule {cartilago triticea), sometimes bony, is frequently found in it.

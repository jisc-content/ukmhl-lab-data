693 INFERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY Inferior Mesenteric Artery (fig. 607) The inferior mesenteric artery (a. mesenterica inferior) supplies the descending, ihac, and pelvic portions of the colon, and the greater part of the rectum. It is smaller than the superior mesenteric, and arises from the front and towards the left side of the aorta, between one and two inches above the division into the common iliacs. It passes downwards to the left iliac fossa, and then descends, between the layers of the pelvic mesocolon, into the pelvis, under the name of the superior hannorrhoidal artertj. It lies at first in Fig. 607.â€”^The inferior mesenteric artery and its branches. close relation with the left side of the aorta, and then passes as the superior hsemorrlioidal in front of the left common iliac artery. Its branches are: Left coUc. Sigmoid. Superior hjemorrhoidal. The left colic (a. colica sinistra) passes behind the peritoneum, in front of the left kidney, to reach the descending colon ; it divides into an ascending branch which runs between the two layers of the transverse mesocolon and anastomoses with the middle coUc, and a descending branch which anastomoses with the upper sigmoid artery. ' From the arches formed by these anastomoses branches are distributed to the descending colon. The sigmoid arteries (aa. sigmoideoe) run obhquely downwards and outwards behind the peritoneum and in front of the Psoas and ureter to the iliac colon. They divide into branches which supply the lower part of the descending colon, the

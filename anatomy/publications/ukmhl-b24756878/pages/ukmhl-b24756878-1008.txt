990 NEUROLOGY Cervico-cephalic Portion of the Gangliatbd Cord (fig. 817) The cervico-cephalic portion of each gangliated cord (pars cephaUca et cervicalis s. sympathici) consists of three ganglia distinguished, according to Iheir position as the superior, middle, and inferior cervical, connected by intervening coids. This portion of the sympathetic cord receives no white S n communicantes from the cervical spinal nerves, its spinal fbres being derived from the white rami of the upper thoracic nerves, w nch enter the cmTCsponding thoracic gangUa of the sympathetic, and through these ascend ''''The' superior cervical ganglion (ganglion cervicale superius) tlie largest of the three is placed opposite the second and thu'd cervical vertebr*.

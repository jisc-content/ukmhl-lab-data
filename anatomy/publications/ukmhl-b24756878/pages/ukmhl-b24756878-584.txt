566 MYOLOGY Abscess •within the sheath of the Psoas muscle {psoas abscess) is generally due to tuberculous caries of the bodies of the lower thoracic or the lumbar vertebrsB. When the disease is in the tlioracio region, the matter tracks down the posterior mediastinum, in front of the bodies of the vertebnc, and, passing beneath the ligamentum arcuatum internum, enters the sheath of the Psoas muscle, down which it travels as far as the pelvic brim; it then gets beneath the iliac portion of the fascia, and fills up the iliac fossa. In con- sequence of the attachment of the fascia to the pelvic brim, it rarely finds its way into the pelvis, but passes by a narrow opening under Poupart's ligament into the thigh, to the outer side of the femoral vessels. It thus follows that a psoas abscess may be descriiied as consisting of four parts : (1) a somewhat narrow channel at its upper part, in the psoas sheath ; (2) a dilated sac in the iliac fossa ; (3) a constricted neck imder Poupart's ligament; and (4) a dilated sac in the upper part of the thigh. When the lumbar vertebrte are the seat of the disease, the matter finds its way directly into the substance of the Psoas. The muscular fibres are destroyed, and the nerves contamed in the abscess are isolated and exposed m its interior ; the iliac vessels which he m front of the fascia remain intact, and the peritoneum seldom becomes implicated. All psoas abscesses do not, however, pursue this course : the matter may leave the sheath of the muscle above the crest of the ilium, and tracking backwards may pouit in the loin (lumbar abscess) ; or it may point above Poupart's hgament in the inguinal region ; or it may follow the course of the ihac vessels mto the pelvis, and, passmg through the great sacro-sciatic notch, discharge itself on the back of the thigh.

The superficial fascia forms a continuous layer over the whole of the thi':^h • it consists of areolar tissue, containing in its meshes much fat and is capable of being separated into two or more layers, between which are found the superficial vessels and nerves. It varies in thickness m ditterent parts of the limb ; in the groin it is thick, and the two layers are separated from one another by the superficial inguinal lymphatic glands, the mternai saphenous vein, and several smaller vessels. One of these two layers, the superficial, is continuous above with the superficial fascia of the abdomen The deep layer of the superficial fascia is a very thm, fibrous layer, best marked on the inner side of the long saphenous vem and belo^^' Poupart s ligament. It is placed beneath the subcutaneous vessels and nerves and upoi^tlie surtace of the fascia lata. It is intimately adherent to the fascia lata a little below Poupart's ligament. It covers the saphenous opening in the fascia lata being closely united to its circumference, and is connected to the sheath ot the femoral vessels. The portion of fascia covering this aperture is perforated by the internal saphenous vem ahd by numerous blood and lymphatic vessels, hence it has been termed the cribriform fascia, the openings for these vesse s havmg been likened to the holes in a sieve. A large subcutaneous bursa is foundin the superficial fascia over the patella. ^ i. +i f„^^;n The deep fascia of the thigh is named, from its great extent, the jascia Zato ; it constitutes a uniform investment for the whole o tins regio;^ of he limb but varies in thickness in different parts.

157 DEVELOPMENT OF THE ALIMEN1\4RY CANAL alimentary canal forms a nearly straight tube in front of the notochord and m-iniitive aortaj (fig. 200). From the stomach to the rectum it is attached to the notochord by a band of mesoderm, from which the common mesentery of the gut is subsequently developed. The stomach has an additional attachment, viz. : to the Fig. 209.—Front view of two successive stages in the development of the alimentary canal. (His.)

The cephalic portion of the septum takes part in the formation of the Diaphragm (see page 167), while the caudal portion into which the liver grows forms the vcnlral mesogastrium (fig. 210). The stomach undergoes a further dilatation, and its two curvatures can be recognised (figs. 208, b, and 210), the greater directed towards the vertebral column and the lesser towards the anterior wall of the abdomen, while its two surfaces look to the right and left respectively. The mid-gut undergoes great elongation, and forms a V-shaped loop which projects downwards and forwards ; from the bend or angle of the loop the vitelhne duct passes to the umbihcus (fig. 211). For a time a part of the loop extends beyond

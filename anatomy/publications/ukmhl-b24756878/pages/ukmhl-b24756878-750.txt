As it passes across the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, it receives the mastoid vein, and thus establishes a communication with the lateral sinus. Veins of the Neck (fig. 627) The veins of the neck, which return the blood from the head and face. are : External jugular. Posterior external jugular. Vertebral. Anterior jugular. Internal jugular. The external jugular vein (v. jugularis externa) receives the greater part of the blood from the exterior of the cranium and deep parts of the face, being formed by the junction of the posterior division of the temporo-maxillary with the posterior auricular vein. It commences in the substance of the parotid gland, on a level ^vith the angle of the mandible, and runs perpendicularly Fig. 627.â€”^The veins of the neck, viewed from ia front. (Spalteholz.)

137 DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEART ostabUshed, and by means of it nutritive materials are absorbed from, and waste uroducts given up to, the maternal blood. , t n ^. r j ^ The uSibilical vei:as, Uke the viteUine, become mterrupted by the hver, and the blood returned bv them passes through this organ before reachmg the heart. Ultimately the right umbiUcal vein shrivels up and disappears, as will be explained later (pages 145, 146).

Further development of the heart.—The simple tubular heart, already described, becomes elongated and bent on itself so as to form an S-shaped loop, the anterior part bending to the right and the posterior part to the left. The intermediate portion arches transversely from right to left, and then turns sharply forward into the anterior part of the loop.

The constriction between the auricle and ventricle constitutes the auricular canal, and indicates the site of the future auriculo-ventricular valves.

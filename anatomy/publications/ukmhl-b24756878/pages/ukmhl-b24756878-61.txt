43 NERVOUS TISSUE To the naked eye a difEerence is obvious between certain portions of tlie brain uul spinal cord, viz. the grey matter and the while matter. The grey matter is Ym. 54.—^Various forms of nerve-cells. A. Pyramidal cell. U. Small multipolar cell, in which the axon quickly divides into numerous branches, c. Small fusiform cell. D and E. Qanglion cells (B shows T-shaped division of axon), ax. Axon, c Capsule. largely composed of nerve-cells, while the white matter contains only their long processes, the nerve-fibres. It is in the former that nervous impressions and Fig. 55.—Bipolar nerve-cell from the spinal ganglion of the pike. (After Kolliker.)

Hence the grey matter forms the essential con- stituent of all the ganglionic centres, both those in the isolated ganglia and those aggregated in the brain and spinal cord ; while the white matter is foimd in the commissural portions of the nerve-centres and in the peripheral nerves.

Some of the cells are stellate in shape, and their fine processes become neurogUa-fibres, which extend radially and

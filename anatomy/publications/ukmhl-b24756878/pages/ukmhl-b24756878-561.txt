MUSCLES AND FASCIiE OF THE FOREARM 543 Opposite the middle of the proximal and second phalanges the sheaths are very strong, and the fibres pass transversely ; but opposite the joints they are much thimier, and the fibres are directed obliquely. Each sheatli is lined by a synovial membrane, which is reflected on the contained tendons. Deep Layer (fig. 522) Flexor profundus digitorum. Flexor longus poUicis. Pronator quadratus. The Flexor profundus digitorum (m. flexor digitorum profundus) is situated on the ulnar side of the forearm, immediately beneath the superficial Flexors. It arises from the upper three-fourths of the anterior and inner surfaces of the shaft of the ulna, embracing the insertion of the Brachialis anticus above, and extending below, to within a short distance of the Pronator quadratus. It also arises from a depression on the inner side of the coronoid process ; by an aponeurosis from the upper three-fourths of the posterior border of the ulna, in common with the Flexor and Extensor carpi ulnaris; and from the ulnar half of Fig. 523.â€”Vincula aecessoria and tendons of forefinger. the interosseous membrane. The fibres form a fleshy beUy of considerable size, M'hich divides into four tendons : these run under the anniilar ligament beneath the tendons of the Flexor sublimis digitorum. Opposite the first phalanges, the tendons pass through the openings in the tendons of the Flexor sublimis digitorum, and are finally inserted into the bases of the last phalanges. Tlie portion of the muscle for the index finger is usually distinct throughout, but the tendons for the three inner fingers are connected together by cellular tissue and tendinous slips, as far as the palm of the hand.

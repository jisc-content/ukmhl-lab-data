1132 SPLANCHNOLOGY appendix is the ileo-cascal fossa. It is bounded above by the posterior surface of the ileum and the mesentery ; in front and below by tlie ileo-cajcal fold, and behind by the upper part of the mesentery of the appendix, (o) The subcmcal fossa (retro-ctecal) is situated immediately behind the cajcum, whicli has to be raised to bring it into vi^w. It varies much in size and extent. In some cases it is sufficiently large to admit the index finger, and extends upwards behind the ascending colon in the direction of the kidney : in others it is merely a shallow depression. It is bounded and formed by two folds : one, the parieto-coUc, which is attached by one edge to the abdominal wall Fig. 932.—The sub-csecal fossa. The ileum and csecum are draw-n backwards and upwards. (Souligoux.)

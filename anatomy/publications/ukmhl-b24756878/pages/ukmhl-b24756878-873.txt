855 THE CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES commissure to the under surface of the splenium is a second white band named the fornix : between this and the corpus callosum are the laminae of tlie septum pellucidum, enclosing between them the cavity of tlie so-called fifth ventricle. Surfaces of the Cbrebbal Hemispheres Each hemispliere presents three surfaces : an outer, a mesial, and a lower. The outer surface is convex in adaptation to the concavity of the corresponding half of tlie vault of the cranium. The mesial surface is flat and vertical, and is separated from that of the opposite hemisphere by the great longitudinal fissure and the falx cerebri. The lower surface is of an irregular form, and may be divided into three areas : anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior area, formed by the orbital surface of the frontal lobe, is concave, and rests on the roof of the orbit and nose ; the middle area is convex, and consists of the under surface of the temporal lobe : it is adapted to the corresponding half of the middle cranial fossa. The posterior area is concave, directed inwards as well as downwards, and is named the tentorial surface, since It rests upon the tentorium cerebelh, which intervenes between it and the upper surface of the cerebellum. These three surfaces are separated from each other by the folloM'ing borders : |a) supero-mesial, between the outer and mesial surfaces ; (b) infero-lateral, between the outer and inferior surfaces ; the anterior part of this border separating the outer from the orbital surface, is knoM^n as the superciliary border; {c) internal occipital, separating the mesial and tentorial surfaces; and W internal orbital, separating the orbital from the mesial surface.

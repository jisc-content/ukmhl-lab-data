ill6 SPLANCHNOLOGY Applied .4nf(to?H//.—Hypertroiihy of the lyinpliatic iLssue in llie naso-pliuiynx, com- monly known as ' adenoids,' is a frequent cause of moutli-breatliing and all its attendant disadvantages and dangers in children. It entails a pronencss to inflammation of all parts of the air-passages and of the Eustachian tui)es,and leads to deformed development of the palate and dental arch. In many cases adenoids tend to atrophy about the age of puberty, by which time their presence is likely to have caused permanent injury to the healtli and" development of the patient. No certain remedy for adenoids exists excepting operation. . . ... The pharynx is sometimes the seat of a pouch-like dilatation of its walls, in whicli the food collects when the patient swallows. A cure is effected by remo\dng the diverti- culum and accm'ately sutm-ing the opening in the pharynx which has been made. The internal carotid artery is in close relation with the pharynx, so that its pulsations can be felt through the mouth. It has been occasionally wounded by sharjj-pointed instruments, introduced into the mouth and thrust through the wall of the pharynx. In aneurysm of this vessel in the neck, the tumour necessarUy bulges into the pharynx, as this is the dii'ection in which it meets \vith the least resistance, nothing lying between the vessel and the mucous membrane except the thin Constrictor muscle, whereas on the outer side there are the dense cervical fascia, the muscles descending fi-om the styloid process, and the margin of the Sterno-mastoid. , . i^. t c The mucous membrane of the pharynx is very vascular, and is often the seat ot inflammation, freuuentlv of a septic character, since the numerous recesses are prone to lodge micro-organisms." And, in addition, owing to its exposed situation, the mucous membrane is liable to be mitated by agents introduced during in-spiration The inflam- mation may be attended with serious consequences : it may extend up the jLustacliian tube and involve the middle ear ; it may spread to the entrance of the larynx, causmg ojdema and seriously interfering ^yith respiration; or, invading the Ijmiphatics, it may spread to the loose areolar tissue surrounding the pharyngeal wall, and may extend tar and v^dde, sometimes into the posterior mediastinum along the oesophagus. Abscess may form in the connective tissue behind the pharynx, between it and the vertebra column, constituting what is known as reiro-pharynqeal abscess. This is most commonly due to caries of the cervical vertebra;; but may also be caused by suppm-ation of a Ijnnphatic aland which is situated in this position opposite the axis, and which receives lymphatics from the nasal fossa ; by a gumma ; or by acute pharyngitis In tl^e- -ses tje pus may be easily evacuated by incision with a guarded bistouiy, through mouth, but to asentic reasons, it is desirable that the abscess should be opened from the neck In some Sstances tWs i; perfectly easy: the abscess can be felt bulging at the side of the neck^ Lnd merely reqni-es an incision for its rehef ; but this is not always so and then an fncisi^n should be made along the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid and the deep fascia cUvided. A dii-ector is now to be inserted into the wound, the forefinger of the left Ed bSng introduced into the mouth and pressure made upon the -^.f^^'f- ^^i! as a giiide? and the director is to be pushed onwards until pus api^pars in tl^e g>-oove A pai^ S sinus forceps is now inserted along the dii-ector and the opemng mto the cavitj '^Itscess also occurs in children, underneath the mucous membrane between it and thethary^geal aponeurosis. The condition usually arises from a Pe-tonsillar ^"J—on^ which spreads backwards. In some cases an enormous swelling may /o™' ^^l^i^^ ]~ forwards the soft palate and gives rise to respu-atory obstruction. In such the abscess s^u^'e opened tC^^ the mouth with the child in the inverted position, so as to prevent the first 2ush of pus from entering the superior opemng of the larynx. Foreign bodies not infrequently become lodged in the pharynx, ^ijd most usuaib' a^ is about six inches. The (Esophagus The CESOohaeus or gullet, is a muscular canal, about nine or ten inches in llatlf eXS-'fronf the pharynx to the stomach.

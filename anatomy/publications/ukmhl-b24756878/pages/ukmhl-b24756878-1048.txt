1030 ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE The palpebral fibres of ihe Orbicularis muscle are thin, pale in colour, and possess an involimtary action. The tarsal plates (fig. 849) are two thin elongated plates of dense connective tissue, about an inch in length. They are placed one in each lid, and contribute to its form and support. The superior tarsal plate (tarsus superior), the larger, is of a semilunar form, about one-third of an inch in breadth at the centre, FiQ. 849.—^The tarsal plates and their ligaments.

The inferior tarsal plate (tarsus inferior), the smaller, is thinner, and of an elliptical form. The free or ciliary margins of these plates are thick, and present perfectly straight edges. The attached or orbital margins are connected to the ckcum- ference of the orbit by the superior and inferior palpebral ligaments.

The inner angles of the two plates end at the lacus lacrimalis, and are attached to the frontal process of the maxilla by the internal tarsal ligament or tendo oculi. The palpebral ligaments are membranous expansions situated one m each lid, and attached margmally to the edge of the orbit, where they are continuous with the periosteum. The superior ligament blends with the tendon ot tlie Levator palpebra3 and the superior tarsal plate, the inferior with the interior

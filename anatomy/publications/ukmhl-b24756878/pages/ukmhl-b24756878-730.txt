712 . ANGIOLOGY from it by some fibres of tlie Psoas, is tlie anterior crural nerve. The femoral vein is on tlie inner side of the upper part of the artery, but is behind the vessel in the lower part of Scarpa's triangle. In Hunter s canal the femoral artery is more deeply situated, being covered by the integument, the superficial and deep fascife, the Sartorius and the fibrous roof of the canal; it is crossed from without inwards by the long saphenous nerve. Behind the artery arc the Adductores longus et magnus ; in front and to its outer side is the Vastus internus. The femoral vein lies behind the upper part, and on the outer side of the lower part of the artery. That portion of the femoral artery which extends from Poupart's ligament to the origin of the profmida is sometimes named the common femoral. Peculiarities.—Several cases are recorded in which the femoral artery divided into two tnmks below the origin of the profunda, and became reunited near the opening in the Adductor magnus, so as to form a single popUteal artery. One oecuiTed in a patient who was operated upon for popliteal aneurysm. A few cases have been recorded in which the femoral artery was absent, its place being supphed by the sciatic artery which accompanied the areat sciatic nerve to the pophteal space. Tlie external iliac iu these cases was small, and "terminated in the profunda. The femoral vein is occasionally placed along the inner side of the artery, throughout the entire extent of Scarpa's triangle ; or it maybe spUt so that a large vein is placed on either side of the artery for a greater or lesser distance. Surface Marking.—The upper two-thirds of a line drawn from a point midway between the anterior superior spine of the iUum and the symphysis pubis to the adductor tubercle on the mner condyle of the femur, with the thigh abducted and rotated outwards, will indicate the course of the femoral artery. . Ap-pUed Anatomy.—Compression of the femoral artery, which Ls constantly requisite in amputations and other operations on the lower limb, and also for the cure of popliteal aneurysm, is most effectuallv made immediately below Poupart's Hgament. In this situation the artery is very superficial, and is merely separated from the ascendmg ramus of the pubis by the Psoas muscle ; so that the surgeon, by means of his thumb or a compressor, may efEectuaUy control the circulation through it. The vessel may also be controlled in the middle third of the thigh by placmg a pad over the artery, beneath the tourniquet, and directing the pressure from withui outwards, so as to press the vessel against the inner side of the shaft of the femur. ,• , i The superficial position of the femoral artery in Scarpa's triangle renders it particularly liable to be mjured m wounds, stabs, or gimshot injuries in the grom. On account of the close relationship between the artery and vem, the latter vessel is also hable to be wounOea m these injuries. In such cases, the arterv being compressed as it crosses the ramus ot the pubis, the skm wound should be enlarged and the wound in the vessel sought for, and a Ugature apphed above and below the bleeding point. The application of a Ugature to the femoral artery may be required m cases of wound or aneurysm of the pophteal or femoral, or arteries of the leg ; and the vessel may be exposed and tied m any part of its course. The great depth of this vessel '^t /ts lower part, its close connection with important structures, and the density of its sheath, render the operation in this situation one of greater difficult;^ than the apphcation of a ligature at its upper part, where it is more superficial. , , . , , j- t Ligature of the common femoral artery is not regarded with much favour, on ficcount of the near connection of large branches with it, viz. the deep epigastric and the dee chcumflex ihac arismg just above Poupart's ligament ; on account of the ^^^^^J^r o small branches which arise from it, in its short course, and on account of the uneeitau^^^^^^^ the origm of the profunda femoris, which, if it arise high up, would 1^°/°° ^^^^ ligature for the formation of a firm coagulum.

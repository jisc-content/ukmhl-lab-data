NEUROLOGY 908 it leaves the skuU through the foramen ovale, and, immediately below this foramen, joins the inferior maxillary nerve. Besides the motor root, the large superficial petrosal nerve lies underneath the ganglion. •, Branches of communication.—Th:\s ganglion receives, on its inner side, falar ments from the carotid plexus of the sympathetic. Branches of distribution.—\.t aives off minute branches to the tentorium oerebelli, and to the dura mater in tlie midcUe fossa of the cranium. From its convex border, which is directed for- wards and outwards, three large brandies proceed, viz. the ophthalmic, superior maxillary, and inferior maxillary. The ophthalmic and superior maxillary consist exclusively of fibres derived from the ganghon, and are solely nerves of common sensation. The third division, or inferior maxiUary, J^^f^^ outside the cranium by the motor root, and is, therefore, strictly speakmg, the only portion of the fifth nerve which can be said to resemble a spinal nerve ^ Assoc ated with the three divisions of the fifth nerve are four small gangha. The o^SSc ga^^lion is connected with the first division ; the sp^no-^aM^ne or iMeckeVs ganglion with the second; and the otic and '^^^^^^^'^^^ with the third. All the four receive sensory filaments from the fifth, and motor and sympathetic filaments from various sources; these filaments are called the roots of the ganglia. Ophthalmio Nekve (figs. 767, 768, 769) The Oohthalmic nerve (n. ophthalmicus), or first division of the fifth, is a sensorv ne?ve lT supplies sensory branches to the cornea, cihary muscle and LrTJtre lachrymal fland and conjunctiva ; to a part of tl^^ and o th nSIsll fossl ; a^d to the integument of the J^^^^ds ^^^^^^^^ nn^P It is the smallest of the three divisions of the fifth, and aiises irom Fie. 769.—Nerves of the orbit and ophthalmic ganglion.

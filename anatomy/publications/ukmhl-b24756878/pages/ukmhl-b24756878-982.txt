964 NEUROLOGY The posterior muscular branch, of large size, arises from the nerve in the groove between the Triceps and the humerus. It divides into branches, which supply the inner and outer heads of the Triceps and tlie Anconeus muscles. The branch for the latter muscle is a long, slender filament, which descends in the substance of tlie inner Fig. 802.â€”The suprascapular, circumflex, and musculo-spiral nerves. Suprascapular Circumflex head of the Triceps to the Anconeus. The external muscular branches supply the Brachio- radialis, Extensor carpi radi- alis longior, and (usually) the outer part of the Brachialis anticus. The cutaneous branches are three in number, one internal and two external. The internal cutaneous branch arises in the axillary space, with the inner muscular branch. It is of small size, and passes through the axilla to the inner side of the arm, supplying the integument on its posterior aspect nearly as far as the olecranon. In its course it crosses beneath the intercosto-humeral, with which it communicates. The two external cuta- neous branches perforate the outer head of the Triceps at its attachment to the humerus. The u'p'per and smaller one passfes to the front of the elbow, lying close to the cephalic vein, and supplies the inteeument of the lower half of the arm on its anterior aspect. The lower branch pierces the deep fascia below the insertion of the Deltoid, and passes down along the outer side of the arm and elbow, and then along the back part of the radial side of the forearm to the wrist, supply- ing the integument in its course, and joining, near its termination, with the pos- terior cutaneous branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The radial (ramus super- ficialisn.radialis) pn.sses along the front of the radial side of the forearm to the commence- ment of its lower third. It lies at first a little to the outer ciflp of the radial artery, concealed beneath the Brachio-radialis.

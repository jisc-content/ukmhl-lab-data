EMBRYOLOGY 166 the right side of the pancreas is directed backwards and the left forwards. The "ght surface becomes applied to the posterior abdominal wall, and the peritoneum ri which covered it undergoes absorption ; and thus, in the adult, the gland appears to lie behind the peritoneal cavity. i ■, i The spleen (fig. 211).—Although the spleen belongs to the group of ductless o-lands, its development may be conveniently referred to here. It appears m the second month as a localised thickening of the mesoderm in the dorsal meso- gastrium above the tail of the pancreas. It grows towards the left side of the dorsal mesogastrium, and thus comes into contact with the right surface of the stomach. With the change in position of this viscus the spleen is earned to the left and comes to Ue behind the cardiac part of the stomach and in contact with the left kidney. The part of the dorsal mesogastrium which intervened between the spleen and the greater curvature of the stomach forms the gastro-splemc omentum. ^ , , . , , , , The Eespiratory Organs.—Towards the end of the third week a deep longi- tudinal furrow (figs. 203 and 204) appears in the ventral wall of the fore-gut, commencing at the level of the fourth visceral arch and reaching backwards nearly as far as the stomach. It is bounded in front by an elevation termed the Fig. 229.—Diagram of transverse section through rabbit embryo. (After Keith.)

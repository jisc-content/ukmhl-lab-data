THE FOURTH VENTRICLE 835 with the central caiical of the medulla oblongata ; * above, it communioates by means of a passage termed the aqueduct of Sylvius, with the cavity of the third ventricle. It presents four angles, and possesses a roof or dorsal wall, a floor or ventral wall, and lateral boundaries. Ang-les.—The superior angle is on a level witli the upper border of the pons \ arolu, and is continuous with the lower end of the aqueduct of Sylvius The inferior angle is on a level with the lower end of tlie olivary body, and opens into the central canal of the medulla oblongata. Each lateral angle corresponds with the pomt of meetmg of the three cerebellar peduncles. A little below the lateral angles, on a level with the striae acusticse, tlie ventricular cavity is prolonged outw^irds in the form of two narrow passages, one on either side. These are named the lateral recesses, and are situated between the restiform bodies and the flocculi, reaching as far as the attachments of tlie glosso-pharvneeal and vagi nerves. o x- .7 & .-.■"l^'i^u^^ boundaries.—The lower part of each lateral boundary is con- stituted by the clava, the fasciculus cuneatus, and the restiform body • the upper part by the superior cerebellar peduncle.

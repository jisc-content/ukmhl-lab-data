LYMPHATICS OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS 783 mesenteric artery ; a second, in relation to the loops and primary branches of the vessel; and a third along the trunk of the artery. Applied Anatomy.—Enlargement of the mesenteric lymphatic glands is seen in most diseased conditions of the intestinal tract, and is well marked in enteric fever, tuberculous ulceration or malignant gro\\i;hs of the 'bowel. The enlarged glands can often be palpated through the wall of the abdomen. The ileo-colic glands (fig. 665), from ten to twenty in number, form a chain around the ileo-colic artery, but show a tendency to subdivision into two groups, one near the duodenum and another on the lower part of the trunk of the artery. Where the vessel divides into its terminal branches the chain is broken up into several groups, viz. : (a) ileal, in relation to the ileal branch of the artery ; (6) anterior ileo-colic, usually of three glands, in the ileo-colic fold, near the wall Fig. 664.—Lymphatics of colon. (Jamieson and Dobson.) of the cHecum ; (c) posterior ileo-colic, mostly placed in the angle between the ileum and the colon, but partly lying behind the caecum at its junction with the ascending colon ; (d) appendicular, usually a single gland, between the layers of the meso-appendix, near its free edge ; (e) right colic, along the inner side of the ascending colon. The meso-colic glands are nimierous, and lie between the layers of the transverse meso-colon, in close relation to the transverse colon ; they are best developed in the neighbourhood of the hepatic and splenic flexures. One or two small glands are occasionally seen along the trunk of the riglit colic artery, and others are found in relation to the trunk and branches of the middle colic artery. The superior mesenteric glands receive afferents from the jejunum, ileum, cfficum, vermiform appendix, and the ascending and transverse parts of the colon ; their efferents pass to the pre-aortic glands.

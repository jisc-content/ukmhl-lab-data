NEUROLOGY 952 Deep Branches of the Cervical Plexus. Internal Series The communicating branches consist of several filaments, which pass from the loop between the first and second cervical nerves to tlie pneuraogastric, hypoglossal, and sympathetic. The branch to the hypoglossal ultimately leaves that nerve as a series of branches, viz. the descendens hypoglossi. the nerve to the Thyro-hyoid and the nerve to the Genio-hyoid (see page 940). A communicating branch also passes from the fourth to the fifth cervical, while each of the first four cervical nerves receives a grey ramus coramunicans from the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic.

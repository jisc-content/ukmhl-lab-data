SPLANCHNOLOGY 1070 Vessels and Nerves.—The arleries of the larynx are the laryngeal branches derived from the superior and inferior thyroid. The veins accompany the arteries : those accompanying the superior laryngeal artery join the superior thyroid vein which opens into the mternal jugular vein ; while those accompanying the inferior laryngeal artery join the inferior thyroid vein which opens into the innominate vein. The lymphatics consist of two sets, superior and inferior. The former accompany the superior laryngeal artery and pierce the thyro-hyoid membrane, to terminate in the glands situated near the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. Of the latter, some pass through the crico-thyroid membrane and open into a gland lying in front of that membrane or m front of the upper part of the trachea, while others pass to the deep cervical glands and to the glands which accompany the inferior thyroid artery. The nerves are derived from the internal and external larjoigeal branches of the superior laryngeal nerve, from the inferior or recurrent larjTigeal, and from the sympathetic. The internal laryngeal nerve is almost entkely sensory, but some motor filaments are said to be carried by it to the Ai-ytenoideus muscle. It divides into a branch which is distributed to both surfaces of the epiglottis, a second to the aryteno-epiglottic fold, and a third, the largest, wliich supplies the mucous membrane over the back of the larjmx and communicates with the recurrent laryngeal. The external laryngeal nerve supplies the Crico-thyroideus muscle. The recurrent laryngeal passes upwards under the lower bordei- of the Inferior constrictor, and enters the larynx between the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. It suppUes all the muscles of the larynx except the Crico-thyi'oideus, and perhaps a part of the Aiytenoideus. The sensory branches of the laryngeal nerves form subepithelial plexuses, from which fibres pass to end between the cells covering the mucous membrane. Over the posterior surface of the epiglottis, in the aryteno-epiglottic folds, and less regularly m some other parts, taste-buds, similar to those in the tongue, are found. The Trachea and Bbonchi (fig. 886) The trachea or windpipe, is a cartilaginous and membranous tube, which extends from the lower part of the larynx, on a level vnth the sixth cervical vertebra to the upper border of the fifth thoracic vertebra, where it divides into the two bronclii, one for each lung. The trachea is nearly but not qmte cylmdrical, being flattened posteriorly ; it measures about four mches and a half (11 cm ) in length ; its diameter, from side to side, is from tluree-quarters of an inch to an inch (19 to 25 mm.), being always greater m the male than in the female. , . , , ■ Relations —The anterior surface of the trachea is convex, and covered, !?i the neck, from above downwards, by the isthmus of the thyroid gland, the inferior thyroid veins, the arteria thyreoidea ima (when that vessel exists), the Sterno-thyroid and Sterno-hyoid muscles, the cer^acal fascia, and, more superficiaUy, by the anastomosing branches between the anterior jugular veins ; in the thorax, it is covered from before backwards by the first piece of the sternum, the remains of the thymus gland, the left innominate vein he arch of the aorta, the innominate and left common carotid arteries and the deep cardiac plexus. Posteriorly it is m relation mth the "^.^^Pl^.^f^^;j^^,"'; J; in the neck, it is in relation with the common carotid arteries, the l^teial lobes of the thyroid gland, the inferior thyroid arteries, and the recurrent laryngeal ner.e.

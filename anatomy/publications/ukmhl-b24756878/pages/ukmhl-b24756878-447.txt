APPLIED ANATOMY OF HIP-JOINT 429 head of the bone travels up behind the acetabulum, in front of the muscle ; while in the dislocation into the sciatic notch the head passes behind the muscle, and is prevented from reaching the dorsum, in consequence of the tendon of the muscle arching over the neck of the bone, and it therefore remains in the neighbourhood of the sciatic notch. Bigolow distinguishes these two forms of dislocation by describing them as dislocations backwards, ' above and below ' the Obturator internus. The ilio-femoral ligament is rarely torn in dislocations of the hip, and this fact is taken advantage of by the surgeon in reducing these dislocations by manipulation. It is made to act as the fulcrum to a lever, of which the long arm is the shaft of the femur, and the short arm the neck of the bone. The hip-joint is rarely the seat of acute synovitis from injury, on account of its deep position and its thick covering of soft parts. Acute inflammation may, and does, frequently occur as the result of constitutional conditions, as rheumatism, pyasmia, &c. When, in these cases, effusion takes place, and the joint becomes distended wth fluid, the swellmg is not very easy to detect on account of the thicluiess of the capsule and the depth of the articulation. It is principally to be found on the front of the joint, just internal to the ilio-femoral ligament ; or behmd, at the lower and back part. In these two places the capsule is thinner than elsewhere. Disease of the hip-joint is much oftener of a chronic character, and is usually of tuberculous Fig. 467.—Hip-joint, femoral ligament. showing the ilio- (After Bigelow.) origin. It begins either in the bones or in the synovial membrane ; usually in the former, and probably, in most cases, in the growng, highly vascular tissue in the neighbourhood of the epiphysial cartilage. In this respect it differs very materially from tuberculous arthritis of the knee, where the disease usually commences in the synovial membrane. In chi;Qnic hip-disease the affected limb assumes an altered position, the cause of which it is important to understand. In the early stage of a typical case, the limbls fl r-Xf• d. all(11101edr and' rotated outwards. In tins ptisitii iii all the ligaments of the joint are relaxed: the front of the capsule by flexion ; the outer band of the iho-femoral ligament by abduction ; and the inner band of this Ugament and the back of the capsule by rotation outwards. It is, therefore, the position of greatest ease. The condition is not quite obvious at first, upon examining a patient. If the patient is laid in the supine position, the affected limb will be found to be extended and parallel vnth the other. But it will be seen that the pelvis is tilted downwards on the diseased side and the limb apparently longer than its fellow, and that the lumbar spine is arched forwards (lordosis). The condition IS thus explained: a hmb which is flexed and abducted is obviously useless for progression, and in order to overcome the cbfficulty the patient depresses the affected side of his pelvis, thus producing parallelism of his imS nf T ite transverse horizontal axis, so as IdSed an™Sted This Wt"'*'^"'' °^ ^'^/i--^ the limb becomes flexed"and events as rega^rthe adducti^n^^^^^^^^ ^^'^T^' '^"^^"l'^^- ^'^t'^^' ^» nerve which aho Wpw J^.l r f^/^ 4^ductor muscles arc supplied by the obturator reflex act on by the^StZn nf J^'T '^^'^ '^'^'^^'^ thrown into inflamed articulation peripheral terminations of this nerve in the of middle age or Xan^ed Se m^^^^ 1 frequently affected.

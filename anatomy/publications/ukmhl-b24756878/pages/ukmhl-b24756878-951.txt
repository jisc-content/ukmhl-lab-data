TENTH CRANIAL NERVE 933 Tenth Nerve (figs. 783, 785, 786) The Tenth or Pneumogastric nerve (n. vagus) has a more extensive distribution than any of the other cranial nerves, since it passes through the neck and thorax to the upper part of the abdomen. It is composed of both motor and sensory fibres. It supplies the organs of voice and respiration with motor and sensory fibres ; and the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, and heart ^vith motor fibres. , . , x £i The superficial origin of the pneumogastric nerve is by eight or ten hlaments from the groove between the olivary and restiform bodies, below the glosso- pharyngeal. The sensory fibres arise from the cells of the ganglion of the root and the ganglion of the trunk of the nerve, and, when traced into the medulla, Fig. 785.—Mid- and hind-brains and upper part of spinal cord exposed from behind.

Some of the sensory fibres of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve have been seen to terminate in the upper part of this nucleus. A few of the sensory fibres of the vagus descend in the fasciculus solitarius and terminate around its cells. The motor fibres arise from the ceUs of the nucleus ambiguus, already referred to in connection with the motor root of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The filaments become united, and form a flat cord, which passes outwards beneath the flocculus to the jugular foramen, through which it emerges from the cranium. In passing through this opening, the pneumogastric is

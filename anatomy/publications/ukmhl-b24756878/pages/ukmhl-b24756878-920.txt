NEUROLOGY 902 foetal life The afferent fibres end in arborisations around the cells in the external geniculate body, pulvinar, and upper quadrigeminal body, which constitute the loiver visual centres. From these nuclei otlier fibres are prolonged to the cortical visual centre, wliich, according to most observers, is situated m the cuneus and in the neighbourhood of the calcarme fissure. Some fibres are detached from the optic tract, and pass through the crus cerebri to the nucleus of the third nerve. These fibres are small, and may be recxarded as afferent branches for the Sphincter pupillai and Ciliary muscles. Other fibres pass to the cerebellum through its superior peduncles, while others, again, are lost in the pons. YiG. 764.—Scheme showing central connections of the optic nerve and optic tract.

346 OSTEOLOGY Loiver extremity Fig. 399.—Plan of ossification of the tibia. From three centres. TJ'pper extremitij Appears before or shortly after birth ~si Joins shaft lJ''about Wth year depression is smooth, covered with cartilage iii the recent state, and articu- lates with the fibula. The surface is bounded by two prominent borders, continuous above with the interosseous ridge ; they afford attachment to the anterior and posterior inferior tibio-fibular hgaments. The internal surface is prolonged downwards to form a strong pyramidal process, flattened from without inwards—the internal malleolus (malleolus medialis). The inner surface of this process is convex and subcutaneous ; its outer surface (facies articularis malleolaris) is smooth and slightly concave, and articulates with the astragalus ; its anterior border is rough, for the attachment of the anterior fibres of the internal lateral ligament of the ankle-joint; its posterior border presents a broad and deep groove (sulcus malleolaris), directed ob- liquely do^vnwards and inwards, and occasionally double ; this groove transmits the tendons of the Tibialis posticus and Flexor longus digitorum. The summit of the internal malleolus is marked by a rough depression behind, for the attachment of the internal lateral ligament of the ankle- joint. Structure.—The structure of the tibia is like that of the other long bones. The compact wall of the shaft is thickest at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the bone. Ossification.—The tibia is ossified from J^ree centres (fig. 399): one for the shaft, and one for each ex- tremity. Ossification begins in the centre of the shaft about the seventh week of foetal hfe, and gradually extends towards the extremities. The centre for the upper epi- physis appears before or shortly after birth ; it is flattened in form, and has a thin tongue-shaped process in front, which forms the tubercle; that tor the lower epiphysis appears in the second year. The lower epiphysis joirm the shaft at about the eighteenth, and the upper one ]oms about the twentieth year Two additional centres occasionally exist, one for the tongue-shaped process of the upper epiphysis, which forms the tubercle, and one for the inner Articulations.—The tibia articulates with three bones : the femur, fibula, and astragalus.

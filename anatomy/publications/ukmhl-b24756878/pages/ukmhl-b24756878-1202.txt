Tlie calyces and pelvis lie within the sinus; the blood-vessels of the kidney, after passing Fio. 979.—^Transverse section, showing the relations of the capsule of the kidney. (After Gerota.) of Erector spines Fig. 980.—Vertical section of kidney, through the hilus, are also contained in the sinus, lying between its lining membrane and the excretory apparatus. The kidney is composed of an internal medullary and an external cortical portion. The medullary portion (substantia medul- laris) consists of a series of red-coloured striated conical masses, termed the medullary pyramids or pyramids of Malpighi (pjTamides renales), the bases of which are directed towards the circumference of the kidney, while their apices converge towards the renal sinus, where they form prominent papillaj (papUlm renales) pro- jecting into the interior of the calyces ; each calyx receives from one to three papill.-e. The cortical portion (substantia corticahs) is reddish-brown in colour and soft and granular in consistence. It hes immediately beneath the capsule, arches over the bases of the pyi-amids, and diiis in between adjacent pyramids towards the renal sinus. The part« dipping in lietween the pyramids are named the cortical columns (columna3 renales fBertim]). while the portions which connect the cortical columns to eacli other and intervene between the bases of the pyramids and the capsule are called the corticM arches (indicated bet\yeen A and a' in fig. 980). If the cortex beexammed with a lens, it will be seen to consist of a series of lighter-coloured, conical are^s. termed medulhn/ rays (pars radiata) and a darker- colo^xred intervening substance, which from the -"M^lexity of its str^^^^^^ labyrinth (pars convoluta).

976 NEUROLOGY sheath of the femoral artery, and divides in front, or at the inner side of that vessel, into two branches, an anterior and a posterior or internal. The anterior branch runs downwards on the Sartorius, perforates the fascia lata at the lower third of tlie thigh, and divides into two branches : one supplies the integument as low down as the inner side of the knee; the otlier crosses to the outer side of the patella, communicating in its course with the patellar branch of the long saphenous nerve. The 'posterior or internal branch descends along the inner border of the Sartorius muscle to the knee, where it pierces the fascia lata, communicates with the long saphenous nerve, and gives o£E several cutaneous branches. It then passes down to supply the integument of the inner side of the leg. Beneath the fascia lata, at the lower border of the Adductor longus, it joms to form a plexiform network [subsartorial plexus) with branches of the long saphenous and obturator nerves (fig. 808). When the communicating branch from the obturator nerve is large and continued to the mtegument of the leg, the internal branch of the internal cutaneous is small, and terminates m the plexus, occasionally giving ofE a few cutaneous filaments. ^ i- . The internal cutaneous nerve, before dividing, gives off a few falaments, which pierce the fascia lata, to supply the integument of the mner side of the tliicrh accompanying the long saphenous vem. One of these filaments passes throucrh the saphenous opening ; a second becomes subcutaneous about the middle of the thigh ; a thu-d pierces the fascia at its lower third.

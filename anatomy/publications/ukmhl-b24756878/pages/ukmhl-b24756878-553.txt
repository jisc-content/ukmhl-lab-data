MUSCLES AND FASCIA OF SHOULDER AND ARM 535 two-thirds of the groove on the axillary border of the bone. Some fibres arise from tendinous laminae which intersect the muscle and are attached to ridges on the bone ; others from an aponeurosis, which separates the muscle from the Teres major and the long head of the Triceps. The fibres pass outwards, and, gi-adually converging, terminate in a tendon which is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus and the front of the capsular liga- ment of the shoulder-joint. The tendon of the muscle is separated from the neck of the scapula and anterior part of the capsular ligament of the shoulder- joint by a large bursa, which communicates with the cavity of the joint by an aperture in the capsular ligament. Fig. 520.—Muscles on the dorsum of the scapula and the Triceps. Relations.—The anterior surface of this muscle forms a considerable part of the posterior wall of the axilla, and is in relation with the Serratus magnus, Coraco-brachialis, and Biceps, the axillary vessels and brachi^il plexus of nerves, and the subscapular vessels and nerves. Its posterior surface is in relation \vith the scapula and the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint. Its lower border is in contact with the Teres major and Latissimus dorsi. Nerves.—The Subscapularis is supplied by the fifth and sixth cervical nerves through the upper and lower subscapular nerves. Actions.—The Subscapularis rotates the head of the humerus inwards; when the arm is raised, it draws the humerus forwards and downwards. It is a powerful defence to the front of the shoulder joint, preventing displacement of the head of the bone. 5. Posterior Scapular Region (fig. 520) Supraspinatus. Teres minor. Infraspinatus.

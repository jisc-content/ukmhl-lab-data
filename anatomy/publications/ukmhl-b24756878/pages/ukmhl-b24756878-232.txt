OSTEOLOGY 214 According to the Basle nomenclature, certain bones developed in associa- tion with the nasal capsule, viz. the inferior turbinateds, the laclirymals the nasals, and the vomer, are grouped as cranial and not as facial bones. The Hyoid bone, situated at tlie root of tlie tongue and attached to the base of the skull by ligaments, has also to be considered in this section. OSSA CRANII The] Occipital Bone The occipital bone (os occipitale) (figs. 285 and 286), situated at the back and lo^yer part of the cranium, is trapezoid in shape and much curved on itself. It is pierced by a large oval aperture, the foramen magnum, through which the cranial cavity communicates Avith the vertebral canal. The curved, expanded plate behind the foramen magnum is named the tabular or squamous portion ; the thick, somewhat quadrilateral piece in front of the foramen is called the basilar process, whilst that on either side of the foramen constitutes the lateral or condylic portion. Fig. 285.â€”Occipital bone. Outer surface. The tabular portion (squama occipitalis), situated above and behind tlie foramen magnum, is curved from above downwards and from side to side. The external surface is convex and presents midway between the summit of the bone and the foramen magnum a prominence, the inioii or external occipital protuberance (protuberantia occipitalis externa). Extending outwards from this on either side are two curved lines, one a little above the other. The upper, often faintly marked, is named the highest curved line (linea nucliae suprema) and to it the epicranial aponeurosis is attached. The lo\\ er is termed the superior curved line (linea nuchas superior). That part of the squama which lies above the lineae supreniEe is named the jylanum occipitale, and is

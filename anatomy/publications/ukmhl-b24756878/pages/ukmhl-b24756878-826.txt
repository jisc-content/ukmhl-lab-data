808 NEUROLOGY different levels. In the cervical and upper thoracic rec/ions, they appear as a comma-shaped strand (descending comma trad of Sclmltze) in the outer part of the fasciculus cuneatus, the blunt end of the comma being du^ected towards the posterior grey commissure; in the lower thoracic region they form a thm band (dorsal wripheral band) on the posterior sui-face of the column ; m the lumbar region, they are situated by tlie side of the posterior median fissure, and liere appear on section as a semi-eUiptical bundle, whicli, together with the correspondmg bundle of the opposite side, forms the oval area of Flechsuj ; while in tlie conus medullaris they assume the form of a triangular strand m the postero-mternal part of the fasciculus gracilis These descendmg fibres are mainly intersegmental m character, and derived from cells in the posterior horn, but some may consist of the descendmg branches of the posterior nerve- roots. The descending comma tract was supposed to belong to the sec-ond category, but against this view is the fact that it does not undergo descendmg degeneration when the posterior nerve-roots are destroyed. Roots of the spinal nerves.-As already stated, each spmal nerve possesses two roots, an anterior and a posterior, which are attached to the ^^rfac^e o t e cord opposite the correspondmg lioin Fig. 683.—A spinal nerve with its anterior and posterior roots. (Testut.) of grey matter (fig. 683) ; their fibres become medullated about the fifth month of foetal life. The anterior nerve-roots consist of efferent fibres, which are the axons of the nerve-cells m the ventral part of the anterior horn. A short distance from their origins, these axons are invested by medullary sheaths and, passing forwards and slightly outwards, emerge on the surface of the cord m two or three irregular rows over an area which measures about three millimetres in width. The 'posterior root of each spmal nerve comprises some six or eight fasciculi which are attached m Imear series along the postero-lateral sulcus. It consists of afferent fibres winch arise from the nerve-cells ui the spmal ganglia. Each ganglion-ceU, at first round or oval, is elongated into two IDrocesses, an internal (axon) and an external (dendrite), and so becomes a bipolar nerve-cell. These two pro- cesses graduaUv undergo approxima- tion, and finally arise from a smg e Ixternal are directed towards the penpl^ery. ^^. ,^1 ^^^^ mediate and an external bundle.

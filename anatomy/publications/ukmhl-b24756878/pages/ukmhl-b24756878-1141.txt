THE PERITONEUM 1123 surface of the anterior part of the Diapliragm, and is continued from it on to the upper surface of the right lobe of the liver as the superior layer of the coronary ligament, and on to the upper surface of the left lobe as the superior layer of the left lateral ligament of the liver. Covering the upper and anterior surfaces of the liver, it is continued round its sharp margin on to the under surface, where it presents the following relations : (a) It covers the under surface of the right lobe and is reflected from the back part of this on to the upper extremity of the right kidney, forming in this situation the inferior layer of the coronary ligament; from the kidney it is carried doM'n- wards to the duodenum and hepatic flexure of the colon and inwards to the inferior vena cava, where it is continuous mth the posterior w&Vl of the lesser sac. Bet^\'een the two layers of the coronary ligament there is a large triangular surface of the liver devoid of peritoneal covering : this Fig. 924.â€”Posterior view of the anterior abdominal wall in its lower halt. The peritonexim is in place, and the various cords are shining through. (After Joessel.) External inguinal fossa External iliac artery External iliac vein Femoral fossa Superior vesical artery Middle inguinal fossa Internal inguinal fo IS named the bare area of the liver, and is attached to the Diaphragm by areolar tissue. Towards the right margin of the liver the two layers of the coronary ligament gradually approach each other, and ultimately fuse to form a small triangular fold connecting the liglit lobe of the liver to the Diaphragm, and named the right lateral ligament of the liver. The apex of the triangular bare area corresponds with the point of meeting of the two layers of the coronary ligament, its base with the fossa for the mferior vena cava. (6) It covers the lower surface of the quadrate lobe, the under and lateral surfaces of the gall-bladder, and tlie under surface and posterior border of the left lobe ; it is then reflected from the upper surface of the hver to the Diaphragm as tlie inferior layer of the left lateral ligament, and from the transverse fissure and fissure for the ductus venosus to the Icsser^urvature of the stomach as the anterior Uyev of the gastro-hepatic, or 4 c 2

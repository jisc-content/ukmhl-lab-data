NEUROLOGY nerve are attached. The external arcuate fibres wind across the lower part of the pyramid and olivary body to enter tlie restiform body The Dosterior area (fig. 690) lies behmd the postero-lateral sulcus and the roots of the spinal accessory, vagus, and the glosso-pharyngeal nerves, and like the lateral area, is divisible mto a lower and an upper portion. The loiver part is limited behind by the posterior median fissure, and consists of the fasciculus gracilis and the fasciculus cuneatus Tlie fasciculus ^acihs is a narrow white band placed parallel to and a ong the side of the posterior Sedian fissure, and separated from the fasciculus cuneatus by the postero- StSmediate furrow aAd septum. The gracile and cuneate fascicuh are at, first vertical m direction ; but at the lower part of the floor of the fourth Fia. 690.â€”Upper part of spinal cord and hind- and mid-brains ; posterior aspect, exposed in situ.

OSTEOLOGY 290 The ridge serves for the attachment of a strong aponeurosis, which separates the Infraspinatus from the two Teres muscles. The surface of bone between the ridge and the axillary border is narrow in the upper two-thirds of its extent, and is crossed near its centre by a groove for the passage of the dorsalis scapula3 vessels ; it affords attachment to the Teres minor. Its lower third presents a broader, somewhat triangular surface, which gives origin to the Teres major, and over which the Latissimus dorsi glides ; frequently the Fig. 350.—Left scapula.

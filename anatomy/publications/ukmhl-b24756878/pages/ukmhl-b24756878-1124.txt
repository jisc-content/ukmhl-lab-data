SPLANCHNOLOGY 1106 oral cavity The mucous membrane of tlie dorsum of the tongue behind the foramen CMCum and sulcus terminalis is thick and freely movable over the subjacent parts. It contains a large number of lymplioid follicles, which together constitute what is sometiiiios termed the lingual tonsil (tonsiUa hngualis). Each follicle forms a rounded eminence, the centre of wiiich is perforated by a minute orifice leadmg into a funnel- shaped cavity or recess ; around this recess are grouped numerous oval or rounded nodulers of lymphoid tissue, each enveloped by a capsule derived from the submucosa, while ooemne into the bottom of the recesses are also seen the ducts of mucous glands. Ihe mucous membrane on the anterior part of the dorsum of the tongue is thin, intunately adherent to the muscular tissue, and presents numerous minute surface eminences, the fafillcB of the tongue. It consists of a layer of connective tissue, the corium or muwsa, covered with epithelium. ., . , , . i • The epithehum is of the scaly variety, like that of the epidermis, but is much thmner than that of the skin: the intervals between the large papillae are not fi led up by it, but each papUla has a separate investment from root to summit. The deepest cdk may sometimes be detached as a separate layer, correspondmg to the rete mucosum, but they never contain colourmg matter. ... The cormm consist! of a dense felt-work of fibrous connective ti.ssue with numerous elastic fibres, firmly connected vvith the fibrous tissue forming the septa between the muscular bundles o^f the tongue. It contains the ramifications of the numerous vessels Fig. 915.—Section of papilla foliata of a rabbit. (Magnified.) PapillcB Taste- buds and nerves from which the papillas are supplied, large plexuses of lymphatic vessels, and the glands of the tongue. Structure of the papiUcc (fig. 915).—The papilla! appa- rently resemble ui structm-e those of the cutte, consistmg of cone- shaped projections of connective tissue, covered with a thick layer of squamous epithehum, and containing one or more capillary loops, among which nerves are distributed m gi-eat abundance. If the epithelium be removed, it mil be found that they are not sunple elevations Kke the papilla- of the skm, for the surface of each is studded with minute conical i)rocesses which form secondary papillae. In the papillffi ckcumvallatoe, the nerves are numerous and of large size : in the papillte fungiformes they _ are also numerous, and termi- nate in a plexiform network, from which brush-like branches proceed; in^Jhe papilte fihformes, theh mode of ^^^XSV^^^oS^^The tongue is provided with ~ "^^^ ^"%,ey are The mucous glands are similar in structm-e to the labial and l^"^^^'f'^'^f 'A^i^nt found especially at the back part behind the cu;cumvallate J"/^^VJ.V em^^^ at the apex and marginal parts.

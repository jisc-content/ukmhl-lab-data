706 ANGIOLOGY artery. The vessel may be secured in any part of its course, excepting near its upper end, which is to be avoided on account of the proximity of the internal iliac, and near its lower end. which should also be avoided on account of the proximity of the deep epieastric and circumdox iliac vessels. The operation may be performed by opening the abdomen and incising the peritoneum over the artery {transpenloneal) ; or by an incision in the iUac region, dividing all the structures down to the peritoneum, which is then rctlected inwards unopened from the iliac fossa until the artery is reached [retroperitoneal). j . xi. -i Transperitoneal ligature.—An incision four inches in length is made in the semilunai Une commencing about an inch below the umbiHcus, and carried tlirough the abdominal wall into the peritoneal cavity. The intestines are then pushed upwards and held out ot the way by a broad abdominal retractor, and an incision made through the peritoneuni at the margin of the pelvis in the course of the artery : the vessel is secured in any part ot its course which may seem desirable to the operator. The advantages of this operation appear to be, that if it is found necessary the common iliac artery can be ligatured instead of the external iliac mthout extension or modification of the mcision ; and secondly, that the vessel can be ligatured without in any way interfering with the sac of an aneurysm. ^ The retroperitoneal ligature may be performed either by the modified Abernethy s method, which consists m making an uicision from an inch above and mternal to the anterior superior spine of the ilium in a curved direction, with its convexity outwards and downwards to a point an inch and a half above the middle of Poupart s ligament; or by Astley Cooper's method, in which an incision is made in a curved direction from a little above and outside the external abdominal ring to an inch from the in^^er side o the anterior superior spmous process of the iUum. In both, the abdominal mascles and transversaUs fascia ha^g been cautiously divided, the peritoneum should ^ separated from the iliac fossa and raised towards the pelvis ; and on introducing t e fmger to the bottom of the wound, the artery may be fe t pulsating along the • muscle. The external iliac vem is generaUy found on the mnei side of the artery and must be cautiously separated from it by the finger-nail or handle of the kni^e and the aneurysm needle should be introduced on the inner side, between the artery and vem. Collateral Circulation.-The prmcipal anastomoses m carrymg on cu-culation after the application of a Ugature to the external ihac, are: the iho-lumba,r S the clrcumaex iUac ; the gluteal ^^th the external circumflex ; the obturator with Ifint-nar« ; the sci'atic with the -P-ior f rforatmg and c^^^^^^ of the profunda artery ; and the mternal pudic with the external pudic. \N hen tne obturator arises from the epigastric, it is supplied with blood by branches, from either the ^tlr^ Uac tie L sicrll, or the internal pudic.

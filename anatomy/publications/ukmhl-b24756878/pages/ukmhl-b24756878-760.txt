742 ANGIOLOGY The inferior opthalmic vein (v. ophtlialmica inferior) receives the veins from the floor of the orbit, and either passes out of the orbit through the spheno- maxillary fissure to join the pterygoid plexus of veins ; or else, passing back- wards through the sphenoidal fissure, it enters the cavernous sinus, either by a separate opening, or more frequently in common with the superior ophthalmic vein The circular sinus (smus curcularis) (fig. 635) is formed by two transverse vessels, the anterior and posterior intercavernous sinuses, which connect together the two cavernous sinuses ; one passes m front of and the other behind the pituitary body, and thus they form with the cavernous smuses a venous circle around that body. The anterior one is usually the larger of the two and one or other is occasionally absent. _ _ . , i The superior petrosal sinus (smus petrosus superior) is situated along the superior border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, m the attached margin of the tentorium. It is small and naiTow, and connects the cavernous and lateral sinuses, opening into the latter as it curves down- wards on the inner surface of the mastoid part of the temporal bone. It receives Fig. 63.5.—The sinuses at the base of the skull.

ORGANS OP SPECIAL SENSE 1026 Struchire.—The lens is made up of an outer, soft part (substantia corticalis) and a central, firm part (nucleus lentis) (fig. 845). Faint lines (radii lentis) radiate from the poles to the equator. In the adult there may be six or more of these lines, but in tlie f(Btus they are only three in number and diverge from each other at angles of 120 degrees (fig. 846). On the anterior surface one line ascends vertically and the other two diverge downwards and outwards. On the posterior surface one ray descends vertically and the other two diverge upwards. They correspond with the fi'ee edges of an equal number of septa composed of an amorphous substance, which dip into the substance of the lens. When the lens has been hardened it is seen to consist of a series of concentrically arranged lamina), each of which is interrupted at the septa referred to. Each lamina is built up of a number of hexagonal, ribbon-like fibres (fibrse lentis) the edges of which are more or less serrated—the serrations fitting between those of neighbouring fibres, while the ends of the fibres come into apposition at the septa. The fibres run in a curved manner fi'om the septa on the anterior surface to those on the posterior surface. No fibres pass from pole to pole ; they are arranged in such a way that those which commence near the pole on one aspect of the lens terminate near the peripheral extremity of the plane on the Fig. 846.—Diagram to show the direction and arrangement of the radiating lines on the front and back of the foetal lens. A. From the front, b. From the back. other and vice versa. The fibres of the outer layers of the lens are nucleated and together form a layer (nuclear layer) on the surface of the lens, most distinct towards its circumference. The anterior surface of the lens is covered bv a layer of transparent, columnar, nucleated cells (epithehum lentis). At the equator the cells become elongated, and theh: gradual transition mto lens fibres can be traced (fig. 847). , . , j, r i+i„ .^^ri^oin tinf • In the foetus, the lens is nearly spherical, and has a slightly reddish tint , it is not perfectly transparent, and is so soft as to break down readily on the slightest pressure.

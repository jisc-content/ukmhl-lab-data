The fascia covering the Psoas and Iliacus is the layer which lines the back part of the abdominal cavity. It is thin above, and becomes graduaUy thicker below as it approaches Poupart's hgament. The vortion covering the Psoas is tliickened above to form the ligamentum arcuatum internum, which stretches from the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra to the body of tlie second ; mternaUy it is attached liy a series of arched processes to the intervertebral discs, and promment margins of the bodies of the vertebrae, and to the upper part of the sacrum ; the intervals left, opposite the constricted portions of the bodies, transmit Se lumbar krteries and veins and filaments of the sympathetic cord. Externally, above the crest of the ilium, this portion of the fascia is con- tinuous with the anterior lamella of the lumbar fascia covering the front of the Quadi-atus lumborum (see page 493), but below the crest of the ilium it is continuous with the fascia covering the Iliacus. . . u The vortion investing the Iliacus (fascia iliaca) is connected, externally to the whole length of the inner border of the crest of the ilium ; and internally. tft e brim of the true pelvis, where it is contmuous with the penosteum At the ilio-pectineal eminence it receives the tendon of msertion of the Psoas parvus, when that muscle exists. External to the femoral vessels, this fasda ?s StTmately connected to the posterior margm of Poupart's ligament, and I cont^Zous^with the fascia transversalis. Immechately to the outer sSe of the floral vessels the fascia iliaca is prolonged backwards and im_j^^^^^^ from Poupart's ligament as a band, the ilio-pectineal ligament which is attached to the XpecS eminence. This ligament divides the space between Pnu^LtTlSament and the innominate bone into two parts, the inner of wS trLsS th^^ femoral vessels, the outer the Ilio-psoas and the anterior crara neive^fig 444) Internal to the vessels the iliac fascia is attached to too-a vSsl telri attard to the ilio-poetineal lino beyond the hra>U o of the transverse processes of all the ^^'"'^'Y/ l ^f f^.oln^f thoracic and all the bodies and the corresponding i^terver eW discs of^ eat ^^^^^^ lumbar vertebree by five slips, each of w nch '^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ .

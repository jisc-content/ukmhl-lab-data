113 DEVELOPMENT OP THE LIMBS The Limbs.—The limbs begin to make their appearance in the third week as small elevations or buds at the side of the trunk (fig. 145). Prolongations from the muscle- and cutis-plates of several primitive segments extend into each bud, and carry with them tbe anterior divisions of the corresponding spinal nerves. Pinna Eye The axial part of the mesoderm of the limb bud becomes condensed and converted into its cartilaginous skeleton, and by the ossification of this the bones of tlie limbs are formed. By the sixth week the three chief divisions of tlie limb are marked ofE by furrows—the upper into arm, forearm, and hand ; the lower into thigh, leg, and foot (fig. 146). The limbs are at first directed backwards nearly Fig. 146.—Embryo of about six weeks. (His.) parallel to the long axis of the trunk, and each presents two surfaces and two borders. Of the surfaces, one—the future flexor surface of the limb—is directed ventrally; the other, the exlensw ■ surface, dorsally; while one border, the fre-axial, looks for- ward towards the cephalic end of the embryo, and the other, the post-axial, backwards towards the caudal end. The external con- dyle of the humerus, the radius and the thumb lie along the pre- axial border in the case of the upper limb; and the internal condyle of the femur, the tibia and the great toe along the corre- sponding border of the lower limb. The pre-axial part is derived from the anterior seg- ments, the post-axial from the posterior segments of the limb bud; and this explains, to a large extent, the innervation of the adult limb, the nerves of the more anterior segments being distributed along the pre-axial (radial or tibial), and those of the more posterior along the post-axial (ulnar or fibular) border of the limb.

PHALANGES 361 phalanges. The fii-st metatarsal articulates with the internal cuneiform, the second''with all three cuneiforms, the third with the external cuneiform, the fourth with the external cuneiform and the cuboid, and the fifth with the cuboid. Phalanges The Phalanges (phalanges digitorum pedis), both in number and general arrangement, resemble those of the hand ; there being two in the great toe, and three in each of the other toes. They differ from them, how- over, m their size, the shafts being much reduced in length, and, especially in the first row, laterally compressed. The phalanges of the first row closely resemble those of the hand. The sluift of each is compressed from side to side, convex above, concave below. The posterior extremity is concave ; and the anterior extremity presents a troclilear surface for articulation with the second phalanx. Fig. 416.—^Plan of ossification of the foot. TABSUS.

The ungual phalanges, in form, resemble those of the fingers ; but they are smaller, flattened from above downwards ; each presents a broad base tor articulation with the corresponding bone of the second row, and an expanded extremity for the support of the nail and end of the toe. Articulations.—In the foiu-outer toes, the phalanges of the first row articulate behind with the metatarsal bones, and in front with the second phalanges, which

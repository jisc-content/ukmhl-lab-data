978 NEUROLOGY on the surface of this muscle to near the joint; it then penetrates the muscular fibres and accompanies the deep branch of the anastomotica magna artery, pierces the capsular ligament of the joint on its inner side, and supplies tlie synovial membrane. The third branch is derived from the nerve to the Crureus. SACRAL AM) COCCYGEAL NERVES (NN. SACRALES ET COCCYGEUS) The anterior primary divisions of the sacral and coccygeal nerves form tlie sacral and pudendal plexuses. The anterior divisions of the upper four sacral nerves enter the pelvis through the anterior .sacral foramina, that of the fifth between the sacrum and coccyx, while that of the coccygeal nerve curves forwards below the rudimentary transverse process of the hrst piece of the coccvx The first and second sacral are large ; the thu-d, tourth, and fifth diminish progressively from above downwards. Each nerve receives a qrey ramus communicans from the corresponding ganglion of the sympathetic iord, while from the third, and frequently from the second and fourth sac-ral nerves white rami communicantes are given to the pelvic plexuses of the sympathetic. Sacbal Plexus (Plexus Sacealis) The sacral plexus (fig. 809) is formed by the lumbo-sacral cord, the anterior primary Son of the first, and portions of the anterior primary divisions of the second and third sacral nerves.

THE EAR 1037 The AiUitragicus arises from the outer part of the antitragus : its fibres are inserted into the cauda helicis and antihelix. Tliis muscle is usually very distinct. The Transversus auricula is placed on the cranial surface of the pinna. It consists of scattered fibres, partly tendinous and partly muscular, extending from the convexity of the concha to the prominence corresponding with the groove of the helix. i^G. 856.â€”A front view of the organ of hearing. Right side. The Ohliquus auriculce consists of a few fibres extending from the upper and back part of the concha to the convexity immediately above it. The arteries of the pinna are the posterior auricular from the external carotid, the- anterior auricular from the temporal, and an auricular branch from the occipital artery. The veins accompany the corresponding arteries. The nerves are: the great auricular, from the cervical plexus ; the auricular branch- of the pneumogastric ; the auriculo-temporal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve ; the small occipital from the cervical plexus, and the great occipital or internal branch of the posterior primary division of the second cervical nerve. The muscles of the pinna are- supplied by the facial nerve. Tlie auditory canal (meatus acusticus externus) extends from the bottom of the concha to the membrana tympani (figs. 856, 857). It is about an inch and.

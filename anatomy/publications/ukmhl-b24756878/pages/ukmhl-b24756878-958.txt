NEUROLOGY 940 The communication with the pneumogastric takes place close to the exit of the nerve from the skull, numerous filaments passing between the hypoglossal and the "anglion of the trunk of the pneumogastric through the mass of con- nective tissue which unites the two nerves. It also communicates with the pharyngeal plexus by a minute filament as it winds round the occipital arteiy. The^communication with the sympathetic takes place opposite the atlas by branches derived from the superior cervical ganghon, and in the same situation the nerve is jomed by a filament derived from the loop connectmg the first two cervical nerves. , , , i.i i. • i j„„ The commmiication with the Ungual takes place near the anterior border of the Hyo-glossus muscle by numerous filaments which ascend upon it.

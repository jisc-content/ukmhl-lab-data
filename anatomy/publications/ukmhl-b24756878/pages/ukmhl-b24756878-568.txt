MYOLOGY 550 to the finger when the muscles act. The condition is known as tenoaynovUis, and the coarse grating is quite distinctive. Paralysis of tlio Extensor muscles of the wists and fingers is common in acute or chronic lead-poisoning, and is known as ' wi'ist-drop.' The Brachio-radialis usually escapes in these cases, unless the muscles of the upper arm are paralysed also. Usually the different Extensor muscles are affected to different extents ; thus the thuml), or index, or little finger, may bo but slightly implicated, and may recover rapidly while the Extensors of the other fingers or the wrist remain powerless. Some paresis is often shown by the Flexors of the fingers also, these muscles being thrown into a state of ti'emor whenever extension of the fingers is attempted. Atrophy often foUows paralysis in lead j)oisoning. IV.

298 OSTEOLOGY origins of the Bracliialis anticus and Pronator teres, a posterior lip for the internal head of the Triceps, and an intermediate space for the attachment of the internal intermuscular septum. The external surface (facies anterior lateralis) is directed outwards above, where it is smooth, rounded, and covered by the Deltoid; forwards and outwards below, where it is slightly concave from above do^\^lwards, and gives origin to part of the Bracliialis anticus muscle. About the middle of this surface is a rough, triangular elevation (tuberositas deltoidea) for the insertion of the Deltoid; below this is the musculo-spiral groove, directed obhquely from behind, forwards, and downwards, and transmitting the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery. The internal surface (facies anterior medialis), less extensive than the external, is directed inwards above, forwards and inwards below; its upper part is narrow, and forms the floor of the bicipital groove which gives insertion to the tendon of the Latissimus dorsi; its middle part is slightly rough for the attachment of some of the fibres of the tendon of insertion of the Coraco-brachiahs ; its lower part is smooth, concave from above downwards, and gives origm to the Brachialis anticus.* The posterior surface (facies posterior) appears somewhat twisted, so that its upper part is directed a little inwards, its lower part backwards and a little outwards. Nearly the whole of this surface is covered by the external and internal heads of the Triceps, the former arising from its upper and outer part, the latter from its inner and back part, the two heads being separated by the musculospiral groove. The lower extremity is flattened from before backwards, and curved slightly forwards ; it terminates below in a broad, articular surface, which is divided into two parts by a slight ridge. Projecting on either side are the external and internal epicondyles. The articular surface extends a httle lower than the epicondyles, and is curved slightly forwards ; its greatest breadth is in the transverse diameter, and it is obliquely directed, so that its inner extremity occupies a lower level than the outer. The outer portion of the articular surface presents a smooth, rounded eminence, named the capitellum, or radial head of the humerus (capitulum humeri) ; it articulates with the cup- shaped depression on the head of the radius, and is limited to the front and lower part of the bone. On the inner side of this eminence is a shallow groove, in which is received the inner margin of the liead of the radius. Above the front part of the capitellum is a shght depression, the fossa radialis, which receives the anterior border of the head of the radius, when the forearm is flexed. The inner portion of the articular surface, the trochlea humeri, presents a deep depression between two well-marked borders. The troclilea is convex from before backwards, concave from side to side, and occupies the anterior, lower, and posterior parts of the extremity. The external border, less pro- minent than the mternal, separates it from the groove which articulates with the margin of the head of the radius. The internal border is tlucker of greater length, and consequently more prominent, than the external. The grooved portion of the articular surface fits accurately A\ithin the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna ; it is broader and deeper on the posterior than on the anterior aspect of the bone, and is inchned obhquely from behmd forwards, and from without inwards. Above the front part of the trochlear surface is a small depression, the fossa corojioidea, which receives the eoronoid process ot the uhia during flexion of the forearm. Above the back part of the trochlea is a deep triangular depression, the oZecrawo/i/ossa (fossa olecrani), in winch * A small, hook-shaped process of bono, the siqiracondi/l^r process, varying from i to t ol an inch in length, is not infrequently found projecting from the mner ^"'•f-'*'=%°f ^^^^X^,^^^^ the humerus two inches above the internal epicondyle.

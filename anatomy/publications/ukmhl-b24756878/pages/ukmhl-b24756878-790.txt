772 ANGIOLOGY The anterior cervical glands form an irregular and inconstant group on the front of the larynx and trachea. They may be divided into : (a) a superficial set, placed on the anterior jugular vein ; (6) a deeper set, which is further subdivided into pre-laryngeal, on the crico-thyroid membrane, and pre-tracheal, on the front of the trachea. Tliis deeper set drains the lower part of the larynx, the thyroid body, and the upper part of the trachea ; its efferents pass to the lower glands of the upper deep cervical group. r , ,c cca The deep cervical glands (lymphoglandulae cervicales profundaj) (hgs. b5U, 653) are numerous and of large size; they form a chain along the carotid sheath, lying by the side of the pharynx, oesophagus, and trachea, and extending from the base of the skuU to the root of the neck. They are usually described m two groups • (1) an iipper or substerno-mastoid group (lymphoglandulae cervicales profundfe superiores) lymg under the Sterno-mastoid in close relation with the spinal accessory nerve and the internal jugular vein, some of the glands lying in front of and others behind the vessel; (2) a lower or swpradamcular^ow^ (Ivmphoglandula? cervicales profundse inferiores) extendmg beyond the posterior margm of the Sterno-mastoid mto the supraclavicular triangle, where they are closely related to the brachial plexus and subclavian vem. A few minute glands are situated alongside the recurrent laryngeal nerves on the lateral aspects of the trachea and oesophagus. The upper deep cervical glands drain the occipital portion of the scalp, the puma, and the back of the Lck, the tongue, larynx, thyroid body, trachea naso-pharynx, nasal fossae palate, and Esophagus. They receive also the efferent vessels from aU the other glands of the head and neck, except those from the ower deep cervical group. The lower deep cervical glands dram the back of the scali and neck, the superficial pectoral region, part of the arm (see page / /5), and occasionally part of the upper surface of the hver. In addition, the :rceWe veTsSs^fro^m the upper'^group. The efferents of^the up^er d^ep cervical glands pass partly to the lower group and partly to a tr,^ wine unites with the efferent trunk of the lower deep cervical glands and foi ?he jugular trur^k (truncus jugularis). This trunk, on the "ght side, ends the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian vems, while on the le side it joins the thoracic duct. , . .7 7 f^. +hp Hpp Ih^ lymphaiic vessels of the skin and muscles of the ^^fci pass to the dee cervici glands.

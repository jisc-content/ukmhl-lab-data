SPLANCHNOLOGY 1186 Fig. 984.—^Uriniferous tube. continuous layer of squamous cells ; this cavity varies in size according to the state of secretion and the amount of fluid present in it. In the fojtus and young subject the cells are polyhedral or even columnar. The lubuU unni/eri, commencing in the Malpighian bodies, present, during then- course, many changes in shape and direction, and are contained partly in the medullary and partly in the cortical portions of the organ. At their junction with the Malpighian capsule they exliibit a somewhat constricted portion, which is termed the neck. Bej'ond this the tube becomes convoluted, and pursues a considerable course in the cortical structure constituting the 'proximal convoluted tube. After a time the convolutions disappear, and the tube approaches the medullary portion of the kidney in a more or less spiral manner; this section of the tube has been called the apiral tube. Throughout this portion of their coui'se the tubuli miniferi ai-e contained entkely in the cortical structure, and present a fairly uniform calibre. They now enter the medullary portion, suddenly become much smaller, quite straight in direction, and dip down for a variable depth into the pjTamids, constituting the descending limb of Henle's loop. Bending on themselves, they form what is termed the loop of Henle, and re-ascending, they become suddenly enlarged and again spiral in direction, forming the ascending limb of Henle's loop, and re-enter the cortical sti-uc- ture. This portion of the tube does not present a uniform calibre, but becomes narrower as it ascends, and is ii-regular in outline. As a narrow tube it enters the cortex and ascends for a short distance, when it again becomes dilated, irregular, and angular. This section is termed the zig-zag tvbule; it terminates in a convoluted tube, which exactly resembles the proximal convoluted tubule, and is called the distal convo- luted- tubule. This again ter- minates in a narrow junctional tube, which enters the straight or collecting tube. The straight or collecting tubes commence in the medullary rays of the cortex, where they receive the curved extremities of the distal convoluted tubules. They unite at short intervals mth one another, the resulting tubes presenting a considerable increase in calibre, so that a series of comparatively large tubes passes from the bases of the medullary rays into the medullary pyramids. In the medulla the tubes of each pyramid converge to join a central tube which finally opens on the summit of one of the papUlaj; the contents of the tube are therefore discharged into one of the calyces. It mil be seen from the above description that the tubes are continuous f^m tfie.' commencement in the Malpighian bodies to their termination at the °" of the pyramids of Malpighi; and that the urine, the secretion ° /^^ij^^^^-^'^f.^^"^,, " the capsule, will find its wly through these tubes into the calyces of th-^ ladney. ^nd o into the ureter.

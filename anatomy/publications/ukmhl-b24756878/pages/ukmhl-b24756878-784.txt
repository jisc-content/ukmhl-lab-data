The thoracic duct has several valves: at its termination it is provided with a pair of valves, the fi-ee borders of which are turned towards the vem, so as to prevent the nassage of venous blood into the duct. „ . ^, , i u ^ Thereceptaculum chyli (cisterna chyli) (fig. 648 receives the two lumbar lymphatic trunks, right and left, and the intestinal lymphatic trunk.

793 LYMPHATICS OP THE THORAX Tlie lymphatic vessels of the pleura consist of two setsâ€”one in the visceral and another in tlie parietal part of the membrane. Those of the visceral pleura dram into the superficial efferents of the lung, while the lymphatics of the parietal jjleura have three modes of ending, viz. : (a) those of the costal portion join the lymphatics of tlie Internal intercostal muscles and so reach the internal mammary glands ; (6) those of the diaphragmatic part are di'ained by the efferents of the Diaphragm ; while (c) those of the mediastinal portion terminate in the posterior mediastinal glands. The lymplmtic vessels of the thymus gland terminate in the superior mediastinal, tracheo-bronchial, and internal mammary glands. The lymphatic vessels of the oesophagus form a plexus round that tube, and the collecting vessels from the plexus drain into tlie posterior mediastinal glands.

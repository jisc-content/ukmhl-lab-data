820 NEUROLOGY appears on transverse section as a curved lamina on the dorsal aspect of the inferior oUvary nucleus. The inferior olivary nucleus is connected—(1) with that of the opposite side by fibres which cross throush the raphe ; (2) with the anterior lioni ol the same side of the spinal cord by a strand of fibres termed the spino-ohvar,/ tract ■ (3) with the thalamus of the cerebrum by the cerebro-ohvary trurl which passes through the pons Varolii and tegmentum ; (4) with the opposite cerebellar hemisphere by the cerebello-olivary tract, the fibres of which pa. across the raphe and turn backwards to enter the deep part of the restifoxu. body. Removal of one cerebellar hemisphere is followed by atrophy of the opposite olivary nucleus. 6. The nucleus arcuaius wiU be described Mith the anterior external arcuate fibres (page 821). ■^ra 699 — Primary terminal nuclei of the afferent (sensory) cranial nerves schematically represented ; lateral view.

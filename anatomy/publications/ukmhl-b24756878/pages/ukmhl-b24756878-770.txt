752 regions. They are not of uniform size througliout, being alternately enlarged and constricted. At the intervertebral foramina they communicate with the posterior spinal plexus, and with the vertebral veins in the neck, with the intercostal veins in the thoracic region, and with the lumbar and sacral vems m the corresponding regions. „ , , • v ^ i The posterior longitudinal sfinal veins, smaller than the antenor, are situatea one on either side, between the inner surfaces of the laminaj and the dura mater. Thev communicate (like the anterior), opposite the vertebrae, by transverse trunks ; and" with the anterior longitudinal veins, by lateral transverse branches, which pass from behind forwards. They join with the posterior spinal plexus by branches which perforate the ligamenta subflava, and communicate through the mterverte- bral foramina with the vertebral, intercostal, lumbar, and sacral vems. 3 The veins of the bodies of the vertebrae (w. basivertebrales) emerge from the foramina on the posterior sm-faces of the vertebral bodies. They are contained in larae tortuous channels in the substance of the bones, similar in every respect to those found in the diploc of the cranial bones. They communicate through small openings on the front and sides of the bodies of the vertebrae with the anterior spinal plexus, and converge to the principal canal which is sometimes double towards its posterior part, and open into the transverse branches which umte the anterior longitudinal veins. They become greatly enlarged in advanced age. 4 The veins of the spinal cord are situated in the pia mater and torni a minute, tortuous, venous plexus covering the entire surface of the cord. iJiey emerge chiefly fi'om the median furrows of the cord and are largest m the lumbar re-ion. In this plexus there are : (1) two median longitudmal vems, one m front of'the anterior fissure, and the other behind the posterior fissure of the cord and (2) four lateral longitudinal veins which run behind the nerve-roots. Wear the base of the skull they unite, and form two or three small trunks, ^t^^h com- rnunicate with the vertebral veins, and then terminate m the inferior cerebel ar W ' or in the inferior petrosal sinuses. Bach of the spinal nerves is accompanied by a branch as far as the intervertebral foramen; here this branch ]oms the other veins from the spinal canal. There are no valves in the spinal veins.

III. The Retina The retina is a delicate nervous membrane, upon the surface of which the images of external objects are received. Its outer surface is in contact with the choroid ; its inner with the vitreous body. Beliind, it is continuous with the optic nerve ; it gradually diminishes in thickness from behind forwards, and extends nearly as far as the ciUary body, where it appears to terminate in a jagged margin, the ora serrata. Here the nervous tissues of the retina end, but a thin prolongation of the membrane extends forwards over the back of the ciliary processes and iris, forming the pars ciliaris reiince and pars iridica retinae already referred to. This forward prolongation consists of the pigment- ary layer of the retma together with a stratum of columnar epithehum. The retina is soft, semitransparent, and of a purple tint in the fresh state, o\\ang to the presence of a colouring material named rhodopsin or visual purple ; but it soon becomes clouded, opaque, and bleached when exposed to sunlight.

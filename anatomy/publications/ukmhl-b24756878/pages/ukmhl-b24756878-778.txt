760 ANGIOLOGY their plexiform arrangement in the scrotum, with their termination in one small vein in the abdomen ; their few and imperfect valves ; and the fact that they may be subjected to pressure in their passage through the abdominal wall. Varicocele almost mvanably occurs on the loft side, and this has been accomited for by the facts that the left spermatic vein joins the left renal at a right angle ; that it is overlaid by the iliac colon, and that when this portion of the gut is full of ftecal matter, in cases of constipation, its weight impedes the return of the venous blood ; and that the left spermatic veins are somewhat longer than the right. . The operation for the removal of a varicocele consists m making a small mcision ]U8t over the external abdommal ring and passing an aneurysm needle round the mass of veins, taking care that the vas deferens is not included. The veins are isolated from the vas and ligatured above and below, as high and as low as possible, and the intermediate portion . cut away; the divided ends are fixed together with a suture, and the skm wound closed. The ovarian veins (vv. ovaricae) correspond with the spermatic in the male • they form a plexus in the broad Ugament near the ovary and Fallopian tube, and communicate with the uterine plexus. They terminate in the same way as the spermatic veins in the male. Valves are occasionally found m these veins. Like the uterine veins, they become much enlarged during pre^ncy^^^ veins (vv. renales) are of large size, and placed in front of the renal arteries. The left is longer than the right, and passes m front of the aorta, just below the origin of the superior mesenteric artery it receives the left spermatic, the left inferior phrenic, and generally, the left suprarenal vems. It opens into the vena cava at a sUghtly higher level than the right. The suprarenal veins (vv. suprarenales) are two m number : the right terminates in the vena cava ; the left, in the left renal or phremc vem. The inferior phrenic veins (vv. phrenicse mferiores) follow the course of the phrenic arteries ; the right ends in the mferior vena cava, the left m tne left renal vein. • .i i, 4. „„„ +v>o The hepatic veins (vv. hepatic^) commence m tlie substance ot tne liver, in the capillary termmations of the portal vem and hepatic artery and consist of two groups, upper and lower.

758 ANGIOLOGY it courses backwards in the middle line between the dorsal arteries, underneath the deep fascia, and near the root of the penis passes between the two parts of the suspensory ligament and then through an aperture between the subpubic ligament and the triaifgular ligament of the urethra, and divides into two branches, which enter the prostatic plexus. The deep vein also conmiunicates below the symph3-sis pubis with the internal pudic vein. The uterine plexuses lie along the sides and superior angles of the uterus between the two layers of the broad ligament, and communicate with the ovarian and vaginal plexuses. They are drained by a pair of uterine veins on either side : these arise from the lower part of the plexuses, opposite the OS uteri externum, and open into the corresponding internal iliac vein. The vaginal plexuses are placed at the sides of the vagma; they communicate with the uterine, vesical, and hsemorrhoidal plexuses, and are drained by the vagmal veins, one on either side, into the internal }hac vems. The common iliac veins are formed by the union of the external and internal iliac veins in front of the sacro-iliac articulation ; passing obliquely upwards towards the right side, they terminate upon the fifth lumbar vertebra, bv uniting with each other at an acute angle to form the inferior vena cava. The right common iliac (v. iliaca communis dextra) is shorter than the lett, nearly vertical in its direction, and ascends behind and then to the outer side of its corresponding artery. The left common iliac (v. ihaca communis sinistra), longer than the right and more oblique in its course, is at first situated on the inner side of the correspondmg artery, and then behmd the right common iliac. Each common iliac receives the ilio-lumbar, and sometimes the lateral sacral veins. The left receives, m addition, the middle sacral vem. No valves are found in these veins. ■,• _^ i ^.-u^, f^„„f The middle sacral veins accompanv the correspondmg artery along the tront of the sacrum, and join to form a single vein (v. sacralis media), ^^<=J in the left common ihac vein ; sometimes m the angle of junction of the two Uiac veins. Peculiarities—The left common ihac vein, instead of ioining with the right in its usuflpoSr occasionally ascends on the left side of the aorta - .^^^f - ^^J^^f.^^^ where after receivmg the left renal vem, it crosses over the aorta, and then joins ;et to form the vena cava. In these cases, the two common ihacs are comaected by a smaU communicatmg branch at the spot where they are usuaUy umted.

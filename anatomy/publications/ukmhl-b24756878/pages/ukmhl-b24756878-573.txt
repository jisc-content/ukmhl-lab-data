555 x\lUSCLES AND FASCIA OF THE HAND From this origin the greater number of fibres pass obliquely downwards and converge to a tendon, which, uniting with the tendons of the deeper portion of the Flexor brevis poUicis and the Adductor transversus, is inserted into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, a sesamoid bone being developed in the tendon of insertion. A considerable fasciculus, however, Fig. 532.â€”Muscles of the left hand. Palmar sui'face. passes more obliquely outwards beneath the tendon of the long Flexor to join the superficial portion of the .short Flexor and the Abductor jjollicis. The Adductor transversus pollicis (fig. 531) is the most deeply seated of tiiis group of muscles. It is of a triangular form, arising by its broad base from the lower two-thirds of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger on its palmar surface ; the fibres, proceeding outwards, converge, to be inserted.

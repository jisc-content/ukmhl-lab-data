1056 ORGANS OP SPECIAL SENSE inclined towards eacli other, so that the rods meet at their opposite extremities, and form a series of arches roofing over a minute tunnel, the tunnel of Corli, between them and the basilar membrane ; this tunnel ascends spirally tlirough the whole length of the cochlea. The inner rods, some 6,000 in number, rest by means of expanded foot-plates on the basilar membrane, close to the labium tympanicum; they project obliquely upwards and outwards, and terminate above m expanded extremities, each of whicli resembles in shape the upper end of the ulna, with its sigmoid cavitv, coronoid and olecranon processes. On tlie outer side of the ro'd, ha the angle formed between it and tlie basilar membrane, is a nucleated mass of protoplasm; while on the inner side is a row of epitheUal cells {inner hair-cells), each surmounted by a brush of fine, stiff, hair-like processes. On the inner side of these cells are two or three rows of columnar supporting cells, which are continuous with the cubical cells lining the sulcus spiraUs mternus. The outer rods, numbermg about 4,000, also rest by broad foot-plates on the basilar membrane; they uicUne upwards and inwards, and the upper extremity of each resembles the head and bill of a s^van ; the back of the head Fig. 873.—Section tlirough the organ of Corti.

At the base of the rod, on its internal side —that is to say, in the angle formed by the rod ^^•ith the basilar membrane —is a similar protoplasmic mass to tliat found on the outer side of the base ot the inner rod; these masses of protoplasm are probably the undifferentia ed portions of th6 cells from which the rods are developed External to tlie outer rod are three or four successive rows of epithelial cells, more elonga ed than those found on the mternal side of the uiner rod, but, like them, furnis eel with mmute hairs or cilia. These are termed the outer hmr-cells, ""^ coim^- distinction to the inner hair-cells above referred to.

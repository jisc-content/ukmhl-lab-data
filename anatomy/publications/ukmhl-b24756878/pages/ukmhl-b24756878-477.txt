459 AURICULAR REGION rudimentary. Thej^ are the homologues of large and important muscles in some of tlie mammalia. . , u t The Attrahens auriculam (m. auriculans anterior), the smaUest ot tne tJn-ee is thin, fan-shaped, and its fibres are pale and indistinct. It arises from tlie lateral edge of the aponeurosis of the Occipito-f rontalis, and its fibres converge to be inserted into a projection on the front of the lielix. The Attollens auriculam (m. auricularis superior), the largest of the three, is thin and fan-shaped. Its fibres arise from the aponeurosis of the Occipito- frontalis, and converge to be inserted by a thin, flattened tendon into the upper part of the cranial surface of the pinna. Tlie Retrahens auriculam (m. auricularis posterior) consists of two or three fleshv fasciculi, which arise from the mastoid portion of the temporal bone by short aponeurotic fibres. They are inserted into the lower part of the cranial surface of the concha. Nerves.—The Attrahens and Attollens auriculam are supplied by the temporal branch of the facial nerve ; the Retrahens auriculam is supplied by the posterior auricular branch of the same nerve. Actions.—In man, these muscles possess very little action : the Attrahens auriculam draws the ear forwards and upwards ; the Attollens auriculam shghtly raises it; and the Retrahens auriculam draws it backwards. III. Palpebeal Region (figs. 481 and 482) Orbicularis palpebrarum. Tensor tarsi. Corrugator supercUii. Tlie Orbicularis palpebrarum (m. orbicularis oculi) is a sphincter muscle which surrounds the circumference of the orbit and eyelids. It arises from Fig. 482.—Left Orbicularis palpebrarum, seen from behind. (From Toldfc's Atlas, published by Rebman, Ltd., London.)

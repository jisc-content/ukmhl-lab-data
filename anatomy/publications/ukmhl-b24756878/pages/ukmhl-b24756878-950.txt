The petrous ganglion (ganglion petrosum) is situated in a depression in the lower border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone ; it is larger than the superior, and mvolves the whole of the fibres of the nerve From this eanghon arise those filaments which connect the glosso-pharyngeal mth the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves. Branches of communication. — Ihe giosso- pharyngeal nerve commumcates with tne pneumogastric, sympathetic, and facial. The branches to the pneumogastric are two filaments which arise from the petrous ganglion one passing to the auricular branch, and the othertotheupperganglion,ofthepneumogastric The petrous ganglion is connected by a^^ment with the superior cervical ^-Kn^^h T^^r^^ facial P~ ^^^^^^^ the stylo-mastoid foramen. ^ranches of distribution of the glosso- phaf;^gfj\rt rir^-^"^^^^^^ —' —' ^"^^he tympanic branch (J-^--"^^" S^^^^ petrous gLgUon, and ^f^^^^f^rtL W * ThiSi separates the carotid portion of the temporal bone J^^JJ^;' tie tympanum, which it enters Lnal from the Pgu^ar fossa ^J^^^^^' ^se to the waU, and divides by an aperture tii^flo"^^ ^T.^tV^/J-nan^^^ into branches.

For the sake of illustration a species may be taken in which the number of nuclear chro- mosomes is four (fig. 96). If an ovum from such be observed at the begin- ning of the maturation process it -will be seen that the number of its chromo- somes is apparently re- duced to two. In reality, however, the number is doubled, since each chro- mosome consists of four granules grouped to form a tetrad. During the raetaphase (see page 5) each tetrad di^^des into two dyads, wliich are equally distributed be- tween the nuclei of the two cells formed by the first division of the ovum. One of the two cells is almost as large as the original ovum, and is named the secondanj oocyte; the other is small, and is

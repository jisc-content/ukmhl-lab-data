90G NEUROLOGY Emereing from the valve of Vieussens, the nerve is directed outwards across the superioi-peduncle of the cerebellum, and then winds forwards round the outer side of the crus cerebri, immediately above tlie pons Varohi, pierces the dura mater in the free border of the tentorium cerebelli, just behmd, and external to the posterior clinoid process, and passes forwards in the outer waU of the cavernous sinus, between the third nerve and the ophthalmic division of the S It crossed tlie third nerve, and enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure It now becomes the higliest of all the nerves, and lies at the inner eXmity of the fissure internal to the frontal nerve. In the orbit it passeB Swids, above the origin of the Levator palpebral, and finaUy enters the orbital surface of the Superior obhque. BVanches of communication.-In the outer M^all of ^Je cavernous sinus the fourth nerve forms communications with the oplithalmic division of the fifth and Si the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic. In the sphenoidal fissure it occa- Sonally Xes oft a^branch to the lachrymal nerve. Branches of d^sMo,u- it ltvl off a recurrent branch, which passes backwards between the layers of JheTentoi^ni dividing into two or three filaments which may be traced as far back as the wall of the lateral smus.

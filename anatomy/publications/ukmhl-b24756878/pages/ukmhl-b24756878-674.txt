To its inner side are the cesophagus, trachea, thoracic duct, and left recurrent laryngeal Second and Third Parts of the Subclavian Artery (fig. 590) The second portion of the subclavian artery lies behind the Scalenus anticus muscle ; it is very short, and forms the highest part of the arch described by the vessel. ^ • w • -ni ^ i Relations.—It is covered, in front, by the skm, superficial fascia, i'laty.sma, deep cervical fascia, Sterno-mastoid, and Scalenus anticus. On the right side of tie body the phrenic nerve is separated from the second part of the artery by the Scalenus anticus while on the left side it crosses the first part of the artery unmediately to the inner edge of the muscle. Behind, it is in relation with the pleura and the Scalenus medius. Above it, is the brachial plexus of nerves ; below, the pleuxa ihe subclavian vein lies below and in front of the artery, separated from it by the Scalenus anticus. j ^ i. a The third portion of the subclavian artery runs do^TOwards and out\\ arclf- from the outer margin of the Scalenus anticus to the outer border of the first rib, where it becomes the axillary artery. This is the most superficial portion of the vessel, and is contained in the subclavian triangle (see ^^^Ke1ttions.-It is covered in front, by the skin, the superficial fascia, the Platvsma the descendmg clavicular branches of the cervical plexus, and the deep cervical fascia. The external jugular vem crosses its mner part and receives the suprascapular, transversahs colh and anterior jugular vems, which frequenth orm a pFexus in front of the artery. Behind the vems, the nerve to the Subclavius muscle descends m front of the artery. The outer part of the artery les behmd Se clavicle and the Subclavius muscle and is crossed by the suprascapular vessels. The ubclavian vem lies m front of and at a slightly lower level than the artery. BeM it hes on the lowest trmik of the brachial plexus, which mtervenes between 1^ and the Scalenus medius. . Above and to its outer side, are the upper trmiks of tlrbrachial plexus, and the Omo-hyoid muscle.

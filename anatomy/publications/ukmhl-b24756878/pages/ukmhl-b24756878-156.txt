138 EMBRYOLOGY The sinus venosus is at first situated in the septum transversum (a layer of mesoderm in which the liver and the central tendon of the Diaphragm are developed) behind the common auricle, and is formed by the union of the viteUine veins. The veins or ducts of Cuvier from the body of the embryo and the umbilical veins from the placenta subsequently open into it (fig. 185). The sinus is at first placed transversely, and opens by a median aperture into the common auricle. Soon, however, it assumes an oblique position, and becomes crescentic in Fig. 183.—Heart of human embryo of about fifteen days. (Reconstruction by His.) Maxillary process Stoviatodtxum Mandibular arch Aortic bulb- Ventricle Duct of Cuvier Umbilical vein form ; its right half or horn increases more rapidly than the_ left, while the opening into the auricle now communicates with the right portion of the aun- cular cavity. The right horn ultimately becomes incorporated with and tomis a part of the right auricle, the Une of union between it and the auncle proper being indicated in the interior of the adult auncle by a vertical crest, the crista terminaUs of His. The left horn, which ultimately receives only the left duct of Cuvier, persists as the coronary sinus (fig- 192). The ^ateUlne and umbiUcal veins are soon replaced by a single vessel, the mfenor vena cava, ana Fig. 184.—Heart showing expansion of auricles. (Drawn from Ecker-Zeigler model.)

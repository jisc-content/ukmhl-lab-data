SPLANCHNOLOGY 1076 the pericardium, which it covers to a sliglit extent; it then covers tlie back part of the root of the king, from the lower border of which a triangular slieet descends vertically by tlie side of the posterior mediastinum to the Diaphragm. This sheet is the posterior layer of a wide fold, l<nown as the broad ligament of the lung {ligamenlum fulmonah or ligamentum latum pulmonis). From tiie posterior aspect of the lung root, the pleura may be traced over the convex surface of tlie lung, the summit and base, and also over the sides of the fissures between the lobes, on to its inner surface and the front part of its root ; it is continued from the lower margin of the root as the anterior layer of the broad ligament, and from this it is Fig. 890.—^Lateral view of chest, showing relations of right pleura and lung to the chest-wail. The blue line indicates the line of pleural reflection; the red lines, the outline of the lung and its fissures. Subclavian artery reflected on to the pericardium, and from it to the back of tlie sternum. Below, it covers the upper surface of the Diaphragm, and extends, in front, as low as the costal cartilage of the seventh rib ; at the side of the chest, to the lower border of the tenth rib on the left side and to the upper border of the same rib on the right side ; and behind, it reaches as lo^^• as the twelfth rib, and sometimes even as low as the transverse process of the fu-st lumbar ver- tebra. Above, its apex ijrojects. through the superior opening of the thorax into the neck, ex- tending from one to two inches above the anterior extremity of the first rib ; this portion of the sac is strengthened by a dome- like expansion of fascia {Sib- so7i's fascia), attached in front to the inner border of the first rib, and behind to the anterior border of the transverse process of the seventh cer\'ical vertebra. TMs is covered and strength- ened by a few spreading mus- cular fibres derived from the Scaleni. In the fi-ont of the chest, where the parietal layer of the pleura is reflected backwards to the pericardium, the two pleural sacs are in contact for a short distance. At the upper part of the chest, behind the manu- brium, thev are not in contact: the point of reflection being re- presented bv a line drawn from the sterno-clavicular articula- tion to the mid-point of the , .rd^s d i^e^^^ of the sternum.

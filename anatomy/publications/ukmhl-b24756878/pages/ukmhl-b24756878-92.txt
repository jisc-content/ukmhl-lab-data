74 HISTOLOGY They are described as lining the two tracts—the gastro-pulmonary and the genito-uvinary ; and alh or almost all, mucous membranes may be classed as belonging to and continuous with the one or the other of these tracts. The deep surfaces of these membranes are attached to the parts which they line by means of connective tissue, which is sometimes very abundant, fommg a loose and lax bed, so as to allow considerable movement of the opposed sudaces on each other. This is termed the submucous tissue. In other cases such an intervening tissue is exceedingly scanty, and the membrane is closely connected to the tissue beneath ; sometimes, for example, to muscle, as m the tongue ; sometimes to cartilage, as in the larynx ; and sometimes to bone, as m the nasal fossse and air sinuses of the skull. „i In structure a mucous membrane is composed of conum and epithelium, ine epithelium is of various forms, including the squamous, columnar, and ciliated, and is often arranged in several lavers. This epithelial layer is supported by the corium, which is analogous to the dermis of the skin, and consists of connective tissue, either simply areolar, or containing a greater or lesser quantity otlj-mpiioia tissue. The coriimi is usually covered on its external suiiace by a transparent basement membrane, generally composed of clear flattened cells placed edge to edge ; on this the epithelium rests. It is only in some situations that the basement membrane can be demonstrated. The corium is an exceedingly vascular membiane containing a dense network of capillaries, which he immediately beneath tue epithelium and are derived from small arteries in the submucous tissue. ^ The fibro-vascular layer of the corium contains, besides the areolai tissue and vessels, unstriped muscle-cells, which form in many situations a detiuite layer called the muscularis mucosoB. These are situated m the deepest pait ot the membrane, and are plentifully supplied with nerves. Other ^JJ^^ P^/^^ the epithehmn and terminate between the cells.

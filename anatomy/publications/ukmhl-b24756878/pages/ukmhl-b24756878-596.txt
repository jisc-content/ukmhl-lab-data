MYOLOGY 578 Vastus exteriius, extending up almost as high as the insertion of the Gluteus raaximus ; from the outer prolongation of the linea aspera to within two inches of the outer condyle ; and from the external intermuscular septum. The fibres of the long head form a fusiform heWy, which passes obliquely down- wards and outwards across the great sciatic nerve to terminate in an apo- neurosis which covers the posterior surface of the muscle, and receives the fibres of the short head : this aponeurosis becomes gradually contracted into a tendon, Avhich is inserted into the outer side of the head of the fibula, and by a small slip into the lateral surface of the external tuberosity of the tibia. At its insertion the tendon divides into two portions, which embrace the long external lateral ligament of the knee-joint. From the posterior border of the tendon a thin expansion is given off to the fascia of the leg. The tendon of this muscle forms the outer hamstring ; the external popliteal nerve descends aloiig its inner border. The Semitendinosus, remarkable for the great length of its tendon, is situated at the posterior and inner aspect of the thigh. It arises from the lower and inner impression on the tuberosity of the ischium, by a tendon common to it and the long head of the Biceps ; it also arises from an apo- neurosis which connects the adjacent surfaces of the two muscles to the extent of about three inches from their origin. It forms a fusiform muscle, which, passing downwards and inwards, terminates a little below the middle of the thigh in a long round tendon which lies along the irmer side of tlie popliteal space ; it then curves around the inner tuberosity of the tibia and passes over the mternal lateral ligament of the knee-jouit, from which it is separated bv a bursa, and is inserted into the upper part of the inner surface of tlie shaft of the tibia, nearly as far forwards as its anterior border. At its insertion it wives off from its lower border a prolongation to the deep fascia of the leg. This tendon hes behind the tendon of the Sartorius, and below that^of the Gracilis, to w^hich it is united. A tendinous mtersection is usuaUy observed about the middle of the muscle. r ■ • The Semimembranosus, so called from its membranous tendon ot origin, is situated at the back part and inner side of the thigh. It arises by a thick tendon from the upper and outer impression on the back part of the tuberosity of the ischium, above and to the outer side of the Biceps and Semitendinosus, and is inserted into the groove on the inner and back part of the inner tuberosity of the tibia. The tendon of the muscle at its origin expands into an apo- neurosis, which covers the upper part of its anterior surface : from this aponeurosis muscular fibres arise, and converge to another aponeurosis which covers the lower part of its posterior surface and contracts into the tendon of insertion. The tendon of insertion gives off certain fibrous expansions : one of these, of considerable size, passes upwards and outwards to be inserted into the back part of the outer condyle of the femur, forming P^^^ «f the postemr ligament of the knee-joint; a second is contmued downWs J<> "^f ™ which covers the Popliteus muscle ; while a few fibres join the mternal lateral Hgament of the joint and the fascia of tlie leg. The muscle overlaps the unper part of the popliteal vessels. 4. • , ^ The tendons of the two preceding muscles form t^ie mnf l^ams ring.

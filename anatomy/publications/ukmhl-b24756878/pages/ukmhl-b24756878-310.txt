OSTEOLOGY 292 superior lip, and a rough tubercle is generally seen on that portion of the spine which receives the tendon of insertion of the lower part of this muscle. The Deltoid is attached to the whole length of tlie interior lip. The interval between the lips is subcutaneous and partly covered by the tendinous fibres of these muscles. The external border, or base, the shortest of the three, is slightly concave ; its edge, thick and round, is contiimous above with the under surface of the acromion process, below with tlie neck of the scapula. It forms tlie inner boundary of a notch, the (p-eat scajmlar notch, wliich serves to connect the supra- and infra-spinous fossae. The acromion process (acromion) forms the summit of the shoulder, and is a large, somewhat triangular or oblong process, flattened from beliind forwards, directed at first a httle outwards, and then curving forwards and upwards, so as to overhang the glenoid cavity. Its upper surface, directed upwards, backwards, and outwards, is convex, rough, and gives attachment to some fibres of the Deltoid, and in tlie rest of its extent is subcutaneous. Its under surface is smooth and concave. Its outer border is thick and irregular, and presents three or four tubercles for the tendinous origins of the Deltoid muscle. Its hmer border, shQi'ter than the outer, is concave, gives attachment to a portion of the Trapezius, and presents about its centre a small, oval surface (facies articularis acromii) for articulation with the acromial end of the clavicle. Its apex, which corresponds to the point of meeting of these two borders in front, is thin, and has attached to it the coraco-acromial ligament. Of the three borders of the scapula, the superior (margo superior) is the shortest and thinnest ; it is concave, and extends from the superior angle to the base of the coracoid process. At its outer part is a deep, semicircular notch, the suprascapular notch (incisura scapulae), formed partly by the base of the coracoid process. This notch is converted into a foramen by the transverse ligament, and serves for the passage of the suprascapular nerve ; sometimes the ligament is ossified. The adjacent margin of the superior border affords attachment to the Omo-liyoid. The external or axillary border (margo axdlaris) is the thickest of the three. It begins above at the lower margm of the glenoid cavity, and inclines obliquely downwards and backwards to the inferior angle. Immediately below the glenoid cavity is a rough impression, the infraglenoid tubercle (tuberositas infraglenoidahs) about an inch in length, which affords attacliment to the long head of the Triceps ; in front of this is a lont^itudinal groove, which extends as far as the lower third of this border, and affords origin to part of the Subscapularis. The inferior tlurd, which is thin and sharp, serves for the attachment of a few fibres of the Teres major behind, and of the Subscapularis in front. The internal or vertebral border (margo vertebralis), also named the base, is the longest of the three, and extends from the superior to the inferior angle. It is arched, intermediate m thickness between the superior and tlie external borders, and the portion of it above t he spine is bent considerably outwards, so as to form an obtu.se angle with tlie part below. This border presents an anterior and a posterior hp, and an intermediate narrow area. The anterior lip affords attachment to the Serratus masnus : the posterior lip, to the Supraspinatus above the spine, the intra- spinatus below ; tlie area between the two lips, to the Levator anguli scapu * above the triangular surface at the commencement of the spine, to the Rhomboideus minor on the edge of that surface, and to the Rhoniboideus major ■ this last is attached by means of a fibrous arch, connected above to the lower part of the triangular surface at the base of the spine, and below to the lower part of the border. j , • f;„„ Of the three ajwles. the superior (angulus medialis), formed by the junction of the superior and internal borders, is thin, smooth, rounded, mclined somc- whaf outwards, and gives attacliment to a few fibres of I^vato;anguh scapulae.

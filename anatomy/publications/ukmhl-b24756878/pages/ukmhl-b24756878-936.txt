918 NEUROLOGY Branches of communication.—It is connected by two or three short delicate filaments with the internal pterygoid branch of the uifenor maxiUary nerve, from which it may obtain a motor, and possibly also a sensory root, it communicates with the glosso-pharyngeal and facial nerves, through the smaU superficial petrosal nerve continued from the tympanic plexus, and through this cXmunication it probably receives a sensory root from the glosso-pharyngeal and a motor root from the facial; its communication with the sympathetic fs eft^cted by a filament from the plexus surrounding the middle meningeal artery The ganglion also communicates with the auriculo-temporal nerve by a bxS which^is I'robably derived from the glosso-phaiyngeal, and which passes to the JansUon and then through it and the auriculo-temporal nerve to the parotid gknd ' I slender fflament [sphenoidal) ascends from it to tlic Vidian Serve and a small branch communicates with the chorda tympani.

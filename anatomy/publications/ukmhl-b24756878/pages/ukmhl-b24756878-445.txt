HIP-JOINT 427 upward inclination of the neck, is not a simple rotation of the head of the femur in the acetabulum, but is accompanied by a certain amount of gliding. The hip-joint presents a very striking contrast to the shoulder-joint in the much more complete mechanical arrangements for its security and for the limita- tion of its movements. In the shoulder, as has been seen, the head of the humerus is not adapted at all in size to the glenoid cavity, and is hardly restrained in any of its ordinary movements by the capsular Ugament. In the hip-joint, on the contrary, the head of the femur is closely fitted to the acetabulum for a distance extending over nearly half a sphere, and at the margin of the bony cup it is still more closely embraced by the cotyloid ligament, so that the head of the femur is held in its place by that ligament even when the fibres of the capsule have been quite divided (Humphry). The ilio-femoral Ugament is the strongest of all the ligaments in the body, and is put on the stretch by any attempt to extend the femur beyond a straight hue with the trunk. That is to say, this ligament is the chief agent in maintaining the erect position without muscular fatigue ; for a Fig. 465.—ReLation of muscles to the capsule of the hip-joint.

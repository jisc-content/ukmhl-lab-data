876 NEUROLOGY Foramen of Monro.—Between the anterior pillats of the fornix and tlie anterior extremities of the thalami, an oval aperture is seen on either side: tliis is the foramen of Monro and tlirough it tlie lateral ventricle communicates with the third ventricle. Behind the epithelial lining of the foramen the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles are joined across the iniddle line. The anterior commissure (commissura anterior) is a bundle ot white fibres w^iich connects the two cerebral hemispheres across the middle line, and is placed in front of the anterior pillars of the fornix. On sagittal section it is seen to be oval in shape, its long diameter being vertical m direction and measuring about one-fifth of an inch. Its fibres can be traced outwards and backwards on each side beneath the corpus striatum into the substance of the temporal lobe. It serves in this way to connect the two temporal lobes, Fig. 745.—The fornix, velum interpositum, and middle or descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. partition. ?t consi^sts of two cl^^«t -t lamni^, SK^^/ ^^.^ T ie oSer surface by a narrow chink or interval, t'^e «o-cf 1 j|-J^'^' aiSr cornu of the latcra^ of each lamina is directed towards tlie body ^^'l^ ,,.,,iie its mesial :lntricle, and is covered ^n^, l^^X voSlo I't a'lS.'sernVtranspareU^

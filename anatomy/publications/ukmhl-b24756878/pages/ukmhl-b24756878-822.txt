804 NEUROLOGY the poslerior basal column in the base of the posterior horn and on tlie outer side of Clarke's column. The posterior basal column is well marked in the gorilla (Waldeyer), but is ill-defined in man. The axons of these cells pass partly to the posterior and lateral columns of the same side, and partly through the anterior commissure to the lateral column of the opposite side. Before leaving the grey matter, a considerable number run longitudmally for a varying distance in the head of the posterior horn, formnig what is termed the longitudinal fasciculus of the posterior liorn. , . ^, A few star-shaped or fusiform nerve-cells of varymg size are found m tlie substantia gelatinosa centralis. Their axons pass mto the lateral column of the same, or of the opposite side. ^ . ■ i. The nerve-fibres in the grey matter form a dense mteiiacement ot mmute fibrils amona the nerve-cells. This interlacement is formed partly of axons which pass from the cells in the grey matter to enter the white columns or nerve-roots ; partly of the axons of Golgi's ceUs which ramify only in the grey substance ; and partly of collaterals from the nerve-fibres m the white columns, w^hich, as alreadv stated, enter the grey matter and ramify withm it. White matter —The white matter of the spinal cord consists of meduUatert nerve-fibres imbedded in a sponge-like network of neuroglia, and is arranged in three columns : anterior, lateral, and posterior. The anterior column lies between the anterior median fissure and the outermost of the anterior nerve- roots ■ the lateral column between the outermost of the anterior nerve-roots and the postero-lateral sulcus; and the posterior <;«1^^, between tlie postero-lateral sulcus and the posterior median fissure (fig. 681). -L^e bf ies ?ary gi-eatly in thickness, the smallest being fmmd m the fasciculus gracihs the trac^tS Lissauer, and inner part of the lateral column ; wMe the largest situated in the anterior column, and m the peripheral part of the lateral column.

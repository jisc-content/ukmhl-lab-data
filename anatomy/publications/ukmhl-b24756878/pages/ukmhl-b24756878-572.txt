564 MYOLOGY 11. Baclinl Beqion (figs. 531, 532) Abductor pollicis. Flexor brevis poUicis. Opponens pollicis. Adductor obliquus pollicis. Adductor transversus pollicis. The Abductor pollicis (m. abductor pollicis brevis) is a thin, flat muscle, placed immediately beneath the integument. It arises from the annular ligament, the tuberosity of the scaphoid, and the ridge of the trapezium, frequently by two distinct slips. Running outwards and downwards, it is inserted by a thin, flat tendon into the radial side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb and the capsule of the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation. The Opponens pollicis is a small, triangular muscle, placed beneath tlie preceding. It arises from the palmar surface of the ridge on the trapezium and from the annular ligament, passes do^A^^wards and outwards, and is inserted into the whole length of the metacarpal bone of the thumb on its radial side. The Flexor brevis pollicis consists of two portions, outer and nmer. The outer and more superjicial 'portion arises from the outer two-thirds of the lower border of the annular ligament and the lower part of the ridge on the trapezium : it passes along the outer side of the tendon of the Flexor longus poUicis, and, becoming tendinous, has a sesamoid bone developed in its tendon, and is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the thum b. The inner and deeper portion of the muscle is very small, and arises from the ulnar side of the first metacarpal bone between the Adductor obliquus poUiei> and the outer head of the First dorsal interos.seous, and is inserted mto the inner side of the base of the first phalanx with the Adductor obliquii> ^'"^'Tho Adductor obliquus pollicis arises by several slips from the (- magnum, the bases ot tlie second and third metacarpal bones, the an erioi carpal ligaments, and the sheath of the tendon of the Flexor carpi racUahs.

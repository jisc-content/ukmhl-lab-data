SPLANCHNOLOGY 1092 by the dorsum of the tongue ; and on either side, by the anterior pillar of the fauces. The aponeurosis of the soft 'palate is a thin but firm fibrous layer attaclied . above to the posterior border of the hard palate, and becoming thinner towards the free margin of the soft palate. Laterally, it is continuous ^\dth the pharyngeal aponeurosis. It forms the framcM'ork of the soft palate, and is joined by the tendons of the Tensor palati muscles. The muscles of the soft palate are five on each side : the Levator palati. Tensor palati, Azygos uvulae, Palato-glossus, and Palato-pharyngeus (see pages 484, 485). The following is the relative position of the structures in a dis'section' of the soft palate from the posterior or pharyngeal to the anterior or oral surface. Immediately beneath the mucous membrane is a thin stratum of muscular fibres, the posterior fasciculus of the Palato-pharyngeus muscle, joining mth its fellow of the opposite side in the middle line. Beneath tins is the Azygos uvulae, consisting of two rounded fleshy fasciculi which are in contact with each other in the median line of the soft palate. Next comes the aponeurosis of the Levator palati joining with that of the muscle of the opposite side in the middle line. Pourtlily, is the anterior fasciculus of the Palato-pharyngeus, tMcker than the posterior, and separating the Levator palati from the next muscle, the Tensor palati. This muscle terminates m a tendon wliich, after winding round the hamular process, expands into a broad aponeurosis in the soft palate, anterior to the other muscles wliich have been enumerated. Finally there is a thin muscular stratum, the Palato-glossus muscle, placed in front of the aponeurosis of the Tensor palati, and separated from the oral mucous membrane by glands and adenoid tissue. The mucous membrane of the soft palate is thin, and covered with squamous epithelium on both surfaces, excepting near the orifice of the Eustachian tube, where it is columnar and ciUated.* Beneath the mucous membrane on the oral surface of the soft palate is a considerable amount of adenoid tissue. The palatine glands form a continuous layer on its posterior surface and round the uvula. Vessels and Nerves.-The arteries supplying the palate are the descending palatine branch of the internal maxillary, the ascending palatine branch of the facial, and tlie palatine branch of the ascending pharyngeal. The veins terminate chiefly m the pterygoid and tonsillar plexuses. The lymphatic vessels pass to the deep cervical glands, ibe motor nerves are chiefly derived from the pharyngeal plexus, the Tensor palati, hmvever receiving a special branch from the otic gangUon. Tlie sensory filaments are derived from the descendmg palatine and naso-palatine nerves and from the glo^so-P^^^^y"^,^*^^^^ Applied Anatomij.-The occurrence of a congenital cleft m the palat^e has been alread> referred to as a defect in development {page 285).

It gives rise to a change in the vSwhich becomes nasal, and to the regurgitation of fluids down the nose .^en hei swallowii^g is attempted. On inspection, the palate is seen to hang flaccid and motionless when phonation or deglutition are attempted ; it is also anaesthetic.

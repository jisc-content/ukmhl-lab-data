861 THE TEMPORAL LOBE lingiialis) lies between the calcariiie fissure and the posterior part of the collateral fissure, and extends, therefore, on to the tentorial surface. Behind, it reaches the occipital pole ; in front, it is continued on to the tentorial surface of the temporal lobe, and joins the hippocainpal convolution. Tlie tentorial surface of the occipital lobe is limited in front by an imaginary Ime carried in-wards from the pre-occipital notch, and consists of the posterior part of the occipito-iemporal convolution and the lower part of the lingual lobule, \\ hich are separated from each other by the posterior segment of the collateral Jis.mre. Temporal lobe.—The temporal lobe (lobus temporalis) presents upper lower, and tentorial sui-faces. ^ ' The upper surface form the lower limit of the fissure of Sylvius, and overlaps the island of Rail. On opening out the fissure of Sylvius, three or four gvri wiU be seen sprmgmg from the depth of the hinder end of the fissure, and ruimmg obhquely forwards and out\A'ards on the posterior part of the upper surface of the first temporal convolution ; these are named the avri temporales iransverst or gyri of Heschl (fig. 730).

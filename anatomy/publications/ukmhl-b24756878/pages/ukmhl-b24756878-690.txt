ANGIOLOGY 672 the two muscles overlapping the artery to a considerable extent. By its inner side, its upper half is in relation with the internal cutaneous and ulnar nerves, its lower half with the median nerve. The basilic vein lies on its inner side, but is separated from it in the lower part of the arm by the deep fascia. Tlie artery is accompanied by two venfB comites, which lie in close contact with it, being connected together at intervals by short transverse communicating branches. Anatomy of the Bend of the Elbow (anticubital fossa) At the bend of the elbow the brachial artery sinks deeply into a triangular interval. The base of the triangle is directed upwards, and is represented by a line connecting the two condyles of the humerus ; the sides are bounded, externally, by the inner edge of the Brachio-radialis, internally, by the outer margin of the Pronator teres ; the floor is formed by the Brachialis anticus and Supmator brevis. This space contains the brachial artery, with its accom- panying' veins; the radial and ulnar arteries: the median and musculo-spiral nerves and the tendon of the Biceps. The brachial artery opcupies the middle line of the space, and divides opposite the neck of the radius mto the radial and ubiar arteries ; it is covered, in front, by the integument the superficial fascia, and the vena mediana cubiti, the vem bemg separated from direct contact with the artery by the bicipital fascia. Behind, it hes on the Brachialis anticus, which separates it from the elbow-jomt. The median nerve lies on the inner side of the artery, close to it above, but separated from it below by the coronoid origin of the Pronator teres. The tendon of the Biceps lies to the outer side of the artery, and stiU more externaUy is the musculo-spiral nerve which is situated upon the Supmator brevis, and concealed by the Brachio-radialis. Peculiarities of the hracUal artery as regards its Cowrsfi.—The brachial artery, accom- panied bv the median nerve, may leave the inner border of the Biceps, and descend towards the inner epicondyle of the humerus ; about two mches above the epicondyle it usuaUy in such cases curves round a prominence of bone, the sufracoiidylar process, from which a fibrous arch is in most cases thrown over the artery ; it then inchnes outwards, beneath or through the substance of the Pronator teres, to the bend of the elbo^-. This variation bears considerable analogy with the normal condition of the artery m some of the caraivora : it has been referred to m the description of the humerus (page 298) As renards Us division.-Oco^sMly, the artery is divided for a short distance at it. upper part into two trunks, which are united below.

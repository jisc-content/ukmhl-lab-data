LYMPHATICS OF THE HEAD, PACE, AND NECK 771 The submaxillary glands (lymphoglandulfe submaxillares) (fig. 652), three to six in number, are placed beneath the body of the mandible in the submaxillary triangle, and rest on the superficial surface of the submaxillary salivary gland. One gland (the middle gland of Stahr), which lies on the facial artery as it turns over the mandible, is tlae most constant of the series. Small lymphatic glands are sometimes found on the deep surface of the submaxillary gland. Their afferents drain the imier canthus of the eye, the cheek, the side of the nose, the upper lip, the outer part of the lower lip, the gums, and the anterior part of the margin of the tongue; efferent vessels from the facial and suprahyoid glands also enter the submaxillary glands. Their efferent vessels pass to the upper glands of the deep cervical group. Fig. 663.—Lymphatics of the tongue. (Poirier.) Vessels from Vessels f rom base of tongue margin of The suprahyoid or submental glands are situated close to the middle line ot the neck between the anterior bellies of the two Digastric muscles. Their atterents dram the central portions of the lower Up and floor of the mouth and ine tip of the tongue ; their efferents pass partly to the submaxillary glands and partly to a gland of the deep cervical group situated on the internal jugular vein at the level of the cricoid cartilage. in 1 external jugular glands (lymphoglandulse cervicales superficiales) lie n Close relationship with the external jugular vein as it emerges from the parotid gland, and, therefore, superficial to the Sterno-mastoid.

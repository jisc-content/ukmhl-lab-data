254 OSTEOLOGY curves downwards and outwards, hooking over the lower edge of the orifice of the antrum which it narrows below; this lamina fixes the bone firmly to the outer wall of the nasal fossa and is caUed the maxillary process (processus maxiUaris). The injenor border is free, thick, and cellular in structire more especially in the middle of the bone. Both extremities are more or less narrow and pointed, the posterior being the more tapering. Pia. 325.—Right inferior turbinated bone. Internal surface. Fig. 326.—Right inferior turbinated bone. External surface. Ossification.-The inferior turbinated bone is ossified from a single centre, which appears about the fifth month of foetal Ufe in the outer wall of the cartilaginous nasal capsule. Articulations.—The inferior turbinated articulates with four bones: the ethmoid, maxilla, lachrymal, and palate. The Vomer The Vomer (vomer) is situated in the mesial plane, and forms the hmder and lower part of the septum of the nose (fig. 327). It is thin, somewhat quadrilateral m shape, and its anterior portion is frequently bent to one or Fig. 327.—Vomer in situ. Frontal sinus Sphenoidal sinus For triangular cartilage Eostrum of sjyht iwid Internal pterygoid plate other side ; it has two surfaces and four borders. The surfaces (fig. 328) arc marked by small furrows for blood-vessels, and each presents a groove, the naso- palatine, which runs obliquely downwards and forwards, and transmits the naso-palatine nerve and vessels. Tlie superior border, the thickest, jiresents a deep furrow, bounded on either side by a horizontal projecting ala of bone ;

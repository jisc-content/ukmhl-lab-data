EMBRYOLOGY 142 aortffi are drawn out, and the third and fourth arches arise directly fi-oni these vessels. In fishes these arches persist and give off branches to the gills, in which the blood is oxygenated. In mammals some of them remain as permanent structures, while others disappear or become obUterated (fig. 191). The anterior ventral aortce.—These persist on both sides. The right forms (a) the innominate artery, (6) the right common and external carotid arteries. The left gives rise to (a) the short portion of the aortic arch, which reaches from the origin of the innominate artery to that of the left common carotid artery ; (b) the left common and external carotid trunks. The aortic arches.—The first and second disappear ; the third constitutes the commencement of the internal carotid artery, and is therefore named the carotid j<];q 190 ^Profile view of a human embryo estimated at twenty or twenty-one days old.

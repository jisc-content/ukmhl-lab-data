SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY 655 nerve and the cardiac branches of the pneumogastric and sympathetic. A loop of the sympathetic trunk also crosses the artery, forming a ring {annulus Vieussenii) around the vessel. The anterior jugular vein passes outwards in front of the artery, but is separated from it by the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles. Kg. 590.â€”Superficial dissection of the right side of the neck, showing the carotid and subclavian arteries. Below and behind the artery is the pleura, which separates it fi'oni the apex of the lung; behind is the gangliated cord of the sympathetic, the Longus colU muscle and the first thoracic vertebra. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve winds round the lower and back part of the vessel. First Part of the Left Subclavian Artery (fig. 572) The first part of the left subclavian artery arises from the arch of the aorta, behind the left common carotid, and at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra ; it ascends nearly vertically to the root of the neck and then arches outwards to the inner margin of the Scalenus anticus.

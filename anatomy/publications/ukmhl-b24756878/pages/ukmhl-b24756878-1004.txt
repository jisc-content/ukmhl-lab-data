98G NEUROLOGY communicate with the/inferior pudendal yid superficial perineal nerves at the fore part of the perinajUm. , , , , • , r, i f The perineal nerve, the inferior and larger of the two termmal branches ot the pudic is situated below the pudic artery. It accompanies tlie superfacial permeal artery m the perinajum and divides into cutaneous and umscuiar The cutaneous branches (superficial perineal) are two m number posterior and anterior. The posterior or external branch pierces the base of the tria«gular ligament of the urethra, and passes forwards along the outer side of the uretliral triangle in company with the superficial permeal artery ; it is distributed to he skin of the scrotum. It communicates with the mferior hieinorrhoidal, the inferior pudendal, and the other superficial perineal nerve. The internal branch also pierces the base of the triangular hgament and pas^^^^ forwards nearer to the middle fine, to be distributed to the inner and back part of the scrotum. Both these nerves supply the labium majus in the temaie. The muscular branches are distributed to the Transversus p™i Accelerator urmaj, Erector penis, and Compressor urethral. A distmct branch give' off from the nerve to the Accelerator urina., pierces this muscle Ind supplies the corpus spongiosum, ending in the mucous membrane of the urethra. This is the nerve to the bulb. . u The dorsal nerve of the penis is the deepest division of the pudic nerve .^t accompanies the pudic artery along the ramus of the ischmm ; then runs forwards along the inner margin of the ramus of ^^^t^^^^^the S^^^^^^ superficial and deep layers of the triangular hgament. ^<;^g f Z^!^^^^^^^ Uver it sives a branch to the corpus cavernosum, and passes tonvaias, m XanyS the dorsal artery of thJpenis between J^^.^ J-^Sf^^S ligament, on to the dorsum of the perns, along which it is cairied as tax as tue ^^"TnTh^Sle tWorsal nerve is very small, and supphes the chtoris.

153 DEVELOPMENT OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL pentagonal orifice. The orifice is bounded in front by the fronto-nasal process winch covers the fore-brain and contains the anterior part of the coalesced trabeculfc cranii, behind by the mandibular arch, and laterally by the maxillary processes (fig. 202). With the in- FiG. 203.—The floor of the pharynx of a human embryo about fifteen days old. x 50. (From His.)

The salivary glands arise as diverticula from the epithelial Uning of the mouth, and their rudiments , ■, , i -u appear in the follo\ving order, viz. : the parotid durmg the fourth week, the sub maxillary in the sixth week, and the subUngual during the ninth week (Hammar) Fio. 204.—The floor of the pharynx of a human embryo about twenty-three days old.

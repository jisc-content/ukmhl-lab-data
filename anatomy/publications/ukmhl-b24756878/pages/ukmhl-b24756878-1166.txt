1148 SPLANCHNOLOGY close plexus, and throughout their course communicate freely with the lymijliatics from tlie mucous membrane, and empty themselves in the same manner into the origins of the lacteal vessels at the attached border of the gut. The nerves of the »mall inieslines are derived from the plexuses of sympathetic nerves around the superior mesenteric artery. From this source they run to a plexus of nei-\'es and gangha situated between the circular and longitudinal muscular fibres {Auerbnch'n plexus), from which the nervous branches are distributed to the muscular coats of the intestine. From this plexus a secondary plexus {Meissner's plexus) is derived, and is formed Fig. 950.—Meissner's plexus. (Klein and Noble Smith.) Multipolar ganglion-cells Single ganglion-cell bv branches which have perforated the cii-cular muscular fibres (fig. 950).

ANGIOLOGY 692 arise, which unite with similar branches from above and below, and thus a second series of arches is formed ; and from these latter, a third, a fourth, or even a fifth series of arches may be constituted, diminishing in size the nearer they approach the intestine. From the terminal arches numerous small straight vessels arise which encircle the intestine, upon which they are distributed, ramifying between its coats. Throughout their course small branches are given off to the lymphatic glands and other structures between the layers of the mesentery. The ileo-colic (a. ileocolica) is the lowest branch given off from the concavity of the superior mesenteric artery. It passes downwards and to the right behind the peritoneum towards the right iUac fossa, where it dmdes into two branches. Of these the inferior division anastomoses with the termination of the superior mesenteric artery ; the superior division anastomoses with the right colic. The descending branch of the ileo-colic runs towards the upper border of the ileo-ceecal junction and supplies the following branches : (a) colic, which passes up^vards on the ascending colon ; (b) arUerior avd 'posterior ccBcaZ which are distributed to the front and back of the ^^^^"^ (a. appendicularis) which passes downwards behind the termmation of the ileum and Fig. 606.—Arteries of csecum and vermiform appendix. ^Terminal part of ileo-colic GcEcal branches Ileal branches <^/-/n appei' ™,. in the me.o-.ppe„di.otoe to its t™gi„ for the ^ |j ""I"'J/fS?

ATLANTO-AXIAL ARTICULATIONS 379 Movements—Tliis joint allows the rotation of the atlas (and, with it, of the cranium) ujion the axis, the extent of rotation being limited by the odontoid lisaments. Fig. 428.—Occipito-atlantal and atlanto-axial ligaments. Posterior view. Arch for passage of vertebral arferi/ and first cervical nerve The opposed articular siirfaces of the atlas and axis are not reciprocally curved ; both surfaces are convex in their long axes. When, therefore, the upper facet ghdes forwards on the lower it also descends ; the fibres of the capsular hgament Fig. 429.—Ai-ticulation between odontoid process and atlas. are relaxed in a vertical direction, and will then permit of movement in an antero- posterior direction. By this means a shorter capsule suffices and the strength of the joint is materially increased.* * Corner (' The Physiology of the Atlanto-axial Joints,' Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. xli.) states that the movements which take place at these articulations arc of a complex nature. The first part of the movement is an eccentric or asymmetrical one ; the atlanto- axial joint of the side to which the head is moved is fixed, or practically fixed, by the muscles of the neck, and forms the centre of the movement, while the opposite atlantal facet is carried downwards and forwards on the corresponding axial facet. The second part of the movement IS centric and symmetrical, the odontoid process forming the axis of the movement.

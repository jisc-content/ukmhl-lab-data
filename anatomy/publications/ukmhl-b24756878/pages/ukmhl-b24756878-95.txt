EMBEYOLOGY THE term Embryology, in its widest sense, is applied to the vanous changes which take place during the growth of an animal from the egg to the adult condition : it is, however, usually restricted to the phenomena which occur before birth. It may be studied from two aspects : (1) that of oniofifeny, which deals only with the development of the individual; and (2) that of fhylogeny, which concerns itself with the evolutionary history of the ammal langdom. In all vertebrate animals the development of a new being can only take place when a female germ-cell or ovum has been fertihsed by a male germ-cell or spema- tozoiin. The ovum is a nucleated ceU, and all the compHcated changes by which the various tissues and organs of the body are formed from it, after it has been fertilised, are the result of two general processes, viz. segmentation and dijjerentiation Fig. 93.—Ovum of rabbit.

Thus, the fertilised ovum undergoes repeated segmentation into a number of cells which at first closely resemble one another, but are, sooner or later, differentiated into two groups : (1) somatic cells, the function of which is to build up the various tissues of the body; and (2) germinal cells, which become imbedded in the sexual glands—the ovaries in the female and the testes in the male —and are destined for the perpetuation of the species. Having regard to the main purpose of this work, it is impossible, in the space available in this chapter, to describe fully, or illustrate adequatelj^ all the phenomena which occur in the different stages of the development of the human body. The principal facts only will be given—the student being referred for further details to one or other of the text-books on human embryolog}'.

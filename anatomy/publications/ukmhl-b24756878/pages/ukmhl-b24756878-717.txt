INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY 699 The branches of the internal iliac are : From the Anterior Trunk. From the Posterior Trunk. Superior vesical. Iho-lumbar. Middle vesical. Lateral sacral. Inferior vesical. Gluteal. Middle hsemorrhoidal. Obturator. Internal pudic. . , y tr ^^^^^^^^ In the female. The superior vesical (a. vesicalis superior) suppUes numerous branches to the upper part of the bladder. From one of these a slender vessel, the artery to the vas deferens, takes origin and accompanies the vas deferens m its course to the testis, where it anastomoses with the spermatic artery. Other branches supply the ureter. As already explained, the first part of the superior vesical artery represents the terminal section of the pervious portion of the hypogastric artery. The middle vesical (a. vesicaUs media), usually a branch of the superior, is distributed to the base of the bladder and under surface of the yesiculse semiiiales. The inferior vesical (a. vesicaUs inferior) frequently arises in common with the middle htemorrhoidal, and is distributed to the base of the bladder, the prostate gland, and the vesiculffi seminales. The branches to the prostate communicate Avith the corresponding vessels of the opposite side. The middle hsemorrhoidal (a. hsemorrhoidaUs media) usually arises together with the preceding vessel. It is distributed to the rectum, anastomosing with the inferior vesical and with the superior and inferior hEemorrhoidal arteries. It gives offsets to the seminal vesicle and prostate gland. The uterine (a. uterina) (fig. 609) springs from the anterior division of the internal iUac and runs inwards on the Levator ani towards the cervix uteri; about Fig. 609.â€”The arteries of the internal organs of generation of the female, seen from behind.

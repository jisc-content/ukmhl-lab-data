ANGIOLOGY 738 presents the openings of the superior cerebral vems, winch run, for the most part from behind forwards, and open chiefly at the back part of the smus, their orifices being concealed by fibrous folds; numerous fibrous bands (chordcB Willisii) extend transversely across the mferior angle of the sirius ; and lastly small openmgs communicate with venous lacunw m the dura mater, into' wliich small white bodies, the glandules Pacchionn, project. The FiO 630 —Superior longitudinal sinus laid open after removal of the 8kull-oap. The chorda3 VVillisu are clearly seen. The parasinoidal sinuses are also we 1 shown; from two of them probes are passed into the superior longitudmal sinus. (1 oiner and Charpy.)

1134 SPLANCHNOLOGY The portion between the sulcus intermedius and the duodeno-pyloric con- striction is termed the jnjloric canal. At its commencement the greater curvature is covered by peritoneum continuous with tliat covering the front of the organ. The left part of the curvature gives attachment to the gastro- splenic omentum, while to its anterior portion are attaclied the two layers of the great omentum, separated from each other by the gastro-epiploic vessels. Surfaces.—Wlien the stomacli is in the contracted condition, its surfaces are directed upwards and downwards respectively, but when tlie viscus is distended they are directed forwards and backwards. They may therefore be described as antero-superior and postero-inferior. Antero-superior surface.—The left half of this surface is in contact with the Diaphragm, which separates it from the base of the left lung, the pericardium, and the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs and intercostal spaces of the left side. The right half is in relation vfith. the left and quadrate lobes of the liver and with the anterior abdominal wall. When the stomach is empty, the transverse colon may lie on the front part of this surface. The whole surface is covered by peritoneum. The postero-inferior surface is in relation wth the Diaphragm, the spleen, the left suprarenal gland, the upper part of the front of the left kidney, the anterior surface of the pancreas, the splenic flexure of the colon, and tlie upper layer of the transverse mesocolon. These structures form a shallow bed, the stomach bed, on which the viscus rests. The transverse mesocolon separates the stomach from the duodeno-jejunal flexure and small mtestme. The postero-inferior surface is coverecl by peritoneum, except over a small area close to the cardiac orifice ; tliis area is limited by the Unes of attachment of the gastro-phrenic ligament, and lies in apposition with the Diaphragm, and frequently the upper portion of the left suprarenal gland. Componeni parts of the stomach.—The stomach is capable of subdivision into distinctive parts, and the divisions may be made on either anatomical or physiological grounds. ATiatoniiml subdivisions.—A plane passing through the incisura angulai-LS on the lesser curvature and the left lunit of the opposed dilatation (pyloric vestibule) on the greater curvatm-e divides the stomach into a left portion or body and a right or pyloric portion. The left portion of the body is ]inown as the fundus, and is marked off from the remamder of the body by a plane passing through the cardiac orifice and a point on the greater curvature dkectly opposite. The pyloric portion is divided into a right part the pyloric canal, and a left, the pyloric vestibule, by a plane through the sulcus intermedius at right angles to the long axis of this portion (fig. 933). . , -, . ^, t j Physiological subdivisions.—li the stomach be exammed during the process of digestion it will be found divided by a muscular constriction into a large di ated left portion, and a narrow contracted tubular right portion. The constriction is in the body of the stomach and does not follow any of the anatomical landmarks; indeed it shifts gr^d^^^' the left as digestion progresses, i.e. more of the body is gradually absorbed into the ubula part. These two portions are knomi as the fimd^is and pyloric portions. It _^vlIl be seen therefore that the physiological fundus includes the anatomical fundus ^.l^^ he p oximal part o£ the body, while the physiological pyloric portion comprises the distal pait ol the body, the pyloric vestibule and the pyloric canal (fig. 934). fi,p Position of the stomach.-The position of the stomach vanes with the amount of he stomach contents and mth the condition of the intestines on which it rests. \ ana ion n ^he Lount S its contents affects only the physiological fundus, the py o^^^^ portion reraainincr in a more or less contracted condition during the i^rocess of digestion.

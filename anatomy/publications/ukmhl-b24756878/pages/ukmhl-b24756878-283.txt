THE SKULL ^ROM BELOW 265 magnum transmits the medulla oblongata and its membranes, the spinal acces- sory nerves, the vertebral arteries, the anterior and posterior spinal arteries, and the occipito-axial ligaments. The mid-points on the anterior and posterior margins of the foramen magnum are respectively termed the hasion and the opislhion. In front of each condjde is the anterior condyloid foramen, for the passage of the hypoglossal nerve and a meningeal artery. Behind each condyle is the fossa condyloidea, perforated on one or both sides by the posterior condyloid foramen, for the transmission of a vein from the lateral sinus. Behind the foramen magnum is the external occipital crest, terminating above at the external occipital protuberance, while on either side are the superior and inferior curved lines; these, as well as the surfaces of bone between them, are rough for the attachment of the muscles which are enumerated on page 215. The Skull in Profile (norma lateralis) When viewed from the side (fig. 339) the skull is seen to consist of the cranium above and behind, and of the face below and in front. The cranium is some- what ovoid in shape, but its contour varies in different cases and depends largely on the length and height of the skuU and on the degree of prominence of the supercihary ridges and frontal eminences. Entering into its formation Fig. 339.â€”Side view of the skull. are to be seen the frontal, the parietal, the occipital, the temporal, and the greater wing of the sphenoid. These bones are joined to one another and to the malar by the following sutures : the zygomatico-temporal between the zygomatic process of the temporal and the temporal process of the malar; the fronto-malar uniting the malar with the external angular process of the frontal;

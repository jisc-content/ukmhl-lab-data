722 ANGIOLOGY the Extensor proprius liallucis ; on its fibular side, the innermoBt tendon of the Extensor longus digitorum, and the termination of the anterior tibial nerve. It is accompanied by two veins. Peculiarities in size.-Tho dorsal artery of the foot may be larger than usual, to compe^X or a deficient plantar artery; or its terminal branches to the toes ay be abS tte toes then being supplied by the internal plantar ; or its place may be taken ^^*°lSn'LVhTart^^^^^ lying external to the line between of the foot by a drawn from the centre of the space between the two malleoh to the side.

The lower part, or filum tenninale externum., is closely mvested by, and is adherent to, the dura mater • it extends downwards from the apex of the sheath and js attaclied to the back of the first segment of the coccyx. Tlie filum termmale consists mainly ot fibrous tissue, continuous above with that of the pia mater Adhering to its outer surface, however, are a few strands of nerve-fibres which probably represent rudimentary second and thud coccygeal nerves ; further, the central canal of the spmal cord extends do^™wards into it for two or three mches Enlargrements.-The spinal cord is not quite cyhndrical, being shghtly flattened from before backwards ; nor is it of uniform circumference throughout, but presents two swellings or enlargements, an upper or cervical, , '"'l^iS X-'£ SSmescentia cervicalis) is the more pronounced of the two and corresponds with the attachments of the large nerves which supply t e upper limbs.

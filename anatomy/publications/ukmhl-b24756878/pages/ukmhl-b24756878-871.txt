853 THE THIRD VENTRICLE epithelial roof into the ventricular cavity. When the velum interpositum is reflected, the epithelial roof is torn from its lateral attachments and removed with it, and the cavity of the ventricle is exposed. The floor slopes downwards and forwards and is formed mainly by the structures which constitute the hypothalamus : from before backwards these ^ are, the optic commissure, the tuber cinereum and infundibulum, and the corpora mamillaria. Behind the last, the floor is formed by the locus perforatus posticus and tlie tegmenta of the crura cerebri. The ventricle is prolonged downwards as a funnel-shaped recess, the recessus infundibuli, into the infundibulum, and to the apex of the latter the pituitary body is attached. The anterior boundary is constituted below by the lamina terminalis, a thin layer of grey matter which stretches from the upper surface of the optic YiQ. 725.—Base of brain. ■Frontal lobe Temporal lobe Occipital lobe commissure to the rostrum of the corpus callosum, and above by the anterior pillars of the- fornix and the anterior commissure. At the junction of the noor and anterior wall, immediately above the optic commissure, the ventricle presents a small angular recess or diverticulum, the optic or stipra- opttc recess. Between the anterior pillars of tlie fornix and above the anterior commissure is a second recess termed the vulva. At the junction ot tlie roof and anterior wall of the ventricle, and situated between the caalami behind and the anterior pillars of the fornix in front, is the foramen oj Monro (foramen interventriculare) through which the third communicates with the lateral ventricles. The posterior boundary is constituted by the pineal body, the posterior ommissure and the aqueduct of Sylvius. A small recess, the recessus pinealis.

Here the two saccules, which in the second type were uniform, have grown at unequal rates : the right with greater rapidity than the left. In consequence of this an apparently new apex has been formed by the growing downwards of the right saccule, and the original apex, mth the appendix attached, is pushed over to the left towards the ileo-ca;cal junction. The three longitudinal bands still start from the base of the appendix, but they are now no longer equidistant from each other because the right saccule has grown between the anterior and postero- external bands, pushing them over to the left. Tliis type occurs m about 90 per cent, of cases. The fourth type is merely an exaggerated condition of the third ■ the right saccule'is still larger, and at the same time the left saccule has become atrophied, so that the original apex of the caecum, AMth the appendix, is close to the ileo-cffical junction, and the anterior band courses inwards to the same situation. This type is present in about 4 per cent, of cases. The vermiform appendix (processus vermiformis) is a long, narrow, worm-shaped tube, which starts from what was originally the apex of the csecum. and may pass in several directions : upwards behind the caecum ; to the left behind the ileum and mesentery ; or downwards into the true pelvis. It varies from one to nine inches in length, its average being a httle over three inches (8-3 cm.). It is retained in position by a fold of peritoneum the meso- appmdix, denied from the left leaf of the mesentery. This fo d, in the majority of cases, is more or less triangular m shape, and as a rule extends aloig the entire length of the tube. Between its two layers hes a ^c^^f^ f branch of the ileo-coUc artery, the appendicular artery (fig 951 . The canal of the appendix is small, extends throughout the whole ^^^g^j^ ° communicates with the csecum by an orifice which is placed belo^^ and behind ?h?iTeo^S opening. It is sometimes guarded by a semilunar valve formed by aloiroTmucous membrane, but this is by no means constant.

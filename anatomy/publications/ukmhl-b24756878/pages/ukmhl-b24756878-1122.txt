1104 SPLANCHNOLOGY mucous membrane. Its apex (apex lingua;), thin and narrow, is directed forwards against the inner surfaces of the lower incisor teetii. Its under sicrface (facies inferior) is connected with the mandible by the Genio-hyo-glossus muscles ; from its sides, the mucous membrane is reflected to the inner surface of the gums ; and from its under surface on to the floor of the mouth, where, in the middle line, it is elevated into a distinct vertical fold, tlie frenulum linguce. To the outer side of the frenulum is a slight fold of the mucous membrane, the plica fimbriata, the free edge of which exhibits a series of fringe- like processes. The tip of the tongue, part of the under surface, its sides, and dorsum are free. The dorsum of the tongue (dorsum linguae) (fig. 913) is convex, marked along the middle line by a furrow (sulcus medianus), which divides it into symmetrical Fig, 913.—^Upper surface of the tongue.

The brandies of the facial nerve cross the artery, and the infra-orbital nerve lies beneath it. The branches of the facial artery may be divided into two sets given olf below the mandible (cervical), and those on the face (facial). Facial Branches. Inferior labial. The ascending palatine (a. palatina ascendeus) (fig. 580) passes up between the Stylo-glossus and Stylo-pharyngeus to the outer side of the pharynx, along Fig. 576.—The arteries of the face and scalp.* Angular ^Lateral nasal lor arlerp thi' M-pium Superior coronaru Iiiferior coronary Inferior labial which it is continued between the Superior constrictor and the Internal pterygoid to near the base of the skull. It divides, near the Levator palati, into two branches : one follows the course of the Levator palati, and, winding over the upper border of the Superior constrictor, supplies the soft palate and the palatine glands, anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side and with the posterior palatine branch of the internal maxillary artery ; the other ])icrccs the Superior constrictor and supplies the tonsil and Eustachian tube, anastomosing witli the tonsillar and ascending pharyngeal arteries. ♦ The rauscular tissue of the lips must be supposed to have been cut away, in order to show the course of the coronaiy arteries.

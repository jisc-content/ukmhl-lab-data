NEUROLOGY 966 of the Deltoid renders abduction of the arm to the horizontal level impossible. The associated paralysis of the Teres minor is not easilj' demonstrated. Hilton takes the circumflex nerve as an illustration of a law which he lays down, that ' the same trunks of nerves whose branches supply the groups of muscles moving a joint, furnish also a distribution of nerves to the skin over the insertions of the same muscles, and the interior of the joint receives its nerves from the same souree.' In this way he explains the fact that an inflamed joint becomes rigid. The median nerve is liable to injury in wounds of the forearm. When it is paralysed, there is loss of flexion of the second phalanges of all the fingers, and of the terminal phalanges of the index and middle fingers. Flexion of the terminal phalanges of the ring and little fingers is effected by that portion of the Flexor profundus digitorum which is supplied by the ulnar nerve. There is power to flex the proximal phalanges through the Interossei. The thumb cannot be flexed or opposed, and is maintamed in a position of extension and adduction. There is loss in the power of pronating the forearm ; the Brachio-radialis has the power of bringmg the forearm into a position of mid-pronation, but beyond this no further pronation can be effected. The wist can be flexed, if the hand is first adducted, by the action of the Flexor carpi ukiaris. There is loss or impair- ment of sensation on the palmar surfaces of the thumb, index, middle, and outer half of vine fingers, and on the dorsal surfaces of the same fingers over the last two phalanges ; exc^ept in the thumb, where the loss of sensation would be limited to the back of the last phalanx In old cases the unopposed action of the Interossei produces backward dislocation of the interphalangeal jomts. The thumb is extended and adducted to the index, cannot be flexed or abducted, and cannot "be apposed to any one of the fingers; m consequence an 'ape-like' hand is produced. In order to expose the median nerve, for the purpose of unitmg the divided ends, supposing the injury to be just above the wrist, an incision should be made along the radial side of the tendon of the Palmaris longus, which serves as a guide to the nerve. , . , , -nn i The ulnar nerve is also liable to be injured m wounds of the forearm. WTien paralysKi, there is impaled power of ukiar flexion, and upon an attempt bemg made to Hex tlie wrist the hand is drawn to the radial side from paralysis of the Flexor carpi uhiaris : there is inability to spread out the fingers from paralysis of the Interossei and tor tlie same reason the fingers, especially the ring and little fingers, cannot be flexed at the meta- carpo-phalangeal jomts or extended at the interphalangeal joints, and the hand assumes a claw shape from the action of the opposing muscles ; there is loss of power of flexion in the little and rmg fingers ; and there is inability to adduct the thumb. The muscles of the hvpothenar eminence become wasted. Sensation is lost, or impau-ed, in the skm supplied by the nerve. U order to expose the nerve in the lower part of the forearm, an incision should be made along the outer border of the tendon of the Flexor carpi uhiaris, and the nerve will be found lying on the ulnar side of the ulnar artery. The musculo-spiral nerve is probably more frequently mjured than any other nerve of the upper extremity. In consequence of its close relationship to the ^^^merus as it lies in the musculo-spiral groove, it is often torn or mjured m fractures of this bone or subsequently involved in the callus that may be thrown out around a f'-actu e and thus pressed upon and its functions interfered ^dth. It is also liable to be contused against the bone by kicks or blows, or to be divided by wounds of the arm. When pai^lysed the hand is flexed at the wrist and lies flaccid.

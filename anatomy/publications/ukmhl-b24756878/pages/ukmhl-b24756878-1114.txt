SPLANCHNOLOGY 1096 Tlie crown is nearly cubical in form, convex on its labial and lingual surfaces, flattened on its proximal and distal aspects ; tlie upper surface is surmounted by four or five tubercles, or cusps (four in the upper, five in the lowei' molars) ,'sei)arated from eacli other by a crucial depression ; lience the molars are sometimes termed muUicuspids. The neck is distinct, large, and rounded. The root is subdivided into two or tlu'ee fangs : tlu-ee in the teetli of the upper jaw, and two in those of the lower. Each of these fangs presents an aperture at its summit. The crown of tlie first molar tooth in the upper jaw has usually four cusps ; the root consists of three fangs, widely separated from one another, two benig labial, the other lingual. . . , ^ r The crown of the first molar tooth in the lower jaw is larger than that ot tlie upper • it has five cusps, and its root consists of two fangs, one being placed ' proximally, the other distally : they Fig. 904.—Temporary teeth. Left side. are both compressed from before back- wards, and grooved on their contiguous faces, indicating a tendency to division. The second molar is a little smaller than the first. The crown has three or four cusps in the upper, and usually five in the lower jaw. The root has three fangs in the upper ]a.\v, and two in the lower, the characters of which are similar to those of the preceding tooth. The third molar tooth is called the wisdom-tooth or dens sapieniice (dens serotinus), from its late appearance through the gum. Its crown is nearly as large as that of the second molar, but is smaller than that of the first. In the upper jaw it is usually furnished with three cusps, the two lingual ones being blended ; in the lower jaw there are five cusps as m the other molars. The root is generaUy single, short, conical, slightly curved, and grooved so as to present traces of a subdivision into three fangs in the upper, and t^o in the lower jaw. Temporary Teeth (Dentes decidxh) (fig. 904) The temporary, or milk teeth, are smaller than, but, generaUy speaking, resemble in form, the teeth wliich bear the same names m the permanent set^ The hinder of the two temporary molars is the largest of all the milk teeth, and is succeeded by the second permanent bicuspid. The first upper molar has onl^ I'e cuspV-Uvo labial, oL lingual ; the second upper -Jl^ The first lower molar has four cusps ; the second loMcr mola J^as e li e fangs of the temporary molar teeth are smaUer and more divergent tban tho.e of the permanent set, but in other respects bear a strong resemblance to them.

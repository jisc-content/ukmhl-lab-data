FORM OF THE EMBRYO AT DIFFERENT STAGES 179 and the ocular and auditory vesicles are formed. Four visceral clefts are present; the stomatodffium is well marked, and the bucco-pharyngeal membrane has dis- appeared. The rudiments of the limbs are seen as short buds, and the Wolffian bodies are visible (fig. 243). , , . i • ^, Fourth Tl'eeifc.—The embryo is markedly curved on itself, and when viewed in prohle is almost circular in outline. The cerebral hemispheres appear as hollow buds, and the elevations which form the rudiments of the pinna are visible. The limbs now appear as oval flattened projections (fig. 244). Fig. 244.—Human embryo, twenty-seven to thirty days old. (His.) Heart Fifth Week.—The embryo is less curved and the head is relatively of large size. Differen- tiation of the limbs into their segments occurs. The nose forms a short, flattened projection.. The genital tubercle is evident (fig. 245). Sixth Week.—'the curvature of the embryo is further diminished. The visceral clefts— except the first—have disappeared, and the rudiments of the fingers and toea can be recognised (fig. 246). Fig. 245.—Human embryo, thirty-one to thirty-four days old. (His.) Heart Hind-limb Seventh and Eighth Weeks.—The flexure of the head is gradually reduced and the neck is somewhat lengthened. The upper lip is completed and the nose is more prominent. The nostrils are directed forwards and the palate is not completely developed. The eyelids are present in the shape of folds above and below the eye, and the different parts of the pinna are distinguishable. By the end of the second month the foetus measures from 28 to 30 mm. in length (fig. 247). N 2

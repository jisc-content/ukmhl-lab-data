988 NEUROLOGY The position of the external popliteal, close behind the tendon of the Biceps on the outer side of the ham, should be remembered in subcutaneous division of the tendon. After the tendon is divided, a cord often rises up close beside it, which might be mistaken for a small undivided portion of the tendon, and the surgeon might be tempted to reintro- duce his knife and cut it. This must never be done, as the cord is the external popliteal nerve, which becomes prominent as soon as the tendon is divided. Where this nerve winds' round the neck of the fibula, it is also liable to be severed accidentally if its exact situation is not kept in mind, and especial care must be used when dealmg wnth smuses leading do^™ to carious bone in this situation. Section of the nerve results m complete ' foot-drop ' from paralysis of the anterior tibial group of muscles and mversion of the foot from the unopposed action of the Tibialis posticus, the Peronei bemg paralysed, together with anesthesia of the parts supplied by the nerve, and, owmg to loss of nutrition, the limb frequently becomes blue and cold, and may develop ' trophic ' sores. THE SYMPATHETIC NERVES The sympathetic nerves (fig. 816 ) are distributed to tlie viscera and blood-vessels * and are intimately connected with the spmal and certam ot the cranial nerves. They are cliaracterised by tlie presence of numerous ganglia which may be divided into three groups, central, collateral, and ^^^^ehentral ganglia are arranged in two vertical rows, one on either side of the middle line, situated partly in front and partly at the sides of the vertebral column. Each ganglion is joined by intervening nervous trunks to adjacent ganglia so that two chains or cords are formed, the gangliated cords of the sympathetic. The collateral ganglia are found m connection with three great prevertebral plexuses, placed within the thorax, abdomen and pelvis respectively, while the terminal ganglia are located m the walls ot the ""'^ Tlfetangliated cords (trunci sympathici) extend from the base of the skull to the coccyx. The cranial end of each is continued upwards through the carotid canal into the skuU, and forms a plexus on the internal carotid artery ; the lower ends of the two cords converge and end in a smgle ganghon the ganglion impar, placed in front of the coccyx The gangha of each cord are distinguished as cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral, ^'^d, except m the neck they closely correspond in number to the vertebrae. They are arranged thus : • Cervical portion 3 ganglia Thoracic , Lumbar ,, ^ r " Sacral „ 4 or 5 „ In the neck the ganglia he in front of the transverse processes of the vertebrL in the thortcif region in front of the heads of the ribs : m the lumbar r^gSn on the sides of the vertebral bodies ; and in the sacral region '^:l^:rSZ^t^e spinal nerve.-Commumcat^r. a^ e^^^^ between the sympathetic and spinal nerves through what aie knoM ii as tlie yrcy ''s^lZMtl.^.^^uLmunicantes W 7?0) ; the grey ^^-^^^^^St^ fibrps into the spinal nerves and the white rami transmittmg spmai noieb Tnto the svmt^ltlS^^ Each spinal nerve receives a grey ramus communicans r m the g^g?^^^^^^^^ of tlfe sympathetic, by all the sphial nerves.

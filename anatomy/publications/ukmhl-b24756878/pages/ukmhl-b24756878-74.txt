This layer is most marked in arteries of medium size. In the largest vessels the external coat is relatively thiu ; but in small arteries it is of greater proportionate thickness. In the smaller arteries it consists of a single layer of white con- nective tissue and elastic fibres ; while in the smallest arteries, just above the capillaries, the elastic fibres are wanting, and the con- nective tissue of which the coat is composed becomes more nearly homogeneous the nearer it approaches the capillaries, and is gradually reduced to a thin - ^ Some'arteries have extrenu.ly thin ^jf/P^^jS^^a^^^u.! and vertebral especially the case in those f^t^ exten al and middle coats, canal, the difference depending on the ^hiuM^s ot f^e ^x^^ - i„ thm The arteries, in their distribution tlnongho t tte l3oaj ^^^^^^^^ fibro-arcolar investments, which form their sheaths. a.

ANGIOLOGY 668 the artery on three sides, and separates it from direct contact with the vein and adjacent muscles. The third portion of the axillary artery extends from the lower border of the Pectoralis minor to the lower border of the tendon of the Teres major. In front., it is covered by the lower part of the Pectoralis major above, but only by the integument and fascia below ; behind, it is in relation with the lower part of the Subscapularis, and the tendons of the Latissimus dorsi and Teres major ; on its Fig. 694.—The axillary artery and its branches. outer side is the Coraco-brachialis, and on its inner, or thoracic side, the axillary vein. The nerves of the brachial plexus bear the following relations to this part of the artery : on the outer side are the outer head and trunk of the median, and the musculo-cutaneous for a short distance ; on the inner side the ulnar (between the vein and artery) and lesser internal cutaneous nerves (to the mner side of the vein); in front are the inner head of the median and the internal cutaneous, and behind, the musculo-spiral and circumflex, the latter only as far as the lower border of the Subscapularis. Surface Marking.—The course of the axillary artery may be marked out by raising the arm to a right angle and drawing a line from the middle of the clavicle to the point where the tendon of the Pectoralis major crosses the prominence caused by the Coraco- brachialis as it emerges from under cover of the anterior fold of the axilla, ilie tliira portion of the artery can be felt pulsatmg beneath the skin and fascia, at the junction ot the anterior with the middle third of the space between the anterior and posterior lolOs of the axilla, close to the inner border of the Coraco-brachialis. A vvlied Anatomy.-Compression ot the vessel maybe required in the reniova oi tumours, or in amputation of the upper part of the arm ; and the only situation in which this can be effectually made is in the lower part of its course ; by pressing on it in this situation from within outwards against the humcnis, the circulation may be effectually With the exception of the pophteal, the axillary artery is perhaps more fre:quentl.v lacerated than any other artery in the body by violent '^o^''^'^°"^f' ^^P^^'^^.l'^;" cases where its coats are diseased.

26 HISTOLOGY Fig. 33.—From a transverse section of the diaphysis of the humerus. Magnified. tissue supporting numerous blood-vessels and cells, most of which are fat-cells, but some arc ' nmrrow-cells,' such as occur in the red marrow to be immediate y described. In the flat and short bones, in the articular ends of the long bones in the bodies of the vertebra, in the cranial diploe, and m the sternum and nbs the marrow is of a red colour, and conta ns, m 100 parts, 75 of ^^'^Jf'^f^^S ^f solid matter consisting of cell-globulin, nucleo-protein, extractives salts, and only a small ropo t'o^of fS. The red marrow consists of a small quantity of connective tissue LoclvesiS, and numerous cells (fig. 32), some few of which are fat-ceUs, but the eieat maiority are romidish nucleated ceUs, the true ' marrow-cells of KSUikei These marrow-cells proper, or myeloajtes, resemb e in appearance Who d corpuscles, and Uke them are amoeboid ; they generally have a hyahne Splasm though some show granules either oxyphil or basophil in reaction I number^f eosinophil cells are also present. Among the marrow-cells may be ;ee"smaierc3s, w'hich possess a slightly pinkish hue ; t^ese are the .^^^^^^^^^^ or normoblasts from which, as we have seen, the red corpuscles of the adult are der"and wMch may be regarded as descendants of the nucleated coloured coiSerof the embryo. Giant-cells {myeloplaxes osteoclasts) larg^, multi- protoplasmic Isses, are also to be ^^^t^^^^^. They were beheved by Kolliker to be concerned in the absorption of bone-matrix, and hence the name which he gave to them—osteoclasis. They excavate in the bone small shallow pits or ca^dties, which are named HowsJivp's lacuncB, and in these they are found Mng. Vessels and nerves of bone.— The blood-vessels of bone are very numerous. Those of the compact tissue are derived from a close and dense network of vessels ramifying in the periosteum. From this mem- brane vessels pass into the minute orifices in the compact tissue, .and run through the canals which traverse its substance. The can- cellous tissue is suppHed in a similar way, but by less numerous and larger vessels, which, perforating the outer compact tissue, are distributed to the cavities of the spongy portion of the bone. In the long bones, numerous apertures may be seen at the end, near tUe arfoula, surlacea »,ne of the,e gWc passage ^" "^er-ej apertures arc toi tue veins oi uno sunuhed by one large wUch transimt, to the .<^«"'™l ^^^^^ medullary arteries and veins. ^''^ ™'' "^^^^ (3) immerolls large (Kaiikor)-(l) one or two largo ve us W "^'^sUl veins pass out ot Ld small veins emerge at the artrcular eu^^^^^^^^^^^ 4** a.

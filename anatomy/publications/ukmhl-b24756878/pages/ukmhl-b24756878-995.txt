LUMBAR PLEXUS 977 Tlie branch to the Vastus internum is a long filament running down on the outer side of tlic femoral vessels in company with the internal saphenous nerve. It enters the muscle about its middle, and gives off a filament, which can usually be traced downwards, on the surface of the muscle, to the knee-joint. The branches to the Crureus are two or three m number, and enter tlie muscle on its anterior surface about the middle of the thigh ; a filament from one of these descends through the mu.scle to the Subcrureus and tlie knee-joint. The articular branch to the hip-joint is derived from the nerve to the Rectus. Fig. 809.—Plan of sacral and pudendal plexuses.

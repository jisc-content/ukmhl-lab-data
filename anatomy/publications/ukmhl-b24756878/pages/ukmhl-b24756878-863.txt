845 THE FORE-BRAIN is concealed by the corpus callosum, and is covered by a fold of pia mater, named the velum interpositum ; inferiorly it reaches to the base of the brain. The diencej^halon compiises : (1) the thalamencephalon : (2) the pars mamillaria h3'pothalarai ; and (3) the posterior part of the third ventricle. For descriptive purposes, however, it is more convenient to consider the whole of the third ventricle and its boundaries together : this necessitates the inclusion, under this heading, of the pars optica hypothalami and the corresponding part of the third ventricle—structures which properly belong to the telencephalon. The thalamencephalon consists of : (1) the thalamus : (2) the meta- thalamus or corjjora geniculata ; and (3) the epithalamus, whicli comprises the trigonum habenulfe, the pineal body, and the posterior commissure. Fig. 717.—^The tliii-d and fourth ventricles. The lower arrow has been placed in the aqueduct of Sylvius; the upper points to the foramen of Monro. Tile thalami or optic thalami (figs. 717, 718) are two large ovoid masses, situated one on either side of the third ventricle and reaching for some distance belund that cavity. Each measures about an inch and a half in lengtli, and presents two extremities, an anterior and posterior, and four surfaces, superior, interior, internal, and external. The anterior extremity is narrow, directed forwards and inwards, and lies Close to the middle line, where it forms the posterior boundary of the foramen of Monro. Che posterior extremity is expanded, directed backwards and outwards, and. overlaps tlie superior quadrigeminal body. Internally, it presents a velJ-inarlicd angular prominence, the posterior tubercle or pulvinar, wliich

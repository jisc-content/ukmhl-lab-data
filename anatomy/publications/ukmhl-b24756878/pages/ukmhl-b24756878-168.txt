EMBRYOLOGY 150 of some of the radicles of the azygos veins. At its connection with the cisterna chyli it is at first double, but the right vessel soon joins with the left. ' All the lymph-sacs except the cisterna chyli are, at a later stage, divided up by slender connective tissue bridges and transformed into groups of IjTnphatic glands. The lower portion of the cisterna chyli is similarly converted, but its upper portion remains as the receptaculum chyli. The Pericardium.—As already pointed out (page 87), the anterior portion of the embryonic area in front of the oral plate or bucco-pharyngeal membrane is named the pericardial area. Previous to the formation of the head-fold the mesoderm has divided into its somatic and splanchnic layers, and these two layers together with the intervening coelomic space, extend forwards on either side of the bucco-pharyngeal membrane into the pericardial area ; the part of the coelom contained within this area becomes the cavity of the pericardium. This is, at first, in the shape of a crescent, the lateral horns of which extend backwards on either side of the bucco-pharyngeal membrane and are continuous with the pleuro-peritonea part of the coslomic space. The primitive blood-vessels, which, in the pericardial region, fuse to form the primitive heart, are developed in the splanchnic mesoderm of the pericardial area. By the rapid elongation of the embryo and the formation of the head-fold, the pericardial area and its contained blood-vessels are folded backwards to form the ventral wall of the fore-gut. By means of this process the surfaces of the pericardial area are reversed, its splanchnic layer bemg now situated on the dorsal aspect of its somatic layer, while its original anterior Umit comes to form the front boundary of the umbihcus. The viteUme veins, bringing the blood from the yolk-sac, enter the embryo through the anterior wall of the umbihcus and pass upwards and forwards to open into the tubular heart, which is, for a time, suspended along its entire length, from the ventral aspect of the fore-gut, by a dorsal mesentery (dorsal mesocardium) (fig. 225). By t^e absorption of the middle part of this dorsal mesocardium behind the ascendmg aorta and puhnonary artery the great transverse sinus of the pericardium is formed In amphibians and birds the pericardium is developed by the fusion of the lateral halves of the coelom in the middle hne beneath the fore-gut, and therefore in these animals there exists, for a period, a ventral mesocardium ; Robmson has shown that the pericardial cavity in mammals is from the first a smgle ca^aty, and that there is never at any time a ventral mesocardium. to The mesoderm immediately in front of the ^.^^bihcus becomes tlnckened t^ form the septum transversum, above which ai;e situated the lateral ^0"^^ «f pericardial cavity.

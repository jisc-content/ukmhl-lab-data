NEUROLOGY 922 fourth nerve being internal and resting on the Superior obhque the frontal resting on the Levator palpebral, and the lachrymal on the External rectus. The superior division of tlie third nerve hes immediately beneath the buperior rectus while the nasal branch of the ophthalmic crosses the optic nerve to reach the inner side of the orbit. Beneath these is the optic nerve, surrounded in front by the ciUary nerves, and having the lenticular ganglion on its outer side between it and the External rectus. Below the optic nerve are the iSerior division of the third, and the sixth, the latter lymg on the outer side of the orbit. AvpUed Anatomy—The sixth nerve is more frequently involved in fracture of the basf of the skull than any other cranial nerve. The result of paralysis of this nerve is internal or convergent squint. Diplopia is also present. When mjured so that its ftmSfon is destroved there is, in addition to the paralysis of the External rectus muscle, £ a ce" alfamSt of contraction of the pupil, because some of the sympathetic fibres to the radiating musoje of. the iris are conveyed through this nerve. Seventh Nerve (figs. 778, 779, 780) The Seventh or Facial nerve (n. faciahs),hke the fifth, consists of a motor and rsenslrrpart, the latter being frequently described under the name of thevmTSmedia of Wrisberg.

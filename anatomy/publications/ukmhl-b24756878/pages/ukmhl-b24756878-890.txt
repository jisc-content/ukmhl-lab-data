NEUROLOGY 872 into the roof of the descending cornu, where it terminates in the nucleus amvqdalce. at the apex of the temporal lobe. It is covered by the limng of the ventricle/and crossed by some veins of considerable size. It is separated from the extra-ventricular portion, in the greater part of its extent by a lamina of white matter, which is called the internal capsule, but the two nortions of the corpus striatum are united m front (fig. 741). The nucleus lenticularis (nucleus lentiformis), or extra-ventricular portion of the corpus striatum, is placed outside the caudate nucleus and thalamus, and is seen only in sections of the hemisphere When divided hoxSontally. it exhibits, to some extent, the appearance of a biconvex lens hUe a vertical transverse section of its central part presents a somewhat Irianmilar outlme It does not extend as far forwards or backwards as the nuS ^audat^s It s bounded externally by a lamina of white matter caUed Ze ellrZ clpsule, on the outer surface of which is a thm layer of grey matter tiiSd the dauslrum.

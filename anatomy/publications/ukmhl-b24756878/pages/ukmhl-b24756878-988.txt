NEUROLOGY 970 three and the greater part of the fourth are connected togetlier in this situation by anastomotic loops, and form the lumbar plexus. The smaller part of the fourth joins with the fifth to form the lumbosacral cord (truncus lumbosacralis), which assists in the formation of the sacral plexus. The fourth nerve is named the nervus furcalis, from the fact that it is subdivided between the two plexuses.* Lumbar Plexus (Plexus lumbalis) The lumbar plexus (fig. 804) is formed by the loops of communication between the anterior divisions of the first three and the greater part of the fourth lumbar nerves. The plexus is narrow above, and the first lumbar often receives a branch from the last thoracic nerve ; it is broad below, where it is joined to the sacral plexus by the lumbo-sacral cord. It is situated in the posterior part of the Psoas magnus, in front of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae.

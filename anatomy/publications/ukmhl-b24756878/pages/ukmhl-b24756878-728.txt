ANGIOLOGY 710 Scarpa's triangle (fig. 617 i corresponds to the depression seen immediately below the fold of tlie groin. Its apex is directed downwards, and the sides are formed externally by the inner margin of the Sartorius, internally by the inner margin of the Adductor longus, and above by Poupart's ligament. Tlie floor of the space is formed from without inwards by the Ihacus, Psoas, Pectineus, in some cases a small part of the Adductor brevis, and the Adductor longus ; and it is divided into two nearly equal parts by the femoral vessels, which extend from near the middle of its base to its apex : the artery giving off in this situation its cutaneous and profunda brandies, the vein receiving the deep femoral and internal saphenous tributaries. On the outer side of the femoral artery is the anterior crural nerve dividing into Fig. 617.â€”Scarpa's triangle.

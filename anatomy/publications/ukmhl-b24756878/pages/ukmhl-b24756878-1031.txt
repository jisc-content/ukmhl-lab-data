i013 THE EYE periods of life, being more pronounced in youth than in advanced life. The cornea is dense and of uniform thickness throughout; its posterior surface is perfectly circular in outline, and exceeds the anterior surface slightly in extent, from the latter being overlapped by the tissue of the sclera. Structure (fig. 833).—The cornea consists from before backwards of the four folloMdng layers, viz.: (1) a layer of stratified epithelium, continuous wdth that of the conjunctiva; (2) the substantia propria ; (3) a homogeneous elastic lamina ; and (4) a layer of endothehum. The stratified epithelium (epithelium cornese) covering the front of the cornea consists of several layers of cells. The cells of the deepest layer are columnar ; Fig. 833.—^Vertical section of human cornea from near the margin. (Waldeyer.) Magnified. 1. Epithelium. 2. Anterior liomogeneous lamina. 3.

Lastly, there are three or four layers of scaly epithelium, with flattened nuclei. The substantia propria is fibrous, tough, unyielding, perfectly transparent, and continuous with the sclera. It is composed of about sixty flattened lamellae, superimposed one on another. These lamellae are made up of bundles

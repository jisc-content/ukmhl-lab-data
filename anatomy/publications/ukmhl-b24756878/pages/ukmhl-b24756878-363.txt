345 TIBIA Capsular ligament Posterior surface. Capsular ligament Sti/loid process mdistinct below ; the inner and broader portion gives origin to the Flexor longus digitorum, the outer and nanwer to part of the Tibialis posticus. The remaining part of , . , the posterior surface is Fig. 398.â€”Bones of the right leg. smooth and covered by the Tibialis posticus, Flexor longus digitorum, and Flexor longus hal- hicis. Immediately below the oblique line is the medullary foramen, which is large and directed obliquely downwards. The lower extremity, much smaller than the upper, presents five sur- faces ; it is prolonged domiwards on its inner side as a strong process, the internal malleolus. The inferior surface (f acies articuiaris inferior) is quadrilateral, and smooth for articulation with the astragalus. It is concave from before backwards, broader in front than behind, and traversed from before backwards by a slight elevation, separating two lateral depressions. It is continuous internally with that on the inner malleolus. The anterior surface of the lower ex- tremity is smooth and rounded above, and covered by the tendons of the Extensor muscles of the toes; its lower margin presents a rough transverse depression for the attachment of the anterior ligament of the ankle-joint. The pos- terior surface is traversed by a shallow groove directed obliquely down- \vards and inwards, con- tinuous Avith a similar groove on the posterior surface of the astragalus, and serving for the pas- sage of the tendon of the Flexor longus hallucis. The external surface pre- sents a triangular rougli depression for the attach- ment of the inferior in- terosseous ligament con- necting it with the fibula; the lower part of this Articulates with astragalus Capsular ligament

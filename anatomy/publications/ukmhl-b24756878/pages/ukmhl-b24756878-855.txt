837 THE FOURTH VENTRICLE sulcus. Tliey divide the floor into two triangular areas, an ujDper and a lower, M-liich correspond, approximately, to the portions of the floor Ax liicli are formed by the back of the pons and medulla respectively. BeloM- the stria? acusticas, at a short distance from the median sulcus, on either side, is a small triangular depression, the inferior fovea, the apex of which is directed upwards, while its sides are prolonged downwards as divergent furrows. The inner of these furroM's is carried toM^ards the lower angle of tlie ventricle, the outer towards its lateral wall; and in this manner three small tri- angular areas are marked off on either side of the middle Ime. That which lies between the diverging furrows of the fovea is darker in colour than the other two, and is named the ala cinerea or irigoniim vagi ; it corresponds M'ith the position of the sensory nuclei of the vagus and glosso-pharyngeal nerves. The base of the trigonum vagi is crossed by a narrow translucent elevation named the :tuniculus separans, between which and the clava is a small tongue-shaped area, the area postrema. On section, it is seen that the funiculus separans IS formed by a strip of thickened ependyma, and that the area postrema is Fig. 710.—Floor of fourth ventricle.

552 MYOLOGY The deep palmar fascia (aponeurosis palmaris) (fig. 530) forms a common sheath which invests the muscles of the hand. It consists of a central and two lateral portions. The ceMlral portion occupies the middle of the palm, is triangular in shape, of great strength and thickness, and binds down the tendons and protects the vessels and nerves in this situation. It is narrow above, where it is attached to the lower margin of the annular ligament, and receives the expanded tendon of the Palmaris longus muscle. Below, it is broad and exijanded, and divides into four slips, one for each finger. Each slip gives off superficial fibres, which are inserted into the skin of the palm and finger, those to the Pig. 530.â€”Palmar fascia.

The deeper part of each sHp subdivides into two processes, which are inserted into the fibrous sheaths which confine tlu' Flexor tendons. From the sides of these processes offsets are sent backwards, to be attached to the transverse metacarpal ligament. By this arrangement short channels are formed on the front of the lower ends of the metacarpal bones, through which the Flexor tendons pass. Between the two processes into which each slip divides is attached the digital sheath. Ihe interval.- left between the four fibrous slips transmit the digital vessels and nerves, and the tendons of the Lumbricales. At the points of division ot the

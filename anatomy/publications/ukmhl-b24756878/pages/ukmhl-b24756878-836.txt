NEUROLOGY 818 (p. 806), the fibres of which are derived from the cells of the grey matter of the opposite side of the spinal cord. , , The base of the posterior horn at first lies on the dorsal aspect of the central cTnal but when the latter opens into the fourth ventricle it appears Tthe aSral pu-t of the floor of that cavity. It forms the nuclei of termmation of tl^^ sensory fibres of the vagus and glosso-pharyngeal, and is associated wi h ?L veSuS part of the auditory nerve and the sensory root of the seventh ne?ve (pars St^^^^^^ of Wrisberg). Still higher, it forms a mass of m^^^ f Sls-?he locus cruleus-m which some of the sensory fibi.s of l^e^fi^Oi ne^ve , . , ,.1, head of the posterior horn Fig. 697.—The cranial nerve nuclei schematically ^ contmuous centre, a.e not .-epre.ented.) Sot ol the ffith nerve largely terminate. The direct or ascendmg cerebellar tract leaves the lateral area of the medulla ; most of its fibres are carried backwards hito the restiform body of the same side, and through it are conveyed to the cerebellum; but some run upwards mth the fibres of the fiUet, and, reaching the inferior quadrigemmal bodies, undergo decussation, and are carried to the cere- bellum tlirough its superior peduncle. The basis bundles of the anterior and lateral columns largely consist of inter- segmental fibres, which hnk together the difierent seg- ments of the cord; they assist in forming the formatio reticularis of the medulla, and many of them are accu- mulated mto a strand which runs up close to the median raphe between the fillet and the floor of the fourth ven- tricle. This strand is named the dorsal or posterior longitu- dinal fasciculus, and wiU be again referred to.

MEMBRANES AND APPENDAGES OF THE EMBRYO 93 wall of the sac by the primitiA^e aortae, and after circulating through a wide-meshed capillary plexus, termed the vascular area, is returned by the vitelline veins to the tubular heart of the embryo. This constitutes the vitelline circulation, and by means Fig. 114.—Section through the embryo which is represented in fig. 109. (After Graf Spec.) of it nutritive material is absorbed from the yolk-sac and conveyed to the embryo. At the end of the fourth week the yolk-sac presents the appearance of a small pear-shaped vesicle opening into the alimentary canal by a long narrow tube, the vitelline duct. The vesicle may be seen at birth as a small sac near the placenta, but the duct is soon obliterated ; its proximal part, however, sometimes persists in the adult as a diverticulum from the small intestine. It is known as Meckel's diverticulum, is situated from two to four feet above the ileo- colic junction, and may be attached by a fibrous cord to the abdominal wall at the umbilicus. The amnion is a membranous sac which surrounds and protects the embryo. It is developed in reptiles, birds, and mammals, which are hence called 'Amniota '; but not in amphibia and fishes, which are consequently tenned ' Anamma.' In reptiles, birds, and many mam- mals it is developed in the following manner. At the point of constriction where the primitive alimentary canal of the embryo joins the yolk-sac— i.e. in the region of the future umbilicus—a reflection or folding upwards of the somatopleure takes place. This, the amniotic fold (fig. 116), first makes its appearance at the cephalic extremity, and subsequently at the caudal end and sides of the embryo, and gradually rising more and more, its different parts meet and fuse over the dorsal aspect of the embryo, and enclose a cavity, the amniotic Fig. 116.—Human embryo from thirty-one to thu-ty-four days.

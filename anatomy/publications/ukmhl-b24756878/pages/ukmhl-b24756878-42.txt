The stratiform fibro- carlilages are those which form a thin coating to osseous grooves through which the tendons of certain muscles ghde. Small masses of fibro- cartilage are also developed in the tendons of some muscles, where they glide over bones, as in the ten- dons of thePeroneuslongus and Tibialis posticus. Yellow or elastic fibro- cartilage is found in the human body in the auricles nf the external cars the Eustachian tubes, the cornicula laryngis, and the • Wtif Trconsists of cartila-e-ceUs and a matrix, the latter being pervaded bfa n1S.i of V ow^ anastomosing in all directi^. eJcSpttmediately around each cell where there is ^^--^J ^/^^^^^^^^ ^^ni:l£j£fiS — " is that it yields on l^h^ vrS^ -ar?^ a mix5ii" of g^Lin^ShTucin^^ substances, chief among which, perhaps, is a compound termed chondro-mucoid.

636 ANGIOLOGY The meningeal branches consist of several small vessels, which supply the dura mater. One, the fodcrior memncjeal (a. meningea posterior), enters the cranium through the jugular foramen ; a second passes through the fonimeii lacerum medium; and occasionally a third through the anterior condyloid foramen. Applied Anatomy—The ascending pharyngeal artery has been wounded from the throat; as in the case in which the stem of a tobacco-pipe was driven mto the vessel, causing fatal hoomorrhage. 7. The superficial temporal artery (a. temporalis superficialis) (fig. 576), the smaller of the two terminal branches of the external carotid, appears, fi'om its direction, to be the continuation of that vessel. It commences in the substance of the parotid gland, behind the neck of the mandible and crosses over the posterior root of the zygoma. It then passes beneath the Attrahens auriculam muscle, lying on the temporal fascia, and divides, about two inches above the zygomatic arch, into two branches, an anterior and a posterior temporal. , , , . , • i Relations.—As it crosses the zygoma, it is covered by the Attrahens auriculam muscle and by a dense fascia : it is crossed by the temporo-facial division of the facial nerve and one or two veins, and is accompanied by the auriculo-temporal nerve, which lies behind it. j-. , • ■ i- Besides some twigs to the parotid gland, to the temporo-mandibular ]omt, and to the Masseter muscle, its branches are : Transverse facial. Anterior auricular. Middle temporal. Anterior temporal. Posterior temporal. The transverse facial (a. transversa faciei) is given ofE from the superficial temporal before that vessel quits the parotid gland ; running f^^^^'f .^f "^^^ the substance of the gland, it passes transversely across the side o face between Stenson's duct and the lower border of the zygoma, and dn ides into numerous branches, which supply the parotid gland, the Masseter muscle, and he integument, and anastomose with the facial, masseteric and ^^f^^-^^^'itf This vessel rests on the Masseter, and is accompamed by one or two branches of the facial nerve.

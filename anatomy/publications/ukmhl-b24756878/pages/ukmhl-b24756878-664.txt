646 ANGIOLOGY Branches.—The cervical portion of the internal carotid gives off no branches. Those from the other portions are : jTympanic (internal or deep). I Vidian. Arteriae receptaculi. Pituitary. - Gasserian. Anterior meningeal. ,Ophthalmic. Aiiterior cerebral. Middle cerebral. Posterior communicating. Anterior choroidal. 1. The tympanic (ramus caroticotympanicus) is a small branch which enters the cavity of the tympanum, through a minute foramen in the carotid canal, and From the Petrous portion From the Cavernous portion From the Cerebral portion anastomoses with the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary, and with the stylo-mastoid artery. i wi„v;j;,„ 2 The Vidian is a small, inconstant branch which passes through the \ idian canai and anastomoses with the Vidian branch of the mternal maxillary artery. 3 The arterise receptaculi are numerous small vessels which supply tiie pituitary body, the Gasserian ganglion, and the walls of the cavernous and inferior petrosal sinuses. Some of them anastomose with branches of the middle mcmngeal. 4. The pituitary branches are one or two minute vessels supplying tnc pituitary body. , , ^ • r 5. The Gasserian branches are small vessels to the Gasserian ganghon. 6 The anterior meningeal is a small branch which passes over the lesser wing of the sphenoid to supply the dura mater of the anterior cranial fossa ; it anastomoses with the meningeal branch from the posterior ethmoidal artery.

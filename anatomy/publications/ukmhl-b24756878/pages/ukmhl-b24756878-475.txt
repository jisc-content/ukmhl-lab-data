It consists of two muscular beUies, connected by an i interveninc' tendinous aponeurosis, the epicranial aponeurosis. The occipital mrlion (m°occipitalis) is thin, quadi-ilateral in form, and about an inch and : a Iialf in length ; it arises from the outer two-thirds of the superior curved ' line of the occipital bone, and from the mastoid portion of the temporal.

Tlie frontal portion (m. frontalis) is thin, of a quadrilateral form, and intimately adherent to the superficial fascia. It is broader, and its fibres are longer and paler in colour than those of the occipital portion. It has no bony attachments. Its internal fibres are continuous with those of the Pyramidahs nasi. Its middle fibres become blended with the Cori'ugator supercilii and Orbicularis palpebrarum ; and the outer fibres are also blended with the latter muscle

136 EMBRYOLOGY aspect of the fore-gut, and the original relation of the somatopleuie and splauchno- pleiire layers of the pericardial area is reversed, the latter being placed on the dorsal aspect of the former. Each primitive aorta now consists of a ventral and a dorsal part connected anteriorly by an arch. These three parts are named respectively the anterior ventral aorta, the dorsal aorta, and the first cephaUc arch. The first cephaUc arches pass through the mandibular arches, and behind them five additional pairs subsequently develop, so that in all six pairs of aortic arches are formed. The vitelline veins which enter the embryo through the anterior wall of the umbiUcal orifice are now continuous with the posterior ends of the anterior ventral aortte. With the formation of the tail-fold the posterior parts of the primitive aortfe are carried forward in a ventral direction to form the posterior ventral aortse and primary caudal arches.* In the pericardial region the two primitive aortffi grow together, and fuse to form a single tubular heart (fig. 180), the posterior end of which receives the two vitelUne veins, while from its anterior end the two anterior ventral aortas emerge.f By the rhythmical contraction of the tubular heart the blood is forced through the aortse and blood- FiG. 179.—Human embryo of about fourteen days old with yolk-sac.

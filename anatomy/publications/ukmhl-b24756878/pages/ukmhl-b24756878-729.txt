FEMORAL ARTERY 711 glands, the superficial circumflex iliac vein, the iliac portion of the fascia lata and the anterior part of the femoral sheath. The genital branch of the genito-crural nerve courses for a short distance within the outer compartment of the femoral sheath, and lies at first in front and then on the outer side of the artery. Near the apex of Scarpa's triangle the internal cutaneous nerve crosses the artery from without inwards. Fig. 618.â€”The femoral artery. Behind the artery are the posterior part of the femoral sheath, the pubic portion of the fascia lata, the inner part of the tendon of the Psoas, the Pectineus and the Adductor longus. The artery is separated from the capsule of the hip-joint by the tendon of the Psoas, from the Pectineus by the femoral vein and profunda vessels, and from the Adductor longus by the femoral vein. The nerve to the Pectineus passes inwards behind the artery. On the outer side of the artery, but separated

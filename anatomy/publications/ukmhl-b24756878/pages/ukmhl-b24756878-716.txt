ANGIOLOGY 698 lateral sacral with the middle sacral artery ; of the epigastric with the internal mammary, inferior intercostal, and lumbar arteries ; of the circumflex Uiac with the lumbar arteries ; of the ilio-lumbar with the last lumbar artery ; of the obturator artery, by means of its pubic branch, with the vessel of the opposite side and with the deep epigastric. Internal Iliac Artery (fig. 608) The internal iliac or hypogastric artery (a. hypogastrica) supplies the walls and viscera of the pelvis, the buttock, the generative organs, and the inner side of the thigh. It is a short, thick veseal, smaller than the external iliac, and about an inch and a half in length. It arises at the bifurcation of the common iliac, opposite the lumbo-sacral articulation, and, passing downwards to the upper margin of the great sacro-sciatic foramen, divides into two large trunks, an anterior and a posterior. Relations.—It is in relation in front with the ureter, which separates it from the peritoneum ; behind, with the internal ihac vein, the lumbo-sacral cord, and the Pyriformis muscle ; on its outer side, near its origin, with the external ihac vein, which hes between it and the Psoas magnus muscle ; lower down, with the obturator nerve. In the foetus, the internal iliac or hypogastric artery is twice as large as the external iliac, and is the direct continuation of the common iliac. It ascends along the side of the bladder, and runs upwards on the back of the anterior wall of the abdomen to the umbilicus, converging towards its fellow of the opposite side. Having passed through the umbilical opening, the two arteries, now termed umbilical, enter the umbilical cord, where they are coiled round the umbilical vein, and ultimately ramify in the placenta. At birth, when the placental circulation ceases, the pelvic portion only of the hypogastric artery remains patent and constitutes the internal iliac artery and the first part of the superior vesical artery of the adult ; the remainder of the vessel is converted into a solid fibrous cord, the obliterated hypogastric artery (ligamentum umbilicale laterale), which extends from the pelvis to the umbilicus. Peculiarities as regards length.—In two-thirds of a large number of cases, the length of the internal ihac varied between an inch and an inch and a half ; in the remainmg third it was more frequently longer than shorter, the maximum length bemg three mclies, the minimum, half an inch. . t- + The lengths of the common and mternal iUac arteries bear an mverse proportion to each other, the mternal iUac artery bomg long when the common iliac is short, and vice ^^'^^As regards its place of division.—The place of division of the mternal iliac varies between the upper margin of the sacrum and the upper border of the sacro-sciatic foramen. The right and left internal ihac arteries m a series of cases often differed m lengtn, but neither seemed constantly to exceed the other. , . , , ... , , „ k„ Applied Anatomy.-The apphcation of a Ugature to the mternal ihac artery may be required in cases of aneurysm or haemorrhage affectmg one of its branches. The vessel mav be best secured by an abdommal section in the median hue and reaclung the ^ e^sel through the peritoneal cavity. It should be remembered that the vem hes l^ehmd and on the right side, a httle external to the artery, and in close contact with it, t^e uretei which lie! in fro^t, must also be avoided. The degree of facihty in applying a h^gature to this vessel will mainly depend upon its length It has been seen f^^'^^^^^^^^^ majority of the cases examined, the artery was short, varying from an ^"^^^ f ^"^^"^I^ and a half ; in these cases, the artery is deeply seated m the pelvis : ^^Z^^"^'"'^^^^^Xlt the vessel is longer, it is found partly above that cavity. If the '^^[ery be cry short, a. occasionaUy happens, it would be preferable to apply a ligature to the common iLac.

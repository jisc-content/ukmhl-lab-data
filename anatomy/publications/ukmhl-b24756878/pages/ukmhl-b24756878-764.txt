746 ANGIOLOGY receiving tributaries from both surfaces. Below tlie front of the elbow it gives off the vena mediana cubiii, which passes across to join the basilic. It then ascends in front of the elbow in the groove betw-een the Brachio-radialLs and the Biceps. It crosses superficial to the musculo-cutaneous nerve and ascends in the groove along the outer border of the Biceps. In the upper third of the arm it passes between the Pectoralis major and the Deltoid, where it is accom- panied by the descending or humoral branch of the acromio-thoracic artery. It pierces the costo-coracoid membrane and, crossmg the axillary artery, ends in the axillary vein just below the clavicle. The accessory cephalic vein (v. cephalica accessoria) arises either from a small tributary plexus on the back of the forearm or from the ulnar side of the dorsal venous arch ; it joins the cephalic below the elbow. In some cases the accessory cephalic springs from the cephalic above the Avrist and joins it agam higher up. A large oblique branch frequently connects the basilic and cephahc veins on the back of the forearm. j r The basilic vein (v. basilica) (fig. 638) beghis in the ulnar end of the dorsal venous arch. It runs up the posterior surface of the ulnar side of the forearm and inclines forw^ard to the anterior surface below the elbow, where it is joined by the vena mediana cubiti. It ascends «bUquely in the groove between the Biceps and Pronator teres across the brachial artery, from which it is separatedby the bicipital fascia; filaments of the internal cutaneous nerve pass both in front of and behind this portion of the vein. It then runs upwards along the inner side of the Biceps, perforates the deep fascia a little below the middle of the arm and, ascending on the inner side of the brachial artery to the lower border of the Teres major, is contmued onwards as the axii ary vein The median vein (v. mediana antibrachii) drams the plexus on the pahnar surface of the hand. It ascends on the ulnar side of the front of f^J^^^^ and ends in the basiUc vein or m the vena mediana cubiti; in a small P^oP^^f of cases it divides into two branches, one of which ]oms the basihc, the other the cephalic, below the elbow.* Applied Anatomy-Venesection is generaUy performed at the bend of ^l^ow and as a matter of practice the largest vein in this situation is commonly se ected Thu, is : uauTSe vlrr^ediana cubi'ti (median basiUc) and there -^f^^^^^^^^l^^^ and disadvantages in selecting this vem.

218 OSTEOLOGY The Parietal Bones The parietal bones (ossa parietales) form, by their union, the sides and roof of the skull. Each is irregularly quadrilateral in form, and presents for examination two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. The- external surface (fig. 288) is convex, smooth, and marked about its centre by an eminence, the parietal eminence (tuber parietale), which indicates the point where ossification commenced. Crossing the middle of the bone in an arched direction are two curved lines, the superior and inferior temporal lines (linese temporales); the former gives attachment to the temporal fascia, while the latter indicates the upper limit of the muscular origin of the Temporal muscle. Above these lines the bone is covered by the aponeurosis of the Occipito-frontalis; below them it forms part of "the temporal fossa, and FiQ. 288.â€”Left parietal bone. External surface. affords attachment to the Temporal muscle. At the back part of the superior border, close to the sagittal suture, is the parietal forajnen (foramen parietale). which transmits a vein to the superior longitudinal sinus, and sometimes a small branch of the occipital artery. It is not constantly present, and its size varies considerably. The internal surface (fig. 289) is concave ; it presents depressions corre- sponding to the cerebral convolutions, and numerous furrows for the ramifi- cations of the middle meningeal artery ; the latter run upwards and back wards from the antero-inferior angle, and from the central and posterior part of the lower border. Along the upper margin is a shallow groove, which, together with that on the opposite parietal, forms a cliannel (sulcus sagittalis) for the superior longitudinal sinus ; the edges of the sulcus afford attach- ment to the falx cerebri. Near the groove arc seen several depressions, best marked in the skulls of old persons, for the Pacchionian bodies. The internal opening of the parietal foramen is also seen when that aperture exists.

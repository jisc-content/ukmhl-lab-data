158 EMBRYOLOGY the abdominal cavity into the umbilical cord, but by the end of the third month it is withdrawn within the cavity. With the lengthening of the tube, the mesoderm, which attaches it to the future vertebral column and carries the blood-vessels for the supply of the gut, is thinned and drawn out to form the posterior common mesentery. The portion of this mesentery attached to the greater curvature of the stomach is named the dorsal mesogaslrium, and the part which suspends the colon is termed the mesocolon (fig. 211). About the sixth week a lateral diver- ticulum makes its appearance a short distance behind the opening of the vitelline duct, and indicates the future ctecum and appendix. The part of the loop on the distal side of the csecal diverticulum increases in diameter and forms the future ascending and transverse portions of the large intestine. Until the third month the cffical diverticulum has a uniform calibre, but from this time onwards its most dependent part remains rudimentary and forms the vermiform appendix, while its upper part expands to form the c^cum. Changes also take place in the shape and position of the stomach.

510 MYOLOGY transversalis fascia at a point called the internal abdominal ring. This opening is not visible externally since the transversalis fascia is prolonged on these structures as the infundibuliform fascia. The internal or deep abdominal ring (annulus inguinalis abdominalis) is situated in the transversalis fascia, midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis, and about half an inch above i'oupart's ligament (fig. 510). It is of an oval form, the long axis of the oval being vertical; it varies in size in different subjects, and is much larger in the male than in the female. It is bounded, above and externally, by the arched fibres of the Transversalis ; below and internally, by the deep epigastric vessels. It transmits the spermatic cord in the male and the round ligament in the female. From its circumference a thin funnel-shaped membrane, the infundihuliform fascia, is continued round the cord and testis, enclosing them in a distmct covering. Extra-peritoneal connective tissue. — Between the inner surface of the general layer of the fascia which lines the interior of the abdominal and pelvic cavities, and the peritoneum, there is a considerable amount of connective tissue, termed the extra-peritoneal or subperitoneal connective The parietal portion lines the cavity in varying quantities in different situations. It is especially abundant on the posterior wall of the abdomen, and particularly around the kidneys, where it contains much fat. On the anterior wall of the abdomen, except in the pubic region, and on the roof of the abdomen, it is scanty, and here the transversalis fascia is more closely connected with the peritoneum. There is a considerable amount of extra- peritoneal connective tissue in the pelvis. The visceral portion follows the course of the. branches of the abdommai aorta between the layers of the mesenteries and other folds of peritoneum which connect the various viscera to the abdominal wall, and assist m fixing them. The two portions are directly contmuous with each other. The deep crural arch.—Curving over the external ihac vessels, just at the point where they become femoral, on the abdominal side of Poupart's ligament and loosely connected with it, is a thickened band of fibres called the deep crural arch. It is apparently a thickening of the fascia transversalis, jomed externally to the centre of the lower margin of Poupart s ligament and arching across the front of the crui'al sheath to be inserted by a broad attach- ment into the spine of the pubis and ilio-pectmeal line, behmd the conjoined tendon. In some subjects this structure is not very prominently marked, and not infrequently it is altogether wanting. Surface Form.—The skin of the abdomen is thin and sensitive In the male it is often thickly hair-clad, especiaUy towards the lower part of the middle Ime. In the female, the hairs are confined to the pubes. After distension from pregnancy or other causes, the skin commonly presents transverse white hnes, which are quite smooth, being destitute of papilla. These are known as strim gravidarum. ., ,, • ^ t The only muscles of the abdomen which have any considerable mfluence on surface form are the External oblique and Rectus. With regard to the External f ^ue, the up^r dieitations of its origin from the ribs are well marked m a muscular subject, SdicSSg with those of the Serratus magnus ; the lower digitations ai-e not visible being covered by the thick border of the Latissimus dorsi. It« attachment to he crest of the mum m conjunction with the Internal oblique, forms a t nek obhque roll which dLSm Ls tCiliac hu-row. Sometimes on the front of the latera -g-n of the abdomen an undulating outhne marks the spot where the muscular fibres termmate and tl c apo- nLScoinces.

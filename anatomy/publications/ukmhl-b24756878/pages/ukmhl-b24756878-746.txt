ANGIOLOGY 728 THE SYSTEMIC VEINS The systemic veins may be arranged into three groups : 1. The cardiac veins. 2. The veins of the head and neck, upper extremity, and thorax, wliicli termiiiate in the superior vena cava. 3. The veins of the lower extremity, abdomen, and pelvis, which terminate in the inferior vena cava. CARDIAC VEINS The coronary sinus (sinus coronarius) is a wide venous channel about an mch in length which receives the majority of the veins draining the blood from the substance of the heart. It is situated m the posterior part ot the auriculo-ventricular groove, and is covered by muscular fibres from the lett auricle. It terminates in the right auricle between the opening of the mfenor vena cava and the auriculo-ventricular aperture, its orifice being guarded by a semilunar valve, the wZw. o/T/^efeestMS. . Its tributaries are the great, small, and middle cardiac vems, the posterior vein of the left ventricle, and the oblique vem of MarshaU, all of which, except the last, are provided with valves at then- orifices.

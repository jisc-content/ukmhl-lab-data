Superim- angle Inferior angle posterior occipito-atlantal ligament is attached around the postero-lateral part of the foramen magnum, just outside the margin of the foramen. The internal surface is deeply concave and divided into four fossai by a crucial ridge, the eminentia cruciaia. The upper Uvo fossae are triangular and lodge the occipital lobes of the cerebrum ; the lower two are quadi-ilateral a.nd accommodate the hemispheres of the cerebellum. At the point of intersection of the four divisions of the crucial ridge is the internal occipital protuberance (protuberantia occipitaUs interna). From tliis eminence the upper division of the ridge runs to the superior angle of the bone, and on one side of it (generally the right) is a deep groove, the sulcus sagittalis, which lodges the hinder part of the superior longitudinal sinus ; to the margins of this sulcus the falx cerebri is attached. The lower division of the crucial ridge is prominent, and is named

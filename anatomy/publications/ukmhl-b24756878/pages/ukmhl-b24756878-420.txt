402 SYNDESMOLOGY which interlace with the aponeuroses of the Trapezius and Deltoid ; below, it is in contact with tlie intcrarticular fibro-cartilage wlien this is present. Tlie Inferior Acromio-clavicular Ligament (lig. acromioclaviculare inf.) is somewhat thinner tlian the preceding ; it covers the under part of the articu- lation and is attaclied to the adjoining surfaces of the two bones. It is m relation, above, in rare cases with the intcrarticular fibro-cartilage ; below, with the tendon of the Supraspinatus. _ The Intcrarticular Fibro-cartilage (discus articulans) is frequently absent in this articulation. When it exists, it generally only partiaUy separates the articular surfaces, and occupies the upper part of the articulation. More rarely it completely separates the joint into two cavities. The Synovial Membrane.—Tliere is usually only one synovial membrane in this articulation, but when a complete intcrarticular fibro-cartilage exists, there are two.

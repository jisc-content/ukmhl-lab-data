323 OS INNOMINATUM posterior sacro-iliao ligaments and for the origins of the Erector and Multifidus spinffi. The crest of the ilium (crista iliaca) is convex in its general outline but is sinuously curved, being concave inwards in front, concave outwards behind. It is thinner at the centre than at the extremities, and terminates in the anterior and posterior superior iliac spines. The surface of the crest is broad, and divided into an external lip, an internal lip, and an intermediate space. About two inches beliind the anterior superior iliac spine there is a prominent tubercle on the outer lip. To the external lip (labium externum) are attached the Tensor fasciae femoris, Obhquus externus abdominis, and Latissimus dorsi, and along its whole length the fascia lata ; to the space between the lips (linea intermedia) the Internal oblique; to the internal lip (labium internum), the fascia iliaca, the Transversalis abdominis, Quadratus lumborum. Erector spinte, and Iliacus. The anterior border of the ilium is concave. It presents two projections, separated by a notch. Of these, the uppermost, situated at the junction of the crest and anterior border, is called the anterior superior iliac spine (spina ihaca anterior superior) ; its outer border gives attachment to the fascia lata, and the Tensor fasciae femoris ; its inner border, to the Ihacus ; while its extremity affords attachment to Poupart's ligament and gives origin to the Sartorius. Beneatli tliis eminence is a notch which gives origin to the Sartorius, and across which the external cutaneous nerve passes. Below the notch is the anterior inferior iliac spine (spina iliaca anterior inferior), whicli ends m the upper hp of the acetabulum ; it gives attachment to the straight tendon of the fiegtus fftmnris and to the ilin-femnral hfx^-m^^t of the hip-jnhit. On the mner side of the anterior inferior spine is a broad, shallow groove, over whicli the Iho-psoas passes. This groove is bounded internally by an eminence, the tho-pectineal, which marks the point of union of the ilium and pubis. The posterior border of the ilium, shorter tlian the anterior, also presents two projections separated by a notch, the posterior superior iliac spine (spina Iliaca posterior superior) and the posterior inferior iliac spine (spina iliaca posterior inferior). The former corresponds with that portion of the inner surface of the ilium M-hich serves for the attachment of the obHque portion of the sacro-iliac ligaments and the Multifidus spina;; the latter to the lower extremity of the auricular surface. Below tlie posterior inferior spine is a aeep notch, the great sacro-sciatic notch (incisura iscliiadica major) J lie Ischium (os ischii) forms the lower and back part of the os innomi- natum. It is divisible into a tliick and soUd portion, the body : a large rough eminence, on which the trunk rests in sitting, the tuberosity; and a thin part, which passes forwards and slightly upwards, the ramus. Ihe body (corjDusoss.iscliii), somewhat triangular in form, presents three sui-faces, external, internal, and posterior; and three borders, external, internal, and posterior.

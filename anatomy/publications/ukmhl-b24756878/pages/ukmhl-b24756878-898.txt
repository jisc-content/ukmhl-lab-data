NEUROLOGY 880 Structure of the Cerebral Cortex (fig. 748) The cerebral cortex differs in its thickness and in its minute structure in different parts of the hemisphere. For instance, it is thmner m the occipital reaion than in the pre- and postcentral gyri, and it is also much thinner at the bottom of the sulci than on the top of the convolutions. Again, the minute structure of the precentral differs from that of the postcentral gyrus, and areas Fig 748.-Cerebral cortex. (Poirier.)

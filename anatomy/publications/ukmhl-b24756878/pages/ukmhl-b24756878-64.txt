The variation in diameter of the nerve-fibres (from x^^ts «> ^wtso^oi an inch) depends mainly upon the amount of the white substance, though the axis cyhnder also varies ^athin certain Umits. The medullary sheath does not always form a continuous sheath to the axis cyhnder, but uiidei- goes interruptions in its continuity at Regular intervals, giving to the fibre the appearance of constriction at these pdnts. These were first described by Sanvier and are kno\vii as the nodes of IS (fig. 61). The portion o nerv- fibre between two nodes is called an Zernodal segment.

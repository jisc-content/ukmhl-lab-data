MUSCLES AND FASCLE OF THE UROGENITAL REGION 523 l)oiut at the coccyx, it helps to fix the central point of the perinajum, so that the Accelerator urinse may act from this fixed point. The Sphincter ani internus is a muscular ring which surrounds the anal canal for about an inch ; its inferior border being contiguous with, but quite separate from, the External sphincter. Tiiis muscle is about a sixth of an inch in thickness, and is formed by an aggregation of the involuntary circular fibres of the intestine. Its lower border"is about a quarter of an inch from the external orifice. It is paler in colour and less coarse in texture than the External sphincter. Actions.—Its action is entirely involuntary. It helps the External sphincter to occlude the anal aperture. 2. A. Muscles and Fascia of the Urogenital Region in the Male (figs. 514, 515) Transversus perinaji. Erector penis. Accelerator urinse. Compressor urethras. Superficial fascia.—The superficial fascia of this region consists of two layers, superficial and deep. The superficial layer is thick, loose, areolar in texture, and contains in its meshes much adipose tissue, the amount of which varies in different subjects. In front, it is continuous with the dartos of the scrotum ; behind, it is continuous with the subcutaneous areolar tissue surrounding the anus ; and. Fig. 514.—The perinsBum. The integument and superficial layer of superficial fascia reflected. on either side, with the same fascia on the inner sides of the thighs. In the middle line, it is adherent to the skin of the raphe and to the deep layer of the superficial fascia. The deep layer of superficial fascia (fascia of CoUes) (fig. 514) is thin, aponeurotic in structure, and of considerable strength, serving to bind down the muscles of the root of the penis. It is continuous, in front, with tiie dartos of the scrotum, the deep fascia of the penis, the fascia of the spermatic

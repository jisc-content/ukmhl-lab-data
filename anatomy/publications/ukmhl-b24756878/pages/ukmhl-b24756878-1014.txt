The gangha are of small size, and placed much nearer the median line than are the thoracic ^^"&rey rami communicantes connect all the ganglia with the lumbar spinal nerves There may be two from each ganglion, but the arrangement is not so uniform as in other regions. The first and second, and sometimes the third, lumbar nerves send white rami communicantes to the upper two or three ganglia From the situation of the lumbar ganglia, these branches are longer than in the other regions. They accompany the lumbar arteries around the sides of the bodies of the vertebraj, passuig beneath the fibrous arches from which some of the fibres of the Psoas arise. ^ ■ r ^ c Of the branches of distribution, some pass inwards, m tront ot the aorta, and help to form the aortic plexus. Other branches descend m front of the common ihac arteries, and, joming over the promontory of tlie sacrum, assist m forming the hypogastric plexus. Numerous delicate filaments are also distributed to the bodies of the vertebrae, and the ligaments connectmg them. Pelvic Portion of the Gangliated Coed The pelvic portion of the gangUated cord (pars pelvina s. sympathici) is situated in front of the sacrum, along the mner side of the an erior sacra foramma. It consists of four or five small gangha (ganglia sacraha) on eithei Ide, comiected together by mterganglionic cords, ^^\;^°'''r'2\heT^^^^ the lumbar portion.

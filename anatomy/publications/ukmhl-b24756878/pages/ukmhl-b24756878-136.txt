118 EMBRYOLOGY on a level with the third lumbar vertebra, and in the adult it terminates at the lower border of the first or upper border of the second lumbar vertebra. A delicate filament, the /Hum terminale, extends from its lower end as far as the coccyx. The Spinal Nerves.—Each spinal nerve is attached to the cord by an anterior or ventral and a posterior or dorsal root. The fibres of the anterior roots are formed by the axons of the neuroblasts which lie in the ventral part of the mantle layer ; these axons grow out through the overlying marginal layer and become grouped to form the anterior nerve- roots (fig. 147). 11 j: . • , The fibres of the posterior roots are developed from the cells of the spinal ganglia. Before the neural groove is closed to form the neural tube a ridge of ectodermal cells, the ganglion ridge or neural crest (fig. 150), appears along the prominent margin of each medullary lamina. When the laminae meet in the middle line the two ganglion ridges fuse and form a wedge-shaped area along the line of closure of the tube. The cells of this, area proHferate rapidly opposite the primitive segments and then migrate in an outward and ventral direction to the sides of the neural tube, where they form a series of oval- shaped masses, the future spinal ganglia. These gangUa are arranged sym- metrically on the two sides of the neural tube and, except in the region of the tail are equal in number to the primitive segments. The cells of the ganglia are at fijst round or oval in Fig. 150.—Two stages in the development of the neui-al crest in the human embryo. (Lenhossek.) shape, but soon assume the form of spindles the extremities of which gradually elongate into central and peripheral processes. The central processes grow in- wards and, becoming connected with the neural tube, consti- tute the fibres of the posterior nerve-roots, wlule the peripheral processes grow outwards to mingle with the fibres of the ante'rior root in the spinal nerve. As development pro- ceeds the original bipolar form of the cells changes; the two processes become approximated until they ultimately arise from a single'stem in a T-shaped manner. Only in the ganglia of the auditory nerve is the bipolar form retained.

NEUROLOGY 848 numerous fibres (thalamo-cortical) take origin, and radiate to ahnost every part of tlie cerebral cortex. The fillet, together with the other longitudinal strands of the tegmentum,enters its ventral part: the bundle of Vicq d'Azyr, from the corpus albicans, ends in its anterior tubercle, while many of the fibres of the optic tract terminate in its posterior extremity. Tlie tlialamus also receives numerous fibres (cortico-thalamic) from the cells of the cerebral cortex The fibres which arise from the cells of the thalamus form four principal groups or stalks : (a) those of the anterior stalk pass through the anterior limb of the internal capsule to the frontal lol^e ; (b) the fibres of the posterior stalk or optic radiations arise in the pulvmar and are conveyed through the extreme posterior part of the internal capsule to tlie occipital lobe • (c) the fibres of the inferior stalk leave the under and mesial surfaces of the thalamus, and pass outwards beneath the lenticular nucleus to end in the temporal lobe and island of Reil; {d) those of the parietal stalk pass from the outer nucleus of the thalamus to the parietal lobe. Fibres also extend from the thalamus into the corpus striatum—those destined for the caudate j^Q, 720—Postero-lateral view of the hind- and mid-brains.

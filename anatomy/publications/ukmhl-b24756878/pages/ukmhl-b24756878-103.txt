85 SEGMENTATION OF THE FERTILISED OVUM The segmentation of the mammalian ovum may not take place in the regular sequence of two, four, eight, &c., since one of the two first-formed cells may sub- divide more rapidly than the other, giving rise to a three- or a five-cell stage. Fig. 101.—Ovum of the rabbit at the end of the process of segmentation. E ep. Primitive ectoderm, hy. Primitive entoderm. Zip. Plnce'wliere tlie ectoderm has not yet grown over tlie entoderm. (From Balfour, after Ed. van Beuedeu.) The cells of the morula are at first closely aggregated inside the zona pellucida ; but soon they become ari-anged into an outer or peripheral layer, the primitive ectoderm or trophoblast, which does not contribute to the formation of the embryo Fig. 102.—Blastodermic vesicle of Vespertilio murinus. (After van Beneden.) Inner cM-mass Entoderm Blaatodemiio vesicle Trophoblast proper, and an inner cell-mass, from which the embryo is developed (figs. 101, b, and 102). Fluid collects between the trophoblast and the greater part of the inner cell-mass, and thus the morula is converted into a vesicle, the blastodermic vesicle.

Inner cell-mass Tro2>hoblast The inner cell-mass remains in contact, however, with the trophoblast at one pole of the ovum ; this is named the embryonic pole, since it indicates the situation where the future embryo will be developed. The cells of the trophoblast become

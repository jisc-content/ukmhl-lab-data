189 THORACIC VERTEBRA are thicker and stronger in tliis and the next vertebra than in any other part of the thoracic region. The spinous process is short, and nearly horizontal in direction. The transverse processes are very short, tubercular at their extremities, and have no articular facets. The twelfth thoracic vertebra has the same general characteristics as the eleventh, but may be distinguished from it by its inferior articular processes beinf' convex and turned outw ards, like those of the lumbar vertebrae ; by Fig. 254.â€”Peculiar thoracic vertebrae. the general form of the body, laminae, and spinous process, in which it resembles the lumbar vertebra;; and by the transverse processes being subdivided into three elevations, the superior, inferior, and external tubercles; the superior and inferior correspond to the mamillaiy and accessory processes of the lumbar vertebrae. Traces of similar elevations are found on the transverse processes of the tenth and eleventh thoracic vertebrae.

745 VEINS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY Cephalic vein Both sets of vessels are provided with valves, which are more numerous in the deep than in the superficial. The superficial veins of the upper extremity 638.—The superBoial veins of the upper extremity. are. the Digital. Metacarpal. Cephalic. Basilic. Median. Digital veins.—The dorsal digital veins pass along the sides of the fingers and are joined to one another by oblique communicating branches. Those from the adjacent sides of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers unite to form three dorsal metacarpal veins (vv. metacarpete dorsales), which terminate in a dorsal venous arch (fig. 637) opposite the middle of the metacarpus. The arch is convex distally ; its radial extremity is joined by the dorsal digital vein from the radial side of the index finger and by the dorsal digital veins of the thumb, and is prolonged upwards as tlie cephalic vein. The ulnar extremity of the arcli receives the dorsal digital vein of the uhiar side of the little finger and is continued upwards as the basUic vein. A com- municating branch fre- quently connects the dorsal venous arch with the cephalic vein about the middle of the forearm. The palmar digital veins (vv. digitales volares) on each finger are connected to one another and to the dorsal digital veins by oblique vessels iy^'- intercapitulares). Ihey drain into a venous plexus which is situated over the tlienar andhypo- thenar eminences and ficross the front of the wrist. The cephalic vein (v dorsal Musculo- cutaneous nerve Accessory cephalic vein Cephalic vein Basilic vein Vena mediana cubiti Basilic vein Internal cuta- neous 7im've Median vein cephalica) (fig. 638) begins in tlie radial end of the venous arch and winds upwards round the radial border of the forearm,

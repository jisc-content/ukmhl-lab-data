It winds round the outer malleolus, and is distributed to tlic integument along the outer side of the foot and little toe, communicating on the dorsum of the foot with the musculo- cutaneous nerve. In the leg, its branches communicate with those of tlie small sciatic. The posterior tibial (fig. 813), the direct continuation of the internal popliteal nerve, commences at the lo« er Ijorder of the PopHteus muscle, and passes along the back part of the leg with the posterior tibial vessels to the interval between the inner malleolus and the heel, where it divides beneath the internal annular ligament of the ankle into the internal and external 2^lantar nerves. It lies upon the deep muscles of the leg, and is covered in tlie upper part by the muscles of the calf, lower doOTi by the skin and the super- ficial and deep fascise. In the upper part of its course, it hes to the inner side of the posterior tibial artery; but it soon crosses that vessel, and lies to its outer side as far as the ankle. In the lower third of the leg, it is placed parallel with the inner margm of the tendo AchUlis. The branches of the posterior tibial nerve are muscular, internal calcanean, and articular. The muscular branches arise either separately or by a common trunk from the upper part of the nerve. Tliey supply the Soleus. Tibialis posticus. Flexor longus digitorum, and Flexor lougu.< hallucis muscles ; the branch to the last nuiscle accompanies the peroneal artery. The brancli from the posterior tibial nerve to the Soleus entci-s the deep surface of the muscle, while that from the internal popliteal enters the superficial surface. The internal calcanean branch (ramus calcaneus medialis) per- forates the internal annular hgament, and suppUes tlie in- tegument of the heel and inner side of the sole of the foot. innniicans )icroiioi are not in Iheii * N.B.-In this diagram the coninninicans til>iali.s and com. _ ^ .urerficial muscles, normal position.

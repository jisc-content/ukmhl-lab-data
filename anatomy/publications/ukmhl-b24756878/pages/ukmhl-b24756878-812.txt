NEUEOLOGY mHE Nervous System is the most complicated and the most highly organised I of the various systems which make up the human body. It may be divided mto two parts, central and peripheral. The central nervous system consists of (a) an upper expanded portion the 6ra " contamed within the cranium, and (6) a lower, fonga ed nearly cy?mdrical portion, the svinal cord, lodged m the --tfral canal; the two portions are continuous with one another at the level of the upper border The^ peripheral nervous system consists of a series of nerves by which the cent?al nervous system is connected with the various tissues of the body. I^)r descript re purposes these nerves may be aiTanged in two groups, cerebra- ls;!^ :Sly^vlihl< the arrangement, however, ^emg an arb^tray^^^^^^^^^ the two eroups are intimately connected and closely mtermmgled. ihe ceieDro puSlnSv:?are forty-threJin number on -tl-side-tweW^^^^ to the brain, and thh-ty-one sfimil, to the spmal ; ^^^hey are ass^^^^^^ with the functions of the special and general ^^nses and w th the ^ o^^^^^ movements of the body.

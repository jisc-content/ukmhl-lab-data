Another is placed between the popliteal artery and the posterior ligament of the knee ; it receives the lymphatic vessels from the knee-jomt together with those wliich accompany the articular arteries. Tlie others lie at the sides of the popliteal vessels, and receive as alierents the trunks which accompany the anterior and posterior tibial vessels. The efferents of the popliteal glands pass almost entirely alongside the femoral vessels to the deep inguinal glands, but a few may accompany tlie internal saphenous vein, and end in the glands of the superficial inguinal group. The inguinal glands vary from twelve to twenty in number, and are arranged in two groups, superficial and deep. The superficial inguinal glands (fig. 658) lie in front of Scai-pa's triangle, and are situated between the two layers of the superficial fascia. They may be divided into two groups, an upper and a lower, by a horizontal line at the level of the termmation of the internal saphenous vein. The glands of the upper group (lymphoglandulse inguinales) form a chain immediately below Fia. 657.—Lymphatic glands of popliteal space.

68 HISTOLOGY parts The part beneath the body and root of the nail is called the matn^, because from it the nail is produced. Corresponding to the body of the nail, the matrix is thick, and raised into a series of longitudinal ridges whic^ arc very vascular, and the colour is seen through the transparent tissue. Behind this near the root of the nail, there are papilte which are small, less vascular, and have no regular arrangement, and here the tissue of the nail is somewhat more opaque ; hence this portion is of a whiter colour, and is called the lunula on account of its shape. . , ^ , . ^ £ ;^ The cuticle as it passes forwards on the dorsal surface of the hnger oi toe is attached to the sui'face of the nail a httle in advance of its root; at the extremity of the finger it is connected with the under surface of the nail a httle behind its free ed^e. The cuticle and horny substance of the nail (both epidermic structures) are thSs directly continuous with each other. The nails consist of a greatly thickened stratum lucidum, the stratum corneum forming merely the thin cuticular fold {eponychium) which overlaps the lunula. The ceUs have a laminated arrange- ment and are essentially similar to those composing the epidermis. The cells ot ^e deepest layer, which lie in contact with the papilla o the matrix, are columnar in form and arranged perpendicularly to the suiiace ; those which Bucceed them are of a rounded or polygonal form, the more superficial ones becoming broad, ?Sn and flattened, and so closely packed as to make the hmits of ea^h -U v^^^^^^ indistinct. It is by the successive growth of new ceUs at the root and under surface o the body of the nail that it advances forwards and mamtains a due SSss wMe, J the same time, the growth of the nad m the P-P- dirftion is secured.

1097 THE TEETH The ivory, or denline (substantia ebiu-aea) (fig. 907), foruis the principal mass of a tooth • in its central part is the cavity enclosing the pulp. It is a modification of osseous tissue' from which it differs, however, in structure. On microscopic examination it is seen to consist of a number of minute wavy and brandling tubes, the dentinal tubules, "imbedded in a dense homogeneous substance, the matrix. The dentinal tubules (canaliculi dentales) (fig. 908) are placed parallel with one another, and open at thek inner ends into the pulp cavity. In their course to the periphery they present two or three curves, and are twisted on themselves in a spu-al direction, ihese tubes vary in direction : thus in a tooth of the mandible they are vertical in the upper portion of the crown, becoming oblique and then horizontal in the neck and upper part Fig. 905.—Vertical section of a tooth in situ. Fia. 906.—Vertical section of a (15 diameters.) " molar tooth. of the root, wliile towards the lower part of the root they are inclined downwards. In theu- course they divide and subdivide dichotomously, so as to give to the cut surface of the dentine a striated appearance. From the sides of the tubes, especially in the fang, ramifications of extreme minuteness are given off, which join together in loo]3S in the matrix, or terminate in small dilatations, from which branches are given off". Near the jjeriphery ot the dentine, the finer ramifications of the tubules terminate imperceptibly by free ends. The dentinal tubules have comparatively thick walls, consisting, in addition to the intertubular tissue, of an elastic homogeneous membrane, the dentinal sheath of Nexmuinn, which resists the action ot acids ; they contain slender cylindrical prolongations of the odontoblasts, first described by Tomes, and named Tomes's fibres or dentinal fibres.

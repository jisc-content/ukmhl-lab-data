796 NEUROLOGY border of the second sacral vertebra. The dura mater is separated from the wall of the vei-tebral canal by a quantity of loose areolar tissue and a plexus of veins while between it and the subjacent arachnoid membrane is a capiUary' interval, the subdural space, winch contains a small q^^^ntity of fluid probably of the nature of lymph. The arachnoid membrane is a thm Sparent sheath, separated from the pia mater by a comparatively ^^ ide nteX the subaracJmoid space, which is filled w.th cerebro-spinal fluid, ihe p a naiV closely invests the cord and sends delicate septa into its substance ; a Fig. 672.—Sagittal section of spinal canal to show the lower end of the spinal cord and the filum terminale. (Testut.) Fig G73.—Cauda equina and filum terminale seen from behind. The dura mater has been opened and spread out, and the arachnoid membrane has been removed.

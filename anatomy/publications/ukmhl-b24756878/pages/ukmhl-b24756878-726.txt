The sheath assumes the form of a short funnol-sha])ecl tube, tlio wide end of which is directed upwards, while tlie lower, narrow end fuses with the fascial investment of the vessels, about an inch and a half below the level of Poupart's ligament. It is strengthened in front by a band termed the deep crural arch (p. 516). The outer wall of tlie sheath is vertical and is jierforated by the genital branch of the genito-crural nerve ; the inner wall is directed obUquely downwards and outwards and is pierced by the internal saphenous vein and by some lymphatic vessels. The sheath is divided by two vertical partitions wliich stretch between its anterior and posterior walls. The outermost compartment contains the femoral artery and the middle the femoral vein, while the innermost and smallest compartment is named the crural canal, and contains some lymphatic vessels and a lymphatic Fig. 614.â€”Femoral sheath laid opon to show its three compartments. aland imbedded in a small amount of areolar tissue The crural canal i.-, ScalTnd meiures about half an inch in length.

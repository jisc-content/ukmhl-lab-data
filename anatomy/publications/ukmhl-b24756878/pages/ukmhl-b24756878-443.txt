HIP-JOINT 425 not infrequentl}' comnumicates by a circular aperture with the cavity of the joint. It differs from tlie capsular ligament of tiie shoulder in being much less loose and lax, and in not being perforated for the passage of a tendon. The Ilio-femoral Ligament (figs. 462 and 467) is a band of great strength which lies ha front of tlie joint; it is intimately connected with the capsular ligament, and serves to strengthen it in this situation. It is attached, above, to the lower part of the anterior mferior spine of the ilium ; and, di\ading below, forms two bands, of which one passes downwards to be inserted into the lower part of the anterior mtertrochanteric line ; the other passes down- wards and outwards to be inserted into the upper part of tlie same line. Between the two bands is a thinner part of the capsule. In some joints there is no division, and the ligament spreads out into, a flat triangular band which is attached below into the whole length of the anterior intertrochanteric line. This ligament is frequently called the Y-shaped ligament of Bigelow ; and the outer or upper of the two bands is sometimes described as a separate ligament, under the name of the ilio-trochanteric ligament.

EMBRYOLOGY 174 Fro. 238.—Tail end of human embryo of twenty-five to twenty-nine days old. (From model by Keibel.) Miillerian duct Allantois \ Kidney diverticulum Umbilical cord In the female there is also a gubernaculum, which effects a considerable change in the position of the ovary, though not so extensive a change as in that of the testis in the male The gubeniaculum in the female, as it hes on either side m contact with the fundus of the uterus, contracts adhesions to this organ, and thus the ovarv is prevented from descending below this level. The upper part of the gubernaculum, i.e. the part between the ovary and the uterus, becomes ultimately the round ligament of the ovary, while the lower part, i.e. the part between the attachment of the cord to the uterus and its termination in the labium majus, ultimately forms the round ligament of the uterus. A pouch of peritoneum analogous to the processus vaginalis in the male accompanies it along the in- guinal canal: it is called the canal of Nuck. In rare cases the gubernaculum may fail to contract adhesions to the uterus, and then the ovary descends through the inguinal canal into the labium majus, extending down the canal of Nuck, and under these circumstances its position resembles that of the testis in the male. The Metanephros or Permanent Kidney.—The rudiments of the permanent kidneys make their appearance about the end of the first or beginning of the second month. Each arises as a diverticulum from the hmd-end of the VN olfliau duct close to where the latter opens into the cloaca (figs. 238,239). This diverti- culum grows upwards and forwards into the posterior part of the intermediate cell-mass, where its bhnd or anterior extremity becomes dilated and subsequently divides into several buds, which Umbilical vessels Kind-giit XowcUovd Fig. 239.—Tail end of human embryo of thirty- two to thirty-three days old. (From model by Keibel.) form the rudiments of the pelvis and calyces of the kidney. By further subdivision it gives rise to the collecting tubules of the kidney; whether the secretory tubules are developed from the renal diverti- culum or from the surrounding mesoderm is not as yet deter- mined . The mesoderm around the subdivisions of the ' diverticulum becomes condensed to form the connective tissue and vessels of the kidney.

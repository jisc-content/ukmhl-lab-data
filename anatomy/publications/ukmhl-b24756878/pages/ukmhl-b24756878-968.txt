Stjperficial Branches of the Cervical Plexus (fig. 795) The small occipital (n. occipitalis minor) arises ^^^^ ^ cervical nerve, sometimes also from the third ; it curves round the posteiior border of the Sterno-mastoid, and ascends along the posterior border of the muscle. Near the cranium it perforates the deep fascia, and is contmued Zvards along the side of the head behind the ear, supplymg the ^tegument aSd communicating with the great occipital, the great auricular, and the posterr^uricular\ranch of the facial.

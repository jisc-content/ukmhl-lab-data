1243 THE SPLEEN in size from about i,!,-; of an inch to Jt; of an inch in diameter. They are merely local expansions or hyperplasife of the adenoid tissue of wliich the external coat of the smaller arteries of the spleen is formed. They are most frequently found surrounding the arteriole, which thus seems to tunnel them, but occasionally they grow from one side of the vessel only, and present the appearance of a sessile bud growing from the arterial wall. Klein, however, denies this, and says it is incorrect to describe the Malpighian bodies as isolated masses of adenoid tissue, that they are always formed around an artery, though there is generally a greater amount on one side than on the other, and that, therefore, in trans- verse sections, the artery, in the majority of cases, is found in an eccentric position. These bodies are visible to the naked eye on the surface of a fresh section of the organ, appearing as minute dots of a semi-opaque whitish colour in the dark substance of the pulp. In Fig. 1028.—Transverse section of a portion of the spleen. Trabeculum Malpighian body Spleen pulp minute structure they resemble the adenoid tissue of lymphatic glands, consisting of a delicate reticulum, in the meshes of which he ordinary l3nnphoid cells (fio-. 1028). The reticulum of the tissue is made up of extremely fine fibrils, and°is comparatively open m the centre of the corpuscle, becoming closer at its periphery. The cells which it encloses, like the sujiporting cells of the pulp, are possessed of amoeboid movements, but when treated with carmine become deeply stained, and can be easily distinguished from those

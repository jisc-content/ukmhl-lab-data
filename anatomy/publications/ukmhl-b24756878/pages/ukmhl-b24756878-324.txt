OSTEOLOGY 30G appear just behind and above it. This is the head of the ulna, which articulates with the lower end of the radius and the triangular interarticular fibro-cartilage, and now projects between the tendon of the Extensor carpi uhiaris and that of the Extensor minimi digiti. The Radius The Radius (figs. 358 and 359) is situated on the outer side of the ulna, which exceeds it in length and size. Its upper end is small, and forms only a small part of the elbow-joint ; but its lower end is large, and forms tlie chief part of the Avrist-joint. It is a long bone, prismatic in form, slightly curved longitudinally, and, like other long bones, has a shaft and two extremities. The upper extremity presents a head, neck, and tuberosity. The head (capitulum radii) is of a cylindrical form, depressed on its upper surface mto a shallow cup (fovea capituh radii) which articulates with the capitellum of the humerus. Around the circumference of the head is a smooth, articular surface (circumferentia articularis), broad internally where it articulates with the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, narrow in the rest of its cu-cumference, where it rotates within the orbicular ligament. The head is supported on a round, smooth, and constricted portion called the neck (collum radii), on the back of which is a slight ridge for the insertion of part of the Supmator brevis. Beneath tlie neck, at the inner and front aspect of the bone, is a, rough eminence, the bicipital tuberosity (tuberositas radii) ; its surface is divided by a vertical line into a posterior, rough portion, for the insertion of the tendon of the Biceps, and an anterior, smooth portion, on which a bursa is interposed between the tendon and the bone. The shaft (corpus radii) is prismoid in form, narrower above than below, and slightly curved, so as to be convex outwards. It presents three borders and three surfaces. l. t i-\ The ayiterior border (margo volaris) extends from the lower part ot tlie tuberosity above, to the anterior part of the base of the styloid process below, and separates the anterior from the external surface. Its upper thu'd is very prominent, and from its oblique direction, downwards and outwards, has received the name of the oblique line of the radius; it gives insertion, externaUy. to the Supinator brevis, internaUy, there arises from it the Flexor longus pollicis, and between these the Flexor sublimis digitorum. The middle third of the anterior border is indistinct and rounded. Its lower fourth is sharp prominent, affords msertion to the Pronator quadratus, and gives attachment to the posterior annular ligament of the ^vrist; it termmates m a smaU tubercle, into which is inserted the tendon of the Brachio-radiahs. The vosterior border (margo dorsalis) begms above at the back ot the neck and ends below at the posterior part of the base of the styloid process ; it separates the posterior from the external surface. It is indistinct above and below, but well marked in the middle third of the bone. The internal or interosseous border (crista interossea) begms above, at the back part of the tuberosity, where it is rounded and indistmct; it becomes sharp and prominent as it descends, and at its lower part divides into two ridges which are continued to the anterior and posterior margms of the sigmoid cavTty. To the posterior of the two ridges the lower part of tlie u?Jero«seou membrane is attached, while the triangular surface between the ndges gn insertion to part of the Pronator quadratus. This border separates tli^ ante^ioi from the posterior surface, and throughout the greater part of its extent gives attachment to the interosseous membrane. fnnrtbc; The anterior surface (fades volaris) is concave m "PP^.^^ ".f and gives origin to the Flexor longus pollicis ; it is broad A/^t m ^^^^^^ fourth, and affords insertion to the Pronator quadratus A P^o^^fnfS^ limits the insertion of the Pronator quadratus be ow, and betw^^^ t .'iteri^ • inferior border is a triangular rough surface for the '^"adn lent of he antm^ ligament of the v^Tist-joint.

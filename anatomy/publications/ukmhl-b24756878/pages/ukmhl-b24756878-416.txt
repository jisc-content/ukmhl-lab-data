Viewed as a whole, it presents the shape of a wedge with its base upwards and forwards. The first component of the force is therefore acting against the resistance of the wedge, and its tendency to separate the ihac bones is resisted by the sacro-iliac and iUo-lumbar ligaments and by the ligaments of the symphysis pubis. If a series of coronal sections of the sacro-ihac joints be made, it will be found possible to divide the articular portion of the sacrum into three segments : anterior, Fig. 446.—Coronal section of anterior sacral segment. middle, and posterior. In the anterior segment (fig. 446), which mvolves the first sacral vertebra, the articular surfaces show sUght sinuosities and are abnost parallel to one another ; the distance between their dorsal margins is, however, shghtly greater than that between their ventral margins. This segment therefore presents I shght wedge shape with the truncated apes downwards. The middle segment (fia 447) is a narrow band across the centres of the articulations. Its dorsal width is'cUstinctly greater than its ventral, so that the segment is more defiiiitelv wedge-shaped, the truncated apes being agam directed downwards.

1108 SPLANCHNOLOGY In all ages the mucous membrane of the tongue has received much sedulous considera- tion in disease, and it is certain that the amount and the distribution of the ' fur' with which it may be covered often give valuable help in diagnosis. The fm' consists of lao- liferating or desquamated epithelium, bound up with insi)i8sated mucus, the debris of food, and bacteria of all sorts. The mucous membrane of the tongue may Ijecome chronically inflamed, and presents different appearances in the various stages of the disease, to which the terms leucoplakia and psoriasis lingua; have been given. They are usually the result ^The^ongue, being very vascular, is often the seat of najvoid growths, and these have a tendency to increase rapidly. _ The tongue is frequently the seat of ulceration, which may arise from many causes, as from the irritation of jagged teeth, dyspepsia, tuberculosis, syphilis, and cancer. Of these the cancerous ulcer is the most important and also the most common. The variety is the squamous epitheUoma, which soon develops into an ulcer with an indurated edge, it causes great pain, which speedily extends to all parts supphed wth seasation by the fifth nerve, especially to the region of the ear (amiculo-temporal branch). Cancer of the tongue may necessitate removal of a part or the whole of the organ and many different methods have been adopted for its excision. It may be removed from the mouth by the ecraseur or the scissors. Probably the better method is by the scissors, usually known as Whitehead's method. The mouth is \videly opened with a gag, the tongue transfixed with a stout silk ligatui-e, by which to hold and make traction on it; the reflection of mucous membrane from the tongue to the jaw, and the insertion of the Genio-hyo-glossusarefest divided with a paii' of '=f^ed, blunt.pomted scissors^ The Palato-glossus is also divided. The tongue can now be pulled well out of tjie mouth The bale of the tongue is cut through by a series of short smps, each bleeding vessel ,;Sng dealt with as soon as divided, until the situation of the mam arte^-J' is reached. •The remaining undivided portion of tissue is to be seized ^nth a paii of Wells forceps thTtongue removed, and the vessel secured. In the event of the artery being accidentally infZd, haemorrhage can be at once controlled by passing the forefinger over tS tong^e\m\t torches the epiglottis, and then tm-ning it f-rds he side on w^ch^h artery fs to be compressed, and pushing it forcibly against the jaw (Heath In case where the disease is confined to one side of the tongue t\m of^eratoon may be modihed bv shutting the tongue down the centre and removmg only the agected halt. ^^ rSs where'the submaxillary lymphatic glands are ^^^f^^'l^^^^^^^^^^^^ bout in the s,,bmaxill.t.y region and along S'''', *~*i„°le^^^^ o7Tl,e floor from the mouth.

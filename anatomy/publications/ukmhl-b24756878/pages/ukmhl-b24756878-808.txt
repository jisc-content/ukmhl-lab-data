790 ANGIOLOGY wliich descends and opens either into the receptacuhim chyli or into tin- comnieneement of the thoracic duct. The elTerents of the glands in the upper spaces of the left side terminate in the thoracic duct; those of tin correspondinsj; right spaces, in the right lymphatic duct. 3. The diaphragmatic glands lie on the thoracic aspect of the Dia- plu'agm, and consist of three sets, anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior set consists of (a) two or three small glands behind the base of the ensiform cartilage, which receive afferents from the convex surface of the liver, and (b) one or two glands on either side near the junction of tin seventh rib with its cartilage, which receive lymphatic vessels from the front part of the Diaphragm. The efferent vessels of the anterior set pass to the internal mammary glands. The middle set consists of two or three glands on either side close lo where the phrenic nerves enter the Diaphragm. On the right side some of the glands of this group lie withui the fibrous sac of the pericardmm, on the front of the termination of the inferior vena cava. The afferents of this set are derived from the middle part of the Diaphragm, those on the riglit side also receiving afferents from the convex surface of the liver. Then: efferenis pass to the posterior mediastinal glands. v i f The posterior set consists of a few glands situated on the back ot tne diaphragmatic crura, and connected on the one hand mth the lumbar glands and on the other with the posterior mediastmal glands. The superficial lymphatic vessels of the thoracic wall ramrfy beneath tire skin and converge to the axillary glands. Those over the Trapezius and Latissimus dorsi run forwards and unite to form about ten or twelve trunks which end m the subscapular group. Those over the pectoral region, includmg the vessels from the skm covering the peripheral part of the mamma, run backwards, and those over the Serratus magnus upwards, to the pectoral group. Others near the lateral margm of the sternum pass mwards between the rib cartilages and end in the internal mammary glands, while the vessels of opposite sides anastomose across the front of the sternum, a the few vessels from the upper part of the pectoral region pass upwards over clavicle to the supraclavicular group of cervical glands. The lymphatic vessels of the mammary gland origmate m a plexus m tue interlobular spaces and on the walls of the galactophorous ducts Those from the central part of the gland pass to an intricate plexus situated beneath the areola, a plexus which receives also the lymphatics from the skm over the central part of the gland and those from the areola and mpple. "s efferent^ are coUected into two trunks which pass to the pectoral group of axiUaiy glands. The vessels which drain the inner part of the mammary gland pierce the thoracic waU and end in the internal mammary S^^nds, while a % esse! has occasionaUy been seen emerging from the upper part of |he gW aiid piercin- the Pectoralis major, to termhiate m the subclavicular glands (fag. b55).

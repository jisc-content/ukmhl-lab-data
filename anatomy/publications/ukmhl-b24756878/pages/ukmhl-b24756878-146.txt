128 EMBRYOLOGY nerves, is tte liomologue of tke oval bundle in the cord whicli had its origin in the posterior nerve-roots. The motor or efferent nerves arise as outgrowths of the neuroblasts situated in the basal laminae of the mid- and hind-brain. While, however, the anterior spinal nerve-roots arise in one series from the basal lamina, the cranial motor nerves Fro. 161.—^Transverse section of medulla oblongata of human embr}'o. x 32.

To the former set belong the third, fourth, sixth, and twelfth nerves; to the latter, the eleventh and the motor fibres of the fifth, seventh, ninth, and tenth nerves (figs. 161, 162). The Nose.—The development of the nose has already been con- sidered (pages 110, 111). The olfactory nerves are de- veloped from the cells of the ectoderm which lines the olfac- tory pits ; these cells undergo prohferation and give rise to what are termed the olfa<:iory cells of the nose. The axons of the olfactory cells grow into the overlying olfactory bulb and form the olfactory nerves. The Eye. The development of the eyes commences by the protrusion of a pair of diverticula from the lateral aspects of the fore-brain. These diverticula are known as the opic vesicles; they project towards the sides of the head, and the peripheral part of each expands to form a hollow bulb while the proximal part remains narrow and constitutes the optic stall (figs. 163, lo4 .

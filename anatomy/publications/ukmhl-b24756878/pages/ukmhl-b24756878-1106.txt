SPLANCHNOLOGY 1088 tho lungs. It is essential, too, that in every case the two sides of the chest should Ijo com- pared with one another, and that the wide variations that may be met with under normal conditions in dilTeront persons and at difl'erent ages should Ije kept in mind when the chest is beinji examined. On inspection the thorax will be seen to be enlarged and barrel-shaped in emi)hysema, in which the volume of the lungs is increased by dilatation of their alveoli, or in an acute attack of asthma, or when a large iileural effusion or mediastinal tumour is Ijresont. The chest-wall will be flattened or sunken, on the other hand, over an area of lung that has collapsed or become fibrosed, as often happens in chronic pulmonary tuber- culosis. The respiratory movements of the chest-wall will be lessened, or even absent, over a part or the whole of the affected side in such acute disorders as pleui-isy, pneumonia, or pleural eftusion, or in more chronic disease where the underlying lung is fibrosed, or Ls crushed to one side by a mediastinal tumour ; and by the use of the a:-rays a corresponding loss of movement or displacement of the Diaphragm on the affected side can often be observed. Under normal concUtions the intercostal spaces are a Httle depressed; but they may be obliterated or even bulgmg on that side when a large effusion or new growth fills up one of the pleui'al cavities. On polpation the hand can be used to verify the eye's impressions as to the degree ot movement on respiration of any part of the chest-wall. The facility with which the ^^bra- tions produced by the voice are conducted from the larynx by the underljong lung to the hand (in the form of vocal fremitus) can also be tested. The vocal fremitus is commonly much increased over the consolidated area ui pneumonia or in fibrosis of the lung, and much diminished over a pleural effusion when the lung is pushed up by the fluid towards the top of the pleural cavity. It is also diminished, but to a less extent, m emphysema, and in bronchitis when the "bronchi are blocked by secretion. In bronchitis the bubblmg of the secretion in the tubes can often be felt by a hand placed on the chest-waU as the patient breathes; and in chi-onic pleurisy the friction of the two roughened pleural surfaces against one another can sometimes be felt in the same way. ■, , , . j On vercussion, the normal resonance of the pulmonary tissue is found to be increased in emphysema, and in pneumothorax (page 1078) tHs hyper-resonance may be still further increased The resonance is lessened in any condition causing collapse or solidihcation of the lung-tissue, or when its place is taken by fluid (pleural effusion) or some sohd growth (mediastinal tumoiu-). Thus dulness on percussion at the bases o the lungs common n the hypostatic congestion of the bases seen in heart-failure ; dulness at the right base is often due to compilssion of the lung by enlargement of the hver ; some dulness at the apex of a lung is frequently met with in tuberculosis of that part, before the disease progressed vefy far. Comjlete dulness over one side of the chest, back and front ahke, ^cept at the Ipex, is common when a large pleural effusion has taken t^e lung s place Von Koranyi, Gi-occo, and others, have di-awn attention to a triangular patch of dulne^.. along the wtebral cdumn (the paravertebral triangle of dulness) on the uiiafiected side in pleural Iffusion ; tins triangle of dulness is said to be absent in other conditions cai^ ng KTulmonary I'esonance o'n percussion, and is due to ^^^^1%^^^''^,:^^^^^^ posterior mecUastinum towards the sound side.

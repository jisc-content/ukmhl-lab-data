NEUROLOGY 852 into the optic tract of the same side. Occupying the posterior part of the CO mnissml however, is a strand of fibres winch is not derived from Uie optic nerves • this constitutes the commissure oj Oudden, and has already been referred to as forming a connecting hnk between the internal gemculate ^°^Dtic tracts —The optic tracts are continued backwards and outwards from the postero-iateral angles of the optic commissure. Each passes between the anteSor perforated sjace and the tuber cinereum, and, ^.anding romd the ventro-lateral aspect of the crus cerebri, dmdes into a mesial and a ateia root The former comprises the fibres of Gudden's commissure. The lateral rootconsfsts mainly ol afferent fibres which arise in the x^tina and undergo partial decussation in the optic commissure, as described ;, ^ut it also contams a few fine efferent fibres which have their origins in the bram and then ter ■ miSltions in tl\e retina. When traced backwards, the fibres of the lateral root Snouiid o end in the external geniculate body and pulvmar of the optic TalaZs and in tlie upper quadilgeminal body ; and these three structures constS the lower visual cmtres. Fibres arise from the nerve-cells in tliese LrpasTtlirough the Mndmost part of tl^^ int-n^capsule vmder the name of the opiic radiations, to the cortex of the occipital lobe of the cerebium where the higher visual centre is situated.

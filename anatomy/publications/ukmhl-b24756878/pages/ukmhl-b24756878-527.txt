MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN 509 tlie ilio-inguinal nerve in the female : it is much larger in men than in women, on account of the large size of the spermatic cord. The intercolumnar fibres (fibrae intercrurales) are a series of curved tendinous fibres, which arch across the loM'er part of the aponeurosis of the External oblique, describing a curve with the convexity downwards. They have received then* name from stretching across between the two pillars of the external ring. They are much thicker and stronger at the outer margui of the external ring, where they are connected to Poupart's ligament, than internally, where they are inserted into the linea alba. They are more strongly developed in the male than in the female. The intercolumnar fibres increase the strength of the lower part of the aponeurosis, and prevent tlie divergence of the pillars from one another. Fro. 604.—The Internal oblique muscle. Cunjoined tendon Cremastei' These intercolumnar fibres, as they pass across the external abdominal ring, are themselves connected together by delicate fibrous tissue, thus forming : a fascia, which, as it is attached to the pillars of the ring, covers it in, and is caUed the intercolumnar fascia. This intercolumnar fascia is continued ' clowTi as a tubular prolongation around the spermatic cord and testis, and ' encloses them in a distmct sheath ; hence it is also called the external spermatic ■ jascia. The external abdominal ring is only seen as a distinct aperture after 1 the external spermatic fascia has been removed from its pillars. t ligament (lig. inguinale) is the lower border of the aponeurosis ' , 1 J^xternal oblique muscle, and extends from the anterior superior spine ' ot the ihum to the spine of the pubis. From this latter point it is reflected backwards and outwards to be attached to the pectineal line for about half ■ an inch, forming Gimbernat's ligament. Its general direction is convex

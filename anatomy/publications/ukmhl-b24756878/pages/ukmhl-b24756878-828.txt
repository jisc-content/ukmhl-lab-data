Other congenital abnormalities of the spinal cord occur in connection with spina bifida (see page 201), and also in syrin„eKa.

In its early em- bryonic condition it consists of three hollow vesicles, termed the fore-brain, the mid-brain, and the hind- brain ; and the parts derived from each of these can be recognised in the adult (fig. 686). Thus, in the process of development the wall of the hind-bram (rhombencephalon) under- goes modification to form the medulla oblongata, the pons Varolii, and cere- bellum, while its cavity is expanded to form the fourth ventricle.

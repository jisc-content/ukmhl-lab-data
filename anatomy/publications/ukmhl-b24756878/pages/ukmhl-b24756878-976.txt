Anterior view. ^.j^g back part of the radial side of the forearm, to the wrist. It suppUes the integument of the lower two-thirds of the forearm, communicating with the radial nerve and the ex- ternal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral. The musculo-cutane- ous nerve presents fre- quent irregularities. It may adhere for some distance to the median and then pass outwards, beneath the Biceps, in- stead of through the Coraco-brachialis. Fre- quently some of the fibres of the median run for some distance in. the musculo-cutaneous and then leave it to jom their proper trunk. Less fre- quently the reverse is the case, and the median sends a branch to join the musculo - cutaneous. Instead of piercmg the Coraco - brachiaUs tlie nerve may pass under it or through the Biceps. OccasionaUy it gives a filament to the Pronator teres, and it has been seen to supply the back of the thumb when the radial nerve was absent. The internal cuta- neous (n. cutaneus anti- brachii mediaUs) (fig. 801) arises from the inner cord in common with the ulnar and internal head of tlie median, and, at its com- mencement, Ues on the It derives its fibres from the eighth cervica - off near the axilla, a filament, ^Ahicli liadial C.6.7 arises The nerve tneii \}<^^^^^'' , divides into two branches, an anterior and a posteiio

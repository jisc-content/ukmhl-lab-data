SPECIAL TYPES OF CEREBRAL CORTEX 883 3. In the liippocampus major the molecular layer is very thick and contains a large number of Golgi cells. It lias been divided into three strata: (a) s. convolutum or s. granulosum, containing many tangential fibres ; (6) s. lacunosum, presenting numerous lymphatic or vascular spaces ; (c) s. radiatum, exhibiting a rich plexus of fibrils. The two layers of pyramidal cells are condensed into one, and the cells are mostly of large size. The axons of the cells in the polymorphous layer may run in an ascending, a descending, or a horizontal direction. Between the poljonorphous layer and the ventricular ependyma is the white substance of the alveus. 4. In the rudimentary dentate convolution the molecular layer contains some pyramidal cells, while the layer of pyramidal cells is almost entirely represented by smaU ovoid cells. 5. The olfactory bulb.—In many of the lower animals this contains a cavity which communicates through the hollow olfactory stalk with the lateral ventricle. In man the original cavity is filled up by neurogha and its wall becomes thickened, but much more so on its ventral than on its dorsal aspect. Its dorsal part contains a small amount of grey and white matter, but it is scanty and ill defined. A section through the ventral part (fig. 749) shows it to consist of the follo^ving layers from without inwards : (1) A layer of oKactory Ra. 749.—Coronal section of olfactory bulb, (Sohwalbe.)

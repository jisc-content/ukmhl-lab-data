EMBRYOLOGY 92 the primitive iiliraentary canal (fig. lU). At the same time a part of the ctt'lom is enclosed within the embrj'o and forms the rudiment of the pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal cavities. Although the embryo grows in all directions, it increases much more rapidly in length than in width, and its cephalic and caudal extremities are bent downwards to form the cephalic and caudal fohh respectively (figs. 198 and 199). The pro-amniotic area, lying immediately in front of the pericardial area (see page 87), forms the anterior Umit of the slow-growing embryonic margin. The forward growth of the head therefore carries with it the posterior end of the pericardial area so that this area becomes inverted ; its posterior border becomes anterior and its dorsal surface ventral. When the cephalic and caudal flexures have been formed, the primitive alimentary canal presents the appearance of a nearly straight tulje, closed at its two extremities. TMs tube is divided into three portions, ^^z. : (a) the fm-e-gut, between the pericardium and the notochord ; (b) the mid-gut, opemng "directly into the yolk-sac ; and (c) the hind-gut, contained within the caudal fold (fig. 199). The passage between the mid-gut and the yolk-sac is at first relatively wide, but it is gradually narrowed and at the same time lengthened to form a tubular duct, the vitelline duct. MEMBRANES AND APPENDAGES OF THE EMBRYO.* These are concerned with the protection and nourishment of the embryo, and comprise (1) the yolk-sac, the amnion, the allantois, the chorion, and the umbihcal cord, which are'of embryonic origin; (2) the decidua, which is produced bv a modification of the mucous membrane of the uterus ; and (3) the placenta, which is derived partly from embryonic and partly from maternal tissues.

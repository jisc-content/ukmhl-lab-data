THE BLADDER 1199 whole organ is situated in the pelvis ; the neck, in the male, corresponding to a line drawn horizontally backwards through the symphysis, a Uttlc below its middle. As the bladder becomes distended it gradually rises out of the pelvis into the abdomen, and formsa swelhng in the hypogastric region, which is perceptible to the hand, as well as to percussion. In extreme distension it reaches into the umbilical region. Under these circumstances the lower part of its anterior surface, for a distance of about two inches above the symphysis pubis, is closely applied to the abdominal wall, without the intervention of iieritoneum, so that it can be tapped by an opening in the middle line just above the symphysis pubis, without any fear of wounding the serous membrane. VVlien the rectum is distended, the prostatic portion of the urethra is elongated and the bladder lifted out of the pelvis and the peritoneum pushed upwards. When distended the bladder can be felt in the male, from the rectum, behind the prostate, and fluctuation can be perceived by a bimanual examination, one finger being introduced into the rectum and the distended bladder tapped on the front of the abdomen with the finger of the other hand. This portion of the bladder—that is, the portion felt in the rectum by the finger—is also uncovered by peritoneum, and the bladder may here be punctured from the rectum, in the middle hne, without risk of wounding the serous membrane. Applied Anatomy.—defect of development, in which the bladder is impUcated, is known under the name of extroversion of the Madder. In this condition the lower part of the abdominal wall and the anterior wall of the bladder are wanting, so that the posterior surface of the bladder presents on the abdominal surface, and is pushed forwards by the pressure of the viscera mthin the abdomen, forming a red vascular tumour on which the openings of the ureters are visible. The penis, except the glans, is rudimentary and IS cleft on its dorsal sm-face, exposing the floor of the ui-ethra, a condition known as epispadias. The pelvic bones are also arrested in development (see page 331). The bladder may be ruptured by violence applied to the abdominal wall, when the jiscus IS distended, without any mjuiy to the bony pelvis, or it may be torn in cases of fracture of the pelvis. The rupture may be either intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal: that IS, may implicate the superior surface of the bladder in the former case, or one of the other surfaces in the latter. Until recently intraperitoneal ruptui-e was uniformly fatal but now abdommal section and suturing the rent mth Lembert's suture Ls resorted to with a very considerable amount of success. The sutures are inserted only through the' peri- toneal and muscular coats in such a way as to bring the seroiLS surfaces at the maro-ins of the wound mto apposition, and one is inserted just beyond each end of the wound" The bladder should be tested as to whether it is water-tight before closing the external incision I he muscular coat of the bladder undergoes hypertrophy in cases in which there is any obstruction to the flow of mine. Under these circumstances the bundles of which the muscular coat consists become much increased in size, and, interiacing in all directions give nse to what is known as the fasciculated bladder. Between these muscular bundles the mucous membrane may bulge out, forming sacculi, constituting the sacculated bladder, and m these little pouches phosphatic concretions may collect, forming encysted calculi. ihe mucous membrane is very loosely attached, except over the trigone, to allow of the distension of the viscus. Various forms of tumour have been found springing from the wall of the bladder The commonest innocent tumour is the villous papilloma. Of the malignant tumom-s, epi- thelioma IS the most common, but sarcoma is occasionally found in the bladder of children in doubtful cases the cystoscope proves a valuable aid in diagnosis.

1124 SPLANCHNOLOGY small, omentum. If tliis layer of the small omentum be followed to tlie right it will be found to turn round the hepatic artery, bile-duct, and portal vein, and become continuous with tlie anterior wall of the lesser sac, forming a free folded edge of peritoneum. Traced downwards, it covers the antero-superior surface of°the stomach and the commencement of the duodenum, and is carried down from the greater curvature of the stomach into a large free fold, known as the gastro-colic or great omentum. Reaching the free margin of this fold, it is reflected upwards to cover the under and posterior surfaces of the trans- verse colon, and thence to the posterior abdominal wall as the inferior layer of the transverse mesocolon. It reaches the abdominal wall at the upper border of the third part of the duodenum, and is then carried down on the superior mesenteric vessels to the small intestine as the anterior layer of the mesentery. It encircles the intestine, and subsequently may be traced, as the posterior layer of the mesentery, upwards and backwards to the abdominal wall. From this it sweeps down over the aorta into the pelvis, where it invests the pelvic colon, its reduplication forming the pelvic mesocolon. Leaving first the sides and then the front of the rectum, it is reflected on to the base of the bladder and, after covering the upper surface of that vi-scus is carried along the urachus and obliterated hypogastric arteries (fig. 924) on to the back of the abdominal wall to the level from which a start was made. Between the rectum and the bladder it forms, in the male, a pouch the recto-vesical pouch, the bottom of which is about the level of the middle of the vesiculee seminales—i.e. about three inches from the orifice of the anus. When the bladder is distended, the peritoneum is carried up ^^^tll the expanded viscus so that a considerable part of the anterior surface of the latter Ues directly against the abdominal waU wdthout the intervention of peritoneal membrane In the female the peritoneum is reflected from the rectum on to the upper part of the posterior vaginal wall, forming the recto-vaginal pouc/i or vouch of Douglas. It is continued over the posterior surface and fundus of the uterus on to its anterior surface, which it covers as far as the junction of the body and cervix uteri, and then to the bladder, formmg here a second, but shallower, pouch, the utero-vesical pouch. It is also reflected from the sides of the uterus to the lateral waUs of the pelvis as two expanded folds, the broad ligaments of the uterus, in the free margin of each of which is the FaUopian ^''^Vertical disposition of the lesser sac (fig. 923) -A start may be made in this case on the posterior abdominal wall above the pancreas. From thl^ egion the peritoneum may be followed upwards on to tl- "^r surf^^^^^^^^^^ thi Diaphragm, and thence on to the Spigelian and caudate lobes of the In er to the fissure for the ductus venosus and the transverse fissure Traced laterally Tis continuous over the inferior vena cava with the posterior wall S the gr'eater sac. From the liver it is carried dow^rds to the lesser curva- ture of the stomach as the posterior layer of the gastro4iepa ic omen^^^^^^ and is continuous on the right, round the hepatic artery, bile-duct and poita vein 'vSh the greater sac. The posterior layer of the gastro-liepatie omentum IS carried down to the greater curvature of the stomach as a covering for the posters-infer or surface of tliis viscus, and from the greater curvature is ?oSed Ziwards as the deep layer of the g-«tro-colic or gre.^^^^^ From the free margin of this fold it is reflected upwards on itself ^ ^he anterior and superior surfaces of the transverse colon, and thence as ^^^^^ ^^P^^^^^ X of the transverse meso-colon to the upper ^^^l^^^' f^, f ^^^^^^^^^ duodenum, from which it may be followed over tlie front " * ^« P'J^;^ the level from wliich a start was made. It will be seen that tl e yornied 03 the wall of the lesser sac below the transverse colon folloA.s, -^"^ i*^ /■loselj intestine therefore consists of four layers, Uvo anteuoi and t^^o po.ie separated by the potential cavity of the lesser sac transverse in the two regions, viz. in the pelvis and in the abdomen propei.

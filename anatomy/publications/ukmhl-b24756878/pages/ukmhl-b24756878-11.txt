PEEFAOE TO THE SEVENTEENTH EDITION IN this Edition the text has been carefully revised and, in several sections, rearranged. The B.N.A. terminology has been added in brackets after the names commonly used by English anatomists. Increased attention has been given to the clinical applications of anatomical data ; the title Surgical Anatomy has been replaced by that of Applied Anatomy, and under this heading many im- portant medical considerations are discussed. Me. Eedde Fedden has revised the surgical, and Dr. A. J. Jex-Blake has added the medical, notes in these paragraphs. Some two hundred additional engravings have been introduced, mostly in the sections of Embryology, Angiology, Neurology and Splanchnology. A few of these have been borrowed from standard works, and some are copied from models by His, Keibel and others, but the majority have been drawn from original preparations. The Editor acknowledges, with gratitude, the valuable help he has received from Mr. Frank Howson, M.A., Lecturer on Physiology, and Dr. J. Dunlop Lickley, Demonstrator of Anatomy, in this College. Mr. Howson undertook the revision of the Histological part of the book and furnished microscopic sUdes for drawings. Dr. Lickley has rendered invaluable and ungrudging service in the revision of the text, in the preparation of the Index, and in the making of dissections for the purposes of illustration.

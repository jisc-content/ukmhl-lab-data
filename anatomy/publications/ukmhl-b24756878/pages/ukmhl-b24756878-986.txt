968 NEUROLOGY Branches.—Numerous slender muscular filaments supply the Intercostals, the Infracostales, the Levatores costarura, the Serratus posticus superior, and the Triangularis sterni muscles. At the front of the chest some of these branches cross the costal cartilages from one intercostal space to another. Lateral cutaneous nerves (rami cutanei laterales).—These are derived from the intercostal nerves, midway between the vertebrje and sternum ; they pierce the External intercostarand Serratus magnus muscles, and divide into anterior and posterior branches. The anterio7- branches (rami anteriores) are reflected forwards to the side and the fore part of the chest, supplying the integument of the chest and mamma ; those of the fiftli and sixth nerves supply the upper digitations of the External oblique. The posterior branches (rami posteriores) are reflected backwards, to supply the integument over the scapula and over the Latissimus dorsi. The lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve is of large size, and does not divide, like the other nerves, into an anterior and a posterior branch. It is named, from its origin and distribution, the intercosio-humeral nerve (n. intercostobrachialis) (fig. 801). It pierces the External intercostal muscle and the Serratus magnus, crosses the axilla to the inner side of the arm, and joins with a filament from the nerve of Wrisberg It then pierces the fascia, and supplies the skm of the upper half of the inner and back part of the arm, communicatmg mth the internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve. The size of this nerve is in inverse proportion to the size of the other cutaneous nerves, especially the nerve of Wrisberg. A second intercosto-humeral nerve is frequently given off from the third intercostal. It supplies filaments to the armpit and inner side of the arm. . ^. . . , The lower thoracic nerves.—The anterior divisions of the seventh, eighth ninth, tenth, and eleventh thoracic nerves are continued anteriorJy from the intercostal spaces into the abdominal wall; hence these nerves are named thoracico-abclominal intercostal nerves. They have the same arrangement as the upper ones as far as the anterior extremities of the mtercostal spaces, where they pass beliind the costal cartilages, and between the Internal obhque and Transversalis muscles, to the sheath of the Rectus, which they perforate. Thev supply the Rectus muscle, and terminate in branches which become subcutaneous near the linea alba. These branches are named the anierwr cutaneous nerves of the abdomen. They are directed outward^ as far as t^^^^ lateral cutaneous nerves and supply the integument of the front of the belly.

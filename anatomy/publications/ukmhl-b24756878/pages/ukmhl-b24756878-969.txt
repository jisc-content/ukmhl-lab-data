The inner or sternal branches (im. supraclaviculares anteriores) cross obliquely over the external jugular vein and the clavicular and sternal attach- ments of the Sterno-mastoid, and supply the integument as far as the median line. They furnish one or two filaments to the sterno-clavicular joint. The middle or clavicular branches (nn. supraclaviculares medii) cross the clavicle, and supply the integument over the Pectoral and Deltoid muscles, communicating with the cutaneous branches of the upper intercostal nerves. The external or acromial branches (nn. supraclaviculares posteriores) pass obUquely across the outer surface of the Trapezius and the acromion, and supply the integument of the upper and back part of the shoulder.

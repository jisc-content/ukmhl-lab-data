714 ANGIOLOGY ' Relations.—B('/(/7i(?, it lies from above downwards upon the Iliacus, Pectineus, Adductor hvevis, and Adductor nuvguus. In front, it is separated horn the femoral artery by the femoral and ])rofunda veins above, and by the Adductor lonpus below. On its outer side, the origin of the Vastus internus intervenes between it and the femur. Pecvliarities.—This vessel sometimes arises from the inner side, and, more rarely, from the baclc of the femoral artery ; but a more important peculiarity, from a surgica! point of view, is that relating to the height at which the vessel arises. In three-fourths of a large number of cases it arose between one and two inches below Poupart s ligament; in a few cases the distance was less than an inch; more rarely, opposite the ligament ; and in one case above Poupart's ligament, from the external ihac. Occasionally the distance between the origin of the vessel and Poupart's ligament exceeds two mches. The profunda gives oS the following branches : External circumflex. Internal circumflex. Three perforating. Muscular. The external circumflex (a. circumflexa femoris lateraUs) suppUes the muscles on the front of the thigh. It arises from the outer side of the profunda, passes horizontally outwards, between the divisions of the anterior crural nerve, and behind the Sartorius and Rectus femoris, and diAades mto ascendnig, transverse, and descending branches. +1, To,i=r,r The ascending branch (ramus ascendens) passes upwards, beneath the iensor fasciae femoris muscle, to the outer side of the hip, and anastomoses with the terminal branches of the gluteal and deep circumflex ihac arteries. The descending branch (ramus descendens) runs downwards, behind the Kectus upon the Vastus externus to which it gives oflsets ; one long branch descends in the muscle as far as the Imee, and anastomoses with the superior external articular branch of the popliteal artery. It is accompamed by the branch ot tlie anterior crural nerve to the Vastus externus. over The transverse branch (ramus transversus), the smallest, passes o^^^^^f J?^^ the Crureus, pierces the Vastus externus and mnds round the f^?^^' 3^^^^^^^^ the great trochanter, anastomosing at the back of the thigh vnth the mternal circumflex, sciatic, and superior perforating arteries.

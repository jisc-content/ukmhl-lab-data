1170 SPLANCHNOLOGY pavement, tlio centre of each polygonal space presenting a minute aperture, the mouth of an intralobular vein (lig. 962). Microscopic appearance {fig. 965).—Each lolnile consists of a mass of cells (hepalic cells), surrounded by a dense capillary ]3lexus, com|)Osed of vessels which penetrate from the circumference to the centre of the lobule, and terminate in the inlralobular vein, which runs through its centre, to open at its base into one of the sublohular veins. Between the cells are also the minute bile capillaries. Therefore, in the lobule there are all the essentials of a secreting gland ; that is to say : {I)cells, by which the secretion is formed ; (2) blood- vessels, in close relation with the cells, containing the blood from which the secretion is derived ; (3) ducts, by which the secretion, when formed, is carried away. (1) The hepatic cells are more or less s^jheroidal in form ; but may be rounded, flattened, or many-sided from mutual compression. They vary in size from y^jf to tji^Vo of an inch in diameter. They consist of a honeycomb network, and contain one or sometimes two distinct nuclei. Tlie nucleus contains an intranuclear network and one or two refractile nucleoh. Imbedded in the honeycomb network are numerous yellow particl&s, the colouring-matter of the bile, and fat globules. The cells adhere together by their surfaces so as to form rows, which radiate from the centre to the ckcumference of the lobules.* (2) The blood.vessels.-The blood in the capillary Pl^f^''^^^'^^JJ^^Jj^'Hw brought to the liver principally by the portal veni, but also to a certam extent b> the ^'"^"e artery, entering the liver at the transverse fissure with P-^^l ^/^n ^^^^ hepatic duet,, ramifies mth these vessels t^hrough the P^^^^^l ; fo^ branches which ramify in the capsule of Glisson, and appear to be destined cliiett> lor rnc nutnton :f the coats'^3f the vesLls and ducts It also g^-s oft reach the surface of the organ, terminating in its fibrous coat '"Y^VJ eaA lobu^^^^ to it gives off interlobular branches, which form a plexus on the outer f J ° /^^"^'^ ]° supply the walls of the interlobular y^i^s and the accompanying b^^^^^^^ pllius lobular branches enter the lobule and end m the ^^^^^ "^^^^^^^^ he Sa canals, The pcyrlal vein also enters at the transverse fissure, and tj.™"?';, ,,reak .

It is regarded as being alsffntTnld to prevent the folds into which all portions of the capsule would Sernateiy fall in^he varying positions of the joint from being driven between the bones by the pressure of the atmosphere. , ,, • • x Th pecuhar relations of the Biceps tendon to the «l^°^l<i;^i«i^ , ^PP^^j! subserve%arious purposes. In the first place, by its connection mth botii the shoulder and elbow the muscle harmonises the action of t^e two joints and acts as an elastic hgament in all positions, m the manner previously discussed (see page 372). Next, it strengthens the upper part of the articular cavity, and pievents the head of the humerus from being pressed up against the ^^^romion p ocess when the Deltoid contracts; it thus fixes the head of the humerus as the centic ot motion in the glenoid cavity. By its passage along the bicipital groove it assist, in rendering the head of the humerus steady in the various i^oy^^mf 9^*^^ arm. When the arm is raised from the side it assists the Supra- f^^J^J^f ^^p^ , in rotating the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity. It also holds the head of the bone firmly in contact with the glenoid cavity and prevents its ^lipprng over its lower edge, or being displaced by the action of the Latissimus dorsi and Pectoralis major, as in climbing and many other movements. Surface J-orm.—The direction and position of the shoulder-joint may be indicated by a line drawn from the middle of the coraco-acromial ligament, in a curved <!iyection witn its convexity inwards, to the innermost part of that portion of the head of the Hummus which can be felt in the axilla when the arm is forcibly abducted from the side. When the arm hangs by the side, not more than one-third of the head of the bone is m contact with the glenoid cavity, and three-quarters of its circumference is in front of a vertical line drawn from the anterior border of the acromion process. Applied Anatomy—Owing to the construction of the shoulder-joint and the freedom of movement which it enjoys, as well as in consequence of it^ exposed situation, it is more * Journ. of Anat. a/nd Phys.

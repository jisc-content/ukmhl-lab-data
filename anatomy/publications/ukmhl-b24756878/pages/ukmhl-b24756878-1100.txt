SPLANCHNOLOGY 1082 accommodates the vena azygos major ; while runnmg uiiwards, and then arching outwards some little distance below the apex, is a wide groove for the superior vena cava and right innominate vein, and behind this, nearer the apex, is a second furrow for the innominate artery. Along the back part of the inner surface is a vertical groove for the oesophagus ; tliis groove becomes less distinct below, owing to the inclination of the lower part of the oesophagus to the left of the middle line. In front and to the right of the lower part of the cBSophageal groove, the inner surface is applied to the pleural covering of the right and posterior aspects of the thoracic part of the inferior vena cava—this Fig. 895.—Mediastinal surface of left lung. vessel being accommodated in a deep concavity. On the left lung (fig. 895). immediately above the hilus, is a weU-marked curved furro\\- produced by the aortic arch, and running upwards from tliis towards the apex is a gi'oove accommodating the left subclavian artery ; a slight impression m front of the latter and close to the margin of the lung lodges the left innominate vein. Behind the hilus and pericardial depression is a vertical furro\v produced by the descending thoracic aorta, and in front of this, near the base of the lung, the lower part of the oesophagus causes a shallow depression. The posterior border (margo posterior) is broad and rounded, and is received into the deep concavity on either side of the vertebral column. It is much longer than the anterior border, and projects, below, mto the upper part ot the phrenico-costal sinus. , The anterior border (margo anterior) is thin and sharp, and o%eilaps the front of the pericardium.

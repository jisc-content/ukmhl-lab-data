1048 ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE front of the semicircular canals. It is somewhat ovoid in shape, flattened froni within out\\^ards, and measures about one-fifth of an inch from before backwards, tlio same from above downwards, and about one-eighth of an inch from without inwards. On its outer or tympanic wall is the fenestra ovalis, closed, in the recent state, by the base of the stapes and annular ligament. On its inner wall, at the fore part, is a small circular depression, the recessus sphcericus, which is perforated, at its anterior and inferior part, by several minute holes (macula cribrosa media) for the passage of filaments of the auditory nerve to the saccule ; and behind this depression is an oblique ridge, the crista vesiibuli, the anterior end of which is named the pyramid (pyramis vestibuli). This ridge bifurcates below to enclose a small depression, the fossa cochlearis, which is perforated by a number of holes for the passage of filaments of the auditory nerve ^^'hich supply the posterior end of the ductus cochlearis. At the hinder part of the inner wall is the orifice of the aquceductus vestibuli, which extends to the posterior surface of the j)etrous x^ortion of the temporal bone. It transmits a small vein, and contains a tubular prolongation of the membranous labjTinth, the ductus endolymphaticus, which ends in a cul-de-sac between the layers of the dura mater within the cranial cavity.

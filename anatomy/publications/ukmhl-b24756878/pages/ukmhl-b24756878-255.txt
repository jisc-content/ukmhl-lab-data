With the exception of the internal pterygoid plates, the bone is ossified in cartilage. There are fourteen centres in all (fig. 304), six for the pre-sphenoid and eight for the post-sphenoid division. Pre-spJienoid division.—About the ninth week of foetal life an ossific centre appears for each of the lesser VAings (orbito-sphenoids) just outside the optic foramen. Shortly afterwards two nuclei for the pre-sphenoid part of the body appear on the inner sides of the optic foramina. The sphenoidal turbinated bones are each developed from a centre which makes its appearance abont the fifth month; * at birth they consist of small triangular laminsc, and it is not till the third year that they become hollowed out and cone-shaped; about the fourth year they fuse with the lateral masses of the ethmoid, and between the ninth and twelfth years they unite with the sphenoid. Post-sphenoid division.— The first ossific nuclei are those for the greater wings (ali-spheuoids). They make their appearance between the foramen rotundum and foramen ovale about the eighth week, and from them the external pterygoid plates also are formed.f Soon after, the centres for the post- sphenoid part of the body appear, one on either side of the sella turcica, and become blended together about the middle of foetal hfe. Each internal pterygoid plate (with the exception of its hamular process) is ossified in membrane, and its centre probably appears about the ninth or tenth week; the hamular process becomes chondrified during the third month, and almost at once undergoes ossifica- tion (Fawcett, op. cit.). The internal joins the external pterygoid plate about the sixth month. About the fourth month a centre appears for each lingula and speedily joins the rest of the bone. The pre-sphenoid is united to the post-sphenoid about the eighth month, and at birth (fig. 305) the bone consists of three pieces : a central, consisting of the body and lesser ^\angs, and two lateral, each comprising a greater wing and pterygoid pro- cess. In the first year after Fig. 305.—Sphenoid bone at birth. Posterior aspect. birth the greater wings and body become united, and the orbito-sphenoids extend in- wards alDove the anterior part of the body, and, meeting with each other in the middle line, form an elevated smooth surface, termed the jugum sphenoidale. By the twenty- fifth year the sphenoid and occipital are completely fused. -J J- • • .1 .

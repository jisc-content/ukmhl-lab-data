404 SYNDESMOLOGY flat fasciculus, naiTOwer at the middle than at the extremities, attached by one end to the base of the coracoid process, and by the other to the inner extremity of tlie scapular notch. The suprascapular nerve passes through the foramen ; the suprascapular vessels pass over the ligament. Tlie ligament is sometimes ossified. The Spino-glenoid Ligament (lig. transversum scapula inferius) consists of a band of fibres, situated on the posterior surface of the neck of the scapula and stretching from the outer border of the spine to the margm of the glenoid cavity. It forms an arch under which the suprascapular vessels and nerve pass as they enter the infraspinous fossa. III. SHOULDER-JOINT (ARTICULATIO HUMERI) The shoulder-joint (fig. 450) is an enarthrodial or ball-and-socket joint. The bones entering into its formation are the large hemispherical head of the humerus and the shallow glenoid cavity of the scapula, an arrangement which permits of very considerable movement, while the joint itself is protected against displacement by the tendons which surround it. The ligaments do not maintain the joint surfaces in apposition, because when they alone remain the humerus can be separated to a considerable extent from the glenoid cavity ; their use, therefore, is to lunit the amount of movement. The joint is pro- tected above by an arch, formed by the coracoid and acromion processes, and the coraco-acromial ligament. The articular surfaces are covered by cartilage : that on the head of the humerus is thicker at the centre than at the circum- ference, the reverse being the case m the glenoid cavity. The ligaments of the shoulder are : Capsular. Gleno-humeral. Coraco-humeral. Transverse Humeral. Glenoid.* The Capsular Ligament (capsula articularis) completely encircles the articulation, being attached, above, to the ckcumference of the glenoid cavity beyond the glenoid Ugament; below, to the anatomical neck of the humerus, approachms nearer to the articular cartilage above than m the rest ot its extent It is thicker above and below than elsewhere, and is remarkably loose and lax, and much larger and longer than is necessary to keep the bones in contact, aUowing them to be separated from each other more than an mch, an evident provision for that extreme freedom of movement which is peculiar to this articulation. It is strengthened, above, by the Supraspmatus ; below by the long head of the Triceps ; behind, by the tendons of the Infraspmatus aM Teres'minor ; and in front, by the tendon of the Subscapidaris.

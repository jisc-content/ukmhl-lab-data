HISTOLOGY 22 Superficial flattened cells it imbibes its nutritive fluids, being itself destitute of blood-vessels. It contains no nerves. Its intimate structure is very simple. If a tliin slice be examined under the microscope, it will bo found to consist of cells of a rounded or bluntly angular form lying in groups of two or more in a granular or almost homogeneous matrix (tig. 27). The cells, when arranged in groups of two or more, have generally straight outlines where they are in contact with each other, and in the rest of theu circumference are rounded.' They consist of clear translucent P^«t«Pl^«™; "J fine iirtcrlacing filaments and minute granules are s^.^^f J^^^'^'^^f,^^ in this are one or two round nuclei, having the usual intranuclear networks Ihe cells are contained in cavities in the matrix, called carttlage lacunar ■ aromid these ?he matrix is arranged in concentric Unes, as if it had been formed in successive portions around the cartilage-cells. This constitutes the so-called caf ule oi the space Each lacuna is generally occupied by a single cell, but during the division of the cells it may contain two, four, or eight cells.

Articular cartilage, costal cartilage, and temporary car- tilage are all of the hyahne variety. They present minute differences in the size and shape of their cells and in the arrangement of their matrices. In articular cartilage (fig. 28), which shows no tendency to ossification, the matrix is finely granular ; the cells and nuclei are small, and are dis- posed parallel to the surface in the superficial part, while nearer to the bone they become vertical.

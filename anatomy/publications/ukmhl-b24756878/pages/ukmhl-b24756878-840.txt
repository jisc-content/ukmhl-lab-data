822 NEUROLOGY In the reticularis alba the longitudinal fibres form two well-defined strands, viz. : (1) the fillet, which lies close to tlie raphe, immediately behind the fibres of the pyramid "; and (2) tlie posterior loncjiludinal fasciculus, wliich is continued upwards from tlie antero-lateral ground bundle of the spinal cord, and, in tlie upper part of the medulla, lies between the fillet and the grey matter m the floor of the fourth ventricle. The longitudinal fibres in the reticularis gi-isea are Fig. 701.- -The formatio reticularis of the medulla, shown by a horizontal section passing through the middle of the oUvary body. (Testut.) 1.

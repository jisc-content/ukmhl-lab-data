The patient at the same time loses, more or less, the power of extending the forearm. The treatment consists m wiring the fragments together ; but if for some reason this operation is not desirable, the fragments .should be approxuuated by strapping or a figure-of-8 bandage, and the arm put uj) m an extended pSsition in order to relax the Triceps. Massage and passive movements must be employed early, for fear of ankylosis. Union, when wirmg is not resorted to, is usually ^''^irfracture of the radius below the insertion of the Biceps, but above the insertion of the Pronator teres, the upper fragment is strongly supinated by the Biceps and Supinator bre\a8, and at the same tune Fxo. 539.-Eracture of the shaft of the radius.

In treating such a fracture the arm must be- put up in a position of supination, other- wise union mil take place mth great impairment of the movements of the hand. In fractures of the radius below the insertion of the Pronator teres (fig. 539), the upper fragment is drawn upwards by the Biceps, and inwards by the Pronator teres, into a position midway between pronation and supmation, and a degree of fuMess in the upper half of the forearm is thus produced. The lower fragment is dra^vn downwards and inwards towards the ulna by the Pronator quadratus, and thro^m into a state of pronation by the same muscle ; at the same time, the Brachio- raS by elevating the styloid process, into which it is uiserted, will serve to depres., tteupper end of the lower fragment still more towards the uhia. In order to relax the oppS muscles the forearm should be bent, and the limb placed m a position midway Ee^ pronation and supination; the fracture is then 7-^ucf b^^^^^^^^ from the vvrist and elbow. Well-padded splints should be appUed on both ^ides of the forearm from the elbow to the wrist ; the hand bemg allowed to faU wdl, '^.Y its own weight co^^^ the action of the Pronator quadratus and Brachio-radialis, and elevate the lower fragment to the level of the upper one. , . .. i „^=;f,•r^„ hnt In fracture of the shaft of the ulna the upper fragment retams its usual position, but the lower fragment is drawn outwards towards the radius by the Pronator quadratus, Fig. 540.—Fracture of the lower end of the radius. of fulness on the dorsal or palmar surfaro of the ^o'^^^^y/"- -^^.^''^^T^.,^ l.eing in a state f ragments are drawn into contact ^> l'-^ ."^IJ'j^^^^^^^ by the of pronation.

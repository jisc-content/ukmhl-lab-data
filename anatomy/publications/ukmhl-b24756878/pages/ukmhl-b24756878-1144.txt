It is then continued over the left Psoas muscle ; it covers the sides and front of the descending colon, and, reaching the abdominal wall, is carried on it to the middle line. (3) In the topper abdomen (fig. 926).—Above the transverse colon the peritoneum can be traced, forming the greater and lesser sacs, and the communication of the two sacs with one another through the foramen of Winslow can be demonstrated. (a) Greater sac.—Commencing on the posterior abdominal Avall at the inferior vena cava, the membrane may be followed to the right over the front of the upper part of the right kidney on to the antero-lateral abdominal wall. From the middle of the anterior wall a backwardly directed fold encircles the obliterated umbilical vein and forms the falciform' ligament of the liver.

' NEUROLOGY numerous fine nerve-fibres. Finally, there is the slralum lernnisci, wliich consists of fibres derived partly from the fiUet and partly from the cells of the stratum op cu.n ; interspersed among these fibres are many large multipo ar nerve- cells The two last-named strata are sometimes termed the grey-wMe Ixnje^ ivom the fact that they consist of both grey and white matter. Of the aftereu fibres which reach the superior quadrigeminal body, some are derived from the fillet but the majority have their origin in the retma and are conveyed to it through the superior brachium ; all of them terminate arbor.smg aroun^^^^^^^^ cells of the grey matter.

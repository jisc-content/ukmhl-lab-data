The latter are similar to the giant- cells (myeloplaxes) found in marrow and they excavate passages through the new-formed bony layer by absorp- tion, and pass through it into the calcified matrix (fig. 40). mereyer these processes come in contact with tlie calcified waUs of tbe primary areolfe they absorb them, and thus cause a fusion of the original caAaties and the formation of larger spaces, which are termed the secondary areolcE (Sharpey) or medullary sfaces (Muller).

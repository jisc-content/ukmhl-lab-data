EMBRYOLOGY 154 which raise themselves from the inner surfaces of the mandibular arches and, blending vnth the tuberculum impar, form the tip and greater portion of the buccal part of the tongue. These lateral growths correspond with similar struc- tures which were described by E. Kallius in the development of the tongue of the lizard From the ventral ends of the fourth arch there arises a second and larger elevation, in the centre of which is a median groove or furrow. Tlus elevation is named the furcula (fig. 203), and is at first separated from the tuberculum impar by a depression, but later by a ridge formed by the forward growth and fusion o the ventral ends of the second and third arches. The posterior or pharyngeal part of the tongue is developed from this ridge, which extends forwards m the form of a V, so as to embrace between its two limbs the tuberculum impar (figs. 204 and 205). At the apex of the V a pit-like invagination occurs to form the nuddle thyroid rudiment, and this depression is represented m the adult by the formmn cJcum of the tongue. In the adult the union of the antenor and posterior parts of the tongue is marked bv a V-shaped depression (sulcus terminahs), the apex of which is at the foramen ci^cum, while the two hmbs run outwards and forwards parallel to, but a httle behind, the circumvallate papiUa^. The pronainent anterior part of the furcula forms the epiglottis ; the furrow behind it is the ^ entrance to the larynx; and tlie Fig 206. — Scheme sho\ving development of branchial epithelial bodies.

The tonsils are developed from the lower parts of the second visceral clefts, immediately behind the anterior pillars of the fauces. The entoderm which lines these clefts grows in the form of a number of solid buds into the surrounding mesoderm. These buds become hollowed out by the de- generation and casting off of their central cells, and by this means the tonsillar crypts are formed. Lymphoid cells accumulate around the crypts, and become grouped to foriin the lymphoid folHcles; the latter, however, are not well defined until after birth.

224 OSTEOLOGY skull, with the infra-temporal crest on the greater wing of the sphenoid. The posterior root, a prolongation of the upper border, is strongly marked ; it runs backwards above tlie external auditory meatus, and is continuous witli the supra-mastoid crest already referred to. At the junction of the anterior root with the zygomatic process is a projection, called the tvherde, for the attachment of the external lateral ligament of the temporo-mandibular joint; and behind the anterior root is an oval depression, forming part of the glenoid fossa,, for the reception of the condyle of the mandible. The glenoid fossa (fossa mandibularis) is bounded, in front, by the eminentia articularis ; beliind, by the tympanic plate which separates it from the external auditory meatus; it is divided into two parts by a narrow slit, the Glaserian fissure (fissura petro- tympanica). The anterior part, formed by the squamous portion of the bone, is smooth, covered in tlie recent state with cartilage, and articulates \^-ith the condyle of the mandible. Behind this part of the fossa is a small conical eixiinence, the post-glenoid process; this is the representative of a prominent Fis. 293.â€”Left temporal bone. Outer surface.

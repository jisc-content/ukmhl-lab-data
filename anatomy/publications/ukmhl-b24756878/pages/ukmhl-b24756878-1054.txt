ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 1036 The cartilage of the pinna (cartilage auriculae) (figs. 854, 855) consists of one single piece; it gives form to this part of the ear, and upon its surface are found all the eminences and depressions above described. It does not enter into tlie construction of all parts of the auricle; thus it docs not form a constituent part of the lobule ; it is deficient, Fig. 855.—The muscles of the pinna. also, between the tragus and beginning of the helix, the gap being filled up by dense fibrous tissue. At the front part of the pinna, where the helix bends upwards, is a small pro- jection of cartilage, called the spina helicis, wlule the lower part of the helix is prolonged downwards as a tail-like pro- cess, the Cauda helicis ; this is separated from the antihelix by a fissure, the fissura antitrago- helicina. The cranial aspect of the cartilage exhibits a trans- verse furrow, the sulcus anii- helicis transversus, which cor- responds with the inferior cnis of the antihelix and separates the prominence produced by the concha from that caused by the fossa triangularis. The eminentia conchas is crossed by a vertical ridge [ponticulus) which gives attachment to the Retrahens auriculam muscle. The cartilage of the pinna presents several intervals or fissures in its substance, which partially separate the different parts The fissure of the helix is a short vertical sUt, situated at the fore- part of the puma. Another fissure, the fissure of the tragus, is seen upon the anterior surface of the tragus. The cartilage of the pinna is of that form which is kno\TO as j^ellow fibro-cartilage. The ligaments of the pinna consist of two sets: (1) extrmsic, connecting it to the side of the head : (2) intrinsic, connecting various parts of its cartilage together. The extrinsic ligaments are two in number, anterior and posterior. The anterior ligament extends from the spma helicis and tragus to the root of the zygoma. The posterior ligament passes from the posterior surface of the concha to the outer surface of the mastoid process of the temporal bone. j ^ j. i • „ „„^^c= frnm The chief intrinsic ligaments are: (a) a strong fibrous band, stretchmg across from the tragus to the commencement of the helix, completing the meatus in front and part y encircling the boundary of the concha ; and (6) a band which extends between t^e antilieUx and the cauda helicis. Other less unportant bands are fomid on the cranial surface of the ^^The muscles of the pinna (fig. 855) consist of two sots : (1) .tb^,,^'"""!;^; jJ^t^nTens* it with the side of the head, movmg the pinna as a ^yhole, V^-"^"^-^.f'^^^^^^^^^^ and Retrahens auriculam (page 450); and (2) the intrinsic, wluch extend from one part ot the auricle to another , VIZ.

The lateral mesodcrra s„lits into two layers, an outer or somatic, which becomes apphed to the inner surface of the ectoderm, and with it forms the somatopleure ; and an inner or Fig. 111.—Section across the dorsal part of a chick embryo of forty-five houi-s'incubation.

(After Eternod ^ THE PRIMITIVE SEGMENTS OR PROTOVERTEBRAL SOMITES Towards the end of the second week the paraxial mesoderm becomes seg- mented and converted into a series of well-defined, more or less cubical areas, the primitive segments or protovertebral somites (figs. 110, 111, and 112), which extend from the occipital region of the head along the entire length of the trunk on either side of the middle line. They lie immediately under the ectoderm on the lateral aspect of the neural tube and notochord, and are con- nected to the lateral mesoderm by the intermediate cell-mass. The cells of each somite encircle a central cavity—the myoccel—which, however, soon becomes filled with angular and spindle-shaped cells. The somites of the trunk may be arranged in the following groups, viz.: cervical 8, thoracic 12, lumbar 5, sacral 5, and coccygeal from 5 to 8. Those of the occipital region of the head are usually described as being four in number. In mammals primitive segments can only be recognised in the occipital region of the head, but a study of the lower vertebrates leads to the belief that they are present also in the anterior part of the head, and that altogether nine segments are represented in the cephaUc region. 7olk-sac Cut edcje of amnion Primitive segments Neural folds Neiirenterit; canal DELIMITATION OF THE EMBRYO As has been pointed out, the margin of the embryonic area is of relatively slow growth, and thus it comes to form a ring of constriction between the embryo and the yolk-sac, and a part of the latter is enclosed within the embryo to form

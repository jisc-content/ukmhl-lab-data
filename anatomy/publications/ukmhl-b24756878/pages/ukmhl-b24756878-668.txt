Sometimes this vessel is wanting, the two arteries joining together to form a single tnmk, which afterwards divides ; or the vessel may be wholly, or partially, divided into two ; frequently it is longer and smaller than Fig. 683.—^The distribution of the middle cerebral artery, (After Charcot.)

The middle cerebral artery (a. cerebri media) (fig. 583), the largest branch of the internal carotid, passes obliquely outwards along the fissure of Sylvius, and divides into its terminal branches opposite the island of Reil. The branches of this vessel are the : Antero-lateral ganglionic. Inferior external frontal. Ascending frontal. The antero-lateral ganglionic branches, a group of small arteries which arise at the commencement of the middle cerebral artery, are arranged m two sets : Ascending parietal. Parieto-temporal. Temporal. Fig. 584.—Outer surface of cerebral hemisphere, sho\nng areas supplied by cerebral arteries.

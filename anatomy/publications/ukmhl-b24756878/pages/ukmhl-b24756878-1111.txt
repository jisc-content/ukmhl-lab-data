The roots of the teeth are firmly implanted within the alveoli; these depres- sions are lined with, periosteum which is reflected on to the tooth at the point of tlie fang, and covers it as far as the neck. At the niargin of the alveolus, the periosteum becomes continuous with the fibrous structure of the gums. Fig. 900.—Permanent teeth of upper jaw, seen from below. F(rramina of Stenaon Horizontal plate of palate bone Accessory palatine canals In consequence of the curve of the dental arch, such terms as anterior, posterior, internal, and external, as applied to the teeth, are misleading and confusing. Special terms are therefore applied to the different surfaces of a tooth : that surface which is directed towards the lips or cheek is known as the labial surface (facies labialis) ; that which is directed towards the tongue is described as the lingual surface (facies lingualis) ; that surface which is directed towards the mesial line, supposing the teeth were arranged in a straight line outwards from the central incisor, is known as the proximal surface ; while that Avhich is directed away from the mesial line is called the distal surface.

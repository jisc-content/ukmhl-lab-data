AJS'GIOLOGY 744 A'ppUed Anatomy.—These emissary veins together with the other communications between the intra- and extra-cranial circulation are of great importance in surgery. Inflammatory processes commencing on the outside of the skull may travel inwards through them, and lead to osteo-phlebitis of the diploe and inflammation of the membranes of the brain. To this in former days was to be attributed one of the principal dangers of wounds of the scalp. By means of these emissary veins blood may be abstracted almost directly from the intracranial circulation—e.g. leeches applied behind the ear di-ain blood almost directly from the lateral sinus, through the mastoid vein. Again, epistaxis in children will frequently relieve severe headache, the blood which flows from the nose being partly derived from the superior longitudinal sinus by means of the vein passing through the foramen caecum. VEINS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY AND THORAX The veins of the upper extremity are divided into two sets, superficial and deep. i .1 • i. l The superficial veins are placed immediately beneath the mtegument between the two layers of superficial fascia.

NEUROLOGY 856 anterior extremity of the hemisphere is named the frontal 'pole.; the posterior, the occipital pole; and the anterior end of the temporal lobe, the temporal pole. About two inches in front of the occipital pole on the infero-latcral border is an indentation or notch, named the pre-occipital notch. The surfaces of the hemispheres are moulded into a number of irregular eminences, named convolutions or ciyri, and these are separated by clefts or furrows, termed fissures or sulci. The fissures are of two kinds, complete and incomplete. The former appear early in foetal life, are few in number, and are produced by infoldings of the entire thickness of the brain-wall, and give rise to corresponding elevations in the interior of the ventricle. They comprise the hippocampal or dentate fissure, and parts of the calcarine and collateral fissures The incomplete fissures are very numerous, and only indent the central white substance, without producmg any corresponding elevations m tlie ventricular cavity. 4. • j-i • The convolutions and their intervenmg fissures are fauiy constant m their arrangement ; at the same time they vary withm certam hmits, not onty m different individuals, but on the two hemispheres of the same brain, ihe convoluted condition of the surface permits of a great mcrease of the grey Fig. 727.—Convolutions and sulci on the external surface of the cerebral hemisphere. matter without the sacrifice of much additional space.

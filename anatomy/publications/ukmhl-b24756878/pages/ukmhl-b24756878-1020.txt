ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 1002 in a single or bifurcated varicose filament, which was formerly supposed to be continuous with the terminal fibril of a nerve ; the investigations of Lenhossek and others would seem to prove, however, that this is not so, but that the nerve-fibrils after losing their medullary sheaths enter the taste-bud, and terminate in fiine extremities between the gustatory cells. Other nerve-fibrils may be seen ramifying between the supporting cells and terminating in fine extremities ; these, however, are believed to be nerves of ordinary sensation and not gustatory. Nerves of taste.—The chorda tympani nerve, derived from the sensory root of the facial, is generally regarded as the nerve of taste for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue ; the nerve for the posterior third is the glosso-pharyngeal. THE NOSE The nose is the peripheral organ of the sense of smell: by means of the peculiar properties of its nerves, it protects the lungs from the inhalation of deleterious gases, and assists the organ of taste in discriminatmg the properties of food. The organ of smell consists of two parts : an external, the outer nose, which projects from the centre of the face ; and an internal, the cavum nasi, which is divided by a septum into right and left nasal fossoe. The outer nose (nasus externus) is pyramidal in form, and its upper angle or root is connected directly with the forehead. Its lase is perforated by two elliptical orifices, the nares, separated from each other by an antero-postenor Fig. 823.—Cartilages of the nose. Side view. Tig. 824.—Cartilages of the nose, seen from below. Lower lateral cartilage Sesamoid cartilages septum, the columna. The margms of the nares are provided with a number of stiff hairs, or vibrissce, which arrest the passage of foreign substances carried with the current of air m- tended for respiration. The lateral surfaces of the nose form, by their union m the middle line, the dorsum nasi, the direction of which varies considerably in different individuals ; the upper part of the dorsum is sii])ported by the nasal bones, and is named the bridge.

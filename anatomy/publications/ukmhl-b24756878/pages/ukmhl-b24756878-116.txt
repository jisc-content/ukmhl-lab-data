The interglandular tissue is also increased in quantity, and is crowded with large round, oval, or pol3^gonal cells, termed decidual cells. These changes are well advanced by the second month of pregnancy, when the mucous membrane consists of the following strata (fig. 122) : (1) stratum compaclmn, next the free surface ; in this the uterine glands are only slightly expanded, and are lined by columnai cells; (2) slratum spongiosum, in'which the gland tubes are greatly dilated and very' tortuous, and ultimately come to be separated by only a small amount of interglandular tissue, while their lining cells are flattened or cubical; (3) a thni unaltered layer, next the uterine muscular fibres, containing the deepest parts of the uterine glands, which are not dilated, and are lined with columnar epithelium : it is from this epithelium that the epithelial fining of the uterus is regenerated Fig 123 —Section through ovum imbedded in the uterine decidua.

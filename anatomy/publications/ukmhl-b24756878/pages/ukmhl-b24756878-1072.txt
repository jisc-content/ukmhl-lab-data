A canal is thus shut off between the scala tympani below and the scala vestibuli above ; this is the membranous canal of the cochlea, ductus cochlearis. or scala media. It is triangular on transverse section, its roof being formed by the membrane of Reissner, its outer wall by the periosteum which lines the bony canal, and Fig. 870.—Floor of scala media, showing the organ of CJorti, &c. its floor by the membrana basilaris and the outer part of the lamina spiralis ossea. On the membrana basilaris is placed the organ of Corti. Reissner's membrane is thin and homogeneous, and is covered on its uxDper and \mder surfaces by a layer of epithelium. The periosteum, supporting the outer wall of the ductus cochlearis, is greatly thickened and altered in character, forming what is called the ligamentum spirale. It projects inwards below as a triangular Fig. 871.—The lamina reticularis and subjacent structures. (Schematic.) (Testut.) I.ten,a,pmarofCorti.with„,itsp,ato^ E Inner liuir-cplls. 1, 1'.

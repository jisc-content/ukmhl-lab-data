634 AA^GIOLOGY hromorrhago from the lips, the result either of an accidental wound or during an operation ; but its application is useless, except for a very sliort time, on account of the free communication of this vessel witli its fellow, and with numerous branches from diflerent sources. In a woimd involving the lip, it is better to seize the part between the fingers, and evert it, when the bleeding vessel may be at once secured with pressure-forceps. In order to prevent hajmorrhage in cases of removal of growths from tiic ]mrt, the lip should bo compressed on either side between the fingers and thumb, or by a pair of specially devised clamp-forceps, while the surgeon excises the diseased part. In order to stop hemorrhage when the lip has been divided in an operation, it is necessary, in uniting the edges of the womid, to pass the sutures through the cut edges, almost a.s deep as its mucous surface ; by these means, not only are the cut surfaces more neatly and securely adapted to each otlier, but the possibility of ha3morrhage is prevented by including in the suture the divided artery. If, on the contrary, the suture be passed through merely the cutaneous portion of the wound, hemorrhage occurs into the cavity ot the mouth. The student should, lastly, observe the relation of the angular artery to the lachrymal sac ; as the vessel passes up along the inner margin of the orbit, it ascends on the nasal side of the sac. In operating for fistula lacrimaUs, the sac should always be opened on its outer side, in order that this vessel may be avoided. 4. The occipital artery (a. occipitalis) (fig. 576) arises from the posterior part of the external carotid, opposite the facial, near the lower margin ot the posterior belly of the Digastric, and terminates in the posterior part ot the ^^^Relations.—At its origm, it is covered by the posterior helly of the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid, and the hypoglossal nerve winds aroimd it from behind iorwards , higher up, it crosses the internal carotid artery, the mternal jugular vem and the pneumogastric and spinal accessory nerves.

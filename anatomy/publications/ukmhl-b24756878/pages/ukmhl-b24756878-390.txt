Liqamentous Action of Muscles.—The movements of the different joints ot a limb are combined bv means of the long muscles passing over more than one ioiut These, when relaxed and stretched to their greatest extent, act as elastic Uo-aments in restraining certain movements of one joint, except when combined°with corresponding movements of the other-the latter movements hem<y usually in the opposite direction. Thus the shortness of the hamstring muscles prevents complete flexion of the Hp, unless the knee-pint is also flexed so as to bring their attachments nearer together. The uses o tlus arrangement are threefold. 1. It co-ordinates the kinds of movements which are the most habitual and necessary, and enables them to be performed with the least expendi- ture of power. ' Thus in the usual gesture of the arms, whether in grasping or reiectmg^ the shoulder and the elbow are flexed simultaneously, and simultane- ously extended,' in consequence of the passage of the Biceps and Triceps over both ioints. 2. It enables the short muscles which pass over only one joint to act upon more than one. ' Thus, if the Rectus femoris remain toiucal y of such length that when, stretched over the extended hip, it compels ex ension of the knee then the Gluteus maximus becomes, not only an extensor of the hip but an extensor of the knee as well.' 3.

307 RADIUS Fig. 361.—Plan of ossification of the raclius. Prom three centres. Head Appears at fifth year ~ Unites loith shaft about puberty convex and covered by the tendons of tlie muscles vvliich subsequently run in the grooves on the lower end of the bone. The external surface (facies lateralis) is round and convex throughout its entire extent. Its upper third gives insertion to the Supinator brevis. About its centre is seen a rough ridge, for the insertion of the Pronator teres. Its lower part is narrow, and covered by the tendons of tlie Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and Extensor brevis jjoUicis. The lower extremity is large, of quadrilateral form, and provided witli two iirticular surfaces—one on the inferior surface, for articulation with the cai-pus, and another at the inner side, for articulation with the ulna. The carpal articular surface is triangular, concave, smooth, and divided by a sliglit antero-posterior ridge into two parts. Of these, the external, triangular, articu- lates « ith the scaphoid bone ; the inner, quadrilateral, witli the semilunar. The articular surface for the ulna is called the sigmoid cavity (incisura ulnaris) of the radius ; it is narrow, concave, smooth, and articulates with the head of the ulna. These two articular surfaces are separated from each other by a prominent ridge, to which the base of the triangular fibro-cartilage is attached; this structure separates the wrist-joint from the inferior radio-ulnar articula- tion. This end of the bone presents three non-articular surfaces—anterior, posterior, and external. The anterior surface, rough and irregular, affords attachment to the anterior ligament of the m-ist-joint. The posterior surface is convex, affords attachment to the pos- terior ligament of the wist-joint, and is marked by three grooves. Enumerated from without inwards, the first groove is broad, but shallow, and subdivided into two by a slight ridge : the outer of these two transmits the tendon of the Extensor carpi radialis longior, the iimer the tendon of the Extensor carpi radiahs brevior. The second, near the centre of the bone, is a deep but narrow groove, bounded on its outer side by a sharply defined ridge ; it is directed obhquely from above, downwards and outwards, and transmits the tendon of the Ex- tensor longus pollicis. The third and most internal is broad, for the passage of the tendons of the Extensor indicis and Extensor communis digitorum. The external surface is prolonged ob- hquely downwards into a strong, conical projection, the styloid process (processus styloideus), which gives attachment t)y Its base to the tendon of the Brachio-radialis, and by its apex to the external lateral hgament of the wrist-joint.

STRUCTURE OP THE CEREBRAL CORTEX 881 Baillarger) ; (6) a third grey layer, which rests on the medullary substance of the convolution. Tlie cortex is made up of nerve-cells which vary in size and shape, and of nerve-fibres which are either medullated or naked axis-cylinders, imbedded in a matrix of neuroglia. Nerve-cells.—According to Cajal, whose description is now generally accepted, the nerve-cells are arranged m four layers, named from tlie surface inwards as follows ; (1) the molecular layer, (2) the layer of small pyramidal cells, (3) the layer of large pyramidal cells, (4) the layer of polymorphous cells. The molecular layer.—In this layer the cells are polygonal, triangular, or fusiform in sliape. Each polygonal cell gives off some four or five dendrites," while its axon may arise directly from the cell or from one of its dendi-ites.' The axons and dendrites of these cells ramify in the molecular layer. Each triangular cell gives off two or three dendrites, from one of which the axon arises, the dendrites and the axon ramifying in the molecular layer. Tlie fusiform cells are placed with their long axes parallel to the surface and are mostly bipolar, each pole being prolonged into a dendrite, which runs horizon- tally for some distance and furnishes ascending branches. Their axons, two or tlu-ee m number, arise from the dendrites, and, hke them, take a horizontal course, giving off numerous ascending collaterals. The distribution of the axons and dendrites of aU three sets of cells is limited to the molecular layer The layer of small and the layer of large pyramidal cells.—The"'celis in these two layers may be studied together, since, witJi the exception of the difference m size and the more superficial position of the smaller cells they resemble each other. The average length of the small cells is from 10 to'l5 a'- that of the large cells from 20 to 30 /x. The body of each cell is pyi-amidal in shape. Its base bemg directed to the deeper parts and its apex towards the surface. It contains granular pigment, and stams deeply with ordinary reagents. The nucleus is nucleolated, of large size, and round or oval in shape. 1 he base of the cell gives off the axis-cyhnder, and this passes into the central white substance, gmng off collaterals in its course, and is distributed as a pro- jection commissural, or association fibre. Both the apical and basal parts of the cell give off dendi-ites. The apical dendiite is directed towards the surface and ends m the molecular layer by dividing into numerous branches, all of which may be seen, when prepared by the silver or methylene-blue method, to be studded with projecting bristle-hke processes. The largest pyi-amidal cells are ound m the upper part of the precentral gyrus and m the paracentral lobule. These, which are often arranged in groups or nests of from tlu-ee to ' ^'"L"'™'^,^ giant-cells of Beiz. In the former situation they may exceed 50 in length and 40 /. in breadth, while m the paracentral lobule they may attain a length of 65 •'^ . Layer of polymorphous cells.—The cells in this layer, as theii- name implies, are very irregular m contour ; they may be fusiform, oval, triangular, oi s ai--shaped. Theu- dendi-ites are directed outwards, towards, but do not leach the molecular layer ; their axons pass into the subjacent white matter. r..J - r t-™ °* the cerebral cortex, but theii- axons pass m a direction opposite to that of the pyramidal and polymorphous cells T medullated, but divide, immediately after their origins, into a 6 ^tir.?/fuT^^f- ^^'^ '^'■'^'^"^ of "the cortex ; (6) t\m cells o Martinoth, ^yhloh are chiefly found in the polymorphous layer Se t'^t^l'J"^ short, and may have an aseendmg or dScending course cells^wf",!l^!^^f-~^''?'u?^''l' ^^'^^ P''^^*^ of the mtervals between the avnn. n ll, n °^ed"l^'^ted or non-meduUated-tlie latter comprising the the fib, o n^i''*^ pyramidal cells and the cells of Golgi.

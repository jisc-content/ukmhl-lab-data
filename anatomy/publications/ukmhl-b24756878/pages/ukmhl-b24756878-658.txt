640 ANGIOLOGY ^ Inferior rectus and Inferior oblique muscles and the lachrymal gland, and (b) anterior denial branches (aa. alveol. superiores anteriores) which descend through the anterior dental canals in the bone to supply the mucous membrane of the antrum and the front teeth of the maxilla. On the face, some branches pass upwards to the mneu angle of the orbit and the lachrymal sac, anastomosing with the angular branch of the facial artery ; others run inwards towards the nose, anastomosmg with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic; and others descend beneath the Levator labu superioris and anastomose with the transverse facial and buccal arteries. The four remaining branches arise from that portion of the internal maxillary which is contained in the spheno-maxillary fossa. The descending palatine (a. palatina descendens) descends through the posterior palatine canal with the anterior palatine branch of Meckel's ganglion, and, emergiu" from the posterior palatine foramen, runs forwards m a groove on the inner-side of the alveolar border of the hard palate to the anterior palatine canal. The terminal branch of the artery passes upwards through the foramen of Stenson to anastomose witb the naso-palatine artery Branches are distributed to the gums the mucous membrane of the hard palate, and the palatme glands. In the pklatine canal it gives off branches which descend m the accessory palatine canals to supply the soft palate and tonsU. anastomosmg with the ascending palatine artery. Avvlied Anatomy.-The position of the descending palatme artery on the hard palate should be bOTne in muxd in performing an operation for the closure of a c oft m the hard nahte as itTL danger of being wotmded, and may give rise to formidable haemoiThage ; ft il evL been found necessary to plug the posterior palatme canal m order to arrest the bleeding. The Vidian (a. canalis pterygoidei) passes backwards along the Vidian canal with the Vidian nerve. It is distributed to the upper part o the pharynx Ind to the Eustachian tube, sending iiato the tympanum a smaU branch which palatt^caS w'ith the 'pbaryigeal nerve, and is distributed to the upper part of tVip nharvnx and to the Eustachian tube. The snheno-palatine (a. sphenopalatina) passes through the spheno-palatme bTi^hll t^foH* *L nSer ar, districted to the lateral wall of the nose, the antrum, and the ethmoidal and sphenoidal eells.

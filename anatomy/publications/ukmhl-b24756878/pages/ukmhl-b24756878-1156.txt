1138 SPLANCHNOLOGY membrano o£ the stoniacli, the tubes with shorter and more cubical cells which are finely irranular. The curdiiic glands (fig. 939) are found all over the surface of the stomach, ljut occiu- most numerously "at the cardiac end. Like the pyloric glands they consist of a duct, into which open two or more closed tubes. The duct, however, in these glands is shorter than in the other variety, sometimes not amounting to more than one-sixth of the whole length of the gland; it is lined throughout by columnar epithelium. At the point where the terminal tubes open into the duct, and wliich is termed the neck, the epithehmn alters, and consists of short columnar or polyhedral, granular cells, which almost till the tube, so that the lumen becomes suddenly constricted, and is continued down as a very ime channel They are known as the chief or central cells of the glands. Between these cells and the basement-membrane, larger oval cells, which stain deeply with eosm, are found ; these cells are studded throughout the tube at intervals, giving it a beaded or varicose appearance. These are known as the parietal or oxyntic cells. Between the glands the mucous membrane consists of a connective-tissue framework, with lymphoid tLssue. in places, this latter tissue, especially in early life, is collected into little masses, which to a certain extent resemble the solitary glands of the intestine, and are termed the lenhcuhr elands of the stomach. They are not, however, so distinctly circumscribed as the solitary alands. Beneath the mucous membrane, and between it and the submucous coat, is a thin stratum of involuntary muscular fibre {muscularis mucosm), which in some parts consists only of a single longitudinal layer; in others of two layers, an inner circular, and an outer longitudinal. , . • it. i ■„ Vessels and Nerves.—The arteries supplying the stomach are : the gastric, the pyloric and right gastro-epiploic branches of the hepatic, the left gastro-epiploic and vasa brevia from the splenic. They supply the muscular coat, ramify in the submucous coat, and aie^mally distributed to the mucous membrane. The arrangement of the vessels m the mucous membrane is somewhat peculiar. The arteries break up at the base of the gastric ?ibulesinto a plexus of fine capillaries which run upwards between the t^^ules anastomos- ing with each other, and ending in a plexus of larger capillaries, winch t^'^.^^^^^ of the tubes and also form hexasonal meshes around the alveoli.

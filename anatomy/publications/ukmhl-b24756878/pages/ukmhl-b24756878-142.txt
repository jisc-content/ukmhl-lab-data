124 EMBRYOLOGY dependent part of the diverticulum becomes solid and forms the postenor lobe of the pituitary body; the anterior lobe of this body is developed from a diverticulum of the ectodermal lining of the stomatodaeum (page 155). The optic commissure is developed by the meeting and partial decussation of the optic nerves, which subsequently grow backwards as the optic tracts and ternunate in the diencephalon. . j- x- i r The cerebral hemispheres.—As already stated, these anse as diverticula ot the alar laminfe of the telencephalon (figs. 154 to 157); they mcrease rapidly m size and ultimately overlap the parts which are developed from the mid- and hind-brains. This great expansion of the hemispheres is a charac- teristic feature of the brains of mammals, and attains its maximum develop- ment in the brain of man. ElHot-Smith divides each cerebral hemisphere into three fundamental parts, viz. : the rhinencephalon, the corpus striatum, and the neopallium^ (figs. 154, 156) represents the oldest part of the telencephalon, and forms almost the whole of the hemisphere m fishes, amphibians, and reptiles.

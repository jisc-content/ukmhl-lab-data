Occasionally the first tendon is connected to the second by a thin transverse band. The Extensor minimi digiti (m. extensor digiti quinti proprius) is a slender muscle placed on the inner side of the Extensor communis, witii which it is generally connected. It arises from the common Extensor tendon by a thin tendinous slip; and from the inter- muscular septa between it and Fig. 525.â€”Supinator brevis. (From a prepara- the adjacent muscles.

The Extensor carpi ulnaris is the most superficial muscle on the vdnar side of the foreann. It arises from the external epi- condyle of the humerus, by the common tendon; by an apo- neiu'osis from the posterior bor- der of the ulna in common with the Flexor carpi ulnaiis and the Flexor profundus digitorum; and from the deep fascia of the fore- arm. This muscle terminates in a tendon, which runs through a groove behind the styloid process of the ulna, passing through a separate compartment in the an- nular ligament, and is inserted into the prominent tubercle on the ulnar side of tlie base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. The Anconeus is a small tri- angular muscle, placed on the back of the elbow-joint, and appears to be a continuation of the ex- ternal portion of the Triceps. It arises by a separate tendon from the back part of the external epicondyle of the humenis, and is inserted into the side of the olecranon, and upper foui-th of tlie posterior surface of the shaft ot the ulna ; its fibres diverge from their origin, the upper ones being directed transversely, the lower obliquely inwards.

The Supinator brevis (m. supmator) (fig. 525) is a broad muscle, of a nouow cylmdi-ical form, curved round the upper thii-d of the radius. It consists ot two distinct planes of muscular fibres, between which the posterior mterosseous nerve lies. The two planes arise in common, the superficial one by tendinous, and the deeper by muscular fibres: from the external epicondyle of the humerus ; from the external lateral ligament of the elbow- joint, and the orbicular ligament; from the ridge on the ulna, which runs ODiiquely downwards from the posterior extremity of tlie lesser sigmoid cavity ; N N 2

07U ANGIOLOGY vessel may thus be conveniently divided into three parts, viz. in the forearm, at the back of the wrist, and in the hand. Relations.—(a) hi the forearm the artery extends from opposite the neck of the radius to the fore part of the styloid process, being placed to the inner side of the shaft above, and in front of it below. It is overlapped in the upper part of its course by the fleshy belly of the Bracbio-radiahs muscle ; throughout the rest of its course it is superficial, being covered by the integument and the superficial and deep fasciae. In its course downwards, it hes upon the tendon of the Biceps, the Supinator brevis, the Pronator teres, the radial origin of the Flexor subhmis digitorum, the Flexor longus polhcis, the Pronator quadratus, and the lower extremity of the radius. In the upper third of its course it lies between the Brachio-radiahs and the Pronator teres ; in its lower two-thirds, between the tendons of the Brachio-radiahs and Flexor carpi radiahs. The radial nerve hes close to the outer side of the artery in the middle third of its course ; and some filaments of the musculo-cutaneous nerve, after piercing the deep fascia, run along the lower part of the artery as it winds round the wrist. The vessel is accompanied by veniE comites throughout its whole course. (6) At the wrist as it Avinds round the outer side of the carpus, from the styloid process to the first interosseous space, it hes upon the external lateral ligament, and then upon the scaphoid and trapezium, bemg covered by the Extensor tendons of the thumb, subcutaneous veins, some filaments of the radial nerve, and the integument. It is accompanied by two veins, and a filament of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. (c) In the hand, it passes from the upper end of the first interosseous space, between the heads of the Abductor indicis or First dorsal interosseous muscle, transversely across the palm, to the base of the metacarpal bone of the httle finger, where it anastomoses with the deep branch from the ulnar artery, completing the deef palmar arch (arcus volaris profundus). It hes upon the carpal extremities of the metacarpal bones and the Interossei, being covered by the Adductor obhquus polhcis, the flexor tendons of the fingers, and the Lumbricales. Alongside of it, but riuining in the opposite direction—that is to say, from vnthm outwards—is the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. Peculiarities.—The origin of the radial artery, according to Quam, is, in nearly one case m eight, higher than usual; more often it arises from the axiUary or upper part of the brachial, than from the lower part of the latter vessel. In the forearm it deviates less frequently from its normal position than the ulnar. It has been found lying on the deep fascia instead of beneath it. It has also been observed on the surface of the Brachio-radaahs, instead of under its inner border ; and in turning round the vaist, it has been seen lymg on, instead of beneath, the Extensor tendons of the thumb. • Surface Marking.—The position of the radial artery in the forearm is represented bv a line drawn from the outer border of the tendon of the Biceps m the centre of the hollow m front of the elbow-jomt to the mner side of the fore part of the styloid process of the radius, with the hmb m the position of supination. . . , .1 • j Applied Anatomy.—The radial artery is much exposed to m]ury m its lower tmrd. and is frequently wounded by the hand being driven through a pane of glass by the slipping of a knife or chisel held in the other hand, &c. The injury may be f oUowed by a traumatic aneurysm, for which the operation of laymg open the sac and securing the vessel above and below is required. . , ... , The operation of tying the radial artery is required in cases of wounds either ot its trunk, or of some of its branches, or for aneurysm: and the vessel may be esi>osed m any part of its course through the forearm without the division of any muscular fibres, the operation in the middle or inferior third of the forearm is easily performed; but 1? t,he upper third, near the elbow, it is attended Mith some difficulty from the greater depth of the vessel, and from its being overlapped by the Brachio-radiahs To tie the artery in the up]>er third, an incision three inches in length f^^o^ ^^^f.^^^J^ through the integument, in a Une drawn from the centre of the bend of *e o^bow to the front of the styloid process of the radius, avoiding the branches of t^e medmn em the fascia of the ^rm being divided, and the BrachK)-rad.al.s drawn ^J'^'^ artery will be exposed.

ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 1042 The canal for the Tensor tympani (semicanalis m. tensoris tyinpani) is the superior and "the smaller of the two ; it is eylindrlcal and lies beneath the forward prolongation of the tegmen tympani. It extends on to the inner wall of the tynipanum and ends immediately above the fenestra ovalis. The processus coclileariformis passes backwards below this part of the canal, forming its outer wall and floor ; it expands above the anterior extremity of the fenestra ovalis and terminates by curving outwards so as to form a pulley over which the tendon passes. The Eustachian tube (tuba auditiva) is the channel through Avhich the tympanum communicates with the naso-pharynx. Its length is an inch and a half (36 mm.), and its direction is downwards, forwards, and inwards, forming an angle of about forty-five degrees with the sagittal plane and one of from thirty to forty degrees with the ^G. 859.-The membrana tympani viewed horizontal plane. It is formed part ly fromwitliin. (Testut.) of bone, partly of cartilage and fibrous tissue. The osseous fortion (pars ossea tubse auditivse) is about half an inch in length. It commences in the anterior wall of the tympanum, below the processus cochleariformis, and, gradually narrowing, terminates at the angle of junction of the petrous and squamous portions of the tem- poral bone, its extremity presenting a jagged margin which serves for the attachment of the cartilaguious portion. The cartilaginous portion (pars cartilaginea tubse auditivae), about an inch in length, is formed of a triangular plate of elastic fibro- cartilage, the apex of which is attached to the margin of the inner extremity of the osseous canal, wliile its base lies directly under the mucous membrane of the naso- pharynx, where it forms an eleva- tion or cushion behind the pharyn- geal orifice of the tube. The upper edge of the cartilage is curled upon itself, being bent out^\ards so as to present on'' transverse section the appearance of a hook ; a groove or furrow is thus produced, which opens below and externally, and this part of the canal is completed by fibrous membrane. The cartilage lies m a The malleus has been resected imme(3iately beyond its processus brevis, in order to show the malleolar folds and the membrane of Shrapnell. 1. Membrana tjTnpani. 2.

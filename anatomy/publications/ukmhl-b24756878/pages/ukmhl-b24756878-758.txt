ANUIOLUGY 740 of the temporal bone, and is situated, in this part of its course, m the attached marcrin of the tentorium cerebelli ; it tlien leaves the tentorium and curves downwards and inwards to reach the jugular foramen, where it terminates in the internal jugular vein. In its course it rests upon the inner surface of the occipital, the postero-inferior angle of tlie parietal the mastoid portion of the temporal, and on the occipital, agam, just before its termination. The portion of the sinus which occupies the groove on the mastoid part of the temporal is known as the sigmoid sinus. The lateral smuses are frequently of unequal size, that formed by the superior longitudinal sinus being the larger; Jhey ^ncreas; in size as they proceed from behind forwai;ds. The horizontal portion is of a prismatic form, the curved portion semicylindrical. The inner Lrfaces are smooth, and not crossed by the fibrous bands fo^^d^^.the other sinuses They receive the blood from the superior petrosal smuses at the base of ihe petrouJportion of the temporal bone; they communicate with the veins of the pericranium by means of the mastoid and condyloid emissary veins , and thev ieceive some of the inferior cerebral and inferior cerebellar veins, and some veinl from the diploe. The petrosquamous .m«., when present runs backwards along the junction of the petrous and squamous portions of Se oiamen iSSn by several smaU veins, one of which joms the termmatioi ortlie Sal bSus ; i^^ communicates with the posterior spmal veins, and Xti'^^^^^^^^^^ of (oonfluens sinuum) is an? ^ connecred across the middle line .dth the commencement of the lateral sinus of the opposite side. .

On tlie inner wall of each sinus is the internal carotid artery, accompanied by filaments of tlie carotid plexus and by the sixth nerve ; and on tlie outer wall, the third and fourth nerves, and the ophthalmic and superior maxillary divisions of the fifth nerve (fig.

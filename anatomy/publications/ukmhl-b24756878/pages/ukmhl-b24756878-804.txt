786 ANGIOLOGY The lymphatic vessels of the liver are divisible into two sets, superficial and deep The former arise "in the subperitoneal areolar tissue over the entire surface of the organ, and may be grouped into : (a) those on the convex surface, (b) those on the inferior surface. ^ , . t ^i,- t (a) On tlie convex surface.—The vessels trom the back part of this surface reach their terminal glands by three different routes : the vessels of the middle set five or six in number, pass through the caval openmg m the Diaphragm and end in one or two glands which are situated around the terminal part of the inferior vena cava ; a few vessels from the left side pass backwards towards the oesophageal opening, and terminate in the paracardial glands of the coronary chain ; the vessels from the right side, one or two m number run on the abdominal surface of the Diaphragm, and, after crossing its right crus, terminate in the pre-aortic glands which surround the origm of the ccelikc axis. From the portions of the right and left lobes adjacent to the falciform ligament, the lymphatic vessels converge to form two trunks, one of Fig. 667.—Lymphatics of the bladder. (Cuneo and Marcille.)

830 NEUROLOGY Internal Steucttjre of the Cerebellum The cerebeUum consists of white and grey matter. White matter.-If a sagittal section (fig. 706) be made through either hemisphere, the interior will be found to consist of a central stem of white mXf in the interior of which is a grey mass, the nucleus dentatus From IS surface of this central stem a series of plates of medullary matter are detached; these are covered with grey matter and form the laminaj In coSeq^^^^^^^ of the main branches from the central stem dividmg and sub- Shig! the section presents a characteristic appearance, which ]^^^^^^^^^ arbm- vi m If the sagittal section be made through the middle of the vermis it w 11 be found that the central stem divides mto a vertical and a horizontal brai^ch The\er^*caZ branch passes upwards to the culmen, where it subdivides freely one of its ramifications passing forwards and upwards Fia. 706.-Sagittal section of the cerebellum, near the point of jimction of the vermis ^ with the hemisphere.

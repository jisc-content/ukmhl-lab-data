EMBRYOLOGY 160 Further changes take place in the bursa omentalis and in the common mesentery, and give rise to the peritoneal relations seen in the adult. The bursa omentalis, which at first reaches only as far as the greater curvature of the stomach, grows downwards to form the great omentum, and this downward extension fies in front of the transverse colon and the coils of the small intestine. The anterior layer of the transverse mesocolon is at first quite distinct from the Fig. 214.—Section through same region as in fig. 213, at end of third month. (Toldt.) Liver Stomach Lesser omentuvi Liver iglit suprarenal capsule Left suprarenal capsule posterior layer of the great omentum, but ultimately the two blend, and hence the great omentum appears as if attached to the transverse colon (fig. 216). The mesenteries of the ascending and descending parts of the colon disappear in the majority of cases, while that of the small intestine assumes the oblique attachment characteristic of its adult condition.

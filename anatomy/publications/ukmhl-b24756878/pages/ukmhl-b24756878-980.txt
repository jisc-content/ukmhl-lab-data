962 NEUROLOGY In the palm of the hand, the median nerve is covered by the integument and palmar fascia, and crossed by the superficial palmar arch. It rests upon the tendons of the Flexor muscles. In this situation it becomes enlarged, somewhat flattened, of a reddish colour, and divides into two branches. Of these, the external supplies a muscular branch to some of the muscles of the thumb, and diaital branches to the thumb and radial side of the index finger ; the internal supplies digital branches to the contiguous sides of the index and middle, and of the middle and ring fingers. , . , t -j ^ i The branch to the muscles of the thumb is a short nerve, which divides to supply the Abductor, the Opponens, and the superficial head of the Flexor brevis poUicis ; the remaining muscles of this group are supplied by the uMar nerve The digital branches are five in number. The first and second pass along the borders of the thumb, the external branch communicating with branches ot tlie radial nerve. The third passes along the radial side of the index finger, and crives a filament to the First lumbrical. The fourth subdivides to supply the adjacent sides of the index and middle fingers, and sends a branch to the Second lumbrical. The fifth supplies the adjacent sides of the middle and ring fangers, and communicates with a branch from the ulnar nerve. . ^ i Each digital nerve, opposite the base of the first phalanx, gives off a dorsal branch, which joins the dorsal digital nerve from the radial, and runs along the side of the dorsum of the finger, to end in the integument over the last phalanx At the end of the finger, the digital nerve divides into a palmar and a doisai branch, the former of which supplies the extremity of the finger, and the lattei ramies round and beneath the nail. The digital nerves, as they nm along the fingers, are placed superficial to the digital arteries. _ The ulnSr (n. ulnaris) (fig. 801) is placed along the inner or ulnar side of the upper limb, and is distributed to the muscles and mtegument of the forearm aS hand It arises from the inner cord of the brachial plexus, m commSi wSh the inner head of the median and the internal cutaneous nerve and derives its fibres from the eighth cervical and first tiioracic nerves It Smaller than the median, and lies at first behind it, but diverges from 11 m its course down the arm.

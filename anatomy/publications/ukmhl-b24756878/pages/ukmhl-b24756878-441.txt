INTERPHALANGEAL ARTICULATIONS 423 XI. INTERPHALANGEAL ARTICULATIONS (ARTICULATIONES DIGITORUM MANUS) These are hinge joints. The ligaments are : Anterior. Two Lateral. The arrangement of these ligaments is similar to those m the metacarpo- phalangeal articulations. The Extensor tendon supplies the place of a posterior ligament. Movements.—The only movements permitted in the phalangeal joints are flexion and extension ; these movements are more extensive between the first and second phalanges than between the second and third. The amount of flexion is very considerable, but extension is limited by the anterior and lateral ligaments. Muscles Acting on the Joints of the Digits Flexion of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints of the fingers is effected by the Flexores subHmis et profundus digitonim, Lumbricales, and Interossei, assisted in the case of the Uttle finger by the Flexor brevis minimi digiti. Extension of these joints is produced by the Extensor commum's digitorum, Extensor indicis and Extensor minimi digiti. Flexion of the interphalangeal joints of the fingers is accompUshed by the Flexor profimdus digitorum acting on the first and second joints and by the Flexor subhmis digitorum acting on the fiirst joints. Extension is effected mainly by the Lumbricales and Interossei, the long Extensors having Uttle or no action upon these joints. Flexion of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint of the thumb is effected by the Flexores longus et brevis poIUcis : extension by the Extensores longus et brevis pollicis. Flexion of the interphalangeal joint is accomplished by the Flexor longus pollicis and extension by the Extensor longus polUcis. Surface Form.—TYxa prominences of the knuckles do not correspond to the position of the joints either of the metacarpo-phalangeal or interphalangeal articulations. These prommences are invariably formed by the distal ends of the proximal bone of each joint, and the fine mdicating the position of the joint must be sought considerably m front of the middle of the knuckle. ARTICULATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY The articulations of the Lower Extremity comprise the following : I- Hip. V. Intertarsal. II. Knee. VI. Tarso-metatarsal. III. Tibio-fibular. VII. Intermetatarsal. IV. Ankle. VIII. Metatarso-phalangeal. IX. Interphalangeal. I.

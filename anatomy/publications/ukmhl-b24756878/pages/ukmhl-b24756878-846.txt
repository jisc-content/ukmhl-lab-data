828 NEUROLOGY lobes ; but the arrangement is more complicated, and the relation of the segments of the vermis to those of the hemispliere is less clearly marked. This smiace is divided into four lobes by three main fissures, whicli, however, are not so regularly disposed as those on the upper surface. The lobes on the vermis are named from before backwards: (1) the nodule, (2) the uvula, (3) the pyramid, and (4) the tuber valvulce or tuber posticum. On the hemispheres the corresponding lobes are: (1) the flocculus, {2) the amygdala j^) biventral or digastric lobe, and (4) the postero-tnfenor lobe ^^^f \ ^^Ty at least two-thirds of the under surface and is «^^J>dYided bj^ a fissure named the vostqracile fissure ; the anterior of the t^vo subdivisions is named ^Tdenderhbe (lobus gmciUs) ; and the posterior, the ^nfer^or semduna, Fig. 705.-Diacrram showing fissures on under sui-face of the cerebellum.

1122 SPLANCKNOLOGY The parietal portion is loosely connected witli the fascial lining of tlie abdomen and pelvis, but is more closely adherent to the under surface of tlie Diaphragm and also in the middle line of the abdomen. The space between the parietal and visceral layers of the peritoneum is named the peritoneal cavity ; but it must be remembered that under normal conditions tliis cavity is a potential one, since the parietal and visceral layers are in contact. The peritoneal ' cavity ' is subdivided into a greater and a lesser sac, which communicate through the foramen of VVinslow (foramen epiploicum). The greater sac is opened when the abdominal wall Ls cut through ; tlie lesser is situated behind the stomach and adjoining structures, and may be regarded as a diverticulum from the greater sac. The"peritoneum differs from the other serous membranes of the body in presenting a mucli more complex arrangement, and one which can only be clearly understood by foUo^^dng the changes which take place in the alimentary Fig. 923.—Vertical disposition of the peritoneum.

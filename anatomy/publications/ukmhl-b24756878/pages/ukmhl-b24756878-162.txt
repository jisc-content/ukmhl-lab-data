144 EMBRYOLOGY The subclavian artery is prolonged into the limb under the names of the axillary •ind brachial arteries, and these together constitute the arterial stem for the upper arm. The direct continuation ol this stem in the forearm forms the anterior interosseous artery ; while the radial and ulnar vessels, which ultmiately exceed this artery in size, are in reality lateral branches of the mam stem. The formation of the primary caudal arches has already been referred to fnaee 136) and the fusion of the dorsal aortse to form the greater part of the sVstemic aorta has been pointed out (page 135). The middle sacra artery of the adult was formerly regarded as the direct contmuation of the adult aorta, but Youn" and Eobinson (op. cit.) maintain that it ' is a secondary branch, probably i^epresenting fused segmental arteries.' They have also pointed out that while the dorsal and ventral extremities of the primary caudal arches remain, their middle portions ' disappear and are replaced by " secondary caudal arches Vir 102—Human embryo with heart and anterior body wall removed to show the sini!\emZ lnd its\ributarie8.

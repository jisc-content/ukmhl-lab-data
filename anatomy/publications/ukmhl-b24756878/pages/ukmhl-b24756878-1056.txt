ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE; 1038 a half in length if measured from the tragus; from the bottom of the concha its length is about an inch. It forms a sort of S-shaped curve, and is directed at first inwards, forwards, and slightly upwards (pars externa) ; it then passes inwards and backwards (pars media), and lastly is carried inwards, forwards, and slightly downwards (pars interna). It forms an oval cylindrical canal, the greatest diameter being in the vertical direction at the external orifice, but nearly in the horizontal direction at the tympanic end. It presents two con- strictions, one near the inner end of the cartilaginous portion, and another, the isthmus, in the osseous portion, about three-quarters of an inch from the bottom of the concha. The membrana tympani, which closes the inner end of the meatus, is obUquely directed; in consequence of this the floor of the canal is longer than the roof, and the anterior wall longer than the posterior. The auditory canal is formed partly by cartilage and membrane, and partly by bone, and is lined by skin. The cartilaginous portion is about one-third of an mch (8 mm.) m length; it is continuous with the cartilage of the pinna, and firmly attached to the circumference of the auditory process of the temporal bone. The cartilage is deficient at its upper and back part, its place being suppUed by fibrous membrane. This part of the canal is rendered freely movable by two or three deep fissures (incisures Santorini) which extend through the cartilage ni a vertical direction. • i i.i j The osseous portion is about two-thirds of an inch (16 mm.) m length, and narrower than the cartilaginous portion. It is directed inwards and a httle forwards, forming in its course a slight curve the convexity of which is upwards and backwards. Its inner end, which communicates, in the dry bone, Mith the cavity of the tympanum, is smaller than the outer, and sloped, the anterior wall projecting beyond the posterior for about one-sixth of an mch ; it is marked, except at its upper part, by a narrow groove, the sulcus ty7npanicms, in which the circumference of the membrana tympam is attached, its outer end is dHated and rough in the greater part of its circumference, for the attach- ment of the cartilage of the pinna. Its transverse section is oval tlie greatest diameter being from above downwards and backwards, ihe front and lower parts of this canal are formed by a curved plate of bone, the tympanic plate, which, in the foetus, exists as a separate ruig (annulus tympamcus), incomplete at its upper part. See section on Osteology (page 231). The skin Uning the meatus is very thin, adheres closely to the cartilaginous and osseous portions of the tube, and covers the surface of the membrana tympani, forming its outer layer. After maceration, the thin POUch of epidermis, when withdra.^^l, preserves the form of the meatus. In the thick subcutaneous tissue of the cartilaginous part of the meatus are numerous ceruminous glands, which secrete the ear-wax. They resemble m structure sweat-glands, and then: ducts open on the surface of the skin. Relations of the meatus.-ln front of the osseous part is the condyle of the mandible, whiS hoTev/r t Larated from the cartUaginous part by the retro-mandibular part of the parltkl gland. ^The movements of the jaw influence to some extent the umen of this latter portion.

ANGIOLOGY 696 the transverse processes and is distributed to tlie muscles and skin of the back. It gives off a sphial hrancli (ramus spinalis) which enters the spinal canal and is distributed in a similar manner to the lateral spinal branches of the vertebral (page 600). 31usatlfir branches are supplied from each lumbar artery and from its dorsal branch to the neighbouring muscles. Middle Sacral Artery The middle sacral artery (a. sacralis media) is a small vessel, which arises from the back of the aorta, at or a little above its bifurcation. It descends upon the last lumbar vertebra, and along the middle line of the front of the sacrum, to the upper part of the coccyx ; it anastomoses with the lateral sacral arteries, and terminates in the coccygeal body. From it, minute branches pass to the posterior surface of the rectum. Other branches arc given off on each side, which anastomose with the lateral sacral arteries, and send offsets into the anterior sacral foramina. It is crossed by the left common iliac vein, and is accompanied by a pair of vense comites ; these unite to form a single vessel, which opens into the left common iliac vein. Common Iliac Aetebies (fig. 602) The abdominal aorta divides, on the left side of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra, into the two common iliac arteries. Each is about two inches in length. They diverge from the termination of the aorta, pass downwards and outwards to the margin of the pelvis, and divide, opposite the intervertebral disc between the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum, into two branches, the external and internal iliac arteries : the former supplies the lower extremity; the latter, the viscera and parietes of the pelvis. 1 1 f J The right common iliac (fig. 608) is somewhat longer than the left, and passes more obliquely across the body of the last lumbar vertebra. In front of it are the peritoneum, the small intestines, branches of the sympathetic nerves, and at its point of division, the ureter. Behind, it is separated from the bodies of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae, and the interverung disc, by the two common iliac veins. On its outer side, it is in relation, above, with the mferior vena cava and the right common ihac vein; and, below, with the Psoas magnus muscle. On its inner side, above, is the left common iliac vein. . , , 4.1 The left common iliac is in relation, m front, with the peritoneum, the smaU intestines, branches of the sympathetic nerves, and the superior hfemor- rhoidal artery ; and is crossed at its point of bifurcation by the ureter. It rests on the bodies of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae, and the mter- vening disc The left common iliac vein hes partly on the mner side of, and partly behind the artery ; on its outer side, the artery is in relation with the Psoas magnus muscle. . Branches—The common iliac arteries give off small branches to the peritoneum. Psoas magnus, ureters, and the surrounding cellular tissue, and occasionaUy give origin to the ilio-lumbar, or accessory renal arteries. Peculiarities—The point of origin varies accordmg to the bifurcation of the aorta In three-fourths of a large number of cases, the aorta bifiu^cated either upon the fourth lumbar vertebra, or upon the disc between it and the fifth ; the bifurcation ^em^ m one case out of nine, below, and in one out of eleven above this point. In about e gh^ ei cent, of the cases the aorta bifurcated within half an inch above or below the le^el of the crest of the ilium : more frequently below than above. W nf The point of division is subject to great variety. In two-thirds of a large number of cases it wa« between the last lumbar vertebra and the upper border of ^^^^^^^T^ above that point in one case out of eight, and below it in one case out of six. The left common iliac artery divides lower down more frequently than the right The relative lenqths, also, of the two common iliac arteries vary.

THE LUNGS 1085 structure.—The lungs are composed of an external serous coat, a subserous areolar tissue, and the pulmonary substance or parenchyma. ^ j • The serous coat is the visceral layer of the pleura ; it is thm, transparent, and invests the entu-e organ as far as the root. Fig. 897.—Section of lung tissue. Epithelium llveoK ^ InfunAihtiluin The subserous areolar tissue contains a large proportion of elastic fibres ; it invests the entire sm-face of the lung, and extends inwards between the lobules. The parenchyma is composed of lobules which, although closely connected together by an interlobular areolar tissue, are quite distinct from one another, and may be teased asunder without much difaculty in the foetus. The lobules vary in size : those on the Fig. 898.—Section of a portion of an ateleotio lung of kitten, |t.^^*/.^fl':.if)^J^ Bronchial epitheliia, , : ' " ■ s , ;.

Each lobule is composed of one of the ramifications of a broncliial tube and its terminal aii--cells, and of the ramifications of the pulmonary and bronchial vessels, lymphatics, and nerves ; all of these structures being connected together by areolar ti.ssue.

OSTEOLOGY 326 fifths by the ischium, and the remaining fifth by the pubic bone. It is bounded by a prominent, uneven rim, which is thick and strong above, and serves for the attachment of tlie cotyloid ligament, which contracts its orifice, and deepens the surface for articulation. It presents below a deep notch, the cotyloid notch (incisura acetabuli), which is continuous with a circular depression, the fossa acetabuli, at the bottom of the cavity : this depression is perforated by numerous apertures, and lodges a mass of fat. The notch is converted into a foramen by tlie transverse ligament; through the foramen nutrient vessels and nerves enter the joint; the margins of the notch serve for the attachment of the lii^amentum teres. The ^obturator or thyroid foramen (foramen obturatum) is a large aperture, situated between the ischium and pubis. In the male it is large and of an oval form, its longest diameter being obhquely from before backwards ; in the female it is smaller, and more triangular. It is bounded by a tliin, uneven margin, to which a strong membrane is attached ; and presents, superiorly, a deep Fig. 380.—Plan of ossification of the os innominatum. groove (sulcus obturatorius), wliich runs from the pelvis obliquely inwards and downwards.

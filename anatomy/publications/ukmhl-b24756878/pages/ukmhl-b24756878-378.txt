360 OSTEOLOGY The third metatarsal bone (fig. 413) articulates behind, by means of a triangular smooth surface, with the external cuneiform ; on its inner side, by two facets, with the second metatarsal; and on its outer side, by a suigle Fig. 413.—The tliii'd metatarsal.

The fourth metatarsal bone (fig its posterior extremity presents an The latter facet is situated at the upper FiG.'415.—The fifth metatarsal. (Left.; 414) is smaller in size than the preceding ; oblique quadrilateral surface for articu- lation with the cuboid ; a smooth facet on the inner side, divided by a ridge into an anterior portion for articulation -with the third metatarsal, and a posterior portion for articulation with the external cuneiform ; on the outer side a single facet, for articulation with the fifth metatarsal. The fifth metatarsal bone (fig. 415) is recognised by a tubercular eminence, the tuberosity, on the outer side of its base. The 6a.se articulates behind, by a tri- angular surface cut obliquely from without inwards, with the cuboid; and mter- nally, with the fourth metatarsal. On the inner part of its dorsal surface is inserted the tendon of the Peroneus tertius, and on the dorsal surface of the tuberosity that of the Peroneus brevis. A strong band of the plantar fascia con- nects the projecting part of tlie tubero- sity Avith the outer tuberosity on the under surface of the os calcis. The plantar surface of the base is grooved for the tendon of the Abductor minimi digiti. and gives origin to the Flexor brevis minimi digiti. Articulations.-Each metatarsal bone articulates with one or more of the tarsal bones by its proximal extremity, and by the other with one of the first row ot For ah metatarsal For cuboid Tiibci osily

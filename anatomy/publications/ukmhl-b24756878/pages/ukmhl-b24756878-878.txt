860 NEUROLOGY upturned end of the fissure of Sylvius. It runs upwards and backwards, parallel to the fissure of Rolando, and is sometimes divided mto an upper and a loiver ramus. It forms the posterior hmit of tlie postcentral convolution. From about tlie middle of the postcentral sulcus, or from the upper end of its inferior ramus, the horizontal portion of the mtraparietal sulcus is carried backwards and shghtly upwards on the parietal lobe, and is prolonged under the name of the ramus occipitalis, on to tlie occipital lobe ; liere it divides into two parts, which form nearly a right angle with the main stem and constitute the sulcus occipitalis transversus. The part of the parietal lobe above the horizontal ramus is named the superior parietal convolution; the part below, the inferior parietal convolution. ^ ■ , ^ a t „v„a<- The postcentral convolution (gyrus centralis posterior) extends from the gi cat longitudinal fissure above to the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylviusbe om .

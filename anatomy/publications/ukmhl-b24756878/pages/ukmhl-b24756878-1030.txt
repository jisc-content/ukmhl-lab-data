1012 ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE are inserted into it, and its anterior part is covered by the conjunctival mem- brane : hence the whiteness and briUiancy of the front of the eyeball. Its inner surface is stained of a brown colour and marked by grooves, in which are lodged the ciliary nerves and vessels ; it is separated from the outer surface of the choroid by an extensive lymph-space [s-patium perichorioideale) which is traversed by an exceedingly fine cellular tissue, the lamina suprachorioidea. Beliind, it is pierced by the optic nerve, and is continuous through the fibrous sheath of this nerve with the dura mater. At tlie point where the optic nerve passes through the sclera, the tunic forms a thin cribriform lamina, the lamina cribrosa sclerce ; the minute orifices in this lamina serve for the trans- mission of the nervous filaments, and the fibrous septa dividing them from one another are continuous with the membranous processes which separate the bundles of nerve-fibres. One of these openings, larger than the rest, occupies the centre of the lamella ; it transmits the central artery and vein of the retina. Around the cribriform lameUa are numerous small apertures for the transmission of the ciliary vessels and nerves, and about midway between Fig. 832.â€”Horizontal section of the eyeball.

NEUROLOGY 802 Most of the nerve-cells are arranged in longitudinal columns, which appear as groups on transverse section (figs. 679, 680). „ . , • , Nerve-cells in the anterior horn.—The nerve-cells in the anterior horn are arranged in columns of varymg length, and appear in groups in successive transversi sections of the cord. The longest of these ceU-columns occupies the mesial part of the anterior horn, and is named the antero-mesial: it is absent only in the fifth lumbar, the first sacral and the upper part of the second sacral segments (Bruce).* Behind it is a dorso-mesial column of small ceUs. which extends from the second thoracic to the first lumbar segment, and is also present in the first, sixth, and seventh cervical segments. In the cervical and lumbar enlargements, where the anterior horn is expanded m a lateral dkection, the foUowing additional columns are present : viz • (a) antero-lateral, in the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical and the second Fig. 679. -Mode of distribution of the nerve-cells in the grey matter.

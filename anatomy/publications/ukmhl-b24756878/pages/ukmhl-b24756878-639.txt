621 ARCH OF THE AORTA backwards these are : the left phrenic, the inferior cervical cardiac branch of the left pneumogastric, the superior cardiac branch of the left sympathetic, and the trunk of the left pneumogastric. As the last nerve crosses the arch it gives off its recur- rent laryngeal branch, which hooks round below the vessel and then passes upwards on its right side. The left superior intercostal vein runs obliquely upwards and forwards, on the left side of the arch between the phrenic and pneumogastric nerves. On the right are the deep cardiac plexus, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, the oesophagus, and the thoracic duct; the trachea lies behind and to the right of the vessel. Above are the innominate, left common carotid, and left subclavian arteries. Fig. 572.—The arch of the aorta, and its branches. which arise from the convexity of the arch and are crossed close to their origins by the left innominate vein. Below are the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, the left bronchus, the ligaraentum arteriosum, the superficial cardiac plexus, and the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. As already stated, the ligamentuni arteriosum connects the commencement of the left pulmonary artery to the aortic arch. Between the origin of the left subclavian artery and the attachment of the ductus arteriosus the lumen of the foetal aorta is considerably narrowed, forming what is termed the isthmus aortcB, while immediately beyond the ductus arteriosus the vessel presents a fusiform dilatation which His has named the aortic spindle —the point of j miction of the two parts being marked in the concavity of the

81 MATURATION OF THE OVUM of the two resulting cells. This second division is also unequal, producing a large cell which constitutes the mature ovum, and a small cell, the second polar body. The first polar body frequently divides while the second is being formed, and as a final result four cells are produced, viz. the mature ovum and three polar bodies, each of which contains two chromosomes, i.e. one half the number present in the nuclei of the somatic cells of members of the same species. The nucleus of the mature ovum is termed the female pronucleus. The number of polar bodies varies in the ova of different animals ; typically three are formed, but in some animals there is only one, in others there are two—the last condition being probably explained by the fact that the first polar body has not undergone subdivision by the time the second is separated from the ovum. THE SPERMATOZOON The spermatozoa or male germ-cells are developed within the tubuU semiuiferi of the testes. They are present in enormous numbers in the seminal fluid, and consist of small but greatly modified cells. The human spermatozoon possesses a head, a neck, a connecting piece or body, and a tail (fig. 97). Fig. 97.—Human^spermatozoon.

Its anterior two-thirds are covered by a layer of modified proto- plasm, which is named th.Qhead-cap. This, in some animals (e.g. the salamander), is prolonged into a barbed spearUke process or perforaior, which probably facilitates

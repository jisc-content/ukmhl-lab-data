NEUROLOGY 954 to every case. The following is, however, tlie most constant arrangement. The fifth and sixtli cervical unite soon after their exit from the mtervertebral foramina to form a common trunk. The eighth cervical and first thoracic also unite to form one trunk, while the seventh cervical runs out alone. Three trunks are thus formed, an upper one, formed by the junction of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves ; a midcUe one, consisting of the seventh cervical nerve ; and a lower one, formed by the junction of the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves. 4s they pass beneath the clavicle, each of these three trunks divides into two divisions an anterior and a posterior* The anterior divisions of the upper Fig. 796.—Plan of brachial plexus. from TV C.

690 ANGIOLOGY or three small inferior pyloric branches to the pyloric end of the stomach and The right gastro-epiploic (a. gastroepiploica dextra) runs fromrightto left along the greater curvature of the stomach, between the layers of the great omentum anastomosing about the middle of the lower border of the stomach mth the right aastro-epiploic from the splenic artery. This vessel gives off uumerous branches tome of which ascend to supply both surfaces of the stomach, while others descend to sunply the great omentum. • n j j The superior pancreatico-duodenal (a. pancreaticoduodenahs superior) descends between the contiguous margins of the duodenum and pancreas. It supplies both these organs, and anastomoses with the mferior pancreatico-duodenal branch of the superior mesenteric artery, and with the pancreatic branches of the splemc The cystic (a. cystica) (fig. 603), usually a branch of the right hepatic passes downwards and forwards along the neck of the gall-bladder and divides m o two bTanches, one of which ramfies on its free surface, the other between it and. thesm-facesof the Uvex^ ^ ^ ^^^^ ^^^^ three branches o" the cceliac axis, and is remarkable for the extreme toi-tuosity of Its course It passes horizontally to the left side, behind he peritoneum anfalo^ he upper border of the pancreas, accompanied by the splemc vein, which 1 et below it ; it crosses in front of the upper part of the left kidney Tnd on arrives near the spleen, divides into branches, some of M'hich enter tL hXs o Sit organ between the two layers of the lieno-renal ligament to be dStiiUtS tol^^ structure ; some are distributed to the pancreas, win e others pass to 4e greater curvature of the stomach between the layers of the gastro-splenic omentum.

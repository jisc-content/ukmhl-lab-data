242 OSTEOLOGY above downwards by a groove for the passage of a branch of the nasal nerve. The superior border is narroAV, thick, and serrated for articulation with the nasal notch of the frontal bone. The inferior border is thin, and serves for the attacli- ment of the upper lateral cartilage of the nose. It presents, about its middle, a notch which marks the termination of the groove for the nasal nerve. The external border is serrated, bevelled at the expense of the inner surface above, and of the outer below, to articulate with the frontal process of the maxilla. The internal border, thicker above than below, articulates with its feUow of the opposite side, and is prolonged behind into a vertical crest, which forms part of the septum of the nose : this crest articulates, from above downwards, with the nasal spine of the frontal, the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, and the septal cartilage of the nose. Ossification.—Each bone is ossified from one centre, which appears about the eighth week of foetal life in the membrane overlying the front part of the cartilagin- ous nasal capsule. Articulations.—The nasal articulates with four bones : two of the cramum, the frontal and ethmoid, and two of the face, the opposite nasal and the maxilla. The Maxillae or Supbriob, Maxillary Bone.s The Maxillse are the most important bones of the face from a surgical point of view, on account of the diseases to which some of then- parts are £able They are the largest bones of the face, excepting the mandible, and form by their union, the whole of the upper jaw. Each assists m the formation of three cavities—viz. the roof of the mouth, the floor and outer waU of the nose and the floor of the orbit; it also enters into the formation of two fosste, the zygomatic and spheno-maxfllary, and two fissures, the spheno-maxillary and pterygo-maxiUary. i.- * <. i Each bone consists of a body and four processes—zygomatic, frontal, alveolar, and palatal. ., , . , j • „ The body (corpus maxiU*) is somewhat pyramidal m shape, and contains a large cavitv, the antrum of Highmore, or maxillary sinus. Its surfaces are four —an anterior or facial, a posterior or zygomatic, a superior or orbital, and an internal or nasal.^^ ^^^^.^^^ ^^^^.^^ anterior) (fig. 313) is dh-ected forwards and outwards.

When however, the thigh is flexed and especially if it be crossed over the opposite one, the trocharitcr produces a blunt eminence on the surface. The upper border is about on a level with the centre of the h.p- S and is indicated by a line di-a\vn from the anterior superior spme of the il.um over Ihe outer sfdL of the hip, to the most prominent point of the tuberosity of the ischium This is known as N61aton's line. The outer and inner condyles of the lower extremity are accessrble to the touch. The outer one is more subcutaneous than the mner one.

Applied Anatomy.—Theie are one or two points about the ossification of the femur bearing on practice to which allusion must be made. The lower end of the femur is the only epiphysis m which ossification has commenced at the time of birth. The presence of this ossific centre is, therefore, a proof, m a newly born child found dead, that the child has arrived at the full period of utero-gestation, and is always relied upon in medico-legal investigations. The position of the epiphysial line should be carefully noted. It is on a level with the adductor tubercle, and the epiphysis does not, therefore, form the whole of the cartilage-clad portion of the lower end of the bone. It is essential to bear this point in imnd in performing excision of the knee, since growth in length of the femur takes place chiefly from the lower epiphysis and any interference with the epiphysial cartilage in a young chUd would mvolve such ultimate shortening of the Umb, from want of growth, as to render the limb almost useless. Separation of the lower epiphysis may take place up to the age of twenty, at which time it be- comes completely joined to the shaft of the bone ; but, as a matter of fact, few cases occur after the age of sixteen or seventeen. The epiphysis of the head of the femur is of i-t-st principally cm acc^n^f^ts bem, tl^seat of on^m. m be noted that the epiphysis tor the head is entu.^^^^^^^^^^ .^^^^ Fractures of the femur .^^-^^f'j^^j^.^t^t^^^^^^^^^ Ihe fracLes of the upper end of the upper end ; of the shaft ; and ot t'le 'ower enu jimction of the neck may be classified into (I) fracture of the neck ; (2) fracture at tne ]i ^j^^ with the great trochanter ; (3) fracture of the great t^oclianter ^^^^^^^ of Ipiphysis^either of the head or o the great t^^^^^^'^^^^b^f ^j^^ a correct the neck, is usually termed ''^l'"'''P'''\^'J^^^^^ the fracture is designation, as, owing to attachment o^^ ^ lo,,er partly within and partly without the ' Spally women, and usually Appears at 9th month of fcetal life Joins shaft at 20^/i year Loivvr c.Llremify

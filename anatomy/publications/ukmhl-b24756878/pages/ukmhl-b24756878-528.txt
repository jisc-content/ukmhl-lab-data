MYOLOGY 510 downwards towards the thigh, where it is continuous with the fascia lata. Its outer half is rounded, and oblique in direction. Its inner half gradually widens at its attachment to the jjubis, is more horizontal in direction, and lies beneath the spermatic cord. Nearly the whole of the space included between the crural arch and the innominate bone is filled in by the parts which descend from the abdomen into the thigh. Gimbernat's ligament (lig. lacunare) is that part of the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle which is reflected backwards and outwards from the spine of the pubis to be inserted into the pectineal line. It is about half an incli in length, larger in the male than in the female, almost iiorizontal in direction in the erect posture, and of a triangular form with the base directed outwards. Its base, or outer margin, is concave, thin, and sharp, and forms the inner boundary of the crural ring. Its apex corresponds to the spine of the pubis. Its posterior Fig. 505.—The Cremaster muscle. margm is attached to the pectmeal line, and is continuous with tlie pubic portion of the fascia lata. Its anterior margin is attached to Poupart's ligament. Its surfaces are directed upwards and dowTiwards. The triangular fascia (lig. ingumale reflexum) of the abdomen is a layer of tendinous fibres of a triangular shape, formed by an ex- pansion from Gimbernat's ligament and the outer pillar of the ring. It passes inwards behind the sper- matic cord, and expands into a somewhat fan-shaped fascia, lymg behind the inner j)illar of the ex- ternal abdominal ring, and in front of the conjoined tendon, and inter- laces with the ligament of the otlier side at the linea alba. Ligament of Cooper. — This is a strong fibrous band, which was first described by Sir Astley Cooper. It extends outwards from the base of Gimbernat's ligament along the ilio-pectineal line, to which it is attached. It is strengthened by the pectineal aponeurosis, and by a lateral expansion from the lower attachment of the linea alba (adminiculum linese alba;). The Obliquus internus abdominis (fig. 504), thinner and smaUer than the preceding, beneath which it lies, is of an irregularly quadrilateral torm, and situated at the side and fore part of the abdomen. It arises, by fleshy fibres, from the outer half of Poupart's ligament, being attached to the groove on its upper surface, from the anterior two-thirds of the middle lip of the crest of the ilium, and from the posterior lamella of the lumbar fascia. Irom this origin the fibres diverge, those from Poupart's ligament, few m number, and paler in colour than the rest, arch downwards and mward.s across the spermatic cord in the male and the round ligament in the female, and, becoming tindinous, are inserted, conjointly with those of Transversahs i^^^^^^^^ crest of the pubis and inner part of tlie ilio-pectuieal line belund Gunberna^^^^ ligament, forming what is known as the '^""JO"!^^ t.^.^^^on of tl e Li^^^^^^^^ oblique and Transversalis.

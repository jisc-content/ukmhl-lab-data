ANTERIOR AND MIDDLE FOSS^ 273 ment of the frontal crest for the attachment of the falx cerebri ; the foramen ccecum, between the frontal bone and tlie crista galli of the ethmoid, which usually transmits a small vein from the nose to the superior longitudinal sinus; behind the foramen caecum, tlie crista galli, the free margin of which affords attacliment to the falx cerebri ; on either side of the crista galli, the olfactory groove formed by the cribriform plate, which supports the olfactory bulb, and presents foramina for the transmission of the olfactory nerves to the nose, and in front a slit-Hke opening for the nasal branch of the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve. On the outer side of eacli olfactory groove ai'e tlie internal openings of tlie anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina ; the anterior, situated about the middle of the outer margin of the olfactory gi'oove, transmits the anterior ethmoidal vessels and the nasal nerve ; tlie nerve runs in a groove alono- the outer edge of the cribi-iform plate to the slit-like opening above mentioned ; the posterioi- ethmoidal foramen opens at the back part of this margin under cover of the projecting lamina of the sphenoid, and transmits a menm- geal branch from tlie posterior ethmoidal artery. Farther back in the middle line is the ethmoidal spine, bounded behind by a slight elevation separating two shallow longitudinal gi-ooves which support tlie olfactory lobes. Behind this is the anterior margin of the optic groove, running outwards on either side to the upper margin of the optic foramen. The middle fossa, deeper than the preceding, is narrow in the middle Ime, but becomes wider at the side of the skull. It is bounded in front by the posterior margins of the lesser wings of the sphenoid, the anterior clmoid processes, and the ridge forming the anterior margin of the optic groove : behind, by the superior borders of the petrous portions of the temporals, and the dorsum selte, externally by the squamous portions of the temporals, antero- inferior angles of the parietals, and greater wmgs of the sphenoid. It is traversed by four sutures, the squamous, spheno-parietal, spheno-squamosal, and spheno- petrosal. The middle part of the fossa presents, in front, the optic groove and olivary eminence ; the optic groove ternimates on either side at the optic foramen which transmits the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery to the orbital cavity. Behind the optic foramen the anterior clinoid process is directed backwards and in\^^ards and gives attachment to the tentorium cerebelli. Behind the olivary eminence is a deep depression, th&--sella turcica, which lodges the pituitary" body and presents on its anterior wall, the middle clinoid processes. The sella turcica is bounded posteriorly by a quadi-ilateral plate of bone, the dorsum sellcB the upper angles of which are surmounted by the posterior clinoid processes ■ these attord attachment to the tentorium cerebelli, and below each is a notch for the sixth nerve. On either side of the sella turcica is the carotid groove, which IS broad, shallow, and curved somewhat like the italic letter f. It be^rins behind at the foramen lacerum medium, and ends on the inner side of the anterior clinoid process, where it is sometimes converted into a foramen (carotico-clinoid) bv the union of the anterior with the middle clinoid process ; posteriorly it is bounded on the outer side by the lingula. This groove lodges the cavernous smus and the internal carotid artery, the latter being surrounded by a plexus or sympathetic nerves. The lateral parts of the middle fossa are of con.siderabledepth, and support the temporal lobes of the brain. They are marked by depressions for the brZl!;?''''f ^1^?^ t^-'-^^ersed by furrows for the anterior and posterior Dranches of the middle memngeal artery. These furrows begin near TZl^^^'T'^ spmosum and the anterior runs forwards and up.\'ards to the anteio-inferior angle of the parietal, where it is sometimes converted mto a Dony canal; the posterior runs backwards and outwards across the squamous C, 'J." 1 r?i"P°''?;^ ^'^^ P-'^s^es on to the parietal near the middle of its nXl^Tni^' The following apertures are also to be seen.

1078 SPLANCHNOLOGY Pneumothorax, or the presence of gas in the pleural cavity, is a common terminal event in tuberculosis of the lungs ; less often it is due to trauma—rupture of the lung, for example, when the chest is crushed, or tearing of the lung tissue by the sharp projecting end of a broken rib. Aii- escapes from the lung into the pleural cavity ; the elastic tissue of the lung at once contracts, and finally that organ shrinks away to a dark rounded mass the size^of a fist, lying close against the vertebral column. The symptoms of pneumothorax are often very severe ; cyanosis, intense dyspnoea, great pain on the afTected side, and cardiac failure. Their severity is increased by the fact that the blood-vessels of the collapsed lung oii'er less resistance to the circulation of the blood than do those of the other lung. Not only, therefore, does the sound lung suddenly have to take over the work—the aeration of the blood—normally performed by both lungs, but it has to do so at the moment when the circulation of blood through it is partially short-cu:cuited by the collapsed lung. If the patient survives for a few days, empyema often complicates the pneumothorax, setting up the condition called fyofneumotliorax. In operations upon the kidney, it must be borne in mind that the pleura usually extends below the level of the inner portion of the last rib, and may therefore be opened in these operations, especially when the last rib is removed in order to give more room. The Mediastinum The mediastinum is the space left in and near the median line of the chest by the non-apposition of the two pleurae. It extends from the sternum in front to the vertebral column behind, and contains all the thoracic viscera exceptmg the lungs. The mediastinum may be divided for purposes of description into two parts : an upper portion, above the upper level of the pericardium, which is named the superior mediastinum (Struthers) ; and a lower portion, below the upper level of the pericardium. This lower portion is agam subdivided Fig. 891.—a transverse section of the thorax, showing the relative position of the viscera, and the reflections of the pleurae.

EMBRYOLOGY 106 the bones of tlie base of the skull are preceded by cartilage, those of the roof and sides by membrane. The posterior part of the base of the skull is developed around the notochord, and exhibits a segmented condition analogous to that of the vertebral column, while the anterior part arises in fi-ont of the notochord and shows no regular segmentation. The base of the skull may therefore be divided mto (a) a chorclal or vertebral, and (b) a frecJiordal or prevertebral portion. In the lower vertebrates two pairs of cartilages are developed : viz. a pair of parachordal cartilages, one on either side of the notochord ; and a pair of prechordal cartilages, the traheculcB cranii, in front of the notochord (fig. 132).

In passing to reacli the lateral column of the opposite side, the fibres of the crossed pyramidal tracts extend backw ards tliroug - thi anterior cornua, and the liead of each of these horns is separated from i hic,pmffs 691 692). The base retains its position in relation to the ventral aspec of the central canal, and, when the latter opens into the fourth ventric e appears in the floor of that cavity close to the middle line, where it forms 1 e SeTof ^he tW^ and sixth nerves; while above the level of the ventricle it exists as the nuclei of the third and fourth nerves m relation to the floor of the aaueduct of Sylvius. The head of the cornu is pushed outward.s and orms a^ SrgaS coTu^n^ the nucleus amhigurcs, which gives ongm from belo upwards to the bulbar part of the spinal accessory ^^d the motor fibres of the vagus and glosso-pharyiigeal, and still higlier to the motor fibres of the seventh and fifth nerves.

The fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus constitute the posterior sensory f ascicuU of the spinal cord ; they are prolonged upwards into the lower part of the medulla oblon- gata, where they termmate respec- tively in the nucleus graciUs and nucleus cuneatus. These two nuclei are con- tinuous, in front, witli the central grey matter of the cord, and may be regarded as dorsal projections of thi.s, each being covered superficially by the fibres of the correspondmg fasciculus.

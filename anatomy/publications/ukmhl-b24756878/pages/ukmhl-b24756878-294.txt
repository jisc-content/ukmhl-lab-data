276 OSTEOLOGY spine of the frontal; in the middle, by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid ; behind, by the vomer and rostrum of the sphenoid ; below, by the crest of the maxiUcB and palate bones. It presents, in front, a large, triangular notch, wliich receives the septal cartilage of the nose ; and behind, the free edge of the vomer. Its surface is marked by numerous turrows for vessels and nerves and by the groove for the naso-]3alatine nerve, and is traversed by sutures connecting the bones of which it is formed. The outer wall (fig. 344) is formed, in front, by the frontal process of the maxilla and by the lachrymal bone ; ui the middle, by the ethmoid, maxilla and inferior turbinated bones; behind, by the vertical plate of the palate-bone, and the internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid. This surface presents three irre<^ular longitudinal passages, termed the superior, middle, and inferior meatuses of the nose. The superior meatus, the smallest of the three, occupies the middle tliird of the outer wall. It lies between the superior and middle tuj-binated processes of the ethmoid ; the spheno-palatine foramen opens into Fig. 344.—Roof, floor, and outer wall of left nasal fossa.

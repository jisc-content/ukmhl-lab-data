SUPERFICIAL CERVICAL REGION 471 MUSCLES AND FASCI/E OF THE NECK Tlie muscles of the neck may be arranged into groups, corresponding with the regions in which they are situated. These groups are nine in number : I. Superficial Region. V. Pharyngeal Region. II Infrahyoid Region. VI. Palatal Region. Ill Suprahyoid Region. VII. Anterior Vertebral Region. IV. Lingual Region. VIII. Lateral Vertebral Region. IX. Muscles of the Larynx. Tlie muscles contained in each of these groups are the followmg : /. Superficial Region. Platysma. Sterno-cleido-mastoid. II. Infrahyoid Region. Sterno-hyoid. Sterno-thyroid. Thyro-hyoid. Omo-hyoid. ///. Suprahyoid Region, Digastric. Stylo-hyoid. Mylo-hyoid. Genio-hyoid. IV. Idngv/il Region. Genio-hyo-glossus. Hyo-glossus.

Sterno-cleido-mastoid. The superficial cervical fascia is a thin lamina, which is hardly demon- strable as a separate membrane. It invests the Platysma. The Platysma (fig. 486) is a broad, thin plane of muscular fibres situated on the side of the neck. It arises by thin, fibrous bands from the fascia covering the upper part of the Pectoralis major and Deltoid; its fibres pass over the clavicle, and proceed obliquely upwards and inwards along the side of the neck. The anterior fibres interlace, below and behind the sympliysis menti, with the fibres of the muscle of the opposite side ; the posterior fibres pass over the mandible, some of them being attached to the bone below the external oblique line, others passing on to be inserted into the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the lower part of the face, many of these fibres blending with the muscles about the angle and lower part of the mouth. Sometimes fibres can be traced to the Zygomatic muscles, or to the margin of

SPLANCHNOLOGY 11G2 Cooper has described an investment for femoral hernia under the name of fascia propria, lying immediately external to the peritoneal sac but frequently separated from it by some adipose tissue. Surgically it is important to remember the frequent existence of this layer on account of the ease with which an inexperienced operator may mistake the fascia for the peritoneal sac and the contained fat for omentum, as there is often a great excess of subperitoneal fatty tissue enclosed in the ' fascia propria.' In many cases it resembles a fatty tumour, but on further dissection the true hernial sac will be found in the centre of the mass of fat. The fascia propria is merely modified extra-peritoneal tissue which has been thickened to form a membranous sheet by the pressure of the hernia. WTien the intestine descends along the femoral canal only as far as the saphenous opening the condition is known as incomplete femoral hernia. The small size of the protrusion in this form of hernia, on account of the firm and resisting nature of the canal in which it is contained, renders it an exceedingly dangerous variety of the disease, from the extreme difficulty of detecting the existence of the swelling, especially in corpulent subjects. The coveiings of an incomplete femoral hernia would be from without inwards : integument, superficial fascia, superior falciform process of fascia lata, femoral sheath, septum crurale and peritoneum. The seat of stricture of a femoral hernia varies : it may be in the peritoneum at the neck of the hernial sac ; in the greater number of cases it is at the point of junction of the superior falciform process with the free edge of Gimbernat's hgament; or it may be at the margin of the saphenous openuig. The stricture should in every case be divided in a direction upwards and inwards for a distance of about one-sixth to one-quarter of an inch. All vessels or other structures of importance in relation to the neck of the sac will thus be avoided. The spine of the pubis forms an important landmark in serving to differentiate the inguinal from the femoral variety of hernia. The inguinal protrusion is above and to the inner side of the spme, while the femoral is below and to its outer side. There are several details of practical interest in connection with the mesentery which merit notice. 1. The depth of the mesentery—that is to say, the distance from its parietal to its intestinal attachment—is normally less than eight inches, generally nearer six or seven; but under certain abnormal conditions it may become elongated, and this would appear to favour the occurrence of hernia of the intestine. 2. Not only may the depth of the mesentery be increased, but its point of attachment to the posterior abdominal wall may yield, and descend over the lumbar vertebrae. This condition, which is known under the name of enteroptosis, usually occurs in women who have borne many children, and is attended with general relaxation of the abdominal parietes. It produces a charac- teristic appearance, the abdomen being prominent and pendulous below, while above, it is flattened and constricted. 3. Holes are sometunes present in the mesentery, and these may be congenital, or may be the result of injury. They are of practical importance, since a knuckle of intestine may become herniated into one of them, causing acute strangulation. 4. The lymphatic glands contained between the two layers of the mesentery are frequently the seat of tuberculous deposit, especially in children. The surgical anatomy of the rectum is of considerable importance. There may be congenital malformations due to arrest of, or imperfection in, development. Thus, there mav be no proctodosal invagination (see page 161), and consequently a complete absence of the anusT or the hind-gut may be imperfectly developed, and there may be an absence of the rectum, though the anus is developed; or the ectodermal invagination may not communicate with the termination of the hind-gut from want of solution of continuity m the septum which in early fcetal life exists between the two. The mucous membrane is thick and but loosely connected to the muscular coat beneath, and thus favoiu-s prolapse, especially in children. The vessels of the rectum are arranged, as mentioned above loncdtudinally, and are contained in the loose cellular tissue between the mucous and mulcular coats, and receive no support from surrounding tissues, and this favours vancosi y Moreover, the veins, after running upwards in a longitudinal direction for about fr^^ '^^^J^ in the submucous tissue, pierce the muscular coats, and are liable to become constr cte 1 at his spot by the confection of the muscular wall of the gut.

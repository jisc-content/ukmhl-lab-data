EMBRYOLOGY 134 of the vesicle : the central parts of the walls of the discs coalesce and disappear, while the peripheral portions persist to form the membranous semicircular cana s of which the external canal is the last to be developed (figs. 171,. 172). The central part of the vesicle represents the membranous vestibule and is subdmded by a constriction into a smaller anterior part, the saccule, and a larger posterior part, the utricle. This subdivision involves the proxima part of the ductus endolymphaticus, with the result that the utricle and saccu e ultimately commiiiicate with each other by means of a Y-shaped canal.

The view generallv maintained is that the tncu^ and malleu/Rve developed from the pro^mal end of the mandibular (Meckel's) cartilage (fig 138) ; that the base of the stapes is formed by the ossification of the mesoderm which fills in the foramen ovale, while its arch is developed around a small vessel the stapedial artery, which subsequently under- goes atrophy. As already stated (footno e page 108), Gadow regards all three ossicles as being derived from the hyomandibula. The external auditory meatus is formed from the outer part of the hyomandibular cleft, while the piima is developed by the gradual differenriation o six tubercles which appear around the outer -xgin f ^ ^^jf^S^ on the posterior edge of the fibular a ch t^^^^^^^ of the tragus and crus hel cis.

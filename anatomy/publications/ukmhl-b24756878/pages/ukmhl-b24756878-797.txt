779 LYMPHATICS OP THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS The external iliac glands, from eight to ten ui number, lie along the external iliac vessels. They are arranged in three gi'oups, one on the outer, another on the inner, and a thnd on the anterior aspect of the vessels ; the tliird group is, however, sometimes absent. Their principal afferents are derived from the superficial and deep inguinal glands, the deep lymphatics of the abdominal wall below the umbilicus and of the adductor region of the thigh, and the lymphatics from the glans penis vel clitoridis, the membranous urethra, the prostate, the base of the bladder, the cervix uteri, and upper part of the vagina. Small chains of glands are sometimes found along the courses of the deep epigastric and deep circumflex iliac arteries, and an obturator gland is occasionally seen on the upper aspect of the obturator foramen. FiQ. 660.â€”Ilio-pelvio lympliatic glands. (Cuneo and Marcille.) The internal iliac or hypogastric glands (lymphoglanduloe hypo- gastricae) (figs. 660, 661) surround the internal iliac vessels, and receive the lymphatics corresponding to the distribution of the branches of the internal iliac artery : i.e. they receive lymphatics from all the pelvic viscera, from the deeper parts of the perinseum, includins the membranous and penile portions of the urethra, and from the buttock and back of the thigh. The sacral glands are an isolated set of this group, placed in the concavity of the sacrum, in relation to the middle and lateral sacral arteries ; they receive lymphatics from the rectum and posterior wall of the pelvis. The efferents of the internal iliac group terminate in the common iliac glands.

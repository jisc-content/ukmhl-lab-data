HISTOLOGY 28 Fig. 35.—Section parallel to the siu'- face from the shaft of the femur. Magnified 100 times. 'At •i ji V v.. canals run parallel with the longitudinal axis of the bone for a short distance and Sen branch and communicate.^ They vary considerably m size, some bemg as much as ^,\„ of an inch in diameter ; the average si'ze is, however, about „;,„ of an inch. Near the medullary cavity the canals are larger than those near the surface of the bone. Each canal contains one or two blood-vessels, with a small quantity of dehcate connective tissue and some nerve filaments. In the larger ones there are also lymphatic vessels, and cells with branching processes which communicate, through the canaHcuU, with the branched processes of certain bone cells in the substance of the bone. Those canals near the surface of the bone open upon it by minute orifices, and those near the medullary ca\dty open in the same wav into this space, so that the whole of the bone is permeated by a system of blood-vessels running through the bony canals in the centres of the Haversian systems. The laniell(B are thin plates ot bone- tissue eucirchng the central canal, and may be compared, for the sake of illustration, to a number of sheets of paper pasted oue over another aroimd a central hollow cyhnder. After macerating a piece of bone m dilute mineral acid, these lameUffi may be stripped off in a longitudinal direction as thin films. If one of these be examined with a high power of the microscope, it will be found to be composed of a finely reticular struc- ture, made up of very slender transparent . fibres, decussating obUquely, and coalescing 1 * i J i -T i* ,.1 I If '• *' ? \ \ V" .

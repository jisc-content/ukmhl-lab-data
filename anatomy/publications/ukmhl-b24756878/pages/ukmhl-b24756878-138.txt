120 EMBRYOLOGY it of the neighbouring parts. By the fifth week the dorsal part of the alar lamina bends in an outward direction along its entire length, to form what is termed the rhombic lip (figs. 153, 156). Witliin a few days this lip becomes applied to, and unites with, the outer surface of the main part of the alar lamina, and so covers in the tractus solitarius and also the spinal root of the fifth nerve. Neuroblasts accumulate Fig. 152.—Transverse section of medulla oblongata of human embryo, x 32. (From KoUmann's in ' Entwekehingsgeschichte.') Boof-plate ■Alar lamina Furrow ietween alar and basal lamincB Basal lamina the mantle layer : those in the basal lamina correspond with the cells in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, and, like them, give origin to motor nerve-fibres ; in the medulla they are, however, arranged in groups or nuclei, instead of forming a continuous column. From the alar lamina and its rhombic lip, neuroblasts migrate into the basal lamina, and become aggregated to form the olivary nuclei, while many send their axis-cylinders through the floor-plate to the opposite side of the medulla, and thus constitute the rudiment of the raphe of the medulla. By means of this thickening of the ventral portion of the medulla the motor nuclei are buried deeply in the interior, and, in the adult, are found close to the fl^^. +hp fourth ventricle This is still further accentuated : (a) by the deXmtt of a?t rior pyramids, which are formed about the fourth tntTy le downward growth of the motor fibres from the cerebral cortex , nnrl (h\ bv the fibres which pass to and from the cerebellum. • ™ FaroZn is developed from the ventro-lateral waU of the metencephalon by a process similar to that which has been described for the medulla. 153 —Transverse section of medulla oblongata of human embryo.

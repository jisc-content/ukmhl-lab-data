It is first directed forwards and to the right, to the upper margin of the first part of the duodenum, forming the lower boundary of the foramen of Winslow. It then passes upwards between the layers of the lesser omentum, and in front of the foramen of Winslow, to the transverse fissure of the liver, where it divides into two branches, right and left, which supply tlie corresponding lobes of that organ, accompanying the ramifications of the portal vein and hepatic ducts. The hepatic artery, in its course along the right border of the lesser omentum, is in relation with the common bile-duct and portal vein, the duct lying to the right of the artery, and the vein behind. Its branches are : Pyloric. Gastro-duodenal|J^g^^.g^^*^°-^P^P/.°i'^-, , , (superior pancreatico-duodenal. Cystic. The pyloric (a. gastrica dextra) arises from the hepatic, above the pylorus, descends to the pyloric end of the stomach, and passes from right to left along its lesser curvature, supplying it with branches, and anastomosing with the gastric branches of the coronary artery. The gastro-duodenal (a. gastroduodenalis) (fig. 604) is a short but large branch, which descends, near the pylorus, behind the first portion of the duodenum, and Fig. 604.—The coeliac axis and its branches; the stomach has been raised and the peritoneum removed.

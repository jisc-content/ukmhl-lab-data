1071 THE TRACHEA AND BRONCHI pulmonary artery lying at first above, and then in front of it. The left bronchus lias no eparterial branch, and therefore it has been supposed by some that there is no upper lobe to the left lung, but that the so-called upper lobe corresponds to the middle lobe of the right lung. The further subdivision of the bronchi will be considered with the anatomy of the lung. If a transverse section be made across the trachea a short distance above its point of bifurcation, and a bird's-eye view taken of its interior (fig. 887), Fig. 886.—Front view of cartilages of larynx, trachea, and bronchi. the septum placed at the bottom of the trachea and separating the tAvo bronchi wdll be seen to occupy the left of the median line, and the riglit bronchus appears to be a more direct continuation of the trachea than the left, so tliat any solid body di'opping into the trachea would naturally be directed towards the right bronchus. This tendency is aided by the larger size of the right tube as compared M'ith its fellow. This fact serves to explain why a foreign body in the trachea more frequently falls into the right bronchus.*' * Reigel asserts that the entry of a foreign body into the left bronchus is by no moans ■so infrequent as is generally supposed.

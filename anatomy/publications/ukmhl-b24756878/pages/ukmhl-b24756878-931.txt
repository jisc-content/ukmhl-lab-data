913 FIFTH CRANIAL NERVE enter the gajiglion, constituting its sensory root. Its motor root is probably derived from the facial nerve through the large superficial petrosal nerve but this nerve consists chiefly of sensory fibres, and its sympathetic root, from the carotid plexus, through the large deep petrosal nerve. These two nerves join together to form a single nerve, the Vidian, before their entrance into the ganglion. The large superficial petrosal branch (n. petrosus superficialis major) is given off from the geniculate gangHon of the facial nerve m the aqueductus Fallopii ; it passes through the hiatus Fallopii, enters the cranial cavity, and runs forwards contained in a groove on the anterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, lying beneath the dura mater. It then enters the cartilaginous substance which fills in the foramen lacerum medium, and joining with the large deep petrosal branch forms the Vidian nerve. The large deep petrosal branch (n. petrosus profundus) is given off from the carotid plexus, and runs through the carotid canal on the outer side of the internal carotid artery. It then enters the cartilaginous substance which fills in the foramen lacerum medium, and joins with the large superficial petrosal nerve to form the Vidian.

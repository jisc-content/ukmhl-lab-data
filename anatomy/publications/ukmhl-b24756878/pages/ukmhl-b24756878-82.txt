64 HISTOLOGY Tlie airerent vessels, as above stated, enter at all parts of the periphery of the gland, and after branching and forming a dense plexus in the substance of the capsule open into the lymph-smuses of the cortical part. In doing this they lose all their coats except their endothelial lining, which is continuous with a layer of similar cells lining the lyn^ph-paths. In like manner tU efferent vesse com- mences from the lymph-sinuses of the medullary portion. The stream of lymph carried to the gland by the afferent vessel thus passes through the plexus m the capsule to the^ymph-paths of the cortical portion, where it is exposed to the actSn of the glLl pulp ; flowing through these it enters the paths or sinuses of the medullary portion, and finally emerges from the hilus by means of the efferent vessel. M^e stream of lymph in its passage through the lymph-smuses is much retarded by the presence of the reticulum, hence morphological elements, elthrno^^ma lor morbid,\re easily arrested and deposited in the sinuses.

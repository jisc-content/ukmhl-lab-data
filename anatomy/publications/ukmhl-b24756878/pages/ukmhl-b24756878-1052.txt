1034 ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE when inflammatory products are poured out. The follicles of the eyelashes, or the seba- ceous glands associated with these follicles may, be the seat of inflammation, constituting the oi-clinary ' stj'^.' The Meibomian glands are allocted in the so-called ' tarsal tumour ' : the tumour, according to some, being caused by the retained secretion of these glands; by others it is believed to be a neoplasm connected with the gland. The ciliary follicles are liable to become inflamed, constituting the disease knowi as blepluiritis ciliaris or ' blear eye.' Irregular or disorderly gi'owth of the eyelashes not infrequently occurs ; some of them being turned towards the eyeball and producing inflammation and ulceration of the cornea, and possibly eventually complete destruction of the eye. The Orbicularis palpebrarum may be the seat of s]5asm, either in the form of slight quivcrmg of the Uds ; or repeated twitchings, most commonly due to errors of refraction in children ; or more continuous spasm, due to some irritation of the fifth or seventh cranial nerve. The Orbi- cularis may be paralysed, generally associated with paralysis of the other facial muscles. Under these circumstances the patient is unable to close the lids, and, if he attempts to do so, rolls the eyeball upwards under the upper lid. The tears overflow from displacement of the lower lid, and the conjunctiva and cornea, bemg constantly exposed and the patient being unable to wink, become u-ritated from dust and foreign bodies. Ptosis, or dropping of the upper eyelid, may be congenital, or may be due to paralysis of the Levator palpebra; superiorLs, in which case there will probably be other symptoms of miplication of the third nerve. The eyelids may be the seat of bruises, wounds, or burns. Following burns, adhesion of the margms of the lids to each other, or adhesion of the lids to the globe, may take place. The eyelids are sometimes the seat of emphysema, after fracture of some of the thin bones forming the inner wall of the orbit. If shortly after such an uijury the patient blows his nose, an- is forced from the nostril through the lacerated structures into the connective tissue of the eyelids, which suddenly swell up and present the pecuhar crackling characteristic of tliis aSection. . . Foreign bodies frequently get mto the conjunctival sac and cause great pam, especially if they come m contact with the corneal surface, durmg the movements of the hd and the eye on each other. The conjunctiva is often mvolved m severe injuries of the eyeball, but is seldom ruptured alone; the most common form of mjury to the conjunctiva alone is from a burn, either from fire, strong acids, or lime. In these cases union is hable to take place between the eyelid and the eyeball. The conjunctiva is often the seat o inflammation arising from many different causes, and the arrangement of the conjunctival vessels should be remembered as aflordmg a means of diagnosis between this condition and injection of the sclera, which is present m mflammation of the deeper structures of the globe. The inflamed conjunctiva is bright red; the vessels are large and tortuous, ana greatest at the ckcumference, shadmg off towards the corneal margin ; they anastomose freely and form a dense network, and they can be emptied or displaced by gentle pressure. Inflammation of the underlying sclera, cihary body, or kis, is a far more serious condition; the mjection is m the deeper vessels of the eye, and as seen through tlie sclera presents a diflhise and dull purplish or.violet zone of circumcomeal discoloration The lachrymal gland is occasionally, though rarely, the seat of mflammation, either acute or chronic ; it is also sometimes the seat of tumours, benign or malignant, and for these may require removal.

THE EAR the The organ of hearing (organon auditus) is divisible into three parts : tl: external efrthe middle eir or tympanum, and the internal ear or labyrinth. The External Ear The external ear consists of the expanded portion named the pinm or ««rLto aS^the auditory ca^url or meatus. The -^^^ the vibrations of the air by which sound is produced; the latter conducts tnob vibrations to the tympanum.

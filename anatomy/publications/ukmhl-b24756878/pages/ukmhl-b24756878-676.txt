658 ANGIOLOGY lirst rib, the pulsation of the subclavian artery will be felt as it passes over the rib. The sheath of the vessels having boon opened, the aneurysm needle may then bo passed around the artery from above doAvnwards and inwards so as to avoid including any of the branches of the brachial plexus. If the clavicle be so raised by the tumour that the application of the ligature camiot be effected in this situation, the artery may be tied above the finst rib, or even behind the Scalenus anticus muscle ; the difficulties of the operation in such a case will be materially increased, on account of the greater depth of the artery, and the alteration in position of the surrounding parts. The second part of the subclavian artery, from being that portion which rises highest in the neck, has been considered favourable for the application of the ligature when it is difficult to tie the artery m the third part of its course. There are, however, many objections to the operation in this situation. It is necessary to divide the Scalenus anticus muscle, upon which lies the ])hrenic nerve, and at the inner side of which is situated the internal jugular vein ; and a wound of either of these structures might lead to the most dangerous consequences. Again, the artery is in contact, below, with the pleura, which must also be avoided ; and, lastly, the proximity of so many of its large branches arismg internal to this pomt must be a still further objection to the operation. In cases, however, where the sac of an axillary aneurysm encroaches on the neck, it may be necessary to divide the outer half or two-thirds of the Scalenus anticus muscle, so as to place the ligature on the vessel at a greater distance from the sac. The operation is performed exactly in the same way as ligature of the third portion, until the Scalenus anticus is exposed, when it is to be divided on a director (never to a greater extent than its outer two-thirds), and it immediately retracts. The operation is therefore merely an extension of the operation for ligatm-e of the third portion of the vcssgI In those cases of aneurysm of the axillary or subclavian artery which encroach upon the outer portion of the Scalenus anticus to such an extent that a ligature cannot be appUed in that situation, it may be deemed advisable, as a last resource, to tie the first portion ot the subclavian artery. On the left side, this operation is almost impracticable ; the great depth of the artery from the surface, its intimate relation with the pleura, and its close nroximitv to the thoracic duct and to so many important vems and nerves, present a series of difficulties which it is next to impossible to overcome.* On the right side, the opera- tion is practicable, and has been performed on several occasions. The mam objection to the operation in this situation is the smalhiess of the interval which usually ex3st.s between the commencement of the vessel and the origin of the nearest branch Th^ 0P«^f,t'0f,,^.^y be performed in the foUowing manner : The patient bemg placed on the table m the supine pos^ion, with the neck extended, an incision should be made along the upper border of the inner part of the clavicle, and a second along the inner border o the ''Stenio^^ meeting the former at an angle.

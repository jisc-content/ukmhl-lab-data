764 ANGIOLOGY blood-vessels. Such non-vascular structures as cartilage, the nails, cuticle, and hair have none, but with these exceptions it is probable that eventually all parts M ill be found to be permeated by these vessels. The lymphatic vessels are arranged into a superficial and a deep set. On the surface of the body the superficial lymphatic vessels are placed immediately beneath the integument, accompanying the superficial veins; they join the deep lymphatic vessels in certain situations by perforating the deep fascia. In the"interior of the body they He in the submucous areolar tissue, throughout the whole length of the gastro-pulmonary and genito-urinary tracts ; and in the subserous tissue of the thoracic and abdominal walls. The method of their origin has been described along with the details of their minute anatomy. Here it will be sufficient to say that a plexiform network of minute lymphatic vessels may be foimd interspersed among the proper elements and blood-vessels of the several tissues ; the vessels composmg the network, as well as the meshes between them, are much larger than those of the capillary plexus. From these networks small vessels emerge, which pass, either to a neighbourmg gland, or to join some larger lymphatic trunk. The dee'p lymphatic vessels, fewer in number, and larger than the superfacial, accompany the deep blood-vessels. Their mode of origin is probably similar to that of the superficial vessels. The lymphatic vessels of any part or organ exceed the veins in number, but in size they are much smaUer. iheir anastomoses also, especiaUy those of the large trunks, are more frequent, and are effected by vessels equal in diameter to those which they connect, the continuous trunks retamuig the same diameter. . j • .1 The lymphatic glands are small, sohd, glandular bodies, situated m the course of the lymphatic vessels. In size they vary from a hemp-seed to an almond, and theh- colour, on section, is of a pinkish-grey tmt, exceptmg m the bronchial glands, which in the adult are mottled with black. Each gland is invested by a fibrous capsule, from which prolongations dip mto its substance, fo/mmg partitions. Before entering a gland a lymphatic or lacteal vessel divides into several small branches, which are named a^erent vessels. As they enter, their external coat becomes contmuous ^y^i)l the capsule of the gland, and the vessels much thinned and consisting oiily of then: internal or endothelial coats pass into the gland and open mto the lymph sinuses. From these sinuses fine branches proceed to form a plexus, the vessels of which unite to form a single ejfermt vessel; this, on emerging from the hilus of the gland, is again mvested with an external coat.

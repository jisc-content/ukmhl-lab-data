THORACIC AORTA 683 communications by which the circulation was carried on, were—Fn-stly, the internal mammary, anastomosing wth the intercostal arteries, with the phreiuc of the abdommal aorta by means of the musculo-phrenic and comes nervi phrenici, and largely with the deep epigastric. Secondly, the superior intercostal, anastomosing anteriorly by means of a larae branch with the first aortic intercostal, and posteriorly with the posterior branch of the same artery. Thirdly, the inferior thyi'oid, by means of a branch about the size of an ordinary radial, forming a communication with the first aortic intercostal. 1 ourthly. Fig. 601.—Thoracic aorta from right side. the transversalis colli, by means of very large communications with the posterior branches of the intercostals. Fifthly, the branches (of the subclavian and axillary) going to the side of the chest were large, and anastomosed freely with the lateral branches of the intercostals.' In the second case Wood describes the anastomoses in a somewhat similar manner, adding the remark, that ' the blood which was brought into the aorta through the anastomoses of the intercostal arteries appeared to be expended principally in supplying the abdomen and pelvis ; while the supply to the lower extremities had passed through the internal mammary and epigastrics.'

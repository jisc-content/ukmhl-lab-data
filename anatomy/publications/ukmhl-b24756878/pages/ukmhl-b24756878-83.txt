THE SKIN 65 the epidermis is removed by maceration, it presents on its under surface a number of pits or depressions corresponding to the papillse, and ridges corresponding to the intervals between them. Fine tubular prolongations are continued from this layer into the ducts of the sudoriferous and sebaceous glands. In structiu-e, the epidermis consists of several layers of epithelial cells, agglutinated together and having a laminated arrangement. These several layers nmy be described as composed of four different strata from witbin outwards : (1) the stratum Malpighii, composed of several layers of epithelial cells; those of the deepest laver are columnar in shape and placed perpendicularly on the surface of the corium, the lower ends of the cells being denticulated, to fit into corresponding denticulations of the true skin ; tbis deepest layer is sometimes termed the basilar Fig. 84.â€”diagrammatic sectional view of the skin (magnified). hii layer or stratum germinativum ; the succeeding strata consist of cells of a more rounded or polyhedr-al form, the contents of which are soft, opaque, granular, and soluble in acetic acid. They are often marked on their surfaces with ridges and furrows, and are covered with numerous fibrils which connect the surfaces of the cells: these are known as fricUe-cells (see page 15). They contain numerous epidermic fibrils, which are stained violet with haeraatoxylin and red with carmine, and form threads of union connecting adjacent cells. Between the cells are fine intercellular clefts which serve for the passage of lymph and in which lymph-corpuscles or pigment-granules may be found. (2) Immediately superficial to these are two or three layers of flattened, spindle-shaped cells, the stratum granulosum, which contain granules that are deeply stained by hematoxylin ; the granules consist F

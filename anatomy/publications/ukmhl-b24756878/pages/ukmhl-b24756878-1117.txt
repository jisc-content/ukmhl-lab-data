THE TEETH 1099 As age advances, thecementin™ of the dental pulp, which shrinks, or even disappears. Development of the Teeth (figs. 909 to 912) In describing the development of the teeth, the mode of formation of the temporary •n f^^fl, Tvin,*- fircii- be considered, and then that of the permanent series, ''^ve oplenTof Se^ t development of these teeth begins at a verfearlyTeHod of fa>tal life-abo^ the sixth week. It commences as a thickening of SpUhelium a ong the line of the future jaw, the thickemng being due to a rapid multi- nlTcXn of the more deeply situated epithelial cells. As the cells multiply they extend FShe subjacen^^^esoderm, and thus form a semicircular ridge or strand of cells mibedded Fig 909 -Sagittal section through the first lower temporary molar of a human embryo 30 mm. long. (Rose.) J-^. L.E.L., labio-dentel lamina, here separated from and weU m advance of the dental l^inna ^ i., placed over the shaUow dental fmrow, points to the dental lamina, which is spread out below to form the enamel germ of the future tooth; P.p., bicuspidate papUla, capped by the enamel germ ; Z.S., oonaenaea tissue forming dental sac ; M.E., mouth-epithehum.

About the seventh week a longitudinal splitting or cleavage of this strand of cells takes place, and it becomes divided uito two strands ; the separation begins in front and extends laterally : the process occupying four or five weeks. Of the two strands thus formed, the cmter or labial forms the futme labio-dental furrow, and is there- fore termed the labio-dental lamina; while the other, the inner ox lingual, is the ridge of cells in connection with which the teeth, both temporary and permanent, are developed. Hence it is known as the dental lamina or common dental germ. It forms a flat band of cells, which

]MALAR BONES 249 canals (foramina zygomaticoorbitalia) ; one of these canals opens into the temporal fossa, the other on the anterior surface of the bone ; the former transmits the temporal branch, the latter the malar branch of the temporo- malar nerve. Its postero-exiernal surface, smooth and convex, forms parts of Fig. 318.—^Right malar bone in situ.

Its superior margin, rough, and directed horizontally, articulates with the frontal bone behind the external angular process. Its posterior margin is serrated for articulation with the greater wing of the sphenoid and the orbital surface of the maxilla. At Fig. 319.—Left malar bone. Outer surface.

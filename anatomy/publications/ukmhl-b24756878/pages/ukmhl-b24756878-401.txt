383 TEMPORO-MANDIBULAR JOINT > lone and, becoming broader as it descends, is inserted into the lingula of the dental foramen. Its outer surface is in relation, above, %vith the External pterygoid ; lower down, it is separated from the neck of the condyle by the Fig. 432.—^Temporo-mandibular articulation. External view. i internal maxillary artery ; still more inferiorly, the inferior dental vessels i and nerve and a lobule of the parotid gland separate it from the ramus of the I mandible. The inner surface i is in relation with the Internal j^^. 433.-Temporo-mandibular articulation. I pterygoid. Internal view. The Interarticular ■ Fibro-cartilage (discus ar- I ticularis) (fig. 434) is a thin I plate of an oval form, placed I horizontally between the con- 1 dyle of the mandible and the i glenoid cavity. Its upper • surface is concavo-convex i from before backwards, and : a little convex transversely, I to accommodate itself to the ! form of the glenoid cavity. 1 Its under surface, which is i in contact with the condyle, is ' concave. Its circumference 1 is connected to the capsular 1 ligament; and in front to the t tendon of the External ptery- ^ goid. It is thicker at its ; periphery, especially behind, i than at its centre. The fibres of which it is composed have • a concentric arrangement, [ more apparent at the circum- ■ ference than at the centre. Its surfaces are smooth. It divides the joint into two cavities, each of which is furnished with a synovial membrane.

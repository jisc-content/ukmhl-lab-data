847 THE THALAMUS thalamus by a flattened grey band, the middle or g)-ey commissure. This com- missure averages about one-third of an inch in its antero-posterior diameter : it sometimes consists of two parts and occasionaEy is absent. It contains nerve-cells and nerve-fibres : a few of the latter may cross the middle line, but most of them pass towards the middle line and tlien curve outwards on the same side. The external surface is in contact with a thick band of white matter which forms the posterior limb of the internal capsule and separates the thalamus from the lenticular nucleus of the corpus striatum. Structure.—The thalamus consists chiefly of grey matter, but its upper surface is covered by a layer of white matter, named the stratum zonale, and its outer surface by a similar layer termed the external medullary lamina.

The anterior part comprises the anterior tubercle, the inner part lies next the lateral wall or the tiurd ventricle, while the outer and largest part is interposed between tne internal and external medullary laminse and includes the pulvinar. The outer part is traversed by numerous fibres which radiate from the thalamus mto the mtemal capsule, and pass through the latter to the cerebral cortex, inese three parts are built up of numerous nuclei, the connections of many ot which are imperfectly known. Connections.—The thalamus may be regarded as a large ganglionic nass in which the ascending tracts of the tegmentum and a considerable proportion of the fibres of the optic tract end, and from the cells of whicli

371 MOVEMENTS ADMITTED IN JOINTS Synarthrosis, or Immovable Joint. Surfaces separated by fi- brous membrane or cartilage,with- out any inter- \ening synovial cavity, and im- movably con- nected M'ith each other. As in joints of cranium and face (except the mandible). A mphiarthrosis, Mixed Articula- tion. Sutura. Ar- ticulation by processes and indentations interlocked to- gether. Sutura vera (true) articulates by indented bor- ders. Sutura notha (false) articulates by rough sur- faces. / dentata, having tooth - like processes ; as in interparietal su- ture. serrata, having ser- rated edges like the \ teeth of a saw; as in interfrontal suture. limhosa, having be- velled margins, and dentated processes; as j in fronto-parietal su- \ ^ ture. squamosa, formed by thin bevelled mar- gins, overlapping each other ; as in squamo- parietal suture. harmonia, formed by the apposition of contiguous rough sur- faces ; as in inter- maxillary suture. Schindylesis.—Articulation formed by the reception of a thin plate of one bone into a fissure in another; as in articulation of rostrum of sphenoid with vomer. Gomphosis.—Articulation formed by the msertion of a conical process mto a socket; as in the teeth. Synchondrosis.—When the connecting medium is carti- lage, as in the occipito-sphenoid jouit. Symphysis.—Surtaces connected by fibro-cartilage, not separated by synovial membrane, and having limited motion; as m joints between bodies of vertebrte. ° Syndesmosis.Surtsices united by an interosseous liga- ment. As in the inferior tibio-fibular articulation. Ginglymus.—Hinge-joint; motion limited to two direc- tions, forwards and backwards. Articular surfaces fitted together so as to permit of movement in one plane ; as m the mterphalangeal jomts and the joint between the humerus and the ulna. Trochoid or pivot-joint.—Aiticnlation by a pivot-process turmng within a ring, or a ring round a pivot; as in superior radio-uhiar articulation, and atlanto-axial joint. Condyloid.—Ovoid head received into elliptical cavity Movements m every direction except axial rotation : as the wnst-joint. Reciprocal Reception {saddle-joint).—Opposed articular surfaces reciprocally convex m one direction and concave m the other. Movement in every direction but no axial rotation ; as in the carpo-metacarpal joint of the thumb Enarthrosis.—BaM-and-socket joint; capable of motion in all directions. Articulation by a globular head received mto a cup-like cavity; as in hip- and shoulder-jomts. Arthrodia. — Gliding-joint; articulation by plane sm-- faces which glide upon each other; as in the carpal and tarsal articulations. • witwf n?^? movement in which a bone moves round a central axis sepSehon!^°'''^t''^ ^^^^^^} displacement; the axis of rotation may lie in a vertebra around VkT^ ^"""^"^ «f ^^is lonXdinal ax^ '^^'^^ J^" ^^^l^ °^ ^ bone may rotate around its own arifof rotatioT;.!v'' ^^J^*^*^^^ °f the humerus at the shoulder-joint; or the rotation may not be qmte parallel to the long axis of the bone, as in the B B 2 .

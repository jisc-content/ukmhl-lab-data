EMBRYOLOGY 108 fore-gut and the exterior. In gill-bearing animals these septa disappear, and the grooves become complete clefts—the gill-clefts—opening from the pharynx on to the exterior ; perforation, however, does not occur in birds or mammals. The clefts separate a series of rounded bars or arches, the visceral arches, in which thickening of the mesoderm takes place (figs. 135, 1-36, 137). The dorsal ends of these arches are attached to the sides of the head, while the ventral extremities ultimately meet in the middle line of the neck. In all, five arches make their appearance, but of these Fig. 135.—Embryo between eighteen and twenty-one days. (His.)

The first arch is named the mandibular ; the second, the hyoid; the third, the thyro - hyoid (fig. 137) ; while the others have no distinctive names, but are referred to as the fourth and fifth visceral arches. In each arch a cartilaginous bar, consisting of right and left halves, is developed, and with each of these there is one of the primitive aortic arches. The mandibular arch Ues between the first vis- ceral cleft and the stoma- todaeum, and is developed into the lower Up and mandible. Its cartilaguaous bar is formed by what are known as Meckel's cartilages (right and left, fig. 138). The dorsal ends of these cartilages are connected mth the periotic capsules and are ossified to form two of the bones of the middle ear, the malleus and incus ;* the ventral ends meet each other in the region of the symphysis menti, and are usually regarded as undergomg ossification to form that portion of the mandible which contains the incisor teeth. The intervening part of the cartilage disappears; the portion immediately adja- cent to the malleus and Fig. 136.—The floor of the pharynx of a human embryo Body-stalk incus is replaced by fibrous membrane, and constitutes the spheno - mandibular ligament, while from the connective tissue covering the remainder of the carti- lage the greater part of the mandible is ossified. The second or hyoid arch assists in forming the side and front of the neck. From its cartilage are developed the styloid process, stylo- hyoid ligament, and lesser cornu of the hyoid bone.

389 STERNO-COSTAL ARTICULATIONS The Posterior Chondro-sternal Ligaments are also parts of the capsular licraments, but are less thick and distinct tlian the anterior ; they are composed of fibres which radiate from the posterior sui-faces of the sternal ends of the cartilages of the true ribs to the posterior surface of the sternum, becoming blended with the periosteum. The Interarticular Chondro-sternal Ligaments (ligg. stemocostaUa interarticularia).—These are found constantly only between the second costal Fig. 438.—Stemo-costal and interchondral articulations. Anterior view. The synovial cavities exposed by t ca.rtilages and the sternimi. The cartilage of the second rib is connected ' with the sternum by means of an interarticular ligament, attached by one t extremity to the cartilage of the rib, and by the other to the fibro-cartilage ) which unites the first and second pieces of the sternum. This articulation ' P^'oyided with two synovial membranes. Occasionally the cartilage of I the third rib is connected with the sternum by means of an interarticular 1 ligament which is attached by one extremity to the cartilage of the rib, and by

ANGIOLOGY 782 The elands of the hepatic chain (lymphoglandulie hepaticae) (fig. 662) consist of the following groups : (a) hevatic, on the stem of the hepatic artery and extending upwards along the common bile-duct, between the two layers'of the gastro-liepatic omentum, as far as the transverse fissure of the liver • tlie cystic gland, a member of this group, is placed near the neck of the c^all-bladder; (6) subpijloric, four or five in number, m close relation to the bifurcation of the gastro-duodenal artery, in the angle between the hrst and second parts of the duodenum ; an outlying member of tins group is sometimes found above the duodenum on the pyloric artery; (c) right gastro- evivloic (lymphoglandul* gastricse inferiores), four to seven in nuniber, betA\-een the two layers of the great omentum, along the pyloric half of the greater curvature of the stomach. The glands of the hepatic cham receive afferents from the stomach, duodenum, liver, gaU-bladder, and pancreas ; their efferents join the coeliac group of pre-aortic glands.

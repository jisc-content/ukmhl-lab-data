ORGANS OP SPECIAL SENSE 1040 externally by the membrana tympani and meatus ; internally, by the outer wall of the internal ear ; it communicates, behind, with tlie mastoid antrum and through it with the mastoid cells, and in front with the Eustacliian tube. The roof (paries tegmentalis) is broad, flattened, and formed of a thin plate of bone [tegmen tympani), which separates the cranial and tympanic cavities. It is situated on the anterior surface of the petrous portion of tlie temporal bone close to its angle of junction with the squamous portion of the same bone, and is prolonged backwards so as to roof in the mastoid antrum ; it is also carried forwards to cover in the canal for the Tensor tympani muscle. Its outer edge corresponds with the remains of the petro-squamous sutui-e. The floor (paries jugularis) is naiTow, and is separated by a thin plate of bone {fundus ttjmpani) from the jugular fossa. It presents, near the inner wall, a small aperture for the passage of Jacobson's nerve. The outer wall (paries membranacea) is formed mainly by the membrana tympani, partly by the ring of bone uito which this membrane is inserted. Fig; 858.â€”Coronal section of right temporal bone.

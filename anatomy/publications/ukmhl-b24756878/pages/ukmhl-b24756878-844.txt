NEUROLOGY 826 hemispheres. On the upper surface of the cerebellum tlie vermis is elevated above the level of the hemispheres, but on the under surface it is sunk almost out of sio-ht in the bottom of a deep depression between them ; this depression is called the vallecula cerebelli, and lodges the medulla oblongata. The part of the vermis which lies on the upper surface of the cerebellum is named the superior vermis ; that on the lower surface, the inferior vermis. Below and behind the hemispheres are separated by a deep notch, the posterior cerebellar notch (incisura cerebeUi posterior), and in front by a broader shaUower notch the anterior cerebellar notch (incisura cerebelli anterior). The anterior notch lies close to the pons and upper part of the medulla, and its upper edge encircles the lower pair of corpora quadrigemina and the superior peduncles of the cerebellum. The posterior notch contains the upper part ot a tola ot dura mater, the falx cerebelli. „ ,. , j The cerebeUum is characterised by its lammated or fohated appearance: it is marked by deep, somewhat curved fissures, which he close together, and extend for a considerable distance uito its substance, dividmg it mto a series of layers or leaves. The largest and deepest fissure is named the greai horizhntal fissure (sulcus horizontalis cerebelh). It commences m front at the pons, and passes horizontally round the ree margm of the l^^misphere to the middle line behind, and divides the cerebellum mt^ an upper and ^lo^^^r po^tion^ Several secondary but deep fissures separate the cerebellum mto lobes, and Se are further subdivided by shaUower sulci, which separate the mdividual fohl or lamin^B from each other.

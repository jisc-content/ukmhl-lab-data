NEUROLOGY 948 Thoracic Nerves (fig. 792) The internal branches of the posterior divisions of the upper six thoracic nerves run inwards between the Semispinalis dorsi and Multifidus spinae, which they supply ; they then pierce the Rhomboidei and Trapezius and reacli the skin by the sides of the spmous processes. The internal branches of the lower six are distributed chiefly to the Multifidus spinae and Longissimus dorsi; occasionally they give off filaments to the skin near the middle luie. The external branches increase in size from above downwards, ihey run through or beneath the Longissimus dorsi to the interval between it and the Ilio-costalis, and supply these muscles ; the lower five or six also give ott cutaneous branches which pierce the Serratus posticus inferior and Latissimus dorsi in a line with the angles of the ribs. The external branches of a variable number of the upper thoracic nerves also give filaments to the skin. The internal cutaneous branches of the posterior primary divisions of the thoracic nerves descend for some distance close to the spinous processes before reachmg the skm, while the external branches travel downwards for a considerable distance-it may be as much as the breadth of four ribs-before they become superficial ; the branch fro^ the Iwelfth thoracic, for instance, reaches the skm only a little way above the ihac crest. Lumbar Nerves The internal branches of the posterior divisions of the lumbar nenje^ pass inwards close to the articular processes of the vertebr* and end in the Multifidus spinse. j'jQ^ 793.â€”The posterior primary divisions of the sacral nerves.

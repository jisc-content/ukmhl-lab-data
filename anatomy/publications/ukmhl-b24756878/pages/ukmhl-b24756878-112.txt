EMBRYOLOGY 94 cavity After the fusion of the edges of the amniotic fold, the two layers of the fold become completely separated, the inner formmg the amnion, the outer the false amnion or serosa (fig. 116). The space between the ammon and the serosa constitutes the extra-embryonic coelom, already referred to, and for a time communicates with the embryonic ccelom or primitive pleuro-peritoneal oa^^ty. In the human embryo the earliest stages of the formation of the ammon have not been observed ; in the youngest embryo which has been studied the ammon was already present as a closed sac (figs. 117, 123). As indicated on page 86, the primitive amniotic cavity which appears in the inner cell mass is probably retained in the human embryo, as in that of the bat, to form the permanent ammofc cavity This cavity is roofed in by a single stratum of flattened ectodennal cel ., the Lniolic ectoderm, and its floor consists of the prismatic ectoderm of the embryonic disc-the continuity between the prismatic embryomc ectoderm and tbe Ittened amniotic ectodemi being estabbshed at the margm of the embryo,^^^^^ area Outside the amniotic ectoderm is a thin layer of mesoderm, wluch separates It from the chorionic ectoderm or trophoblast and is continuous witb the mesoderm of th^body-stalk and witb the somatic mesoderm of the embryo Mall suggests that the human amnion may be formed by an mversion of the blastoderm.

Running obliquely downwards and inwards from the summit of the great tro- chanter on the posterior surface of the neck is a very prominent ridge, the posterior intertro- chanteric line (crista intertro- chanterica). Its upper half forms the posterior border of the great troclianter, and its lower half runs downA\ ards and mwards to the upper and back part of the lesser trochanter. A slight ridge is sometimes seen commencing about the middle of the posterior intertrochanteric line, and passing vertically do\™wards for about two inches along the back part of the shaft: it is called the linea quadrata, and gives attachment to the Quadratus femoris and a few fibres of the Adductor magnus. Generally tliere is merely a slight thickening about tlie middle of the intertrochanteric line, marking the attachment of the upper part of the Quadratus femoris. This is termed by some anatomists the tubercle of the Quadratus. The shaft (corpus femoris) is almost cylindi-ical in form, but is a little broader above than in the centre, broadest and some- what flattened from before back- wards below. It is slightly arched, so as to be convex in front, and concave behind, where it is strengthened by a promi- nent longitudinal ridge, the linea aspera. It presents for examina- tion three borders, separating three surfaces. Of the three borders, one, the linea aspera, is posterior ; the other two are placed laterally. The li7iea aspera (fig. 388) is a prominent longitudinal ridge or crest, on the middle thu-d of the bone, presenting an inner and an outer lip, and a nar- row, rough, intermediate space. Above, the linea aspera is pro- longed by three ridges. The external ridge is very rough, and runs almost vertically upwards to the base of the great trochanter. It is termed FEMUR 335 Fig. 388.—Right femior. Posterior surface. ligament

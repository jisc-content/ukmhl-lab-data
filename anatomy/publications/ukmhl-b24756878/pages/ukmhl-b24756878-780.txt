7(52 ANGIULUUY pancreas, below the splenic artery, and terminates behind the neck oi the pancreas by uniting at a right angle witl\ the superior mesenteric to form the portal vein. The splenic vein is of large sixe, but is not tortuous like the artery. Tributaries.—The splenic vein receives the short gastnc veins, the left gastro-epiploic vein, the pancreatic veins, and the inferior mesenteric veins. (a) The short gastric veins (vv. gastrica? breves), some four or five in number, drain the fundus and left part of the greater curvature of the stomach, and pass between the two layers of the gastro-splenic omentum to terminate in the splenic vein or in one of its large tributaries. (6) The left gastro-epiploic vein (v. gastroepiploica sinistra) receives branches from the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach and from the great omentum ; it runs from right to left along the greater curvature of the stomach and ends m the commencement of the splenic vein. , i • , (c) The pancreatic veins (w. pancreatic^) consist of several small vessels which drain the body and tail of the pancreas, and open into the trunk of the splemc ^^^^(d) The inferior mesenteric vein (v. mesenterica inferior) returns blood from the rectum, and the pelvic, ihac, and descending parts of the colon. It begins in the rectum as the swperior hcemorrhoidal vein (v. hsemorrhoidahs superior), which has its origm in the hsemorrhoidal plexus, and through this plexus communicates with the middle and inferior hfemorrhoidal veins. The superior hsemorrhoidal vem leaves the pelvis and crosses the ihac vessels m company with the superior hemorrhoidal artery, and is continued upwards as the mferior mesenteric vein. This vein hes to the left of the inferior mesenteric artery, and ascends behmd tne peritoneum and ha front of the left Psoas ; it then passes behmd the body of the pancreas and opens mto the splenic vein ; sometimes it ternunates m the angle ot union of the splenic and superior mesenteric veius. Tributaries.—The mferior mesenteric vem receives the sigmoid veins (vv. sigmoideae) from the ilio-pelvic colon and the left colic vein (v. cohca sinistra) from the descending colon and splenic flexure. The superior mesenteric vein (v. mesenterica superior) returns the blood from the smaU intestine, and from the cecum and the ascending and transverse portions of the colon. It begms in the right iliac fossa by the union of the veSirwhich drain the terminal part of the ilium, the cecum and verm^ forrn appendix, and ascends between the two layers of ^^-^^^^^^t nasses right side of the superior mesenteric artery.

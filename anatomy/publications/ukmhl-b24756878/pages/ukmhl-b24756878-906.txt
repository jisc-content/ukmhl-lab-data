888 NEUKOLOGY The ititraparietal fissure begins on a level with the junction of the middle and lower third of the fissure of" Rolando, on a line carried across the head from the back of the root of one auricle to that of the other. After passing upwards, it curves backwardfi, lying parallel to the longitucUnal Hssure, midway between it and the parietal emmonce ; it then curves downwards to end midway between the lambda and the parietal emmenco. The lateral ventricles may be circumscribed, according to Poirier, by describing a nuadrilatoral figure on the side of the head. The upper Umit is a honzontal lino drawn two inches above and parallel ^v'ith the zygoma: this defines the roof of the ventricular cavity The lower limit is a second horizontal Une drawn half an mch above the zygoma : this indicates the level of the extremity of the descending horn of the ventricle. Two vertical lines—one drawn through the junction of the anterior and middle thu:ds of the zygomatic arch, and the other two mches behmd the tip of the mastoid process—mdicate the extent of the anterior horn m front and the posterior horn behind. Avvlied Anatomy.—Hho internal ca'psule is of gi-eat mterest to the clmician because it is so often the seat of heemon-hage (from the lenticulo-striate and lenticulo-optic arteries, Charcot's ' arteries of cerebral hemorrhage '), or of thrombosis, m patients ^'^ose vessek are weakened by old age or disease. A ' stroke,' or ' apoplexy is the result; blood is effused from the ruptured vessel and tears up the surroundmg brain tLssue, and also mterferes with the neighbourmg fibres by the compression set up by its mass. If the hamoirhage s ^dden andlt all large, rapid and complete loss of consciousness foUows ^"^^h P-rdy«s of the opposite side of the body and loss of control over the sphincters.

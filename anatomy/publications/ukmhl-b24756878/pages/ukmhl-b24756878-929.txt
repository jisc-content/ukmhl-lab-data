FIFTH CRANIAL NERVE 911 sympatlietic root, is a slender filament from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic. This is frequently blended with the long root, though it sometimes passes to the ganglion separately. According to Tiedemann, this ganglion receives a filament of communication from the spheno-palatine ganglion. Its branches of distribution are the short ciliary nerves (nn. ciliares breves). Tliese are delicate filaments, from six to ten in number, which arise from the fore part of the ganglion in two bundles comiected with its superior and inferior angles ; the lower bundle is the larger. They run forwards with the ciliary arteries in a wavy com-se, one set above and the other below the optic nerve, and are accompanied by the long cihary nerves from the nasal. They pierce the sclera at the back part of the globe, pass forwards in delicate grooves on its inner surface, and are distributed to the Ciliary muscle, iris, and cornea. Tiedemann has described one small branch as penetrating the optic nerve with the arteria centralis retinae. Superior Maxillary Nerve (fig. 770) The Superior maxillary nerve (n. maxillaris), or second division of the fifth, IS a sensory nerve. It is mtermediate, both in position and size, between the ophthalmic and inferior maxillary. It commences at the middle of the Gasserian ganglion as a flattened plexiform band, and, passing horizontally forwards, it leaves the skull through the foramen rotundum, where it becomes more cylindrical in form, and firmer in texture. It then crosses the spheno- maxillary fossa, inclines outwards on the back of the maxUla, and enters the orbit tlirough the spheno-maxillary fissure ; it traverses the mfraorbital gi-oove and canal m the floor of the orbit, and appears upon the face at the infraorbital foramen.* At its termmation, the nerve lies beneath the Levator labii superioris muscle, and divides mto a leash of branches which spread out upon the side of the nose, the lower eyelid, and the upper lip, joming with filaments of the facial nerve. Branches of distribution.—The branches of this nerve may be divided into four groups, according as they are given off in the cranium, in the spheno- maxillary fossa, in the infraorbital canal, or on the face.

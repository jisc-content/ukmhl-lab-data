THE VASCULAR SYSTEM 63 On account of the peculiar arrangement of the framework of the organ, the I xnd-pulp in the cortical portion is disposed in the form of nodules, and m the ledullary part in the form of rounded cords. It consists of ordmary lymphoid Fig. 81.—Follicle from a lymphatic gland of the dog, in vertical section. a. lletioiilar sustentacular substance o£ the more external portion. 6, of the more internal, and e, of the most external and most finely webbed part on the s\irface o{ the follicle, d.

In its meshes are closely packed lymph-corpuscles, traversed by a dense plexus of capillary blood-vessels. The nodules or follicles in Fig. 83.—Section of lymphatic-gland tissue. n. Trabeculic. b.

These areas are termed germ-centres (fig. 80). The cells .composing them are smaller than the peripheral cells, and often stain less intensely.

NEUROLOGY 840 groups. Tlie iibies of the posterior group arise in the temporal and occipital lobes, and occupy the outer fifth of the crusta ; while those of the anterior group take origin in the frontal lobe, and are disseminated among the pyramidal and geniculate fibres. On the dorsal aspect of the cortico-pontine fibres a strand of the mesial fillet passes up in the crusta.* The substantia nigra is a layer of grey matter containing numerous deeply pigmented, multipolar nerve-ceUs. Like the crusta, it is semilunar on trans- verse section, its concavity being directed towards the tegmentum ; from its convex aspect, prolongations extend doAxnwards between the fibres of tli< crusta. Thicker internally than externally, it reaches from the oculo-motoi sulcus to the lateral sulcus, and extends from the upper surface of the pons to the subthalamic region ; its inner part is traversed by the fibres of the thu-d nerve as these stream forwards to reach the oculo-motor sulcus. The connec- tions of the substantia nigra have not been definitely established. The tegmentum is contmuous below with the reticular formation ot tlie pons, and, like it, consists of longitudinal and transverse fibres, together with a considerable amount of grey matter.

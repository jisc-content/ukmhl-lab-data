ANGiOLUClY 74:8 The right innominate vein is a short vessel, an inch in length, %yhich commences at the inner end of the clavicle, and, passing almost vertically downwards, joins with the left innominate vein just below the cartilage of the first rib. close to the right border of the sternum, to form the suioerior vena cava. It lies superficial and external to the innominate artery ; on its right side is the phrenic nerve, and the pleura is here interposed between it and the apex of the lung. This vein, at the angle of junction of the internal jugular with the subclavian, receives the right vertebral vein ; and, lower down, the right internal mammary, right inferior thyroid, and sometimes the right superior intercostal veins. The left innominate vein, about two and a half inches m length, and larger than the right, passes from left to right across the upper part and front of the chest, at the same time inclining downwards, to unite with its fellow of the opposite side, and form the superior vena cava. It is in relation, m front, with the manubrium sterni, from which it is separated by the Sterno- hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, the thymus gland or its remams, and some loose areolar tissue. Behmd it are the three large arteries arising from the arch of the aorta, together with the vagus and phrenic nerves. This vessel is joined by the left vertebral, left internal mammary, left mfenor thyroid, and the left superior intercostal veins, and occasionally some thymic and pen- cardiac veins. There are no valves m the innominate veins. Peculiarities.—Som&tim.&s the innominate veins open separately into the right auricle ; ia such cases the right vem takes the ordmary course of the superior vena cava : but tne left vem—left siiperior vena cava, as it is termed-after commumcatmg by a smaU brancli ^yith the right one, passes m front of the root of the left lung, and turning to the back of the heart, receives the cardiac vems, and terminates in the back of the right auricle. Ihis occasional condition in the adult is due to the persistence of the early fcetal condition, and is the normal state of things in birds and some mammalia. The internal mammary veins (w. mammarise mtemse), two to each mternal mammary artery, follow the course of that vessel, and recei%'e tributaxies corre- sponding to its branches. The two veins unite into a single trunk, which terminates in the corresponding innominate vem.

850 NEUROLOGY ventricle, viz. the corpora mamillaria, tuber cinereum, infundibulum, pituitary body, and optic commissure. _ . . ^ t i?ho subthalamic tegmental region consists of the upward contmuation ot the tegmentum, which Ues on the ventro-lateral aspect of the thalamus and separates it from the fibres of the internal capsule. Tlie red nucleus and tlie substantia nigra arc prolonged into its lower part; m front it is contmuous with the substantia innominata of Meynert, internally with tlie grey matter of the floor of the third ventricle. . . j 7. It consists from above downwards of tliree strata : (1) slralum dorsale, directly apphed to the under surface of tlie thalamus and consisting of hne longitudinal fibres ; (2) zona incerta, a continuation forwards of the formatio reticularis of the tegmentum ; and (3) the corpus suUhalamicum or nucleus of Lmjs, a brownish mass presenting a lenticular shape on transverse section and situated on the dorsal aspect of the fibres of the crusta ; it is encapsuled Fig 721.â€”Mesial sagittal section of brain.

1098 SPLANCHNOLOGY The mairix is translucent, and contains the cliicf part of the earthy matter of the dentine. In it arc a number of fine fibrils, which are continuous with the fibrils of the dental pulp. After the earthy matter has been removed by steeping a tooth in weak acid, the animal basis remaining may be torn into lamina) which run parallel with the pulp cavity, across the direction of the tubes. A section of di-y dentine often displays a series of somewhat parallel lines—the incremenkil lines of Sailer. These lines are com])osed of imperfectly calcified dentine arranged in layers. In consequence of the imperfection in the calcifying process, little ii-regular cavities are left, termed interglobular spaces (spatia interglobularia). Normally a series of these spaces is found towards the outer surface of the dentine, where they form a layer, which is sometimes kno^vn as the granular layer (tig. 907). They have received their name from the fact that they are siu-rounded by mfnute nodules or globules of dentine. Other curved Imes may be seen parallel to the surface. These are the lines of Schreger, and are due to the optical effect of simultaneous curvature of the dentinal fibres. Chemical Composition.—^According to Berzelius and von Bibra, dentine consists of 28 parts of animal and 72 of earthy matter. The animal matter is converted by boiling into gelatin. The earthy matter consists of phosphate of lime, carbonate of lime, a trace of fluoride of calcium, phosphate of magnesia, and other salts. The enamel (substantia adamantina) is the hardest and most compact part of the tooth, and forms a thin crust over the exposed part of the crown, as far as Fig. 908.—Transverse section of a portion of the root of a canine tooth. (Magnified 300 diameters.) = Cement 2 Interglobulai '^1 spaces Dentine the commencement of the fang. It is thickest on the grinding surface of the crown, until worn away by attrition, and becomes thinner towards the neck. It consists of minute hexagonal rods or columns termed enamel fibres or enamel prisons (prismata adamantina). They lie parallel wdth one another, resting by one extremity upon the dentine, which presents a number of minute depressions for theii- reception ; and forming the free surface of the crown by the other extremity. The columns are dii-ected vertically on the summit of the crown, horizontally at the sides; they are about of an inch in diameter, and pursue a more or less wavy course. Each column is a six-sided prism and presents numerous dark transverse shadings; these shadings are probably due to the manner in which the columns are developed in successive stages, producing shallow constrictions, as will be sub- sequently explained. Another series of lines, having a brown appearance, the parallel slrim or coloured lines of Retzius, is seen on section. According to Ebncr, they are produced by air in the inter- prismatic spaces ; others believe that they are the result of true pigmentation. Numerous minute interstices intervene between the enamel fibres near their dentina ends, a provision calculated to allow of the permeation of fluids from the dentmal tubule into the substance of the enamel. , Chemical Composition.-kooovAing to von Bibra, ename cons sts « f P^^j^^"^ of earthy matter, and 3-5 per cent, of animal matter.* The earthy "^"^^ ° phosphate of lime, with traces of fluoride of calcuim, carbonate of Imie, phosphate ot '^^'Si::tXosto^ c^ner^i (substantia ossea), is f^osf -^^'^^X^^^^^ roots of the teeth, from the termination of the enamel to the apex of it is usually very thick.

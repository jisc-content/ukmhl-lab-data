1169 THE LIVER The fibrous coal lies beneath the serous investment, and covers the entire siui'ace of the organ. It is difficult of demonstration, excepting where the serous coat is deficient. At the transverse fissure it is continuous «dth the capsule of Glisson, and. on the surface of the organ, with the areolar tissue separating the lobules. The lobules (figs. 962, 963) form the chief mass of the hepatic substance; they may be seen either on the surface of the organ, or by making a section through the gland, as small Fig. 962.—Longitudinal section of an Fio. 963—Longitudinal section of a small hepatic vein.

OrificeH of intralobular vaiits granular bodies, about the size of a millet seed, measuring fi-om one-twentieth tolone-tenth of an inch in diameter. In the human subject their outlines are very irregular; but in some of the lower animals (for example, the pig) they are well defined, and, when divided transversely, have polygonal outlines. The bases of the lobules are clustered round the smallest radicles (sublobular) of the hepatic veins, to which each is connected by means of a small branch which issues from the centre of the lobule {intralobular).

Iniralohular vein surface of each lobule is imperfectly isolated from the surrounding lobules by a thin stratum of areolar tissue, in which is contained a plexus of vessels (the interlobular plexus) and ducts. In some animals, as the pig, the lobules are completely isolated from one another by the interlobular areolar tissue. If one of the sublobular veins be laid open, the bases of the lobules may be seen through the thin wall of the vein on which they rest, arranged in a form resembling a tesselated 4 F

ANGIOLOGY 780 The common iliac glands, four to sLx in number, are grouped in relation to the lateral and deep aspects of the common iliac artery, one or two being placed below the bifurcation of the aorta, in front of the fifth lumbar vertebra. They drain chiefly the internal and external iliac glands, and their effer(5nts pass to the lateral aortic glands. The lumbar glands (tymphoglandula; lumbales) are very numerous, and consist of right and left lateral aortic, pre-aortic, and retro-aortic groups. The right lateral aortic glands are situated partly in front of the inferior vena cava, near the termination of the renal vein, and partly behind it on the origin of the Psoas, and on the right crus of the Diaphragm. The lejt lateral aortic glands form a chain on the left side of the abdominal aorta in front of the origin of the Psoas and left crus of the Diaphragm. The glands on either side receive (a) the efferents of the common iliac glands, (b) the lymphatics from the testicle in the male and from the ovary, FaUopian tube, and body Fig. 661.—Ilio-pelvic glands (lateral view).

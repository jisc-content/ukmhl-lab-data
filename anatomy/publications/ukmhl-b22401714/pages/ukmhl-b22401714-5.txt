PREFACE. In submitting for Sale by Auction the Property to which this Catalogue refers, it may be considered needless to expatiate on the value and importance of such a collection, which, it may be affirmed, is equal, if not superior, to any other formed by an individual in this country. The acknowledged skill and ability of the late Mr. Heaviside, and his exten- sive acquirements in the various branches of his profession, render any observations on those points quite superfluous. To many the contents of this highly interesting and valuable Museum are well known; but to those who have not been favored with an inspection, it may be only requisite to assure them that the whole of the subjects are pre- pared in the most scientific manner, and are all in an excellent state of pre- servation. As willâ€™be seen by reference to the Catalogue, the Collection consists of an immense variety of Natural and Morbid Preparations, parti- cularly the latter; and among them will be found every part of the human body both male and female; adult and foetal skeletons; skulls, &c.: Bones of every description, natural and morbid, showing the destructive ravages that the venereal and other diseases have on them: very beautiful and rare specimens of Comparative Anatomy and of Natural History; with a great variety of Monstrosities in the human and brute Creation : together with Models and Casts of every description. The Collection is considerably enhanced by having a most complete descriptive Catalogue, made by Mr. Heaviside himself, not, however, with the remotest idea of its being used for the purpose of sale, but as an accurate and faithful description of each preparation; there are also statements in his own writing of the various Cases to which he had attended, together with

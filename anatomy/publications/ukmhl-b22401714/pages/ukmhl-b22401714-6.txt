2 their Treatment, many of which are the identical subjects in this Museum : to the purchasers of such preparations, these statements, or copies of them, will be delivered. The whole will be sold in the exact condition in which they were left by Mr. Heaviside ; and, on this account, it has been deemed expedient not to alter or even reprint the Catalogue made by him. The “ Index to the Arrange' ment of the Sale,” which accompanies the Catalogue, points out the various articles in the order they will be sold, in some instances three or four prepa- rations being put into one lot, where it is presumed their connexion with each other render it advisable not to separate them. To Gentlemen who are in possession of the Descriptive Catalogue above alluded to, of which many copies were circulated during the lifetime of Mr. Heaviside, the Index will prove a sufficient guide for the sale; and for this purpose, a number of extra copies have been printed, which may be had separately, on application to WHEATLEY AND ADLAIID, Auctioneers, 191, Piccadilly, Londo . July 15, 1829.

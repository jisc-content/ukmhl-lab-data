24 KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE whole external skin, and that almost all the particles of the liquid are separated from the air, only by very thin membranous pellicles, which do not obstruct its actions. To respiration there are appropriate mus- cular organs, which attract or impel the ambient fluid, to or from the place where it is to act upon the blood. The blood, in its passage through the organ of respiration, undergoes a change, which removes a part of its carbon, carrying it off in the form of carbonic acid, and thereby augments the proportion of its other elements. The ef- fect of this process, on the respired air, is a loss of its oxygenâ€”the aeriform fluid which is peculiarly serviceable in respira- tion. Its effect on the blood is less under- stood : we only know that it heightens its colour in red-blooded animals, and seems necessary to its exciting the heart to con- tract. It appears also that this action of

8 KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE ing of nervous particles, in its transmitting impressions from external objects or per- forming nervous action, and in that action being altogether invisible. Thus, each of these classes of organs is distinguished from another by the struc- ture of its parts, by the purposes which it serves, and by the greater or less obvi- ousness of its motions. The first consists of levers ; the second of cylindrical tubes ; and the third of nervous particles. The first performs motion from place to place, or locomotion; the second transmits and transmutes liquids, or performs vascular action ; and the third transmits impressions from external objects, or performs nervous action. The motion of the first is extreme- ly obvious ; that of the second is barely ap- parent; and that of the third is altogether invisible

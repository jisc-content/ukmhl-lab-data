LAWS OF FEMALE BEAUTY. 267 in me7i were either reprovedfor this practice, or not co%intenanced in it. What a contrast to modern opinion! Yet, on the subject of courtezans, we agree with the latter, as is seen in the pre- ceding section. In modern times, indeed, and since the discovery of America in par- ticular, the use of courtezans has become much more immoral. Referring to the unmarried woman, let us conclude with the immortal lines of Ca- tullus : Ut flos in septis secretis nascitur hortis, Ignotus pecori, nullo contusus aratro. Quern mulcent aurae, firmat sol, educat imber, Multi ilium pueri, multae cupiere puellae ; Idem cum tenui carptus defloruit ungui, Nulli ilium pueri, nullae cupiere puellae : Sic virgo, dum intacta manet, duin cara suis ; sed Cum castum amisit, pollute corpore, florem, Nec pueris jucunda manet, nec cara puellis.

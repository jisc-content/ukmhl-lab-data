DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES Not a Bene.â€”Plates lo, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 should not be carelessly exposed either to Ladies or to Young Persons. These Plates are therefore stitched up separately, and placed in a secret pocket cunningly hidden in one of the covers of the binding. As the work is a sciejitific one, and calculated both by its mode of construction and by its price for the higher and more reflecting class of readers, and as the Plates above enu- merated are also entirely scientific and anatomical, the Manager of The Walpole Press might have dispensed with this precaution ; but he is anxious that collectors and students should have it in their power to obviate the possibility of the careless exposure of such anatomi- cal Plates: they are therefore detached from the work, placed in the secret pocket as described, or they 'inay be, if thought more desirable, taken out of the pocket and locked up.

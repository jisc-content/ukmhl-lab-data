KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE 34 nations, light and aerial vibrations are the forms of matter which act on these four organs, the structure of each of which is appropriate to the nature of the forms which impress it. The tongue imbibes, by its spongy papillae, and distinguishes by its numerous nerves, the savory liquids which pass through the mouth. The nose per- mits a passage for the air to the lungs, and is impressed in that passage, by the odo- riferous vapours which it wafts. The eye presents to the light, transparent lenses which refract its rays. The ear opposes to the air, membranes and liquids which receive its concussions. Thus each organ of sense possesses a correct relation to the nature of the objects a knowledge of which it is used to convey to us. From each organ of sense proceeds in- ward one or more nerves to the brain.

LAWS OF FEMALE BEAUTY. I31 connected with chastity. The Arab women make modesty to consist in not being known when bathing. Without changing their posture, on the approach of passengers, they only cover their faces with their hands. This, says a traveller, 1 had occasion to re- mark in various little excursions which I made in .Syria. These, women, indeed, re- semble all the women of the earth, who, for the honour of their sex, require a great deal of respect from the men in public; but, at a private t^te-a-tete, are not always so modest. In temperate latitudes we hold in this respect a medium between the inhabitants of cold climates and those of warm ones: we do not shut up our ladies in harems ; neither do we treat them like the Lap- landers. .

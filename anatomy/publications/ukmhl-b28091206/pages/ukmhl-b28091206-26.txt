KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE 4 small.—The whole figure is soft and vo- luptuous in the extreme. Yet has she not the almost measured proportions and the brilliant air of the preceding species; nor has she any of the qualities of the succeed- ing one. III. We observe, then, a beauty of a third species:—Her high and pale forehead an- nounces the intellectuality of her charac- ter ; her intensely expressive eye is full of sensibility; a soft and pale light seems sometimes to be shed over her lower fea- tures, in which modesty and dignity are often united; she has neither the expanded bosom, nor the general embonpoint of the second species; and she boasts easy and elegant motion, rather than the fine pro- portion of the first.—The whole figure is characterized by intellectuality and grace.

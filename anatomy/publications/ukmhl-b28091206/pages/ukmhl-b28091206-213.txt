LAWS OF FEMALE BEAUTY. 159 double barrelled pistol. These corpora ca- vernosa join, throughout their length, at their inner sides, which thus form a sort of septum, while the two bodies themselves constitute the greater part of the penis, of which the upper part is called the dorsum. The corpora cavernosa are surrounded by an extremely strong ligamentous sheath. These bodies terminate at the back part or root of the glans, or extremity of the penis, which is invested by the loose skin termed prepuce. The cell of these cavernous bodies form ready communications with each other. They are also elastic and flexible, so that, on the penis becoming erect, they readily admit into their cells a considerable quantity of blood, from the pudic artery. The cells, thus filled with blood, enlarge the penis in all its dimen- sions, so that its flexibility is lost and it becomes rigid.

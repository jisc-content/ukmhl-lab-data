I l6 KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE Contending Boars with tusks enamell’d strike, And guard with shoulder-shield the blow oblique ; While female bands attend in mute surprise, And view the victor with admiring eyes. “So Knight on Knight, recorded in romance. Urged the proud steed, and couch’d the extended lance; He, whose dread prowess with resistless force, O’erthrew the opposing warrior and his horse, Bless’d, as the golden guerdon of his toils. Bow’d to the beauty and receiv’d her smiles. “ So when fair Helen wdth ill-fated charms. By Paris wooed, provoked the world to arms. Left her vindictive lord to sigh in vain For broken vows, lost love and cold disdain; Fired at his wrongs, associate to destroy The realms unjust of proud, adulterous Troy, Unnumber’d Heroes braved the dubious fight. And sunk lamented to the shades of night. “Now vows connubial chain the plighted pair, And join paternal with maternal care ; The married birds with nice selection cull Soft thistle-down, grey moss, and scattered wool. Line the secluded nest w'ith feathery rings. Meet with fond bills, and woo with fluttering wings.

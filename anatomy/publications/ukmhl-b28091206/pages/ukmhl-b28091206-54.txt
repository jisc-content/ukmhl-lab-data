22 KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE larger ones, and all ultimately terminate in a trunk, called the Thoracic Duct, which pours its liquid, mixed with all the aqueous matters which have been swallowed, into one of the great veins contiguous to the heart. The function, then, w'hich is thus performed, is the first of the vital functions, or that of Absorption. {See Plate V.) II. The liquid thus absorbed is destined to renew that blood, which has already circulatedâ€”the venous blood, and to ren- der it fit for the nutrition of the body. By the Veins, which, like the absorbents, are white, thin, transparent, apparently desti- tute of fibres and without pulsation, and like them too are supplied with valves, the blood, impregnated with carbon, and of a dark colour, passes to the heart. These vessels commence by minute origins from the capillary terminations of the arteries.

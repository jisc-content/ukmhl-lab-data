KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE 14 In short, digestion prepares the vital matter, which is taken up by absorption— the first of the simple vital functions; respiration renovates it in the very middle of its course—between the two portions of the simple function of circulation; and generation, dependent on secretion—the last of these functions, communicates this vital matter, or propagates vitality to a new series of beings. In such arrange- ment, the digestive organs, therefore, pre- cede, and the generative follow, the simple vital organs; while the respiratory oc- cupy a middle place between the veinous and the arterial circulation.

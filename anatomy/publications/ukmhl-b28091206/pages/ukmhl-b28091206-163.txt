LAWS OF FEMALE BEAUTY. 109 During the whole term of menstruation, women are weaker, more delicate, and more susceptible of impressions ; all their organs participate more or less in the af- fections of the uterus ; and it is not diffi- cult for an experienced observer to dis- tinguish this state by the stroke of the pulse, but still more by the alteration of the face and tone of the voice. Women at that time require the greatest care; an unnecessary venesection, a purge, or other medicine improperly administered, may suppress the evacuation, and occasion the most serious affections. We must remark, in a general sense, that the periodical flow of the menses seems to abstract females from many in- conveniences that are prevalent in our sex, as the gout and calculous affections, so unusual in them, and so frequent in us.

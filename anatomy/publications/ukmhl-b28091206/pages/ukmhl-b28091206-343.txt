LAWS OF FEMALE BEAUTY. 289 ot the good and moral Plutarch, as al- ready quoted, that when a certain degree of natural liberty was allowed to the Gre- cian women, they were less licentious than in after times, when that liberty was taken away. We must also admit, that, in modern times, and in our own country, there are innumerable instances in which men and women have indulged in tempo- rary and evanescent loves, without ever having seriously neglected their wives, husbands or families. There are few men, indeed, and far fewer women than is com- monly imagined, who have not indulged irregular pleasures ; and, if the number of abandoned, ruined or neglected families were as great as the number of husbands or wives who have sinned in this respect, this sin would undoubtedly be the most extensive and this calamity the heaviest, that England ever had to endure. u

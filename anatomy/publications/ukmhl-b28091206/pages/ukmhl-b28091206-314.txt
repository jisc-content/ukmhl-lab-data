26o KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE Aspasia, however, born at Miletus, the chief town of Ionia, was the first who in- troduced Asiatic elegance into Europe; but Athenseus declares, that her disciples were few among the noble dames, and that the courtezans only were eager in copying her dress and manners. The companions of Aspasia, however, served as models for painting and statuary, and themes for poetry and panegyric. Nor were they merely the objects, but the au- thors of many literary works, in which they established rules for the behaviour of their lovers, particularly at table, and ex- plained the art of gaining the heart, and captivating the affections; which would have been an imprudence, had they not considered, that the mysteries of their call- ing alone, lose little by being disclosed, since men may often perceive the snare, without having courage to avoid it.

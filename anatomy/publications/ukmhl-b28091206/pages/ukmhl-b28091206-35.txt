13 LAWS OF FEMALE BEAUTY. Compound, however, as the organs of digestion, respiration, and generation are, yet, as they form so important a part of the system, it may be asked, “ with which of these classes they are most allied ? ” The answer is obvious. All of them con- sist of tubular vessels of various diame- ter ; and all of them transmit and trans- mute liquids. Possessing such strong characteristics of the vital system, they are evidently most allied to it. involved by this arrangement; but such a notion can originate only in superficial observation. Digestion is a compound function easily reducible to some of the simple ones which I have enumerated. It consists of the motion of the stomach and contiguous parts, of the secretion of a liquid from its internal surface, and of that heat, which is the common result of all action, whether locomotive, vital, or intellectual, and which is better explained by such motion, than by chemical theories. Similarly compound are respiration and ge- neration. Thus there is no organ nor function which is not involved by the simple and natural arrangement here sketched.

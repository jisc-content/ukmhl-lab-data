KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE 210 diameter of its vessels augments with the thickness of its parietes ; the latter become softer, and their muscular nature is per- ceptible. Hence, it is, that too frequent excitement and the consequent callousness and want of tendency to adhesion (as well the perpetual disturbance of the process) in courtezans, causes generation to cease. In other cases, however, the favourable state of the uterus and the more powerful attraction of albumen for carbon, will pro- duce the desired adhesion with the arterial surface of the uterus. The attracted blood will then flow to the albumen. Now, albu- men united with carbon, forms fibrine. “ Fibrine,” says Thompson, “ appears to be composed of the same constituents as gelatine and albumen; but it probably contains more carbon and azote and less oxygen.” Hence, as the blood enters the

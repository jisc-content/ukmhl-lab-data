310 KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE repudiation, where children exist, can differ from those in which they do not ex- ist, only in requiring the consent of the nearest relativeâ€”on each side in divorce, and on the side of the injured party in re- pudiation. Such, then, seem to be the whole of the just and natural impediments which ought to be thrown in the way of divorce ; and, while the removal of the unjust and unna- tural restraints of a blind and barbarous legislation, would greatly diminish the sum of human misery, the just and natural restraints here proposed would guard, by the solemnity and sacredness of related consent, against the vice of loose connec- tions and licentious separations.

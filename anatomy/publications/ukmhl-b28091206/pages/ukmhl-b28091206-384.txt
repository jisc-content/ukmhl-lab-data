330 KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE DEFECTS OF THE INTELLECTUAL SYSTEM OF WOMEN. I. It is a defect of-the intellectual sys- tem, if THE HEAD, Compared with the trunk, be not less than that of the male ; because, the intellectual system in the fe- male, ought to be subordinate to the vital. 9. It is a defect, if the organ of SENSE be not proportionately larger, when compared with the brain, and more deli- cately outlined than in the male ; because, sensibility should exceed reasoning power in the female. 3. It is a defect, if the forehead be narrow, and more especially if it be low ; because, that part being the seat of obser- vation, if the organ be small, the function must be correspondingly so.

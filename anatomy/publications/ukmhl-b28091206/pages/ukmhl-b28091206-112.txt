KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE 64 ascendancy of his genius, woman acts on man by the seduction of her manners and by the continual observation of all that can engage his heart, or captivate his imagination. To effect this, it is these very qualities which enable her to accomo- date herself to his taste ; to yield without constraint, even to the caprice of the mo- ment ; and to seize the time, when obser- vations, made, as it were, accidentally, may produce their effect. Her highest duty is to please him to whom she has united her days, and to attach him to home by rendering it agreeable to him.â€” For many other moral and physical purposes, these qualities are not less es- sential.

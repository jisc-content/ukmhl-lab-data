36 KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE The impressions, then, which act on the organs of sense, and there produce sen- sations, ultimately reach the brain or sen- sorium commune, by means of certain nerves, and there constitute perception, or, in other words, have their influence diffus- ed from this central point, and rendered universally cognizable to the system. The CEREBRUM, then, performs the second of the intellectual functions, or that of mental operation, [See Plate XII.) Ill, These operations having termi- nated, the function of the cerebellum, placed under the posterior part of the cerebrum, ensues. Volition is the action of this organ; and is induced by the power of the passions. Hence volition must be implicitly dependent on Intellectual operation, as that is dependent on sensa- tion, and it again upon external impression.

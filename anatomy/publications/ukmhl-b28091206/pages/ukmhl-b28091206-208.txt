KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE 154 prostate gland. These bodies, adhering to the bladder, diverge at their upper part, and unite, in an angle, at their lower ; so that it thus is between them, in some mea- sure, that the rectum is here situate, and that a sort of depression may be observed on that part of the bladder. Each vesicula seminalis is composed, not of numerous cells, as they would seem to be, but of one continuous convoluted tube. It does not form a continuation of the vas deferens, for that tube only passes laterally along it, and it opens into the urethra, at the neck of the bladder, or commencement of the urethra. Between the opening from each vesicula, and at the middle of the prostate gland, is situate an eminence called caput gallinaginis or verumontanum ; and this body, it has been supposed, has the power of occasionally shutting each orifice of the vesicula.

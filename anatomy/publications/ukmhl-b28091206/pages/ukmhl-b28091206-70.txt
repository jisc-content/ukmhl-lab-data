28 KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE are the glands which separate the seminal liquid ; but several other glands prepare other liquids, which mingle with it. The penis contains the seminal canal, and. as it swells by the accumulation of blood when the animal is excited by desire, it is, by that means, rendered capable of penetrating the vagina, which leads to the matrix, and of conveying thither the liquid to vivify the ova. The oviduct receives the ovum, when it is detached from the ovarium, and con- ducts it into the matrix. The embryo is developed by nourishment derived from its mother, by means of the absorption per- formed by a large tissue of vesselsâ€”the placenta, connected with those of its own body. When the embryo has attained a certain state, the matrix expels it. {See Plate X. for external Views of these or- gans, and Plate X VII. and seq. for their Structure and Details?)

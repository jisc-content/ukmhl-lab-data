By the first kind, motion from place to place or mechanical action is effected ; by the second, nutrition or vital action is maintained ; and by the third, thought or intellectual action is per- mitted. Anatomy is, therefore, divided into three parts, namely, that which con- siders the mechanical or locomotive or- gans ; that which considers the vital or- gans ; and that which considers the intel- lectual organs. Under the mechanical or locomotive or- gans are classed, first, the bones, which support the rest of the animal structure ; second, the ligaments which unite them ; and third, the muscles which move them.

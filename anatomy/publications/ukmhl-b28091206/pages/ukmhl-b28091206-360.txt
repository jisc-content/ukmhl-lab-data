KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE 3o6 greatly complicated and obscured by the neglect of a discriminating and analytical examination. The consideration of chil- dren, in particular, has been introduced as affecting the whole question ; whereas, It can affect only one of Its cases. No con- sideration of children ought surely to en- hance the difficulty of divorce in cases where they do not exist ; and it is right, in the first instance, to discuss the subject of divorce, without reference to children,, because such an event may easily precede their procreation. Supposing, then, the non-existence of children, let us examine divorce as unem- barrassed by such a consideration. Divorce, then, seems naturally to be divided into divorce properly so called, and repudiation.

KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE LAWS OF FEMALE BEAUTY. CHAPTER II. OF LOVE. I SECTION I. Of the Origin and Influence of Love. Parent of Rome, propitious queen of love, Delight of men below, and gods above ; Who pour’st abroad thy life-diffusing soul To all that lies beneath the whirling pole ; The buoyant ocean owns thy genial powers.

KALOGVNOMIA, OR THE 6o chanical system to the changes we have alluded to, at the same time that it ob- literates the projection of muscles, and in- vests all the limbs with those rounded and graceful forms, of which the Venus de Medici is an inimitable model. The greater firmness, delicacy and transpa- rence of the skin, the purer lily and more vivid rose of the complexion, and the fineness of the hair are equally connected with this system, and peculiar to woman. Such are the more striking, though merely external characteristics of this im- portant system in woman ; and whenever there is a deviation from these, there is in that system a proportional absence of female beauty.

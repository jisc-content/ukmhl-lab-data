LAWS OF FEMALE BEAUTY. 37 The CEREBELLUM, then, performs the third of the intellectual functions, or that of vo- lition. A second series of nerves proceed from the cerebellum to the muscles, and permit locomotion to be induced by volition. {See Plate XIII.) Here, then, appears the beautiful con- nection of sensation and locomotion, and the circle which they form : the muscular fibre is contracted by volition; and the will exercises this power through the me- dium of the second set of nerves. Every muscular fibre receives from this set a ner- vous filament; and the obedience of the fibre to the will ceases when the commu- nication of that filament with the central part of the system is interrupted.

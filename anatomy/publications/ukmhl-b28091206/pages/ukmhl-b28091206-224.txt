KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE 170 peritonaeum or membrane lining the cavity of the belly. These bodies are almost half the size of the male testicles, and are of a flattened oval figure. Like them, also, they are possessed of two arteries and one vein. The blood furnished by these comes from the aorta, and returns into the circu- lation, by the vena cava. The FALLOPIAN TUBES are placed some- what transversely within the same cavity, and hang loosely at the outer end, where they have an irregular termination, called morsus diaboli. At the other end each enters the uterus, and about the middle of each tube, at its lower edge, is attached one of the ovaria. The canal of these tubes is irregular, being, at its entrance into the uterus, so very small, that it is scarcely capable of admitting a hogâ€™s bristle, but, toward the ovaria, they become wider.

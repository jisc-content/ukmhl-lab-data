304 KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE friend of ours, that he would rather become the husband of such a woman at fifty, than of half the young women of twenty-five! When, indeed, we consider how charm- ing that momentary expression of features is, which silently unfolds the tale of form- er loves, which nicely appreciates all the ardour of the present lover, and which enhances love by well knowing all its causes, means, and modifications, we are not surprised, that enjoyment (when not modelled upon that prudence which pro- scribes, in the object of its love, all pleasures which are not its own) should sometimes in- duce the maid to choose a rake, and should always make a young and lovely widow more disposable than a virgin. Indeed, that seduction which the better sort of courtezanism may possess, is greatly founded upon this very quality.

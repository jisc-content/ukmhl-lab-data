KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE 76 sion another Pygmalion, who, in the dark, endeavoured to animate a cold and insensible representation of a most fasci- nating woman, and there left traces of a mad profanation.* The most advantage- ous offers could not prevail on the Gni- dians to part with this master-piece; and Pliny, who relates the fact, praises them for a noble refusal, the object of which immortalized their city, as well as their passion for the fine arts. The various views we have gfiven of this o immortal statue sufficiently illustrate it. * Ferunt amore captum quemdam, cum delituisset noctu, simulachro cohaesisse, ejusque cupiditatis esse indicem maculam.â€”Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. x.x.wi. cap. v.

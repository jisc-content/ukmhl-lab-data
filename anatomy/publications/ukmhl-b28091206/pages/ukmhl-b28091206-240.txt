186 KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE roxysm, in the female, terminates by an emission of semen. The impossibility of such an occurrence is evident, when we re- collect that a female has no seminal vessels. That a certain sensation is produced, in the female, which terminates the paroxysm, is certain, as well as that there is a con- siderable discharge of lubricating fluid, but that can alone proceed from the secret- ing mucous glands. Of the principal uses of the hair on the mons veneris, that of increasing the sexual pleasure by contrast between this and the interior part is probably not the least. We have thus explained the form and structure and the separate functions or uses of the male and female organs of generation, as preparatory to the right understanding of their united functions in the sexual embrace.

KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE 212 Hence we see that the function of gene- ration is the same in its most complex as in its simplest state—it is still gemmipar- ous generation or generation by shoots. The vascularity must, on the same prin- ciple, become universal; but the adhesion must be confined to a given part of the ovulum and the uterus ; because, although the male albumen aggregates with that of the female from similarity of nature, yet. therefore, the arterial fibres have neither the structure nor the chemical composition of muscles, they cannot either be muscular, or fulfil the office of muscles, which, indeed, is sufficiently apparent from their elasticity. This elasticity, however, supplies the place of muscu- lar power; and Haller’s description of the pulse is cor- rect, notwithstanding his idea of the cause of the con- traction of the arteries is confuted. On the other hand, Bichat’s opinion, that the arteries are not dilated, but only vibrate about their situation, on account of their numerous flexures, w'hen the heart forces the blood into them, must be incorrect, being contrary to the mathe- matical laws of hydrostatics.

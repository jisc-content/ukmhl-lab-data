Both series ot ves- sels, commencing by innumerable minute orifices, combine to form larger branches, and conduct their respective liquidsâ€”the lymph and chyle, into the circulating sys- tem. The membranes of which the lym- phatic vessels are composed, are thin and delicate, without the appearance of fibres, and internally, have valves opening in the direction in which their liquid flows, which is toward the heart.

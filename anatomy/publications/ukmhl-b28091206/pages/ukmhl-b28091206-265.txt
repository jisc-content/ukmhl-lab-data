LAWS OF FEMALE BEAUTY. 2 11 albuminous drop, the union of its carbon with the surrounding albumen, will form a mus- cular ring; successive rings will of course be formed as the carbonated blood passes onward; and these rings will evidently diminish in diameter, as the globules ot blood diminish by the expenditure of their carbon. Thus, muscular canals will be formed,* and vessels will shoot throughout the mass. ° We should here, perhaps say, fibrous, not muscu- lar, canals. It is immaterial which. “ My e.xperi- ments,” says an excellent observer,” have proved, that these fibres cannot possibly be muscular, since muscu- lar fibres are soft and flaccid, containing more than J of their weight of humidity, while those of the arteries are dry, and quite elastic, and since the muscles agree in their chemical properties with the fibrine of the blood, being soluble in acetic acid, and entering into combi- nations of difficult solubility with muriatic and nitric acids, while the arterial fibres, on the contrary, are insoluble in vinegar, but are dissolved pretty easily in the diluted mineral acids, and not separated from them either by simple or prussiated alkalis, which are the precipitants of fibrine, [as well as of albumen.] Since P 2

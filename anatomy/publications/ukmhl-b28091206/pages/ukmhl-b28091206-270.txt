2I6 KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE posed of musclesâ€”thus the principal parts of these two systems are brought under the influence of the nervous system, and of sensibility ; and this being the case, it is easy to conceive how the subordinate parts of these systems must be regulated. Hence also, and perhaps in some mea- sure from the predominance of the more active or more passive male or female liquid, the sex may arise ; for it certainly is highly probable that, in all cases, the one is more active, the other more passive. The sex may, in this way, be connected with the power of sensibility and imagination, which will naturally be more or less influ- enced by the concentration and quality of the secreted liquid. But of this, here- after. As, moreover, sex may be de- pendent on the quality, so may resemblance be dependent on the quantity of this fluid.

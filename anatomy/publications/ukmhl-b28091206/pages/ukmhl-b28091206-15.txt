NOTE The title of this work, as compounded of «aXos beautiful, ywrf woman, and vo/ios law, should, regu- larly, be Kalogynonomia; but the duplication of no is avoided in conformity with a similar practice of nomenclaturists—in the terms, for instance, of natu- ral history, &c.,—as giving an awkward length to the English word. The more compressed term, Kalogynomia, is therefore preferred, as equally ex- pressive and more manageable in the formation of the related terms.

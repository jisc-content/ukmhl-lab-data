38 KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE A circle of functions, we may observe, thus exists in animals, because volition, the last of the intellectual functions, con- nects itself to the mechanical ones, by ren- dering them subservient to it in locomotion. Thus, the first and the last of these func- tions are as intimately connected as any of the intermediate ones, and a beautiful cir- cle of organic function and organic influ- ence is formed. We have thus a slight sketch of the class of organs which are termed intellectual, of the three orders of which it consists, and of the functions which they perform.

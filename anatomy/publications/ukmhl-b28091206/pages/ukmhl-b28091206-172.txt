ii8 KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE SECTION II. Of the Periods and Symptoms of Love. It is justly observed, that man presents a peculiarity in not being subject to the in- fluence of the seasons in the exercise of his genital functions. Animals, on the con- trary, cohabit at fixed periods and certain times of the year, and afterwards seem to forget the pleasures of love to satisfy other wants. Thus wolves and foxes couple in the winter, deer in the autumn, the gene- rality of birds in the spring, &c. Man alone has sexual intercourse at all times, and impregnates the female under every latitude and in all climates.

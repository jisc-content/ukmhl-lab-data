It must, however, be observed, that if the periods of association for sexual infide- lity be of long continuance, and occur be- tween parties who are mutually capable of procreation, and who mutually abandon themselves to that pleasure, without which no procreation can exist, then, irregular progeny inay be called into life, and the crime of producing it, such as both the par- ties and moralists may deem it, may be consummated. Thus, in the worst cases, both jealousy and persecution on the one hand, and ir- regular progeny on the other, may be the consequences of sexual infidelity.

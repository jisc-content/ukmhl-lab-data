32 KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE sists of filaments which approach each other as they pass inward and unite in bundles, termed nerves, of which the filaments are separated and the whole enveloped by a membrane called neurilema. These nerves contain a greater number of parallel fila- ments, in proportion as they are traced nearer to the spinal marrow and the brain, whither they convey impressions from ex- ternal objects, and where they give origin to various operations. These filaments, from the centres at which they thus arrive, are again also, under the name of nerves, distributed over most parts of the body, whither they convey the influence of volition. Thus, all these distant ramifications are united at one of their extremities, that is in the head and spine; these central parts constitute a communication between the organs of sense and the muscles; and hence they are denominated the sensorium com-

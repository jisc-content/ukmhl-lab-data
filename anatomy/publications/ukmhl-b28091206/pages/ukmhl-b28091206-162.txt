KALOGYNOMIA, OR THE io8 in the lumbar regions, &c. The first ap- pearance of the menses terminates this state, which in numerous instances may be considered a real disease ; a pure and crimson blood flows in greater or less abundance for several days ; and the fe- male is relieved from those oj)pressive symptoms. This evacuation, at first irregular, after- wards becomes periodical every month, lasting from two to eight days, and evacu- ating from three ounces to a pound of blood at each time. In women of a san- guineous temperament, of full habit and libidinous propensity, or in weak women, the menses remain longest and flow in the greatest quantity. The blood effused is red, arterial, and, in a healthy person, does not possess any of those ill qualities which have been attributed to it.

THE CEREBELLUM is supplied by branches from three Vessels, viz., | ^^^^ Basil^r^a/^eWor/*/''*''^' Each Vertebral supplies the Cerebelkim by owe Branch, ,, ,, Posterior Inferior Cerebellar. The Basilar ,, /o«j'Branches ,, ,, Anterior, Inferior and the Superior Cerebellar on each side. Hence there are two Branches for the upper surface of the Cerebellum, and four for its lower surface. Of these Arteries, one, the Anterior Inferior Cerebellar, is unimportant. ( The Superior Cerebellar winds round the Crus Cerebri behind the 3rd Nerve, parallel to the 4th, to Superior Surface of Cerebellum.

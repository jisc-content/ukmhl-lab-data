The Branches must be distinguished from those of the Eadial and Carpal on the back of the Hand. The Tarsal Branch is not represented in the case of the Hand. ,, Metatarsal resembles the Posterior Carpal Arch, but gives off three Dorsal Interosseous Branches instead of two. ,, 3rd and 4th Dorsal Interosseous resemble ,, the two Dorsal Interosseous Branches of the Posterior Carpal Arch. ,, 2nd ,, ,, resembles ,, Metacai-pal Branch of the Badial Artery. ,, 1st Dorsal Interosseous resembles ,, Dorsalis Pollicis together with the Dorsalis Indicis. ,, Plantar Branch, supplies the inner side of the Great Toe; the 2nd Plantar supplies the contiguous sides of the Great and 2nd Toes ;—as distinguished from the Eadial, which gives off the Princeps Pollicis to both sides of the Thumb, and the Radialis Indicis to the radial side of Second Finger.

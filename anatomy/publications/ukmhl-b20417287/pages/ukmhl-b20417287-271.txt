CUTANEOUS NERVES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. On the Scalp Branches of the Facial Nerve alternate with Branches of the 1st, 2n<l and 3rd Divs. of the 5th Xerve successively. On the Face ,, „ ,, ,, ,, and decussate with Branches of the same. In the Diagram the Branches of the Facial Xerve are represented by dotted lines, and those of other Nerves by continuous lines. ON THE SCALP there are from before backwardu the following Nerves :— Supraorbital (1) from the Fird JDiohion of the 5th Nerve. Malar Branches {a) of Facial Nerve. Temporo-malar (Temporal Branch) (,.') from the Second Division of the 5th Nerve. Temporal Branches (b) of Facial Nerve. Auriculo-temporal (3) from the Third Division of the 5th Nerve. Posterior Auricular (Auricular Branch) (o) of Facial Nerve. Small Occipital (c') from Anterior Branch of 2nd Cervical Nerve. Posterior Auricular (Occiisital Branch) {d) of Facial Nerve. Great Occipital (c") from Posterior Branch of 2nd Cervical Nerve. ON THE FACE there are from above downwards the following Nerves :— Malar {a) of the Facial and Supraorbital Branches, etc. (I) of the First Division of the Fifth. Infraorbital (e) ,, „ ,, Infraorbital Bi-anch (II) „ Second „ ,, „ Supramaxillary (/) ) \ Labial (III) and ) i m ■ i with Buccal Branch (3) 1 " " " | Buccal {./) ^ branches „ Ihrd „ „ „ . BELOW THE INFERIOR MAXILLA there are from cd}ove downwards the following Nerves : — Inframaxillary of the Facial (h) with the first of the following Nerves, viz., the Superficial Cervical (c'"). The former ramifies chiefly under the Platysma, the latter over it.

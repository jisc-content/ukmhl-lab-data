85 MUSCLES OP ABDOMEN. Six Muscles on each side enter into the formation of the Wall of the Abdomen :— Three broad, transverse Muscles,—External Oblique, Internal Oblique, and Transversalis,—laterally. Two narrow, vertical ,, —Rectus and Fyramidalis, —in front. One „ ,, Muscle, —Quadratus Lumborum, •—behind. The fibres of the Ext. Oblique run down and in, parallel to those of the Ext. Intercostal, hence its orhjin is said to be above. „ ,, ,, hit. „ ,, up „ ,, „ „ „ „ Int. ,, ,, ,, „ below. ,, ,, ,, Transversalis „ transversely in, ,, ,, behind. The following Table gives the attachments of these Muscles :— Common Points of Attachment. External Oblique. Internal Oblique. Transversalis. Ribs, Lower eight (ext. surfaces) inter- digitating I SerratusMagnum. with 1 Latiss. Dorsi. Lower four (edges of Cartilages) continuous with lowest two In- ternal Intercostals. Lower si.c (under surfaces of Cartilages) interdigitating with Diaphragm. Crest of Ilium. Anterior ^- of outer Lip. Anterior § of space between Lips. Anterior | of inner Lip. Poupart's Ligament. Whole length. Outer half. Outer third. Spine of Pubes and Ilio-pectineal Line. 1 Spine only. J inch of Ilio-pectineal Line. 1 inch of Ilio-pectineal Line. Front of Symphysis Pubes. Linea Alba, 1 Both. Both. Both. Special Points of Attachment. Pectoralis Major above. Fascia Lumborum behind. Fascia Lumborum behind. On reference to the Diagram it will be seen, as regards the attachments of the Muscles to the Iliac Crest, to Poupart's Ligament and to the Ilio-pectineal Line, that in each case the Transversalis is attached most externally, the External Oblique most internally, and the Internal Oblique intertnediatcly. Anteriorly each Muscle becomes aponeurotic, and the Aponeuroses, crossing in front and behind the Eectus, join those of the opposite side to form the Linea Alba. 12

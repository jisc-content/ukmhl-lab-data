176 NERVES OP THE SUBMAXILLARY REGION. appear ia the Neck between 1 the Hypoglossal crosses over ( Glosso-pliar. „ ,, In connection with the Submaxillary Region there are four chief Nerves, viz. :—the Inferior Dental, Gustatory, Hypoglossal and Glosso-pliaryngeal. These four Nerves lie in similar curves and give off Branches in a similar manner. The first two Nerves have analogous REliATIONS, as have also the last two, thus :— Tlie Inferior Dental and Gustatory are Brandies of the Inferior Maxillary Nerve and descend side by side, fi,.,f k<.fT„oo„ \ tli*^ Ext. Pterygoid Muscle and ) , i . \ the Internal Lateral Ligament and lymg fir.t between | | and then between j Ramus of the Jaw. The Inferior Dental then enters its Canal in the Jaw to supply the Teeth and Skin, etc., of Lower Lip. ,, Gustatori/ „ runs on the Muo. Memb. louZer ,, „ ,, ,, Tongue,, Mucous Membrane of Mouth.

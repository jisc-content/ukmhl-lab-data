( Immediately above Inner Head of Triceps. ( Immediately above Outer Head of Triceps. In addition to these six Muscles, the long Heads of the Biceps and Triceps assist in raising and depressing the Humerus. ^Lon'^Head | ^^oi'tl'li^s and tendinous—lying above Head of Humerus within Capsular Ligament, giving fibres to the Glenoid Ligament. ''^^ong Head I ^^'^ ^^'"''"^"^'^^''''''^ —" below ,, ,, outside ,, ,, ,, ,, Capsular ,, Of these Muscles, the/rs( ^)«ir—Pectoralls Major and Latissimus Dorsi—pass from the front and back of the Chest respectifely in the anterior and posterior folds of the Axilla, and after twisting more or less on themselves, are inserted side by side into the Bicipital Groove. The second jjair—Coraco-braehialis and Deltoid—arise, the former from the Coracoid Process, the latter by its chief part from (he Aci'oniion Process, and passing, one to the outer and the other to the iuner side of the Shoulder-Joint, are inserted half way down the corresponding side of the Humerus. The third pair—Teres Major and Teres Minor—arise from equal lengths of the outer border of the Scapula, and are inserted, the former below the small Tuberosity above the Inner Head of the Triceps, the latter below the large Tuberosity above the Outer Head of the Triceps. —The movements of the Humerus at the Shoulder-joint are supplemented by movements of the Scapula, produced by a second group of th7-ee pairs of Muscles connected with the Scapula and Clavicle. As regards their attachments they may be grouped as follows :— ^""^ t (b) Trrpeziur'*°'*^ connect the Shoulder-girdle with the Head. ( (c) Levator Anguli Scapulas two < (d) Rhomboideus Major ,, „ ,, ,, ,, Spine. two with Rhomb. Minor (e) Serratus Magnus TfV.o (f) Subclavius " » " " " And as regards their action, as follows :— tico (a and b) raise the Shoulder-girdle and one (f) depresses it, two (c and e) draw the Scapula forwards and rotate it, and one (d) draws it backwards and rotates it. The Scapula in its movements is not only drawn dh-ectly forwards, backwards or upwards, but is also rotated round a point situated a short distance behind the Glenoid Fossa.

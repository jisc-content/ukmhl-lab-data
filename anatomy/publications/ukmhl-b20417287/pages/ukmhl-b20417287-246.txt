GENERAL VIEW OF THE ARTERIES OF THE TRUNK-WALLS. Running longitudinally downwards in the niid-Unc of the Trunk in front of the Spine is the Aorta. rrom the lower end of the Aorta come off on each side the main trunks for the Pelvis and Lower Limbs. ,, upj^er part. „ ,, ,, ,, ,, „ „ Head and Neck and Upper Limbs. The former (the Internal and External Iliacs) arise from the Aorta by a common trunk, the Common Iliac, as do also the latter (the Carotid and Subclavian) on the right side by the Innominate Artery. The Left Carotid and Left Subclavian are unsymmetrical, arising directly and separately from the Aorta. Springing from Artery for Upper Limb (Subclavian) is a Branch (Int. Mammary) which turns longitudinaUy down near mid-line in front. „ ,, ,, Lower ,, (Ext. Iliac) ,, ,, (Epigastric) ,, ,, „ upwards,, „ „ Within the Rectus Muscle the Internal Mammary and Epigastric join. There are thus three longitudinal Vessels in the wall of the Ti'uuk, one in the mid-lme behind, and two, one on each side of the mid-line in front. Connecting the Aorta behind with these Vessels in front are on each side a series of arterial arches, one opposite each Dorsal Vertebra except fhejirgf, and each Lumbar Vertebra except the last. These arches are formed by the Intercostal and Lumbar Arteries poateriorlij and outgoing Branches of the Internal Mammary and Epigastric Arteries anteriorly in the Dorsal and Lumbar Regions respectively. The place of the Intercostal Arch opposite the 1st Dorsal Vertebra (1st Intercostal Space) is taken by the Superior Inter- costal, a branch from the Subclavian, the outer of the two main trunks for the Head and Upper Limb. The place of the Lumbar Arch opposite the last Lumbar Vertebra is taken by the Ilio-lumbar, a branch from the Internal Iliac, the inner of the two main trunks for the Pelvis and Lower Limb. Springing from these Arches posteriorly, anteriorly, and laterally are perforating branches which supply the Integuments, etc,

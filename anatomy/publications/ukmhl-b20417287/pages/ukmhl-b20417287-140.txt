82 Muscles of the Ba,ck—continued. The SECOIfD GROUP (Extensors of the Back) consists of three jmbs of Muscles, which pass vertically upwards, the whole series forming a somewhat cylindrical column occupying the groove between the Spines and Laniiuas. The Muscles of the first pair connect the Pelvis with the Dorsal Vertebras and Ribs. „ ,, second „ ,, „ Dorsal Vertebrse and Ribs with the Cervical Vertebrae. „ „ „ third „ ,, „ Cervical „ with the Head. The two Muscles of each pair lie side by side, one externally, the other internally, and the pairs succeed each other in a zigzag fashion (see Diagram). The lowest pair spring opposite the last Rib from the Erector Spin£e by subdivision of its fibres.

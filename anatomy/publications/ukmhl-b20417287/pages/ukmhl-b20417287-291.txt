CERVICAL PLEXUS. 177 The Cervical Plexus is formed by the union in loops of the Anterior Divisions of the first three Cervical Nerves and part of the fourth in front of the corresponding Transverse Processes of the Vertebrre. The 5B/ANCHES come ofF both from the Nerves themselves and from the Loops between them, and may be divided into Cutaneous, Muscular and Communicating Nerves. The Cutaneous Branches arise one from each Loop and one from each Nerve, except in the case of the fiist and last Nerves. Muscular Communicating' onlv. 1st Cervical Nerve Loop between 1st and 2nd Nerves 2nd Cervical Nerve Loop between 2nd and 3rd Nerves 3rd Cervical Nerve Loop between 3rd and 4th Nerves 4th Cervical Nerve Muscular.

146 ARTERIES OF REGIONS, ETC. ARTEEIES OF SCALP [Four). One, Ophthalmic, sends branches backwards from the front, One, Occipital „ „ forwards ,, behind. Tico, Temporal and Posterior Auricular, are placed laterally, one in front and one behind Pinna of Ear (see Diagram). N.B.—The Frontal Artery accompanies the Suprati"Ochlear Nerve.—The Frontal Nerve is accompanied by the Supraorbital Artery. MENINGEAL ARTERIES. In each of the three Fossfc of the Skull there are two small Meningeal Arteries on each side which supply the Dura-mater, etc., of the contiguous part of the Base of the Skull. In the Middle Fossa is also on each side a single large Artery, which supplies the Dura-mater, etc., of the Vault of the Skull. ( In the Anterior Fossa are twigs from the Ant. and Post. Ethmoidal Arteries, entering through the Ant. and Post. Ethmoidal Canals. < „ ,, Middle ,, ,, the Small Meningeal & Meningeal of Ascend. Pharyngeal ,, ,, ,, For. Ovale, and For. Lacerum Med.

It thus gives a branch to the ouUr wall of the Tympanum just before entering the Skull, and a branch to the inner wall just after entering it. ARTERIES OF NOSE. Three distinct Arteries supply the Nose ; one (Internal Maxillary), from leJdnd, one (Ophthalmic) from above, and one (Facial) from the front ; each Artery giving two Branches.

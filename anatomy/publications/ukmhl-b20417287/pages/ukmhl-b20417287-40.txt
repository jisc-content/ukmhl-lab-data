22 RIBS. ( a Posterior Extremity, comprising a Head, Neck and Tuberosity. A Hib consists of < an Anterior „ ( a Shaft, and presents two Surfaces, two Borders and five Curves. f A short curve corresponding to the Posterior Extremity. I A long ,, „ „ Shaft. Curves -| An upward ,, „ „ Posterior Extremity. I A downward ,, „ ,, Anterior ,, LA twist of the Bone upon its own axis, the outer surface looking upwards in front, and downwards behind. The junction of the short and long curves is indicated on the outer surface by a ridge,—the Posterior Amjle. The same point marks the beginning of the upward Curve, and is the point round which the bone is twisted. The junction of the downward curve with the shaft is indicated by the Anterior Angle. The first Pdb has only one curve, its Posterior Angle coinciding with its Tubercle. The last „ „ „ „ falling upon its Anterior Extremity. The Curves and Angles are all most marked in the seventh Rib, thence upwards and downwards becoming less distinct. The distance between the Posterior Angle and the Tubercle increases from above downwards. The Posterior Extremities (Heads and Necks) increase in size from above down, being small and rounded in the upper, large and flattened in the lower Ribs. The Anterior Extremities and Tubercles diminish in size from above down, being largest in the first Rib. The Tubercle consists of an articular and a non-articular portion, the articular portion in the upper Ribs is oval with the long diameter transverse, and is convex, „ ,, „ lower ,, ,, „ „ vertical „ flat. In the eleventh and twelfth Ribs the Tubercle is wanting. The Intercostal Groove narrows from above down, being indistinguishable from its breadth in the first Rib, and being obliterated in the last Rib. This table refers only to the general oharacteristics of the Ribs.

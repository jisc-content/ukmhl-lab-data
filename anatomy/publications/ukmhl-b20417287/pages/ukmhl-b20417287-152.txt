90 Muscles of Ferinevtm—conimied. IN FEMALE, —the Muscles are arranged as in the Male, except in the points indicated below :— Levator Ani invests the Vagina as in the Male it invests the Prostate. Erector Clitoridis is smaller than the Erector Penis. ( heldnd is connected vrith the Central Point of the Perinaeum, Sphincter Vaginae {representing the Bulbo-cavernosus) < in front is reflected round the Corpora Cavernosa of the Clitoris, ( iniermediate/y surrounds orifice of Vagina and invests Bulb of Vestibule. MUSCLES OP THE UPPER EXTREMITY. MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER. Three pair^ of Muscles (A) are specially concerned in the movements of the Shoulder-joint, and these are supplemented by three other pairs (B) which act upon the Shoulder-girdle (the Scapula and Clavicle). Lastly there is a third group of three single Muscles (C) whose chief function it is to retain the Head of the Humerus firmly against the Glenoid Fossa. The Muscles of each pair present many analogies in origin, course of fibres, insertion and action. The attachments, etc., as given on succeedhig pages should he cempared line hy line. A.—The muscles acting specially on the Shoulder-joint move the Humerus in six chief directions (see Diagram) thus :— j Pectoralis Major moves the Humerus doionwards, forwards and «/nt)a?-fZs across front of Thorax. ( Latissimus Dorsi „ ,, ,, ,, backwards „ „ „ back „ ,, ( Coraco-brachialis „ ,, ,, upwards, forwards „ „ towards the Pace. ) Deltoid (post, fibres)* „ ,, ,, ,, backwards „ „ „ ,, Occiput. ( Teres Major rotates „ ,, inwards round its longitudinal axis. ( Teres Minor „ ,, ,, outivards ,, ,, ,, ,, " The other portions of the Deltoid draw the Humerus directly upwards.

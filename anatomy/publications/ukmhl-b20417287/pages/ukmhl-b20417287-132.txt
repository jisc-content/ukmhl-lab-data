76 HYOID MUSCLES. These are divisible iuto three Groups, eacli consisting of three Muscles. THREE VEKTICAL DEPRESSORS. Sterno-hvoid \ "'■'!/'" —Posterior Surfaces of Manubrium, Cartilage of 1st Rib and Clavicle (inner end). \ insertion —Hyoid Bone—lower edge of Body. Thvro-Hvoid \ —Thyroid Cartilage (Oblique Line), some fibres being continued from Sterno-thyroid. with ' insertion —Hyoid Bone—loiver edge of Great Cornu. Sterno-thyroid \ —Posterior Surfaces of Manubrium and Cartilage of 1st Eib, below and behind Sterno-hyoid. j insertion —Thyroid Cartilage (Oblique Line), some fibres being continued into Thyro-hyoid. Omo-hvoid \ —Transverse Ligament of Scapula and contiguous part of Superior Border of Scapula. ' I insertion —Hyoid Bone—lower edge of Body at jnnclion icith Great Cornu.

As regards^ the attachment of the Muscles to the Hyoid Bone :— The Vertical Elevators are all fixed one above another to the Body of the Bone, The Depressors arc attached side by side—one to the Body, one near the junction of the Body and Great Coniu, and one to the Great Cornu, The Oblique Muscles are attached, two near the junction of the Body and Great Cornu, and one to the Great Cornu.

I ( fibrous band between points of origin from bone. I,The Recti are inserted into the Sclerotic at equidistant points, | in. from the Cornea. ( Superior Oblique,—arising from Roof of Orbit above and internal to Common Tendon, inserted into upper, back and outer part of Sclerotic. I Inferior ,, — „ ,, Floor,, ,, at inner side, ant. to Lachrymal Groove ,, close to Superior Oblique. The Oblique Muscles cross helow the corresponding Recti. ,, Superior Oblique passes between the Superior Rectus and the Eyeball. ,, Inferior ,, ,, ,, ,, Inferior „ „ „ Floor of the Orbit, (,, also „ ,, External „ „ „ Eyeball). Levator Palpebrse Superioris,—arising from Roof of Orbit in front of Optic Foramen, inserted into anterior surface of Tarsal Cartilage ( The External and Internal Recti turn the Eyeball in corresponding directions. Actions ^ " 'S^P^""' " Inferior ,, ,, „ ,, „ ,, ,, and also inwards. ) ,, ,, Oblique turns,, ,, down and out, acting with Inferior Rectus. ( ,, Inferior ,, ,, „ ,, u^s ,, ,, ,, Superior ,, EYELIDS, In the Upper Lid there are seven layers from before back as follows :— 1. Skin. •2. Orbicularis Palpebrarum (Palpebral portion) Muscle. 3. Tarsal Ligament. 4. Levator Palpebrce Superioris Tendon. 5. Tarsal Cartilage. 6. Layer of Meibomian Glands. 7. Conjunctiva [Mucous Membrane). Each of these hiyel's is different in nature froiii the others, Tho Tendon formifg the Central Layer is absent in the Lower Lid, otherwise the hiyere in that Lid are tho same as in the Upper Lid.

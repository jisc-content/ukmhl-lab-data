VERTEBRA. 5 BODIES. Structure Size Form. Upper. Lower. Lateral. Anterior and Posterior. Special Points. PEDICLES. Like that of short bones,—Cancelli increase in size from above downwards. Increases from above down. ( Cervical,—quadrilateral, broadened transversely, as line of centre of gravity falls within them. < Liimhar,— oval, ,, transversely, ,, ,, „ within ,, {Dorsal, —heart-shaped, ,, antero-posteriorly, ,, „ „ in front of them. ( Cervical,—bevelled in front, lipped at sides and behind, to limit movement. < Lumbar,—slightly concave opposite centre of Intervertebral Disc, to allow free movement. ( Dorsal, —flattened, movement being very limited. I Cervical,—obverse of upper. < Lumbar,—similar to ,, (Dorml, — ,, ,, ,, ( Cervical,—flat. < Tjumbar,—much constricted. ( Dorml, —slightly ,, f Cervical,-—of equal depth, curve being formed by Intervertebral Discs. \ Lumbar,—anterior deejier than posterior, ,, ,, Bodies and Intervertebral Discs. \ Dor/^al, —posterior deeper than anterior, ,, ,, Bodies chiefly, j In the cervical the anterior surfaces are at a lower level than the posterior. I In the dorsal and lumbar they are at the same level. I Cervical,-—side of Body bears anterior root of Transverse Process. ) Lumbar,— ,, „ continued into margin of ,, ,, 'i Dorsal, — ,, ,, bears facet for Rib. ' In all there are foramina for vessels on lateral and posterior surfaces. ( Increase in size from above downwards. 1 Cervical,—run backwards and outwards, placed between roots of Transverse TProcesses. \ Lumbar,— ,, „ directly, and carry Transverse Processes. [Dorsal, — „ lowest three bear facets for Eibs.

MUSCLES OP THE BACK. 81 The Muscles of the Back form four Groups—three consisting each of three pairs of muscles or sets of muscles, and one of three double muscles. In addition there are the four single muscles of the Suboccipital Triangle, viz. | Obliquf'^*^*^' The muscles of each Group are more or less related to each other in position and fiinction. ,, „ ,, pair „ „ „ „ ,, ,, ,, and attachments. The FIHST GROUP—Muscles of Upper Extreniityand Thorax—consists of threepwrs of muscles, which pass more or less transversely outwards. { The muscles of the first pair connect one the Head and Spine the other the Pelvis and Spine with the Upper Extremity. ■| „ ,, „ second ,, „ the Spine with the Scapula (posterior border).

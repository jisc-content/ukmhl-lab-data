The arrangement is the same as on the right side, except that the Inferior Cardiac of the Vagus does not join the Middle Cardiac of the Sympathetic, but enters the Superficial Cardiac Plexus separately, as does also the Superior Cardiac of the Sympathetic, and that the Middle Cardiac of the Sympathetic joins with the Inferior of the same to enter the Deep Cardiac Plexus. The lowest Cardiac Branches of the Vagus are absent. * The Plexus on the Vertebral Artery is not to be taken as if analogous to the Thyroid and Pliaryngeal Plexuses, although it is represented in a similar form in the Diagram, Middle Inferior rjives ■ receives 3 Brandies gives ^ receives 2 Branches I r/ives

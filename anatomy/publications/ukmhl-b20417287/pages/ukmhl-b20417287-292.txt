BRACHIAL PLEXUS. 178 FORMED by the union of 6 Nerves at the lower part of the Neck, 'jii'inrj off 6 Branches above the Clavicle and 6 below, and ending in 6 terminal Branches. Formation as frequently described .-— The 5th Nerve joined by the 6th near the Vertebrse and by the 7th near the 1st Rib forms an outer ,, 8th ,, „ part of the 1st Dorsal, near the Vertebrae „ ,, inner A Branch from the outer Cord joins a Branch from the inner to form a j>osterior Formation as sometimes descrihed and usually found:—• Each Nerve near its origin divides into an Anterior and a Posterior Division. The Anterior Divisions of the 5th, 6th and 7th Nerves unite to form an outer ,, Posterior „ ,, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th ,, „ ,, a posterior ,, Anterior ,, ,, 8th Cerv. and 1st Dors. ,, ,, „ an inner Cord (r).

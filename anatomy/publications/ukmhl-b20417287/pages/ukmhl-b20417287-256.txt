6 VEINS OF LOWER LIMB. For Relations of Femoral and Popliteal Veins see ' Femoral' and ' Popliteal Arteries,' pp. 125 and 127. The main vein crosses the Artery twice, lying first to its inner side, then behind it, then to its outer side, then (in Popliteal Space) crossing behind again, and lastly (at termination of Popliteal), lying at its inner side once more. The Saphena Veins in their course correspond with the Saphenous Nerves (which see); they commence in a transverse arch on the Dorsum of the Foot. THORACIC DUCT.

Ligaments of K-nee-Joint—continued. 63 Bursa Patellae, superficial, over lower half of Patella and upper half of Ligamentum Patellte. Infrapatellar Bursa, deep, between Ligamentum Patellae and upper part of Tubercle of Tibia, separated from Joint by Infrapatellar Pad of Fat. BURSiE (6 or 7) -; Bursa over Internal Lateral Lig., between it and the Tendons of Sartorius, Semitendinosus and Gracilis. ,, under External „ „ „ » Tendon of the Popliteus, communicating with .Joint. I A Bursa anteriorly, under Tendon of Quadriceps, frequently communicating with Joint.* [TvroBvLVSse posteriori)/ „ Heads of Gastrocnemius, generally ,, ,, ,, ■ This Bursa often blends witli the Pouch of Synovial Jlembrane prolonged ui^wards from the Joint. The number of Bursse corresponds to the number of Synovial Pouches. In each of the pairs of structures connected with the Knee-joint the inner structure is the larger, except in the case of the pair most superficial (the lateral parts of the Capsule or the Pietinacula) and the pair most deep (the articular surfaces of the Condyles of the Femur). LIGAMENTS OF TIBIA AND FIBULA. UPPER ARTICULATION. Anterior and Posterior, —broad bands between corresponding surfaces of upper ends of Tibia and Fibula. A single Synovial Membrane lines the Joint, ■which is often continuous with that of Knee-Joint. MIDDLE ARTICULATION. ( between Interosseous Borders of Tibia and Fibula. ) -n t i- Interosseous Membrane ] Fibres pass claim and out from Tibia, the bone most supported below. / Memtoane of Forcaniil)"^ ( Perforated above for Anterior Tibial Artery, hdow for Anterior Peroneal Artery ) INFERIOR ARTICULATION, Anterior and Posterior, —between corresponding surfaces of lower ends of Tibia and Fibula. Inferior, —transverse— „ pit on inner side of External Malleolus and lower margin of Tibia posteriorly. Interosseous \ "• apposed rough surfaces of lower ends of Tibia and Fibula, ' \ continuous with Interosseous Membrane. 9-2

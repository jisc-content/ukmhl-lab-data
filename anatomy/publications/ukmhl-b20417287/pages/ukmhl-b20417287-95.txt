COSTO-STERNAL LIGAMENTS. 53 Anterior, —like Stellate, radiating over Sternum from front of Cartilage. Posterior, — ,, ,, ,, „ back „ „ Capsular, —very thin, surrounding the Joint. Synovial Cavities — The 1st Cartilage is continuous with the Sternum without intervening Cavity. „ 2nd ' articulates „ ,, ,, by a double Joint, with Interarticular Cartilage. „ Cartilages from the 3rd to the 7th articulate ,, „ ,, ,, .s/^j/Ze Joints, without „ ,, The 3rd Articulation is sometimes double. In old .ige the Synovial cavities disapj^ear. The Costo-xiphoid Ligament unites the 7th Costal Cartilage with the Xiphoid Cartilage anteriorly, INTEROHONDRAL AND STERNAL LIGAMENTS. The Cartilages of the last true Rib (the 7th) and of the Eibs on either side of it (the 6th and 8th) articulate with each other by small synovial joints midway between their extremities. The Ribs and Cartilages are directly continuous with each other. The Sternum „ Xiphoid Cartilage „ ,, ,, ,, ,, „ The 2nd piece of the Sternum is usually united with the 1st by a fixed Joint. 8

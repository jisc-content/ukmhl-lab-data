64 LIGAMENTS OF ANKLE-JOINT. Anterior, —membranous, between lower edge of Tibia and upper surface of neck of Astragalus. Posterior, ■—transverse, Y-shaped, from pit on inner side of External Malleolus to posterior margins of Tibia and Astragalus. Internal Lateral,—(Deltoid), from border of Internal Malleolus to Scaphoid, Os Calcis (Lesser Process) and Astragalus. Deeper fibres pass from the apex of the Malleohis to the hmer surface of the Astragahis. ( Anterior Fasciculus, slioiiest, from anterior margin of Ext. Malleolus to Astragalus in front of ext. Facet.

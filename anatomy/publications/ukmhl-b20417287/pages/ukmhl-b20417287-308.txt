188 Appendix— continued. INTERAKTICULAR FIBRO-CABTILAGES. There a.re Jive Joints on each side of the Body which contain more or less freely moveable Interartioular Fibro-Cartilages, viz. : — One in the Head, —the Temporo-maxillary Joint. ,, ,, ,, Upper Extremity, — ,, Inferior Radio-vilnar ,, (Wrist). ,, ,, Lower „ — ,, Knee-Joint. ., at each end of the Clavicle,— „ Sterno-clavicular and Acromio-clavicular Joints. NUTRIENT FOKAMINA. Wlien the Body is semi-recumbent and when all the Joints are semi-flexed, the Nutrient Foramen in each bone will be found to be directed more or less toward the ground. SUPBASCAPTJLAR ABTEBY AND NERVE (p. 134), ETC. In the case of these structures, as in most oases where an Artery and a Nerve take similar courses, the Artery takes the course which appears to render it less liable to compression than the Nerve, e.g., Naso-palatiae Nerve and accompanying Artery in the Anterior Palatine Foramen, Hj'poglossal Nerve and Lingual Artery in relation with Genio-hyo-glossus, etc. Nerves on the left side of the Body generally lie more anteriorly than those on the rifiht side, e.g., the Naso-palatine Nerves in the Ant. Palatine Foramen, the Phrenic Nerves and the Pneumogastric Nerves. Muscles ami Aponeuroses, on the other hand, are more developed on the right side than on the left, e.g , the Right Crus of Diaphragm, the Right Platysma and the Right External Oblique (which overlap the Left), etc. When two aftnocieded sfruefiires lie one above another, the lower is generally the larger, e.g., the two sets of Branches of the Lenticular Ganglion, the two Branches of the Superior Gluteal Nerve, the Pudic Nerve and the JMerve to the Obturator Internus on the Ischial Spine, etc.

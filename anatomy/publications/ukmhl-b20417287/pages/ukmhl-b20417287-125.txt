MUSCLES OP THE E^^^^-MAXILLARY REGION. 71 The Relations of the chief structures in and near the Region are as follows :— Internal to Ramus of Inferior Maxilla. Posterior to Rann^^s of Inferior Maxilla. ^ Internal Jfaxillary Artcrii and Branches. I External Pterygoid Muscle ( Parotid Gland Inferior Maxillary i\' rix and Branches.

122 Abclominal Aortd^—mitimicd. THIRD GROUP. Three sets of Vessels, as under : — Middle Sacral \ ^"^^^ ^i'"™ bifurcation of Aorta, (sini'le) ] passes vertically downwards along mid-line of Sacrum to Coccyx, ( gives twigs to Sacrum and Rectum, and joins the Lateral Sacral. Diaphragmatic i ^^'^^ separately or together from Abdominal Aorta at its commencement, or from Cteliac Axis, (two) ) P'^^® thence on Diaphragm, the Eight towards the Vena Cava, the Left towards the Oesophagus, ( each dividing behind the corresponding tube into two terminal branches. Tcrm'uial B/O/ic/ifsf include tlie corresponding Opening (for Vena Cava or (Esophagus) in the angle Ijetwccn them, of each '| ^^^^^ nass ' forwards to the Sternum to join Phrenic Branches of Internal Mammarj'. ( outwards ,, Hibs ,, ,, Musculo-plu-enic ,, ,, ,, and Intorcostals. Tlie Right Diaphragmatic supplies twigs to the Vena Cava, the Left to the (Esophagus. Each gives offsets to the corresponding Suprarenal Capsule. I arise, one pair opposite each of the upper 4 Lumbar Vertebras, Lumbar (4 pairs) I pass under Psoas Muscle between points of attachment to Vertebrfe, ( divide into Abdominal and Dorsal Branches. Abdominal Branch'-s i ^'"^^^ behind Quadratus and Transvorsalis, { anastomosing with the other Arteries of the Abdominal Parletos. Dorsal resemble closely the corresponding branches of the Intercostal Arteries. The Abdominal Branches arc separated from the Abdominal Cavity chiefly by 3 successive Muscles, viz., the Psoas, Quadratus and Transversalis. Course Relations COMMON ILIAC ARTERIES. from bifurcation of Aorta to Lumbo-sacral Joint, where each Vessel divides into Ext. and Int. Iliac Arts, of same side, indicated on the surface by a line drawn from left of Umbilicus towards middle of Poupart's Ligament. Both A-'essels lie between the Vertebral Ligaments and the Peritoneum. 1 Eight Common Iliac Vein crosses heldnd it below, and the Left behind it above. Right < ,, Ureter and Eight Eoot of Hypogastric Plexus cross in front of it. I ( The Common Iliac Veins unite to form the Vena Cava Inferior on the right of the Artery at its commencement. Left Left Common Iliac Vein lies on its right side. ,, Ureter, Left Eoot of Hypogastric Plexus and Supei'ior Ha?morrhoidal Artery cross in front o/it. There are thus four Structures in relation with each Vessel:— On the right side two cross in front and two behind. „ ,, left ,, three ,, „ one lies on the I'ight side (none being behind).

iv PREFACE. It is the disappointing experience of every Medical Student, in consequence of the enormous amount of material with which he is now obliged to overload his memory, that facts such as those Avith which Anatomy deals, being as they are isolated and independent, hung together by no uniting bond, and amenable ai^parently to no law, are speedily crowded out l^y fresh matter and forgotten, or, at the best, left before the mind as dim and blurred pictures, intermingled and confused. That there is often, however, some method of associating together such details—as, for example, by their analogies and dissimilarities, their points of agreement or antithesis—it is the object of the present volume to show. In it the design above indicated will be apparent, both in the Diagrams, where for a numljcr of ideas one idea is generally substituted, and also in the Text, where common or opposite characteristics of facts or groups of facts are used for the purpose of classification. In the present volume the Bones, Ligaments, Muscles, Vessels and Nerves only are treated of, since they Avcre more esj^ecially dealt with by the Author last Winter. The remainder of the series he hopes to complete later on. Of the many shortcomings of the book as it is he is deeply conscious, especially in regard to the Diagrams, which, in order to ensure accuracy and to keep the price of the book within reasonable limits, have been for the most part home-drawn. Whether any of the analogies or homologies hinted at (some of which certainly appear to be remarkable,) have a wider or deeper meaning, the Author cannot at present undertake to say; but l^clieving that much more may be done in the same direction, and trusting that what has been done may perhaps prove of some little service to others, he has ventured to bring the suljject forward, although it is by no means so fully worked out as he hopes it may in time become.

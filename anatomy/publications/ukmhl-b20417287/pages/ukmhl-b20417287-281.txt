In the Sjjhenoidal Fissure the 4th is highest, and the 6th lowest, whilst intermediately the upper and lower branches of the Ophthalmic Division of the 5th and the 3rd alternate. In the Orbit there are three single Nerves laterally one above another, and three double Nerves intermediately one above another. Note the relation of the Norvea to the Heads of the External Rectus and to the Optic Nerve.

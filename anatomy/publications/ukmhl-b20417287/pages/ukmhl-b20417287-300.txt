Lumbar Flexas—continued. 182 ANTEKIOE. CBUIIAL NERVE. The Branches of the Nerve are grouped in three Sets of four Branches each ; the First Set being muscular, comprising two Branches above Poupart's Ligament and two below, all short; the Second Set, forming the Svperficial Division of the Nerve, consisting of 3 cutaneous branches and one muscular, all long; the Tliird Set, forming the Deep Division of the Nerve, consisting of 4 muscular branches, two short and tico long.

The Obturator Nerve just before emerging from the Pelvis splits into two Divisions, Superficial and Deep. The Superficial Division passes out cdjoi'e the Obturator Externus, and lies orer the Adductor Brevis; the Deep Division emerges through the Obturator Externus and runs beneath the Adductor Brevis. The Branch.es are as follows : Superficial Division* to Superficial Adductors Hip-joint. Femoral Artery. 1 Mid-femoral I Plexus botw. ' Pectineus. I Gracilis. I Adductor Longus. „ Brevis. Int.

Passes out from Pelvis over Pubic bone and divides at once into 3 Branches :— 1. To Pectineus. 2. To Hip-joint. 3. To Superficial Division of Obturator Nerve. « Three of the Branches of each Division are similar to tliree of those of the other. The remaining Branch of tlie Superficial Division goes to the Skin and tha of the Deep Division to a Muscle. The corresponding Branches of each Division are put first in the above table.

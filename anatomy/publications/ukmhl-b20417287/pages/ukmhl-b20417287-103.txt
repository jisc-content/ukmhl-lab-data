CARPAL LIGAMENTS, Etc. 57 LIGAMENTS OF EACH ROW. Palmar Dorsal short bands passing between contiguous bones. _ , ( 2 in 1st Row, one on each side of the Semilunar Bone, passing to Scaphoid and Cuneiform, interosseous | ^ gnd „ „ „ „ Os Magnum „ „ Trapezoid ,, Unciform. The Pisiform Bone is united to tlie Cuneiform by a Capsule lined by synovial membrane. EEN THE TWO BOWS. I short bands, passing between contiguous bones. LIGAMENTS BETWEEN THE TWO BOWS Palmar Dorsal Lateral External, the stronger ,, ,, Scaphoid and Trapezium. Internal, ,, weaker ,, ,, Cuneiform ,, Unciform. The Common Synovial Membrane, between the 1st and 2nd Rows, sends prolongations between the contiguous bones in each Row, and is prolonged below into the four inner Carpo-metacarpal Joints. LIGAMENTS OF OABPO-METACARPAL JOINTS. The First Joint (that of the Thumb), is a Special Joint witli its own Capsule and Synovial Membrane. In the other Carpo-metacarpal Joints, the Ligaments are as follow : the 2nd from \ Trapezoid!' Os Magnum. Unciform. The other Bones each receive one fasciculus, the 3rd from Os Magnum, the 5th from Unciform. Palmar, —as in Dorsal, except that the 3rd has two extra bands, one from Trapezium, the other from Unciform.

( single, between contiguous inferior margins of Os Magnum and Unciform, and Ulnar side of Base of 3rd Metacarpal. Interosseous < This Ligament sometimes isolates the cavity of the Joint between Unciform and 4th and 5th Metacarpals ( from the Common Synovial Cavity.

217 THE STERNO-COSTO-CLA VICULAR to the other. The fibres in front, the anterior sterno-clavicular ligament, are well marked, but more lax and less tough than the posterior, and are overlaid by the tendinous sternal origin of the sterno-mastoid, the fibres of which run parallel to those of the ligament. They extend obliquely upwards and outwards from the margin of the sternal facet to the anterior surface of the clavicle some little distance from the articular margin. The fibres which cover in the joint below are short, woolly, and consist more of fibro-areolar tissue than true fibrous tissue; they extend from the upper border of the first costal cartilage to the lower border of the clavicle just external to the articular margin, and fill up the gap between it and the rhomboid ligament. The superior portion consists of short tough fibres passing from the sternum to the interarticular cartilage; and of others welding the fibro- Fig. 220.â€”Anterior View of Sterno-costo-clavicular Joint. (The capsule is cut into on the left side to show the interarticular fibro-cartilage dividing the joint into two cavities.) Rhomboid ligament cartilage to the upper edge of the clavicle, only a few of them passing from the clavicle direct to the sternum. The interclavicular ligament (figs. 219 and 220) is a strong, concave band, materially strengthening the superior portion of the capsule. It is nearly a quarter of an inch (6 mm.) deep, with the concavity upwards, its upper border tapering to a narrow, almost sharp edge. It is connected with the posterior superior angle of

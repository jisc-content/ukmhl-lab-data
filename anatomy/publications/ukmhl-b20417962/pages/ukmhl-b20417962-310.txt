256 THE A R TIOULA TIONS attached above to the femur close to the articular margins of the condyles, stretch- ing across the upper margin of the intercondyloid notch, to which it is connected by fibro-fatty tissue; it thus reaches across from the internal to the external lateral ligaments. Below, it is fixed to the border of the outer tuberosity of the tibia, to the bone just below the popliteal notch, and to the shaft of the tibia below the inner tuberosity, blending with the descending slip of the semi- membranosus and internal lateral ligament. Superficially, an oblique fasciculus from the semimembranosus runs across the centre, passing upwards and outwards from near the back part of the inner tuberosity of the tibia to the external condyle of the femur where it joins the outer head of the gastrocnemius, a sesamoid plate being sometimes developed at the point of junction. This slip greatly strengthens Fig. 246.â€”Anterior View of the Internal Ligaments of the Knee-joint. the posterior ligament, of which, if not the chief constituent, it is at least a very important part. Its deep surface is closely connected with the semilunar cartilages (especially the inner) and coronary ligaments, and in the interval between the cartilages with the posterior crucial ligament and fibro-fatty tissue within the joint. Superficially it forms part of the floor of the popliteal space. The capsular or anterior ligament (fig. 246) is thin but strong, covering the synovial membrane under the quadriceps extensor tendon, and looking like a loose sac. It is attached to the femur near the articular margin on the inner side, but further away on the outer; it passes beneath the external lateral ligament to join the sheath of the fjopliteus. Internally it joins the internal lateral ligament. Below, it is fixed to the upper and lateral borders of the patella and the anterior border

IXFEBIOR MESENTERIC—MIDDLE SACRAL 563 of the internal sphincter, where, by their anastomosis, they form a series of loops around the lower part of the rectum. The chief variations in the inferior mesenteric are :—(A) Its place may be supplied by the superior mesenteric. (B) It may give branches to the liver or kidney. (C) It may give off the middle colic. (D)lit may give off a stem to both umbilical arteries. (E) The anastomosis between the middle and left colic arteries maybe wanting—the normal condition in the ruminants and the porcupines. C. The Terminal Branches of the Abdominal Aorta THE MIDDLE SACRAL ARTERY The middle sacral artery is, anatomically, the continuation of the aorta and is generally but not universally held to be the homolosjue of the sacral and coccygeal aorta of some animals. The so-called coccygeal glomerulus, or Luschka's gland* in winch it terminates, is believed to contain the rudiments of the caudal aorta,'or artery of the tail. The artery is mesially placed, and extends from the bifurcation , ,the .ao,rt;l to the tip of the coccyx. As it passes downwards into the pelvis, it runs behind the left common iliac vein, the hypogastric plexus of the sympathetic nerve and the layer of peritoneum that descends from the mesentery into the pelvis to become the meso-reetum. It lies successively upon the intervertebral disc between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebra?, the fifth lumbar vertebra, the intervertebral disc between that vertebra and the sacrum, and lower down upon the middle of the anterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx.

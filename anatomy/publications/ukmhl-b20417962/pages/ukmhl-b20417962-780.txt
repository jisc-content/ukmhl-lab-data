700 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM laminae. It also receives fibres from the inner segment of the globus pallidus. The ansa lentic- ularis enters the subthalamic region and passes beneath the red nucleus, where it becomes indistinct. The claustrum is a thin band of grey matter which is placed, nearly vertically, external to the lenticular nucleus, and separated from the latter, except at its lower part, by the outer capsule. It is separated from the grey matter of the island of Reil by a layer of white matter, into which it sends small pointed processes cor- responding to the gyri operti of the island. It is fused at its anterior end with the amygdaloid nucleus. (Hill.) Fig. 419.—Horizontal Section of the Ceeebeum. (After Landois and Stirling.)

The taenia semicircularis, or stria terminalis, is a band of fibres which passes; upwards and backwards from the anterior pillar of the fornix, traversing the groove between the caudate nucleus and the optic thalamus. It accompanies the caudate nucleus into the roof of the descending cornu, and ends in the amygdaloid nucleus. In its course along the groove above mentioned it is partly covered by! the vein of the corpus striatum and by a thickened band of ependyma, the lamina cornea, which also covers the A^ein.

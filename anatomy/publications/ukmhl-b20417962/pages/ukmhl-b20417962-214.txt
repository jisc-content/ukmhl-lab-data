162 THE SKELETON is received by the posterior surface of the scaphoid. On the inner and lower part, at the spot where the sustentacular facet becomes confluent with that on the head, there is a smaller facet separated by a ridge: this plays u|>on the calcaneo-scaphoid or spring ligament. The os trigonum.—Occasionally the small portion of the astragalus posterior to the trochlear surface containing the groove which lodges the flexor longus Fig. 168.—The Left Asteagalus. (Plantar view.) BODY NECK FOR THE CALCANEO-SCAPHOID (OR THE SPRING) LIGAMENT FOR SCAPHOID hallucis tendon is separate from the rest of the astragalus, and is known as the os trigonum, or secondary astragalus (fig. 169). Articulations.—The astragalus articulates with four bones, the tibia, fibula, scaphoid, and calcaneum; and presents seven articular facets; and when the facet for the sustentaculum tali is divided, as is so often the case, the articular surfaces Fig. 169.—An Asteagalus with the Os Trigonum. OS TRIGONUM are increased to eight. Sometimes it presents a facet on the outer margin of its head for the cuboid, thus increasing the articular surfaces to nine. Ligaments :— Internal lateral ligament (deltoid). External lateral ligament. Astragalo-scaphoid. Calcaneo-astragaloid (interosseous). External calcaneo-astragaloid. Posterior calcaneo-astragaloid.

THE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION 922 cially the case in the regions of the inferior, and the lower parts of the anterior borders where two layers of parietal pleura are in contact with each other, these regions are known as the pleural sinuses, and they vary in extent with the disten- sion of the lungs. The right pleural sac, though shorter and wider than the left, reaches as a rule somewhat higher in the neck. The Lungs.â€”Each lung presents an outer and an inner surface, separated by an anterior and a posterior border, with a base and an apex. The outer surface is convex, and mainly corresponds to the concavity of the inner surface of the lateral wall of the thorax. The inner surface is concave, and comes into contact with the pericardium and lateral pleural wall of the mediastinal spaces. The posterior border is the longer; it is thick, rounded, and smooth, and occupies the groove on the side of the vertebral column. The anterior border is thin, irregular, and sharply edged, and is deeply notched in the left lung leaving the pericardium uncovered. The base is concave, and rests on the corresponding arch of the diaphragm; whilst the apex passes above the anterior part of the first rib to lie beneath the subclavian artery. Each lung is divided into two lobes by a deep fissure which passes obliquely upwards and inwards almost to the root of the organ. This fissure commences at the posterior border, about 7'5 cm. below the apex, and, sweeping round the convex surface of the lung, ends near the anterior border below. In the right lung a second fissure passes from the anterior edge to reach the main fissure near its centre, marking off a third or middle lobe.

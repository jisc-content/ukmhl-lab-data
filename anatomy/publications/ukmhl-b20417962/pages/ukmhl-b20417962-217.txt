165 THE CUBOID Superior calcaneocuboid ligaments. External calcaneo-astragaloid. Inferior calcaneo-cuboid ligaments. Posterior calcaneo-astragaloid. Internal annular. Superior calcaneo-scaphoid. External annular. Inferior calcaneo-scaphoid. Blood-supply.—The calcaneum is a vascular bone, and derives its blood from the posterior tibial, and the internal and external malleolar arteries. Ossification.—The primary nucleus for this bone is deposited in the sixth month of embryonic life. In the tenth year a nucleus appears for the epiphysis at the heel, and unites with the body of the bone at the sixteenth year. The inner and outer tubercles are formed by the epiphysis. THE CUBOID This bone is situated on the outer side of the tarsus; its posterior surface is reniform in shape and articular for the anterior face of the calcaneum. The anterior surface is smaller, and divided by a low vertical ridge; the inner facet is for the base of the fourth, the outer facet receives the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. The upper (dorsal) surface is rough and non-articular. The inferior (plantar) surface is divided by a prominent ridge, which limits a deep furrow Fig. 172.—The Left Cuboid. (Inner view.)

FOR EXTERNAL CUNEIFORM FOR SCAPHOID lirected from without forwards and inwards. This, the peroneal groove, lodges he tendon of the peroneus longus. The corner of the ridge on the narrow outer (fibular) border of the bone is usually faceted for a sesamoid bone frequently found in the tendon of the peroneus pngus. The margin of the ridge and the surface of bone behind it afford attach- ment to the long and short plantar (calcaneo-cuboid) ligaments. The flexor brevis iallucis muscle has a small attachment to this part of the cuboid.

THE STOMACH 963 wards. This rotation about its long axis is influenced by the fixity of the lesser curvature of the organ. Structure.—The walls of the stomach consist of four coats,—serous, muscular, submucous, and mucous. Fig. 568.—Muscular Coat of the Stomach. (Luschka.) LONGITUDINAL LAYER CIRCULAR LAYER The external serous coat is formed by the peritoneum, and has to the naked eye the usual shiny appearance of that membrane. The muscular coat consists of three layers: A longitudinal layer externally, which is continued from similar fibres on the Fig. 569.—Muscular Coat of the Stomach. (Luschka.) OBLIQUE LAYER I \ CIRCULAR LAYER oesophagus, and is thickest along the curvatures, more particularly the lesser. At the pylorus the fibres are more regularly placed round that orifice (fig. 568). A circular layer, which regularly surrounds the whole stomach and becomes much thicker at the pyloric end, where it forms the sphincter. These circular fibres are arranged perpendicularly to the long axis of the stomach (fig. 569).

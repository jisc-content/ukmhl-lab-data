THE TONGUE 885 Each papilla presents a narrow attached base and a broad free end, and is seated in a circular cup which is surrounded by a rim or vallum. Upon the bases of most of these papillae a central depression marks the orifice of one or more glands. Secondary papilla? lie hidden under the thick epithelial covering both of the chief papilla and the circular rim which surrounds it. The fungiform papillae are more thinly covered with epithelium, and are redder in colour than the smaller papillae amongst which they are scattered. They occur ir- regularly over the dorsum, sides, and tip of the tongue, and are most numerous in the two latter situations; each papilla is attached by a comparatively narrow base and has a broader, rounded, and free extremity, studded with smaller secondary papillae.

EXTREMITY OF CORNU OF False vocal cord LOWER END OF PHARYNX The filiform or conical papillae, named from their general shape, thickly beset the whole of the dorsum, sides, and tip of the tongue in front of the circumvallate group. They faintly ridge the organ with delicate lines, which posteriorly lie parallel with the circumvallate papillae, but become more and more transverse in direction as they approach the tip and sides of the tongue. They present secondary papillae upon their surfaces thickly overlaid with epithelium. The lingual glands are especially abundant near the foramen caecum and in the neighborhood of the circumvallate papillae, as well as along the borders of the tongue.

THE CARPUS 129 The Scaphoid This is the largest bone of the proximal row. Its superior surface is somewhat triangular and convex for articulation with the lower end and styloid process of the radius. Its inferior surface has two facets: a large one for the trapezium, and a small one for the trapezoid. The dorsal surface is occupied by a long, deep groove for ligaments. The palmar surface is rough and concave above; below, it has a prominent tuberosity for the attachment of the anterior annular ligament and Fig. 134.—The Left Hand. (Dorsal surface.) SEMILUNAR the abductor pollicis muscle. The outer (radial) surface is rough for ligaments. The inner (ulnar) surface is occupied by two articular facets, of which the upper one is crescentic in shape for the semilunar bone, whilst the lower is deeply concave for the reception of the head of the magnum. Articulations.—With radius, trapezium, trapezoid, magnum, and semilunar. The Semilunar The semilunar has a convex superior surface for articulation with the lower end of the radius and the fibro-cartilage of the wrist. Its inferior surface is 9

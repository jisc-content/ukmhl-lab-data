818 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus muscles, and by the intermuscular part of the deep fascia of the leg. Lower down, as it approaches the ankle, it is covered only by the skin and fascia?. Its anterior relations are the tibialis posticus in the upper and the flexor longus digitorum and the- tibia in the lower portion of its course. The posterior tibial vessels are placed externally to its upper part; above the middle of the leg they cross in front of the nerve, and run downwards parallel to its inner side. Branches.—The posterior tibial nerve supplies the three deep muscles of the Fig. 4(39.—Superficial Nerves in the Sole of the Foot. (Ellis.) calf, viz. the tibialis posticus, flexor longus digitorum, and flexor longus hallucis, the two former by twigs from the fifth lumbar and the first sacral nerves, whilst the latter receives additional fibres from the second sacral nerve, and it gives a branch to the soleus. It also furnishes one or two articular filaments to the ankle-joint, and gives off a cutaneous branch, the internal calcaneal!. (1) The internal calcanean or calcaneo-plantar cutaneous branch contains fibres from the first and second sacral nerves. It arises from the posterior tibial nerve a little above the level of the inner malleolus, and passes under cover of the internal annular ligament, where it divides into several branches. These branches

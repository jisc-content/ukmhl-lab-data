THE WRIST AND HAND 1169 The posterior annular ligament is attached to the back of the outer margin of the radius above the styloid process, and internally to the back of the cuneiform and pisiform. It contains six tendon-compartments, of which four are on the radius. The outermost contains the two first extensors of the thumb; the second the two radial extensors of the carpus; the third, the extensor secundi internodii; Fig. 734. -Section of Cakpus, through the Unciform Bone.

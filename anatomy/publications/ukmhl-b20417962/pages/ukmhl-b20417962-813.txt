733 MENINGES OF THE SPINAL CORD posterior septum of the spinal cord, and serves to conduct blood-vessels to the cord. The space is also partially divided into a posterior and an anterior compartment by the ligamentum denticulatum. The pia mater of the cord consists of two layers, an outer and an inner, the latter of which represents, and is continuous with, the pia mater of the brain. Both layers dip into the anterior fissure of the cord, and the inner layer is continuous with the posterior septum. The outer layer is strong and fibrous, and Fig. 437.—Posterior View of the Medulla Oblongata and of the Spinal Cord, with its Coverings and the Eoots of the Nerves. (Hirschfeld and Leveille.)

The filum terminale may be conveniently described along with these. The ligamentum denticulatum is a fibrous band which is attached on each side of the cord about midway between the anterior and posterior nerve-roots. It is continuous by its inner margin with the pia mater. Its outer margin is charac- teristically scalloped or denticulated, and presents about twenty-one pointed pro- cesses by which it is attached to the dura mater. These processes do not pierce the

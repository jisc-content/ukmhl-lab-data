13 LUMBAR VERTEBRAE the tip of the partially suppressed transverse process, and the part in front is an undifferentiated rib. Between the transverse and costal elements some large vascular foramina are usually present, representing the costo-transverse foramina of other vertebrae. Occasionally the costal Fig. 13.—A Lumbar Vertebra. (Side view.) element differentiates, and becomes a well-developed lumbar rib. A glance at the spine will show that the accessory tubercles are in line with the thoracic transverse processes, and the costal ele- ments are in series with the ribs (see also fig. 29). Fig. 14.—A Lumbar Vertebra. (Showing the compound nature of the transverse process. Upper view.) The fifth lumbar vertebra has several distinguishing features. The centrum is much thicker in front than behind. The inferior articular processes are widely separated to articulate with the first sacral vertebra, The transverse processes are short and massive, and the pedicles are massive and flattened from above downwards; the spinous process is small.

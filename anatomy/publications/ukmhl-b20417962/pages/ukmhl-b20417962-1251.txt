THE WRIST AND HAND 1171 continued down to the finger to the base of the last phalanx. It is the contraction of the palmar fascia, especially of the slips to the two inner fingers, which gives rise to Dupuytren's contraction. Synovial membranes.—Beneath the anterior annular ligament lie two syno- vial sacs, one for the flexor longus pollicis, and one for the superficial and deep flexors of the fingers. They extend above the annular ligament to from one and a quarter to one inch and a half (31 to 37 mm.) below. That for the long flexor of the thumb reaches to the base of the last phalanx. That for the finger-flexors gives Fig. 737.—Diagram of a Vertical Section through the Middle of the Hand.

The one for the little finger also reaches to the base of the last phalanx. Those for the index, middle, and third fingers, end about the middle of the metacarpal bones. Traced from the insertions of the flexor profundus, the digital synovial sheaths extend upwards into the palm as far as the bifurcation of the palmar fascia (page 1169), i.e. into a point about opposite to the necks of the metacarpal bones, denoted on the surface by the crease which corresponds to the flexion of the fingers. Thus, about half an inch (12 mm.) separates the sheatbs of the outer three fingers from that large synovial sac beneath the annular ligament. There is no synovial sheath beneath the pulp of the fingers or thumb,

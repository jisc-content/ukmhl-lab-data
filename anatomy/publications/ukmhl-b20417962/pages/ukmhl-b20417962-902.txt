THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 822 by the great auricular, small occipital, and supraclavicular branches of the cervical plexus (fig. 469a), and posteriorly the skin of the neck is supplied by the small occipital nerve and by the internal branches of the posterior primary divisions of the cervical nerves from the second to the sixth inclusive (fig. 469b). Fig. 469a.—Diagram of the Cutaneous Neeve Areas of the Head and Neck. Red—First division of fifth. White—Second division of fifth. Blue—Third division of fifth. Dark shading—Posterior primary division of cervical nerve. Oblique shading—Ascending and transverse superficial branches of cervical plexus. Transverse shading—Descending superficial branches of cervical plexus. It must be understood the boundaries of each area are not distinct; wherever two areas meet they overlap. The Cutaneous Areas of the Body The skin over the anterior aspect of the body as far down as the second rib is supplied by the suprasternal and supraclavicular branches of the cervical plexus, which contain filaments from the third and fourth cervical nerves (fig. 469b); from the second rib to the lower part of the abdominal wall it receives the anterior cuta- - neous branches, and the anterior divisions of the lateral cutaneous branches of the dorsal nerves except the first, second, and twelfth (fig. 469b); and the skin over the :

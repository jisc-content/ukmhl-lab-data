THE ORGANS OF CIRCULATION 934 The auriculo-ventricular opening is guarded by the bicuspid valve. Its two unequal segments are larger and thicker than those on the right side of the heart, though the orifice itself is somewhat smaller, and they are similarly separated by smaller lobes or cusps. Of the two segments, the one, which is the larger and the more free and smooth, is placed in front and to the right between the two open- ings, whilst the other lies behind and to the left. The fibrous ring surrounding the orifice serves to give attachment to muscular fibres as well as to the valves. By its right border it is tied to the aortic ring by fibrous tissue, which also extends to the Fig. 553.â€”Posterior View of the Left Chambers of the Heart, with the Great Vessels and the Coroxary Sinus laid open.

In the angular space thus bounded there is imbedded a fibro-cartilage, which in some mammals is represented by a bone which is known as the os cordis. . The interventricular septum which separates the cavities of the ventricles is thickest below. In the greater part of its extent it consists of muscular tissue, but its upper portion, which intervenes not only between the two ventricles but also between the left ventricle and right auricle, is a fibrous septum devoid of muscle- fibres.

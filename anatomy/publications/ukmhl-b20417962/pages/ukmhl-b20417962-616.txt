542 THE ARTERIES osseous muscles as far as the flexure of the fingers, and there divide into two branches (dorsal digital), which run along the sides of the contiguous fingers on their dorsal aspect. Near their proximal ends they anastomose with the posterior perforating branches of the deep palmar arch. Distally they are connected by anterior perforating branches with the digital arteries of the corresponding spaces. Fig. 358.â€”The Eadial Artery at the Wrist, Left Forearm.

(2) The metacarpal or first dorsal interosseous artery (figs. 358, 359) arises from the radial artery beneath the extensor seeundi internodii pollicis, and, crossing the second metacarpal bone, passes downwards on the second dorsal

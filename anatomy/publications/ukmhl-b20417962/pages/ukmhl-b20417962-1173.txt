EYELIDS AND LACHRYMAL APPARATUS 1093 glands, lashes, and sebaceous follicles. Localised inflammation starting in any of these three structures, especially the last, will cause a ' stye.' The fre- quency with which the lid-border is the seat of that most troublesome chronic inflammation, blepharitis, and its result ' blear eye,' is explained by these ana- tomical points. Its circulation is terminal and slow; half skin and half mucous membrane, it is moister and more liable to local irritation than the skin; while its numerous glands readily participate in any inflammation. (8) The conjunctiva. To trace this important membrane, the lids should be everted, when the following will be noted. The conjunctiva over the tarsal part of the lid is closely adherent, and through it, a series of nearly straight, parallel, light yellow lines and granules, the Meibomian glands, can be seen. Beyond the tarsi, the conjunctiva, now pal- pebral, is thicker and freely movable, owing to the abundant submucous tissue. Numerous underlying vessels are visible here. Tracing the conjunctiva onwards over the sclerotic, the former becomes thinner and contains very few vessels, any present still moving with it (conjunctival). Occasional vessels seen through the sclerotic conjunctiva are attached to the sclerotic itself (anterior ciliary). At the junction of the palpebral and sclerotic conjunctiva? is the reflexion called the fornix. On this reflexion in the upper lid open the lachrymal ducts. Traced onwards over the cornea, the conjunctiva becomes thinned down to a mere epithelial layer, closely adherent to the subjacent parts. The differing structure of the palpebral and ocular portion has important bearings. Thus the palpebral is thick, highly vascular, and very sensitive. To

1001 THE GREAT OMENTUM The dotted line represents the position of the bag ; a and p represent sections of its anterior and posterior walls. The bag becomes larger and larger, and more and more pendulous, until it at last hangs down over the transverse colon and the small intestines as a kind of apron. Its orifice becomes narrowed in time by the growth of structures around it, and is known as the foramen of Winslow. If the finger be introduced into this foramen, it will touch the posterior wall of the stomach, and consequently the right (or posterior) layer of the original meso- Fig. 601.—Geeat Omentum in Macros us penicillatus. gaster. As both layers of the meso-gaster enter into the formation of this pouch or apron, it must of necessity be formed of four layers of peritoneum. The place where the bulging takes place is a matter of importance. Originally such part of the meso-gaster is involved in it as extends from the region of the pylorus to about the middle of the fundus of the stomach (fig. 600). In the lower mammals the rudimentary disposition of the great omentum is well seen. Thus in the two-toed anteater it may be observed in its simplest possible Fig. 602.—Formation of Geeat Omentum as seen in Vertical Section. condition. It here takes the form of a slight bag projecting towards the left, and formed solely by that part of the primitive meso-gaster which is nearest to the greater curvature of the stomach. It extends to the right as far as the pylorus. It is quite horizontal. Its greatest depth does not exceed an inch, and its orifice is a wide, shallow opening upon the right side of the meso-gaster. In higher mammals—as in some marsupials—the great omentum appears as a loose, pendulous, open bag, with so large an opening that it could not be termed a foramen. (Fig. 601 shows the great omentum in the kangaroo.)

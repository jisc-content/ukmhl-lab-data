THE LYMPHATICS 668 first, the popliteal, and then the femoral artery up the thigh to the deep inguinal or deep femoral glands. Deep lymphatics also run with the profunda artery. These also join the deep femoral lymphatic glands. Others accompany the gluteal and ischiatic artery, and end in the lymphatic glands of the same name at the great sciatic foramen. The deep lymphatic glands of the lower extremity are met with chiefly in the popliteal space and in the inguinal region. One, or sometimes two, small glands, however, may be found in the upper part of the front of the leg, lying on the interosseous membrane along the course of the anterior tibial artery. The popliteal glands are placed deep in the popliteal space around the popliteal Fig. 400a.â€”Diagram of the Superficial and Deep Lymphatic Vessels and Glands of the Lower Extremity, including the Superficial Lymphatics of the External Genitals and the Lymphatics of the Gluteal and Ischial Regions.

They receive the deep lymphatics from the leg, and those of the superficial which perforate the deej) fascia along with the external sajjhenous vein. Their efferent vessels accompany the popliteal and the femoral vessels to the deep inguinal or femoral glands. The deep inguinal or deep femoral glands surround the upper part of the femoral vessels. One or more are constantly found in the femoral canal. They receive the deep lymphatics accompanying the femoral artery, and a few of the efferent vessels from the superficial inguinal glands. Their efferent vessels pass, in part along the course of the femoral vessels, and in part through the femoral ring to join the glands along the course of the external iliac artery.

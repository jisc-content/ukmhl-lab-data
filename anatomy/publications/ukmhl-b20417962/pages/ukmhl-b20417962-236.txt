THE AR TIOULA TIONS 184 The arterial supply is derived from twigs of the vertebral, and occasionally from twigs from the meningeal branches of the ascending pharyngeal. The nerve-supply comes from the anterior division of the suboccipital nerve. Movements.—By the symmetrical and bilateral arrangement of these joints, security and strength are gained at the expense of a very small amount of actual articular surface; the basis of support and the area of action being equal to the width between the most distant borders of the joint. The principal movement permitted at these joints is of a ginglymoid character, producing flexion and extension upon a transverse axis drawn across the condyles at their slightly constricted parts. In flexion, the forehead and chin drop, and what is called the nodding move- ment is made; in extension, the chin is elevated and the forehead recedes. Fig. 194.—Anterior View of the Upper End of the Spine. There is also a slight amount of gliding movement, either directly lateral, the outer edge of one condyle sinking a little within the outer edge of the socket of the atlas, and that of the opposite condyle projecting to a corresponding degree. The head is thus tilted to one side, and it is even possible that the weight of the skull may be borne almost entirely on one joint, the articular surfaces of the other being thrown out of contact. Or the movement may be obliquely lateral, when the lower side of the head will be a trifle in advance of the elevated side. In this motion, which takes place on the antero-posterior axis, one condyle advances slightly and approaches the middle line, while the other recedes. This is of the nature of rotation, though there is no true rotation round a vertical axis possible between the occiput and atlas. These lateral movements are checked by the lateral odontoid ligaments and the

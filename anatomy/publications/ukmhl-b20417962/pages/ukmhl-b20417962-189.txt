THE PHALANGES 137 Ossification.—Each metacarpal is ossified from two centres. The nucleus for the shaft appears about the eighth week of embryonic life. At birth the shafts are well ossified, but each end is capped by a piece of cartilage. In the case of the first metacarpal, a centre for the epiphysis appears at the proximal end in the course of the third year. The bases of the remaining metacarpals are ossified from the shaft, but an epiphysis forms for the head of each bone in the third year. The bones are usually consolidated by the twentieth year. In many cases the first metacarpal has two epiphyses, one at the base and an additional one at the head; the latter is never so large as in the other metacarpal bones. The third metacarpal occasionally has an additional nucleus for the prominent styloid process which constitutes such a distinguishing feature of this bone. The styloid process sometimes remains distinct, and is then known as the styloid bone. Occasionally it fuses with the trapezoid or magnum. THE PHALANGES The phalanges are the bones of the fingers. They number in all fourteen: the thumb has two, the other fingers three each. Each phalanx has a shaft, which is broad and slightly concave on the palmar, Fig. 149.—The Phalanges of the Third Digit of the Hand. (Dorsal view.) rounded and smooth on the dorsal aspect. The sides of the palmar surface are raised where they give attachment to the sheaths of the flexor tendons. The base of each phalanx of the first row presents a glenoid fossa which plays upon the convex head of the metacarpal bone. The distal end is surmounted by miniature condyles.

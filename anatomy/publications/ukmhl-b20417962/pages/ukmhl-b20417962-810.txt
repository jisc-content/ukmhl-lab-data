730 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM infero-lateral border of the hemisphere, the line in question will indicate the adja- cent margins of the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes of the brain. The occipital bone is in close relation with the cerebellum, as already pointed out, but it also covers the posterior part of the outer surface of the occipital lobe of the cerebrum. The great wing of the sphenoid covers the outer surface of the apex of the temporal lobe, and the squamous part of the temporal bone covers the anterior parts of the superior, middle, and inferior temporal convolutions and the sulci which separate them. In every consideration of the topographical relations of the cerebral convolutions to the walls of the cranial cavity it must be borne in mind that the conditions are Fig. 434.—Drawing of a Cast of the Head of a Newly-born Male Infant. (Prepared by Professor Cunningham to illustrate cranio-cerebral topography.) INTRA- PARIETAL FISSURE EXTERNAL PARIETO- OCCIPITA L FISSURE FISSURE OF ROLANDO POSITION OF PARIETAL EMINENCE POSITION OF FRONTAL EMINENCE FISSURE OF SYLVIUS PARALLEL FISSURE not constant, and that, therefore, the relations are variable. The three main factors upon which this variability depends are age, sex, and the shape of the skull. As examples of the variations which occur it may be mentioned that the fissure of Sylvius is higher in the child than in the adult (compare figs. 433 and 434). The upper end of the fissure of Rolando is further away from the coronal suture in the female and the child than in the adult male, and in dolichocephalic than in brachycephalic heads. The angle formed between the line of the fissure of Rolando and the in^d-sagittal plane, which averages about 69° in the adult, is more acute in dolichocephalic heads, and the external parieto-occipital fissure is further forwards in the child, and possibly in the female, than it is in the adult male.

THE MUSCLES 308 and at the bend of the elbow the median cephalic vein and brachio-radialis; deeply, the humerus, the brachialis anticus, and supinator brevis; upon its inner side lie the coraco-brachialis, the brachial vessels, and the median nerve. The semilunar fascia separates the median basilic vein from the brachial vessels and median nerve. Fig. 271.—Deep View of the Front of the Upper Arm. Long head of biceps Insertion of peetoraliB major Insertion of deltoid Brachialis anticus Outer part of brachialis anticus Variations.—The origin of the biceps is remarkably variable. Sometimes one of the heads is deficient. More often a third head is derived from the middle of the inner border of the humerus, and sometimes as many as three additional heads have been found arising from the humerus. Occasionally it sends slips to the internal intermuscular septum, internal condyle, or coronoid process. 2. BRACHIALIS ANTICUS The brachialis anticus—named from its intimate relation with the front surface of the bone of the upper arm (brachium)—is a thick, somewhat fusiform sheet, curved from side to side to fit on to the convex anterior surface of the humerus, and slightly bifid above.

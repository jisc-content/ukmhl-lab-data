MUSCULAR A TTA CHMENTS 1 1 a rule, are simple. The only cervical vertebra which presents a bifid spine in all races is the axis; even this may be non-bifid in the Negro, and occasionally in the European. (Owen, Turner, Cunningham. ) The laminae of the lower cervical vertebra? frequently present over the inferior articular processes distinct tubercles from which fasciculi of the multifidus spinas muscle arise. They are usually confined to the sixth and seventh vertebra?, but are fairly frequent on the fifth, and are occasionally seen on the fourth. Fig. 12.—Peculiar Thoracic Vertebrae.

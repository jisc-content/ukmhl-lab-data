THE ORBITS 77 foramen); and the suture between the frontal bone and the nasal process of the maxilla; and in the inferior segment of the circumference is the malo-maxillary suture. Occasionally, the infraorbital foramen opens by a narrow fissure into ttie orbit. The roof of the orbit is formed mainly by the orbital plate of the frontal bone, and completed posteriorly by the lesser wing of the sphenoid. At the outer angle it presents the lachrymal fossa for the lachrymal gland, and at the inner angle a depression for the pulley of the superior oblique muscle. Fig. 85.â€”The Skull. (Norma facialis.) SUPERCILIARY RIDGE GLABELLA SUBNASAL POINT CANINE FOSSA CANINE EMINENCE ALVEOLAR POINT The floor is formed by the orbital plate of the maxilla, the orbital process of the malar, and the orbital process of the palate bone. At its inner angle it presents the lachrymal canal, and near this a depression for the origin of the inferior oblique muscle. The floor has a furrow for the infraorbital artery and the second division of the fifth nerve. The furrow terminates anteriorly in the infraorbital canal, through which the infraorbital nerve and artery emerge on the face. Near the commencement of the canal a narrow passage, the anterior dental canal, runs for-

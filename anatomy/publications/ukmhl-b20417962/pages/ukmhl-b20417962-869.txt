BRANCHES OF BRACHIAL PLEXUSES 789 and musculocutaneous are more proximal in their distribution than the median, ulnar, and musculo-spiral, and may therefore be first described. (1) The circumflex nerve is a branch of the posterior cord, and is composed of fibres derived from the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. It accompanies the posterior circumflex artery through the quadrilateral space bounded by the teres major, long head of triceps, and subscapulars muscles, and by the surgical neck of the humerus, and it divides into a smaller posterior and a larger anterior division. Previous to its division it furnishes an articular twig to the shoulder joint. This twig pierces the inferior part of the capsular ligament. (a) The anterior division accompanies the posterior circumflex artery around the neck of the humerus, and gives off a number of stout twigs which enter the Fig. 456.â€”Distribution of Cutaneous Nerves on the Anterior and Posterior Aspects of the Superior Extremity. deltoid muscle. A few fine filaments pierce the deltoid and end in the integument which covers the middle third of that muscle. (6) The posterior division divides into cutaneous and muscular branches. The cutaneous branch supplies the skin covering the lower third of the deltoid and a small area of integument below the insertion of that muscle. One muscular branch is distributed to the teres minor; it swells out into an ovoid or fusiform reddish gangliform enlargement before entering the muscle, others supply the lower and posterior part of the deltoid. (2) The lesser internal cutaneous nerve, or nerve of Wrisberg, arises from the inner cord of the brachial plexus, and is formed of fibres derived from the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves or from the first thoracic nerve alone. It runs downwards on the inner side of the axillary vein, being separated by that

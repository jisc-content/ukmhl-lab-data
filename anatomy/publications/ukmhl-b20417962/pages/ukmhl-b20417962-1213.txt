1133 INGUINAL HERNIA fossettes; on the outer surface a separation between the fasciculi of the external oblique, carefully closed and protected; in the interval between the two surfaces lies the cord or round ligament, in the thickness of the abdominal wall. Length.—In very early life there is no canal; one ring lies directly behind the other, so as to facilitate the easy passage of the testis. In the adult it measures about an inch and a half (37 mm.) in length, this lengthening being brought about by the growth and separation of the'alas of the pelvis. This increased obliquity gives additional safety. Direction.—From internal to external ring, downwards, forwards, and in- wards. Boundaries.—For convenience sake, certain limits (largely artificial) have been named—- (1) Floor.—This is best marked near the outlet, where the cord rests on the grooved upper margin of Poupart's ligament. The meeting of the transversalis fascia with this ligament forms the floor. (2) Roof.—The apposition of the muscles and the arched border of the internal oblique and transversalis. (3) Anterior wall.—Skin, superficial fascia, external oblique for all the way. Internal oblique, i.e. that part arising from Poupart's ligament, for the outer third or so. (4) Posterior wall.—For the whole extent, transversalis fascia, extra-peritoneal tissue, and peritoneum. For the inner two-thirds, conjoined tendon of internal oblique and transversalis, and the outer edge of the triangular fascia, when devel- oped. Of the structures forming the posterior wall, the transversalis fascia is the strongest. It is thicker and better marked at its attachments below; these are —(a) externally, to inner lip of iliac crest; (I/) to Poupart's ligament between the anterior superior spine and the femoral vessels: here it joins the fascia iliaca; (c)

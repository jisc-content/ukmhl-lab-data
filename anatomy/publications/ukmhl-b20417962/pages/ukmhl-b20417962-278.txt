224 THE ARTICULATIONS tion, and can be with difficulty dissected off from it. The long head of the triceps supports and strengthens the capsule below. The capsule also receives an upward slip from the pectoralis major. The supra-spinatus often sends a slip into the cap- sule from its upper edge (fig. 224). Fig. 225.—Fcetal Shouldee-joint, showing the Gleno-humeeal Ligament, and also the Shoet Head of the Biceps, being continuous with the Coeaco-aceomial Ligament. Short tendon of biceps running on into anterior band of eoraeo- aeromial ligament — Long tendon of biceps — Gleno-humeral ligament — CapBule of shoulder, turned back — Subscapularis tendon, cut and turned outwards The coraco-humeral ligament (fig. 226) is a strong broad band, which is attached above to the outer edge of the root and horizontal limb of the coracoid process nearly as far as the tip. From this origin it is directed backwards along the line of the biceps tendon to blend with the capsule, and is inserted into the greater tuberosity of the humerus. Seen from the back, it looks like an uninterrupted continuation of the capsule, while from the front it looks like a fan-shaped pro- longation from it overlying the rest of the ligament. At its origin there is some- times a bursa between it and the capsule.

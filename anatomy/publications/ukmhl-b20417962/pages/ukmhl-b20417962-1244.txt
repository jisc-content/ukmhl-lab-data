SURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY 1164 magnum, which supports the third or longest digit, and is the bone of the carpus most exposed to injury. A line drawn from the base of the fifth metacarpal bone to the radio-carpal joint, slightly curved downwards, will give the line of the carpo-metacarpal joints (Windle). When the ting ers are flexed, it will be seen that in each case it is the proximal bone which forms the prominence; thus, the knuckle is formed by the head of the metacarpal the interphalangeal prominence by the head of the first phalanx, and Fig. 728.—Anastomoses and Distribution of the Arteries of the Hand. 7 Anterior interosseous Radial artery Anterior radial carpal Superficial volar Posterior radial carpal Radial artery at wrist Dorsalis poll iris Metacarpal or first dorsal interosseous Priuceps poll ids Dorsal is indicts Radialis indit First dorsal branch of collateral digital Second dorsal branch of collateral digital Anastomosis of collateral digital arteries about matrix of nail and pulp of finger — Ulnar arteru I / * I /_ A nterior ulnar carpal Posterior ulnar carpal Veep ulnar Superficial arch Carpal recurrent Posterior communis eating or perforat- ing Palmar interosseous Second, third, and fourth palmar digital Second and third dorsal interosseous Fir.st palmar digital Anterior communi- cating or perforat- ing the distal one by the head of the second. Thus, the joint in each case lies below the prominence, the distal joint being one-twelfth of an inch (2 mm.), the inter- phalangeal one-sixth (4 mm.), and the metacarpophalangeal one-third (8 mm.) below its prominence. Skin folds.—Two or three of these are seen on the palmar surface of the wrist; two lower down, and usually close together; and one less well marked a little higher up upon the forearm. None of these correspond exactly to the wrist-joint (page 1159). The lowest £ precisely crosses the arch of the os magnum in the line of the third metacarpal bone' (Tillaux), and is not quite three-quarters of an inch

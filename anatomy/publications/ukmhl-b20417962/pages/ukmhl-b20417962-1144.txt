■URINARY AND REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS 1064 fascia, at the anterior border of the levator ani; while behind it extends backwards for a variable distance to join again with the obturator fascia. In this way the two fascia?, obturator and ischio-rectal, close in the ischio-rectal fossa above, in front, and behind, but leave it widely open below. Fig. 652.—Sagittal Section through the Perineal Ledge and Ischio rectal Fossa to the Left of the Middle Line. (Diagrammatic.) (W. A.) Subperitonea Fascia trans Obturator i: Fascia lata < Muscles ( •space versus The ischio-rectal fossee (figs. 647, 64S, 652, 653) are two deep interspaces, one on each side, left by the divergence of the obliquely directed muscles of the pelvic floor (levator ani and coccygeus) from the vertical pelvic wall. Each fossa is bounded externally by the obturator internus below the level of the white line, the corresponding portion of the obturator fascia (with Alcock's canal and the pudic vessels and nerves), and the os innominatum; and internally by the levator ani and coccygeus and the ischio-rectal fascia. Superiorly, the vertical outer wall

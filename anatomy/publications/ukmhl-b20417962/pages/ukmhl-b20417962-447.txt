ADDUCTOR HALLUCIS 383 into the inner and outer part of the lower border of the base of the first phalanx, they are blended with the tendons of the abductor and the adductor hallueis. Nerve-supply.—From the internal plantar division of the posterior tibial nerve, by filaments which enter the under surface of the muscle near the middle of its inner border. Action.—To flex and slightly adduct the first phalanx of the great toe. The sesamoid bones give a slight obliquity to its insertion, and so enable it to act with more power; at the same time they form a groove in which the strong tendon of the flexor longus hallueis plays. They also form a somewhat elastic support when the weight is placed upon the ball of the foot. Relations.—Superficially, the abductor hallueis, the tendon of the flexor longus hallueis, and the inner tendons of the flexor longus digitorum with the lumbricales; deeply, the interossei and the termination of the external plantar vessels and nerve. Variations.—A small slip is occasionally given to the first phalanx of the second toe. Fig. 295.—Third Layer of the Muscles of the Sole. Divi< 2. ADDUCTOR HALLUCIS The adductor hallueis—named from its action upon the great toe—is a tri- angular sheet, the apex of which is directed forwards and inwards. Origin.—(1) The continuation forwards of the long plantar ligament which forms the sheath of the peroneus longus tendon; (2) the under surface of the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones.

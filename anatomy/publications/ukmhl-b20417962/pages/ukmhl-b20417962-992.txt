THE ORGANS OF VOICE 912 On pronation the cords become parallel and closely approximated, and the vocal processes approaching each other cause the angle to be turned inwards. The infrarimal portion of the larynx rapidly widens out into a nearly circular cavity at the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, from which point it is continuous with the lumen of the trachea. Nerves.—The nerves of the larynx are derived from the superior and inferior (recurrent) laryngeal branches of the vagus. The superior laryngeal.—The sensory nerve of the larynx gives off near its origin behind the carotid sheath a long and slender filament, which is principally motor. This (external) branch is distributed to the crico-thyroid muscle, a few minute filaments reaching the mucous membrane of the larynx. Its larger and main branch (internal) is sensory, and passes through the aperture in the thyro-hyoid membrane above the superior laryngeal artery. It divides beneath the mucous membrane which lines the sinus pyriformis, distributing branches upwards to supply both surfaces of the epiglottis and the base of the tongue immediately in front; inwards to the aryteno-epiglottidean fold and its neighbourhood; whilst others pass downwards to the mucous membrane of the deeper portions of the larynx as far as the true vocal cords. The inferior (recurrent) laryngeal, the motor nerve of the larynx, ascends in the groove between the trachea and oesophagus, both of which structures it supplies. It reaches the larynx below the edge of the inferior constrictor, and immediately behind the crico-thyroid joint. At this spot it divides into two branches: an anterior to supply the thyro-arytenoideus, crico-arytenoideus lateralis, with the muscles of the epiglottis; and a posterior branch to the crico-arytenoideus posti- cus and arytenoideus.

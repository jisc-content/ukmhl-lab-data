THE INTER OSSEI 337 and part of the flexor brevis pollicis, and the deep transverse ligaments; on the ulnar side their tendons are in contact with the metacarpophalangeal joints. Variations.—The fourth luinbricalis is sometimes absent. They may vary in their origins, sometimes arising from one, and sometimes from two adjacent tendons. Occasionally one may arise from the flexor longus pollicis tendon. They may be inserted into the ulnar side of a finger, or into the adjacent sides of two fingers. 2. THE INTEROSSEI The interossei—named from their position between the metacarpal bones—are seven in number, three being palmar and four dorsal. They are small muscles, of penniform or bipenniform structure. Both sets are easily exposed to view by a Fig. 281.—The Palmak Interossei. deep dissection in the palm, but the dorsal set is alone visible in the back of the hand. The three palmar interossei are fusiform in shape. Origin.—They arise from the sides of the metacarpal bones: the first occupy- ing the whole of the ulnar side of the second metacarpal bone; the second, the radial side of the fourth metacarpal bone; the third, the radial side of the fifth metacarpal bone. Insertion.—By small tendons (1) into the aponeuroses of the extensor tendons upon the back of the first phalanges of the index, ring, and little fingers; and (2) the adjacent portion of the side of each first phalanx near to its base; the first being attached to the ulnar border, and the second and third to the radial borders of their fingers. Structure.—Fleshy fibres arising along the whole length of the metacarpal bone are inserted in penniform fashion upon the tendon, which, beginning on the unattached border of the muscle near the middle of the interosseous space, becomes free just above the metacarpophalangeal joint, and passes beneath the deep transverse ligament which separates it from the tendon of the lumbricalis muscle. 22

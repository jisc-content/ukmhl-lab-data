1153 THE SHOULDER tendon. Thus the continuity of the capsule is interrupted by two and sometimes three apertures. The shaft of the humerus is well covered by muscles in the greater part of its extent, especially above. Below the insertion of the deltoid, the outer border of the bone can be traced downwards into the external supracondyloid ridge. The inner border and ridge are less prominent. Attached to these ridges and borders are the intermuscular septa., each lying between the triceps and brachialis anticus, and the outer one giving origin to the brachio-radialis (supinator longus) and extensor carpi radialis longior as well. The outer septum is perforated by the Fig. 716.â€”Back View of the Scapulae Muscles and Triceps. superior profunda vessels and the musculo-spiral nerve, the inner by the inferior profunda and anastomotica magna arteries and the ulnar nerve. On either side of the well-known prominence of the biceps is a furrow. Along the outer ascends the cephalic vein. The inner corresponds to the line of the basilic vein which lies superficial to the deep fascia below the middle of the arm, and superficial and internal to the brachial vessels and median nerve. A line drawn along the inner edge of the biceps from the insertion of the teres major to the middle of the bend of the elbow corresponds to the brachial artery. In the upper two-thirds, this artery can be compressed against the bone by pressure outwards; in its lower third the humerus is behind it, and pressure

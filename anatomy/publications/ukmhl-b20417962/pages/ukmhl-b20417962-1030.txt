950 THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION outwards to the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and thence to the Eustachian tube and internal pterygoid plate. It descends along the ptery go-maxillary ligament to the posterior of the mylo-hyoid ridge of the lower jaw and passes thence along the side of the tongue to the hyoid bone and larynx. The mucous membrane of the pharynx is continuous with the several cavities which open into it. It is closely adherent to the base of the skull, thick and spongy and dark in colour. It becomes thinner where it approaches the openings of the posterior nares and Eustachian tubes, and below it is paler and folded longitudi- Fig. 559a.—The Muscles of the Pharynx. nally. Lymphoid follicles and numerous racemose glands exist throughout the mucous membrane. The epithelium is ciliated and columnar in the naso-pharynx, but becomes stratified and scaly in the lower portion. Muscles.—The muscular coat consists of the three constrictor muscles, with additional fibres derived from the stylo- and palato-pharyngei muscles. The inferior constrictor is thick and strong. It arises from the thyroid carti- lage immediately behind the oblique line and superior tubercle, and also from the inferior cornu and the side of the cricoid cartilage, behind the crico-thyroid muscle (fig. 524). The fibres spread backwards and inwards, the lowest horizontally, whilst those above ascend more and more obliquely, and are inserted into the

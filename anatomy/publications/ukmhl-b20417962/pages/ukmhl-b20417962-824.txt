THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 744 as surely paralyse the facial and hypoglossal nerves as if the nuclei of these nerves had been destroyed in the medulla. General distribution.—The olfactory, optic, and auditory nerves are exclu- sively nerves of special sense, and are distributed to the nose, the eye, and the ear, respectively. Of the remaining nerves, some are motor, others are mixed. The motor nerves are: the third, fourth, and sixth to the ocular muscles, the seventh to the platysma and to the superficial muscles of the face and scalp, and the twelfth to the muscles of the tongue. The mixed are the fifth, which is chiefly sensory to the face, teeth, eye, external ear, and fore part of the scalp, but also motor to the muscles of mastication; the ninth, which contains fibres for the special sense of Fig. 441.—Surface Origin of the Cranial Nerves.

In the following pages the course of each nerve is described in order from its so-called deep origin to its peripheral distribution; the ultimate connection with the cortex is described in the anatomy of the brain. An exception is made, how- ever, in the case of the olfactory and optic nerves, the cerebral connections of which are described in this place.

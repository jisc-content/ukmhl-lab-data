102 THE SKELETON The tenth rib has usually a single facet on its head. Occasionally a second is present. When this is the case, the ninth thoracic vertebra is not exceptional, and presents two demi-facets. The eleventh rib has a single facet on the head. The angle is feebly marked, and the subcostal groove shallow. It lacks a neck and tubercle. The twelfth rib has a large head furnished with one facet. The shaft is narrow, and its length extremely variable. It may be as short as 3 cm., or attain a length of 20 cm. (8"). The twelfth rib gives attachment to the following muscles:— Internal intercostal. External intercostal. Levator costae. Diaphragm. Transversalis abdominis. External oblique. Internal oblique. Serratus posticus inferior. Musculus accessorius. Sacro-lumbalis or ilio-costalis. Erector spinas. Quadratus lumborum. Latissimus dorsi. Pig. 111.—Eib at Puberty. EPIPHYSIS FOR THE HEAD. APPEARS AT FIFTEEN ; FUSES AT TWENTY-THREE EPIPHYSIS FOR TUBERCLE. APPEARS AT FIFTEEN; FUSES AT TWENTY-THREE THE CARTILAGINOUS SHAFT COMMENCES TO OSSIFY AT THE EIGHTH WEEK OF INTRA-UTERINE LIFE The costal cartilages are bars of hyaline cartilage attached to the anterior extremities of the ribs; they represent unossified epiphyses. Like the shaft of a rib, each has an outer and inner surface; the outer surfaces give origin and insertion to large muscles; and the inner surfaces, from the second to the seventh inclusive, are in relation with the triangularis sterni. The upper and lower borders serve for the attachment of the internal intercostal muscles. The upper seven cartilages, and occasionally the eighth, are connected with the sternum. The first fuses with the manubrium; the remaining six are received in small articular con- cavities, and retained by means of ligaments. The cartilages of the vertebro-chondral

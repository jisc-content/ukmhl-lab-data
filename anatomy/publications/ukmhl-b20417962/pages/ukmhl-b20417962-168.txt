THE SKELETON 118 interrupted by the musculo-spiral groove ; the lower half is termed the external condylar ridge, and affords attachment to the supinator longus and extensor carpi radialis longior muscles, and the external intermuscular septum. The ulnar or internal border commences at the lesser tuberosity, as the inner lip of the bicipital groove, and extends downwards to the ulnar (internal) condyle. Near its centre Fig. 125.—The Left Humerus with a Supracondyuoid Process and some Irregular Muscle Attachments. (Anterior view.)

The three borders considered above bound three surfaces. The external sur- face lies between the anterior and radial borders. Near its middle is a rough impression for the insertion of the deltoid; somewhat lower is the termination of

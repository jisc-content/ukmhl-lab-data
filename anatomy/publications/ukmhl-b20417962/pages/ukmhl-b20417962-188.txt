THE SKELETON 136 Muscles :— The third dorsal interosseous. The fourth dorsal interosseous. The second palmar interosseous. Blood-supply.—The nutrient artery is furnished by the second interosseous; it enters on the radial side of the shaft, and is directed towards the proximal end. Fig. 147.—The Foueth (Left) Metacarpal. The Fifth Metacarpal is readily distinguished. The carpal facet is convex for the unciform. The ulnar aspect of the base forms a rounded tubercle for the extensor car-pi ulnaris, whilst the radial side has a semilunar facet for the fourth metacarpal bone. The radial border of the dorsal surface of the shaft often has a prominent lip for the fourth dorsal interosseous muscle. Fig. 148.—The Fifth (Left) Metacarpal. RADIAL SIDE FOURTH METACARPAL Muscles:— Flexor carpi ulnaris. Extensor carpi ulnaris. ULNAR SIDE Fourth dorsal interosseous. Tbird palmar interosseous. Opponens minimi digiti. Blood-supply.—The nutrient artery is derived from the third interosseous. It enters the shaft on the radial side, and is directed towards the proximal end.

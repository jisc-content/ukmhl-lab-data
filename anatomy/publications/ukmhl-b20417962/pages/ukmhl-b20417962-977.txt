897 THE NOSE The anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries derived from the ophthalmic supply the upper portion of the septum, the roof, the outer wall (anteriorly) and the anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells. The descending palatine of the internal maxillary sends a few small branches to the back of the inferior meatus and lower turbinal bone. The Vidian and pterygo-palatine supply the back part of the roof. The branch to the septum derived from the superior coronary of the facial ramifies in the membrane covering its lower and front portion. The veins form a plexus in the mucous membrane, especially marked at the lower and hinder portions of the fossa. The emissary trunks accompany the arteries, the spheno-palatine joins the pterygoid plexus, the ethmoidal pass to the ophthalmic vein but also have communications with the meningeal veins, and the anterior part of the plexus is drained by veins which pass forwards to termi- nate in the tributaries of the facial vein. Communications are formed with the veins within the cranial cavity, through the cribriform foramina and foramen caecum, and also with the facial vein through small foramina in the nasal bone and nasal process of the maxilla. The lymphatics form a well-developed plexus, which communicates, through the lymphatics surrounding the olfactory nerves, with the subdural space within the cranial cavity, posteriorly with the pharyngeal lymphatics, and anteriorly with the lymphatics of the face. 57

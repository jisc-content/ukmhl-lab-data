977 THE LIVER The inferior surface consists of that part of the liver in front of and including the transverse fissure. It is irregularly concave. It is covered by peritoneum, except where the gall-bladder comes in contact with its surface, and at the trans- verse fissure where the lesser omentum leaves the liver. It consists of three parts —viz., the quadrate lobe, nearly all the left lobe, and the under surface of the right lobe (fig. 580). This inferior surface is divided into right and left sections by the longitudinal fissure which forms the inferior separation between the right and left lobes. The part of the longitudinal fissure seen on this surface is known as the umbilical fissure from its containing during foetal life the umbilical vein, the remains of which are now to be seen as the round ligament. It runs from before Fig. 578.—The Viscera of the Foetus. (Rudinger.) artery backwards, meeting the transverse fissure behind. The portion of the left lobe included on this surface is much smaller than the similar surface of the right lobe. It lies over the cardiac part of the stomach and the anterior surface adjoining the lesser curvature, and shows an impression (impressio gastrica) made by that organ. Its anterior border is sharp and free; but behind, the separation from the posterior surface is very ill defined. The under surface of the right lobe is divided into two by the gall bladder, which is contained in a fossa (the fossa of the gall bladder). The inner of these two portions, which is bounded by the umbilical fissure to the left, the fossa of the gall bladder to the right, and the transverse fissure behind, is called the quadrate lobe, 62

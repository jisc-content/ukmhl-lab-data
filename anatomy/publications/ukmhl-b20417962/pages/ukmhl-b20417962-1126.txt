THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS 1046 sure, about a quarter of an inch (6 mm.) in lengthy bounded by two prominent labia, anterior and posterior, both of which are in contact with the posterior wall of the vagina. The anterior lip is the thicker, the shorter, and the lower; the pos- terior lip is longer on account of the greater height of the posterior vaginal fornix. After childbirth the labia usually become notched and irregular. Dimensions.—The size of the uterus varies within wide limits. Its average Fig. 637.—Frontal Section ok the Virgin Uterus. (After Sappey.) length in the nulliparous adult is about two and a half inches (6 cm.) and its greatest breadth about an inch and a half (4 cm), but in women who have borne children these dimensions are about one-fifth greater. Its weight averages seven drachms in nulliparae, nine to twelve drachms in multiparas. Direction.—The direction of the uterine axis is undoubtedly variable, and it is Fig. 638.—Sagittal Section of the Virgin Uterus. (After Sappey.)

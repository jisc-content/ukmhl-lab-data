THE ELBOW 1157 region is due to inflammation of the bursa between the olecranon and the triceps. A swelling on the inner side of the elbow-joint, if painful and accompanied by inflammation of the skin, may be due to mischief in the epitrochlear gland situated just above the internal condyle, and receiving lymphatics from the inner border of the forearm and the two inner fingers. The hollow in front of the elbow.â€”The delicacy of the skin here must always be borne in mind in the application of splints. The |\/|-hke arrangement of the superficial veins as usually described is by no means constant (figs. 719, 720). The median basilic is the vein usually chosen for venesection, owing to its larger size and its being firmly supported by the subjacent bicipital fascia which separates it from the brachial artery; but the median cephalic is the safer. The median basilic is crossed by branches of the internal cutaneous nerve, while those of the musculo-cutaneous lie under the median.cephalic. In the semiflexed position, the fold of the elbow is seen, a little above the level of the joint. This forms the base of the triangular fossa below the elbow, the outer side corresponding to the brachio-radialis, the inner to the pronator radii teres, and the apex to the meeting of these muscles. The tendon of the biceps can be easily made out in the centre of the fossa, giving off above the bicipital fascia from its inner side to fasten down the flexors of the forearm. Under the tendon on its inner side lie the brachial artery and the median nerve for a short distance. The musculo-spiral lies outside the fossa, between the brachio-radialis and the brachialis anticus. The brachial usually bifurcates opposite to the neck of the radius. The arterial anastomoses about the elbow-joint are as follow: The radial recurrent runs up under cover of the brachio-radialis to anastomose with the

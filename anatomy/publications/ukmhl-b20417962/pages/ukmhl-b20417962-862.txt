THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 782 ANTERIOR PRIMARY DIVISIONS The anterior divisions of the spinal nerves (with the two exceptions above men- tioned) are larger than the posterior divisions, and each is connected by one or two rami communicantes with the ganglionated cord of the sympathetic. In the cervi- cal, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal regions they combine to form plexuses; in the thoracic region each nerve takes for the most part an independent course, and its typical division into a lateral or dorsal, and an anterior or ventral branch is very obvious. This division, however, is not confined to the dorsal nerves; it is recog- nisable, though with more difficulty, in the lower cervical, lumbar, and sacral regions, and it cannot be clearly distinguished in the upper cervical and coc- cygeal regions. CERVICAL NERVES.—The anterior primary divisions of the upper four cervical nerves are of moderate size; each is connected by one or two branches with the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and they unite with one another to form a looped plexus, the cervical plexus.

The anterior division of the second nerve runs outwards behind the superior articular process of the axis, passes behind and to the outer side of the vertebral artery and in front of the second posterior intertransverse muscle to the interval between the scalenus medius and the rectus capitis anticus major, where it unites with the first and third nerves. The anterior divisions of the third and fourth nerves, after their exits from the intervertebral foramina, pass behind the verte- bral artery and between the anterior and posterior intertransverse muscles to appear in the interspace between the rectus capitis anticus major and the scalenus

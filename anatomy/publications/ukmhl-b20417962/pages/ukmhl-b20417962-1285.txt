ARCHES OF THE FOOT 1205 their separation when, in treading, the elastic anterior pillar tends to widen out. Of these numerous offsets, that to the scaphoid is the most important. Thus it strengthens the calcaneo-scaphoid ligament by blending with it, and thus supports the arch at a trying time. By coming into action when the heel is raised (fig. 768), this tendon helps the calcaneo-scaphoid ligament to support the head of the astragalus, and to maintain the arch of the foot when the weight of the body is thrown forward on to the instep. In other words, the tibialis posticus comes into play just when the heaviest of its duties is devolving upon this ligament, viz. when the heel is being raised, and the body-weight is being thrown over the instep on to the opposite foot. (5) Peroneus longus.—This raises the outer pillar, and steadies the outer side of the arch.

(6) Tibialis anticus.—This braces up the key- stone of the arch. Thus, by keeping up the internal cuneiform, it maintains the scaphoid, and so indirectly the astragalus, in situ. (7) Dr. Ellis (of Gloucester) has drawn especial attention to the action of the long flexors as bow-strings or tie-rods as they tighten in their contraction, and so diminish the distance between their points of attachments to the toes and the spot where the tendons pass round the os calcis, thus bracing up the arch. Of these flexors the flexor longus hallucis has especial influence, as shown by the stage- dancer, who supports herself literally on one toe. The flexor longus digitorum, while of less influence than the flexor longus hallucis, serves two important

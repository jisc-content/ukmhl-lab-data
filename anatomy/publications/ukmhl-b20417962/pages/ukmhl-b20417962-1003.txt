923 THE LUNGS The right lung is somewhat larger than the left; it is also shorter, and, as just mentioned, possesses three lobes. Above the middle of the inner aspect, but nearer to the posterior than the ante- rior border, each lung is connected to the pulmonary vessels and bronchi which form the main part of its root. The root of the lung is composed of the pulmonary artery and the pul- monary veins with the corresponding bronchial tube ; and, in addition, the bronchial vessels, the branches of the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses with some bronchial lymphatic glands and areolar tissue—the whole being encased in a pleural covering. The right root lies behind the superior cava and upper portion of the right Fig. 544.—Posterior View of the Thorax with Chest Wale Removed, showing the LUNGS. (Modified from Bourgery.) auricle of the heart, the anterior pulmonary plexus and the phrenic nerve; above, the vena azygos major arches to join the superior cava; behind is the posterior pulmonary plexus, the pneumogastric nerve, and the vena azygos major; whilst below is the ligamentum latum pulmonis. The left root has the pulmonary plexus and left phrenic in front; above it is the arch of the aorta; behind, the descending aorta and pneumogastric nerve with the posterior pulmonary plexus; whilst below stretches downwards the ligamentum latum pulmonis. The chief structures contained within the root vary in position on the two sides. From above downwards on the right side, they lie as follows—bronchus, artery, and upper vein; whilst on the left side the'artery is the highest, the

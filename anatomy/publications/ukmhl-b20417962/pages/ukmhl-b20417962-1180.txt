1100 SURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY inner border, the thicker and better marked of the two, overlaps the carotids; the common carotid corresponding, as far as the upper border of the thyroid, with a line drawn from the sterno-clavicular joint to midway between the mastoid process and the angle of the jaw. The artery can be best compressed above the level of the cricoid, as here it is less deeply covered. The transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra is called the carotid tubercle, after Chassaignac, who advised com- pression of the carotid at this point. This process lies two to three inches above the clavicle. Compression below it will command the vertebral as well. The student should recall the deep relations of the sterno-mastoid, which he may Fig. 674.â€”Thymus Gland in a Child at Bieth.

Of the two heads of the sterno-mastoid, the sternal is the thicker and more prominent, the clavicular the wider. A stab through the space (or interval) which lies between the two heads would wound the bifurcation of the innominate on the right side, and the common carotid on the left.

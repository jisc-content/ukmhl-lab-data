This is the precise attachment made evident when the intestines have been all cut away, and nothing but the stump of the mesentery is left (fig. 599). The attachment is, however, wholly acquired or secondary, and has been brought about by an extensive readjustment of the peritoneum. The real Fig. 599.â€”Diagram to show the Lines along which the Peritoneum leaves the Wall of the Abdomen to invest the Viscera. (Cunningham.) Falciform ligament Left lateral ligament of liver of liver attachment of the mesentery is about the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, and this attachment obtains in mammals below man. In fig. 599 is shown the posterior wall of the abdomen after the removal of the intestines, together with the stomach, liver, and spleen. The lines of the various peritoneal reflexions are depicted in a diagrammatic manner. A line drawn downwards, commencing at the falciform ligament of the liver, and continued past the oesophagus, through the gastro-splenic omentum, descending meso-colon, and sigmoid meso-colon,

THE SKELETON 116 higher and more posterior; it is marked by three facets for the insertion of muscles: an upper one for the supra-spinatus, a middle for the infraspinatus, and an inferior for the teres minor. The lesser tuberosity is the more prominent; it serves for the insertion of the subscapularis. The furrow between the tuberosities lodges the long tendon of the biceps, extends downwards in the axis of the humeral shaft, and, Fig. 1-23.—The Left Humerus.

The margins of this, the bicipital groove, are called lips, and afford attachment to muscles. The pectoralis major occupies the whole length of the outer lip. The inner lip receives, below, the teres major, and above, the latissimus dorsi; the tendon of the latter muscle is also attached to the floor of the groove. Between the tuberosities, the transverse humeral ligament converts

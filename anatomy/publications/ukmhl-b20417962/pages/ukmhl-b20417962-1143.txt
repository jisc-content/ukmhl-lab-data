PELVIC FASCUE AND MUSCLES 1063 ligament. Its superior border is separated from the inferior border of the pirifor- mis by the vessels and nerves which escape from the pelvis below the latter muscle. Its inferior border is related to the posterior border of the levator ani. The muscle is often pierced by filaments of the fourth and fifth sacral and coccygeal nerves, which supply it and form a kind of plexus on its pelvic surface. It aids the levator ani in drawing forwards the coccyx. The recto-vesical fascia may be regarded as a lamina detached from the obturator fascia at the level of the upper border of the ' white line.' From this point it extends upon the pelvic surface of the levator ani and coccygeus to become reflected upon the viscera immediately related to the muscular floor of the pelvis, namely, the prostate and bladder (forming the capsule of the former and the ' true ligaments ' of the latter), the vasa deferentia and vesiculas seminales, the lower part of the rectum, and, in the female, the vagina and uterus. Its visceral portion is easy to trace in the immediate neighbourhood of its reflexion, but it becomes less distinct as it recedes from this point, and at length is undemonstrable. The ischio-rectal or anal fascia, originating at the white line below the fascial attachment of the levator ani, closely invests the parietal or ischio-rectal surface of this muscle, and that of its neighbour, the coccygeus, to blend in the region of the anus with the deep fascial covering of the external sphincter. In front it passes above the perinatal structures, becoming continuous with the superior triangular ligament (a prolongation of the obturator fascia), and meeting with the recto-vesical

THE PHALANGES 175 The third phalanges : Flexor longus digitorum; extensor longus digitorum. Ossification.—Like the phalanges of the fingers, those of the toes ossify from a primary and a secondary nucleus. The centres for the shaft appear during the eighth and tenth weeks of embryonic life; the secondary centres appear as thin scaledike epiphyses at the proximal ends between the fourth and eighth years. They consolidate earlier than the corresponding epiphyses in the fingers. The ungual phalanges, like those of the fingers, ossify from the distal extremity. The average dates of ossification of the bones of the foot:— Calcaneum Sixth month. Epiphysis Tenth year. Astragalus Seventh month. Cuboid At, or near, the ninth month. Scaphoid Fourth or fifth year. Internal cuneiform Third year. Middle cuneiform Fourth year. External cuneiform First year. Metatarsals Eighth to ninth week. Epiphyses Third year; consolidate at the twentieth year. Phalanges , Eighth to tenth week. Epiphyses Fourth to eighth year; consolidate about the eighteenth year.

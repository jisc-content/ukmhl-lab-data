763 FACIAL NERVE It crosses the membrana tympani at the junction, of the upper and middle thirds of that membrane. In this part of its course it runs forwards between the fibrous and mucous layers of the membrana tympani, passing on the inner side of the manubrium of the malleus. It leaves the tympanum by passing through the iter chorda? anterius, or canal of Huguier, and, after communicating with the otic gan- glion, passes forwards, under cover of the external pterygoid muscle, to gain the outer side of the lingual nerve, which it joins at an acute angle. Thence it runs in the sheath of the lingual nerve, a portion of its fibres, as already described (see Lingual Nerve), passing into the submandibular ganglion. Other fibres reach the sublingual gland, and the dorsum of the tongue. Fig. 449.â€”Superficial Distribution of the Facial and other Nerves of the Head. (After Hirschfeld ami Leveille.)

(2) The branches which arise from the facial nerve between the stylo-mastoid foramen and the terminal bifurcation are the posterior auricular and the nerves to the posterior belly of the digastric and to the stylo-hyoid muscles. A lingual branch is also described. (a) The posterior auricular nerve is the first branch of the extracranial por- tion of the facial. It passes between the parotid gland and the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and runs upwards in the deep interval between the

THE MUSCLES 396 space behind the thin posterior border of the sheet is filled by a thin membrane composed of fibres running in the same direction, and is called the internal intercostal fascia. Nerve-supply.—Branches from the intercostal nerves, Avhich are supplied to its outer surface or are given off where the nerves are concealed in the interior of the muscle. Action.—See below. Relations.—Superficially, the external intercostal muscles, and the intercostal arteries and nerves; deeply, the triangularis sterni, infracostales, diaphragm, and the pleura. The action of the intercostal muscles generally is to approximate the ribs to one another, and they are chiefly used in inspiration. The obliquity of their fibres en- ables them with a small contraction to produce a greater approximation than if they ran perpendicularly between the ribs (page 287). Moreover, if the fibres were all directed, like those of the outer sheet, downwards and forwards, there would lie a tendency for the lower ribs to be drawn backwards as well as upwards in inspiration; and if, on the other hand all the fibres were directed downwards and backwards like those of the inner sheet, the tendency would be for the lower ribs to be drawn forwards as well as upwards in inspiration. The combined action of the two sets produces the direct elevation of the ribs, the forward pull of the inner sheet being counteracted by the backward pull of the outer sheet. If the external intercostals were carried forwards as far as the sternum, they would tend to take the sternum as a fixed point and to depress the anterior extremities of the ribs. A similar result would follow the continuation backwards of the internal intercostals to the vertebral

1183 THE KNEE quadriceps, the patella needs to project very little; thus, only its upper third is in contact with the femur, its lower two-thirds now resting on the pad of fat between it and the tibia. (3) In semiflexion the middle third of the patella rests upon the most prominent part of the condyles (Humphry). While the bone now affords the greatest amount of leverage to the quadriceps, it is also submitted to the greatest amount of strain from this muscle, which is acting almost at a right angle to the long axis of the patella. This position may therefore be called ' the area of danger,' as, in a sudden and violent contraction, the patella may be snapped Fig. 749. -Deep Dissection" of the Gluteal Regiox. the Hunterian Museum.)

Below its articular surface for the femur it is separated from the tibia by a pad of fat and a deep bursa, save at the apex to which the ligamentum patellae is attached. When the knee-joint is bent, the trochlear surface of the former can be made out, with some difScultv, underneath the quadriceps expansion. The upper and outer angle of this surface forms a useful landmark (Godlee), as a line drawn from it to the adductor tubercle marks the level of the lower epiphysis of the femur.

POSTERIOR TIBIAL 591 At the inner ankle it lies beneath the internal annular ligament and abductor hallucis upon the internal lateral ligament of the ankle-joint. Here it has the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digitorum in front of it, and the posterior tibial nerve and the flexor longus hallucis behind and to its outer side. At times the posterior tibial nerve divides higher than usual, when one branch lies on the inner side of the artery, and the other branch on the outer side. The branches of the posterior tibial artery are:—(1) The peroneal; (2) the Fig. 377.—The Popliteal, the Posterior Tibial, and the Peroneal Artery, Right Side.

(1) The peroneal artery (figs. 374, 377) arises from the posterior tibial about one inch below the lower border of the popliteus muscle. At first forming a gentle curve with the convexity outwards, it approaches the fibula, and continues its course downwards close to that bone as far as the lower end of the interosseous membrane,

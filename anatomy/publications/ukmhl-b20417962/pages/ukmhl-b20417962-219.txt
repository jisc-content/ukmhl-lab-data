167 THE CUNEIFORM BONES Articulations.—With the head of the astragalus, with the three cuneiform bones, and frequently with the cuboid. Muscle attached to the scaphoid.—The tibialis posticus is inserted. Ligaments :— Dorsal, plantar, and interosseous cubo-scaphoid. Dorsal and plantar scapho-cuneiform. External and inferior calcaneo-scaphoid. Astragalo-scaphoid. Ossification.—The nucleus for the scaphoid appears in the course of the fourth year. The tubercle of the scaphoid, into which the tibialis posticus acquires its main insertion, occasionally develops separately, and sometimes remains distinct from the rest of the bone. THE CUNEIFORM BONES The cuneiform bones, three in number, are named from within outwards— internal, middle, and external. They are wedge-shaped. The INTERNAL. CUNEIFORM is distinguished by its large size, and from the fact that, when articulated, the base of the wedge is directed downwards, and the Fig. 177.—The Left Internal Cuneiform. (Internal surface.) FOR FIRST METATARSAL FACET FOR THE TENDON OF THE TIBIALIS ANTICUS sharp border upwards. The posterior surface is concave and pyriform for articu- lating with the inner facet of the scaphoid. The anterior surface is a reniform articular facet for the base of the first metatarsal. The internal surface is rough, and presents an oblique groove for the tendon of the tibialis anticus : this groove is limited inferiorly by an oval facet into which a portion of the tendon is inserted. Fig. 178.—The Left Internal Cuneiform. (External surface.) FOR SECOND METATARSAL FOR MIDDLE CUNEIFORM FOR SCAPHOID The external surface is concave and rough, except along the posterior and supe- rior borders. Near the anterior extremity of the superior border there exists a listinct circular facet for the inner side of the base of the second metatarsal. In ront of the facet a few fibres of the first dorsal interosseous muscle arise. The ■emaining sinuous articular facet is for the inner surface of the middle cuneiform.

539 RADIAL ficial and deep fascia, to expose the vessel, and in addition in the upper third to separate the supinator longus (humero-radialis) from the pronator radii teres. In front, the artery is at first overlapped by the supinator longus, but for the rest of its course it is merely covered by the skin, superficial and deep fasciae, by some cutaneous veins, and by cutaneous branches of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. Behind, it lies successively from above downwards on the tendon of the biceps, the supinator brevis, from which it is separated by a layer of fat, the insertion of the pronator radii teres, the radial origin of the flexor sublimis digitorum, the flexor Fig. 356.â€”Diagbaji of the Relation of the Abtebies of the Left Foreaem to the Boxes.

It is in this last situation, where the artery lies upon the bone and can therefore be easily pressed against it, that the pulse is usually felt. On its outer side it has, throughout the whole of its course, the supinator longus or humero-radialis muscle, the guide to the artery in ligature, and the external vena comes; in its middle third, the radial nerve as well. In its lower third the radial nerve is to its outer side, but separated from it by the supinator longus and fascia. On its inner side, in the upper third is the pronator radii teres, in the lower

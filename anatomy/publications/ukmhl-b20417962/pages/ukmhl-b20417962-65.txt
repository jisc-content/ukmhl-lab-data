23 THE VERTEBRJE The anterior segment of the atlas is most probably an enlarged hypapophysis or subvertebral wedge-bone, which, in lizards, exists on the ventral aspect of the column between individual centra. Similar ossicles occur in the lumbar region of the mole. (Froriep regards this segment as the ossified primitive ventral arch which precedes the body and which disappears after the formation of the latter in all the other vertebrae.) Fig. 29.â€”Morphology of the Transverse and Articular Processes. The neural arches and spinous processes are easily recognised throughout the various parts of the column in which complete vertebrae are present. The articular processes are of no morphological value, and do not require consideration here. The transverse processes offer more difficulty. They present themselves in the simplest form in the thoracic series. Here they articulate with the tubercles of the ribs. The transverse pro-

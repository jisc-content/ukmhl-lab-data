THE MUSCLES 306 GROUP OF MUSCLES WHICH MOVE THE ELBOW-JOINT FASCIiE OF THE UPPER ARM The deep fascia of the upper arm forms a strong tube, thicker upon the pos- terior than the anterior aspect, enclosing all the muscles and most of the vessels and nerves. Above, it is continuous on the outer side and front with the fascia covering the deltoid and pectoralis major, and internally with the axillary fascia. In the Fig. 270.â€”Superficial View of the Front of the Upper Arm. Deltoid Outer head of triceps Brachialis antieus Extensor carpi radialis longior Brachio-radialis lower two-thirds of the upper arm it is joined upon its deep aspect by two strong processes: the external intermuscular septum, which arises from the external condylar ridge and the outer border of the humerus; and the internal intermuscular septum, which arises from the internal condylar ridge and the inner border of the humerus. The tube formed by the deep fascia is thus divided by the bone and these two septa into two compartments. In the front compartment are placed the flexors of the elbow-joint, and in the back compartment the great extensor muscle.

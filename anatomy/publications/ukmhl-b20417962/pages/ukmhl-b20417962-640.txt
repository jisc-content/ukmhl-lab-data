566 THE ARTERIES (3) THE INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY The internal iliac artery arises at the bifurcation of the common iliac opposite the lumbo-sacral articulation. It descends into the pelvis for about an inch and a quarter (3 cm.), and then divides, opposite the upper margin of the great sacro- sciatic foramen, into an anterior and a posterior branch.

Walsham in the Museum of St. Bartholomew's Hospital.) The bladder is hooked over to expose back of pelvis.

In front it is covered by the peritoneum, and is crossed by the ureter. In the adult the internal iliac is smaller than the external iliac; but in the foetus the internal is much larger than the external, and is, together with its anterior branch, the vessel by which the blood is returned to the placenta.

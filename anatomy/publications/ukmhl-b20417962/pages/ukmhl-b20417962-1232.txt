1152 SURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY To trace the synovial membrane of the shoulder-joint is a comparatively simple matter (fig. 715). Covering both aspects of the free edge of the glenoid ligament, it lines the inner aspect of the capsule whereby it reaches the articular Fig. 714.—Section through the Middle of the Right Upper Arm. (Heath.) margin of the head of the humerus; there is a distinct reflection, below, from the capsule on to the humeral neck before the rim of the cartilage is reached. An extensive protrusion of synovial membrane takes place in the form of a synovial bursa, at the inner and anterior part of the capsule, near the root of the coracoid Fig. 715.—Diagrammatic Section of Shoulder through Bicipital Groove. (Anderson.) process under the tendon of the subscapularis. Another protrusion takes place between the two tuberosities along the bicipital groove, as low as the insertion of the pectoralis major. A third synovial protrusion may be seen, but not frequently, at the outer or posterior aspect, in the form of a bursa, under the infraspinatus

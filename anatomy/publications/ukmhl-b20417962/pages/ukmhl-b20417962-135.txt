87 THE TEETH The incisors.—The central maxillary incisor is very much larger than the lateral, the crown is somewhat oblong in outline, its length exceeding the breadth. The median is longer than the distal border. The labial surface is convex, the lingual concave, and terminates near the gum in a low eminence, the basal ridge or cingulum. In recently erupted teeth, the cutting edge is elevated into three small cusps; these soon wear down and leave a straight edge. The root is long, single, and flattened laterally. The maxillary lateral incisors are much smaller than the centrals, which they Fig. 93.—The Teeth of an Adult, incisors canine bicuspids molars wisdom tooth resemble in the general contour of the crown. The distal angle of the crown is more rounded than in the central incisors, and the cingulum is more pronounced. The root is single. The maxillary incisors are lodged in the premaxilla. The mandibular central incisors are much narrower than those of the upper set, and less than half their width in the cutting edges, and the crown becomes contracted towards the neck. The cingulum is scarcely marked, and the root single. The lower lateral incisors are distinctly larger than the lower centrals in every direction. Fig. 94.—A Molar Tooth in section, and a Canine Tooth. The distal angle of the crown is rounded off; the root is single and frequently presents on each side a longitudinal groove. The canines.—These differ from the incisors in possessing larger crowns, and thick long roots. The crown ends in a blunt point, and the cutting edge slopes away on each side. The slope towards the bicuspid is the longer, and causes the crown to be asymmetrical. The lingual surface presents a median and two lateral ridges; they converge towards the well-marked cingulum, which is often produced into a distinct cusp.

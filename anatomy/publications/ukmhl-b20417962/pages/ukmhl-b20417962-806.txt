726 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM the decussation of the pyramids (fig. 438) large bundles of fibres pass from the lateral columns of the cord to cross over to the opposite side and appear in the j anterior column of the medulla, forming the greater part of the pyramids. These { bundles of fibres cut through the necks of the anterior horns so as to completely amputate the heads of the horns. A little higher up each head is thrust into a more lateral position by the increased size of the pyramids, and forms the nucleus lateralis and the nucleus ambiguus (fig. 432). The motor nuclei of the portion of the eleventh which arises in the medulla, and of the tenth and ninth nerves, are I regarded as derivatives from the head of the anterior horn, and the series is con- I tinued upwards by the nucleus of the seventh (at the junction of the pons and medulla), and in the pons by the motor nucleus of the trigeminal. A little above the decussation of the pyramids, bundles of fibres, chiefly from the funiculi 1 gracilis and cuneatus, pass forwards and cut through the neck of the posterior horn, j and then decussate, forming the sensory or upper pyramidal decussation (decus- satio lemnisci). The separated head of the posterior horn (substantia gelatinosa Rolandi) is continued upwards as far as the accessory sensory nucleus of the fifth nerve. This substantia gelatinosa is one of the sensory nuclei of the fifth nerve, j and is covered externally by a band of white fibres, concave inwards, the ascend- | ing root of the trigeminal nerve (fig. 432). At one point the substantia gelatinosa approaches very near the surface, and forms the grey tubercle of Rolando.

It can easily be seen with the unaided eye in cross-sections of the medulla. It presents a marked resemblance, in miniature, to the corpus dentatum of the cerebellum, and is often called the corpus dentatum of the olivary body. It presents an opening or hilum which opens downwards and inwards. The nucleus of the clava and the nucleus cuneatus are not directly represented in the cord, but their connection with the posterior horns can be seen in sections through the lower part of the medulla; they have probably the same anatomical value as a column of nerve-cells (Clarke's column) in the dorsal region of the spinal cord I (Testut). Other nuclei of smaller size are found in the medulla; the nucleus arci- formis and the accessory olives will serve as examples of these (fig. 432). None of these smaller nuclei are visible to the unaided eye. Specific Gravity and Weight of the Brain The average specific gravity of the brain is about 1036. The white matter is somewhat more heavy (sp. gr. 1040) than the grey matter (sp. gr. 1034).

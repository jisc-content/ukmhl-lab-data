140 THE SKELETON this surface forms the posterior boundary of the obturator foramen. The inner surface of the ischium gives origin to the obturator internus. The posterior surface of the ischium lies between the posterior rim of the acetabulum and the greater sciatic notch. Inferiorly this surface is limited by the obturator groove, which receives the posterior fleshy border of the obturator externus when the thigh is flexed. The capsule of the hip-joint is attached to the outer part of the posterior surface. The pyrij'ormis, the greater and lesser sciatic nerves, the sciatic artery, and the Fig. 151.â€”The Left Hip-bone.

The inner border assists the ilium to com- plete the greater sciatic notch, which is terminated inferiorly by the prominent ischiatic spine, which gives attachment to the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament, the levator ani, and coccygeus. From the base of the spine, posteriorly, the gemellus superior arises; and the internal pudic vessels and nerve, with the nerve to the obturator internus, cross it. The recess below the ischiatic spine is the lesser sciatic notch ; in the recent state it is covered with cartilage, and presents two, three, or four grooves for the tendinous under surface of the obturator internus muscle.

1116 SURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY inwards to the inner side of the internal ring, and thence to a point about midway between the pubes and umbilicus. Here the vessel, which at first lies between the peritoneum and fascia transversalis, perforates the latter and, passing over the fold of Douglas, enters the sheath of the rectus. It then runs upwards, closely applied to the back of that muscle, and, a little above the level of the umbilicus, divides into branches which anastomose with the epigastric or abdominal branch of the internal mammary. Lymphatics.—It is sufficiently correct to say here that those above the umbilical line go to the axillary, and those below that line to the femoral glands. Nerves.—The lower seven intercostals and the ilio-hypogastric and ilio- inguinal supply the abdominal wall. The sixth and seventh intercostals supply Fig. 686.—The Viscera as seen on fully opening the Abdomen without Disarrangement of the Internal Parts. (After Sarazin.) LIVER Falciform ligament of liver TRANSVERSE COLON CECUM BLADDER the skin over ' the pit of the stomach'; the eighth the area of the middle linea transversa; the tenth that of the umbilicus; the last thoracic, ilio-ingninal, and ilio-hypogastric, the region above Poupart's ligament, and that of the pubes. The ilio-hypogastric supplies the skin over the external ring; the ilio-inguinal that over the cord and scrotum. The last thoracic and ilio-hypogastric cross the iliac crest to supply the skin of the buttock. Viscera and visceral regions.—The general form of the abdominal space, and the relations of the several organs before they are disturbed from their normal positions; are given on pages 959 and 960. The arbitrary regions into which the abdomen is usually divided are described at the end of this article. The diaphragm.—The upper limit of the abdomen rises to the following levels: Its central tendon to about the lower end of the sternum, or the seventh chondro-

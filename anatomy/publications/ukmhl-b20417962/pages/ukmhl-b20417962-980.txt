900 THE THORAX tively in front of and behind it, and a middle mediastinum which contains the heart itself. The superior mediastinum has the following boundaries:—the manubrium with the origins of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles in front; the bodies of the four highest thoracic vertebrae behind, with the lower portions of the longus colli muscles; and on each side the pleural sacs. Above, the boundary corresponds with the superior aperture of the thorax, and below with a nearly horizontal plane passing backwards from the articulation between the manubrium and gladiolus of the sternum, to the lower part of the body of the fourth thoracic vertebra. This Fig. 522.—Superior View of a Section of the Thorax, passing through the Sternum immediately below the first costo-sternal articulation, through the trachea at its division, and through the body of the fourth thoracic vertebra.

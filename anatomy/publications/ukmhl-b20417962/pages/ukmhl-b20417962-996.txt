916 THE ORGANS OF VOICE the inferior thyroid artery, and in the lower part of its extent it is united to its fellow of the opposite side by the isthmus. Relations of the Isthmus.—The isthmus varies in breadth from a quarter to three-quarters of an inch (6 to 18 mm.). Its anterior surface is convex and it lies in relation with the deep fascia, anterior jugular veins, superficial fascia and skin. Its posterior concave surface rests upon the second, third, and fourth rings of the trachea. Its extremities are connected with the lower parts of the inner borders of the lateral lobes. Its lower border gives exit to some tributaries of the inferior thyroid veins and its upper border is in relation with the anastomosis between the Fig. 537.—View of Thyroid Body.

The pyramidal process is variable; when present it is attached by its base to the upper border of the isthmus or to the adjacent part of the left lateral lobe. It is the remains of a duct, the thyro-glossal duct, which extends in the foetus from the foramen caecum of the tongue, behind the hyoid bone, to the isthmus of the thyroid body, which is developed from its lower extremity. The capsule and suspensory ligaments.—A fibrous capsule of deep cervical fascia completely encloses the thyroid body and sends septa inwards between its

THE MUSCLES 342 Action.—Both heads will flex the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb. The outer head will flex also the earpo-metacarpal joint, while the inner head will be an adductor as well as flexor of this joint. The former will act in association with the abductor and opponens, and will draw the thumb forwards and inwards, keeping it at some distance from the palm of the hand. The latter will act with the adductor, and draw it more directly inwards in close proximity to the palm of the hand. Relations.—The outer head lies beneath the abductor pollicis, and in contact by its radial border with the opponens pollicis. The inner head is partly separated from it by the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis; upon its ulnar border it is in Fig. 284.—The Pronator Quadratus and Deep View of the Palm. :llird I \ First palmar interosseous Third dorsal interosseous Second dorsal interosseous contact with the adductor. In front of it lie the tendons of the flexor profundus with the outer lumbricales; behind, are the third part of the radial artery and the interossei muscles of the first two spaces. 4. ADDUCTOR POLLICIS The adductor pollicis, sometimes called the adductor pollicis transversus— named from its action—is a thick triangular sheet. Origin.—The front border of the shaft of the third metacarpal bone. Insertion.—(1) Tbe inner side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb; (2) the inner side of the aponeurosis of the extensor longus pollicis which covers the first phalanx. 1

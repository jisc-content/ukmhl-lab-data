CRANIUM AND SCALP 1081 in front of the ear, while from its anterior extremity the finger, carried upwards along the outline of the malar, traces the temporal ridge along the side of the skull which marks the upper limit of the temporal fossa, and the attachments of the temporal muscle and fascia. In the temporal fossa lie the muscle, and the deep temporal vessels and nerves. Above the zygoma can be felt the contraction of the temporal; and below, that of the masseter muscle; the former less distinctly owing to its covering of fascia, attached below by two layers to the upper border of the zygoma. In the zygomatic fossa, lying inside the zygoma, are the lower part of the temporal, and the two pterygoid muscles, together with the internal maxillary vessels, and the mandibular division of the fifth nerve, and their branches. The anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, and its great importance as a Fig. 659.â€”The Skull. BREGMA landmark, has already been given. The posterior inferior angle of this bone (grooved by the lateral sinus) lies a little above and behind the base of the mastoid, on a level with the roots of the zygoma (fig. 659). Just below and in front of the tip of the mastoid the transverse process of the atlas can be made out in a spare subject. The average thickness of the adult skull-cap is about one-fifth of an inch (Holden). The thickest part is at the external occipital protuberance, where the bone is often three-quarters of an inch in thickness. The thinnest part of the skull vault is over the temporal part of the squamous. The extreme fragility of the skull here is partly compensated for by the thickness of the soft parts; of these, the pericranium is alone thinner than elsewhere, while its intimate connection with the bones make cephalhematoma less frequent here (Tillaux).

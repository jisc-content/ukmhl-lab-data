The lower end of the spleen is blunt and presents a triangular area which Cun- ningham calls the basal surface. It lies against the splenic flexure of the colon and the costo-colic ligaments. The term basal applied to this extremity is due to the circumstance that the shape of the spleen in situ is that of an irregular tetra- hedron with its base below (Cunningham). The spleen is set obliquely in the body. Its long axis about corresponds to the line of the tenth rib. In size it varies, owing to the fact that it increases in dimensions after food and under other circumstances. In the adult it measures generally about five to Fig. 591.â€”View of the Spleen, etc., from behind. (Riidinger.) LUNG Diaphragm STOMACH DESCENDING COLON six inches in length, three or four inches in breadth, and one to one and a half inches in thickness; its usual volume, according to Krause, is from nine and three- quarters to fifteen cubic inches. Its average weight is one hundred and seventy grammes. It is entirely surrounded by peritoneum except at the hilum. On either side of the hilum the gastro-splenic ligament is attached. This reflexion of peritoneum, sometimes called the gastro-splenic omentum, passes inwards to the left extremity of the stomach and the left margin of the great omentum. A fold of peritoneum, the phreno-splenic ligament, connects the upper end of the spleen to the dia- phragm. The reflection of peritoneum from the spleen to the left kidney is called the lieno-renal ligament.

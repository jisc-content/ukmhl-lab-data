THE CARPUS 131 surface has a conspicuous facet for the pisiform bone near the inner extremity, and the dorsal surface is rough for ligaments. Articulations.—Pisiform, semilunar, and unciform. Fig. 136.—The Left Scaphoid. TUBEROSITY Fig. 137.—The Left Semilunar. The Pisiform The pisiform resembles closely a split pea. Its dorsal aspect, corresponding to the cut surface of the pea, articulates with the facet on the palmar surface of the cuneiform. The rest of this bone is rough for the anterior annular ligament and the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris. Fig. 138.—The Left Cuneiform. for semilunar for pisiform Fig. 139.—The Left Pisiform. FOR CUNEIFORM The Trapezium The trapezium is the first bone of the distal row; it is very irregular in shape. The inferior surface is saddle-shaped, and articulates with the base of the first Fig. 140.—The Left Trapezium. ■the ridge FOR SECONO METACARPAL GROOVE FOR FLEXOR CARPI RADIALIS FOR FIRST METACARPAL metacarpal bone. The superior surface has a facet for the scaphoid. The inner (ulnar) surface has two facets; the lower and smaller is for the base of the second

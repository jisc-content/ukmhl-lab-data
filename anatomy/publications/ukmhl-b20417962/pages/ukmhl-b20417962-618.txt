544 THE ARTERIES longus pollicis. Opposite the metacarpophalangeal joint it usually divides into two branches, one of which is distributed to each side of the thumb on its palmar aspect. These vessels anastomose with each other at the end of the thumb, like the other collateral digital arteries. (2) The radialis indicis comes off from the radial artery a little lower than the former vessel, or as a common trunk with it, and passes forwards between the abductor indicis and adductor transversus pollicis, parallel to the radial side of the Fig. 359.â€”Anastomoses and Distribution of the Arteries of the Hand.

After emerging from beneath the adductor transversus pollicis, it continues its course along the radial side of the index finger, on its palmar aspect, as far as the tip, anastomosing in this course with the collateral digital artery on the opposite side of the finger in a way similar to that of the other collateral digital arteries. It frequently communicates, at the lower border of the adductor pollicis, with the superficial palmar arch and princeps pollicis. It gives off a dorsal branch, which anastomoses with the dorsalis indicis. (3) The palmar interosseous arteries, three in number, come off from the

204 THE ARTICULATIONS of the spine and the ligaments, which fasten the sacrum to the ilium, *are sufficient to check its upward displacement. The anterior and downward displacements of the sacrum are prevented by the interosseous and posterior sacro-sciatic ligaments, which pass from the ilia to the sacrum, and suspend the latter, acting somewhat in the same manner as the chains of a suspension bridge. They also bind the two bones more tightly together: the greater the pressure, the tighter the union. The suspension bridge arrangement of the sacro-iliac synchondrosis is admirably adapted to give strength to the pelvis. (6) The Sacro-coccygeal Articulation Class.—Amphiarthrosis. The last piece of the sacrum and first piece of the coccyx enter into this union, 'and are bound together by the following ligaments:— Anterior sacro-coccygeal. Supracornual. Posterior sacro-coccygeal. Intertransverse. Intervertebral substance. The intervertebral substance is a small oval disc, three-quarters of an inch (about 2 cm.) wide, and a little less from before backwards, closely connected with the surrounding ligaments. It resembles the other discs in structure, but is softer and more jelly-like, though the laminae of the fibrous portion are well marked. Fig. 209.—Ligaments connecting Sacrum and Coccyx posteeioely. The anterior sacro-coccygeal ligament is a prolongation of the glistening fibrous structure on the front of the sacrum. It is really the lower extremity of the anterior common ligament, which is thicker over this joint than over the central part of either of the bones.

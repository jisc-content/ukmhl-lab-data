260 THE ARTICULATIONS branch of the external circumflex; the anterior recurrent branch from the anterior tibial; and the posterior tibial recurrent. The nerve-supply comes from the great sciatic, anterior crural, and obturator sources. The great sciatic gives off the internal and external popliteal; the internal popliteal sends two, sometimes three branches—one with the azygos artery; one with the inferior internal, and sometimes one with the superior internal articular artery; the external popliteal gives a branch which accompanies the superior, and another which accompanies the inferior articular artery, and a recurrent branch Fig. 249.—Vertical Section of the Knee-joint in the Antero-posterior Direction.

The anterior crural sends an articular branch from the nerve to the vastus externus; a second from the nerve to the vastus internus; and sometimes a third from that to the crureus. Thus there are three articular twigs to the knee derived from the muscular branches of the anterior crural. (Roger Williams, Journ. Anat. Physiol., 1879.) The obturator by its deep division sends a branch through the adductor magnus on to the popliteal artery, which enters the joint through the posterior ligament. The movements which occur at the knee-joint are flexion and extension, with

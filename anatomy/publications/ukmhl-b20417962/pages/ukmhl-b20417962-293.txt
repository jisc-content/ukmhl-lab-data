239 THE CARPAL JOINTS unciform, has somewhat the character of a condyloid joint, the os magnum and unciform being the condyle, to fit into the cavity formed by the scaphoid, semi- lunar, and cuneiform; the other portions are typically arthrodial. The ligaments are: (1) anterior medio-carpal; (2) posterior medio-carpal; (3) transverse dorsal. The anterior or palmar medio-carpal is a ligament of considerable strength, consisting mostly of fibres which radiate from the magnum to the scaphoid, semi- lunar, and cuneiform; some few fibres connect the trapezoid and trapezium with Fig. 235.â€”Synovial Membranes of Weist, Hand, and Fingers. the scaphoid, and others pass between the unciform and cuneiform. It is covered over and thickened by fibrous tissue derived from the sheaths of the flexor tendons and the fibres of origin of the small muscles of the thumb and little finger. The posterior or dorsal medio-carpal ligament consists of fibres passing obliquely from the bones of the first row to those of the second. It is stronger on the ulnar side than on the radial, but is not so strong as the palmar ligament. The transverse dorsal ligament (fig. 234) is an additional band, well marked and often of considerable strength, which passes across the head of the magnum

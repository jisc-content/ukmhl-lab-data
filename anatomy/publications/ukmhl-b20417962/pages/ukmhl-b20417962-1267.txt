1187 POPLITEAL SPACE descends, as a rounded cord, to cross the neck of the fibula and enter the peroneus longus. In tenotomy of the biceps, the knife should be introduced between the nerve and the tendon, and made to cut from within outwards, and thus away from the nerve. On the inner side the tendons are thus arranged: Nearest to the middle of the popliteal space is the long and more slender tendon of the semi-tendmosus; next, the thicker tendon of the semi-membranosus; this and the gracilis, which comes next, appear as one tendon, but by a little manipulation the finger can be made to sink into the interval between the semi-membranosus. with its thick Fig. 752.—Side Yijew of the Popliteal Aeteet. (From a dissection in the Hunterian Museum.) rounded border externally and the gracilis internally. The sartorius can easily be thrown into relief on the inner side of the joint by telling the patient to cross one leg. Popliteal vessels.—The artery traverses this space from above downwards, appearing beneath the semi-membranosus, a little to the inner side of the middle line, and then passing down in the centre of the space to the interval between the gastrocnemii. Its course corresponds with a line drawn from the inner side of the hamstrings to the centre of the lower part of the space. The artery bifurcates on the level of a line corresponding to the tubercle of the tibia. It lies on the popliteal surface of the femur, the posterior ligament, and the popliteus. It is the second

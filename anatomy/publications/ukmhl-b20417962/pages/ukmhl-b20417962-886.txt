806 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM (6) The anterior crural nerve is the largest branch of the lumbar plexus. It arises by three roots, which spring from the second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves; these roots traverse the substance of the psoas and unite into a single trunk in the deep groove between the psoas and iliacus muscles. The nerve then passes under cover of the fascia iliaca, behind Poupart's ligament, into Scarpa's triangle, where it lies external to the femoral sheath and divides into two groups of terminal branches—the superficial and deep. In the abdominal part of its course the anterior crural nerve gives branches to the iliacus, and a twig to the femoral artery. Fig. 463.—Anterior Crural and Obturator Nerves. (Ellis.)

The muscular branches of the superficial series contain fibres from the second and third lumbar nerves; they are two in number—one to the pectineus, which passes behind the femoral sheath to the anterior surface of the pectineus muscle, and one to the sartorius. The latter usually accompanies one of the two divisions of the middle cutaneous nerve. The cutaneous branches of the superficial series are the internal and middle;

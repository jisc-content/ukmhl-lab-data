THE SKELETON 130 deeply concave for the head of the magnum. The ulnar ridge of the infei'ior artic- ular surface is faceted for the unciform. The outer (radial) surface has a narrow semilunar facet for the scaphoid, whilst the inner (ulnar) aspect of the bone pre- sents a quadrilateral facet for the base of the cuneiform. The palmar and dorsal surfaces are rough and non-articular. Articulations.â€”-With the radius, scaphoid, cuneiform, magnum, and unciform. The Cuneiform The cuneiform (or pyramidal bone) rests by its base on the ulnar side of the semilunar; its apex is directed downwards and to the ulnar side, and serves for the attachment of the internal lateral ligament of the wrist. The base presents a facet for the semilunar. The inferior surface has a sinuous articular surface for the unciform bone. The superior surface has a convex smooth portion, where it plays upon the interarticular cartilage which intervenes between it and the lower end of the ulna; the remainder of this surface is rough for ligaments. The palmar

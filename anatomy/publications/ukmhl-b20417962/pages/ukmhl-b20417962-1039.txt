959 THE ABDOMEN The subperitoneal segment of the tissue they divide into two portions: a parietal layer, closely connected to the wall of the cavity, and visceral lamina which accom- pany the branches of the aorta to their distribution. The parietal layer is developed chiefly in front of the vertebral column, ' from which point it may be traced as a broad expansion between, and intimately con- nected with, the peritoneum on the one hand, and the transversalis, diaphragmatic, iliac, obturator, and recto-vesical fascia? on the other.' It forms a sheath for the large vessels, and is continuous with the vessels outside the abdomen. The visceral portion follows the course of the branches of the aorta, and greatly assists in fixing certain viscera, such as the liver, pancreas, etc., becoming continu- ous with their connective-tissue tunic. This tissue can be seen passing between the layers of peritoneum to those organs which are connected to the abdominal wall by duplicatures of peritoneum. For an account of the evolution of the peritoneum, and an explanation of its arrangement in the human body, the student is referred to page 991.

GREAT OMENTUM SMALL INTESTINE THE ABDOMEN The abdomen properly consists of that part of the body cavity situated between the diaphragm and the pelvis. It is bounded above by the diaphragm; below, by the brim of the true pelvis; behind, by the vertebral column, diaphragm, quadratus lumborum and psoas muscles, and by the posterior portions of the ilia. At the sides it is limited by the anterior parts of the ilia and the hinder segments of the muscles which compose the anterior abdominal wall, viz., the transversalis, inter-

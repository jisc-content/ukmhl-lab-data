THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION 974 piece of the sacrum. The sigmoid meso-colon measures from one and a quarter to three and a half inches in width—i. e., from the parietes to the bowel. When a descending meso-colon exists it joins that of the loop, and the line of attachment is then, as a rule, directed obliquely across the psoas and the lower end of the kidney, while beyond the pelvic brim the attachment is as above described. There is often no meso-colon over the psoas, the gut being adherent to that muscle. Fig. 577.—View of the Deeper Abdominal Viscera. (RUdinger.) Superior vena cava — THORACIC DUCT Inferior vena cava PANCREAS KIDNEY ASCENDING COLON In connection with the sigmoid meso-colon is often found a fossa or pouch of peritoneum, known as the intersigmoid fossa. The pouch is formed by the layers of the meso-colon, and is produced by the sigmoid artery. It is generally found over the bifurcation of the iliac vessels. The pouch is funnel-shaped, and the opening looks downwards and to the left. The fossa varies in depth from one to one and a half inches, and is the seat of the sigmoid hernia. The rectum.—The rectum has been described as divided into three portions. Such division is quite arbitrary, and is inconvenient. What is usually described as the first portion has, in the account just given, been included with the sigmoid flexure.

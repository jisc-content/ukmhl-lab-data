1002 THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION In man and in most of the higher mammals not only is the meso-gaster (m-g, fig. 602, A) involved in the bulging which forms the great omentum, but some part of the transverse meso-colon (m-c) becomes involved also. This depends upon the close connection which exists between the right end of the transverse colon and the duodenum. It will be seen from figs. 600 and 602, A, that but a little extension of the bulging of the membrane is needed for the transverse meso-colon to become involved. In such case the anterior layer of the great omentum will Fig. 603.—Relation of Great Omentum to Transverse Colon. appear to come off from the greater curvature of the stomach, while the posterior layer will return to the transverse colon and will become continuous with the meso-colon (figs. 602, C, and 603, A). In the adult man this arrangement usually extends throughout the greater part of the width of the great omentum. It is in all instances to be observed in all that part of the great omentum which is about and to the right of the middle line. In the foetus (as in the lower primates) the posterior layer of that part of the great omentum which is quite to the left of the Fig. 604.—Transverse Section of the Abdomen at the Level of the Foramen of Winslow. middle line is clear of the transverse meso-colon, and is obviously derived from the meso-gaster solely (figs. 602, B, and 603, B). This difference between the right and the left extremities of the transverse meso-colon and omentum can sometimes be made out in the adult man. The term ' the lesser cavity of the peritoneum' is applied to the cavity formed by this protrusion of the peritoneum. The term is of use for descriptive purposes, but it is apt to be misleading if it favors the impression that the general sac of the peritoneum is divided into two perfectly distinct parts.

736 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM The two sulci are placed dorso-laterally (fig. 438) and the posterior nerve-roots emerge from them. They serve to divide each half of the cord into a posterior and an antero-lateral area or column (fig. 439). The anterior nerve-roots emerge from the antero-lateral aspects of the cord, not from grooves or sulci, hut in a relatively scattered manner. They divide the antero- lateral columns into anterior and lateral portions (fig. 439). The three septa lie in the dorsal part of the cord; they are a median and two Fig. 439.â€”Sections through Different Regions of the Spinal Cord. (After Schwalbe.)

It consists of neuroglial tissue containing branches of the posterior spinal vessels, and it passes from the pia mater to the posterior, or grey, commissure. The postero-lateral septa are only seen in the dorsal and cervical regions. They extend from the pia mater into the posterior column, dividing it into postero-median and postero- lateral parts.

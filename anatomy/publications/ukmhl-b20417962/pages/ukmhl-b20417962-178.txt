126 THE SKELETON THE RADIUS The radius is shorter than the ulna and lies parallel with it. The upper end, or head, is surmounted by a circular disc, of which the superior surface is depressed for the reception of the capitellum of the humerus, especially in flexion of the fore- arm. The margin of the head is also articular; it is deeper on the ulnar aspect, where it is received by the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna; the rest of the circum- Fig. 131.—Aeticulae Facets on the Lowee End of Left Eadius and Ulna.

Below the cartilage-covered surface of the bone there is a constricted portion, or neck, which is in relation by its outer side with the supinator brevis. Beneath the neck, on the antero-internal aspect of the bone, there is an oval eminence, the bicipital tuberosity, divided longitudinally into a rough posterior portion for the biceps tendon, and a smooth anterior surface in relation with the bursa which is situated between the tendon and the tuberosity. The radius has three borders and three surfaces. Of the three borders, the Fig. 132.—Posteeioe View of the Lowee End of the Radius and Ulna. interosseous is the best marked. Commencing at the posterior edge of the bicipital tuberosity, it extends as a sharp ridge until it approaches the distal ex- tremity of the bone; it then divides to become continuous with the anterior and posterior margins of the sigmoid cavity. It affords attachment to the interosseous membrane. The anterior border starts from the bicipital tuberosity, crosses obliquely to the outer side of the bone, and descends to the anterior border of the styloid process. The upper third of this border is called the oblique line, and limits the insertion of the supinator brevis and the origin of the flexor longus pollieis,

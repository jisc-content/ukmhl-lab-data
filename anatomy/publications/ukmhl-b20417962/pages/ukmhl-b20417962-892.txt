(b) The long pudendal nerve, or nerve of Soemmerring, winds round the origin of the hamstring muscles, just below the ischial tuberosity, giving twigs to the integument on the inner and upper part of the thigh, and then curves upwards and forwards towards the external genitals. Having pierced Colles's fascia, it communicates with the superficial jjerinseal nerves, and ends in the integument of Fig. 466.—A Dissection of the Lumbar and Sacral Plexuses, from behind.

In the female it is distributed in a similar manner to the labium majus. 7. The nerve to the obturator internus arises from the front of the plexus from the fifth lumbar and the first and second sacral nerves. It passes through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, below the pyriformis, and crosses the base of the ischial spine, being placed on the outer side of the pudic vessels. Having furnished a twig to the superior gemellus, it enters the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen', and ends in the obturator internus. 8. The perforating cutaneous nerve rises from the second and third sacral nerves. It runs in the angular interval between the great and lesser sacro-sciatic

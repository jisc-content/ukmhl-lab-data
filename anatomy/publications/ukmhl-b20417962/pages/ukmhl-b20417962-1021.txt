941 THE FCETAL HEART The blood of the superior vena cava passes from the right auricle into the right ventricle, and thence through the pulmonary artery (a small portion only reaching the lungs) and ductus arteriosus to the descending aorta. Through this trunk it is conducted to the lower half of the body as well as to the placenta through the umbilical arteries. From these parts it is returned to the right auricle by the inferior cava, which also receives the blood returning from the placenta as already described. The current which passes through the inferior cava only in a slight degree mingles with tha,t of the superior cava, as it is guided directly through the foramen ovale by means of the Eustachian valve into the left auricle. This cavity also receives a small quantity of blood (which has traversed the lungs) through the pulmonary veins. From the left auricle the blood current passes into the left ventricle, and thence through the aorta to the head and neck and the upper extremities.

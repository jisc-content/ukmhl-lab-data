902 THE ORGANS OF VOICE separated behind. They include between them an angle varying from 80° to 90°, and are somewhat obliquely inclined, their outer surfaces looking slightly downwards as well as outwards. Each plate has an outer and an inner surface and four borders. The upper and lower posterior angles of each plate project upwards and down- wards to form its superior and inferior cornua. The outer surface is smooth, and is crossed by an oblique and often very faintly defined line, or by an occasional fibrous band. This is marked at each extremity by a small tubercle. These tubercles are more pronounced in old subjects. The line and the adjacent cartilage give attachments to the thyro-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscles, and the inferior constrictor which overlaps the smaller portion of the ala lying behind the line. The inner surface is also smooth; it is concave, and in contact with the mucous membrane which lines the sinus pyriformis, with branches of the laryngeal nerves and vessels, and with the external thyro-arytenoid and lateral crico-arytenoid muscles. The anterior or isthmic border, which is also the shortest, corresponds to the junction of the two alas in the median line in front; very prominent above, where it forms the pomum Adami, it becomes depressed before again projecting less markedly below. Posteriorly, at the angle of junction it gives attachment to the stalk of the epiglottis, the true and false vocal cords, the thyro-arytenoid and thyro- epiglottidei muscles. The superior border, which gives attachment to the thyro-hyoid membrane, is sinuous. Slightly depressed posteriorly, it rises in front, and then becomes abruptly scooped out and everted to form the side of the great median notch. The inferior border is somewhat sinuous. It gives attachment in front to the middle portion of the crico-thyroid membrane, and behind to the crico-thyroid muscle, and presents the small tubercle already noticed at the termination of the oblique line.

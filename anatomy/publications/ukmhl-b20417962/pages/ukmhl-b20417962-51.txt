9 EXCEPTIONAL CERVICAL VERTEBRAE The Axis or Second Cervical Vertebra The Axis is easily recognised by the large rounded odontoid process which sur- mounts its upper surface. The centrum has a more prominent lip than the other cervical vertebras, and the anterior surface has a median ridge separating two lateral depressions. The odontoid process is an irregularly rounded peg of bone. The anterior surface has an oval facet for the anterior arch of the atlas. Posteriorly it presents a deeply cut smooth groove for the transverse ligament. To the apex, a thin narrow fibrous band (the suspensory ligament) is attached. On each side of the apex there is an oblique facet for the check ligaments which connect it with the occipital bone. The pedicles are stout and broad; they support the oval, upwardly directed, articular surfaces for the atlas. The inferior articular surfaces do not differ from the cervical type. The transverse are smaller than the costal processes. The spinous process is stout and strong, deeply concave on its under aspect, and affords firm attachment for muscles, especially those which help to rotate the head. The Seventh Cervical Vertebra This vertebra has a longer spinous process than any other cervical vertebra, hence it is sometimes called vertebra prominens. The extremity of this process

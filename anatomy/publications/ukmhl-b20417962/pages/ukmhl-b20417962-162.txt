THE SKELETON 112 scapula. The second facet is broader, and gives attachment to the teres major muscle. In bones from a muscular subject the third facet, quite at the inferior angle, is for a few fibres of the latissimus dorsi. The spine commences at the posterior border of the scapula by a broad trian- gular surface; it then crosses the dorsal surface obliquely to the glenoid fossa, becoming more prominent as it passes outwards till it reaches the neck of the scapula; from this point it forms the overhanging acromion process. The spine presents a superior surface which gives origin to the supra-spinatus muscle, and an inferior surface which affords origin to the infraspinatus muscle. It has a promi- nent crest, which is continuous posteriorly with the vertebral border, and, at its commencement, is smooth for a bursa between it and the trapezius. The crest is subcutaneous, and presents two lipsâ€”a superior for the insertion of the trapezius, and an inferior lip for the origin of the deltoid. The crest is continued into the acromion process. The acromion process forms the summit of the shoulder, and presents two surfaces, two borders, and a tip. The upper surface affords origin at its posterior part to a portion of the deltoid. The under surface is concave and smooth. Its inner border, a continuation of the superior lip of the crest, receives the trapezius, and presents near the tip a small articular facet for the outer end of the clavicle; the edges of the facet are rough for the acromio-clavicular ligaments. The outer

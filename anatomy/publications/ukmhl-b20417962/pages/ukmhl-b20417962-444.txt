THE MUSCLES 380 tubercle of the caleaneum and the adjacent portion of the under surface of that hone in front of the great tubercle; (2) the upper surface of the back part of the outer division of the plantar fascia; (3) the outer surface of the back part of the external intermuscular septum; (4) the long plantar ligament and other ligamen- tous structures lying upon the outer border of the sole, and more especially an aponeurotic band which runs from the outer side of the lesser tubercle of the cal- eaneum to the outer side of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, and of the base of the first phalanx of the fifth toe. Insertion.—(1) The outer part of the under surface of the base of the first phalanx of the little toe; (2) usually also the outer part of the under surface of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone; (3) the outer edge of the fourth tendon Fig. 294.—Second Layer of the Muscles of the Sole. of the extensor longus digitorum upon the back of the first phalanx of the little toe. Structure.—The muscle, which is at first encased in the aponeuroses, from which as well as from the bone it takes origin, converges from both sides upon a tendon which is first visible on its under surface at the front of the caleaneum. A small portion of its outer part is now inserted into the tubercle of the fifth meta- tarsal bone, internal to the strong aponeurotic band which is also here attached. From this point the tendon of insertion is free on its inner side, but receives fleshy fibres still from the continuation of the aponeurotic band just mentioned, until it is inserted into the base of the first phalanx. Nerve-supply.—From the external plantar division of the posterior tibial

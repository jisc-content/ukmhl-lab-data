936 THE ORGANS OF CIRCULATION tricular wall in the adult is much thinner than the left, being thickest at the base, and thinnest at the apex. The left ventricular wall is about double the thickness of the right; and it is thickest where the ventricle is broadest, being thinner both at its base and apex. The Vessels and Nerves The arteries.â€”The two coronary arteries, right and left, arise, the right from the anterior, and the left from the left posterior sinus of Valsalva just above the free borders of the right, and of the left posterior semilunar valves. The right coronary artery passes forwards between the pulmonary artery and the right auricular appendix, and then winds to the right border of the heart, around which it turns to gain its posterior surface. In this course it lies in the auriculo- ventricular groove. At the commencement of the posterior interventricular groove it divides into its two main branches, one of which, still passing onwards in the auriculo-ventricular groove, anastomoses with the left coronary, whilst the other (interventricular) descends in the furrow between the ventricles towards the apex, near which it anastomoses with branches derived from the left coronary artery which have reached the posterior surface of the heart after passing around its apex. In this course the right coronary artery supplies branches to the right auricle (auricular) and roots of the pulmonary artery and aorta, as well as one that descends near the right border of the heart (right marginal), and a second (preventricular) to the anterior wall of the right ventricle. It supplies both ventricles and the septum. The left coronary artery passes for a short distance forwards, between the pulmonary artery and the left auricular appendix, and then divides into two prin- cipal branches, one of which descends in the interventricular groove to the apex of

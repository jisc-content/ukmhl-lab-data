142 THE SKELETON extemus. To its inner surface the crus penis is attached; it also gives origin to the transversus perinei, the erector penis, and the obturator internus. The pubes consists of a body and two rami. The body, quadrilateral in shape, is continuous with the ramus of the ischium by means of a flattened process termed the descending ramus. The outer surface of the body gives origin to the adductor Fig. 153.—An Immature Innominate Bone, showing a Cotyloid Bone. THE COTYLOID BONE longus. The adductor brevis, the gracilis, and the obturator extemus arise from the outer surface of the body and descending ramus. A small portion of the adductor magnus also arises from the descending ramus. The posterior surface of the body and that of the descending ramus is continuous with the corresponding surface of the ramus of the ischium, and affords attachment to the levator ani and obturator Fig. 154.—The Pelvis of a Fcettjs at Bieth, to show the Three Portions op the Innominate Bones. internus. The posterior surface of the descending ramus gives origin to the com- pressor urethrse and a part of the erector penis, the crus penis, and the^ obturator internus. The inner border is rough and covered with fibro-cartilage, which unites it with the opposite bone to form the pubic symphysis. The outer border forms part of the obturator foramen. The inner border of the descending ramus forms with the ramus of the ischium the pubic arch.

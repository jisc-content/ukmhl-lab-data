144 THE SKELETON Blood-supply.—The ilium receives on its anterior surface, twigs from the ilio- lumbar, deep circumflex iliac, and obturator arteries. On the dorsum, arteries enter it from the gluteal and sciatic trunks. The ischium is supplied by the obturator, internal, and external circumflex. Fig. 155.—Hip-bone, showing Secondary Centres.

The pubes receives twigs from the obturator, internal and external circumflex, deep epigastric, and the pubic branches of the common femoral artery. Development.—The cartilaginous representative of the hip-bone consists at first of an ilio-ischiatic and a pubic segment. These quickly fuse and form a continuous plate. (Rosenberg. ) Early in the second month a nucleus appears above the acetab- ulum for the ilium, and one appears a little later below the cavity for the ischium.

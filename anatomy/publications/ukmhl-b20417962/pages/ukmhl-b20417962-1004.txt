924 THE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION bronchus is placed next, and the upper vein is again the lowest. From before backwards on both sides, the arrangement is—upper vein, artery, and bronchus. The weight of the lungs together is about forty-two ounces; the right lung is about two ounces heavier than the left. In color the lungs are of a pinkish white; but they become darker, mottled, and even black, as age advances. Structure.—The lungs possess an external serous coat derived from the pleura, beneath which is a delicate subserous layer. The parenchyma, or lung substance, is composed of minute lobules con- Fig. 545.—Anterior View of the Lungs: Pericardium. (Modified from Bourgery.) ENSIFORM CARTILAGE nected by interlobular areolar tissue. Each lobule is made up of a ramification of a bronchial tube with its cluster of terminal air cells, with a minute plexus of pulmonary and bronchial vessels, nerves, and lymphatics. The vessels.—The pulmonary arteries convey venous blood from the heart to the lungs; they divide into branches which follow the bronchial tubes, and finally terminate in a flat meshwork upon the walls of the intercellular passages and air cells. The radicles of the pulmonary veins start from this network; they coalesce into larger branches which accompany the arteries and terminate in two large ves- sels on each side, which return the arterial blood to the left auricle of the heart.

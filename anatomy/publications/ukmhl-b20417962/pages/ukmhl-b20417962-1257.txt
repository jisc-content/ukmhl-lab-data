1177 THE THIGH limb. According to Mr. Treves, a few of the superficial genital lymphatics, and all those from the perinseum, go into the vertical group. Saphenous opening.—-The depression corresponding to this is placed just below Gimbernat's ligament, with which its upper extremity blends. Its centre is about an inch and a half (37 mm.) below and also external to a line dropped ver- tically from the pubic spine. This and the other structures concerned in femoral hernia are fully described under this section (vide supra, page 1138). Line of femoral artery.—A line drawn from the mid-point between the Fig. 743.—Anterior Crural and Obturator Nerves. (Ellis.) Femoral vein Femoral artery anterior superior spine and the symphysis pubis to the adductor tubercle will correspond with the course of this vessel. The sartorius usually crosses it, three to four inches (100 mm.) below Poupart's ligament. The profunda artery arises an inch and a half to two inches below Poupart's ligament. Therefore the incision for tying the femoral in Scarpa's triangle should be about three inches long, in the line of the artery, and begin about three inches below Poupart's ligament, and run over the apex of the triangle. The vein lies, below Poupart's ligament, imme- diately to the inner side of the artery. From this point the vein gets on to a some- what deeper plane, though still very close to the artery, and gradually inclining back-

THE PULMONARY 463 In the foetus, the pulmonary artery (fig. 318) continues its course upwards, backwards, and to the left, under the name of the ductus arteriosus, or ductus Botalli, and opens into the descending aorta just below the origin of the left subclavian artery. After birth, that portion of the pulmonary artery which extends to the aorta becomes obliterated, and remains merely as a fibrous cord. The trunk of the artery with the ductus Botalli was originally the left fifth aortic arch, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve in early foetal life passed below it direct to the larynx. As in the process of development the heart descends into the thorax, and the fifth arch assumes a more vertical direction, it comes to j:>ass that the nerve winds round the transverse portion of the aorta, the fourth aortic arch, Fig. 317.—Anterior View of the Heart with the Large Arteries and Veins. (By permission. Royal College of Surgeons Museum.) Left common carotid artery Internal jugular vein and consequently external to the ductus arteriosus (fig. 321). In adult life the cord formed by the obliterated ductus arteriosus arises a little to the left of the bifurca- tion of the pulmonary artery, and receives a slight reflexion from the pericardium as it pierces that membrane. It occasionally remains partially unobliterated. Relations.—In front, the trunk of the pulmonary artery is covered by the second bone of the sternum, the remains of the thymus gland, and the pericardium (fig. 319), and at its commencement lies immediately behind the anterior extremity of the second intercostal space, the left lung and pleura intervening. Behind, it lies successively upon the ascending part of the arch of the aorta and the left auricle.

105 THE STERNUM clavicles. Occasionally a rounded pisiform bone is seen on each side, immediately internal to the articular notch for the clavicle; these are the episternal bones. The last sternebra, or xiphoid, is the least developed and, though calcified in old age, rarely ossifies. Its tip is directly continuous with the linea alba, and the base rives slight attachment to the rectus abdominis muscle. Fig. 113.—The Steenum. (Anterior view.)

213 OF THE STERNUM The anterior chondro-sternal ligament (fig. 217) is a triangular band of strong fibres which cover the inner half-inch of the front of the costal cartilage, and radiate upwards and downwards upon the front of the sternum. Some of the fibres decussate across the middle line with fibres of the opposite ligament. At its upper and lower borders it is in contact with the superior and inferior ligaments respectively. Fig. 217.â€”The Steenum. (Left side, showing ligaments ; right side, the synovial cavities.) The posterior chondro-sternal ligament consists of little more than a thick- ening of the fibrous envelopes of the bone and cartilage, the joint being completed behind by a continuity of perichondrium with periosteum. The superior and inferior ligaments are strong, well-marked bands, which pass from the upper and lower borders respectively of the costal cartilage to the lateral edges of the sternum. The sixth and seventh cartilages are so close

683 FISSURE OF ROLANDO The frontal operculum is the small part of the inferior frontal convolution inclosed between the ascending and the anterior horizontal limbs of the Sylvian fissure and the orbital operculum is the part of the inferior frontal convolution beneath the latter limb. The fissure of Rolando, or central sulcus, serves as a line of demarcation between the frontal and parietal lobes. It is, next to the fissure of Sylvius, the most important of the incomplete fissures of the brain. It extends from the great longitudinal fissure to the Sylvian fissure, and may communicate with the latter (19 per cent., Cunningham), but the communication is always shallow. At its upper end it usually (60 per cent,, Cunningham) passes into the great longitu- dinal fissure and appears on the mesial surface of the hemisphere, where it ends by bending backwards for about a quarter of an inch. The fissure of Rolando is directed downwards and forwards so that the fissures of the two sides taken together form an angle of about 143°, open in front, The fissure does not pursue a perfectly straight course, but is somewhat sinuous, and two of its bends, more Fig. 410.—Lateral View of the Fissuees and Convolutions of the Ceeebeum.

These genua mark off the fissure into three approximately equal parts. The superior genu is directed backwards. The inferior genu looks forwards; it is more constant and much more strongly marked than the superior genu. In rare cases the fissure of Rolando may communicate with the praecentral or intraparietal sulci, but as a rule it pursues an isolated course across the convex surface. It has been very generally taught that the fissure of Rolando is caused by the pressure of a vein which passes during foetal life (from the fourth to the sixth month) from the middle cerebral vein to the superior longitudinal sinus. This view has been recently disproved, as it has been shown that the fissure develops in two segments, an upper and a lower, and the fissure is after- wards completed by the sinking down of the central portion. The remains of this central eleva- tion can always be seen on opening the fissure of Rolando as a deeply placed annectant or bridging convolution at the level of the superior genu. (Cunningham.) The fissure of Rolando is one of the earliest of the incomplete fissures to appear, and is usually developed during the last week or ten days of the fifth month of intra-uterine life. Ry its transverse direction it interrupts the longitudinal course of the majority of the cerebral fissures ;

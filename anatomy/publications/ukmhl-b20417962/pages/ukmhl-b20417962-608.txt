536 THE ARTERIES III. Relations of the Ulnar Artery in the Palm (Superficial Palmar Arch) The ulnar artery, on entering the palm, divides into two branches, the superficial and deep. The superficial branch (fig. 354), the direct continuation of the vessel, anasto- moses with the superficial volar, a branch of the radial, forming what is then known Fig. 354.â€”Anastomoses and Distribution of the Arteries of the Hand.

After descending a short distance towards the cleft between the fourth and fifth fingers, it turns outwards towards the thumb, forming a curve with its convexity towards the fingers and its concavity towards the muscles of the thumb, and anastomoses opposite the cleft between the index and middle fingers, at the junction of the upper with the middle third of the palm, with the superficial volar branch of the radial artery to complete the arch. A line drawn across the palm on a level with the thumb at a right angle to the hand will roughly indicate the situation of the arch.

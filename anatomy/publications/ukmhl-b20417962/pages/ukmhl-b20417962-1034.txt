954 THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA By FREDERICK TREVES, F.R.C.S.,Eng. SURGEON IN ORDINARY TO H. R. H. THE DUKE OF YORK ; SURGEON TO AND LECTURER ON SURGERY AT THE LONDON HOSl'ITAL THE PERITONEUM Its general character.—The peritoneum i.s a thin and delicate serous mem- brane which lines the cavity of the abdomen from the diaphragm to the pelvic floor, and invests or covers to a varying extent the viscera which that cavity contains. Viewed in its very simplest condition, it may be regarded as a closed sac, the inner surface of which is smooth and perfectly polished, while the outer surface is rough and is attached to the tissues which surround it. Could it be possible for the peritoneum to be removed entire from the body by some process of superhuman dissection, it would appear simply as a huge thin-walled bag. In the male subject the peritoneum forms actually a closed sac; but in the Fig. 561.—Transverse Section of the Peritoneal Sac at about the Level of the Umbilicus. female its wall exhibits two minute punctures, which correspond to the openings of the Fallopian tubes. That part which lines the walls of the abdomen is termed the parietal peritoneum; that which is reflected on to the viscera is the visceral peritoneum. The disposition of the peritoneum may first be studied by noting its arrangement as made evident in transverse sections of the abdomen at certain levels. The first section to be described shows the peritoneum in its simplest condition. This is a transverse section through the body, at about the level of the upper surface of the fourth lumbar vertebra, and therefore about the site of the umbilicus (fig. 561). Starting on the inner surface of the anterior abdominal parietes, the peritoneum is seen to cover the transversalis fascia, and indirectly the anterior abdominal muscles; then, passing to the left, it lines the side of the abdomen,

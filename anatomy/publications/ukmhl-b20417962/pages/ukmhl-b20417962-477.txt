TRANSVERSALIS ABDOMINIS 409 arcuatum externum, gives origin to a part of the diaphragm. Between the middle and posterior layers is placed the erector spinse muscle. This posterior layer blends with the vertebral aponeurosis, and gives origin to the latissimus dorsi, the serratus posticus inferior, and other muscles. Nerve-supply.—The anterior primary branches of the lower thoracic nerves and the ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal branches of the first nerve of the lumbar plexus. The nerves as they run forward between this muscle and the obliquus interims distribute filaments to its outer surface. Action.—The muscles of the two sides with their intervening aponeurosis form a strong girth round the abdominal viscera, and by their contraction compress most powerfully the contents of the abdomen.

It will thus be seen that the three layers of the transverse muscle in the abdominal wall cross one another at various angles, one pair passing transversely forwards, a second forwards and upwards, and a third forwards and downwards. The following objects are gained by this arrangement: (1) the wall is rendered much stronger, and the probability of a hernial protrusion of any portion of the viscera between the separated fibres of the muscles is diminished; (2) contraction of the wall is permitted in every direction; (3) greater approximation of the mova- ble boundaries of the abdominal wall is obtained by means of the obliquity of the muscles which effect this movement. For example, two parallel bones can have the distance between them diminished only by one half, supposing that the mus- cular fibres producing this movement run perpendicularly from one bone to the other; but if the fibres cross one another obliquely, like those of the external and internal

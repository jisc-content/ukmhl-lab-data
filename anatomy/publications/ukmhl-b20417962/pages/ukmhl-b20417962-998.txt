918 THE ORGANS OF VOICE gland. Both the interior of the follicles and the spaces in the connecting areolar tissue may become filled with colloid material. Vessels.—The arteries—which are relatively very large and frequently anas- tomose—are the two superior thyroids, the two inferior thyroids, and an occasional branch which ascends on the front of the trachea, the thyroidea ima. This latter is derived either from the innominate artery or from the arch of the aorta. The superior thyroid arteries descend to supply the apices and inner and fore parts of the lateral lobes; whilst the inferior ascend to supply their outer and hinder portions below. The veins are the superior middle and the inferior thyroid. The two former join the internal jugular vein, and the latter the innominate of the corresponding side. The nerves are derived from the middle cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. Fig. 540.—Thymus Gland in a Child at Birth.

It reaches its highest de- velopment about the end of the second year. Although it occasionally retains a considerable size in the adult, it usually disappears or shrivels away to an insigni- ficant vestige.

838 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM The small cavernous nerves are several fine twigs which pierce the layers of the triangular ligament and the muscular structures which surround the membranous portion of the urethra. They enter the corpora cavernosa just in front of the subpubic ligament. The large cavernous nerve takes a similar course through the triangular liga- ment, and runs forwards on the dorsum penis as far as the middle of the organ, where it communicates with the dorsal nerves of the penis. It ends in twigs to the corpus cavernosum. In the female there are similar nerves, but of much smaller size, distributed to the clitoris. The vaginal plexus is formed largely by branches from the sacral nerves. It ramifies on the sides of the vagina, giving off twigs to the erectile substance, and to the mucous membrane. A few fine twigs pass forwards to reach the clitoris. The uterine plexus accompanies the uterine artery between the layers of the broad ligament, and, having received communicating twigs from the ovarian plexus, enters the muscular substance. In the gravid uterus this plexus is increased in size, chiefly on account of an hypertrophy of the connective tissue sheaths of the nerves. The more important fibres passing to the pelvic plexuses are described with the visceral branches of the sacral plexus.

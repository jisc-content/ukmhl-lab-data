537 ULNAR Relations.—In front: in addition to the skin and superficial fascia, the vessel is crossed successively, from within outwards, by the palmaris brevis, the palmar branch of the ulnar nerve, the palmar fascia, and the palmar branch of the median nerve. Behind, it rests upon, from within outwards, the short muscles of the little finger, the digital branches of the ulnar nerve, the flexor tendons, and the digital branches of the median nerve.

(A) It may be formed by the superficial branch of the ulnar anastomosing with the radialis indicis, or with the radial in the palm instead of with the superficial volar branch of the radial. (B) The superficial volar may be larger than usual, and take a greater share than the ulnar in the formation of the arch. (C) The arch may be reinforced by a large median artery, or by an enlarged interosseous artery. (D) The arch may be double, both the superficial branch of the ulnar and the superficial volar dividing

s;;-_> THE NERVOUS SYSTEM motor fibres, and secretory fibres to the lower limb, some vaso-constrictor fibres to the abdominal blood-vessels, motor fibres to the circular, and inhibitory fibres to the longitudinal muscle of the rectum: the latter enter the sympathetic cord by the lower dorsal nerves, they pass by the lumbar efferentes to the aortic plexus and terminate round the cells of the inferior mesenteric ganglion. The fibres which pass through the dorsal ganglia to the splanchnic nerves are mainly vaso-motor fibres to the abdominal blood-vessels, the majority of them probably terminate around the cells of the ganglia in the solar plexus, but those for the renal blood-vessels are said to end in the renal ganglia. In addition to all the above-mentioned fibres there are, in the dorsal part of the sympathetic cord afferent (splanchnic sensory) fibres, passing towards the posterior roots of the dorsal nerves.

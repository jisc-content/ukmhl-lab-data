935 THE HEART The Position of the Chief Orifices one to the other and to the Chest Wall The pulmonary orifice is placed in front of, and to the left of the right auriculo- ventricular opening, whilst the aortic orifice is in front of, and to the right of the left auriculo-ventricular opening. The relation of the valved orifices to the chest wall can only be approximately determined (Fig. 547). The pulmonary semilunar valves, which are anterior in position to the aortic, are placed behind the junction of the third rib with the sternum on the left side. Fig. 554.â€”Showing the Position of the Heart and its Valves in Eelation to the Chest Walls. (Reduced from Hensrnan and Fisher's Anatomical Outlines.) (The right auricle and ventricle, with the pulmonary semilunar and tricuspid valves, are outlined in blue tints; whilst the left auricle and ventricle, with their corresponding valves, are indicated in red.) The aortic semilunar valves, more deeply placed, correspond to the third space, close to the sternum. The tricuspid valve is situated behind the sternum near the middle line, about the level of the fourth space. The mitral valve lies deeply behind the sternum opposite the fourth cartilage (Fig. 547). The muscular walls of the heart vary very much in thickness, and the foetal differs from the adult heart in the relative muscularity of its chambers. The right auricle is thinner than the left, the right measuring about one-twelfth of an inch, and the left about one-eighth of an inch in thickness. The right ven-

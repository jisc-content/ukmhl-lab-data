OF VERTEBRAL COLUMN 191 Each disc is composed of two portions—a circumferential laminar, and a central pulpy portion; the former tightly surrounds and braces in the latter, and forms somewhat more than half the disc. The laminar portion consists of alter- nating layers of fibrous tissue and fibro-cartilage; the component fibres of these layers Fig. 199.—Horizontal Section through an Intervertebral Disc and the corresponding klbs. Fig. 200.—The Anterior Common Ligament of the Spine, the Stellate, the Inter- articular, and the Superior Costo-transverse Ligaments. The interarttcular ligament The superior or anterior costo-transverse ligaments The stellate ligament are firmty connected with two vertebra?, those of one passing obliquely down and to the right, those of the next down and to the left, making an X-shaped arrange- ment of the alternate layers. A feAV of the superficial lamellae project beyond the edges of the bodies, their fibres being connected with the edges of the anterior and

THE ARCH OF THE AORTA 467 THE ARCH OF THE AORTA The arch of the aorta (fig. 321) begins at the upper and back part of the left ventricle of the heart, behind the sternum, on a level with the lower border of the third left costal cartilage. Thence it passes upwards and slightly forwards and to the right, as high as the level of the upper border of the second costal cartilage of Fig. 321.â€”The Aech of the Aoeta, with the Pulmonaey Aeteey and Chief Branches of the Aoeta.

The arch thus formed has its convexity upwards and to the right; in its concavity are situated the left bronchus and the right pul- monary artery. According to its direction, it is somewdiat arbitrarily divided into an ascending, transverse, and descending part. Morphologically, the ascending

263 THE TIBIO-FIB ULAR UNION ligamentum patella? and front of the capsule. Extension is checked by both the crucial ligaments and the lateral ligaments (figs. 250, A, B, and 251). In flexion the ligamentum patella? and anterior portion of the capsule are on the stretch; so also is the posterior crucial in extreme flexion, though it is not quite tight in the semiflexed state of the joint. All the other ligaments are relaxed (fig. 250, C, D), although the relaxation of the anterior crucial ligament is slight in extreme flexion (fig. 252). Flexion is only checked during life by the contact of the soft parts, i.e. the calf with the back of the thigh. Inward rotation is checked by the anterior crucial ligament; the lateral liga- ments being loose. Outward rotation is checked by the lateral ligaments; the crucial ligaments have no controlling effect on it, as they are untwisted by it. Sliding movements are checked by the crucials and lateral ligaments—sliding forwards especially by the anterior, and sliding backwards by the posterior crucial. 3. THE TIBIOFIBULAR UNION The fibula is connected with the tibia throughout its length by an interosseous membrane, and at the upper and lower extremities by means of two joints. Very little movement is permitted between the two bones. (a) The superior tibio-fibular joint. (6) The middle tibio-fibular union, (c) The inferior tibio-fibular joint. (a) The Superior Tibio-fibular Joint Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Arthrodia. The superior tibio-fibular joint is about a quarter of an inch (6 mm.) below, and quite distinct from, the knee at its upper and anterior part; but at its posterior and

113 THE SCAPULA border is continuous with the inferior lip of the crest, with which it forms an angle; it gives origin to the deltoid. The tip of the acromion affords attachment to the coraco-acromial ligament. Of the three borders presented by the scapula, the external, or axillary, is the thickest, and extends from the posterior inferior angle to the lower margin of the glenoid cavity. Near its junction with the glenoid cavity there is a rough surface, from which the long head of the triceps arises; below this is the groove for the dorsal artery of the scapula. The subscapvlaris muscle encroaches on this border from the anterior surface, and the teretes from the posterior aspect. The posterior, or vertebral, border, sometimes called the base, is the longest; it extends from the posterior superior to the posterior inferior angle. It is very narrow, but affords attachment to three muscles: namely, the levator angidi scapidas above the spine; the rhomboideus minor on a level with the spine; and the rhomboideus mctjor, through the intervention of a fibrous arch from the spine to the inferior angle. The superior border is the shortest and thinnest, ending externally in the coracoid process. At the base of the coracoid is the suprascapular notch to the edges of which the transverse ligament is attached. Not unfrequently the notch is replaced by a suprascapular foramen. This notch or foramen transmits the suprascapular nerve, and occasionally the suprascapular artery, but as a rule the artery passes over the ligament. From the adjacent borders of the notch and from the ligament, the omo-hyoid takes origin. The anterior angle of the scapula is formed by the glenoid cavity. This cavity is shallow and pyriform, with its 8

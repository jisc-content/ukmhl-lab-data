LACHRYMAL APPARATUS 869 and duct, and at the lower end of the duct. That at the top of the duct is the most important, as it sometimes interferes with the proper flow of tears out of the sac. The total length of the lachrymal canal is roughly twenty-four millimetres, half of this being sac, and half nasal duct. If, however, we reckon as duct the oblique passage through the nasal mucous membrane, this measurement may occasionally be increased by eight or ten millimetres. The lachrymal sac, when distended, measures about six millimetres from before backwards, by four millimetres trans- versely. The nasal duct is practically circular, and has a diameter of about three millimetres, rather less at its junction with the sac, where we find the narrowest part of the whole lachrymal canal.

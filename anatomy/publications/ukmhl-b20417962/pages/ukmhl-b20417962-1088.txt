THE URINARY ORGANS 1008 fatty capsule, rests against the posterior abdominal wall, extending upwards in front of the eleventh and twelfth ribs and inwards to overlap the tips of the transverse processes of the first and second lumbar vertebrae; the left kidney usually reaching as high as the upper border of the eleventh rib, the right only to its lower border. The only visceral relation posteriorly is on the left side, where the spleen slightly overlaps the kidney opposite the upper half of its outer border. The parietal relations on both sides are as follows: (1) the diaphragm, and if a well- marked hiatus diaphragmaticus exist above the ligamentum arcuatum externum, the kidney may come into relation with the subpleural tissue and pleura; at this point the chest may become invaded by a circumrenal abscess, or an empyema may Fig. 611.—The Abdominal Viscera, seen from behind. (From the model of His.) The kidneys are somewhat lower than usual in their relations to the rihs. find its way from the pleura into the subperitoneal tissue behind the kidney; (2) the anterior lamella of the posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis (separating the organ from the quadratus lumborum; (3) the psoas; (4) the three fasciae— diaphragmatic, transversalis, and iliac—which line these muscles respectively; and (5) the last thoracic, the ilio-hypogastric, and the ilio-inguinal nerves, and the anterior divisions of the first and second lumbar vessels, all running obliquely downwards and outwards in front of the quadratus lumborum to pierce the transversalis beyond the outer border of the quadratus. Owing to the higher level of the left kidney, its diaphragmatic area of contact is larger than that of the right organ. This area, moreover, may be increased on either side when the arcuate

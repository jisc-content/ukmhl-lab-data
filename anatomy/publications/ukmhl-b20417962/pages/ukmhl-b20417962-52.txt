10 THE SKELETON is not bifid, but has two small lateral tubercles which give attachment to the liga- mentum nuchse. The transverse processes are of large size; the costal processes are very small; and the costo-transverse foramina are the smallest of the series or wanting. Very frequently the costal process is segmented off, and constitutes a cervical rib, sometimes of large size. Occasionally a demi-facet exists on each side of the lower border of the centrum for the head of the first rib. When this demi-facet is present, there is usually a well-developed cervical rib.

As a rule among Europeans, the second, third, fourth, and fifth vertebrae possess bifid spines. The sixth and seventh exhibit a tendency to bifurcate, their tips presenting two small lateral tubercles; sometimes the sixth has a bifid spine, and more rarely the seventh presents the same condition. Occasionally all the cervical spines, with the exception of the second, are non-bifid, and even in the axis the bifurcation is not extensive. In the lower races of men the cervical spines are relatively shorter and more stunted than in Europeans generally, and, as

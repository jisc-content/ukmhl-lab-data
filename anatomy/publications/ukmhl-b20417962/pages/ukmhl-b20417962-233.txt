TEMP OR O-MA NDIB ULAR 181 artery, and the middle meningeal artery. It is really the fibrous remnant of a part of the mandibular (Meckelian) bar. The stylo-mandibular ligament (stylo-maxillary) (figs. 191 and 192) is a process of the deep cervical fascia extending from near the tip of the styloid process to the angle and posterior border of the ramus of the jaw, between the masseter and Fig. 191.—External View of Temporo-mandibulak Joint. External portion of capsule ibular ligament Fig. 192.—Internal View of Temporo-mandibular Joint. Internal portion of capsule Spheno-mandibular ligament Stylo-mandibular ligament internal pterygoid muscles. It separates the parotid from the submaxillary gland, and gives origin to some fibres of the stylo-glossus muscle. The arterial supply is derived from the temporal, middle meningeal, and ascending pharyngeal by its branches to the Eustachian tube. The nerves are derived from the masseteric and auriculotemporal.

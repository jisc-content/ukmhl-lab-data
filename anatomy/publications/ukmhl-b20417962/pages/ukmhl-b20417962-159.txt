109 THE CLAVICLE ascending from the last rib to the lower border of the gladiolus (mesosternum). These two borders form the subcostal angle, and the xiphoid (metasternum) Fig. 117.â€”The Thoeax. (Front view.) projects into the middle of it. The intervals between the ribs are the intercostal spaces, and are eleven in number on each side. THE CLAVICLE The clavicle is a rod of bone passing from the top of the sternum to the acro- mion process of the scapula. It presents two curves: an inner, with the convexity directed forwards; and an outer, the smaller, with the convexity directed back- wards. The clavicle consists, for descriptive purposes, of an outer flattened, and an inner prismatic portion. The outer third has two surfaces and two borders. The superior surface looks directly upwards, and affords attachment to the trapezius muscle posteriorly, and the deltoid anteriorly; a small tract intervening between the muscles is subcu- taneous. The inferior surface is rough, and at its most posterior part presents the tuberosity (or conoid tubercle) of the clavicle; it overhangs the coracoid process and gives attachment to the conoid ligament. From the tuberosity a ridge, the oblique line, runs outwards and forwards; to it, the trapezoid ligament is attached. The anterior border is thin; presents often a small prominence, the

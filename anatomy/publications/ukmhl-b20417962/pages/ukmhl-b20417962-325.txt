THE TARSAL JOINTS 271 The advantages of the obliquity and peculiar arrangement of the posterior caleaneo-astragaloid articulation are seen in walking: (i) for the posterior facet of the calcaneum receives the whole weight of the body when the heel is first placed on the ground; (ii) by the upward pressure of this facet against the astragalus it transfers the weight to the ball of the toes as the heel is raised, the hinder edge of the sustentaculum tali and the anterior and outer part of the upper surface of the calcaneum preventing the astragalus from being displaced too far forward by the superincumbent weight; and (iii) the calcaneum serves to suspend the astragalus when, with the heel raised by muscular action, the other foot is being swung forwards. The synovial membrane is the same as that of the astragalo-scaphoid joint. The arteries and nerves are derived from the same sources as those of the medio- tarsal joints. (6) The Articulations of the Anterior Part of the Tarsus These include (i) the cubo-scaphoid; (ii) scapho-cuneiform; (iii) intercunei- form; and (iv) cubo-cuneiform joints. (i) The Cubo-scaphoid Union Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Arthrodia. The ligaments which unite the cuboid and scaphoid are: Dorsal. Plantar. Interosseous. The dorsal cubo-scaphoid ligament (fig. 256) runs forwards and outwards from the outer end of the dorsal surface of the scaphoid to the middle third of the inner

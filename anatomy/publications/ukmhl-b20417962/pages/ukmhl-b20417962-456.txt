390 THE MUSCLES influence upon the second and third phalanges, but the distal part of its tendon is acted upon chiefly by the short muscles in tbe sole of the foot, which are attached to the border of the expansion upon the first phalanx. When the muscle contracts to its fullest extent, the first phalanges are extended, while the second and third phalanges are somewhat flexed by the long and short flexors. (2) To flex the ankle-joint. (3) Slightly to abduct and evert the front part of the foot.

Externally, the peroneus longus and brevis, the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and, lower down, the peroneus tertius. Behind, the anterior tibial nerve above, and the ankle-joint, tarsal and metatarsal bones, and the extensor brevis digitorum below. Variations.—The muscle may be divided nearly up to its origin. It may give off slips to the extensor proprius hallucis, extensor brevis digitorum, or one of the interossei. Sometimes also it has an insertion into some of the metatarsal bones.

378 THE MUSCLES First Layer 1. ABDUCTOR HALLUCIS The abductor hallucis—named from its action upon the great toe—is a thick triangular sheet, with a broad origin behind, which is divided into two heads. Origin.—Outer head : (1) The front and inner surfaces of the inner or greater tubercle on the under surface of the calcaneum; (2) the deep surface of the inner Fig. 293.—First Layer of the Muscles of the Sole. portion of the plantar fascia; (3) the intermuscular septum which separates it from the flexor brevis digitorum. Inner head : (1) The deep aspect of the lower border of the internal annular ligament; (2) the under surface of the attachment of the tendon of the tibialis posticus to the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone and the adjacent prolongations of this tendon. Insertion.—The inner part of the lower surface of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe and the inner side of the internal sesamoid bone. Occasionally, also, the inner border of the expansion of the extensor proprius hallucis on the back of the first phalanx. Structure.—The outer head arises in close connection with the flexor brevis digitorum by short tendinous fibres, soon succeeded by a divergent fleshy bundle which is joined about two inches (5 cm.) from its origin by the fleshy sheet formed

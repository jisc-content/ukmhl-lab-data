THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 796 and another which crosses the secundii internodii pollicis to reach the extensor indicis; then, leaving the posterior interosseous artery, it dips beneath the extensor secundii internodii pollicis and comes into relation with the anterior interosseous artery, which it accompanies upon the interosseous membrane and the back of the radius, passing through the groove for the extensor communis digitorum and the extensor indicis, to the back of the wrist, where it terminates in a gangliform en- largement, from which branches are given to the carpal articulations. The muscles supplied by the posterior interosseous nerve are the extensor carpi radialis brevior, Fig. 459.â€”A Dissection of the Cutaneous Nerves on the Doesal Aspect of the Hand and Fingers. (H. St. J. B.) The branches of the median nerve are shown in black. the supinator brevis, the extensor communis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, extensor carpi ulnaris, the three extensor muscles of the thumb, and the extensor indicis. The supinator brevis receives two twigs, one of which is given off before the nerve pierces the muscle, and the other while it is traversing the muscular substance. (/) The radial nerve is somewhat smaller than the posterior interosseous, and is a purely cutaneous nerve. It runs downwards under cover of the supinator longus, crossing the radial recurrent artery and the supinator brevis; it approaches the radial artery at an acute angle, and runs parallel to the outer side of that vessel

EXTERNAL EAR—MIDDLE EAR 873 side to side. Owing to the obliquity of the membrana tympani, the floor is longer than the roof, and the anterior longer than the posterior wall of the canal. Its cartilaginous portion, which is a little less than half an inch (11 mm.) in length, is formed by the incomplete tube of cartilage already described, with fibrous membrane to complete its upper and front part. The osseous portion of the tube, a little more than half an inch (14 mm.) in length, is slightly curved, with its convexity looking upwards and backwards (%• 496). The lining membrane is a reflexion from the skin externally. It is thick and strong in the cartilaginous, but becomes thinner in the osseous portion; especially is this the case near the membrana tympani, over which it is reflected to form its cuticular layer. In the cartilaginous portion the dermis is supplied with numerous hairs, and sebaceous glands open into their follicles. Tubular ceruminous glands, the orifices of which stud the whole of the cartilaginous portion, appear as dark points to the naked eye. These glands extend a short distance into the upper and back part of the bony meatus, in the form of a triangular patch, but elsewhere they appear to be absent. The arteries are derived from the posterior auricular, temporal, and internal maxillary; and the nerves from the auriculo-temporal and the auricular branch of the vagus. THE MIDDLE EAR The Membrana Tympani is an irregularly rounded concave membrane stretched obliquely across the bottom of the osseous meatus in such wise as to form an obtuse angle with its upper wall (according to Von Troltsch, 140°) and an acute one with its lower. The circumference of the membrane is lodged in the groove of the tympanic

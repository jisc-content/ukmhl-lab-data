THE SPHENOID :;i wall of the orbit; it forms the inner boundary of the sphenoidal fissure, and more posteriorly is grooved for the internal carotid artery and cavernous sinus. The process of bone over which this artery turns is the lingula; it constitutes a flying buttress for the support of the greater wings. The lesser or orbital wings (orbito-sphenoids) are thin, triangular, horizontal plates of bone resting upon that portion of the sphenoid anterior to the olivary ridge (pre-sphenoid). The superior surface of each wing is smooth and slightly Fig. 37.—The Left Half of the Sphenoid.

The anterior border is serrated for articulation with the horizontal plate of the frontal bone. The posterior border, smooth and rounded, is received into the Sylvian fissure of the cerebrum. The inner extremity is pro- longed to form the anterior clinoid process to which the tentorium cerebelli is attached. Each lesser wing is connected to the body of the bone by two processes Fig. 38.—The Sphenoid. (Anterior view.) ORBITAL SURFACE (THE POINTER CROSSES THE MALAR CREST) EXT.

The opening between the roots is the optic foramen, and transmits the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery. The greater wings (ali-sphenoids) are two large plates of bone ankylosed to the body by means of the lingulae. Each wing has three surfaces. The superior or cerebral surface is concave and smooth; it receives the temporo-sphenoidal lobe of the cerebrum, and presents several foramina. At the anterior and internal part is

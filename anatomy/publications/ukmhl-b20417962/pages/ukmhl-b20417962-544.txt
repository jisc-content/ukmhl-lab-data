THE ARTERIES 476 left pneumogastric nerve; and, slightly overlapping it, the edge of the left pleura and lung (fig. 328). The variations in the origin of the left common carotid are given under VARIATIONS OF THE Arch op the Aorta (page 471). THE COMMON CAROTID ARTERY IN THE NECK The common carotid artery in the neck extends from the sterno-clavicular articulation to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage on a level with the fourth cervical vertebra where it divides into the external and internal carotid arteries. A line drawn from the sterno-clavicular joint to the interval between the mastoid process and the angle of the jaw would indicate its course. The artery is at first Fig. 328.â€”Scheme of the Relations of the Left Common Carotid and Left Subclavian Arteries within the Thorax. (Walsham.) I, just above origin ; II, just below level of sterno-clavicular joint. 1 deeply placed beneath the sterno-mastoid, sterno-hyoid, and sternothyroid muscles, and at the level of the top of the sternum is only three-quarters of an inch (2 cm.) distant from its fellow of the opposite side, and merely separated from it by the trachea. As the carotid arteries run up the neck, however, they diverge in the form of a V and become more superficial, though on a plane posterior to that in which they lie at the root of the neck, and are separated from each other by the larynx and pharynx. At their bifurcation they are about two inches and a quarter (6 cm.) apart. The common carotid is contained in a sheath of fascia common to it and the internal jugular vein and pneumogastric nerve. The artery, vein, and nerve, however, are not in contact, but separated from one another by fibrous septa, which divide the common sheath into three compartments: one for the artery, one for the vein, and one for the nerve. The vein, which is larger than the artery, lies to the outer side, and somewhat overlaps the artery. The pneumo-

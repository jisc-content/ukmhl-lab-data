626 THE VEINS ticosse, which leave the globe midway between the cornea and entrance of the optic nerve. The latter veins are four or five in number, the upper ending in the supe- rior, the lower in the inferior ophthalmic vein (page 852). (3) The anterior and posterior ethmoidal veins correspond in their course with the arteries of the same name. They enter the orbit through the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina, and join either the ophthalmic direct, or one or other of the superior muscular branches. ( 4) The lachrymal vein returns the blood from the lachrymal gland, and corre- sponds in its course to the lachrymal artery. (5) The central vein of the retina runs with the central artery in the optic nerve. It joins the superior ophthalmic at the back of the orbit.

The inferior ophthalmic vein, smaller than the superior, is formed near the front of the orbit by the confluence of the inferior muscular with the lower posterior ciliary veins. It runs backwards below the optic nerve, along the floor of the orbit, and either joins the superior ophthalmic vein to form the common ophthalmic trunk, or else opens separately into the cavernous sinus. A large communicating branch passes downwards through the spheno-maxillary fissure to join the pterygoid plexus of veins. Tributaries.—(1) The inferior muscular, which are derived from the inferior oblique, inferior rectus, and external rectus; and (2) the lower posterior ciliary veins. 7. THE VEINS OF THE PHARYNX AND LARYNX The veins of the pharynx are arranged in the form of a plexus, between the constrictor muscles and the pharyngeal or prevertebral fascia. The plexus receives branches from the mucous membrane, from the soft palate, the Eustachian tube, and the anterior recti and longus colli muscles. Above, it communicates with the

This fissure is therefore not a breach in the ventricle, but simply a thin part of the wall through which the locally thickened pia mater (choroid plexus) Fig. 414.—Diagrammatic Coronal Section of Third and Lateral Ventricles.

Fig. 415.—Coronal Section of the Hemispheres passing through the Anterior Cornua of the Lateral Ventricles. (From a mounted specimen in the Anatomical Department of Trinity College, Dublin.) can be seen. Each lateral ventricle consists of a central part or body and three cornua: an anterior, an inferior or descending, and a posterior. The body may be defined as the portion of the ventricle which extends from

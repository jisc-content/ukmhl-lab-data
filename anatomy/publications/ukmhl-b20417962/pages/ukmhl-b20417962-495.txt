0 CCIP1TO-FR OXTA LIS 427 cervical plexus, together with the masseter, and huccinator, the muscles of the front and side of the neck, and the pectoralis major and deltoid. Its anterior border lies externally to the sterno-clavicular joint, and is often conspicuous in the aged, in whom the two muscles may be seen to hang, like a dewlap, beneath the chin, and then to divide into the two separate folds formed by their internal borders, which run outwards and downwards towards the clavicles. Variations.—The anterior border of the muscle may be placed as far backwards as the middle of the clavicle, and in some cases the muscle has been entirely absent. Slips have been seen going to the side of the thyroid cartilage, the auricle or the mastoid process. 2. OCCIPITO-FRONTALIS The occipito-frontalis—named from its two muscular bellies, which cover parts of the occipital and frontal bones—consists of two curved muscular sheets united by a strong aponeurosis, and is best described in three parts—viz. the occipitalis and frontalis muscles and the epicranial aponeurosis. (1) The occipitalis is a small quadrilateral sheet. Origin.—(1) The outer two-thirds of the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone, and (2) a ridge upon the mastoid process.

SUPERFICIAL ANATOMY OF THE UPPER LIMB THE SHOULDER The following surface-marks, of the greatest importance in determining the nature of shoulder injuries, can be made out here :â€”The clavicle in its whole extent, the acromion process, the great tuberosity, and upper part of the shaft of the humerus. Much less distinctly, the position of the coracoid process and the head of the humerus can be made out. The anterior margin of the clavicle, convex internally and concave externally, can be made out in its whole extent, .the bone, if traced outwards, being found not to be horizontal, but rising somewhat to its junction with the acromion. The tip of this process, when the arm hangs by the side, is in the same line as the external condyle and the styloid process of the radius. On the inner side, the head and internal condyle of the humerus and the styloid process of the ulna are in the same line. Thus the

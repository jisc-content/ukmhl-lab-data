THE CLITORIS 1041 extremity of each is posterior and extends backwards nearly to the posterior com- missure, touching the gland of Bartholin. The narrow anterior extremity, the pars intermedialis of Kobelt, runs forwards to meet its fellow of the opposite side beneath the clitoris. Superiorly, it is fixed to the superficial triangular ligament of the perinseum, while it is in relation internally to the urethral and vaginal orifices, and externally is invested by the fibres of the bulbo-cavernosus. It consists of erectile tissue, enveloped by a thin tunica albuginea. During the condition of engorgement it helps to narrow the vestibular portion of the vulva and the entrance of the vagina. The vessels and nerves of the clitoris and bulbi vestibuli are the same as those of the analogous parts of the male. The muscles appended to the erectile structures again are very similar to those described in connection with the penis. The ischio-cavernosi are identical in attachments with the erectores penis; but the bulbo-cavernosi are separated in the middle line by the vulvar fissure, and appear on each side as a delicate, and sometimes very indistinct, plane of muscular fibres, called the constrictor vaginae, attached behind to the tendinous centre of the perinseum, and breaking up in front into tendinous slips which run in close external relation to the bulbi vestibuli, and become lost above and below the clitoris. Their function is to compress the bulbs and to constrict the vestibule and vaginal orifice. The transversi perinaei have the same connections as in the male.

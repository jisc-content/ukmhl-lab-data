1145 ORIGIN OF SPINAL NERVES A vertical line from the sixth thoracic to the third sacral spine will give the spinal origin of the muscle. Another from the third sacral spine to a point on the iliac crest, an inch or more outside the edge of the erector spina?, will give the origin of the muscle from the sheath of the erector spina? and the ilium. A line from the sixth thoracic spine, almost transversely at first, with increasing slight obliquity over the inferior angle of the scapula to the axilla and bicipital groove, will mark the upper border of the muscle. Another very oblique line from the point on the iliac crest upwards and outwards to the axilla will give the lower border and the tapering triangular apex of the insertion. The muscle may be attached to the angle of the scapula, or separated from it by a bursa. Fig. 708.—Kelations of the Abdominal Visceea to the Anterior Parietes. (Treves.) Triangle of Petit.—This small space lies above the crest of the ilium, at about its centre, bounded by the anterior edge of the latissimus and the posterior border of the external oblique. Origin of spinal nerves.—It is very important to remember the relations of these to the vertebral spines, in determining the results of disease or injury of the cord and the parts thereby affected. The above relation may be given briefly as follows:— The origins of the eight cervical nerves correspond to the cord between the occi- put and the sixth cervical spine. The upper six thoracic come off between the above spine and that of the fourth thoracic vertebra. The origins of the lower six thoracic nerves correspond to the interval between the fourth and the tenth thoracic

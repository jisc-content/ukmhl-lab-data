THE SKELETON 76 The bones visible in this view of the skull are: the frontal, nasals, lachrymals, orbital surfaces of the lesser and the greater wings, and a portion of the body of the sphenoid, the ossa plana of the ethmoid, and the orbital processes of the palate bones, the malars, maxilla;, inferior turbinals, and the mandible. The foramina are: the supraorbital, infraorbital, optic, temporal, and mental; the lachrymal duct; the malar and ethmoidal canals; and the spheno-maxillary and sphenoidal fissures. The orbits are two cavities of pyramidal shape, which lodge the eyeball and its Fig. 84.—The Skull. (Norma facialis.)

The apex of each orbit corresponds to the optic foramen, a circular orifice which transmits the optic nerve and oph- thalmic artery. The base looks forwards and outwards. It is formed by the frontal bone above, the nasal process of the maxilla on the inner side, the malar bone externally, and below by the malar and body of the maxilla. The following points are seen around the base:—The suture between the external angular process of the frontal bone and the malar; the supraorbital notch (sometimes a complete

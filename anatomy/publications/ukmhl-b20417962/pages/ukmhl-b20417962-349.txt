295 PECTORALIS MAJOR the sternum) being attached to the lower part of the horseshoe, where they become continuous with those forming the anterior segment of the tendon. In consequence of this arrangement the lower fibres of the muscle disappear from view soon after their origin, and are concealed by the clavicular and upper sterno-costal fibres. This arrangement gives to the anterior border of the axilla a concave outline. Were it not for this decussation, the muscle would be broader and thinner, and would cause an inconvenient and unsightly projection in front of the axilla. The sterno-costal portion may usually be divided into a superficial and deep plane, the superficial being composed of the sternal and external oblique origin; the deep, of the fibres which spring from the ribs and their cartilages. Fig. 264.—The Pectoealis Majoe and Deltoid. Nerve-supply.—From all the nerves of the brachial plexus:—(1) through the external anterior thoracic nerve, which enters the deep surface of the muscle just below the middle of its upper border; and (2) through the internal anterior thoracic, which, after piercing and supplying the pectoralis minor, enters the deep surface of the muscle a little lower down, half-way between its origin and insertion. Action.—To adduct, flex, and rotate inwards the upper arm. By its clavicular portion it will draw the arm more directly forwards, as in round-hand bowling, while the sterno-costal portion will draw the arm more downwards than forwards. The whole muscle will be used with great force in striking a blow downwards and forwards. When the arm hangs close to the side, the pectoralis major will draw the scapula forwards and downwards, so as to advance and depress the point of the shoulder, as may be seen in a person shivering with cold. When the arm is

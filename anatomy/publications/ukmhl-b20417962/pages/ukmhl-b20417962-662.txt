THE ARTERIES 588 forating the deep fascia, supply the skin and fascia of the calf. A branch, usually of moderate size, accompanies the short or external saphenous vein, and is sometimes called the posterior saphenous artery. (2) The muscular or sural branches are commonly divided into the superior and inferior. They arise from the upper and lower portions of the popliteal respectively; the former supply the muscles forming the boundaries of the upper half of the popliteal space; the latter, the muscles of the calf. (a) The upper muscular branches—or superior sural, as they are sometimes called—are distributed to the hamstring muscles and lower part of the adductor Fig. 375.—Side View of the Right Popliteal Aeteey. (From a dissection in the Hunterian Museum.) magnus. They anastomose with the superior articular arteries, and with the ter- mination of the profunda. (6) The inferior muscular or sural branches, usually two in number and of large size, come off from the popliteal just as it passes under cover of the inner head of the gastrocnemius. They at first descend between the two heads of the latter muscle, one branch then entering the outer, and one the inner head. They also supply branches to the soleus and plantaris muscles. (3) The articular, five in number, are divided into two superior (internal and external), two inferior (internal and external), and the azygos, or anterior. The superior and inferior come off transversely in pairs from either side of the popliteal,

16 THE SKELETON processes. The first pair are large for the last lumbar vertebra, the second and third are small, and the fourth and fifth are inconspicuous. Immediately external to the articular processes are the posterior sacral foramina, four on each side; they are smaller than the anterior, and give exit to the posterior divisions of the first four sacral nerves. External to the foramina there are five eminences on each side, representing the fused transverse processes. The first pair are large and conspicuous, and all give attachment to ligaments and muscles; the second form part of the articular surface for the ilium. The furrow formed by the laminae, and bounded on the median aspect by the spinous, and Fig. 19.â€”Base of Sacrum. ARTICULAR PF I SACRAL externally by-the articular processes, is known as the sacral groove, and lodges the mitltifidus spinse muscle. The upper surface, or base, of the sacrum resembles the corresponding aspect of a lumbar vertebra, and its articular processes have -well-marked mammillary tubercles. The conjoint transverse and costal processes form on each side a broad surface, the wing or ala. From its margin the iliacus has a small point of origin.

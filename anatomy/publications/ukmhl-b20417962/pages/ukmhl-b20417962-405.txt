347 PSOAS the angle which exists between the neck and shaft of the femur, the line of the tendon of the psoas passes either through or external to this axis. The action, therefore of the muscle when the knee is extended will be either to produce no rota- tion at all, or to rotate inwards. When the knee is flexed or when the thigh is broken the axis of rotation is altered, and in the latter case the psoas may become an external rotator. It will follow, therefore, that any power of rotation exercised by this muscle will be rather internal than external. Acting from below, the psoas will flex the lower thoracic and the lumbar spine upon the'pelvis and the pelvis upon the thigh, as when the body is raised from the reclining to the sitting position, or when the trunk is bent forwards in rowing. Fig. 286.—Psoas, Iliacus, and Quadkatus Lumbokum. Relations.—The front and inner surfaces are covered by the iliac fascia, which at the upper part of the muscle is thickened, and forms the ligamentum arcuatum internum of the diaphragm. In front lie also the peritoneum, the intestines, the kidney, ureter, and the renal vessels, and the spermatic or ovarian vessels. On the outer side is the iliacus muscle. In the interior of the muscle is the lumbar plexus, the nerves from which run for some distance in its substance. On the inner side lies the external iliac artery; and behind is the inner border of the quadratus lumboruan and the brim of the pelvis. In the thigh, after passing beneath Poupart's ligament, it is covered by the femoral artery, the pectineus lies along its inner border, and the capsule of the hip-joint lies behind it, together with the intervening bursa. Variations.—Sometimes the part of the psoas which arises from the lower lumbar vertebrae forms a distinct muscle. Occasionally fibres from the psoas parvus join the psoas magnus.

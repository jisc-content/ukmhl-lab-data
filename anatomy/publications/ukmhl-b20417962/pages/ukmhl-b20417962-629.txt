555 CCELIAC B. The Visceral Branches of the Abdominal Aorta THE CCELIAC ARTERY The cceliac artery—or cceliac axis as it is commonly called, because it breaks up simultaneously into three branches which radiate from it like the spokes of a wheel from the axle—is a short thick trunk given off from the front of the aorta between the crura of the diaphragm a little below the aortic opening. It passes horizontally forwards above the upper margin of the pancreas for about half an inch, and then breaks up into three branches for the supply of the stomach, duodenum, spleen, pancreas, liver, and gall-bladder (fig. 365). Relations.—In front is the lesser omentum; behind, the aorta; above, the right lobe of the liver; below, the pancreas; to the right, the right semilunar ganglion and lobulus Spigelii of the liver; to the left, the left semilunar ganglion and the cardiac end of the stomach. It is closely surrounded by the dense solar plexus of sympathetic nerves. Variations.—(A) The coeliac axis may be absent; the branches usually arising from it then coining off separately from the aorta. (B) It may be shorter or longer than usual. Under the latter circumstance the branches are commonly given off separately from the trunk of the vessel instead of radiating from one spot. (C) It may give off two brandies only : these are usually the splenic and hepatic^ more rarely the gastric and the splenic. (D) It may give off more than three branches, the additional branch being one of the phrenics ; a trunk common to the twophrenics; a gastro-duodenal; a second gastric or splenic artery, or the superior mesenteric; the median colic or the pancreatica magna. (E) One or other of the branches normal to the cceliac axis may be absent, or replaced by a stem common to the phrenics, or by the right suprarenal and the right gastro-epiploic, or more rarely by some other branch. Branches of the cceliac artery.—The cceliac axis gives off the gastric, hepatic, and splenic arteries.

The liver is very movable, and alters its position under various circumstances. It is depressed at each inspiration, the anterior border being pushed below the ribs by a deep breath. When lying down, the liver edge is half an inch above the margin of the ribs. In children, the gland being larger in proportion to the body Fig. 582.â€”Relation of the Abdominal Viscera to the Paeietes. (Treves.) than in the adult state, it extends below the ril >s and reaches the left hypochon- drium. The liver's extreme left point is about an inch and a half beyond the left margin of the sternum; in front, in the middle line, it reaches to about half way between the xiphoid cartilage and the navel. The lower edge as it crosses the subcostal angle is represented by a line drawn from the ninth right to the eighth left costal cartilage. (Quain.) Its upper limit is indicated by a line crossing the mesosternum close to its lower end, and rising on the right side in the mammary line to the level of the fifth rib. On the left the line is practically horizontal. Behind, the liver is nearest the surface at the tenth and eleventh thoracic vertebras.

811 BRANCHES OF THE SACRAL PLEXUS 6. The small sciatic nerve springs from the posterior aspect of the second and third sacral nerves, and, passing downwards, escapes through the great sacro-sciatic foramen by passing below the pyriformis. It then runs downwards on the posterior surface of the great sciatic nerve, under cover of the gluteus maximus muscle, to which it furnishes a branch. This branch is probably a portion of the inferior gluteal nerve, which has adhered in a part of its course to the small sciatic. Emerging from beneath the gluteus maximus it crosses the biceps, accompanied by a branch of the sciatic artery, and passing down, beneath the deep fascia it enters Fig. 465.â€”Diagram of the Lumbar axd Sacral Plexuses.

In its course down the thigh it gives off numerous branches, which pierce the fascia lata to supply the skin covering the back of the thigh and the popliteal space. At the lower border of the gluteus maximus it gives off (a) reflected branches, and (b) a large branch termed the long pudendal nerve. (a) The reflected branches, three or four in number, wind round the lower

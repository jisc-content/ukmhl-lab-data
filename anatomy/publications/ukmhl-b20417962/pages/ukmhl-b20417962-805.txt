METENCEPHALON 725 not visible to the unaided eye, and therefore will be dealt with very briefly here. It is usually classified into two categories: (a) Representatives of the grey crescents of the spinal cord; and (6) nuclei or aggregations of grey matter not represented in the spinal cord. As will be seen on consulting the section on the Spinal Cord, the grey matter of the latter consists of a pair of bilaterally symmetrical grey cres- cents which are united in the middle line by a grey commissure. In the centre of this commissure is the central canal of the cord. The central canal extends upwards into the lower or distal part of the medulla, but, in the upper part of the last-named structure, the posterior columns diverge from one another so that the central canal opens out and expands into the floor of the fourth ventricle. There- fore the ependyma which surrounds the central canal, together with the grey masses at the bases of both anterior and posterior horns, is spread out on the floor Fig. 431.â€”Transverse Section of the Medulla a little above the Lower Extremity of the Fourth Ventricle.

From the nerve-cells in this grey matter some of the cranial nerves, which take their origin in the medulla, arise. The grey matter of the base of the anterior horn suffers but little displacement, and lies in a column on each side of the sulcus longitudinalis medianus, and from this a motor nerve (the twelfth) arises. The sixth nerve arises in series with the twelfth in the tegmental region of the pons, and the nuclei of the fourth and third nerves continue this motor column of cells brainwards in the floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius. The grey matter of the base of the posterior horn is displaced laterally, so that it underlies the surface markings which have been described above as ala cinerea and tuberculum acusticum, and from this grey matter the sensory parts of the tenth and ninth nerves and part of the eighth nerve arise. The heads of both of the horns of the grey crescents are also represented in the medulla. At

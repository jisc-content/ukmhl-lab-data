OPTIC NERVE 861 nerve loosely as its outer or dural sheath. The nerve is closely enveloped by a vascular covering derived from the pia mater, named accordingly the pial sheath. The space between these two sheaths, known as the inter vaginal space, is subdivided by a fine prolongation of the arachnoid (the arachnoidal sheath) into two parts, viz. an outer, narrow, subdural,- and an inner, wider, subarachnoid Fig. 487.—Transverse Section through Optic Nerve, showing the Relations of its Sheaths and Connective Tissue Framework. SUBARACHNOID SPACE — SUBDURAL SPACE —I tes in ■-fibre space, communicating with the corresponding intracranial spaces. The arachnoidal sheath is connected with the sheath on each side of it by numerous tine processes which bridge across the intervening spaces. The pial sheath sends processes inwards, which form a framework separating the bundles of nerve-fibres; between the enclosed nerve-fibres and each mesh of this framework there is a narrow interval Fig. 488.—Longitudinal Section through Termination of Optic Nerve. —T'ss^-^ / PHYSIOLOGICAL PIT TIssTE FRAMEWORK occupied by lymph. The nerve-fibres are medullated, but have no primitive sheath. About fifteen or twenty millimetres behind the globe the central vessels enter, piercing obliquely the lower outer quadrant of the nerve, and then run forward in its axis. They are accompanied throughout by a special process of the pial sheath, which forms a fibrous cord in the centre of the nerve.

THE ORGANS OF CIRCULATION 928 The grooves are placed near the borders of the heart, so that the right ventricle is mainly anterior, and the left posterior. Of the four cavities into which the heart is divided, the right auricle and ventricle constitute its venous side, whilst the left auricle and ventricle belong to its arterial side. The right auricle receives the venous blood of the body through the two vense cava?, and of the heart through the coronary sinus, and transmits it into the right ventricle. The right ventricle in turn transmits the venous blood to the lungs through the pulmonary artery. From the lungs it is returned arterialised to the left auricle of the heart by the pulmonary veins. From the auricle it passes into Fig. 547. — Showing the Position of the Heart and its Valves in Eelation to the Chest Walls. (Reduced from Hensman and Fisher's Anatomical Outlines.) (The right auricle anil ventricle, with the pulmonary semilunar and tricuspid valves, are outlined in blue tints; whilst the left auricle and ventricle, with their corresponding valves, are indicated in red.) the corresponding ventricle, and thence through the aorta and its branches to all parts of the body, including the heart itself. The right auricle.—The right auricle forms the upper and right part of the heart; below it is the right ventricle; to the inner side anteriorly it embraces the root of the pulmonary artery, and posteriorly it is separated from the left auricle by the interauricular septum, and it is in relation with the right inferior pulmo- nary vein. It is lined by a smooth and delicate membrane, the endocardium, which is continuous with the inner coats of the blood-vessels. It presents a large quadrangular cavity, the sinus venosus or atrium, and one much smaller within the auricular appendix. The auricle forms the right and fore part of the base of the heart,

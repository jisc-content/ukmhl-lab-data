EXTENSOR CARPI ULNARIS—ANCONEUS 327 3. EXTENSOR CARPI ULNARIS The extensor carpi ulnaris—named from its action upon the carpus and its position on the ulnar border of the forearm—is a fusiform sheet. Origin.—By two heads. The first head: (1) By the common tendon from the back of the external condyle; (2) the front of the deep fascia of the forearm; and (3) the intermuscular septa which separate it from the extensor minimi digiti, the anconeus, and the supinator brevis. The second head : from the posterior border of the ulna, by the aponeurosis common to it, the flexor carpi ulnaris, and the flexor profundus digitorum. Insertion.—The back of the base of the fifth metacarpal bone, close to its ulnar border. Structure.—The fleshy fibres converge below upon the tendon of insertion, which, beginning in the interior of the muscle in the middle of the forearm, soon becomes visible upon the radial border of the back of the muscle. It receives fleshy fibres in penniform fashion upon its ulnar border and deep surface nearly as far as the wrist, where it enters the sixth compartment of the posterior annular ligament, and lies in a special groove to the outer side of the styloid process of the ulna. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through the eighth cervical nerve) by branches from the posterior interosseous division of the musculo-spiral nerve which enter the deep surface of the muscle about the middle of the forearm. Action.—(1) To extend the wrist, acting upon the three articulations involved in this movement; (2) to adduct the wrist, especially when the hand is pronated; (3) it will also help in the extension of the elbow-joint. Relations.—Superficially, the deep fascia of the forearm, and the posterior annular ligament; deeply, the supinator brevis, the extensors of the thumb, ex- tensor indicis, posterior interosseous artery, the inner half of the posterior sur- face of the ulna below the middle of the forearm, the wrist, and some carpal joints. On the outer side lies the extensor minimi digiti; on the inner, the anconeus muscle. Variations.—Frequently a small slip of tendon passes downwards to join the tendon of the preceding muscle, the first phalanx, or the head of the metacarpal bone. Occasionally the fourth or even the third metacarpal bone may receive a slip. 4. ANCONEUS The anconeus—named from its intimate relation with the elbow {ayx&v)—is a triangular fan-shaped sheet. Origin.—-(1) The lower part of the back of the external condyle; and (2 ) the adjacent part of the posterior ligament of the el bow-joint. Insertion.—The rough triangular impression upon the outer surface (1) of the olecranon, and (2) of the upper third of the back of the ulna. Structure.—This muscle is a continuation downwards of the lower part of the inner head of the triceps. Arising by a short tendon, which is prolonged upon the deep surface of the muscle and along its outer border, the fleshy fibres diverge in a fan shape, and are inserted either directly or by short tendinous fibres into the large special impression upon the ulna; the highest fibres being nearly horizontal, and the lowest approaching more nearly to a vertical direction. Nerve-supply.—From the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (through the seventh and eighth cervical nerves) by a long branch from the musculo-spiral nerve, which, after passing through the inner head of the triceps muscle, enters the deep aspect of the anconeus close to its upper border. Action.—To extend the elbow, in association with the triceps, of which some authors consider it to form a fourth head. Relations.—Superficially, the deep fascia of the forearm; deeply, the supinator

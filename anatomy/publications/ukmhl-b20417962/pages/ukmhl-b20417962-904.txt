824 Fig. 469b.—Diagram showing the Areas of Distribution of Cutaneous Nerves. . Head:—■ Red—First division of fifth. White—Second division of fifth. Blue—Third division of fifth. Dark area—Posterior primary divisions of cervical nerves. Oblique and transverse shading—Branches of cervical plexus. Body and Limes:—■ Red—Anterior divisions of anterior primary branches. Blue—Posterior division of anterior primary branches. Two colors in one area indicate that the area is supplied by two sets of nerves, and it should be under- stood that wherever two nerve areas approach each other they overlap. The dotted blue area of small sciatic indicates that the nerve comes from the posterior part of anterior primary divisions of sacral nerves, but it supplies a flexor area. The area of the perforating cutaneous nerve is left uneoloured, because its true nature is uncertain. Dark shading—Posterior primary divisions. The numbers and initial letters refer to the nerve roots from which the nerves are derived.

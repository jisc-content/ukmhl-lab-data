SUBCLA VIAN laver of deep fascia, and by the scalenus anticus. The phrenic nerve—which, in consequence of its oblique course downwards and inwards, crosses a portion of both the first and second part of the subclavian—is separated from the second portion by the scalenus anticus muscle as is also the subclavian vein which courses on a somewhat lower plane. Behind the artery are the apex of the pleura and lung, and a portion of the scalenus medius; also the structure known as Sibson's fascia. Above is the brachial plexus. Below are the pleura and luug. One branch only—the superior intercostal—is. as a rule, given off from this portion of the subclavian; occasionally the posterior scapular artery arises from it. THE THIRD PORTION OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY The third portion of the subclavian artery extends from the outer margin of the scalenus anticus muscle, downwards and outwards to the outer border of the Fig. 341.—Tin-: Right Subclavian Artery. Subscapular and two circumflex arteries first rib. It is more superficial than either the first or second portions; it is in rela- tion with less important structures, and as a rule gives off no branch, and for these reasons is the part selected when practicable for the application of a ligature. It is the longest of the three portions of the subclavian artery, and lies in a triangle—the subclavian triangle—bounded by the sterno-mastoid, the omo-hyoid, and the clavicle. Relations.— In front it is covered by the skin, superficial fascia, platysma. cla- vicular branches of the descending portion of the superficial cervical plexus of nerves; anterior layer of deep fascia which descends from the omo-hyoid to the clavicle; and the posterior layer of deep fascia which descends from the omo-hyoid to the first rib and is prolonged inwards over the scalenus anticus and phrenic nerve. Between the two layers of fascia is a variable amount of cellular tissue and fat, and

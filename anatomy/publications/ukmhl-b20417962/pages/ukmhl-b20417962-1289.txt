1209 SECTION XI VESTIGIAL AND ABNORMAL STRUCTURES By ARTHUR ROBINSON, M.D., M.R.C.S. LECTURER ON ANATOMY IN THE MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL MEDICAL SCHOOL; EXAMINER IN ANATOMY FOR THE CON- JOINT BOARD OF ENGLAND The vestigial structures met with in the human body may be classified in two groups:— (1) Remnants of organs which played an important part during foetal life. (2) Structures which appear regularly in the human body, but which possess little or no function, being-merely vestiges of organs which, are much better devel- oped in some of mankind's ancestors. The abnormal structures which occasionally appear in the human subject are produced by retardation or excess of ordinary developmental processes, by the non- union of parts which usually fuse together, by the fusion of parts which usually remain separate, or the formation of organs not usually developed in man, but which are, however, frequently met with in some of his more or less remote ances- tors; organs of the latter class are of atavistic nature, that is, they are due to a ' reappearance of a more primitive organisation, or a reversion to a primary state.' THE SKELETON THE SKULL The epipteric bone.—This term was applied by Professor Flower to a small bone occasionally found at the bottom of the temporal fossa, separating the great wing of the sphenoid from the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone. It is of the nature of a Wormian bone, and is due to the appearance of a centre of ossifica- tion in the region usually occupied by a portion of the parietal bone or the great wing of the sphenoid. The interparietal bone, or os Incae, and the praeinterparietal bone.—The posterior section of the occipital bone, the squama occipitalis, is usually developed from at least three pairs of centres, which are superposed. As a rule, each pair of centres soon fuses into a single nucleus of ossification, and the three segments of bone formed from the three pairs of centres fuse together to complete the squama occipitalis. Occasionally, however, the two upper segments may unite, but remain separate from the lower segment, and then, in the adult, a bone is found lying between the

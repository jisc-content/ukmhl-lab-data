THE VEINS 604 subclavian and innominate arteries, to its junction with the left vein behind the first costal cartilage close to the sternum. Relations.—In front (fig. 327) are the origins of the sterno-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscles, the clavicle, the first costal cartilage, and the remains of the thymus gland. Behind are the pleura and lung. To the right are the right pleura and lung, and the phrenic nerve.

The left innominate vein (fig. 381a) measures two and a half to three inches in length (6-7 cm.), and extends from its origin behind the sternal end of the left clavicle obliquely across the three main branches of the arch of the aorta to unite with the right innominate vein at the lower border of the cartilage of the first rib close to the sternum to form the vena cava superior. In this course it runs from left to right with an inclination downwards and slightly backwards. A line drawn obliquely across the upper half of the manubrium of the sternum, from the sterno-

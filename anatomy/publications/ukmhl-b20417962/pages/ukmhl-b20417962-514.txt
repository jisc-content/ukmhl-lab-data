THE MUSCLES 446 movements are the phrenic and those which supply certain of the muscles of the neck. (5) If the head be much thrown back, the two sterno-mastoids may be used to increase the extension. Relations.—Superficially, the deep cervical fascia and integuments, the pla- tysma myoides, external jugular vein, and many of the superficial branches of the cervical plexus, and the glandulse concatenatae; deeply, the rectus capitis anticus major, omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid, the posterior belly of the digastric, the splenius capitis, levator anguli scapulse, and three scalene muscles; the common, external, and internal carotid and subclavian arteries, with several branches of the external carotid, the internal jugular, facial, thyroid, anterior jugular, and other veins; the spinal accessory and hypoglossal nerves, the cervical and upper part of the brachial plexuses with many of their branches, the parotid gland, the lateral lobe of the thyroid gland, and numerous deep cervical lymphatic glands. Variations.—The clavicular origin may extend farther outwards upon the collar hone. Be- sides its insertion into the mastoid process, this head may have an attachment to the superior nuchal line, called the deido-occipital. An extension of the sternal head has been observed arising from the costal cartilages as low as that of the fifth rib. Slips sometimes pass from the upper part of the muscle to the angle of the jaw, the pharynx, the auricle, or the upper attach- ment of the trapezius.

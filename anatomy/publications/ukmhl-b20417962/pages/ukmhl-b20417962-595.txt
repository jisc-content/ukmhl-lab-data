523 AXILLARY (a) The acromial branch or branches pass outwards across the coracoid process, frequently through the deltoid muscle, which they in part supply, to the acromion, where they form, by anastomosing with the anterior and posterior circumflex and suprascapular arteries, the so-called acromial rete, or plexus of vessels on the sur- face of that process. (6) The humeral branch — the descending branch of some authors — runs downwards with the cephalic vein in the interval between the pectoralis major and the deltoid, and, supplying lateral offsets to these muscles and the adjacent integu- ments, anastomoses with the anterior and posterior circumflex arteries. (c) The pectoral branch passes between the pectoralis major and minor mus- Fig. 347.—The Dorsal Scapulae Artery, Right Side. (From a dissection m the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.)

In the female, one or more of these branches which perforate the pectoralis major are often of large size.

The long thoracic artery—also called the external mammary—descends along the lower border of the pectoralis minor, under cover of the pectoralis major, to the walls of the chest. It supplies both pectoral muscles and the serratus

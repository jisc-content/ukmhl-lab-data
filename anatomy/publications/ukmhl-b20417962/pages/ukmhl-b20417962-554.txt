486 THE ARTERIES Branches of the Facial Artery in the Neck The branches of the facial artery in the neck are:—(1) The ascending, or inferior palatine; (2) the tonsillar; (3) the glandular; (4) the muscular; (5) the submental. (1) The ascending, or inferior palatine (figs. 333, 334)—the first branch of the facial, but often a distinct branch of the external carotid—ascends between the Fig. 334.—Scheme of the Right Facial Artery.

One of these branches, the palatine, passes with the levator palati

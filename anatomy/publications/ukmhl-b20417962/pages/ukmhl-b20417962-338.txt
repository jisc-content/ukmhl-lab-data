284 THE MUSCLES found in lower Vertebrata; and the two bellies may sometimes be fairly regarded as distinct muscles, e.g. those of the digastric muscle. In some cases the central tendon may be of some service in preventing the pressure upon subjacent tissues which would occur if the muscle were at this point fleshy and free to thicken as it contracted. For example, it has been suggested that the central tendon of the omo-hyoid prevents that muscle from compressing the great vessels of the neck as it crosses them beneath the sterno-mastoid. In one muscle, the rectus abdominis, several of these tendinous intersections are found. 5. Nerve-supply.—This is of much importance, not only from a medical and surgical point of view, when the paralysis or spasmodic, contraction of individual muscles has to be accounted for, but also because of the light which it throws Fig. 259.—Diagram showing Penniform Muscle, the Peroneus Longus ; and blpenniform, the tibialis posticus. upon the actions of muscles, and the assistance which it sometimes gives us in grouping them. 6. Action.—Most muscles act upon the levers formed by the movable bones and cartilages. It will be convenient, however, first to speak of those which do not act in this manner. When a muscle passes from a fixed point like a bone to a freely movable point such as the under surface of the skin or mucous membrane, it will simply tend to approximate the movable point to the fixed origin. Such muscles are found in abundance in the face, and the azygos uvulae is a good example of one which acts upon mucous membrane. Again, the fibres of many muscles run in parallel curves, which combine to form a curved band or sheet. The first effect of the contraction of such a muscle will be to straighten or flatten out the curve. If this lies over a convex surface, as is usually the case, the action

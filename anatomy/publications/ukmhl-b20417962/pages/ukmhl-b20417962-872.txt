THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 792 (b) The nerves to the flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, and flexor sublimis digitorum arise a little lower down, and pierce the pronator-flexor mass of muscles, to end in the respective members of the group for which they are destined. (c) The anterior interosseous nerve arises from the median at the level of the bicipital tubercle of the radius, and run downwards on the interosseous membrane Fig. 457a.—Dissection of the Left Arm from the Front, Showing Portions of the Ulnar, Median, Musculo-cutaneous, and Muscuxo-spiral Nerves.

It passes under cover of the pronator quadratus, and pierces the deep surface of that muscle. The anterior interosseous nerve also furnishes a twig to the front of the wrist-joint and supplies the flexor profundus digitorum and the flexor longus pollicis. The nerve to the former muscle arises from the anterior interosseous near its commencement and supplies the outer two divisions of the muscle, and communicates within its sub- stance with twigs derived from the ulnar nerve.

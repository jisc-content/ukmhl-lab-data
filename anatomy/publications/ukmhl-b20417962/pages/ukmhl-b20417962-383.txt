EXTENSOR COMMUNIS DIGITORUM 325 tened cylindrical shape, diverge to their respective fingers. Opposite the heads of the metacarpal bones, each tendon gives off fibrous bands to the lateral ligaments of the corresponding metacarpo-phalangeal joint. Upon the first phalanx the tendon expands into a broad aponeurosis which fits closely by its concave anterior surface Fig. 277.â€”Tendons upon the Doesum of the Hand. upon the back of the bone and affords attachment by its lateral margins to other muscles. After passing over the back of the first phalangeal joint, the central portion of this aponeurosis is inserted into the base of the second phalanx, while its lateral portions converge and, passing over the second phalangeal joint, are attached to the back of the base of the ungual phalanx. A transverse band usually unites the

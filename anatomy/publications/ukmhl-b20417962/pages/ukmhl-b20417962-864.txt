THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 784 divides into a number of twigs which spread out after the manner of a fan, and extend, as they approach the middle line, from the chin to the sternum. The upper two or three of these twigs unite, beneath the platysma, with the infra-man di- bular branch of the facial, and thus form loops. From the terminal branches of the nerve numerous twigs pierce the platysma to end in the skin of the front part of the neck. Descending branches.—These are derived from the third and fourth cervical nerves, and arise under cover of the sterno-mastoid. At their commencement they are usually united with the muscular branches destined for the trapezius. They Fig. 454.—Superficial Branches of the Cervical Plexus. (After Hirschfeld aud Leveille.)

(1) The supra-sternal twigs are small, and cross over the clavicular origin of the sterno-mastoid to reach the integument over the upper part of the manu- brium sterni. They also supply the sterno-clavicular joint. (2) The supra- clavicular nerves, of considerable size, cross in front of the middle third of the clavicle under cover of the platysma, and are distributed to the skin, covering the upper part of the pectoralis major as low as the third rib. (3) The supra- acromial branches cross the clavicular insertion of the trapezius and the acromion

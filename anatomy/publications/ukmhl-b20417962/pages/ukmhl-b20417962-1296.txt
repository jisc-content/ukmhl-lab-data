1216 VESTIGIAL AND ABNORMAL STRUCTURES To understand the position in which the majority of additional mammary- organs are found, it must be remembered that in many mammals the mammary glands are developed as thickened ridges of epithelium, which extend from the axilla? to the groin. Subsequently the ridges are broken up into separate patches, each of which is capable of development into a distinct gland. Embryonic mammary ridges have not yet been found in human embryos, but the majority of additional mamma? appear along lines extending from the axilla? to the groins,—that is, along the lines where we should expect the mammary ridges to be formed during embryonic life,—and additional mammary glands or nipples appearing along these lines must be looked upon as of atavistic nature, inasmuch as they are indications of a reversion to a more primitive organisation. By the careful observation of a large number of cases it has been shown that along a line running from the axilla to the groin, on each side, ten mammary glands may be found in the human subject, and of these the normal gland is the sixth. The complete series does not occur in any one case, and more than half the number of accessory mammary organs which have been observed appear below the normal nipple. In addition, however, to atavistic mammary organs appearing along the lines indicated, mammary glands are occasionally found on the thigh, shoulder, neck, and cheek. Such glands are most probably developed in situ by the abnormal modi- fication of cutaneous glands, and in connection with the formation of such abnormal structures it must not be forgotten that all mammary glands are merely modified sebaceous glands.

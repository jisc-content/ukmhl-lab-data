THE LEG 1189 the middle and lower thirds, the most common site of fracture. Behind the internal malleolus, part of the groove for and the tendon of the tibialis posticus can be felt. The head of the fibula can be felt distinctly, but the shaft soon becomes buried amongst muscles till about three inches above the external malleolus, where the bone expands into a large triangular subcutaneous surface. This lies between the peroneus tertius and the other two peronei. The peroneus longus overlaps the brevis, especially in the upper two-thirds of the leg. In the lower third the brevis Fig. 754.—Anastomoses of Tibial Arteries.

Behind the external malleolus these tendons descend to the foot in very close relation to the bone. The shaft of the fibula is placed on a plane posterior to that of the tibia, and curves backwards in a direction reverse to that of the tibia. Muscular prominences.—The space between the tibia and fibula is mainly occupied by the fleshy belly of the tibialis anticus; outside this, and much less prominent, is the narrower extensor longus digitorum; outside this, again, are the peronei longus and brevis.

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 786 the pleura. In its course between the pericardium and pleura it crosses in front of the root of the lung. It then pierces the diaphragm immediately on the left side of the opening for the vena cava inferior, and is distributed to the diaphragm, the branches entering the muscle on its lower surface. On the left side the phrenic nerve passes on to the left side of the so-called transverse portion of the aortic arch, between the latter and the- pleura, and in front of the inferior cervical cardiac branch of the vagus. It then runs downwards between the peri- cardium and the pleura in front of the root of the lung, taking a longer course than on the right side in consequence of the inclination of the heart to the left side, and also on account of the lower level of the left cupola of the diaphragm. It pierces the diaphragm immediately to the left of the attachment of the pericar- dium to that muscle, and is distributed to its abdominal surface in a similar man- ner to the nerve on the right side. Branches.—Minute twigs are supplied (a) to the pleura; and (6) to the peri- cardium. On the right side the nerve communicates with the diaphragmatic plexus of the sympathetic, forming a small ganglion (ganglion diaphragmaticum). BRACHIAL PLEXUS The brachial plexus is formed by the anterior primary divisions of the four lower cervical nerves, the greater part of the first thoracic nerve, and it is usually joined by small communicating twigs from the fourth cervical and second thoracic nerves. The four lower cervical nerves emerge in the interval Fig. 455.—Diagram of the Brachial Plexus. The posterior cord of the plexus is darkly shaded.

The first thoracic nerve, after traversing the intervertebral foramen between the first and second thoracic vertebrae, appears in thje first intercostal space and, after giving off the small first intercostal nerve, crosses the inner margin and upper surface of the first rib obliquely, and joins the eighth cervical nerve. The brachial plexus is divisible into four distinct stages. In the first stage all

636 THE VEINS Tributaries.—The pyloric, the gastric, the cystic (which latter usually enters the right branch), the superior mesenteric, and the splenic. The pyloric vein begins near the pylorus in the lesser curve of the stomach, and, running from left to right with the superior pyloric artery, opens directly into the lower part of the portal vein. It receives branches from the pancreas and duodenum. The gastric or coronary vein runs with the gastric artery at first from right to left, along the lesser curve of the stomach, towards the cardiac end, and then, turning to the right, passes across the spine from left to right to end in the portal trunk a little higher than the pyloric vein (fig. 392). At the cardiac end of the stomach it receives small branches from the oesophagus. Fig. 393.—The Superior Mesenteric Vein. (The colon is turned up, and the small intestines are drawn over to the left side.) Ileo-colic artery VERMIFORM APPENDIX Left colic artery Superior mesen~ teric artery and vein 'asa inleslini tenuis SMALL INTESTINES The cystic vein returns the blood from the gall-bladder. It usually opens into the right branch of the portal vein. The superior mesenteric vein begins in tributaries which correspond with the branches of the superior mesenteric artery. It courses upwards a little, in front and to the right of the artery, passing with that vessel from between the layers of the mesentery in front of the duodenum, and behind the pancreas, where it joins the splenic vein to form the portal trunk. Tributaries.—In addition to the tributaries corresponding to the branches of the superior mesenteric artery—viz. the ileo-colic, right colic, middle colic, and small intestinal veins (fig. 393)—it receives the right gastro-epiploic and the pancreatico-duodenal veins just before its termination in the portal vein.

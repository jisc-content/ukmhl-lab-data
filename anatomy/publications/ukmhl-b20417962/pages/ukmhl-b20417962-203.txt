151 THE FEMUR part, to the anterior crucial ligament. The outer surface of the external condyle presents near the lower and posterior margin a deep groove, which receives the tendon of the popliteus muscle when the leg is flexed. The anterior end of the groove terminates in a pit which gives origin to the popliteus tendon. The groove is surmounted by a tubercle for the external lateral ligament of the knee. The patellar facet is trochlear in shape; its outer portion is more extensive than the inner, corresponding to the disposition of the articular facets on the posterior surface of the patella.

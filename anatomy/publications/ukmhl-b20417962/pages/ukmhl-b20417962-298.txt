244 THE ARTICULATIONS The nerves are derived from the digital branches, or from twigs of the branches of the ulnar to the interosseous muscles. The movements permitted at these joints are: flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction. Flexion is the most free of all, and may be con- tinued until the phalanx is at a right angle with the metacarpal bone. It is on this account that the articular surface of the head of the bone is prolonged so much further on the palmar aspect, and that the synovial sac is here so loose and ample. Extension is the most limited of the movements, and can only be carried to a little beyond the straight line. Abduction and adduction are fairly free, but not so free as flexion. Flexion is associated with adduction, and extension with abduc- tion. This may be proved by opening the hand, when the fingers involuntarily separate as they extend, while in closing the fist they come together again. The free abduction, adduction, and circumduction which are permitted at these joints are due to the fact that the long axes of the articular facets are at right angles to one another.

The head of the metacarpal bone of the thumb differs considerably from the corresponding ends of the metacarpal bones of the fingers. It is less convex, wider from side to side, the palmar edge of the articular surface is raised and irregular, and here on either side of the median line are the two facets for the sesamoid bones. The base of the first phalanx of the thumb, too, is more like the base of the second phalanx of one of the other fingers. The ligaments are:— Lateral. Posterior.

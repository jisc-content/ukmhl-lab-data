711 CORPORA Q UADRIGEMINA the lateral groove of the mesencephalon under cover of the pulvinar. Its long axis is directed transversely. A band of white fibres is prolonged from its outer end into the optic tract. This passes as the hindermost layer of fibres in the optic commissure into the corresponding bundle of the opposite side. It is therefore commissural in nature. It does not contribute any fibres to the optic nerve. The corpus geniculatum externum is a slight elevation at the outer side of the pulvinar. It is directly continuous with the optic tract. The remainder of the mesencephalon is formed by the crura cerebri, each of which is divided into three distinct parts easily recognised in transverse section (fig. Fig. 424.â€”Deep Origin of the Third Nerve. (After Krause.) 424). These are (1) a greyish upper portion, the tegmen ; (2) a band of almost black substance, the substantia nigra ; and (3) a lower white portion, the crusta, which appears at the base of the brain. The tegmen is also marked off superficially from the crusta by two grooves, the oculo-motor and the lateral groove, which may be seen in section to correspond with the inner and outer extremities of the substantia nigra. The oculo-motor groove derives its name from the third or oculo- motor nerve, the filaments of which reach the surface along this furrow. The lateral groove of the mesencephalon is best marked near the upper border of the pons, where it is bounded below by the superficial fibres of the crusta; and above

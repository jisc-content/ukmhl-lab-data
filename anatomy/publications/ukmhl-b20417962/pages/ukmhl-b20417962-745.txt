669 SECTION V THE NERVOUS SYSTEM By H. ST. JOHN BROOKS, M.D., B.Ch., D.Sc, B.A. Revised for Second Edition by AETHUE ROBINSON, M.D., M.E.C.S.England LECTURER ON ANATOMY IN THE MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL MEDICAL SCHOOL; EXAMINER IN ANATOMY FOR THE CONJOINT BOARD OF ENGLAND NEUROLOGY EUROLOGY is that branch of Anatomy which deals with the nervous system. It treats of the brain and spinal cord, constituting the cerebro-spinal axis or central nervous system ; the cranial and spinal nerves, or peripheral nervous system, and the sympathetic system, which is intimately connected with the two former and closely associated with the vessels, viscera, and glands. The study of the nervous system (of the brain in particular) is greatly facilitated by a knowledge of its mode of development and by Comparative Anatomy.

At an early period of embryonic life the cerebro-spinal axis consists simply of a thin walled tube, the neural tube, which becomes enlarged at the cephalic end of the body. Constrictions appear on this enlarged cephalic end, dividing it into three

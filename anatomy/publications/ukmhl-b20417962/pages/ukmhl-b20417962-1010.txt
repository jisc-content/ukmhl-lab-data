THE ORGANS OF CIRCULATION 930 the vena Galeni (right marginal), usually opens below the superior cava, on the septal wall. The cavity of the right auricle is smooth, except upon its anterior wall, and within the appendix, where it is ridged with muscular bands (the musculi pectinati ), which terminate, above, along a ridge, the crista terminalis. The crista terminalis corresponds externally with a sulcus, the sulcus termi- nalis, which runs across the auricle from the front of the superior cava to the left of the inferior cava, and both the groove and the ridge indicate the line of union of the sinus venosus of the foetus with the auricle proper. At the lower part of the posterior wall or septum which divides the two auricles, and just above the orifice of the inferior cava, is a smooth oval depression, the fossa ovalis. It marks the position of the opening in the foetal heart, to be described hereafter; and is bounded by a well-marked rounded edge, the annulus

334 THE MUSCLES MUSCLES OF THE HAND The muscles of the hand proper consist:—first, of a superficial one, which lies upon the palmar fascia; and, secondly, of a deeper set, which may be divided into a central group belonging to the fingers generally, and two other groups, which are associated with the thumb on the radial, and the little finger on the ulnar side of the palm. Superficial Muscle of the Hand PALMARIS BREVIS The palmaris brevis (fig. 280)—named from its position in the palm of the hand, and its small size—is a small quadrilateral sheet.

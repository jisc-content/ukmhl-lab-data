THE SKELETON 56 of the palate bone. The extreme posterior border receives the tuberosity of the palate bone; the groove in front of it forms part of the posterior palatine canal. Anterior to this surface the bone becomes suddenly smooth; between the smooth and rough portions is the maxillary fissure for the reception of the thin maxillary process on the anterior border of the vertical plate of the palate bone. In the angle between this surface and the nasal process is a deep groove converted by the lachrymal and inferior turbinal into the nasal duct. Running backwards from the anterior margin is the inferior turbinated crest which articulates with the lowest turbinal bone. The surface above the crest forms part of the middle meatus, and the surface below belongs to the inferior meatus of the nose, and is directly continuous with the superior surface of the palatine process. Near its anterior border is the orifice of the anterior palatine canal. The inferior or palatine surface is formed by the palatine process and the alveolar border. The palatine process forms the anterior part of the roof of the Fig. 68.—The Left Maxilla.

It is concave, rough, and pitted with foramina for vessels. Where it joins the alveolar border a groove (sometimes a canal) exists for the anterior palatine nerve and posterior palatine vessels. When the bones of opposite sides are placed in apposition the palatine fossa is formed; running outwards from this to the space between the second incisor and canine tooth, the maxillo-premaxillary suture can be detected in young bones. The posterior border articulates with the horizontal process of the palate bone, whilst the median border joins its fellow to form above, a prominent crest upon which the vomer is received.

4 THE SKELETON together by a delicate reticulum of connective tissue; the space containing the marrow is the medullary cavity. The expanded ends of the bone contain a network of cancellous tissue, the spaces being' filled with red marrow. This cancellous tissue differs from that of the foetal bone in that it is arranged in a definite manner accord- ing to the direction of pressure and the tension exerted by muscles. Pressure lines are well shown in the vertebrae. In a vertical section through the centrum of Fig. 2.—A Vertebral Centrum in section to show the Pressure Curves. a vertebra the fibres of the cancellous tissue are seen to be arranged vertically and horizontally ; the vertical fibres are curved with their concavities directed towards the centre of the bone. The horizontal fibres are slightly curved parallel with the upper and lower surfaces, with their convexities towards the centre of the bone. They are not so defined as the vertical set. (Wagstaffe.) The arrangement of the cancelli in individual bones is a consequence of the Fig. 3.—A Diagram to show the Fig. 4.—A Diagram showing Pres- Pressure and Tension Curves of sure and Tension Curves in the Femur.

In the upper end of this bone, the cancellous tissue is arranged in divergent curves. One set springs from the inner wall and spreads into the greater trochanter; a second series of curves crosses this and forms a set of Gothic arches, and is continued into the neck and head; a third set springs from the lower thick wall of the neck and spreads into the upper part of the head, and ends perpen- dicularly in the articular surface mainly along the lines of greatest pressure.

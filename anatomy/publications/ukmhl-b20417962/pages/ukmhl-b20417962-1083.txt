THE DUODENAL FOLD 1003 If the diagram (fig. 562), which shows a transverse section of the abdomen at the level of the foramen of Winslow, be examined, it will be seen that the posterior laver of the gastro-hepatic omentum, the covering of the posterior wall of the stomach, the right layer of the gastro-splenic omentum, and the peritoneum over the pancreas, are all derived from this so-called lesser sac of the peritoneum. If one could imagine the stomach to be once more brought back to its original median position, some such appearance as is shown in fig. 604 would be presented. Fig. 605.—Intestine of Macropus penicillatus. COLON From this it will be seen that the gastro-splenic omentum, the coverings of the stomach, and the gastro-hepatic omentum are all derived from the original meso- gaster, the posterior attachment of which has been shifted considerably to the left. The left margin of the foramen of Winslow will then be seen to be the free anterior or ventral margin of this simple primitive fold. The gastro-splenic omentum.—The spleen develops in the meso-gaster Fig. 606.—Duodenal Fold of Macropus penicillatus. posterior to the stomach, and the gastro-splenic omentum is but a little altered part of the original membrane. This relation of the spleen to the meso-gaster is very admirably demonstrated in some animals (figs. 593, 594, 595, and 601). The duodenal fold is to be seen in the bodies of nearly all mammals below man, excluding those somewhat lower species in which the intestinal tube remains still as a median loop (pages 993, 994).

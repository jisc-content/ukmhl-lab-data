LUMBAR PLEXUSES 803 an hypogastric branch, (a) The iliac branch pierces the internal and external oblique muscles and crosses the crest of the ilium, lying close to the bone. It is directed downwards towards the great trochanter of the femur; some of its twigs reach as far as that prominence, and supply the integuments covering the fore part of the gluteal region, (b) The hypogastric branch continues the direction of the main trunk, and perforates the internal oblique near the anterior superior spine of the ilium. In this part of its course it communicates in a plexiform manner with the ilio-inguinal nerve. It is then directed forwards and inwards under cover of the Fig. 461.â€”Diagram of the Lumbar and Sacral Plexuses. (Modified from Patersou.)

546 THE ARTERIES costal, or else as a common trunk with the left upper bronchial from the front of the thoracic aorta just below the level of the bifurcation of the trachea. It passes outwards on the back of the right bronchus, and is distributed to the bronchi and lung substance. (6) The left upper bronchial arises from the front of the thoracic aorta just below the bifurcation of the trachea, or as a common trunk with Fig. 360.â€”The Arch of the Aorta, the Thoracic Aorta, and the Abdominal Aorta, with the Superior and Inferior Vena Cava and the Innominate and Azygos Veins.

Like the corresponding artery on the right side, the left bronchial arteries run outwards on the left bronchus, and, after dividing and subdividing on the back of the bronchi, supply the bronchi themselves and the lung substance. Small twigs are given off from the bronchial arteries to the bronchial glands and to the oesophagus.

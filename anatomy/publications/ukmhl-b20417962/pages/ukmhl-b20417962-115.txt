69 THE EXTERIOR OF THE SKULL THE EXTERIOR OF THE SKULL The skull, when viewed from above, presents an oval outline; the posterior part is broader than the anterior. The bones seen in this view are the frontal, parietals, and the interparietal portion of the occipital. In a skull of average width the zygomata come into view, but in very broad skulls they are obscured. The sutures of the vertex are:— The metopic, which is, in most skulls, merely a median fissure in the frontal bone just above the glabella ; occasionally it involves the whole length of the bone. It is clue to the persistence of the fissure normally separating the two halves of the bone in the infant. Fig. 79.—The Skull. (Norma lateralis.) The sagittal is situated between the two parietals, and extends from the bregma to the lambda. The coronal lies between the frontal and parietals, and extends from pterion to pterion. The lambdoid is formed by the parietals and interparietal portion of the occi- pital. It extends from asterion to asterion. The occipital suture is only present when tke interparietal exists as a separate element (fig. 35). The more important regions are:— The bregma, which indicates the situation of the anterior fontanelle, and marks the confluence of the coronal, the sagittal, and, when present, the metopic sutures. The lambda, where the sagittal enters the lambdoid suture; it marks the situa- tion of the posterior fontanelle.

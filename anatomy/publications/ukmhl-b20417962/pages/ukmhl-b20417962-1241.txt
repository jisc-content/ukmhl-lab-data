1101 THE FOREARM Soft parts.—Along the outer border descend the brachio-radialis and radial extensors of the carpus, fleshy above, tendinous below. About an inch and a half above the styloid process of the radius, a fleshy swelling directed obliquely down- wards and forwards from behind, across this outer border of the forearm, denotes the extensors of the thumb crossing those of the carpus. Along the inner border is the fleshy mass of the pronator teres and flexors, tin- ulna being covered by the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor profundus. The tendon of the pronator is inserted into the radius a little below its centre—a point of importance in the treatment of fractures, and in amputation. The flexor carpi ulnaris tendon can be felt just above the wrist making for the pisiform bone; and just external to it lies the ulnar artery, about to pass over the anterior annular Fig. 725.—Distribution of Cutaneous Neeves on the Anterior and Posterior Aspects of the Superior Extremity. ligament. The course of the artery is denoted by a line drawn from the front of the internal condyle to the outer edge of the pisiform bone. If it be drawn from the bifurcation of the brachial, this line must in its upper third be made strongly convex inwards, in order to mark the upper part of the artery, here thickly cov- ered by muscles. The line of the ulnar nerve is one drawn from the interval between the internal condyle and the olecranon to the inner side of the ulnar artery just above the wrist. The nerve joins the artery at the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the forearm. The median nerve runs in a line drawn from the inner side of the brachial artery, in the elbow triangle, to a point beneath, or just to the inner side of, the palmaris longus just above the wrist. The radial artery will be marked by a line drawn from the centre of the bend of the elbow (where the brachial artery divides opposite to the neck of the radius) to a point just

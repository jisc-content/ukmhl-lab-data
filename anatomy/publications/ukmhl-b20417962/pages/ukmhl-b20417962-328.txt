274 THE ARTICULATIONS marked fibrous appearance which the ligament has in the sole, and becomes smooth and faceted. In contact with the under surface of the ligament the tendon of the tibialis posticus passes, giving considerable support to the head of the astragalus by assisting the power and protecting the spring of the ligament. The fibres of the ligament run forwards and inwards. The astragalo-scaphoid ligament is a broad, thin, but well-marked layer of fibres which passes from the dorsal and external surfaces of the neck of the astragalus to the whole length of the dorsal surface of the scaphoid. Many of the fibres con- verge to their insertion on the scaphoid. The fibres low down on the outer side blend a little way from their origin with the upper edge of the external calcaneo- scaphoid ligament, and then pass forwards and inwards to the scaphoid; those next above pass obliquely and with a distinct twist over the upper and outer side of the head of the astragalus to the centre of the dorsum of the scaphoid, overlapping fibres from the inner side of the astragalus as well'as some from the anterior liga- ment of the ankle-joint. Synovial membrane.—The astragalo-scaphoid is lined by the same synovial membrane as the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid joint. (ii) The Calcaneo-cuboid Articulation Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Saddle-shaped Arthrodia. The ligaments which unite the bones forming the outer part of the medio-tarsal joint are:— Internal or interosseous calcaneo-cuboid. Dorsal calcaneo-cuboid. Long inferior calcaneo-cuboid. Short inferior calcaneo-cuboid. The internal or interosseous calcaneo-cuboid ligament (fig. 256) is a strong band of fibres attached to the os calcis along the inner part of the non-articular

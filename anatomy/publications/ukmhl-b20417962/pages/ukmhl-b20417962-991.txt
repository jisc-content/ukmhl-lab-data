911 THE LARYNX thyroid cartilage, their tension and position varying under muscular action. The cords are pearly white in appearance, and present flattened surfaces where they face each other internally, with a free sharp edge above. It is this edge which is thrown into vibrations during phonation. They are, according to Testut, about four-fifths to one inch long (20 to 24 mm.), in the male, and three- to four-fifths of an inch (15 to 20 mm.) in length, in the female.

When observed during life, the rima glottidis is seen to vary very considerably. On inspiration the vocal cords, whilst almost touching in front, are separated behind from a quarter to half an inch (6 to 12 mm.), forming an angle directed outwards, where they terminate in the vocal processes, the glottis presenting a lozenge-shaped appearance.

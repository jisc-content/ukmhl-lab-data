082 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM for a short distance on to the convex surface. The portion on the mesial surface is distinguished as the internal parieto-occipital or internal perpendicular fis- sure. It will be more particularly described with the fissures and convolutions of the inner surface of the hemisphere. The portion which appears on the convex surface is distinguished as the external parieto-occipital fissure. The fissure of Sylvius is situated partly on the base and partly on the external surface of the hemisphere, and is, with the exception of the great longitudinal fis- sure, the most conspicuous sulcus in the brain. It commences at the outer angle of a depression called the vallecula Sylvii, in which the anterior perforated space is situated. It passes outwards and upwards with an inclination backwards, and divides into three branches or limbs, a posterior, an ascending, and an anterior. The posterior limb is by far the largest, and is to be regarded as the continuation of the Fig. 409.—The Fissures and Convolutions of the Cerebrum, viewed from above. orbital MA EGIX SUPERIOR FRONTA L CONVOLUTION MIDDLE FRONTAL CONVOLUTION INFERIOR FRONTAL CONVOLUTION A SC.ENDING FRONTA L CONVOLUTION ASCENDING PARIETAL CONVOLUTION SUPEA- MARGINAL CONVOLUTION SUPERIOR PARI- ETAL LOBULE ANGULAR GYRUS AND POST-PARI- ETAL GYRUS MIDDLE OCCIPITAL CONVOLUTION SUPERIOR OCCIPITAL <i INVOLUTION SUPERIOR FRONTAL FISSURE INFERIOR PR2E- CENTRAL FISSURE SUPERIOR PRJE- CENTRAL FISSURE INTRA- PARIETAL FISSURE CALLOSO- MARGINAL FISSURE SULCUS OC- CIPITALIS ANTERIOR EXTERNAL PARIETO- OCCIPITAL FISSURE TRANSVERSE OCCIPITAL FISSURE SUPERIOR OCCIPITA L FISSURE main fissure; it passes backwards and slightly upwards, separating the temporo- sphenoidal from the frontal and parietal lobes, and finally, taking a more upward direction, ends in the parietal lobe. The ascending limb is short and passes vertically upwards; the inferior frontal convolution arches around it. The anterior limb is about the same length as the ascending; it passes directly forwards into the substance of the inferior frontal convolution. The convolutions which surround the fissure of Sylvius cover in and conceal the central lobe and are therefore called the opereula. The opercula are four in number—the temporal, the fronto-parietal, the frontal, and the orbital. The temporal operculum is formed by the upper temporo-sphenoidal convolution, the fronto-parietal operculum by the lower ends of the ascending frontal and parietal convolutions and the posterior end of the inferior frontal convolution.

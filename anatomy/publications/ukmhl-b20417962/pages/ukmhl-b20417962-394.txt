THE MUSCLES 336 arise have been retracted, whereas the origins of the interossei are practically fixed. The first and second lumbricales will act feebly as abductors of the index and middle fingers; the third and fourth as adductors of the ring and little fingers. They will also have some influence, together with the interossei, upon the aponeuroses of the extensor communis digitorum tendons in binding them down upon the first phalanges.

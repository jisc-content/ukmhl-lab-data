141 THE HIP-BONE _ The tuberosity is that portion of the ischium which supports the body in the sitting posture. It is divided into an anterior and a posterior part by a transverse line, the posterior portion is subdivided by an oblique ridge into an upper and outer part for the semimembranosus, and a lower and inner part for the common tendon of the biceps and the semitendinosus. The anterior portion is separated into an inner and outer section by an antero-posterior line, the outer part gives origin to the posterior part of the adductor magnus, and the inner part serve's for Fig. 15-2.—The Left Hip-bone.

The outer hp is occupied by the quadratus femoris muscle, and the surface adjacent to this is occupied by the adductor magnus. The surfaces thin away to a sharp margin, which forms part of the boundary of the obturator foramen. . a ne ramus of the ischium is a continuation of the tuberosity running; upwards to join the descending ramus of the pubes, to complete the obturator foramen. The outer surface of the ramus gives origin to the adductor magnus and the obturator

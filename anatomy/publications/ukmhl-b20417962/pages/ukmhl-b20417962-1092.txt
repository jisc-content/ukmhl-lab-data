They are very distinct when the organ is congested. The renal lymphatics may be divided into two sets, capsular and parenchymatous. They terminate in a series of glands lying with the renal vessels in the subperitoneal tissue, and their contents are ultimately conveyed into the receptaculum chyli. Nerves.—The nerves form a plexus accompanying the vessels, and are derived Fig. 614.—Scheme of Tubules and Vessels of tile Kidney. mainly from the sympathetic through the solar and aortic plexuses, and the splanch- nics. They communicate with the spermatic plexuses. Some filaments have also been traced from the pneumogastrics. Varieties.—The principal variations of the kidney are as follows:—■ 1. In form.—disproportionate increase of one or other diameter, producing the long, globular, triangular, and discoid types. 2. In size.—Inequality; one being small, the other compensatingly large. 3. In number.—The organ may be single, then usually occupying its ordinary

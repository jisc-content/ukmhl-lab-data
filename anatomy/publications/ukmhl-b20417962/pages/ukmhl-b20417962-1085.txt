THOMAS'S HOSPITAL ; PROFESSOR OF ANATOMY IN THE ROYAL ACADEMY ; EXAMINER IN SURGERY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON AND ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND THE KIDNEYS THE fundamental elements of the urinary apparatus are the kidneys—two glandular organs situated in the loins behind the peritoneum, each of which is provided with a duet—the ureter—for the passage of the secretion to a reservoir—the bladder—by which it is periodically expelled from the body through a tube of outlet—the urethra.

FORAMEN MAGNUM ^7 The basi-occipital is a quadrilateral plate of bone. Its superior surface is concave for the medulla oblongata. Interiorly it is rough, and presents the pharyngeal tubercle, to which the median portion of the fibrous bag of the pharynx is attached. In front of the tubercle near the anterior end of the bone there is Fig. 32.—Cerebral Surface of the Occipital, showing an Occasional Disposition of the Channels. often a shallow fossa, which originally received the primitive anterior extremity of the foregut. The rectus capitis anticus major and minor muscles are inserted into this surface. Anteriorly the basi-occipital is, in the adult, ankylosed to the basi- sphenoid. Posteriorly it has a smooth, rounded, narrow, concave border forming the anterior boundary of the foramen magnum. Fig. 33.—The Foramen Magnum at the Sixth Year. The extremities of this border enlarge to join the ex-occipitals, and form the anterior extremities of the condyles. The lateral borders are rough below, and articulate with the inferior borders of the petrosals. Above they are grooved for the inferior petrosal sinus. The foramen magnum is oval in shape, with its major axis in the long axis of

CRANIO-CEREBRA L TOPOGRAPH 1' 1089 664) runs upwards for about an inch just behind the termination of the coronal suture, or two inches behind the external angular process. To indicate the fissure of Sylvius, a line should be drawn from a point corresponding to the pterion (p. 1081, fig. 659) backwards, at first gently and then more abruptly up- wards, to one three-quarters of an inch below the parietal eminence. The ascending limb will start from a point two inches behind and slightly above the external angular process, and more obliquely forwards and upwards for about an inch. Fissure of Rolando.—This most important fissure, around which the motor area is grouped, runs downwards and forwards, separating the frontal and parietal lobes between the following points: The upper end of the fissure, the upper Rolandic point, will be found about half an inch behind the centre of the sagittal Fig. 665.—Drawing of a Cast of the Head of an Adult Male. (Prepared by Professor Cunningham to illustrate ciauio-eerebral topography.) line (p. 1090)—a line drawn from just below the glabella to the external occipital protuberance. On the skull, this upper Rolandic point will be nearly two inches behind the bregma. The lower extremity of the fissure, inferior Rolandic point, would be about half an inch above the Sylvian line and one inch behind the Sylvian point (fig. 666). Owing to the obliquity of the fissure of Rolando, this lower point will be nearer the coronal suture than the upper, being distant from it about one inch. A line drawn between the upper and lower Rolandic points (the Rolandic line) will give the direction of the fissure of Rolando with sufficient accu- racy, when the two genua, the upper concave and the lower convex forwards (fig. 664) are allowed for. The Rolandic line forms with the sagittal line an an^le anteriorly of 65° to 70°; if prolonged downwards and forwards to the zygoma, the line would reach this process about its centre (Le Fort). 69

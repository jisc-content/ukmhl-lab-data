THE KNEE-JOINT 261 some slight amount of rotation in the bent position. These movements are not so simple as the corresponding ones at the elbow, for the knee is not a simple hinge joint. The rotation inwards and outwards are movements of the tibia with the fibula upon the condyles of the femur. The knee differs from a true hinge joint like the elbow or ankle, in the following particulars:— 1. The points of contact of the femur with the tibia are constantly changing. Fig. 250.—The Lateral Ligaments of the Knee in Flexion and Extension. Thus, in the flexed position, the hinder part of the articular surface of the tibia is in contact with the rounded back part of the condyles; in the semiflexed position the middle parts of the tibial facets articulate with the anterior rounded part of the condyles; while in the fully extended position the anterior and middle parts of the tibial facets are in contact with the anterior flattened portion of the condyles. So with the patella: in extreme flexion the inner articular facet rests on the outer part

186 THE A R TICULA TIOXS The transverse ligament (figs. 195, 196, and 198) is one of the most important structures in the body, for on its integrity and that of the check ligaments our lives largely depend. It is a thick and very strong band, as dense and closely woven as fibro-cartilage, about a quarter of an inch (6 mm.) deep at the sides, and somewhat more in the middle line. Attached at each end to a tubercle on the inner side of the lateral mass of the atlas, it crosses the ring of this bone in a curved manner, so as to have the concavity forward; thus dividing the ring into a smaller anterior por- tion for the odontoid process, and a larger posterior part for the spinal cord and its membranes, and the spinal accessory nerves. It is flattened from before backwards, being smooth in front, and covered by synovial membrane to allow it to glide freely over the posterior facet of the odontoid process. Where it is attached to the atlas Fig. 195.â€”Vertical Anteroposterior Section of Spinal Column through Median Line, showing Ligaments. it is smooth and well rounded off to provide an easy floor of communication between the transverso-odontoid and occipito-atlantal joints. To its posterior surface is added, in the middle line, a strong fasciculus of vertical fibres, passing upwards from the root of the odontoid process to the basilar border of the foramen magnum on its cranial aspect. Some of these fibres are derived from the transverse ligament. These vertical fibres give the transverse ligament a cruciform appearance; hence the name, the crucial ligament (figs. 195 and 198) applied to the whole. The atlanto-odontoid capsular ligament (fig. 196) is a tough, loose mem- brane, completely surrounding the apposed articular surfaces of the atlas and odontoid process. At the odontoid process it blends above with the front of the

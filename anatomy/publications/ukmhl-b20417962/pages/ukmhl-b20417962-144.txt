94 THE SKELETON The frontal consists of two bones separated by a median vertical (metopic) suture. Tlie frontal eminence is very conspicuous, but the superciliary ridges and frontal sinuses are wanting. The nasal spine, which later becomes oue of the most conspicuous features of this bone, is absent. There is no temporal ridge. The parietal is simply a quadrilateral lamina of bone, concave on its inner and convex on the Fig. 103.—The Temporal Bone at Birth. (Outer view.)

The parietal eminence, which indicates the spot in which the ossification of the bone commenced, is large and conspicuous. The grooves for blood-sinuses, as in other cranial bones, are absent. Each angle of the parietal is in relation with a fontanelle. As in the adult, the anterior inferior angle of the bone is prolonged downwards towards the ali-sphenoid. The ethmoid consists of two lateral portions separated by the still cartilaginous ethino- Fig. 105.—The Frontal at Birth. vomerine plate. The ethmoid cells are represented by shallow depressions, and the uncinate pro- cess is undeveloped. The sphenoidal turbinals are two small triangular pieces of bone lying in the perichondrium on each side of the ethmo-vomeriue plate near its junction with the ]ire-sphenoid.

THE SKELETON 138 The phalanges of the second row are shorter than those of the first row. Their bases present two shallow pits, separated by a ridge. The terminal, third, or ungual phalanges have an expanded shaft for the sup- port of the nail. The bases are identical in shape with those of the second row. Ossification.—Each phalanx-ossifies from two centres: one for the shaft, which is deposited between the eighth and tenth weeks; and a nucleus for the epiphysis at Fig. 150.—Ossification of the Metacarpals and Phalanges. the proximal end, which appears between the third and fifth years. Consolidation begins at the seventeenth, and is complete by the eighteenth year. The ossification of the terminal phalanx is peculiar. Like the other phalanges it has a nucleus for the shaft and a secondary nucleus for the epiphysis; but the centre for the shaft appears at the tip of the phalanx; whereas in the other pha- langes the earthy matter is deposited in the middle of the shaft. THE HIP-BONE The hip-bone (innominate bone) is of irregular shape, resembling somewhat the blade of a screw propeller. It consists of three parts, which, though separate in early life, are, in the adult, firmly ankylosed. The three parts meet together at the cotyloid cavity or acetabulum. They are named ilium, ischium, and pubes. The ilium is the upper expanded portion; it articulates with the sacrum, and forms the upper two-fifths of the acetabulum. The ischium is the lowest part of the bone; it forms the posterior and inferior two-fifths of the acetabulum, and assists the pubes to form the obturator foramen. The pubes forms the anterior fifth of the acetabulum, completes the obturator foramen, and stretches towards the median line to meet with the opposite pubes to form a symphysis. Each part requires separate consideration.

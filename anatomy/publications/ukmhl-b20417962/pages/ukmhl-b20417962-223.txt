171 THE METATARSUS Blood-supply.—The nutrient artery enters on the inner (tibial) side of the shaft near its middle: it is directed towards the base. The FOURTH metatarsal has a somewhat quadrilateral terminal facet for the cuboid bone. On its inner (tibial) side it has a large facet for the third metatarsal: the posterior part of this is occasionally marked off for the external Fig. 185.—The Third (Left) Metatarsal. FACETS FOR SECOND METATARSAL TIBIAL OR INNER SIDE FACETS FOR SECOND METATARSAL FIBULAR OR OUTER SIDE FACET FOR FOURTH METATARSAL Fig. 186.—The Fourth (Left) Metatarsal. FACET FOR THIRD METATARSAL TIBIAL OR INNER SIDE FACET FOR THIRD METATARSAL FACET FOR EXTERNAL CUNEIFORM FIBULAR OR OUTER SIDE FACET FOR FIFTH METATARSAL cuneiform, but this is far from constant. When this cuneiform facet is present, the facet extends to the base of the bone. When absent, the surface is rough for ligaments. The outer (fibular) side has a single facet for the fifth metatarsal. Muscles.—Adductor hallucis; second plantar interosseous; third and fourth dorsal interosseous.

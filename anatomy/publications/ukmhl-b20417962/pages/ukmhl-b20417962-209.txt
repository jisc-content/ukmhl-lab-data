TIBIA AND FIBULA Vol border at the junction of the upper and middle thirds, and is directed downwards. The head of the bone receives numerous branches from the inferior articular arteries of the popliteal, and the recurrent branches of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. The lower extremity receives twigs from the posterior and anterior tibial, the anterior peroneal, and internal malleolar arteries. Fig. 165.—The Tibia and Fibula at the Sixteenth Yeae. APPEARS AT BIRTH ; UNITES AT TWENTY-ONE ; BUT IS SOMETIMES DELAYED TO TWENTY-FIVE APPEARS AT THE FIFTH YEAR ; UNITES AT TWENTY-TWO APPEARS AT SECOND YEAR; UNITES AT THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR APPEARS AT THE SECOND YEAR; UNITES AT TWENTY Ossification.—The centre for the shaft of the tibia appears in the eighth week of intra-uterine life. Towards the end of the ninth month, a small earthy nucleus appears in the cartilaginous head of the tibia. The nucleus for the lower ex- trehiity appears in the second year, and unites with the shaft at eighteen. The epiphysis for the head of the bone is one of the last to unite with its shaft; tins event usually occurs about the twenty-first year, but may be delayed until twenty- five. The tubercle of the tibia is usually ossified from the epiphysis; occasionally it has an independent nucleus.

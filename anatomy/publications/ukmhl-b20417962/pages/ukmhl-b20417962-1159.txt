1079 APPENDAGES OF THE SKIN formed below by a layer of cells which enclose and crown the papilla. Downy hairs are devoid of medulla. The cortex consists of a layer of fusiform cells elongated in the direction of the hair, and these, like the medullary cells, are nucleated and contain pigmentary granules. The epidermis or cuticle is a layer of scaly epithelial cells, arranged like the tiles of a roof, but with the overlapping edges directed upwards. Owing to this peculiar imbrication the edges of the cells of the buried part of the shaft may become reversed when the hair is pulled out of its follicle, and may then present a deceptive appearance like that of fusiform fibres rolled spirally around a stem. As the shaft structures approach the papilla they gradually change their char- acter. The bulb itself consists of an inner layer of prismatic cells lying directly in contact with the dermic papilla, and representing the stratum basilare of the epidermis; a middle layer of polyhedral cells like those of the stratum Malpighii, and an outer layer of keratinising cells corresponding to the stratum granulosum, but devoid of eleidin. The papilla is a cone of connective tissue into the centre of which is prolonged a vascular loop from the subcutaneous plexus. Nerves are not seen in the papilla, but fine twigs have been traced into the deeper part of the follicular wall, there losing their myelin and forming terminal fibrils, some longitudinally, some circu- larly arranged, outside the hyalin layer. The special tactile hairs of the lower animals present a more complex nervous and vascular apparatus, but these are not represented in man.

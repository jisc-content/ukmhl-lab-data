THE SKELETON 124 terminates inferiorly in front of the styloid process ; throughout the greater part of its extent it is rounded, and affords origin to the flexor profundus digitorum; in its lower fourth it is rough and prominent for the pronator quadratics. The posterior border extends from the tubercle, near the tip of the olecranon, to the back part of the styloid process. The upper three-fourths gives attachment to an aponeurosis, from which the flexor and extensor earpi ulnaris and Wye flexor profundus digitorum muscles arise. Fig. 130.—The Left Ulna and Kadius.

The upper three-fourths gives origin to the flexor profundus digitorum, the lower fourth to the pronator quadratics; the upper'limit of the surface for the pronator is sometimes indicated by an oblique ridge. The internal surface is bounded by the anterior and posterior borders. The upper three-fourths is occupied by the flexor profundus digitorum,; the remainder is subcutaneous. The posterior surface lies between the interosseous

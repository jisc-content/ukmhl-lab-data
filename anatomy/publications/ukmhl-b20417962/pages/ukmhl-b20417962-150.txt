100 THE SKELETON The seventh rib and its costal cartilage give attachment to the following muscles :— Internal intercostals (sixth and seventh). External oblique abdominis. External intercostals (sixth and seventh). Rectus abdominis (costal cartilage). Levatores costarum (seventh). Triangularis sterni (costal cartilage). Infracostal (when present). Serratus magnus. Diaphragm. Ilio-eostalis, or sacro-lumbalis. Transversalis. Musculus accessorius. Longissimus dorsi. It gives attachment to the following ligaments :— Anterior costo-vertebral or costo- Superior costo-transverse. central (stellate). Posterior costo-transverse (rhomboid). Middle costo-transverse (interosseous). The interarticular. The capsular. Fig. 109.—Fiest and Second Eibs. Blood-supply.—The ribs are very vascular and derive numerous branches from the intercostal arteries. The branches in the shaft run towards the rib-head. Those of the head and neck take a contrary direction, and run, as a rule, towards the shaft. In the neighbourhood of the tuberosity the vessels seem to run in any direction. Peculiar ribs.—Several of the ribs differ in man}' particulars from this general description. They are the first, second, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth. The first rib is the broadest and most sharply curved. The head is small, and, as a rule, is furnished with only one articular facet. The tubercle is large and prominent, the neck narrow. The shaft is broad, has no angle, and is curved around a vertical axis only. The upper surface presents two shallow grooves separated near the inner border by a rough surface (Lisfranc's or Scalene tubercle)

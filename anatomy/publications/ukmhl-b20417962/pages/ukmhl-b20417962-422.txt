THE MUSCLES 360 shaped fleshy expansion, which ends in short tendinous fibres blending with those of the adductor longus and adductor magnus. Nerve-supply.—From the third and fourth nerves of the lumbar plexus by the superficial branch of the obturator nerve, which sends filaments to the anterior surface of the muscle near the lower part of its upper border. Sometimes, how- ever, it derives its nerve-supply from the deeper division of the obturator nerve, and in that case the nerves enter the muscle from behind. Fig. 290.—The Deep Muscles of the Back of the Thigh. Gluteus minimus Obturator externus Gluteus maximus VaBtus externus Short head of biceps Crureus Tendon of biceps Obturator internus Adductor magnus Vastus internus Action.—Like the preceding, it is an adductor and rotator outwards of the femur, but it will not assist so powerfully in flexion. Relations.—In front, the pectineus, adductor longus, the profunda vessels, and superficial branch of the obturator nerve; behind, the obturator externus and adductor magnus, and the deep branch of the obturator nerve. Variations.—It is sometimes divided into an upper and a lower portion. Occasionally it joins above with the obturator externus.

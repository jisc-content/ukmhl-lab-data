250 THE ARTICULATIONS convex and its articular face concave and very smooth in adaptation to the head of the bone, which it tightly embraces a little beyond its greatest circumference. It somewhat contracts the aperture of the acetabulum, and retains the head of the femur within its grasp after division of the muscles and capsular ligament. It is covered on both aspects by synovial membrane. Fig. 240.—Hip-joint after dividing the Capsular Ligament and disarticulating the Femur. Ligamentum teres Capsular ligament The synovial membrane lines the capsule and both surfaces of the cotyloid ligament, and passes over the border of the acetabulum to reach and cover the fatty cushion it contains. The part covering the fatty cushion is unusually thick, and is attached round the edges of the rough bony surface on which the cushion rests. The membrane is loosely reflected off this on to the ligamentum teres, along which Fig. 241.—Portions of Ischium and Pubes, showing the Cotyloid Notch and the Ligamentum Teres attached outside the Acetabulum. Transverse ligament Cotyloid ligament Transverse ligament Ligamentum teres attached to ischium outside the acetabulum it is prolonged to the head of the femur; thus the fibres of the round ligament are shut out from the joint cavity. From the capsule the synovial membrane is also reflected below on to the neck of the femur, whence it passes over the retinacula to the margin of the articular cartilage. A fold of synovial membrane on the under aspect of the neck often conveys to the head of the femur a branch of artery—gen- erally a branch of the internal circumflex.

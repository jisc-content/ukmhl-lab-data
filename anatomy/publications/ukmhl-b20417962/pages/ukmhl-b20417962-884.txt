804 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM nerve in a plexiform manner. It pierces the internal oblique a little in front of the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and runs forwards under cover of the aponeu- rosis of the external oblique immediately above Poupart's ligament, enters the lower part of the inguinal canal and reaches the external abdominal ring. It then traverses the ring and divides into its terminal branches, which are distributed to | the skin covering the upper part of the adductor longus, the integuments of the' scrotum in the male, and of the labium majus in the female. (3) The genito-crural nerve arises from the first and second lumbar nerve by i two roots which pass forwards and downwards through the fibres of the psoas, and unite to form a single trunk. The nerve then appears on the surface of the psoas Fig. 462.â€”Branches of the Lumbar and Sacral Plexus viewed from before. (After Hirschfeld and Leveille.)

After being crossed by the ureter it reaches the outer side of the external iliac artery, where it divides into a genital and a crural branch. (a) The genital branch accompanies the spermatic vessels through the inguinal canal, and, emerging from the external abdominal ring, pierces the internal sper- matic fascia, and is distributed to the cremaster muscle. In the female this branch is rudimentary and accompanies the round ligament. (b) The crural branch is carried downwards in front of the external iliac and femoral artery into the external compartment of the femoral sheath. It pierces the femoral sheath and becomes subcutaneous about two inches below Poupart's liga-

THE SKELETON 6 The laminae are broad plates of bone continuous with the pedicles; each lamina meets its fellow dorsally to complete the neural arch, and conjointly form the spinous process. The superior borders of the laminae are rough for the inser- tion of ligamenta subflava. The anterior surface, in its upper part, is smooth where it bounds the neural canal. The lower part is rough for the origin of the Fig. 5.—A Thoeacic Vertebra. (Side view.) DEMI-FACET FOR HEAD OF RIB FACET FOR TUBERCLE TRANSVERSE Pi ligamenta subflava. This rough surface is continuous with the inferior border of the spinous process. The spinous process projects backwards and downwards from the confluent lamina?. To its upper and lower borders the interspinous ligaments are attached; its tip is rounded for the supraspinous ligament. It is mainly a muscular process. Fig. 6.—A Thoracic Vertebra. FACET The articular processes are four in number: two are superior; they spring from the junction of the pedicles with the laminae and have their articular facets directed backwards, with a slightly outward tendency; their anterior surfaces complete the intervertebral foramina; posteriorly their margins give attachment to capsular ligaments. The inferior articular processes are slightly concave oval facets on the lower and outer angles of the anterior surfaces of the laminae. They are directed forwards and slightly inwards.

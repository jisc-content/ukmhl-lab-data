ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 882 The membranous canal of the cochlea is connected with the saccule by a short canal, canalis reuniens. The two sacs are indirectly connected by means of a small tube, ductus endo- lymphaticus, which leaves the saccule, joins the commencement of a minute canal which passes to the utricle, and descends in the aqueductus vestibuli to terminate in an enlargement, the saccus endolymphaticus.

The membranous ampullae are flattened on their external walls, where they receive vascular and nervous filaments, Fig. 505.—Enlarged Diagrammatic View of Membranous Labyrinth.

65 THE MANDIBLE Its six centres are mainly named according to their position. The mento-Meckelian.—This is deposited in the distal end of Meckel's (mandibular) cartilage, and gives rise to that portion of the bone between the symphysis and the mental foramen. The dentary.—This forms the lower border and outer plate, and supports the teeth, hence its name. Fig. 75.—The Mandible at Birth. The coronoid.—This gives rise to the process of that name. The condyloid.—This forms the condyle and adjacent portion of the neck of the bone. The angular.—This gives rise to the angle of the bone. The splenial.—This centre appears three weeks later than the portions already Fig. 76.—The Skull of an Old Woman Eighty-theee Years Old, to show the Changes in the Mandible and Maxilla. mentioned. It forms the inner plate of the mandible from near the symphysis to the mandibular foramen. The mandibular spine represents the posterior extremity of the splenial. Its line of junction with the dentary is indicated in the adult bone by the mylo-hyoid groove. At birth the mandible is represented by two nearly horizontal troughs of bone 5

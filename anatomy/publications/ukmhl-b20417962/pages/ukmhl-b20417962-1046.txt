966 THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION The fourth part of the duodenum, or second ascending portion, ascends vertically by the left side of the spine. This vertical portion—which is covered entirely in front and partly at the sides by peritoneum—is at least an inch in length (figs. 570, 571, and 572). The end of the duodenum is very firmly fixed in its place by the musculus suspensorius duodeni. This name has been given to a fibrous band that contains, according to Treitz, some plain muscular fibres, and that descends to the Fig. 571.—The Duodenum feom behind.

Mr. Lockwood points out that this band is continued on, after being inserted into the duodenum, between the layers of the mesentery. He suggests the name of the ' suspensory muscle of the duodenum and mesentery,' and says, ' together with the other constituents of the root of the mesentery, it forms a band of con- Fig. 572.—The Fossa Ddodeno-jejunalis.

In connection with the termination of the duodenum may be mentioned the fossa duodeno-jejunalis. It is formed as a pouch behind a fold of peritoneum. This fold runs from the parietal peritoneum, just to the left of the terminal or fourth part of the duodenum, and is attached in a vertical line to the anterior

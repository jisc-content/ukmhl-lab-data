THE SKELETON 134 articular surface for the base of the first phalanx, and is more extensive on the palmar than the dorsal aspect. On its palmar surface the head is grooved for flexor tendons, each corner of the groove being surmounted by a tubercle. The sides of the head are compressed, and each side is occupied by a well-marked fossa. The several metacarpals present distinctive characters. The First is the most Fig. 144.—The Fiest (Left) Metacarpal. peculiar; it is the shortest, and its shaft resembles that of a phalanx. It has a concave palmar surface, and the dorsal surface lacks the bifurcated ridge. The base has a saddle-shaped articular surface for the trapezium, and at its outer (radial) comer presents a tubercle for the insertion of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. The head of the bone presents on its palmar aspect two shallow grooves for the sesamoids in the flexor brevis pollicis. Fig. 145.—The Second (Left) Metacarpal.

Blood-supply.—The nutrient vessel is derived from the princeps pollicis artery: it enters on the ulnar side, and is directed towards the head of the bone.

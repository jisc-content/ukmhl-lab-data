68 THE SKELETON lies parallel with the handle of the malleus. On the inner aspect of the distal extremity of this process is the orbicular tubercle, connected with the process by a narrow neck. Its free surface articulates with the head of the stapes. The orbicular tubercle is separate in early life. The stapes is the innermost ossicle. It has a head directed horizontally out- wards, capped at its outer extremity by a disc resembling the head of the radius. The cup-shaped depression receives the orbicular tubercle of the incus.

LEFT MALLEUS FOSSA FOR INCUS HEAD OF MALLEUS SHORT PROCESS SLENDER PROCESS - HANDLE OR MANUBRIUM LEFT INCUS SHORT PROCESS ANTERIOR CRUS POSTERIOR CRUS ARTICULAR SURFACE FOR MALLEUS LONG PROCESS ORBICULAR TUBERCLE BASE OF STAPES occupies the fenestra ovalis, and like this opening the inferior border is straight, and the superior curved. The base is connected with the head by means of two crura, and a narrow piece of bone called the neck. Of the two crura, the anterior is the shorter and straighter. The crura with the base form a stirrup-shaped arch, of winch the inner margin presents a groove for the reception of the membrane which is stretched across the hollow of the stapes. In the early embryo this hollow is traversed by the stapedial artery. The neck is very short, and receives on its posterior border the tendon of the stapedius muscle.

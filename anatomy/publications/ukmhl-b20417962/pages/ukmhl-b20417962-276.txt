THE ARTICULATIONS 222 reach the clavicle. The suprascapular artery passes over it, and the suprascapular nerve beneath it. Internally, some fibres of the omo-hyoid muscle arise from it. The inferior transverse or spino-glenoid ligament (fig. 223) reaches from the external border of the spine of the scapula to the margin of the glenoid cavity, and so forms a foramen under which the suprascapular vessels and nerve gain the infraspinous fossa. It is usually a weak membranous structure with but few liga- mentous fibres. 3. THE SHOULDER-JOINT Class.—Diarthrosis. Subdivision.—Enarthrodia, Tbe shoulder is one of the most perfect, and most movable of joints, the large upper end of the humerus playing upon the shallow glenoid cavity. Like the hip, it is a ball-and-socket joint. It is retained in position much less by ligaments than by muscles and the effects of atmospheric pressure; and, owing to the looseness of its capsule, as well as to all the other conditions of its construction and position, it is exceedingly liable to be displaced; on tbe other hand, it is sheltered from violence by the two projecting processes—the acromion and coracoid. The ligaments of the shouAder-joint are:— Capsular. Coraco-humeral. Gleno-humeral. Glenoid. The capsular ligament (figs. 222, 223 and 224) is a loose sac, insufficient in itself to maintain the bones in contact. It consists of fairly distinct but not coarse fibres, closely woven together, and directed, some straight, others obliquely, between the two bones, a few circular ones being interwoven amongst them. At the scapula,

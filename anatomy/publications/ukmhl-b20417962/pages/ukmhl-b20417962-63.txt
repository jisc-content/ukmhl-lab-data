THE YERTEBRJE 21 lenticular-shaped cartilage. During the second year a nucleus appears at the tip of the odontoid process; it joins the main mass at the fourth year. An epiphysial meniscus for the inferior and superior surfaces of the centrum of the axis appears about the seventeenth year. As a rule, the superior meniscus is represented by a few earthy granules. Fig. 24.—Immature Atlas. (Third year.) The sixth and seventh vertebrae.—In the cervical vertebrae the pedicles, or anterior extremities of the neural arches, take% much larger share in forming the centrum than is the case with the remaining vertebra?. The sixth, seventh, and possibly other cervical vertebra? present an additional centre on each side of the neural arch for the costal process; it appears before birth.

Sometimes these ribs are of large size. The lumbar vertebrae.—In the lumbar vertebra?, two additional centres make their appearance, about puberty, namely, for the mammillary tubercles on the posterior aspect of each superior articular process. The fifth lumbar occasionally differs in the mode of ossification of its arch; in many skeletons this arch is derived from four nuclei. There is a nucleus on each side for the pedicle, the transverse process, and the superior articular process; and

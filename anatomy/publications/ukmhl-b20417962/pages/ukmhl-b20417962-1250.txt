SURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY 1170 intimate connection with the superficial fascia and skin, is well adapted to protect the parts beneath from pressure. The thenar and hvpothenar muscles are enclosed in two processes, which are thinner so as not to interfere with the contraction of the subjacent muscles. The central part, pointed above at its attachment to the annular ligaments, spreads out fan-like below, and gives off four slips, each of winch bifurcates into two processes, which are attached to the sides of the first phalanx of each finger and into the transverse ligament which ties the heads of the meta- carpal bones together. Transverse fibres pass between the processes into which each of the four slips bifurcates, and thus form the beginning of the theca, which is

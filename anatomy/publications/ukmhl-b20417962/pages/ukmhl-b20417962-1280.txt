1200 SURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY and third metatarsal bones; and between the second and third, and the third and fourth metatarsal bones (fig. 762). Dorsal artery.—The line of this is from the centre of the ankle-joint to the upper part of the first interosseous space. On its inner side is the tendon of the extensor proprius hallucis; on its outer, the innermost tendon of the extensor longus digitorum. It is crossed by the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis. The origin of this muscle should be marked on the outer and fore part of the caleaneum. Cutaneous nerves (figs. 764, 770).—The sites of these, numerous on the dorsum of the foot, are as follows:—The musculo-cutaneous nerve, having perforated the fascia in the lower third of the leg, divides into two chief branches, inner and outer, which supply all the toes save the outer part of the little, and the adjacent sides of the first and second. The anterior tibial becomes cutaneous in the first space, and is distributed to the contiguous sides of the above-mentioned toes. The external saphenous nerve runs with its vein below the malleolus, and supplies all the outer border of the foot and the outer side of the little toe. The internal saphenous nerve, coursing with its vein in front of the internal

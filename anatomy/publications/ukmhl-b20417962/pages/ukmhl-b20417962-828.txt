THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 748 the posterior border of the inferior oblique. Near its commencement it gives off the short or motor root to the lenticular ganglion. The third nerve supplies all the orbital muscles, with the exception of the Fig. 443.â€”Deep Origin of the Third Nerve. (After Krause.) 7B external rectus and the superior oblique. It also supplies (through the lenticular ganglion) the ciliary muscle and the circular fibres of the iris (sphincter iridis). In the wall of the cavernous sinus it is connected with the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic and with the ophthalmic division of the fifth. FOURTH OR TROCHLEAR NERVE The fourth or trochlear nerve arises from a column of nerve-cells which is continuous Avith the nucleus of the third nerve. This column of cells is embedded in the central grey matter below the aqueduct, and extends from the level of the interval between the nates and testes to the lower margin of the latter bodies. The nerve-fibres issuing from this elongated nucleus form two or three rounded bundles, which run downwards, backwards, and slightly outwards along the outer side of the nucleus, and then incline inwards to reach the valve of Vieussens, in

THE HUMERUS 119 the musculo-spiral groove. The internal surface lies between the anterior and ulnar borders. The lower halves of the internal and external surfaces afford origin to the brachialis anticus muscle. The internal surface usually presents, about 5 cm. (2") above the ulnar condyle, an elongated rough surface. This is the supracondyloid ridge ; it is occasionally replaced by a prominent spine of bone, the supracondyloid process (fig. 125), from which a band of fibrous tissue Fig. 126. â€”Ossification of the Humerus. UNITES WITH THE SHAFT AT THE TWENTIETH YEAR. THE UPPER EPIPHYSIS IS FORMED BY THE UNION OF THE NUCLEUS FOR THE HEAD, GREATER TUBEROSITY, AND THAT FOR THE LESSER TUBEROSITY. THESE FORM A COMMON EPIPHYSIS BEFORE UNITING WITH THE SHAFT SHAFT BEGINS TO OSSIFY IN THE EIGHTH WEEK OF INTRA-UTERINE LIFE NUCLEUS FOR THE INTERNAL CONDYLE APPEARS AT. FIFTH; FUSES AT THE EIGHTEENTH YEAR NUCLEUS FOR TROCHLEA APPEARS AT THE TENTH YEAR- NUCLEUS FOR EXTERNAL CONDYLE APPEARS AT FOUR- TEENTH YEAR NUCLEUS FOR CAP1TELLUM APPEARS IN THE THIRD YEAR THE CENTRES FOR THE RADIAL CONDYLE, TROCHLEA, ANO CAPITELLUM UNITE TOGETHER AND FORM AN EPIPHYSIS WHICH FUSES WITH THE SHAFT AT THE SEVENTEENTH YEAR extends to the ulnar condyle, forming a ring, transmitting the median nerve and the brachial artery. The nerve is not always accompanied by the artery; in some instances of high division of the brachial the foramen transmits the interosseous artery. The process gives origin to the pronator radii teres, and sometimes affords insertion to a part of the coraco-brachialis. The posterior surface lies between the ulnar and radial borders. It is obliquely divided by the musculo-spiral groove. The surface above the groove

919 THYMUS GLAND It is commonly made up of two elongated, nearly equal pyramidal lobes of a greyish pink colour, which meet each other near the middle line; but they vary in number and are inconstant in size. There may be but a single lobe present, or a third may intervene between the other two. Sometimes the right lobe and sometimes the left lobe is the larger. The thymus body is about two inches (50 mm. ) in length, about one inch and a half (37 mm.) in breadth at its base, and a quarter of an inch (16 mm.) in thickness. Its weight at birth is about half an ounce. Relations.—The thymus body at the period of its fullest development lies Fig. 541.—Thymus Gland in a Child at the Age of Two Years.

It extends upwards as far as the thyroid body covered by the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, completely hiding the trachea and the carotid sheaths. Below, it descends into the superior medias- tinum between the pleural sacs and internal mammary vessels as far as the fourth rib cartilages, and lies behind the sternum, the sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles, and in front of the pericardium and larger vessels. Structure.—A thin areolar capsule invests the lobes of the thymus gland, and extends upwards in the form of two flattened fibrous bands to be attached to each lobe of the thyroid body. These bands are well marked at the period of birth, and seem to act as suspensory ligaments. If the capsule is removed, it is seen to send

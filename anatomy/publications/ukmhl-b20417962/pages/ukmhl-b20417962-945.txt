865 THE EYELIDS The Eyelids The cutaneous and conjunctival surfaces of the lids have already been examined, and the position of the tarsus has been indicated. We have now to ascertain the nature and relations of the tarsus, and describe the other tissues entering into the formation of the eyelids. The skin here is thin, bearing fine hairs, and having small sebaceous and numerous small sweat glands. Immediately beneath it is a loose subcutaneous tissue, destitute of fat, separating the skin from the palpebral part of the orbicularis muscle. The lid-fibres of this muscle arise from the inner palpebral ligament, and course over the whole upper and lower eyelids in a succession of arches, so as to meet again beyond the outer canthus; there they in part join one another, in part are inserted into the outer palpebral ligament. The muscular fibres are arranged m loose bundles, with spaces between them occupied by connective tissue; in the upper lid these connective-tissue fibres may be traced upwards and backwards into the fibrous expansion of the tendon of the levator palpebral superioris. One strong bundle of orbicularis fibres, called the musculus ciliaris Riolani, is found near the edge of the lid, in front of, and behind, the efferent ducts of the Meibomian glands. A central connective tissue separates the orbicularis muscle from the tarsus m the tarsal division of the lids. In the upper lid this is to be regarded as mainly the anterior or fibrous expansion of the tendon of the levator palpebral, which 55

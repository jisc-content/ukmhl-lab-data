302 THE MUSCLES by the suprascapular branch which enters the muscle upon its deep aspect near its upper border. Action.—It assists the deltoid in abducting the arm; it also strengthens the shoulder-joint by resisting the tendency to upward displacement of the head of the humerus, and by drawing the head of the humerus firmly towards the centre of the glenoid cavity. Fig. 268.—Back View of the Scapulae Muscles and Triceps. Relations.—Superficially, the trapezius, deltoid, and coraco-acromial ligament; deeply, the omo-hyoid muscle and capsular ligament, the suprascapular vessels and nerve. 3. INFRA-SPINATUS The infra-spinatus—named from its position below the spine of the scapula— is a thick, fan-shaped sheet. Origin.—(1) The inner two-thirds of the infraspinous fossa; (2) the under surface of the spine of the scapula; (3) the infraspinous fascia, and a thick inter- muscular septum which separates it from the teres minor and major muscles. Insertion.—(1) The middle facet on the greater tuberosity of the humerus; and (2) the capsule of the shoulder-joint.

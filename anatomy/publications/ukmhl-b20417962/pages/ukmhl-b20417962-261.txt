OF THE RIBS WITH VERTEBRA 209 The stellate ligament is overlapped at the spine by the short vertebral ligaments. In the case of the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, each of which articu- lates with one vertebra, the ligament is not quite so distinctly stellate, but even Fig. 214.â€”The Capsular Ligaments of the Costovertebral Joints. in these the ascending fibres reach the vertebra above that with which the rib articulates. The synovial membranes (fig. 216) consist of two closed sacs which do not communicate: one above, and the other below the interarticular ligament. In the case of the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth articulations, there is but one synovial membrane, as these joints have no interarticular ligament. The arterial supply is from the intercostal arteries, the twigs piercing the stellate and capsular ligaments. 14

SURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY 1196 longus digitorum, companion vein, posterior tibial artery, companion vein, posterior tibial nerve, flexor longus hallucis. (D) Tendons at outer ankle.—The tendons of the two peronei, which arise from the fibula between the extensor longus digitorum and flexor longus hallucis, pass behind the external malleolus, the brevis being nearer to the bone (fig. 758). They then pass forwards over the outer surface of the calcaneum, separated by the Fig. 760.—Transverse Section through the Lower Third of the Left Leg, IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE ANKLE-JOINT. (Braune.) Tibialis anticua Extensor propriua hallucis Tibialis posticus Flexor longus digitorum peroneal tubercle when present, and diverge. The brevis—the upper one—passes to the projection at the base of the fifth metatarsal; the longus, lying below the brevis on the calcaneum, winds round the outer border of the foot, grooving the outer border and under surface of the cuboid. Finally, crossing the sole obliquely forwards and inwards, it is attached to the adjacent parts of the internal cuneiform and the back part and under surface of the first metatarsal. While in connection Fig. 761.—Relations of Parts behind the Inner Malleolus. (Heath.) Flexor longus digitorum with the under surface of the cuboid, this tendon is covered in by a sheath from the long plantar ligament, and often contains a sesamoid bone. Annular ligaments and synovial membranes of tendons.—These strap-like bands of deep fascia, which serve to keep the above tendons in position, are three in number, viz.:— (A) External.—This extends from the tip of the external malleolus to the

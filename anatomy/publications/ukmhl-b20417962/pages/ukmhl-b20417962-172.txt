THE SKELETON THE ULNA The ulna is the inner bone of the forearm: it lie? parallel with, but is longer than, the radius. The upper extremity is the thickest and strongest part of the ulna, and is of irregular shape. The superior articular surface is called the greater sigmoid cavity, and receives the trochlea of the humerus; it is transversely con- stricted near its middle. The prominence above the constriction is termed the olecranon, the part below the coronoid process. The olecranon process is the highest part of the ulna; into its upper surface the triceps is inserted, and the anterior margin of this surface affords attachment to the posterior ligament of the elbow. The anterior surface of the olecranon is Fig. â€”UrrEK Exn of Left Ulxa. Outer view.) articular, and forms the upper and back part of the greater sigmoid cavity, and its margins give attachment to ligaments. The posterior surface of this process is triangular, and separated from the skin merely by a bursa. On the inner side there is a tubercle for the origin of thejfexxtr carpi uinaris; and below this a fasci- culus of the internal lateral ligament of the elbow is inserted. The outer side gives attachment to part of the anconeus. The coronoid process forms the lower lip of the greater sigmoid cavity: its upper surface is articular and forms nearly a right angle with the olecranon portion. The anterior edge of the coronoid process is sometimes called the apex. The inferior aspect is rough for the insertion of the hrachialis antim* muscle, and the lower outer angle has a tubercle to which the oblique ligament is attached. The inner edge has a smooth tubercle from which the flexor $uhiliimi& tigiibomm arises; the ridge of bone immediately below this tubercle gives origin to the lesser head of the prmrtfir radri l,cre-<. and below this again the rounded accessory bundle of the flexor hmgus poiUds arises.

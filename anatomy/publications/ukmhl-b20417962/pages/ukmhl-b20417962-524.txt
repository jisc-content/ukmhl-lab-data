THE MUSCLES 456 Inner Group The inner or prevertebral groxhp consists of the greater and lesser rectus capitis anticus and the longus colli. 1. RECTUS CAPITIS ANTICUS MAJOR The rectus capitis anticus major—named from its direction, position, and size—is a thick, irregular, quadrilateral sheet. Origin.—The front of the anterior tubercles of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebras. Fig. 316.—The Muscles of the Fkont of the Neck. Insertion.—A transverse impression upon the under surface of the basilar process of the occipital bone, extending from just behind the pharyngeal tubercle outwards and somewhat forwards. Structure.—Arising by four tendinous teeth, the parallel fleshy fibres run upwards and inwards to be inserted directly upon the occipital bone. An incom- plete tendinous intersection crosses its anterior surface. Nerve-supply.—Internal branches from the first and second cervical nerves enter the upper part of its front surface.

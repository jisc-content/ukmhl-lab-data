961 THE STOMACH (13 mm.). It is the narrowest part of the digestive canal. There is no such special sphincter apparatus at the cardiac end of thcstomach, the oesophagus passing directly into its walls, and becoming wider as it does so. When the stomach is dis- tended the gullet may become a little bent at its junction with the stomach, and the escape of fluid into the oesophagus be thus prevented. The two borders are situated above and below, and run between the two orifices. The upper is known as the lesser curvature, and is about three to five inches long; it is concave along its whole length, except near the pylorus, where it takes part in the antrum pylori (fig. 567). The lower border is called the greater curva- ture, and is convex except near the right extremity just before the formation of the antrum pylori, where there is a slight depression. It is about four times as long as the upper border. Fig. 567.—Anterior Surface of the Stomach, pylorus cardiac orifice ANTRUM PYLORI The two surfaces lie between the two borders. They are of equal extent, and are named the anterior and posterior surfaces. Relations to surrounding parts.—The degree of obliquity of the stomach in its relations to the long axis of the body has been a disputed point, the majority of authorities holding that it lies slightly obliquely from left to right; while a few (Luschka and Lesshaft) maintain that its direction is vertical.

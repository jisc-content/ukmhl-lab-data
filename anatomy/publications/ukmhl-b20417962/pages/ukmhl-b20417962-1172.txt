1092 SURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY THE EYELIDS AND LACHRYMAL APPARATUS The structure of the lids.—The different layers are of much practical impor- tance. (1) The skin is delicate and fatless, and contains pigment, the object of this being to protect the eye from bright light. It helps to explain the ' dark circles' of later life. (2) Areolar tissue. Owing to its looseness and delicacy> Fig. 667.—Scheme of the Facial Artery. Orbicularis palpebrarum muscle Transverse facial artery Zygomaticus minor muscle Zygomaticus major muscle Buccinator muscle Masseteric branch Maaseter muscle Stylo-pliaryngeus muscle Stylo-glossus muscle Ascending palatint branch Tonsillar branch Facial artery \n External carotid artery Posterior belly of digastric muscle Lingual artery Frontal branch of ophthalmic artery Nasal branch of ophthalmic artery Angular artery Levator labii super- ioris et alae nasi muscle • Infraorbital artery i Levator labii super- i'j ioris proprius 1 Lateralis nasi artery Levator auguli oria muscle Artery of septum Superior coronary artery Risorius muscle Inferior coronary artery Mental branch of inferior dental artery Depressor labii inferioris muscle or labial artery Depressor anguli oris muscle Submental artery Branches to submaxillary gland Anterior belly of digastric muscle Mylo-hyoid muscle Hyo-glossus muscle HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE this is very liable to infiltration, as in ascites and erysipelas. (3) Orbicularis. Paralysis of this, the palpebral portion, leads to epiphora, the puncta being no longer kept applied against the eye. (4) Palpebral ligament, reaching from the orbit to the tarsal cartilage. This is usually strong enough to prevent haemorrhage, due to fractured base of skull, becoming subcutaneous. (5) Levator palpebrse. (G) Tarsal cartilage; in reality, densely felted fibrous tissue. (7) Meibomian

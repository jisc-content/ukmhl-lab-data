914 THE ORGANS OF VOICE the trachea is ridged transversely by the rings, which are rounded on their inner surfaces; but it is comparatively smooth externally, where the outer surfaces of the rings are flattened. The first cartilage is broad, and is occasionally united with the cricoid above, or second ring of the trachea below. The last cartilage is likewise broad and strong, and sends a curved beak downwards and backwards at the point of bifurcation of the trachea. It forms an imperfect ring on each side above the commencement of the corresponding bronchus. Two cartilages not uncommonly unite in part, and thus present a bifurcated appearance. The fibres of the trachealis are unstriped, and form a transverse layer at the posterior flattened part of the tube, with an indistinct layer of longitudinal fibres superimposed. The yellow elastic fibres, which exist throughout the entire mucous mem- brane, form a definite and deep layer at the posterior flattened portion of the tube. They are gathered into strong longitudinal flattened bands, especially well seen at the lower part of the trachea, and where the fibres separate to pass into the bronchi. The mucous membrane is smooth and pinkish in colour; it is provided with numerous glands, especially at its hinder part, and is lined by a columnar ciliated epithelium. The arteries are derived from the inferior thyroid. The veins join the thyroid plexuses; and the nerves are supplied by branches from the pneumogastric, the recurrent laryngeal, and sympathetic.

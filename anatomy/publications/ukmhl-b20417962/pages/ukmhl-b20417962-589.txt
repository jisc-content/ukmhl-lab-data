517 INTERNAL MAMMARY then between the pleura and the vena cava superior; and lastly, between the pleura and the pericardium to the diaphragm, where it anastomoses with the other dia- phragmatic arteries. It gives branches both to the pleura and pericardium. (2) The mediastinal or thymic branches come off irregularly from the internal mammary. They are of small size, and supply the connective tissue, fat, and lymphatics in the superior and anterior mediastina and the remains of the thymus gland. (3) The pericardiac branches are distributed to the anterior surface of the pericardium. (4) The sternal branches enter the nutrient foramina in the sternum, and also supply the triangularis stemi. Fig. 344.—Schejie of the Eight Intebnal Mammary Arteby. (Walsham.) (5) The anterior intercostal arteries (fig. 344)—two in each of the five or six upper intercostal spaces—run outwards from the internal mammary artery, along the lower border of the rib above and the upper border of the rib below, and anastomose with the corresponding upper and lower branches of the aortic inter- costals. Each pair of branches sometimes arises by a common trunk from the in- ' ternal mammary, which in this case soon divides into an upper and a lower branch, as above described. They lie at first between the internal intercostal muscles and the pleura; afterwards between the external and internal intercostal muscles. They supply the contiguous muscles, the pectoralis major, and the ribs. (6) The perforating or anterior perforating branches—five or six in number, one corresponding to each of the five or six upper spaces—come off from the front

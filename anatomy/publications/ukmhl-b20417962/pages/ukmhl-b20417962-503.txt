435 ORBICULARIS ORIS fleshy slips from the maxilla and mandible—the musculi incisivi, as they are called—pass outwards and forwards to join the deep surface of the transverse fibres near the corners of the mouth. Nerve-supply.—The buccal and supramaxillary branches of the loAver division of the facial, which enter the facial part of the muscle near its outer border. Action.—(1) To bring together the lips and to oppose all the other muscles which converge upon the mouth, and tend to draw it open in various directions. It thus acts negatively, and prevents the expression of any emotion, as when the lips are pursed up. If the upper fibres alone act, the upper lip will be drawn downwards; if the lower, the lower lip will lie drawn upwards. If the fibres of the labial portion contract strongly, the corners of the mouth are approximated. (2) To shoot out the lips: this will chiefly depend upon the contraction of the facial portion and the musculi incisivi. (3) To press the lips against the teeth: the plane of the muscle being curved, with the concavity against the arches formed by the front teeth, its contraction will carry the food backwards into the oral cavity. Relations.—In front of the labial portion is the bright red skin of the prola- bium; and in front of the facial portion lie the angular and labial series of muscles, together with some subcutaneous fat.

The constriction immediately below the tuberosities is the surgical neck. The shaft is prismatic in its imper third, but flattened below. Three borders and three surfaces may be recognised. The anterior border commences at the Fig. 124.â€”The Left Humerus. (Posterior view.) GROOVE FOR ULNAR NERVE Flexor carpi ulnaris greater tuberosity, as the anterior or outer lip of the bicipital groove, and, passing downwards, skirts the radial side of the coronoid fossa, to become continuous with the ridge separating the capitellum and trochlea, The radial or outer border extends from the posterior border of the greater tuberosity to the radiaT condyle. This border is not well marked in the upper part of the shaft; near the middle it is

489 OCCIPITAL anastomose with the corresponding branches of the opposite side, and with the posterior auricular, and the superficial temporal arteries. Branches of the Occipital Artery The branches of the occipital artery are:—(1) The sterno-mastoid; (2) the posterior meningeal; (3) the auricular; (4) the mastoid; (5) the princeps cervicis; (6) the communicating; (7) the muscular; and (8) the terminal. The sterno- mastoid, posterior meningeal, auricular, and princeps cervicis are the four vessels usually named amongst the above branches.

At times this artery is a distinct branch of the external carotid. The hypoglossal nerve then as a rule loops round it instead of round the occipital. (2) The posterior meningeal branches (fig. 335), one or more in number, are long slender vessels which leave the occipital artery as it crosses the internal jugular vein, and, ascending along that vessel, pass with it through the jugular foramen, and are distributed to the dura mater lining the posterior fossa of the skull.

THE MUSCLES 340 Nerve-supply.—From the outer and inner cords of the brachial plexus (through the sixth cervical nerve), by a branch from the palmar division of the median nerve, which, after passing under the anterior annular ligament, goes upwards and outwards to enter the upper part of the deep aspect of the muscle near its ulnar border. Action.—(1) To abduct, and (2) to flex the first phalanx of the thumb. As the bones of the thumb are in a different plane to those of the fingers, this move- ment will draw the thumb forwards and at the same time slightly inwards. By its Fig. 283.—The Deeper Muscles of the Palm of the Hand. insertion into the aponeurosis of the extensor longus pollicis, this muscle will help (3) to extend the last phalanx of the thumb. Relations.—Superficially, the thenar fascia, and the superficialis volae artery, which usually perforates the muscle; deeply, the outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis and the opponens pollicis. Variations.—As already mentioned, it receives occasional slips from the radial extensors of the carpus and the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. It frequently receives a thin muscular slip from the skin over the trapezium ; it may also be supplemented by the opponens pollicis or a small slip from the styloid process of the radius.

OSSIFICATION—RULES OF EPIPHYSES 3 rate epiphyses, as is the case at the upper end of the femur. Epiphyses, though of no morphological value, seem to follow certain rules, thus:— 1. Those epiphyses which appear last are the first to unite with the shaft. Exception.—The distal epiphysis of the fibula is visible three years before the proximal, but fuses with the shaft much earlier than it. It should be remembered that the proximal end of the fibula in man and many other mammals is vestigial. Fig. 1.—The Tibia and Fibula in section to show the Epiphyses. — EPIPHYSIS — CENTRE OF OSSIFICATION OF EPIPHYSIS — EPIPHYSIAL LINE SHAFT OF FIBULA SHAFT OF TIBIA IN SECTION EPIPHYSIS OF TIBIA EPIPHYSIS OF FIBULA 2. The epiphysis towards which the nutrient artery is directed unites first with the shaft. 3. When a bone has only one epiphysis, the nutrient artery is directed towards the extremity which has no epiphysis. 4. The centres of ossification appear earliest for those epiphyses which bear the largest relative proportion to the shafts of the bones to which they belong. 5. When an epiphysis ossifies from more than one centre, the various nuclei coalesce before the shaft and epiphysis consolidate. On section, the shaft of a foetal long bone is found occupied with red marrow lodged in bony cells which do not present any definite arrangement. In an adult, the central portion of the shaft of a long bone is filled with fat, or marrow, held

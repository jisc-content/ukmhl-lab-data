THE ARTICULATIONS 228 the groove between the trochlea and the condyle. The fibres radiate downwards from this attachment, the anterior passing forwards to be fixed to the rough over- hanging inner edge of the coronoid process; the middle descend less obliquely to a ridge running between the coronoid and olecranon processes, while the posterior pass obliquely backwards to the inner edge of the olecranon just beyond the articular margin. The anterior fibres are the thickest, strongest, and most pronounced. Tlie external portion (fig. 229) is attached above to the lower part of the external condyle, and from this the fibres radiate to their attachment into the outer Fig. 229.â€”External View of the Elbow-joint. Orbicular ligament External lateral ligament Posterior ligament side of the orbicular ligament, a few fibres being prolonged to reach the neck of the radius. The anterior fibres reach further forwards than the posterior do behind. It is strong and well-marked, but less so than the internal portion. The synovial membrane lines the whole of the capsule, and extends into the

THE SKELETON 174 glenoid fossa for the convex head of the corresponding metatarsal, whilst the head has- a trochlear surface for the second phalanx. The phalanges of the second row are stunted, insignificant bones. Their shafts are natter than those of the first row, besides being much shorter. The bases have two depressions, separated by a vertical ridge. The heads present trochlear surfaces for the ungual phalanges. The third, terminal, or ungual phalanges are easily recognised. The bases articulate with the second phalanges; the shafts are expanded to support the nails, and their plantar surfaces are rough where they come into relation with the pulp of the digit. Fig. 190.—The Secondary Ossific Centres of the Foot. THE CENTRES FOR THE HEADS OF THE METATARSALS APPEAR AT THE THIRD YEAR; AND CONSOLIDATE AT THE TWENTIETH YEAR The first phalanx of the hallux gives insertion to the following muscles:— Flexor brevis hallucis; abductor hallucis; transversus pedis; adductor hallucis; extensor brevis digitorum. The first phalanx of second toe : The first and second dorsal interosseous. The first phalanx of third toe : Third dorsal interosseous; first plantar inter- osseous. The first phalanx of fourth toe : Second plantar interosseous; fourth dorsal interosseous. The first phalanx of fifth toe : Third plantar interosseous; flexor brevis minimi digiti; and abductor minimi digiti. The second phalanx of hallux : Flexor longus hallucis; extensor proprius hallucis. The second phalanges of the remaining toes : Extensor longus digitorum; flexor brevis digitorum.

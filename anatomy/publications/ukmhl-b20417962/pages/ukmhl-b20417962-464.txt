THE MUSCLES 398 4. TRIANGULARIS STERN! As the external and internal oblique muscles of the abdomen are represented by the external and internal intercostals in the thorax, so also the transversalis abdominis has its counterpart in the thin stratum of muscular fibre at the sides of the sternum called the triangularis sterni, and the still thinner expansion behind of the infracostales. The triangularis sterni—named from its shape and its connection with the sternum—is a thin, musculo-membranous, triangular sheet, with the apex below and directed internally, while the serrated base is external. Origin.—(1) The side of the lower third of the back of the sternum; (2) the upper and lateral part of the back of the ensiform cartilage; (3) the back of the inner ends of the fifth, sixth, and seventh costal cartilages. Insertion.—The outer ends of the posterior and lower borders of the cartilages of the second or third to the sixth ribs, and occasionally the tips of the ribs also. Structure.—The muscle is membranous at its origin and insertion, and it con- tains many bands of fibrous tissue. Its fibres diverge fanwise, the lower ones being horizontal, and in serial continuation with the upper digitations of the trans- versalis abdominis, while its higher fibres run obliquely up wards and outwards. Nerve-supply.—The upper intercostals, which send filaments to its anterior aspect. Action.—To depress the anterior extremities of the ribs to which it is attached, and so to help in expiration." Relations.—In front, the internal intercostals and internal mammary vessels; behind, the pleura and pericardium.

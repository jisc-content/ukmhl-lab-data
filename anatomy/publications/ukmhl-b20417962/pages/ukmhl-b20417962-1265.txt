1185 THE KNEE fascia lata, passing off from the sides of the patella upwards to the thigh and down- wards to the leg, serve to conduct inflammation away from the joint. Synovial membrane (fig. 751).—To trace this, the largest of the synovial membranes, the finger would start from the top of the patella, where it forms a short cul-de-sac between the quadriceps extensor and the front of the femur, this process reaching about an inch (25 mm.) above the trochlear surface of the femur. At its highest point this cul-de-sac communicates with another synovial bursa-like Fig. 751.—Vertical Section of the Knee-joint in the Antero posterior Direction. (The synovial bursa usually present above the upper synovial cul-de-sac is not shown.) (The bones are somewhat drawn apart.)

Thus, synovial mem- brane will usually be met with two and a half inches (62 mm.) above the trochlear surface or the upper border of the patella when the limb is extended. Flexing the joint draws the membrane down very slightly. During extension, the above pouch is supported by the subcrureus. At the sides the synovial membrane extends up under the vasti for about three inches (75 mm.) on the inner and rather less on the outer side. Traced downwards, the membrane lines the capsule, lateral and posterior ligaments. ' It passes over the greater portion of the crucial ligaments, 75

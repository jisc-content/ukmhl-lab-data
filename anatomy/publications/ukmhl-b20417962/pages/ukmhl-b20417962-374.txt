316 THE MUSCLES The second head arises from the oblique line on the anterior surface of the radius. Insertion.—By four tendons into the middle of the sides of the second pha- langes of the four fingers. - Structure.—The first head arises by short tendinous fibres from the humerus Fig. 273.—Front of the Forearm : Second Layer of Muscles. Biceps Triceps Muscles of first layer Braehialis anticus Flexor Bubliinis digitorum Flexor carpi uluaris Flexor carpi radialis Palinaris longus B rac hi o-radialis Extensor carpi radialis longior Supinator brevis Brachio-radialis Flexor longus pollicis Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis Extensor brevis pollicis and ulna, and from the ligament between them. The second head, which is much smaller, by fleshy fibres which form a thin sheet covering a part of the flexor longus pollicis. Between these two heads the median nerve and the ulnar artery are placed. Converging from these two heads, the fleshy fibres occupy almost the whole breadth of the forearm, but soon divide into a superficial and deep plane. From the former,

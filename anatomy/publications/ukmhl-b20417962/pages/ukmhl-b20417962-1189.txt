If a horizontal line be drawn round the body from before backwards, at the level of the inferior angle of the scapula, while the arms are at the sides, the line would cut the sternum in front between the fourth and fifth ribs, the fifth rib at the nipple line, and the ninth rib at the vertebral column' (Treves). Those most frequently broken are the sixth, seventh, and eighth.

Structures passing through the upper aperture of the thorax.—If a horizontal section is made passing through the manubrium sterni, upper border of the first rib, and upper part of the first thoracic vertebra, the following structures are met with:—(1) In the middle line.

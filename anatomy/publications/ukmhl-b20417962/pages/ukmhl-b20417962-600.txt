THE ARTERIES 528 ■ Behind, it lies successively on the long head of the triceps (from which it is separated by the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery), on the inner head of the triceps, on the insertion of the coraco-brachialis, and thence to its bifurcation on the brachialis anticus muscle. External to the artery is the coraco-brachialis above, and the muscular belly of the biceps below, both of which slightly overlap the vessel, and at the bend of the elbow the tendon of the biceps. The external vena comes is also to its outer side. The median nerve is in close contact with the outer side of the artery in the upper third of its course, but in the middle third crosses the artery obliquely to gain the inner side. Internal to the artery in the upper part of its course are the internal cutaneous and the ulnar nerves; the latter nerve, however, leaves the artery about the origin of the inferior profunda branch, to make, with that vessel, for the internal con- dyle. Lower down, the internal cutaneous nerve also leaves the artery, by piercing the deep fascia. The median nerve is in close contact with the inner side of the artery in its lower third and at the bend of the elbow. The basilic vein is super- ficial to it, and a little to its inner side in the greater part of its course, but separated from it by the deep fascia. The internal vena comes runs along its inner side. The Variations in the Brachial Artery The chief variations in the brachial artery are :—(1) A high division into its terminal branches. The high division may occur at any spot in the normal course of the vessel, but is most common in the upper third of the arm, and least common in the middle third. The two vessels into which the brachial then divides as a rule run parallel to each other to the bend of the

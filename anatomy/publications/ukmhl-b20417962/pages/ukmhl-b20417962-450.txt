THE MUSCLES 386 these two movements they are assisted by the lumbricales. In walking, this move- ment is of great importance, as it keeps the toes straight when the weight of the body rests upon the front part of the foot. When these movements are paralysed, the action of the long and short flexors of the toes is to curl them up, and the ends of the toes are subjected to considerable pressure, which may set up inflammation in the beds of the nails. The special action of the plantar interossei is to adduct the first phalanges of the three outer toes; and of the dorsal interossei to abduct the second, third, and Fig. 296.—Fourth Layer of the Muscles of the Sole. fourth toes from the middle line of the second toe. As the second toe can be abducted from its own middle line in two directions, it of course requires two abductors. Relations.—On the plantar surfaces both sets of interossei are in contact with the muscles of the third layer, and with the external plantar vessels and nerve; on the dorsal surface the dorsal interossei are covered by the tendons of the extensor longus and brevis digitorum. The dorsalis pedis and other perforating arteries pass through the back of the interosseous spaces between the double origins of the dorsal interossei.

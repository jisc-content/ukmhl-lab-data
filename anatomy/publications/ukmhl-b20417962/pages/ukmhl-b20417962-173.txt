THE ULNA 123 A triangular depressed surface, posterior to the sublimis tubercle, gives origin to the upper fibres of the flexor profundus digitorum. To the outer side of the rough surface for the brachialis anticus is a triangular space, the base of which is repre- sented by the lesser sigmoid cavity, which receives the lateral articular surface of the head of the radius; the anterior and posterior margins of this cavity afford attachment to the orbicular ligament. The rest of the triangle is depressed, and gives origin to the supinator brevis. Fig. 129.â€”The Left Ulna and Radius. (Antero-intenial view.

It has three borders and three surfaces. Of the three borders, the outer (or interosseous) is the most marked: it commences at the apex of the triangle from which the supinator brevis arises, be- comes very prominent in the middle of the bone, but is indefinite near its termina- tion; the interosseous membrane is attached to it. The anterior border is directly continuous with the inner edge of the rough surface for the brachialis anticus, and

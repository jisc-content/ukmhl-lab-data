168 THE SKELETON Articulations.—With the scaphoid, middle cuneiform, and the first and second metatarsals. Muscles.—Tibialis anticus and posticus, the peroneus longus, and first dorsal interosseous. Ossification.—A single nucleus, which appears in the course of the third year. The middle cuneiform, the smallest of the three, has its base directed upwards and the sharp border downwards. The posterior concave surface is Fig. 179.—The Left Middle Cuneiform. (Internal surface.) I— FOR INTERNAL CUNEIFORM - FOR SECOND METATARSAL articular for the middle facet of the scaphoid. The anterior, somewhat narrower than the posterior surface, articulates with the base of the second metatarsal. The internal surface has a facet extending along its upper and posterior borders for the Fig. 180.—The Left Middle Cuneiform. (External surface.) OCCASIONAL FACET FOR EXTERNAL CUNEIFORM FOR EXTERNAL CUNEIFORM FOR SCAPHOID internal cuneiform. The external surface has a facet along the posterior border, and occasionally one at the anterior inferior angle for the external cuneiform. Articulations.—With the internal and external cuneiform bones, the scaphoid and the second metatarsal. Ossification.—A single nucleus appears in the fourth year. The external CUNEIFORM has its base directed upwards, and its narrow border downwards. The posterior surface is faceted for the scaphoid; and the anterior, triangular in shape, articulates with the base of the third metatarsal. Fig. 181.—The Left External Cuneiform. (Internal surface.) FOR MIDDLE CUNEIFORM FOR SCAPHOID FOR SECOND METATARSAL. THE CIRCULAR FACET AT THE INFERIOR ANGLE IS FOR THE MIDDLE CUNEI- FORM The internal surface has a large facet, extending along the posterior border, for the middle cuneiform; and on the anterior border, a narrow irregular facet for the outer border of the base of the second metatarsal; and occasionally a small facet at the anterior inferior angle for the middle cuneiform. The outer surface has a broad distinctive facet, near its posterior superior angle, for the cuboid; and at the anterior superior angle there is usually a facet for the inner side of the base of the fourth metatarsal.

SURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY 1146 spines. The five lumbar arise opposite the eleventh and twelfth thoracic spines; and the origins of the five sacral correspond to the first lumbar spines. The dia- gram and table (fig. 705), arranged by Dr. Gowers from anatomical and patho- logical data, show the relations of the origins of the nerves to their exits from the vertebral canal, and the regions supplied by each. Scapula, its muscles and arterial anastomoses.—Amongst the landmarks in the back, the student should be careful to trace the angles and borders of the scapula as far as these are accessible. The upper border is the one most thickly covered. With the hands hanging down, the upper angle corresponds to the upper border of the second rib; the lower angle to the seventh intercostal space; and the root of the spine of the scapula to the interval between the third and fourth tho- racic spines. Fig. 706 shows the chief arteries around the scapula. The anas- tomoses on the acromial process between the suprascapular, acromio-thoracic, and circumflex arteries are not shown. Lumbar fascia.—In the loins, the muscles which fill in the space between the last rib and the crest of the ilium should be carefully noted, owing to the frequency of operations here. When the latissimus dorsi, the oblique, the transversalis, the erector spinae, and quadratus have been described, the lumbar fascia (the posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis), and the three layers into which it divides poste- riorly (fig. 707) should be remembered. Viscera.—Several of these, which can be mapped in behind—viz. the kidneys,

INTERNAL AND MIDDLE CUTANEOUS NERVES 807 cutaneous nerves. They also contain fibres from the second and third lumbar I nerves. The internal cutaneous nerve is directed downwards along the outer side of j the femoral artery, giving off in this situation two or three cutaneous twigs, which I pierce the fascia lata. It then crosses obliquely in front of the femoral artery, at the lower angle of Scarpa's triangle, and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch is the larger. It runs downwards, in front of the i sartorius, under cover of the fascia lata. It pierces the fascia lata about the , middle of the lower third of the thigh, and, after giving twigs to the skin of that region, turns outwards to end in the plexus patellae. The posterior branch runs along the posterior border of the sartorius, and, after giving twigs to the sub- Fig. 464.- LAST THORACIC ILIO-HYPO- GASTRIC -Distribution of Cutaneous Nerves on the Posterior and Anterior Aspects of the Inferior Extremity.

The middle cutaneous nerve usually takes the form of two strong branches, which run a nearly parallel course. One of these branches usually pierces the sartorius, while the other crosses the superficial surface of that muscle; they pierce i the fascia lata a little above the middle of the thigh. They ramify in the super- ficial fascia, supplying the skin of the anterior part of the thigh as far as the knee, where they end in the plexus patellae. The deep branches are six in numberâ€”one cutaneous (the long saphenous) and five muscular. They are arranged in the following order, from within out- wards: the long saphenous nerve, the nerve to the vastus internus, the nerve to the

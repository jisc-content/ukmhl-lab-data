THE PALATE 945 The Tensor Palati—named from its action on the soft palate—is a thin, flat, and narrow sheet. Origin.—(1) The scaphoid fossa at the root of the internal pterygoid plate; (2) the alar spine of the sphenoid; (3) the outer side of the pharyngeal extrem- ity of the Eustachian tube. Insertion.—(1) Into the transverse ridge on the under surface of the horizontal plate of the palate bone; (2) the aponeurosis of the soft palate.

Structure.—Its belly as it descends between the internal pterygoid muscle and the internal pterygoid plate is muscular. On approaching the hamular process it becomes tendinous, and continues so to its insertion. A bursa is interposed between the hamular process and the tendon. The belly of the muscle is at nearly a right angle with its tendon. Nerve-supply.—From the otic ganglion on the mandibular division of the fifth nerve. 60

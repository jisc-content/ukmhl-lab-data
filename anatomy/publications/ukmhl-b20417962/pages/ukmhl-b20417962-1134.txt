1054 THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS assume a pampiniform arrangement around the artery. The right ends in the vena cava, the left in the renal vein. The funicular artery is an offset of the vesical. It joins the round ligament at the internal ring, and divides into ascending and descending branches, the former running backwards in the substance of the ligament as far as the angle of the uterus, where it communicates with the ovarian and uterine; the latter passing with the ligament through the inguinal canal into the labium, there anastomosing with the external pudic. It is accompanied by its vein. The lymphatics (fig. 643) of the uterus and Fallopian tubes form plexuses in the mucous membrane, in the muscular walls, and beneath the peritoneum. Those of the ovary originate in the perifollicular tissue around the Graafian vesicles, and escape at the hilum. The efferent vessels from these three organs may be divided into three groups with intercommunicating territories. (1) The first, including those of the body of the uterus, those of the ovary, and those of the Fallopian tube, unite by the side of the ovarian vessels and run with the veins to terminate in the prevertebral glands in front of the aorta and vena cava; (2) the second, those of the cervix uteri, form two trunks which run along the base of the broad ligament with the uterine vein to end in the pelvic glands which lie beneath the bifurcation of the iliac artery; (3) the third, those of the round ligament, follow this structure and end in the inguinal or lower iliac glands. Here as elsewhere the lymphatics are collateral with the veins. The nerves of the uterus are derived from the third and fourth sacral, the hypogastric plexus of the sympathetic, and from the renal plexus, which also sup- plies the ovaries and oviduct.

1166 SURGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL ANATOMY runs obliquely inwards across the palm, with a marked inclination towards the wrist, and ends at the outer limit of the hypothenar eminence. The third, lowest, and best-marked of the folds starts from the little elevation opposite the cleft between the index and middle fingers, and runs nearly transversely to the ulnar border of the hand, crossing the hypothenar eminence at the upper end of its lower fourth. An unimportant crease, running obliquely from the third to the second fold, gives to these markings the outline of the letter M. The first fold is produced by the adduction of the thumb- the second, mainly by the bending simultaneously Fig. 730.â€”The Deeper Muscles of the Palm of the Hand. of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the first and second fingers; and the third by the flexion of the three inner fingers. The second fold, as it crosses the third metacarpal bone, about corresponds to the lowest part of the superficial palmar arch. The third fold crosses the necks of the metacarpal bones, and indicates pretty nearly the upper limits of the synovial sheaths for the flexor tendons of the three outer fingers. A little way below this fold, the palmar fascia breaks up into its four slips, and midway between the fold and the webs of the fingers lie the metacarpophalangeal joints. Of the transverse folds across the fronts of the

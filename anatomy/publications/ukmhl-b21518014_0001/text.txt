The organisation or structure of man is the object of awa/omy — a science which investigates every distinguishable material condition of the difierent parts that enter into the construction of his frame. Anatomy is a science of observation, and is, in this respect, susceptible of mathematical precision and physical certainty. The vital functions of man are the objects of physiology, which reveals to us the actions of organs, with whose structure anatomy has previously made us acquainted. The science of physiology inquires into the various motions that occm- within the human body, just as anatomy investigates the form of its component parts. All that we know, in fact, concerning material objects, may be resolved into a knowledge of their motions and their forms. As a moral and intellectual being, man is the object of the science of psychology, which contemplates him in the exercise of thought and volition, analyses the operations of his mind and will, and classifies them according to their supremacy. A perfect acquaintance with man necessarily presupposes a combination of all that is taught by these three sciences ; and it is because his anatomy, his physiology, and his moral and intellectual endowments have not been studied by the same class of philosophers, that in the sciences relating to himself so much yet remains to be desired. Anatomy—the immediate object of this work—constitutes the foundation of medicine. In order to discover the precise seat of a defect in some complicated machine, and the means to be adopted for the reparation of its disordered mechanism, it is necessary to be acquainted with the relative importance, and the particular action of all its constituent parts. " The human body," says Bacon, " may be compared, from its complex and delicate organisation, to a musical instrument of the most perfect construction, but exceedingly liable to derangement." And the whole science of medi- cine is therefore reduced to a knowledge of the means by which that har- monious instrument, the human frame, may be so tuned and touched, as to yield correct and pleasing sounds. But since anatomy forms, as it were, the vestibule of medical science, it is of importance, that he who is entering upon its pursuit should fully un- derstand the path he is about to tread ; it is necessary, therefore, to assign, on the one hand, the rank which medicine holds as a natural science, and on the other, the position of anatomy among the various sciences relating to medicine. The term science, according to the admii-able definition of the Roman orator, signifies certain knowledge, deduced from certain principles — cog-AUTHOR'S PREFACE. vii A 4 nilio certa ex principih certis exorta. Sciences are divided into^the meta- physical, the mathemalical, and the natural; but since the two former are not connected with our present subject, we shall du-ect attention to the natural sciences only. . . . . The object of the natural sciences, or of physics, taken in its widest signi- fication is a knowledge of the materials of which the universe is composed, and of the laws by which they are governed. They ai-e subdivided into the physical, and the physiological or zoological. The physical sciences take into consideration all the phenomena pre- sented by inorganic bodies; they comprise, I. Astronomy, which studies the heavenly bodies as they revolve in space, and estimates, by the aid of numbers, the laws by which their movements are governed ; 2. Physics, properly so called, or the study of the properties of matter in general; in aid of which, experunents are performed in order to exhibit phenomena in every possible light, and calculation is employed to render fruitfiil the re- sults of experiment ; 3. Geology, or that science which studies the surface of the globe, and the successive strata which are met with in its interior ; which goes back far beyond all historical traditions, brings to light, as it were, the very depths of the eaith, and traces with a sure hand the history of the globe, and the various revolutions it has undergone ; 4. Chemistry, which consists in the study of the reciprocal actions of bodies, when re- duced to then- atomic condition. The zoological or physiological sciences embrace all the phenomena pre- sented by living bodies. The science of botany examines into the structure and functions of plants ; but zoology, properly so called, investigates the organisation and the hfe of animals. The examination into structure or organisation constitutes anatomy. Physiology embraces the study of func- tions or of life. The facts presented to us in the zoological are of a totally different cha- racter from those comprised in the physical sciences. Inorganic bodies, in fact, are governed by constant and immutable laws, acting in perfect harmony with each other ; but living bodies are subject not only to phy- sical, but also to vital laws, the latter of which are constantly struggling against the former. This struggle constitutes life; death is the triumph of the physical over the vital laws. In consequence, however, of this con- tinual strife, derangements of structure and disordered functions very often occur ; and these become more frequent and more complicated, in pro- portion as the organisation is more highly developed, and the animal more elevated in the scale of creation. A knowledge of these derangements and of the proper means for re- storing both organisation and life to a healthy condition, constitutes the science of medicine; and the station which I have just assigned to tliis most important branch of zoological science will prove, better than any arguments, that the study of the physiological or healthy state of organi- sation and of life should precede that of their pathological or diseased conditions ; and that anatomy forms the first hnk in the chain of medical science. Each science has its own methods of investigation, and its peculiar ele- ments of certainty. Metaphysics and moral philosophy have a metaphysical and moral certainty. The mathematical sciences set out from a small number of self-evident propositions or axioms founded upon the nature of things, proceed gradually from the known to the unknown, and trust to problems already demonstrated as to so many axioms, by means of which, as steps, they again ascend towards new truths. The natural sciences',AUTHOR'S PREFACE. again, are founded upon observation, and observation is merely the evidence of our senses ; hence arises the necessity of exercising them, in order to increase their acuteness and their activity. Facts, therefore, constitute the elements of the natural sciences ; and then reasoning follows, founded upon those facts and upon analogy. It would be absurd to study the natural sciences after the same method as metaphysics. It may readily be understood, that as the purely physical sciences are based upon constant phenomena, mathematics are directly applicable to them, and hence they are termed physico-mathematical sciences; but in the zoological sciences, effects are continually varying, according to their causes. Any attempts, therefore, to apply the art of numbers to the elements of medicine, would be to imitate the philosopher, Condorcet, who entertained the whimsical notion of subjecting moral probabilities to the test of mathematical precision ; who was anxious to substitute a + 6 for either oral or written legal testimony ; who admitted half proofs and frac- tional proofs, and then reduced them to equations, by means of which he supposed he could arrive at arithmetical decisions, regarding the lives, the fortunes, and the characters of his fellow-men. It must, however, be reluctantly confessed, that we can acquire a know- ledge only of the surfaces of a body ; and that to say we are acquainted witta its texture, is to state in other words, that we have a knowledge of the smallest surfaces comprised within its general surface. Sight, touch, &c. the only means of investigation by which we can appreciate the qualities of matter in general, can recognise nothing but surfaces, appearances, and relative properties. Absolute properties they are unable to detect. With our organisation, we shall never know of what material objects essentially consist, but only what they are in relation to ourselves. This work being essentially of an-elementary nature, and in some measure adapted for the lecture-room, I have endeavoured to confine myself withui narrow limits, and strictly to avoid all considerations which are not mi- mediately connected with the anatomy of organs. At the same time I have not forgotten, that this work was mtended for the student ot medicine, and not for the naturalist; I have, therefore, been induced, in the following pa^es, if not expressly to indicate, at least to direct attention to the more immediate appUcations of anatomy to physiology, surgery and medicine. The objects which I have constantly had in view have been to exhibit the actual state of the science of anatomy ; to present its numerous facts in their most natural order ; to describe each fact clearly, precisely, and methodically ; to adopt such a method as would form an easy guide to the student and not involve him in confusion ; and lastly, to give to each detail its peculiar value, by invariably directing particular attention to the more important points, instead of confounding them with matters of less consequence, in an indigested and monotonous enumeration ot tacts. The following is the order in which the principal divisions of the subject ^''Thel^sJ'dLtion comprises Osteology, Arlhrology or Syndesmology, and ^ToSoay which, notwithstanding the great number of works onAUTHOR'S PREFACE. ix noints • the time of appearance of the primitive and complementary ossific So n • he periods a? which the several points unite, and the changes oc- cu rin. in the bone subsequently to its growth. By adoptmg this method, fhe most complicated ossifications are reduced to a few propositions easily ^Xln^otnrcra'rising from including in a description of the bones all the attachments of the muscles, and nearly the whole anatomy ot the part, is so totally at variance with a methodical arrangement of facts, that it is unnecessary-to oiFer an apology for the changes made m this respect Occasionally, however, I have mentioned those muscular attachments which might serve to characterise the osseous surfaces on which they are 2. Under the title Syndesmology, or Arthrology, are united all the articu- lations of the human body. Assuming as the only basis of classification the form of the articulated surfaces, which is always in accordance with the means of union, and the movements of the joint, I have been induced to modify the divisions usually adopted. The condylarthrosis, or condyloid articulation, and the articulation by mutual reception, form quite as natural o-enera as the enartlirosis and the arthrodia. It will, perhaps, be found, that the characters of the different kinds of articulation, and in particular those of the angular ginglyinus, which I have called the trochlear articulation, and those of the lateral gingb/mus, or the trochoid articulation of the ancients, are more clearly defined than in other anatomical works. The mechanism, i. e. the movements of a joint, is so intimately con- nected with its anatomy, that it was impossible to pass it over in silence ; on the othei- hand, it was sometunes difficult to determine the limit which ought to distinguish an anatomical from a physiological treatise. I have endeavoured to avoid both extremes, by confining myself strictly to the me- chanism of each joint in particular, referring to works on physiology for the principal movements of locomotion, and of animal statics, such as walking, running, standing, &c. 3. Odontology, or the description of the teeth, concludes the first division. I have taken care to point out that this juxtaposition of the bones and the teeth was founded upon their common indestructibility, and not upon the identity of their nature; the bones being organs composed of hving tissues, while the hard portion of the teeth, on the other hand, is but the solidified product of secretion. * The second division includes Myology, Aponeurology, and Splanchnology, 1. In treating of Myology, I have preferred the topographical to the phy- siological arrangement of the muscles, for this reason only, that it admits of all of them being studied upon the same subject. To unite, as far as was practicable, the undoubted advantages possessed by both methods, I have given, at the conclusion of myology, a general sketch of the muscles, arranged according to their physiological relations ; and by grouping them, not after their order of superimposition, but according to their several actions, I have arranged them around the articulations to which they may belong, and have pointed out the extensors, the flexors, &c. A muscle being known when its attachments are ascertained, I have thought it advisable to commence the description of each by a brief an- nouncement of its origin and insertion, as a sort of definition or summary. The particular details concerning its mode of insertion, whether it be apo- neurotic or fleshy, arid concerning the direction of its fibres, complete the ilescription of each muscle considered by itself; the. history of which is * See nolo, p. 231.AUTHOR S PREFACE. concludeil by an examination of its relations to neighbouring parts, and of its uses. The individual or combined action of the muscles, for the pro- duction of simple movements, follows so naturally after their description, and presupposes so correct and positive a knowledge of their anatomy, that it can be treated of with propriety only in a work on anatomy. The com- pound movements necessary for the consecutive or simultaneous action of a great number of muscles come within the province of physiology. 2. The aponeuroses, those important appendages of the muscular system, are separately noticed, in connection with the muscles to which they be- long ; but I have also described them together under the head of Aponeu- rology. This combination of analogous parts possesses the twofold advan- tage of simpUfying the science, by enabUng one part to elucidate the structure of another, and of permitting us to discover the general laws according to ■which these structm-es are disposed. 3. With some modification, I have adopted that old division of anatomy, which treats of the viscera and organs, and which is known by the name of Splanchnology. The brain and the organs of the senses, which were included in this division in all anatomical works preceding those of Soemmering and Bichat, have been removed from it, and described with the other portions of the nervous system. The description of the heart, in like manner, will be found with that of the other organs of cii-culation. In short, the old classification of the viscera, according to their locality, that is, into those of the head, the neck, the chest, &c. has been replaced by a more physio- logical arrangement. Splanchnology will therefore comprehend a de- scription of the organs of digestion and their appendages, of the organs of respiration (among which is included the larynx, or the organ of voice), and lasilu., the genito-urinary organs. . To the inquiry, why I have departed from the usual custom ot placing splanchnolosy at the end of anatomy, I reply that, in order to study, with advantage, the vessels and the nerves, it is necessary to have a pre- vious acquaintance with the organs to which they are distributed. The importance of the parts described in this division, and the practical results which flow from even the most superficial knowledge of then-forms, connections, and inthnate structure, are at once my reason and excuse tor extending, to so great a length, this portion of the work ; and, moreover, it is necessary to state, that there are many medical practitioners who learn anatomy only from elementary works. , . , • »u„ The third and the last division treats of the organs of arculation,\u. tue heart, arteries, veins, and lymphatics ; and of the sensory apparatus, viz. the organs of the senses, the brain, and the nerves. , , . • 1 No part of anatomy, perhaps, has been better known than the arteries, since the appearance of Haller's admirable works ; I could neither have followed a better guide nor a more perfect model. „ „f imnort 2 The studv of the veim has acquired an unexpected degree ot import- ance in consequence of the works of various physicians on phlebitis ; and oir'knowkd'? of them has been much ex/ended by the researches of XDupvl^tren into the veins of the spine, and the excellent plates of this '''t^::^SS^>piJt^^^^o. abandoned since thevery reiSable pKicltioifs 'of Mascagni: I have endeavoured to a^^^^^^^^^^ u.,t ^r^rlif WW to be -nven to the assertions ot some moc ein \\ iiteis, rotlnrng th: frequent communication between the veins and the lymph- atics.AUTHOR'S PREFACE. xi 4. The work of Soemmering on the organs of the senses, constitutes perhaps the highest title to fame possessed by that great anatomist; and it might even be said that he has left nothing for his successors to accom- plish, did not the constant study of a science of observation unceasingly proclaim this important truth, that it is in the power of no man to declare, beyond this lunit thou shalt not pass. The brain and the nerves, to which so many able and laborious inquirers have lately directed their attention, have been my favourite objects of in- vestigation ; on account of their importance, and perhaps, also, from the difficulties attending their study. Not satisfied with simply tracing the nerves to the vai'ious organs- in the body, I have studied them in the interior of those organs, and have endeavoured to ascertain the precise branches that are distributed to each particular part. I may add, that, in order to facilitate the dissection of the nervous sys- tem, and, indeed, of all the other parts of the body, I have presented, whenever it was necessary, a short account of the best method of prepa- ration. With regard to the general spirit of this work, I have been anxious to render it classical; and have avoided, most scrupulously, that species of induction and analogical reasoning, which, in a great measure, constitutes philosophical anatomy. To this kind of anatomy, I have never even intro- duced any allusions, except when its general ideas and views (almost always ingenious, but usually bold and speculative) might elucidate our own subjects. All the descriptions have been made from actual dissections. It was only after having completed from nature the account of each organ that I consulted writers, whose imposing authority could then no longer confine my thoughts, but always excited me to renewed investigations wherever any discrepancy existed. Anatomy being, as already stated, the basis of medical science, we should greatly misapprehend its nature, did we not consider it the chief of the accessory sciences of medicine. Without it, the physiologist rears his structure upon sand ; for physi- ology is nothing more than the interpretation of anatomy. It is anatomy that guides the eye and the hand of the surgeon; that inspires him with that ready confidence, which leads him to search amongst structures, whose lesion would be dangerous or mortal, for some vessel that must be tied, or for a tumour which must be extirpated. Nor is it less indispensable to the physician, to whom it reveals the seat of diseases, and the chans^es of form, size, relation, and texture, which the affected organs have under- gone. Anatomy is moreover the science which, of all others, excites the greatest curiosity. F the mineralogist and the botanist are so eager, the one to determine the nature of a stone, the other to ascertain the characters of a flower ; if the love of their particular science induces them to undertake the most dangerous voyages, in order to enrich it with a new species, what ought to be our ardour in pursuing the study of man, that masterpiece of creation, whose structure, possessed of both delicacy and strength exhibits so much harmony as a whole, and displays so much perfection in Its parts! . . r And whilst contemplating this marvellous organisation, in which all has been provided and pre-arranged with such intelligence and wisdom that no single fibre can acquire the slightest addition, or undereo the'least diminution of power, without the equilibrium being destroyed and dis-xii AUTHOR'S PREFACE. order being induced, — what anatomist is there, who would not feel tempted to exclaim with Galen, that a work on anatomy is the most beautiful hymn which man can chant in honour of his Creator. * May this work inspii-e among students an ever increasing ardour for the study of the organisation of man, which, even if it were not the most emi- nently useful, would still be the most interesting, and the most beautiful of all the sciences. And what more powerful motive for emulation can pre- sent itself to a generous mind, than the idea, " that every acquisition of knowledge is a conquest achieved for the relief of suffering humanity." Let it ne°ver be forgotten that without anatomy there is no physiology, no surgery no medicine ; that, in a word, all the medical sciences are grafted upon Anatomy as upon a stock ; and that the deeper its roots descend, the more vigorous will be its branches, and the more abundantly laden with flowers and with fruit. ■ ,i I must here express my acknowledgments to M. Chassaignac, the ana- tomical assistant to the Faculty, who has distmguished hmiself in several co7icours, and who has assisted me with the greatest zeal in the execution of this work. » " Sacrum sermonem quern ego Conditoris nostri veram hymnum compono, existimoque lib. ill.)CONTENTS OF THE FIRST VOLUME.

Object and division of anatomy.— General view of the human frame. — Apparatus of sensation—of locomotion—of nutrition—of reproduction.— General plan of the work. Considered in its most extended signification Anatomy * is the science which has for its object the structure of living beings. Living beings are divided into two great classes, vegetables and animals; there is therefore a vegetable anatomy and an animal anatomy. When anatomy embraces, in one general view, the whole series of animals, comparing the same organs as they exist in the different species, it receives the name of Zoological, or comparative anatomy. Zoological anatomy is denominated philosophical or transcendental, when from the combination and comparison of particular facts it deduces general results, and laws of organisation. AVhen anatomy is confined to the examination of one species only, it re- ceives the name of special—such as the anatomy of man, the anatomy of the horse, &c. Physiological anatomy considers the organs in their healthy state. Pathological anatomy regards them as altered by disease. yrh^nphysiological anatomy is confined to the examination of the external con- formation of organs, that is to say, of all their qualities which may be ascer- tained without division of their substance, it is called descriptive anatomy. If, on the contrary, it penetrates into the interior of organs, in order to determine' their constituent or elementary parts, it receives the name general anatomy, or of the anatomy of textures. Descriptive anatomy informs us of the names of organs {anatomical nomen- clature), then- number, situation, direction, size, colour, weight, consistence, tgure and relations: it traces in fact the topography of the human body. In more than one respect, it is to medicine what geography is to history. The anatomy used Toy painters and sculptors may be regarded as one of'its de- pendencies, and may be defined to be the knowledge of the external surface ot the body, in the different attitudes of repose, and in its various movements. Un this subject it may be observed, that the precise determination of the ex- ternal eminences and depressions may afford most important indications re- garding the situation and state of deeply-seated parts, and is therefore worthy the attention of the physician. •' Descriptive anatomy, in the sense here meant, has arrived at a high degree of perfection. It as to this branch that reference is made by those who affirm mat nothing now remains to be done in anatomy. But although descrintivP anatomy may be all that the surgeon requires to enable him to comprehend the lesions, which most commonly fall under his notice, and to perform operations U ^ill by no means suffice for the physician or the physiologist.

Nevertheless, however widely these membranes may be separated from each other, and however different they may be m external aspect, there are abundant analogies to estabUsh uneqmvocaUy their common ""under the skin there is a layer of adipose ceUular tissue, which gently elevates it, fills up the depressions, and contributes tofimpart that roundness of form which characterises all animals, and particularly the human species. In some parts, there are muscles inserted into the ski», which are intended for its movement; these are the cutaneous muscles. In man they are very in- considerable, and are confined to the neck and face, where they play an ini- portant part in giving expression to the physiognomy : but m the larger ani- mals they Une the whole skin, and in certain classes, of very simple organisa- tion, they constitute the entire locomotive apparatus. The superficial veins and lymphatics traverse the subcutaneous cellular tissue : the latter at various parts of their course pass through enlargements denominated lymphatic gangUons, or lymphatic glands, which are grouped to- gether in certain regions. . Below the cellular tissue are the muscles, red fleshy bundles arranged in many layers. In the centre of all these structures are placed the bones, inflexible columns which serve for a support to all that surrounds them. The vessels and the nerves are in the immediate neighbourhood of the bones, and consequently removed as much as possible from external injury. Lastly, around the muscles and under the subcutaneous adipose tissue are certain strong membranes, which bind the parts together, and which, by prolongations detached from their internal surface, separate and retain in their situation the different muscular layers, frequently each particular muscle: these envelopes are the aponeu- roses. Such is the general structure of the limbs or extremities. If next we examine the trunk, we find in its parietes a similar structure, but more internally are cavities lined by thin transparent membranes, named serous, on account of a liquid or serosity with which they are moistened. In these cavities are situated organs of a complex structure, called viscera, of which we shall give a rapid enumeration in an order conformable to the offices they perform in the animal economy. The human body, as well as that of other organised beings, is composed of certain parts, denominated organs (opyavov, an instrument), which differ from each other in their structure and use, but are all combined, for the double purpose of the preservation of the individual, and the continuance of the species. To accomplish these purposes, the organs are distributed in a certain number of groups or series, each of which has a definite end to fulfil. This end is de- nominated a, function: the series of organs receives the name of an apparatus. Of those necessary for the preservation of the individual, some are designed to place him in relation with external objects, and these constitute the apparatus of relation: the others are destined to repair the loss, which the parts of the body are constantly suffering; they form the apparatus of nutrition. The apparatus of relation may be subdivided into two classes: 1. The appa- ratus of sensation. 2. The apparatus of motion. Apparatus of sensation. The apparatus of sensation consists : 1. of the or- gans uf sense; 2. of the nerves; 3. of the brain and spinal cord. The organs of the senses are, I. Tlie skin, which possesses sensibility, the exercise of which constitutes tact. The skin being placed under the direction of the will, and rendered mobile in consequence of the peculiar mechanism of the human hand, is called the organ of touch. 2.

C. The venous system arises from all parts of the body: it takes up on the one hand all those matters which, having been employed a sufiicient time as part of the body, must be eliminated from it, and, on the other hand, all those substances which are carried into the system, to contribute to its reparation: it is composed of vessels denominated veins, -which at various distances are pro- vided with valves, and at last unite in forming two large veins called vena cava, of which one, the superior, receives the blood from the upper part of the body ; the other, the inferior, brings back that which has ckculated in the lower portion. These two vense cavte terminate in the central organ of the circulation — heart, a hollow muscle, containing four contractile cavities : two on the right side, the right auricle and ventricle; and two on the left, the left auricle and ventricle, D. Next to these in order of function is the respiratory apparatus composed of two spongy sacs placed on each side of the heart, and occupying almost the whole of the chest: these are the lungs. They receive the air from a common tube, the trachea, which is surmounted by a vibratile organ, the larynx, which opens externally by the nose and mouth, and constitutes the organ of voice. £. From that ca-vdty of the heart which is called the left ventricle, arises a large vessel, the aorta : this forms the principal and primitive trunk of the whole class of vessels, named arteries, whose office it is to convey red blood to aU parts of the body, to maintain their heat and life. F. There still remains one other portion of the nutritive system — the uri- nary apparatus, consisting of, 1. The kidneys, organs which secrete the urine: 2. The ureters, by means of which the urine, as soon as secreted, passes off into a spacious receptacle, the bladder, from whence it is at intervals expelled along a passage which has received the name of urethra. Apparatus- of reproduction. The apparatus above mentioned is destined for individual preservation: the organs which secure the continuance of the species constitute the generative or reproductive apparatus. They differ in the male and in the female. In the male they are, 1. The testicles, ■which prepare the spermatic or fecun- dating fluid; 2. The vasa deferentia, tubes -which transmit this fluid from the • testicle where it is secreted to the vesiculse seminales, 3. The vesicula seminales, or receptacles of semen; 4. The ejaculatory ducts, through which the seminal fluid passes into the urethra; 5. The prostate and Cowper's glands, glandular appendages of the organs for the transmission of the semen; 6. Tlie penis, by means of which the fecundating fluid is conveyed into the interior of the geni- tal organs of the female. The generative apparatus in the female is composed of the following organs : 1. The ovaries, the function of which is to produce, or keep in readiness, the ovulum or germ ; 2. The uterine tubes, which transmit the genn when fecun- dated to the uterus ; 3. The uterus or womb, in which the product of conception remains and is developed during the period of gestation; 4. The vagina, a canal -which permits the passage of the foetus at its final expulsion; 5. As ap- pertammg to the system should be mentioned the mammary glands, which se- crete the milk destined for the nourishment of the new-born infant. Generai, Plan of the Work. There are two methods by which the numerous facts that come within the range ot anatomy may be explained.

Thus the fossil bones, deposited m an invariable order of supposition in the crust of the earth, have been transformed into monuments more authentic than historical records. i, „f General vieiv of the skeleton. The bones form a system or whole, of which the different parts are contiguous, and united to each other. The only ex- ception to this ride is the os hyoides, and yet the hgaments by which it is con- nected with the rest of the system are evidently the representatives of the osseous pieces, which in the lower animals connect this bone with the tem- ^°The assemblage of the bones constitutes the skeleton. It is called a natural skeleton when its different parts are connected by their own ligaments; an ar- tificial skeleton, on the other hand, is one of which the bones are jomed together by artificial connexions, such as metallic wires, &c. The result of this union is a symmetrical and regular structure, essentially composed of a central coliunn, denominated the vertebral column or spine, which tenninates superiorly in a considerable enlargement — the cranium, and in- feriorly in certain immovably united vertebrse which constitute the sacrum and coccyx. To this column the following appendages are attached: 1. In front of and below the cranium a complicated osseous structure, the face, di\'ided into two maxillee, the superior and inferior. 2. On each side twelve bony arches, flexible, elastic, and curved — the ribs, which are united in front to another column, the sternum. These parts taken together form the thorax. 3. Four prolongations, called limbs or extremities, two superior, or thoracic as they are termed, because they correspond with the chest or _ thorax, and two in- ferior or pelvic, so named on account of their connexion with the basin or pelvis, but better named abdominal extremities. The thoracic and abdominal extremities are evidently modifications of the same fundamental type, and are essentially composed of the same number of analogous parts, viz. 1. An osseous girdle, the superior constituted by the bones of the shoulder, the in- ferior by the pelvis. 2. A part which may be in some measure regarded as the body of the limb, viz. the humerus, in the thoracic extremity, the femur in the abdominal. 3. A manubrium or handle, to use an expression of Galen, above the forearm, below the leg. 4. Lastly, digitated appendages which form the extremities, properly so called, viz. the hand and the foot. Number of the bones. Authors do not agree respecting the number of the bones. Some for inetance describe the sphenoid and the occipital as forming only one bone, while most anatomists consider them two distinct bones. Some admit three pieces in the sternum, which they describe separately. Many, after the example of the older writers, divide the haunch into three distinct bones— the pubes, the ischium, and the ileum: others recognise five pelvic, or sacral vertebras; three or five parts of the os hyoides: and lastly, the ossa sesamoidea and the ossa wormiana are omitted by some, but by others are reckoned in the enumeration of the bones. The ideas of certain modern authors with respect to the development of the bones, instead of dispelling the uncertainty which attaches to the enumeration8 OSTEOLOGY. of the parts of tLe skeleton, have tended not a little to increase the confusion, because many of them have made no distinction between bones, properly so called, and pieces of ossification. All doubt, however, in this respect will cease.'provided we consider as distinct bones only those portions of the ske- leton,' which are separable at the time of complete development. The time at which the osseous system arrives at its perfect development, is between the twenty-fifth and thirtieth year. According to these views, we may count in the human body 198 bones, viz.

The chief points embraced by detailed descriptions of a bone are, 1. Its name; 2. Its general BiTuation : /.Its direction ; 4. Its bulk and weight; 5. Its figm-e ; 6. Its regions; 7 iSTnternal conformation ; 8. Its intimate texture , 9. Its development. Nomenclature Osteological nomenclature has many imperfections.

Direction of bones. The dii-ection of a bone is absolute or relative fhe absolute direction is expressed by the terms straight, curved, angular ov twisted La word it is the direction of abone considered by itself, or independently of its situation in the skeleton. The long bones are never quite straight: sometmies they present a slight degree of curvature, as the femur; sometimes their extremities are curved in opposite directions, hke the letter S as the clavicle : sometimes again they are twisted upon their own axes, as the humerus, the fibula, &c. , , a,- 1, • The relative direction is determined by reference to the plajies which cir- cumscribe the skeleton. Viewed in this manner, a bone is vertical, horizontal, or oblique. It is needless to enter into any explanation of the terms vertical and horizontal; but with regard to the oblique direction, it may be stated that this is determined by the respective situations of its two extremities. For example, a bone is oblique, when one extremity approximates the superior, the median, and the posterior planes, while the other approaches nearer to the inferior, la- teral, and anterior planes: such a bone is said to be oblique, from above down- . wards, from within outwards, and from behind forwards. It is easy to see that in this way the situation of a bone relatively to the different planes, may be determined with the greatest exactness. It should be observed, that in de- scribing the direction of a bone, we should always set out from the same pomt. Thus if the direction of a bone from above downwards is spoken of, in deter- mining its obliquity from before backwards, and from within outwards, we should always commence with the superior extremity. Size, weight, and density of bones. The size of a bone may be measured by the extent of its three dimensions ; but as an exact estimate is not in general required, it is sufficient to indicate the volume of each bone relatively to others, whence has arisen the division of bones into great, middle-sized, and small; a distinction, however, altogether vague and futUe, since from the largest to the smallest bones there is so regular a gradation that the limits assigned must be quite arbitrary. The weight or the mass of the skeleton compared with the rest of the body, the weight of each bone, and the comparative weight of different bones, are points of little interest; such however is not the case with the specific weight or density of bones. In respect of density, viz. the number of molecules in a given volume, the bones are the heaviest of all organs. The truth of this assertion is by no means contradicted by the lightness of certain bones, which is only apparent, and which is caused by vacant spaces or cells in their substance. This den- sity varies in different Idnds of bones, in bones of the same kind, and even in different parts of the same bone. Thus, in the long bones, the greatest den- sity is in the middle : the extremities of the long bones and the short bones have a much lower density. The broad or flat bones hold a middle place between the shaft of long bones and the short bones. Of these broad bones those of the cranium are heavier than those of the pelvis. Age has a remark- able influence upon the specific weight of bones. It has been said that the bones of the aged are specifically more heavy than those of the adult, just as the bones of the adult are specifically heavier than those of the infant: and this assertion appears the more probable, from it being generally admitted, as a law of organisation, that the phosphate of lime increases in bones, with the pro- gress of age; and it is well-known that the weight of bones depends in part on tho10 OSTEOLOGY. presence of this calcareous phosphate. But on this point, as on many others, experience has refuted these preconceived opinions. Thus, it is certain that the specific, as well as the absolute weight of bones, is much less considerable la the old person than in the adult: and this difference depends upon the loss of substance -which the bones undergo, in common with aU other tissues, during the progress of age: thus, in aged subjects, the walls of the cy- linder of the long bones are remarkably diminished in thickness, while the medullary cavity is proportionaUy increased. We may even affirm with Chaussier, that the medullary cavity of the shaft of long bones has a greater diameter, in proportion as the individual is advanced in age. In like manner the ceUs of the spongy tissue become much larger, and their waUs ac- quire an extreme tenuity. It may nevertheless be contended, that the weight of the osseous fibre, or rather of the osseous molecules of the old people, is greater comparatively than that of the same parts in the adult: and this pre- sumption is abnost converted into certainty by chemical analysis, which shows an excess of phosphate of Ume in the bones of the aged: to remove all doubts upon this point, it would be necessary to grind an adult bone and an old one, and to weigh in the balance an equal bulk of each powder. In this way the contradictory statements of certain authors might be reconciled. The increasino- fragility of bones and the consequent frequency of fractures in old ao-e is easily explained, since along with the accumulation of phosphate of Ume which diminishes the elasticity while it increases the brittleness, there occurs a diminution of bulk, and consequently there is less resistance. It is with respect to the quantity of calcareous phosphate alone, that the osseous system can be said to preponderate in old age. . , , , • „:+i,„. Shape of bones. shape of a bone is determmed 1. by comparison either with different known objects, or with geometrical figm-es: the frontal bone has been compared to the scaUop-sheUs of pilgrims, the sphenoid to a Hi with extended wings, &c. It may be readily conceived *at notwithst^^^^^^^ its want of exactness, this method of comparison, so fanuhar to the ancients cannot be altogether proscribed.

H those of the thoracic. The longest bones are in the upper part of the limhs; it mav be said indeed that the length of bones is in the direct ratio of their ^rSLty to the trunk. The diameter of the long bones is smaUest in their Sr Vromlh s part, as from a centre, they graduaUy increase in volume, and at their extremities Lre much enlarged, so as to present a diameter double or treble that of the shaft. Every long bone, therefore, presents a bicomcal form. i. e. is shaped Uke two cones united by their summits. A long bone consists of a sAa/i and extremities. The ^P^g is ahnost" always prismatic and triangular; so much so, that m this respect the bones seem to be an exception to the general rule of organised bo^es which have usually a rounded form, and to approach nearer that of the mineral kinsdom, the characteristic shape of which is angular. The extremities of long bones are enlarged, that they may serve, l.for articulations; 2. for the insertion of ligaments and muscles ; 3. for th£ reflec- tion of tendons, the direction of which they alter. Eadi extremity presents a smooth articular surface, covered with cartilage in the fresh state, and not per- forated by any foramina, and a non-articular portion, rough, pierced with aper- tures, and covered with eminences and depressions. , Of broad or flat bones. These bones, intended to form the parietes of cavities, are more or less curved, and present, for consideration, a circumference and two surfaces ; the internal concave, the external convex. No single broad bone constitutes a cavity ; there are always a certain number united for this purpose. Some broad bones are alternately concave and convex on the same surface, as the haunch bones. In flat or broad bones there is no accurate correspondence between the inequalities, ridges, or depressions of the two surfaces. Thus the iliac portion of the haunch bones, instead of presenting a convexity on the inner surface, to correspond with the external iliac fossa, is hollowed out into another depression, the internal iliac fossa. In like manner, in the cranium certain impi-essions and eminences exist on the internal surface, while the external is uniformly convex and almost smooth. The parietal, and even the occipital protuberances, would be twice or three times more prominent if the interior concavity were faithfully represented by a corresponding external prominence, and if this concavity were not in a great measure hollowed out from the substance of the bon£. The circumference of broad bones being intended either for articulations, or for insertions, is for this purpose greatly thickened. Thus the parietal bones, which are very thin at their centre, become considerably thicker at the cir- cumference. The broad bones present at their circumference sometimes a simple enlargement, when it is intended for muscular insertions only; for ex- ample, the haunch bones : sometimes indentations of various kinds, and sinuosities, when it is to serve the purpose of articulation; for instance, the bones of the cranium. Of short bones. These are principally met with in the vertebral column, the carpus, and the tarsus; in fact, wherever great solidity is required in con- nexion with slight mobility: several of them are always grouped together; their form is extremely irregular, but generally cuboid; they have also numerous facettes for articulation. The non-articular portion is rough for the insertion of ligaments and tendons. Regions of bones. There are so many objects to be considered on the sur- face of a bone, that it is necessary, in order to prevent the omis^on of any essential detail in the description, to divide the surface into a certain number of parts or regions, which should be successively examined. These diflferent parts or regions have been denominated faces, borders, and angles. Thus in the prismatic and triangular shafts of long bones, there are three faces and three borders to be considered ; in the flat bones two faces and a circumference, which is again subdivided into borders and angles fonned by the meeting of these bor- ders. There are six faces in the short bones. These faces and borders are named sometimes from their situation superior, inferior, anterior, posterior, &c.i12 OSTEOLOGY. sometimes from the parts which they contribute to form, such as the orhiUtl and palatine faces of the superior maxillary bone; sometimes from their relations to other parts, as the cerebral and cutaneous face of the bones of the cranium, the frontal, occipital, and temporal borders of the parietal bones. When the borders give insertion to a great number of muscles, it has been deemed advisable to divide these into three parts or parallel lines : the middle is then called the interstice, and the two lateral are named lips, the internal and external lip; the superior border of the haunch bone, and the linea aspera of the femur are examples. Eminences and cavities of bones. The bones present certain emmences and cavities, of which it is proper to take a general survey m this place. Eminences of bones. The osseous eminences or processes were divided by the ancients into two great classes, apophyses and epiphyses, distinguished by the difference of their mode of development. According to their view, some of these eminences arise from the body of the bone, appearing to be nothing more than prolongations or vegetations of its substance: these they caUed apophyses; others, on the contrary, are formed by separate osseous centres or nuclei, which make their appearance at various times durmg the process of the development of bone : to these they gave the name of epiphyses. Ihis dis- tinction, however, founded upon incomplete observation has been totally re- jected, since the researches of M. Serres on Osteogeny have rendered it evi- dent, that almost aU the osseous eminences are developed from isolated nodides; so that an eminence, which at one time is an epiphysis, becomes . afterwards an apophysis. If therefore the majority of eminences are formed from separate osseous points, the difference ^^^^.^^f J^em can apply only to the relative periods at which they become united to the body of the bone. A far more important distinction is that by which the eminences are di- vided into articular and non-articular. The articular eminences have received different ..^-J.^^Peth o a denticulations, when they form angular eminences '"^^^^^^^g ^J^J^^^^etce saw ; these are best seen in the bones of the cramum.

Inences has been denominated the crista galli, because i No part of the language of osteology perhaps is more faulty than the no- menclature of the eminences. Thus, how unlike is the spme of the scapula to the spinous processes of the vertebra?, or the styloid process of the temporal to the diminutive projection called styloid of the radius ! Many emmences •which perform analogous offices have received different names : thus the emi- nences of the humerus, which give attachment to its rotating muscles, are called the great and small tuberosities ; while the corresponding parts of the femur have been denominated trochanters. Whilst therefore we retain the names consecrated by usage, we shall be careful to point out the more rational terms substituted by modern anatomists, and particularly by Chaussier. The size of the eminences of insertion is in general proportional to the number and strength of the muscles and ligaments which are attached to them. To be convinced of this fact, it is only necessary to compare the male and female skeleton, or that of a man of sedentary habits and that of a person devoted to athletic exercises. This remarkable correspondence between the size of osseous eminences and the strength of the muscles which are inserted into them, has given rise to the opinion that these eminences are foi-med by muscular traction. It is easy to refute this notion, and without entering into details which belong to general anatomy, we shall prove, by facts, that the osseous projections enter into the primordial plan of organisation, so much so, that they would have doubtless existed, even though the muscles had never exer- cised any traction upon the bones. I have twice had occasion to dissect the thoracic extremities of individuals, who in consequence of convulsions during their earliest infancy had suffered complete paralysis of these parts. The limb affected had scarcely the proportions of that of a child of eight or nine years, whilst the opposite limb was perfectly developed. Nevertheless in this atrophied limb the smallest, as well as the largest projections were perfectly marked. Moreover, very powerful muscles are often inserted into cavities, as, for instance, the pterygoid cavity of the sphenoid. Cavities of bones. Besides the great cavities of the skeleton, cavities in the formation of which many bones concur, and which are destined to lodge and defend the organs most important to life, there are a great number of smaller excavations formed in the substance of the bone itself. These cavities, like the eminences, are divided into two great classes, arti- ticular and non-articular. The articular cavities have received different names. 1. The term cotyloid designates the articular cavity in the haunch bone, be- * [ Also from xcfmri, a CTovrfi^ like a crowfi Ct^oS [Jiljd.14 OSTEOLOGY. cause it is deep and round, like a vessel known by the ancients under the name of KoriAij. 2. The name glenoid (from 7A.iifr;) is applied to many articular cavities, which are more shallow; for example, the glenoid cavity of the sca- pula, the glenoid cavity of the temporal "bone. 3. The term alveoli has been assigned to the cells or sockets in which the roots of the teeth are lodged. It is not correct, however, to consider as an articulation the union of the teeth with the jaws, because, as we shall afterwards show, the teeth are not true boaes. The non-articular cavities are to be considered with reference both to their figure, and their uses. From their figure they have received the following deno- minations: 1. FosscE, or pits, are cavities largely excavated, wider at the margin than at the bottom; ex. the parietal fossoe. 2. Sinuses are cavities with a narrow entrance; as the sphenoidal sinus, maxillary sinus, &c. 3. The term cells is applied when the cavities are smaUbut numerous, and communicating with each other as the ethmoidal cells, &c. 4. Channels (gutters) are cavities which resemble an open semi-cylindrical canal; as the channels for the longitudinal and lateral sinuses of the skull. 5. These take the name of grooves Ccoulisses) when they are Uned by a thin layer of cartilage, for the passage ot tendons ; as the bicipital groove of the humerus. The term pulley or trochlea is applied to grooves, which have their two borders also covered with cartUage. 6. bur- rows are superficial impressions, long but very narrow, and intended for the lodgment of vessels or nerves, as the furrows for the middle menmgeal artery. 7 When more deeply excavated than the last, and angular at the bottoni, they are named by the French anatomists Rainures. 8. A notch (incisura) is a cavity cut in the edge of a bone.* ' ^ . The cavities which we have described exist only on one surface of a bone; those which perforate its substance are usuaUy denominated foramina or holes. 1 AVhen a foramen has an irregular, and, as it were, lacerated oriface, it is named ?i foramen laceram. 2. When its orifice is very small and irregular it is called hiatus ; when the opening is long, narrow, and resembhng a crack or slit it s denominated a fissure ;\s the sphenoidal fissure the glenoid fissure &c 3 If the perforation runs some way through the substance of a bone it ;<! railed a conduit or canal, as the Vidian canal, carotid canal, &c.

For the nutrition of bones, such being the use of the three orders of nutritious canals already described. We must mention along with these osseous cavities other markings or impressions seen on the siuiace of many bones • for example, the shaUow depressions in the lower jaw bone for the sub- lingual and sub-maxillary glands, the impressions named digital on the internal surface of the cranium. , , i. • i * „r As the eminences of bones have been attributed to the mechanical eflect of muscular traction, so the various unpressions and vascular furrows upon the internal surface of the cranium have been considered to be the result of pressure and pulsation. But it would be more correct to limit ourselves to the simple statement, that the impressions and eminences on the inside of the cranial bones exactly correspond with the elevations and depressions on the surface of the brain, and also that the osseous furrows for the middle meningeal artery cor- rectly represent the ramifications of that vessel. We may here pomt out certain rules to be followed in describing the ex- ternal conformation of bones. 1. In describing the surface of a bone it should be so divided, that the description may comprehend but few objects at a time. Thus a broad bone is to be divided into two surfaces, into angles and borders, which are to be successively studied. 2. The bone being thus subdivided into regions, each of these is then examined, care being taken regularly to proceed from one part to its opposite, i. e. to pass from the superior to the inferior sur- face, and from the anterior to the posterior. This is the only method which in a long description will guard against omissions and avoid tiresome repetitions. 3. It is also of great importance, in considering the objects presented by each region or surface, to foUow an invariable and regularly progressive order. Thus, after exposing the objects placed in front, the examination should be con- tinued uninterruptedly from this point backwards. 4. In the symmetrical bones, it is advisable to describe, first, the objects situated in the median line, and aftei-wards those placed laterally. Internal conformation of bones. The tissue of bones, like that of most other organs, presents the appearance of fibres, whose properties are throughout identical, but which by certain differences in their mode of arrangement, give rise to two forms or modifications of structure. To one of these the name of compact substance has been given ; to the other that of spongy or cancellated sub- stance. A subordinate modification of the latter has long been described under the name of reticular tissue. The spongy or cellular substance has the appearance of cells and areola;, of * [Whatever pthcr purpose they may serve, such cells .ind sinuses are, in most inst.inces, to be regarded as a provision I'or increasing the Irulk and strength of bones witliout u corresponding augmentation of weight.]16- OSTEOLOGY. an irregular shape and variable size, all of which communicate -with each other, and their walls are partly fibrous, partly lamellar. The compact substance seems to consist of fibres strongly compressed, so as to form a close firm tissue. It is both fibrous and areolar. By means of careful inspection, softening the bone in nitric acid and studying its development, it has been clearly proved that it IS fibrous and that in long bones the fibres are arranged longitudinally, while in broad bones they seem to diverge like rays from the centre to every part of the circumference ; and that in the short bones they are disposed irregularly, so as to form a superficial layer, or crust. The researches of Malpighi have conclusively shown that it is also areolar, or sportgy. By examining a bone softened by nitric acid or studying it in the foetal state, it may be seen that in fact the compact tissue is nothing more than an areolar substance, the meshes of which are extremely close, and much elongated. Accidental ossifications, and the diseases of bone which so frequently exhibit the compact tissue converted into spongy, and the spongy changed into compact, complete the demonstration.* In strictness, therefore, but one form of osseous tissue can be admitted, namely, the areolar, which presents itself under two aspects, sometimes being close, compact, and fasciculated, sometimes spongy and ceOular. Having thus become acquainted with these two forms of osseous tissue, their general ar- rangement in the different kinds of bones is next to be examined. Internal structure of long bones. A vertical section of a long bone presents in the body or shaft a cylindrical cavity, which, in the fresh state, is filled with a soft fatty substance, named the marrow. This cavity, or medullar)/ canal, is of greatest diameter at the middle of the shaft; and as it recedes from this point it is narrowed and intersected at various parts by lamellse detached from the sides, and forming a sort of incomplete partitions. Sometimes, however, there is a complete partition: thus I have seen the cylinder of a femur divided into two distinct halves by a horizontal partition situated precisely in the middle of the bone. The medullary canal is not regularly cyhndrical, nor does it correspond in figure with the external surface of the bone It com- municates with the exterior by means of the nutritious canals, which some- times run for a considerable distance in the substance of the bone, parallel to the medullary cavity, with which they communicate by numerous apertures, and transmit the vessels as far as the extremities of the bone. Some have sup- posed that the cavity existed only in order to receive marrow, while on the other hand it has been maintained, that the marrow existed only to M up the cavitv Whatever be the uses of the marrow, it is certain that the exist- ence of a cavity in the centre of long bones is an advantageous Provision for strength; for it is proved in physics, that of two cyhnders composed of the same ma erial in equal quantity, tie one which is hollow, a^^whose ^^^^ are consequently greater, will offer greater resistance than that which is sohd By the contrivancl therefore, of the medullary canal there is an ^crease of strength without augmentation of weight.

The medullary membrane ivhich lines the walls of the canal; 2. The fatty tissue, properly so called, or the medullary liquid. The membrane, highly vascular, serves to nourish the mterual layers of the bone: it possesses great sensibility and a high degree of vitality. The fatty tissue, on the contrary, is altogether insensible. If a probe be introduced into the centre of the medulla of a long bone in a Uving animal, no sign of pam is evinced so long as the instrument does not touch the walls of the cavity; but whenever the waUs are rubbed or scratched, the pain becomes excessive, and is manifested by piercing cries and violent struggles. The proportion between the thickness of the walls of the cylinder, and the diameter of the medullary canal, varies not only in different individuals, but in the same person at different periods of life. In the aged, the thickness of the walls is proportionally much less than in the adult: this is one cause of the great fragility of the bones in old age. Sometimes in the adult the walls are so thin, that the bone breaks by the slightest force: in such cases there is in some sort hypertrophy of the medulla and atrophy of the bone. It is in such cases that fractures occur from the simple effect of muscular contraction, or even from moving in bed. It is in the central canal of long bones that those very delicate osseous filaments are observed, which, interlacing with each other, and forming large meshes, give rise to that variety of spongy tissue which has received the name of reticular, and which appears intended to give support to the medulla. The compact tissue diminishes, and the cells increase in number, the greater the distance from the centre of the bone, so that the extremities are entirely com - posed of spongy substance covered by a thin layer of compact tissue. It ap- pears that the compact tissue which forms the shafts of the bones, divides and subdivides into lameUaj, in order to form the cells of the extremities. It is easy to perceive the advantage of a spongy structure in the usually voluminous extremities of the long bones : they could not have been compact without a great increase of weight, while the additional strength thus acquired would have been redundant and altogether useless. The cells of the spongy substance are filled by an adipose tissue, similar to that which exists in the bodies of long bones: from its greater fluidity it has been denominated medullary juice. Internal structure of broad bones. If the surface of a broad bone be scraped, or if the bone be sawn across perpendicularly or obliquely, it will be found to consist of two lamellce or tables, separated by a greater or less thickness of spongy tissue. Hence the two plates are insulated, and one may be fissured or broken without injury to the other. The thickness of the compact laminse and of the spongy tissue is not uniform throughout the whole extent of a broad bone. At the centre, for example, there is scarcely any spongy tissue, and hence the transparency of the bone at this part. Towards the circumference, on the contrary, the spongy tissue forms a very thick layer. In the bones which form the vault of the cranium, the spongy substance takes the name of diploe (SnrXSos, double), because it occupies the interval between the two tables. _ From what has been said regarding the internal structure of broad bones. It is evident that their distinctive character depends as much upon their internal as their external conformation, and therefore the ribs, which according tO' their external characters seem rather to belong to the long bones, have been classed among the broad, because they exhibit in their internal structure the characters of the latter kind of bones. Internal structure of short bones. The extremity of a long bone, if separated from the shaft, would represent a short bone, both in its external and internal conformation for a short bone is a spongy mass, covered by a thin layer of compact tissue. , To their spongy structure the short bones, as well as the ex- tremities of the long, owe their specific lightness. It should be observed, that what has been said concerning the internal struc- VOL, I. Q18 OSTEOLOGY. ture of bones applies ia strictness only to those of the adult, because the younger the subject, the less are the cells of the spongy tissue developed. And m hke manner as the walls of the cylinder of long bones diminish in thickness, and the medullary cavity increases in diameter in the aged, so by the progress of age the walls of the cells become extremely thin, and the eel s theinselves very large. In some cases of disease, for example after white swelhng of the ankle- joint, I have observed true medullary canals in the cuboid bone and calcaneum; and I have remarked in one case of cancer of the breast, that the ribs adjoining Ae tum Jur were hollowed out by a sort of medullary canal. It is to this dimi- nution of the osseous substance, this kind of atrophy ot the bone, that I am Sosed to attribute the fragiUty so often observed m the whole osseous system " h7:i7co%7:uLof bones. The bony tissue consists essentially of two dis- tinct eTements, one inorganic, the other orga^dsed.

' The medullary artery gives off the twigs for those layers of compact tissue which form the parietes of the medullary cavity. The arteries of the second order, destined for the spongy tissue, enter the bones by the nutritious foramina of the second order; but their mmiber by no means corresponds with that of the foramina, which are for the most part destined for the transmission of veins. These arteries communicate both with the medullary artery already mentioned and with the arteries of the periosteum. The arteries of the third order, or the periosteal arteries, are exceedingly nu- merous. This class comprehends the innumerable little arteries which, after ra- mifying in the periosteum, enter the bone by the minute canals of the third order. These small vessels specially distributed to the exterior layers of compact sub- stance, anastomose with the two preceding orders of vessels. 2. The veins of bones follow the course of the arteries. But there are pe- culiar venous canals in the interior of the broad and the short bones, and in the spongy extremities of the long bones. These canals were first described by M. Dupuytren in the cranial bones, where they are very obvious: they are perforated with lateral openings, by which they receive blood from the ad- joining parts; their parietes are formed by a very thin plate of compact tissue, and they are lined by a prolongation of the internal membrane of the veins. "We shall afterwards see that there is a complete analogy between these venous canals and the sinuses of the dura mater, the only difference being in the nature of their parietes, which are fibrous in the sinuses, but bony in the canals in question. I have remarked, that in the foetus and new-born infants the cells of the spongy tissue which subsequently contain adipose matter, are filled with venous blood. Lymphatic vessels have not yet been actually demonstrated in the bony tissue : but it is probable that they really exist there; at least the process of nu- trition in bones and certain morbid phenomena which they present lead to the belief of their existence. The cellular tissue also enters into the composition of the bones; it contributes to form their fibrous structure. Nerves are met with in bones. I have seen a nervous twig entering the nutritious foramen of the tibia. Development of Bones, or Osteogeny. From the time of their first appearance in the foetus, to the period of their complete development, the bones pass through a series of changes, which con- stitute one of the most important circumstances in their history. The inves- tigation of these changes, or of the successive periods of development, is the object of osteogeny. The development of the bones, considered generally, presents three phases or periods, designated by the name mucous, cartilaginous, and osseous stage. 1. The mucous stage. The mucous condition, the cellular of some authors, has not been well defined. Some apply the term to that period of formation m which the bones and the other organs of the body form but one homogeneous mass of a mucous aspect: others use the term to signify a more advanced stage, m which the bones acquiring a greater consistence than the suiTounding parts begm to show their development through these more transparent tissues. In the latter sense the mucous stage is obviously nothing but the commence- ment of the cartilaginous, and therefore the first acceptation is the only one to be retamed. •f^' V^^ cartilaginous stage succeeds the mucous, though the time of the trans- ition from the one to the other has not been precisely ascertained. Several anatomists are of opinion with Mr. Howship, that the cartilaginous state does not necessarily intervene between the mucous and osseous conditions; that its occurrence is only satisfactorily demonstrated in such bones as are late in20 OSTEOLOGY. ossifvinc, and that it constitutes a sort of provisional condition, in which the cartila-e is employed to perform the office of hone.

The ossification spreads by Uttle and Uttle, always preceded by a great development of vessels; so that, in attentively examining an ossitymg cartilage, we find first an osseous point, then a red zone, next an opaque layer of cartilage which is permeated by canals, and lastly the remaining cartilage traversed only by a few vascular canals which run towards the point of ossi- fication. Moreover, it is always at some depth within the substance of the cartilage, that the first osseous points appear, and never at the surface. It is only in cases of accidental or diseased ossification, as in the cartilages of the ribs, that it occasionaUy begins at the surface. It is unnecessary to pursue further the immediate process of ossification: nor need we here discuss the purely speculative question, whether the bone is really a new part essentially distinct from the cartilage, which is absorbed and gives place to it, or merely a deposit of earthy phosphate in a cartilaginous tissue. In admitting that ossification is always preceded and accompanied by a great development of vessels, a fact proved incontestably by Haller andBichat, I must nevertheless decidedly dissent from the opinion, that the appearance of blood in a cartilage is a constant indication of approaching ossification; for several cartilages have naturally bloodvessels, as may be seen in the cartilages of the ribs and larynx. The study of the development of the bones does not consist merely in de- termining the number and time of appearance of their points of ossification: it comprehends also the ulterior changes which take place in the osseous system, viz. the union of the primitive points of ossification, and the appearance and junction of the complementary points of ossification. It is to be remarked, that the order of development and union of the points of ossification does not always correspond with that in which they originally appear ; nay, it is often the reverse. Thus the lower epiphysis of the femur is the earliest in appearing, and it is the last in joining ; whilst, on the other hand, the upper end of the radius is one of the latest of the epiphyses in appearing, but is joined to the boneOSTEOLOGY. before all or nearly all the rest. The junction of the pieces of ossification is not complete till about the age of twenty-five years, at -which time the lower epiphysis of the femur unites with the body of the bone. General mode of Ossification of Eminences and Cavities. M. Serres in a very remarkable work has given, under the title of General Laws of Osteogeny, the results of his observations concerning the development of azygos or median bones, and of eminences and cavities; and with a rapid notice of these, we shall conclude what is to be said on the points of ossification. 1. By the law of symmetry, which according to M. Serres governs the deve- lopment of all bones situated on the median line, every such bone is originally double, that is, composed of two separate halves, which advancing to meet each other are at last joined. Thus there are originally two osseous halves of the spinal column, and two demi-sterna. The basilar portion of the occipital, the body of the sphenoid, the cribrifrom plate of the ethmoid, the vomer, and the spinous processes of the vertebrae, have according to this view originally been double. But this law has many exceptions. Thus, although some of the pieces of the sternum are commonly formed from two lateral points, the first and the last are always or almost always developed from a single point in their middle. The bodies of the vertebrae are most commonly formed from a single primitive nucleus : the same is the case with the basilar portion of the occipital, the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, the vomer, and the spinous processes of the vertebrae. Instances of incomplete division of bones on the median line must not be adduced in proof of the existence of two primitive points of ossification. 2. Every eminence, according to M. Serres, is developed by a special point of ossification. This is true generally : but how many eminences are formed merely by the extension of ossification from the piece which supports them! Where, it may be ask^d, is the special point of ossification for the articular processes of the vertebrae, the coronoid process of the ulna, the external and internal protuberances of the occipital, &c. ? There are even double eminences developed from a single point, as the condyles of the femur. 3. Every cavity is formed by the union of at least two pieces of ossification; so that, when a bone furnished with a cavity consists of several pieces, the place of junction of these pieces is at the cavity. Thus the three pieces of the OS innominatum meet together at the cotyloid cavity. The same law, accordmg to M. Serres, regulates the formation of the foramina and osseous canals of every kind, as the medullary cavity of the long bones, all the canals for vessels and nerves, as the carotid, vidian, &c.: according to the same law, all the fora- mina in the bone of the skull are foi-med originally of two halves. But the facts are opposed to this doctrine when applied so universally. Progress of Ossification in the three Kinds of Bones. 1. In the long bones. Ossification commences in their middle part. A small cylinder of bone ap- pears, narrow in the middle, expanded at the ends, tubular withm, perforated already with the nutritious foramen which is vei-y obvious, and receives very large vessels. This Uttle cylinder grows graduaUy thicker and longer, ex- tending towards the extremities of the bone which it reaches about the time of birth : whilst at this period the ossification is so far advanced in the body of the long bones, their extremities are not yet osseous. It is only at later periods varying in different bones, that an osseous nucleus appears in the cartilaginous extremities, increasing and encroaching upon the portion of car- tilage which separates it from the bony shaft until that cartilaginons pa.tition craduallv becoming thinner, is at last itself mvaded by the ossification. All fhe lon/bones have two essential or principal epiphyses to which comple- mentary%p°physes are sometimes added. The phalanges * are an excepu^^^^^ they have only one. It is this process which is named junction ?f the epiphyses The time of its completion is not confined to any very defimte hmits, but it is over by twenty or twenty-five years. • [Also the clavicle, the metatarsal, and usually the metacarpal bones.]DEVELOPMENT OF BONES. 23 • c 4 Throusrhoutthe whole time of development, the growth in length takes place inrougnouiine wuuic :„tp™ecliate cart lage, which separates the epi- chiefly by ossification ^J'';^2f^^long^nLll expansion of the ossified ^u^fXT rlf^mTSeltZ^^^^ has been satisfactorUy established shaft Itself.

''TlTZ ltdLes. 1. Am'ong the broad bones tto^e whic^i ar^^ symme^ trical often commence by two points placed one on each side of the median hie " The Symmetrical bones are developed sometimes from a single point of^ossification, as the parietal; sometimes by several as the emporal. One of he most remarkable circumstances in the development of broad bones is the sort of radiation by which the deposition of calcareous phosphate Stends, which spreads from the centre where the first osseous point was de- posited' and advances by divergent rays to aU points of the circuniference^ forming bony stride separated by intervals which are soon filled up by new osseous rays. As these rays are of unequal length, and are separated at the circumference by intervals of greater or less extent, it foUows that a broad bone in the process of ossification must have at its cuxumference a scaUoped or jagged border, like the toothed edge of a comb. It is this form of ossili- cation which gives rise to the serratnres of the sutures. The broad bones are proportionally much thinner m the early periods of os- sification than subsequently, because at first the spongy texture is scarcely de- veloped. At the time of birth the primary pieces of ossification not having united except in very few places, and the ossification which spreads from the centre of the bones not having yet reached the limits of their circum- ference, it follows, that the constituent parts of bones, and the edges of dif- ferent bones which are destined in the end to meet together, are at this period separated by cartilaginous, and in some measure membranous intervals, which in the cranium constitute the fontanelles. After birth, ossification spreads more and more m the broad bones ; at the same time they increase in hardness and thickness, appearing as if to separate into two plates or tables, the in- terval between which becomes filled with spongy tissue. The epiphysary or complementary points of ossification of some of the broad bones represent, in a certain degree, the epiphyses of the long bones. They occupy the circumference, and are thence named marginal epiphyses. Thus in the cartilaginous border of the haunch-bone, which represents the crest of the ilium, a point of ossification commences, and extending along its whole length forms a marginal epiphysis, which subsequently joins the rest of the bone, and in this respect is perfectly analogous to the epiphyses at the extremities of the long bones. The epiphyses then are not an exclusive attri- bute of the long bones, as Bichat maintained. They are found also in some of the short bones. But it would be indulging in a false analogy to class the Wormian bones, formed during the development of the cranium, with the epi- physes of the long and the broad bones ; for they have peculiarities which are never found in true epiphyses. Thus, 1. They are not joined by osseous union, as is the case with epiphyses, but always by suture. 2. There is no constancy in their time of appearance, nor in their figure which is irregular, nor in their size which is in general greater the earlier they have appeared, because they have then had longer time to extend themselves before meeting the neigh- bouring bones. From what has been said, we conclude that the broad bones have a two- fold mode of increase in breadth, namely, the successive addition of bony sub- stance to their borders, and the formation of marginal epiphyses. In every broad bone which is formed from several pieces, and which has on its surface a part for articulation, this last becomes Jhe centre in which the different pieces meet, and are ultimately joined when the ossification is completed24 OSTEOLOGY. 3. In the short boms. These are the latest in being ossified; a great number of them are stiU cartUaginous at birth. The short bones are not destitute of epi- physes, as is pioved by the ossification of the vertebra; and calcaneum. Their ossification in fine presents the same phases, and foUows the same_progress as that of the extremities of the long bones, which they resemble m so many respects. Changes which take place in Bones after Maturity. To obtain a complete notion of the development of the bones, we must not rest satisfied with ascertaining the number of points of ossification, their successive appearance, and their mode of junction; we must also study the changes which they undergo after they hdve attained their full growth The increase of the bones in height tei-minates when their several pieces have become united: the time when this is accompUshed varies fi;om the age of twenty to thirty years ; but they continue to mcrease m thickness for a considerable time longer. In proof of this we need only compare t^e bone of a young man with those of an adult of forty. In old age the bones still un- dergo important changes : the medullary canal of the long bones augments in width, and the thickness of its parietes diminishes m proportion ; and somethmg similar takes place in the broad and the short bones. Another important fact to be here mentioned is, that the relative proport on of calcareous phosphate and animal matter undergoes contmual changes in the bourse of life. Thus by an analysis of Dr. I. Davy it was shown, that the propor- tion of cacareous phosphate was a fifth less in a child of fifteen years than in raduU ThesaL an adroccipital was to that in an occipital bone of an aged person as sixty-four to sixty-nine. Nutrition of Bones. The fact of the nutrition of bones and the process of composition and decomposition in which it consists, appear to me to be demonstrated by the ex- periment with madder.

General characters of the ^'^rtehra.-Characters v<^culiar to^^^^^ • each region. - Characters proper to certain vertebra;. -Vertebra; of the sacro coccygeal region.- The vertebral column in general. —Development. The vertebral column (from the Latin word vertere, to turn, because the body turns round this as an axis), spine, or rachis, is that long, flexible, hollow, bony stem, the principal lever of the body, which affords support to al- most the entire skeleton, and at the same tmie shields and protects the spinal marrow. It is situated at the posterior and median portion of the trunk, extendmg from the cranium to the pelvis, where it termmates in two os- seous pieces, the sacrum and coccyx, which may in fact be regarded as a continuation of the column. The sacrum and the coccyx have been separated from_ the vertebral column merely on account of the osseous junc- tion of the vertebrae of which they are composed.* It is articulated with the base of the cranium at the part where the posterior joins the two anterior thirds of this cavity : it corresponds with the posterior portion of the pelvis, an arrangement most favourable for maintaining the erect position. The vertebral column is situated behind the aliment- ary canal in man, above it in the lower animals. In front are suspended the organs of respiration and circulation, to which it affords protection, and which constantly tend to incline it forwards: to its sides are attached the ribs and the extremities, the thoracic having an indirect and movable, the abdominal a fixed, connexion. From the limits here assigned to the vertebral column it follows that this part of the skeleton extends the whole length of the trunk, forming the entire osseous support of the neck and loins, the posterior column of the thorax, and even the posterior wall of the pelvis. Hence it is divided into four regions, viz. a cervical, a dorsal or thora- cic, an abdominal, and a pelvic or sacro-coccygeal region. The vertebral column {fig. 1.) is composed of twenty- six bones piled above each other : the last two have re- ceived the names of sacrum and coccyx, and the others which constitute the vertebral cohimn, properly so called (a fZ) are denominated vertebrae: they have also been called true vertebra, as distinguished from the false ver- tebrae, which by their osseous imion form the sacnim (d e) and coccyx (e /). The sacrum is composed of five of these false vertebrte, and the coccyx of four, in a rudiment- ary state. The description of these latter bones will be deferred in the mean time. The first seven true verte- brte form the cervical region (a b) ; the twelve which succeed constitute the dorsal (b c) ; and the last five the lumbar region (c d). There are occasionally, but very rarely, some varia- tions in the number of vertebras. In a few cases only six cervical vertebrae have been found, and Morgagni • The same is true of anchylosis, as of certain differences of form and development, viz. that llicy lead to the CBtabliuhment of varieties, but cannot form the ground of total separation.2G OSTEOLOGY. who first observed this anomaly, considers it to be a predisposing cause of apoplexy, on account of the accompanying shortness of the neck, and con- sequent approximation of the heart and brain. There are sometimes thirteen dorsal vertebraj: sometimes the fifth lumbar is united to the first sacral, and there are then only four lumbar vertebrse. In other cases, the first sacral ver- tebra is distinct from the rest, and the lumbar portion of the column then consists of six. • , , The vertebra; present general characters, which distmguish them from all other bones: they have also characters peculiar to each particular region ; and in each group or region certain vertebrae have individual distinctive cha- racters. Fig. 3. General Characters of the Vertebrae. Every vertebra (Jigs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.) is essentiaUy a symmetrical ring, a Fig 2. segment of the cylinder which protects the spinal 7 '■ ^Si^Y' marrow, and is consequently peiforated by a fora- J*^'^%:^s^sM ''(^yS^ denominated the vertebral or nichidian fura- ^ -(<nStaS^^»<TKa men i\,fig- 2.). As it concurs also to form part of a supporting column, it presents a kind of enlarge- ment or solid cylinder, of which the posterior fifth has been removed. This enlargement is the boihj of the vertebra (2). Each vertebra gives attach- ment to numerous muscles, by very marked emi- nences for insertion-the spinous (3) and transverse processes (ij). Itis articu- lated with the other vertebra by four articular processes (5 5), two superwr and two inferior. Lastly, it presents two superwr and two i»/er,or notches (7, figs. 4,1), which unite to form the intervertebral foramina, through which the vessels and nerves are transmitted. , ,„v • *t. xne ves>hei!. a ^ ^^^^ ^j^^ vertebra (2) occupies the anterior portion of the vertebral ring, and presents four surfaces.

D The articular processes (5 5) arise from the lateral portions of the arch near its junction with the body of the vertehra: their direction is m general vertical, i. e. perpendicular to the direction of the articulating surfaces of the body, which are horizontal. They are four in number, two superior or ascendmg, and two ivferior or descending; they are placed symmetricaUy on each side of the median line, and are covered with cartilage m the fresh state, to torm a movable joint with the articular processes of the adjacent vertebra ; they project beyond the level of the bodies of the vertebra;, so that their articula- tions correspond with the intei-vertebral substances. Hence the vertebral column presents two successive series of articulations, one constituted in iront by the union of the bodies, the other behind by the articular processes. E. The transverse processes (4 4) are lateral prolongations, which arise Irom each side of the vertebral ring, pass horizontally outwards, and vary in length and size in the different regions. _ i -u i,- j F. In front of the articular and transverse processes, immediately bebind. and at the side of the body of the vertebra, are four notches cut m the lateral parts of the ring {7, figs. 4 and 5.) : the inferior are generally deeper than the superior, but their depth varies considerably in the different regions. The part of the vertebral ring between the upper and lower notches is reduced to a sort oipedicle; it is the weakest part of the vertebra, and consequently it is the prLucipal seat of torsion in curvatures of the spine. The constituent parts of a vertebra are therefore, 1. In the median line, the body, the foramen, the spinous process, and the lamina; 2. On each side, the articular and transverse processes, the notch, and the pedicle. The Fig. i Characters peculiar to the Vertebrce of each Region. characters distinctive of the vertebrae of each region of the spine are most marked in those placed in the middle of the respective region, for at its extremes the vertebra3 acquire intermediate or mixed cha- racters belonging to the two regions near the confines of which they are situate. It may be remarked that the vertebra; of each region may be at once recognised by one single distinctive character: thus the cervical vertebra; are always known by a foramen in the base of the transverse processes (a, fig. 2.) ; the dorsal vertebrjB by facettes hollowed out on the sides of the bodies (6 6, fig. 4.) ; and the lumbar (Jig. 5.) by the absence of the two preceding marks. The cha- just mentioned might then sufiice as mere distinctive marks, but they would not answer the pui'poses of exact anatomical description. Indeed, a vertebra is cervical, dorsal, or lumbar, rather in virtue of its entire form and structure than by reason of any single circumstance per- taining to it. We shall examine in regular order each part of a vertebra, as it exists in the different regions. Bodies of the Vertebrce in different Regions, ■ The first distinctive character is their size. This progressively increases from the cervical to the lumbar region (a, b, c, d,fig. 1 ) : taking the size of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae as unity, that of the dorsal would be two thirds, and that of the cervical one half. racters28 OSTEOLOGY. The second distinctive character is the proportion of the diameters. In all vertebraj the transverse diameter is the greatest, and the vertical the smallest. In the lumbar vertebrae the height or vertical diameter is twelve Unes (one inch), in the dorsal nine lines (three quarters of an inch), and in the cervical six lines (half an inch). In the cervical and lumbar regions, the vertical diameter of the body is less behind than before, which inequality gives rise to the anterior con- vexity of these regions. In the dorsal region, on the other hand, the vertical dia- meter is shortest anteriorly. In the lumbar region, the transverse diameter does not exceed the vertical and the antero-posterior by more than one third at most. In the dorsal region no one diameter is strikingly predominant; but in the cervical the transverse is almost double that of the antero-posterior and the vcrtiCcil di£iiiiGt6rs. The third distinctive character is formed by the lateral ridges of the bodies of the cervical vertebra. From the two sides of the superior surface of the bodies of the cervical vertebraj, arise two small ridges (Jig. 2. on each side of 2), which are received into corresponding depressions on the inferior surface of the vertebra above. This mutual fitting-in of the bodies of the cervical vertebrae compensates for the less secure connexion of their articular processes. The fourth distinctive character consists in the two demi-facettes on each side of the bodies of the dorsal vertebra (6 &,f g. 4.). These demi-facettes when united with the corresponding parts of the neighbouring vertebrae form an- gular excavations, in which the posterior extremities of the ribs are received. This character belongs exclusively to the dorsal vertebrae. The fifth distinctive character is the excavation of the superior and inferior surfaces of the bodies, which is less in the dorsal region than in the cervical or lumbar. From this disposition it results, that a lenticular space of a much greater size intervenes between every two of the lumbar and cervical Ver- tebra; than between the dorsal: the mobility is consequently much mcreased, from the greater size of the intervertebral substance. . , .-^^ The specific characters, then, of the bodies of the vertebra; in the different regions are the foUowing: —1. Lateral ridges on the superior surface of the cer- vical vertebra. 2. Lateral faccttes on the dorsal vertebra. 3 The absence oj these two characters, and the preponderance of size in the lumbar vertebra It the body of a vertebra be presented for our inspection, we can at once deter- mine from these characters the region to which it belongs. The Vertebral Foramen and the Notches in the different Regions of the Spine. The vertebral foramen and the notches present certain marked distinctions in the vertebrae of the three regions, by which they may be recognised by a practUed eye transverse diameter of the foramen (l,y?sr. 2.) condderably exceeds the antero-posterior. 2. In the dorsal region he two conbiueid,ui^ , ^„„„i there is this much remarkable, that a very SSbirdetrs o^'^S^^^^^^ -face of the body of the consideiaDie oep transverse diameter is the greater, but ?h7difference fmu^less rfmarkable than in the cervical.

I, „.y be „„„ked here, ^-^^jf^^rS^^^VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 29 lateral motions are more extended than in the loins, the transverse diameter s stiU greater in the proportion of eleven to ten. It must be observed, however lhat thf diamelers o/the foramen bear reference not only to the mobihty of the part, but also to the size of the spinal marrow. The notches present also certain diiferences m the different regions ; thus in the dorsal and lumbar regions (7, figs. 4 and 5.), the inferior are much deeper than the superior; in the cervical region they are ot almost equal depth Tfiih. It may Lo be remarked, that the depth of the notches and conse- quently the size of the intervertebral foramina are generaUy proportional not only to the size of the spinal ganglions, but also to the capacity of the_venous canals, which estabUsh a communication between the external and internal veins of the spine. It is then possible, when only the vertebral foramen and the notches are seen, to determine the region to which the bone belongs. The Spinous Processes and Lamince in the different Regions. 1. In the cervical region, the spinous processes are prismatic and triangular (3, figs. 2, 3.), grooved inferiorly for the reception of the spinous process ot the vertebra below during the movements of extension, and bifurcated at their summit for the purpose of muscular insertion. Their direction is horizontal and consequently favourable to extension. 2. In the dorsal region (3, fig. 4.) they are prismatic and triangular, with a tubercle at their summit: their direction is extremely oblique, approaching to the vertical. This direction, together with their great length, causes them to descend considerably below the inferior surface of the body of the vertebra. Hence a sort of imbrication, and to such a degree, that a very slight move- ment of extension causes them to touch each other. 3. In the lumbar region, the spinous processes (3,5.) are broad, thick, and quadrilateral, presenting on their sides a large surface for muscular insertion : their posterior border is thick, tuberculated, and triangular. Their direction being horizontal, presents no obstacle to extension. The two laminBB {h b, fig. 2.), which form the posterior arch of the ver- tebra, are continuous with the base of the spinous process. Their length is directly proportionate to the dimensions of the part of the canal to which they correspond, and their thickness is in proportion to the size of the spinous process. 1. In ike cervical region, the laminae are thin, very long, and so inclined, that when the head is erect, i. e. in a position intermediate between flexion and extension, the inferior edge of the superior laminae passes beyond the supe- rior border of the vertebra below, so that there is a true imbrication of these laminae, not less marked than that which we have observed of the spinous processes in the dorsal region. There has been consequently no case recorded of the entrance of any penetrating instrument into the spinal canal, in the situ- ation of the undermost five cervical vertebrae, which fact is the more easily conceivable when we reflect, that the least impression upon the back of the neck excites instinctively an extension of the head, and thus increases the imbri- cation of the laminae. 2. In the dorsal region the thickness of the laminae is greater than in the neck, but still inferior to that in the loins : they are com- paratively much shorter than in the cervical region, and instead of forming an elongated rectangle, they represent a square, nay, their vertical dimension almost exceeds the transverse. 3. In the lumbar region they are characterised by great thickness, by diminution of the transverse, and marked increase of the vertical diameter. In general it may be stated, that the height of the lamina corresponds with the thickness of the body of the vertebra to which it belongs: hence they are so narrow in the cervical region. To sum up then the characters of the spinous processes and the lamintc: _ 1.

Dorsal region: — Spinous processes, prismatic and irianyular, long, oblique, and tubercu- lated at their summit, with short vertical lamina:. 3. Lumbar regiou: — Spinous processes quadrilateral, strong, and horizontal, with very short, thick, and vertical lamina:. It is possible tben from the spinous process and its laminae alone to determine tbe region of any vertebra. T/ie Articular Processes in the different Regions. In tbe cervical region (5 5,Jigs. 2 and 3.) the articular processes form small columns, and are so directed that their articular surface makes with the hori- zon an angle of about 45°: the superior look upwards and backwards, the inferior downwards and forwards. It is important to remark this direction, because it permits the movements of flexion, extension, and lateral inclina- tion : it is owing to the same circumstance also, that luxations of the cervical vertebrsB may occur without fracture of their articular processes. It shoydd be also observed, that the articular surfaces of the right and left sides are in the same plane. 2. In the dorsal region (5 5, Jig. 4.) the articular processes are simple la- mina, the direction of which is vertical and the surface plane. The superior look backwards and outwards, the inferior forwards and inwards. The articular facette of the right side is not on the same plane as that of the left. T should observe, that in certain cases the dorsal articular processes are found as it were locked together, the extremity of the superior process being received into a deep notch on the surface of the inferior process of the vertebra above. . , 3 In the lumbar region (5 5, fig. 5.) the articular processes are very strong, with curved surfaces. The superior concave look backwards and inwards ; the inferior convex, forwards and outwards. They both represent two seg- ments of a cylinder, one of which completely surrounds the other, or rather the inferior resemble half hinges, which are received into the half rings formed by the superior processes. It should be observed here, that the supe- rior articular processes are prolonged by certain tubercles, to which the name of apoplu/sary may be correctly applied, and whkh serve for the msertion of muscles. To sum up then what has been said : The cervical articular processes are small columns, cut with plane faces a t an inclination of 45°, those of both sides on the same plane ; the dorsal are thin lamina:, plane and vertical, but not in the ..ame plane; the lumbar strong, vertical, and tnberculated lamincB, with a curved articular surface. The region of any given vertebra may be easily recognised from its articular processes alone. The Transverse Processes in the different Regions of the Spine.

In the lumbal' region, the transverse processes (4, fig. 5.) are thm narrow lamina;, flattened from before backwards. They are situated in a plane anterior to that which the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae occupy, and almost correspond with that of the ribs, with which also they have numerous other analogies: hence the name costiforin processes given them by some anatomists.* The characteristics then of the three kinds of transverse process are, in the cer- vical region, a grooved projection with a foramen at the base ; in the dorsal region, a strong process inclined backwards, tubercidated, and articular at the extremiti/; in the lumbar region, a small, thin, blunted projection. It is therefore extremely easy to determine the situation of a vertebra by the transverse process. The truth of what we formerly remarked will be now evident, viz. that a vertebra is distinguished as cervical, dorsal, or lumbar, by the form of all its constituent parts. Uniform in their fundamental type, these bones present in each region, and in each part, certain differences adapted to their respective uses. Characters proper to certain Vertebrce. We have now noticed, 1. the general characteristics of the vertebrae, by means of which they may be recognised from aU other bones; 2. the peculiar distin- guishing characters of the vertebrae in each region. We have now to examine in each region those vertebrae which are distinct from all the others of that part of the spine. The place of each vertebra might, strictly speaking, be de- termined by comparing it with all the other vertebrae of the same region : in this way those who are accustomed to articulate skeletons acquire surprising readi- ness. But a few vertebrae only possess sufficiently characteristic peculiarities to determine their situations without comparison with the others. It is only in the vertebrae at the extremity of each region, and which on account of their position have a mixed character, that such distinctive and individual attributes can be observed. The first, second, and seventh cervical vertebrae, the first, eleventh, and twelfth dorsal, and the fifth lumbar, require special description. First Cervical Vertebra, or Atlas {fig- 6.). In the first vertebra, or atlas, the place of the body is supplied by an arch (a g), flattened from before backwards, the anterior arch of the first vertebra. Its convexity turned forwai-ds is marked by a tubercle (a), the an- terior tubercle of the atlas. Its concavity, c looking backwards, presents an oval facette, slightly hollowed for articulation with the odontoid process of the second vertebra. The superior and inferior borders afford attach- 2 ment to ligaments. The foramen of the first vertebra is much larger than that of all the others. The antero-posterior diameter, which in the neck and back is six lines, and in the loins eight, is here fourteen; the transverse diameter eleven lines in the neck, seven in the back, and ten in the loins, is here thirteen. This remarkable extent of all the diameters is not simply owing to the size of the spinal marrow * The description wliicli we have given of the transverse processes is in accordance with that usually found in works on human anatomy. Several modern anatomists, however, do not admit of the arrangement which we liave adopted. Frora tlie existence of cervical and lumbar ribs in the skeletons of many vertebrated animals, they maintain that in man, the anterior half of the cervical transverse processes, and the thin plates of the lumbar transverse processes, re- present the ribs of the dorsal region ; while the parts truly analogous to the dorsiU transvofse processes arc, 1. in the cervical region the posterior half of the transverse process; 2. in the lumbar region those projections which we have called apopliysary tubercles.82 OSTEOLOGY. at this point, for the anterior portion of the foramen (f,g,f) gives lodgment to the odontoid process of the second vertebra, so tliat the antero-posterior diameter of the part which contains tlie spinal cord does not greatly exceed that of the foramen in the succeeding vertebra;. The transverse diameter alone is more considerable, whence the possibility of lateral displacements or incomplete luxations of the first upon the second vertebra without any marked compression of the cord. The notches (A/i) are situated on the posterior arch at its junction with the lateral masses. They are posterior to the articular processes, whilst in aU the other vertebra; they are anterior. The superior are very deep, often con- verted into a foramen by a bridge of bone, and seem to be continuous with the foramen in the base of the transverse process, by means of a horizontal groove which winds round behind the articular process. This groove is sometimes almost converted ijito a complete canal. From the union of these parts, viz. the notch, groove, and foramen, a twisted canal results, vertical at first and afterwards horizontal, along which the vertebral artery runs in its passage into the craniimi. Through the superior notch, which almost^ forms by itself the first intervertebral foramen, the vertebral artery and vein and the first cervical nerve pass. The inferior notches present nothing remarkable, excepting that they are sufficiently deep to form by themselves the interver- tebral foramen between the first and second vertebrae. There is no spinous process: its place is supplied by a posterior tubercle (i) for muscular insertion, analogous to the anterior tubercle, or more correctly resembling a spinous process truncated. Sometimes, instead of a, tubercle, there are only some inequalities. The posterior arch (Ji, i, h), which formF, more than half the circumference of the vertebra, consists of two strong and long plates. The articular processes or columns, which we have remarked throughout tUe whole cervical region, are very large in the atlas, and bear the name of lateral masses. This structure is connected with the use of the bone, which is to support the occipital condyles, and consequently the weight of the head. Of the four articular processes the superior (6 b) are concave, slanting m- wards, oval, and obliquely directed from behind foi-wards, and from without inwards. Their form exactly corresponds with the convexity of the occipital condyles (7 7, Jig. 10.), which they receive, and for this purpose their external borders and posterior extremities are considerably elevated. Withm and below the articular surface are certain inequalities (fffig. 6.), which give attachment to the transverse ligament. The inferior articular processes are circular and plane ; they look downwards and a little inwards. The transverse processes (cc) are very large and triangular : they have on y one tubercle, into which are inserted the principal rotatory muscles of the head : they are perforated by a foramen (e) at the base, but are not grooved on their ^"^ThTcharacteristics then of the atlas are, an annular forni—great lateral dimen- sions so that it surmounts the vertebral column like a capital—a very large vertebral foramen-no body,nor spinous process-large lateral masses, supporting very strong transverse processes, which are not grooved, and have only one tubercle.

The body (c) of the axis presents anteriorly a tri- angular vertical ridge, which separates two lateral depressions for the attachment of muscles The pos- terior surface corresponds with the vertebral canal. The greatest diameter of the inferior surface is the an- tero-posterior: it is obliquely sloped downwards and - w forwards, and sUghtly concave, for the reception ot the body of the third cervical vertebra. This mutual reception of the two bones does nottakeplacebetweenanyofthe succeedmgvertebrse. _ . Uc an The foramen is shaped like the figure of a heart on playing cards : it an- tero-posterior diameter is. eight lines, which is two hnes "^^^^ ^mn m the o^^^^^ cervical vertebra, and its transverse diameter is the same. This great size ot the for^en of the second vertebra corresponds with the extent of the movements between it and the atlas. , „ , n • „ u„ Ucoif There is no superior notch, the inferior notch of the atlas forming by itseit the intervertebral foramen. The inferior notch presents nothing peculiar. The spinous process m), though of great length, is even more remarkable for its breadth and thickness, presenting as it were, in an exaggerated degree, tne characters of the cervical spinous processes: its form is prismatic and triangular; it is grooved inferiorly, and terminates by two tubercles for the attachment ot powerful muscles. The spinous process is for the axis that which the trans- verse process is for the atlas, both giving insertion to powerful muscles which move the head upon the vertebral column. The lamince, which correspond as usual with the size of the spmous process, are remarkably strong. , a a The superior articular processes ((i) are placed, on each side ot the body. Their facettes are broad, flat, and almost horizontal, being slightly inclined out- wards. This direction permits the atlanto-axoidean articulation to be the centre of all the rotatory movements of the head. The inferior articular processes (e) resemble those of the other cervical vertebras. The transverse processes (n) are small, with only one tubercle, triangular, bent downwards, and perforated at the base by a foramen (/) or rather a bent canal, which is hollowed out on each side of the body of the bone; and is vertical in the first part of its course, then horizontal. This canal, and that which we have described upon the atlas, mark the winding course of the vertebral arterj- before it enters the cranium. The specific characteristics then of the second vertebra, are the odontoid pro- cess, the great size of the spinous process and the lamince, the large size and hori- zontal direction of the superior articular processes, which are placed on each side of the body, and the shortness of the transverse processes, which are triangular and have one tubercle. Seventh Cervical Vertebra, or Vertebra Prominens (b, fig- !.)• The body has the ordinary character^ observed in the cervical vertebra;, but in size it resembles that of the dorsal vertebra;, and frequently presents laterally a small impression for articulation with the head of the first rib. The spinous ■process bears the greatest resemblance to those of the dorsal vertebra;: it is pyramidal, terminates in a single tubercle, and is of great length, projecting considerably beyond the level of the other cervical vertebra;; hence its name of vertebra prominens. The articular processes are almost vertical, and are not supported by small columns. The transverse process, although grooved and perforated at the base as in all the other cervical vertebra;, closely ap- proaches to the characters of the dorsal. The posterior border of the groove, vol,. I. D34 OSTEOLOGY. or posterior root of the process is thick, tubercular, and exactly similar to a dorsal transverse process, while the anterior is thin and rudimentary, excepting in cases where it is separated from the body of the bone, and forms a super- numerary rib.* The foramen in the base of the transverse process is very rarely absent, but is most commonly small: in one case only I have found it double. It is never traversed by the vertebral artery. First Dorsal Vertebra. This vertebra resembles the cervical, in having its body surmounted laterally by two hook like processes or ridges, but in all other respects it is strictly analogous to the other dorsal vertebrae. It should be also observed, that the body presents an entire facette for the first rib, and a third or fourth part of another for the second. Eleventh and Twelfth Dorsal Vertebrce. The eleventh dorsal vertebra presents on each side of the body an entire facette for the eleventh rib. Its body is very large, and the place of the trans- verse process is supplied by a tubercle. The twelfth dorsal vertebra {c,fig. 1.) resembles the lumbar in its body, which is scarcely smaller than that of the lumbar vertebrtB, and of which the trans- verse diameter begins to predominate. The spinous process is horizontal, strong, and quadrilateral. The transverse processes are represented by trfbercles, which, like those of the preceding bone, are evidently continued in the lumbar region by those tubercles which we have denominated apophysary. Lastly, the body presents entire articular facettes. It is distinguished from the eleventh dorsal vertebra by the curved surface of the inferior articular processes. Fifth Lumbar Vertebra. The inferior surface of the body slopes very obliquely downwards and for- wards The transverse processes vary in size, but are generally much larger than those of the other lumbar vertebrae; the inferior articular processes, which are further separated from each other, have a flat surface, and look di- rectly forwards. , . ^ ,- These are the only vertebrae which in each region present peculiarities. Excepting the first and second cervical, which have many characters quite foreign to the vertebrae of the region to which they belong, it might be said of those peculiar vertebra; which have been specially described, that their peculi- arities are comprehended in the general statement that those vertebrae which are placed at the limits of any two regions possess characters belonging to both regions. Vertebra of the Sacro-coccygeal Region. All the vertebrse of this region, nine in number, are in the adult state united into two bones : the five superior form the sacrum, the four inferior the cocci,x. The Sacrum (d, e,fig. I and 8.). The sacrum has received its name from the alleged practice of the w= of offerin- this part of the victim in sacrifice. It occupies the nostertr and SSi part'of the pelvis, behind the point where this cavity posterior ana me v arrangement advantageous for the ^recf ptition It I inSd, like a wedge, between the two haunch bones, erect posiuou. ii. vertebral column, below with the coccyx. lepreseS by thrsacrU forms an obtuse angle with the Imnbar column, .

This angle is denominated the prcmwntory, or the sacro-vertebral angle {d. fig. 1.): it is an important object of study, both with reference to the mechanism of standing, and m the practice of mid- wifei-v.* The sacrum is curved upon itself, from behmd forwards, so as to present an anterior concavity. It is the largest of all the bones of the vertebral column ; hence the name oi great vertebra appbed to it by ffippocrates. It is proportionally more developed in man than in any other mammiferous animal, which is connected with the erect bipedal attitude and the sitting attitude which belong to him in a special manner.f The form of the sacrum is that of a quadran- gular pyramid Avith a trunpated apex, the base looking upwards. It is symmetrical like all the median bones, and presents for consideration an anterior, a posterior, and two lateral surfaces, a base, and & summit. The anterior, pelvic, or rectal surface (fig. 8.) forms part of the cavity of the pelvis. Its concavity varies much in different individuals, and in the two sexes : but on this latter point there is great diversity of opinion among anatomists. Some believe that it is greater in the female, whence it is said results the advantage of a larger capacity of the pelvis, and consequently an increased facility for the passage of the head of the foetus durmg parturition. Others, on the contrary, contend that the male sacrum is more curved, and that of the female almost straight; and they argue that, had the opposite been the case, the coccyx which forms a continuation of the curve of the sacrum would have been directed forwards, and thus diminished the antero-posterior diameter of the outlet of the pelvis ; whereas, with a slight curve of the sacrum, the coccyx has no tendency to project, but is easily bent backwards during labour. | In order to determine the validity of these opposing statements, I have compared a great number of sacra from both sexes, but I could never detect any difference sufficiently marked or constant to be considered as charac- teristic of the sex. The anterior concavity of the sacrum is interrupted by four transverse pro- jections (1111, fig. 8.), which correspond with the points of union of the sacral vertebrae, and are analogous to the intervertebral prominences. The first is sometimes so prominent, that it might be mistaken for the sacro-vertebral angle in an examination per vaginam. On each side of the median line, are the anterior sacral foramina (2 2 2), four in number, the two superior much greater than the two inferior. They give passage to the anterior branches of the sacral nerves, to the sacral veins, and some smaU arteries. External to these are grooves for the nerves, and the attachment of the pyramidalis muscle. The anterior surface of the sacrum is contiguous to the rectum which follows its curvature. Posterior, spinal, or cutaneous surface. Its convexity is exactly proportioned to the anterior concavity. 1. In the median line it presents the sacral ridge, formed by a continuation of the spinous processes of the vertebral column. This is often entire in its whole length, but sometimes interrupted: it bifurcates * The sacro-vertebral angle is most remarkable in man, because he alone is destined for the erect posture. By this angle the impetus of movement transmitted from the vertebral column to the sacrum is In part destroyed. In midwifery it explains the rarity of median positions of the vertex. t Birds which, like man, are biped, are also remarkable for the size of their sacrum. X A very great curvature of the sacrum diminishes not only the antero-posterior diameter of the inferior, but also that of the superior aperture of the pelvis ; and it thus opposes tlie ascent of the uterus from the true into the false pelvis. Accoucheurs cannot too carefully study the varieties presented by the curvature of this bone. The sacrum is often affected by a species of rickets, when the other bones of the pelvis are free from deformity ; .and this fact may be easily explained by a reference to the uses of this bone in supporting the whole weight of the trunk.36 OSTEOLOGY. inferiorly, and forms the borders of the groove which terminates the sacra, canal. The sacral ridge is rarely found cleft throughout its whole length. 2. On each side of the median line are two shallow grooves, named the sacral grooves: they are continuations of the vertebral grooves;they are pierced by four posterior sacral foramina, smaller than the anterior foramma, and differing less from each other in diameter. These afford passage to the posterior branches of the sacral nerves, to some veins and arteries. They are bordered by two ranges of unequal projections : the first row placed mterior to the foramina, represent the articular processes united together; the second, ex- ternal to the foramina, are more marked, and correspond with the transverse processes also united. . , , •, ^ The lateral surfaces ( d, e,fig.\.) are triangular, broad above, narrow below, where they constitute mere borders. They slope obliquely from before backwards and from without inwards, so that the sacrum is wedged between the haunch bones in an antero-posterior as well as in a vertical direction In front is a demi-oval or crescentic suiface (7, fig. 8.) com- pared from its shape to the human ear, and hence denommated auncviar sur- face In the fresh state it is covered with cartUage, and articulates with tne OS inuominatum.

It is not uncommon to find the last pieces of the coccyx deviating from the median line. Of the Veetebeal Column in general. Having already described the situation of the vertebral column, we shall now consider its dimensions as an entire piece of the skeleton. Dimensions of the Vertebral Column. 1. The length or height of the vertebral column does not correspond with the length of the spinal marrow, which does not extend below the first lumbar ver- tebra. It varies at different ages, most commonly it increases up to the twenty- fifth year, but occasionally its growth is completed before this period. In the adult it remains unaltered, but in old age it becomes shortened by the in- curvation of the trunk forwards, and the yielding of the bodies of the vertebrae and the intervertebral substances. This latter cause is also productive of a very appreciable shortening of the trunk, sometimes to the extent of half an inch after long walking or standing. When measured along its curvatures, the length of the column is generally two feet four inches ; in vertical height it is two feet two incbes. These dimen- sions are not exactly proportional to the height of the individual, which depends principally upon the length of the lower extremities. In this respect I have never found any marked difference between tall and short persons. In an adult of medium stature, the cervical portion measures five inches and a half, the dorsal nine inches and a half, the lumbar six inches and a half, and the sacro-coccygeal six inches and a half. It may be easily conceived, that in cases of abnormal curvature the vertical height must present considerable differences, while the actual length of the column may remain almost constant. In the skeleton of a female affected with rickets, a vertical line, stretched from the tubercle of the atlas to the base of the sacrum, measured one foot, six inches, and six lines, while a line which fol- lowed the inflexions of the column measured two feet eighteen lines, giving a difference of seven inches. Hence the possibility of a rapid and considerable increase in length in those patients who are submitted to continued exten- sion. 2. Antero-posterior dimensions. The antero-posterior diameter, at the sacro- vertebral angle and in the lumbar region, is three inches ; in the dorsal region, two inches four lines ; in the middle of the cervical region, one inch six lines. 3. Transverse dimensions. The transverse diameter is eighteen lines in the lumbar region, thirt£en in the middle of the dorsal, and twenty-two in the cervical. It should however be remarked, that the transverse processes are included in this measurement of the cervical region, but not in the othersOSTEOLOGY. 38 Direction. The general direction of the spinal column is vertical, hut it presents certain alternate curvatures. There are four antero-posterior curvatures, viz. in front a convexity in the neck (a, b, fig. 1.), a concavity in the dorsal region (i, c), a convexity in the loins (c, d), and a concavity in the sacro-coccygeal region ((/, e, f). Behind, the opposite curvatures are observed. The degree of each curvature is always proportioned to that of the others: thus, if there be a re- mai-kable projection in the cervical region, there is a corresponding degree of concavity in the dorsal, and a proportional convexity in the lumbar regions. So great indeed is the mutual dependence of these curvatures, that the slightest modification of one produces corresponding alterations in all the others. There are many individual varieties of these curvatures : their efiect appears to be that of augmenting the power of resistance in the vertical direction, or at least of diminishing the effect of vertical pressure. It may be physically demonstrated, that of two similar rods made of the same materials that which presents alternate curves will support a greater amount of pressure in the ver- tical direction than that which is straight, on account of the decomposition of forces which occurs at each curvature. In addition to these antero-posterior curvatures, there is at the level of the third, fourth, and fifth dorsal vertebrae a lateral inclination, the concavity of which is on the left side. This being the exact situation in which the aorta, the principal artery of the body, makes a curve downwards, some anatomists have ascribed the concavity of which we .epeak to the cui-vature of this vessel. Bichat imagined it to be owing to the almost universal habit of employing the right hand, in which action the upper part of the trunk is inclined to the left, so as to afford a point of support, and as it were a counterbalance to the action of the right arm, which inclination by frequent repetition becomes permanent. According to this hypothesis, left-handed individuals should present a curvature in the opposite direction, and Beclard has shown that such is in reality the case. I may add that I have always found the deviation greatest in those who used their right arm in the most laborious employments. Of late years it has been supposed that the lateral curvature depended upon the position of the foetus in utero: had this been the case, it should exist at birth which, as I can affirm, it never does. Notwithstanding the Ukelihood of Bichat's opinion, yet if we consider that in every case in which an artery is immediately contiguous to a bone, that bone presents a corresponding depression, it may be questioned whether the opinion of the older anatomists has not more foundation than is eenerally admitted. However slight this lateral incurvation may be, it always produces a correspondent one in the lumbar region, though in the majority ot cases this is scarcely perceptible. „tr,^i«n-;^oi The history of abnonnal curvatures or deviations belongs to patnologicai anatomy. I shall only observe that they are all due to the foUowmg causes : 1 ThTwastiog of the vertebrse by caries or softening. 2. Want of eqnihbnam between the strength of the vertebral column and the weight of the body either alone or when loaded with burdens. 3. Muscular traction. 4. The frequent repetition of any attitude in which the column is curved. Figure and Aspects.

From this position of parts arises the possibihty ol eflfectuaUy compressing the arteries against the vertebral column, a method which has been successfully adopted with the carotid arteries and abdominal aorta It also explains the marked pulsations in the abdominal region frequently observed in emaciated subjects, and often giving rise to an erroneous suspicion of aneurism. 4.

This presents, 1. in the median line the row of spinous pro- cesses, the whole of which constitute a vertical crest or ridge denominated spine, and hence the names spinal column and rachis Qaxh, spine). This ridge commences with the tubercle of the fii'St vertebra, is suddenly enlarged at the second, diminishes again at the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebree, and projects anew at the sixth, and more remarkably at the seventh; thence named vertebra prominens. Below this point the processes become oblique, prismatic, triangular, and with one tubercle : their obliquity increases, but they become more slender from the first to the tenth: in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth dorsal, they become horizontal, shorter, and stronger; and they are broad, square, rectangular, and horizontal in the lumbar region. Lastly, the ridge gra- dually sinks down in the sacro-coccygeal region, when it ends by dividing into two smaller ridges, leaving between them a furrow, which is continued aloBg the coccyx. The spinal ridge being the only part of the vertebral column which we can see or feel in the living subject, it is clearly of the greatest importance to study the sUghtest differences which it presents, because it is thus alone that we are able to judge of the extent of deviation of the column; and yet the indications it affords are not absolutely certain, because the pedicles of the vertebrse being susceptible of torsion, a curvature may exist in the bodies of the vertebrae without any corresponding alteration of the spinous processes. 2. On each side of this median ridge are two grooves, broad and shallow in the cervical, broad and deep in the upper part of the dorsal region, contracted at the lower part of the back, enlarged again in the loins and at the base of the sacrum, contracted and finally obliterated at the lower part of this bone. These grooves are filled by a muscular mass, which in robust individuals projects beyond the spine, whilst in those who are emaciated the ridge forms the most prominent part. d4OSTEOLOGY. 40 Lateral surfaces. These present, 1. in front, the sides of the bodies of the vertehroj and their transverse grooves, which are deeper at the sides than in front, also deeper in the loins than in the neck and back; 2. in the dorsal region, facettes for the costo-vertebral articulations ; 3. still more posteriorly the intervertebral foramina. The largest of these foramina is the one situated between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebras: from this point they gradually diminish in size to the upper part of the back : in the cervical region again, they are somevrhat larger ; and in the sacro-coccygeal they are double, with an anterior and a posterior opening*, in consequence of the lateral conjunction of the false vertebrae of the sacrum. In general their dimensions are in pro- portion to the size of the veins which communicate between the intra and the extra-vertebral venous system. Between these foramina are the transverse processes which contribute to form the sides of the posterior grooves, and, between the transverse processes, the articulating processes are visible. The base and the summit of the vertebral column have been already con- sidered, in the special description of the atlas and the fifth lumbar vertebra. Vertebral canal. This canal, into which the intervetebral foramina open, follows all the curves of the spinal column, but does not altogether correspond in shape with its external figure. Tt may be even said that its dimensions, at diiferent heights, bear an inverse proportion to those of the column; thus while the canal is most capacious in the neck, the column, on the other hand, is largest in the loins. It has been said that the widest portions of the canal correspond with the enlargements of the spinal cord : but this is not correct. The capacity of the canal is proportioned to the mobility of the respective por- tion of the column, so that in the most extensive movements, the spinal marrow is effectually guarded from compression: thus it is largest in the neck and loins, and smallest in the back and sacrum. The canal is almost equally well protected in front and behind: anteriorly by the bodies of the vertebrae, posteriorly by the spinous processes, which, as it were, ward off mischief from the spinal canal. Laterally it is defended by the articular and transverse processes. Behind, on each side of the median ridge, it is protected by the laminaj, the intervals of which are filled up by what'are named the j/elloiv ligaments. Any loss of security, occasioned by the existence of these yellow ligaments, is compensated by the followmg cir- cumstances TheUgaments are very short, so that the edges of thelanunaj are almost contiguous. 2. In the neck, where the intervals are greatest, the laminae are so incUned that the inferior border of the one above overlaps the su- perior border of the one below. 3. In the loins, where the intervals are nearly as great, the laminee are small, and their place is in a great measure occupied by the lateral masses and the pedicles, which are proportionally increased in development. It is impossible for an instrument to penetrate into the canal in the lumbar region, excepting between the spinous processes. The same dif- ficulty exists in the cervical region during extension, on account ot the imDri- catton of the lamiuEB. During forcible flexion, however, an mstrument may enter between them, when directed from below upwards. Internal Structure of the VertebrcB. Excepting the thin external layer of compact tissue, the bodies of the ver- , Kr^ nve almost entirely composed of open spongy texture. The different processes onTe other hLd, have a considerable quantity of compact tissue ; processes, ou '-"'^ " undergo any enlargement, they are cellular. The fatn^tSSS^^^^^^ tissue, /his abundance of the spon^ tissueTplains the fact of the weight of the spinal column bemg so m- considerable in proportion to its size.41 VERTEBRAL COLUMN. The venous canals are larger in the vertebrjE than in any other bones. They are for the most part arranged within the body of the bone in the following manner. A single canal directed horizontally, and from behind foi-wards, com- mences at the posterior surface of the body of the vertebra ; at the distance of a few lines from its commencement, it divides into two, three, or four canals, which diverge from each other, and terminate partly upon the anterior sur- face of the bone, partly in the cells in its interior : aU these canals are lined by a thin layer of compact tissue, and perforated by foramina. Development. The development of the vertebral column comprises, 1. That of the ver- tebrte in general; 2. That of certain vertebrae which differ from the rest; and 3. That of the column considered as a whole. Development of the vertebra in general. Each vertebra is developed at first from three points of ossification *, viz. one median for the body, and ttvo lateral for the rest of the vertebral ring. To these primitive points are added, at different periods, five secondary or epiphysary points, viz. one for the summit of each transverse process, one for the summit of the spinous process, and two for the body, the one on the superior surface, the other on the inferior surface, where they form two very thin plates, so that at one time the body of every vertebra of the spine is in fact a triple disk. Lastly, there is a complementary point for each apophysary tubercle of the lumbar vertebrae. The first osseous points generally appear in the laminae ; they precede, by some days, the deposition of bone in the bodies. This law, however, as Beclard has remarked, is by no means general. The first ossific points are visible from the fortieth to the fiftieth day ; that in the body occupies the centre of the cartilage, under the form of an osseous granule, which extends horizontally, so as to present a lenticular aspect. The points of ossification of the laminae appear in the situation of the future trans- verse and articular processes. The complementary osseous points are not formed until the fifteenth or eighteenth year. Sometimes, however, as Bichat has observed, the point for the summit of the spinous process is included among the primitive nuclei, and in such cases it is situated at the place where that process becomes continuous with the laminae. The lateral osseous points are always united together before joining the body of the bone: this union commences about a year after birth ; they are not united with that of the body until about four years and a half. The lateral points are so joined to the central one that they form the sides of the body, and in the cervical region, from their more rapid increase, they con- stitute of themselves fully two-fifths of the body of the vertebra. It is then on the body of the vertebra, or on what is essentially the articular part of the bone, that the three primitive points are united together. The epiphysary points of the transverse and spinous processes, are joined to the rest from the twentieth to the twenty-fifth year; the union of the epiphysary laminae of the bodies is not completed until from the twenty-fifth to the thirtieth year. Development of particular vertebra. Those vertebrae which present great difi"erences of form, present striking differences also in their mode of develop- ment ; such are the atlas, axis, seventh cervical vertebra, first lumbar, and those which constitute the sacrum and coccyx. Atlas. Modern anatomists admit five or six points of ossification for this bone ; one or two for the anterior arch, two for the lateral masses, and two for the posterior arch. I have never observed more than two lateral points, the same n„r »""t?mist8 admit two primitive points for tlic body of the vertebra. It would exceed m.r limits to give an account of the discussions to which tfiis question of ostcogenyTas givS42 OSTEOLOGY. point belonging at once to the lateral masses, and half of the arch on each side. They appear in the following order : — those for the posterior arch make their appearance from the fortieth to the fiftieth day ; those for the an- tei-ior arch not until during the first year after birth. The two osseous points of the posterior arch unite together, those of the anterior arch do the same, and then the anterior is united to the posterior arch. Axis. There are often two osseous points for the body of this bone, and always two lateral ones for the odontoid process: it has, therefore, in all five or six points, -viz. two for the laminaj or posterior arch, one or two for the body, and two for the odontoid process. Meckel and Nesbit admit one other nucleus between the odontoid process and the body, which appears in the course of the first year after birth. The points in the laminte appear from the fortieth to the l^tieth day ; those in the body during the sixth month ; and those in the odontoid process, a short time after. At birth the body of the axis is pro- portionally more developed than that of the other vertebraj. The union of its several parts takes place in the foUowing order:-the two laminaj are joined toeether shortly after birth; the two points of the odontoid process remam dis- tinct during the whole of the first year ; the body and the odontoid process are united m the course of the third year ; and the lamin£e and the body durmg the fourth or fifth year. Seventh cervical vertebra. Independently of the osseous points common to aU the vertebrce, this bone has two others situated on each side of the body in the cartilage which fonns the anterior half of the transverse process. The existence of this point, which was described by Hunauld,but which does not annear to me to be constant, establishes an analogy between the transverse processes of the cervical vertebras and the ribs ; it represents in a rudimentary state the permanent cervical ribs of some animals ; and explams an anomaly wSch is not very uncommon in the human subject, viz. the existence of a "'7^;;'"^T/£m!

Ci The union of the lateral masses with the body takes place much earlier ra the fourth and fifth sacral vertebra;, than in the three others, though these latter first showed osseous points. After the union of the lateral masses, the sacrum is composed of five pieces, which remain separate until the fifteenth year. 2 Union of the sacral vertebrcB with one another. This process commences be- tween the fifteenth and eighteenth year, at which time the epiphysary laminae of the bodies of the sacral vertebrae are developed. At the age of twenty-fav6 the epiphysary laminffi of the iliacsurface of thesacrumaredeveloped. The union commences with the lower vertebrae, and proceeds upwards. The first is not ompletely joined to the others until from the twenty-fifth to the thirtieth year. The union of the body of each vertebra with its epiphysary lammse proceeds from the circumference to the centre, so that in a vertical section of a sacrum, which is completely ossified externally, we often find an intermediate lamina of cartilage. I have observed this cartilage between the first and second sacral vertebrae in subjects of a very advanced age. The union of the pieces of the coccyx takes place sooner than those of the sa- crum. It commences with the fii-st two pieces; the third and fourth then follow; and, in the last place, the second and third are united. Towards the fortietli or fiftieth, or sometimes the sixtieth year, the coccyx becomes united to the sacrum. This junction is later in the female than in the male ; sometimes it never takes place. Development of the spine in general. Up to the end of the first month of conception, the length of the spine is commensurate with that of the body, the extremities as yet only existing under the form of small tubercles. This disproportion between the spine and members is gradually effaced by the elongation of the limbs, so that at birth the vertebral column does not constitute more than fths of the height of the subject. In the adult it forms only |ths. All the parts which concur in forming the canal for the defence of the spinal cord, are developed prior to those which are specially devoted to locomotion, as is shown in the development of the laminae, as compared with that of the body and processes. The ossification of the laminae proceeds in regular suc- cession from above downwards, from the neck to the sacro-coccygeal region. The ossification of the bodies takes a different coui'se, commencing in the dorsal region as a centre, and proceeding to either extremity of the column. The ossification of the bodies of the vertebrae commences in the centre of the bone ; and accordingly, if the spine of a foetus be dried, the cartilages shrink, and the series of osseous nodules which represent the bodies of the vertebrte, look like grains of Indian corn strung together. In the first periods of its development, the spinal column presents the fol- lowing remarkable differences from its subsequent condition. It is completely devoid of curvature, and instead of resembling in shape a pyramid with the base below, it is precisely the reverse, the base of the pyramid being uppermost. As the chUd grows up, the -spine gradually acquires those characters which it presents in the adult. In the old subject it is always more or less bent forwards. It is not uncommon to meet with several dorsal or lumbar vertebrae more or less completely united by a layer of bone, which forms a sort of sheath or clasp. To this 1 have applied the name of anchylosis by invagination. THE SKULL.

The skull is the most complicated portion of the skeleton. It has been moi-e minutely investigated than any other part, probably on account of the difficulty ot the study. It is composed of two distinct portions : one, the cranium de-44 OSTEOLOGY. signed to enclose and protect the brain; the other the face, which affords lodgment to almost all the organs of the senses, and at the same time is em- ployed in the function of mastication. The Cranium. The cranium {Kpavos, a helmet) is a round osseous case, composed of eight hones that is, of eight pieces, distinct and separable after the complete deve- lopment of the skeleton. Four of these are single, and placed on the median line • viz (counting from behind forwards), the occipital, the sphenoid, the ethmoid, and the frontal: the remaining four are in pairs, and are situated laterally • viz the two parietal and the two temporal. To these must be added the small supernumerary bones, denominated ossa wormiana,or triquelra. The Occipital Bone {figs. 9. and 10.). The occipital bone occupies the posterior, inferior, and middle portion of the cranium, a great part of the base of which it constitutes.* Below it is articulated with the vertebral column; in front with the sphenoid; and it is, as it were, wedged in between the parietal and temporal bones of the right and left sides. It is broad and symmetrical; in shape an irregular segment of a spheroid, notched round the circumference. It has an anterior and a poste- rior surface, and a circumference, having/our borders and four angles. The posterior or cutaneous surface (fig. 9.) is convex, and presents the inferior orifice of the occipital foramen, {\,fig. 9. ; d, ^* .r" „ - fig. 21.) (foramen magnum), the largest of all the fo- ramina in the skeleton, excepting the sub-pubic, or obturator foramen of the os innominatum. It gives passage to the spinal marrow with its envelopes, the spinal accessory nerves, and vertebral arteries. In front of the foramen is the inferior surface of the basilar process (2, fig. 9.; n,fig. 21.) which forms the bony roof of the pharynx; it is placed horizontally, is rough, and has a ridge in the median line more or less prominent in different subjects. Behind the foramen, and in the median line, is the external occi- pital ridge {perpendicular spine) (3 4, fig. 9.; c a, fig. 21 ) extending ft-om the posterior edge of the fora- men to the external occipital protuberance. This projection is wanting in some individuals, and in others its place is occupied by a depression On each side of the ridg; are unequal surfaces bounded above by a Ime with the concavity Inokine downwards. Thus, the superior semicircular line (5 5, fig. 9., a o,jig. 20 comm^ces at the occipital protuberance (4, fig. 9.; a, fig. 20.) and pro- ceeds Sontally outwards."^ The irregular surface included between this line and the foramen! is again divided by a line whose concavity is directed up- wards (-6 6, fiq. 9.), and which is called the inferior semicircular line. On each Se of the occipital foramen, and towards the fore part are the ; 7.C r7 7 9 • e fiQ. 21.), two articular eminences, convex, elliptical, di- condylcs (7 ^l^^d-^-'/^^d- ^ ^-^^^^^ mwards, their surfaces lookmg rected from articulate with the atlas.

It presents, 1. The internal orifice of the occi- pital foramen ( 1, fig. 10.), which is lai-ger than the external. 2. Before the foramen the basilar groove (2), sloping gently from above down- wards and backwards: the sides of the groove are marked by other very small grooves, which concur in forming the inferior petrosal groove. 3 On each side the occipital foramen, and to- wards the fore part, is a projection (3 3) which corresponds with the condyle, and particularly with the anterior condyloid canal. 4. A httle more external and posterior is a small portion of a groove (4), which contributes to form the ter- mination of the lateral sinus. 5. Behind the foramen are the four occipital fossa, two superior or cerebral (5 5), and two inferior or cerebellar (6 6), separated from each other by a crucial ridge. The vertical branch of this ridge 5 a) joins the termination of the sagittal groove above ; below it s formed by the internal occipital crest (7). The horizontal branches (ff 6) cor- respond with the grooves for the lateral sinuses of the dura mater The in- .ternat occipital protuberance (g) is situated at the confluence of the four branches. The right and left lateral grooves are rarely of the same size and depth; the right is generally the larger, and forms by itself the contmuation of the sagittal or longitudinal groove. , ^, The circumference presents four borders and four angles. The superior or parietal borders (a b, a b}, which are remarkable for the length of their indentations, articulate with the posterior borders of the parietal bones forming the lambdoidal suture. , The inferior or temporal borders (6 c, b c) are divided into two equal por- tions by the jugular eminence (d), which articulates with the temporal bone. The part (6 d) above this eminence is slightly denticulated, and united to the mastoid portion of the temporal bone; the part (d c) below is thick, sinuous, but without indentations, and articulates by juxta-position with the petrous portion of the temporal. In front of the jugular eminence is a deep notch, sometimes divided into two parts by a process of bone, which contributes to form the posterior lacerated foramen. The superior angle (a) is acute, and is received into the retreating angle, formed by the. posterior borders of the parietal bones. Its place is sometimes supplied by a Wormian bone. In the young subject the posterior fontanelle is placed here. The inferior angle (c) is truncated and very thick ; it forms the basilar process, which presents a rough articular surface for union with the body of the sphenoid. The connexion is established by means of a cartilage, which becomes ossified at a very early period, so that many anatomists de- scribe the sphenoid and occipital as one bone. * The lateral angles {b b) sre very obtuse, and are received into the retiring angle formed by the union of the parietal with the temporal bone. At these angles the lateral and posterior fontanelles are situated. Connexions. The occipital articulates with six bones—the two parietal, the two temporal, the sphenoid, and the atlas. Structure. The part of this bone which forms the occipital fossse consists ahnost exclusively of compact tissue. It is here extremely thin, especially at * A reference to Comparative Anatomy would seem to justify tliis view, for in some inferior animals the b.xsilar process and the sphenoid are hut one piece.OSTEOLOGY. 46 the inferior fossec. In the rest of its extent there is spongy tissue between the two tables. The external table is much thicker and less brittle than the internal, which is named vitreous on account of its fragility. The spongy tissue is very abundant in the condyles and in the basilar process. Development. The occipital bone is developed from four points—one for the squamous portion, that is, the part of the bone behind the foramen mag- num ; one for each lateral condyloid portion of the occipital, and one for the an- terior or basilar portion. These four parts are considered by some anatomists as so many distinct bones, wliich they describe under the names of posterior or superior occipital, lateral occipitals, and anterior occipital or basilar bone. The first point of ossification appears in the squamous or back part of the bone, under the form of a small oblong plate placed transversely in the situ- ation of the protuberances. 1 have never seen this piece formed by two lateral points. The part of the bone of which we are speaking is always vi- sible towards the middle of the second month. The condyloid portions make their appearance next, and lastly the basilar portion, which I have never seen developed from two lateral points. In a foetus of two months and a half, the ossified part of this process presented the appearance of a linear streak, si- tuated exactly in the median line, and directed from before backwards. The four points of ossification are finally united at the foramen magnum. Anatomists, however, are not at all agreed respecting the number of points of ossification. Meckel admits eight for the posterior part of the bone, two for the condyles, and one for the basilar process. Beclard, on the other hand, admits only four in the posterior part of the bone. His opinion is founded upon the existence of four fissures or divisions at the circumference of this portion ; viz. one at the superior angle, which sometimes gives to the posterior fontanelle the lozenge shape of the anterior; one below, which is nothing more than a slight notch in the back of the foramen magnum; and two on each side, corresponding to the posterior lateral fontaneUes. The opinion of Meckel is perhaps grounded upon certain abnormal cases, in which this part of the bone is divided into a considerable number of pieces resembling so many Wormian bones united by suture. T/ie Frontal or Coronal Bone {figs. 11 and 12.). The frontal bone is situated at the anterior part of the skull, and above the face It is symmetrical, and represents a considerable segment of a hoUow sDhe're From its shape it has been compared to a shelL The superior three fourths are curved, placed vertically, but more or less inclined from downwards and forwards ; the inferior fourth is flat and horizontal. It has an anterior, a posterior, and an inferior surface, and three borders. The anterior cutaneous or frontal surface is smooth and convex ; there is a suture in the median line m young subjects, which in the adult is obUterated, leaving scarcely any trace of its existence, excepting at its ter- mination below. At this spot there is a promi- nence named nasal eminence or glabella (or middle frontal eminence) (l,^5f. 11.)- On the sides of the median line proceedmg from above downwards we observe two smooth surfaces; then the frontal eminences (2 2), two projections which are most strongly developed in young subiects; and below these on each side of the gla- •/• -Ano on arched elevation which forms the margin ot ^^^^47 FRONTAL BONE frontal eminence by a sort of crest running upwards and backwards (a): it forms the anterior part of the temporal fossa. i •„ k *i. The anterior surface of the frontal bone is separated from the skin by the frontal, orbicular, and corrugator superciUi muscles, and the anterior portion of the cranial aponeurosis. . „,-j,n„ „ The infJor or orbito-etlmoidal surface (fig. 2.) presents in the middle a large rectangular notch (6), which extends the whole length of this surface from before backwards. This notch, which is named eth- moidal, because it receives the ethmoid bone, has, 1. In front, and in the median line, a pro- longation, denominated the nasal spine (7): this spine is rough in front for articulation with the proper nasal bones: behind it is marked by two grooves, separated by a ver- tical ridge; the ridge joins the perpendicular lamella of the ethmoid, and the two grooves form part of the vault of the nasal fossae. 2. Farther back and on each side is the large opening of the frontal sinuses. 3. The two borders of the notch are marked with (6 d, b d) incomplete cells, which join with those of the ethmoid. 4. On the same borders there are two or sometimes three small grooves, which contribute to form the anterior and posterior internal orbi- tary canals. On each side of the notch is the orbital plate (9 9), triangular and concave, especially towards the external margin, where there is an excavation for the lachrymal gland {foss(R glandula laclmjmalis). At the internal margin there is a small depression for the attachment of the cartilaginous pulley, in which the tendon of the superior oblique muscle of the eye is reflected. The posterior or cerebral surface is concave, and marked by eminences and depressions corresponding to the sulci and convolutions of the brain, and by furrows for arterial branches. In the median line is a longitudinal groove, the sides of which unite below, and form the frontal ridge, which terminates in a foramen, called foramen cceciim. The ridge is sometimes absent, and oc- casionally the place of the foramen is occupied by a notch, completed by the ethmoid, as already described. On each side of the median line are the frontal jfossce, which are deeper than the corresponding eminences on the out- side seem to indicate : below are the orbital prominences, which look directly upwards, and forma retiring angle* with the frontal fossae ; they are covered with acuminated eminences, which are received into the anfractuosities of the brain. The superior or parietal border (b a b) is semicircular, denticulated, and cut obliquely at the expense of its internal plate above, and of its external below, and at the sides. In the middle, it forms a very obtuse angle (a), which is received into the retiring angle formed by the parietal bones. In young subjects this angle is wanting; in its situation the anterior angle of the anterior fontanelle is placed. The inferior or sphenoidal border {b b b) is very short, thin, and straight, interrupted by the ethmoidal notch, and adapted to the smaller wings of the sphenoid. It terminates externally, at its junction with the superior border, by two triangular surfaces slightly indented, which articulate with the greater wings of the sphenoid. The anterior or orbito-nasal border {cc,fig.\\.) presents in the centre the nasal notch (d d), articulated in the middle with the nasal bones, and at the sides with the ascending processes of the superior maxillae. At the bottom of This retiring angle measures pretty exactly the facial angle.48 OSTEOLOGY. this notch is the anterior surface of the nasal spine. On each side we observe the orbital arch (c </), more sharp and thin towards its outer end. At the junction of the internal with the two external thirds of this arch, is situated a foramen (e), or more frequently a notch converted into a foramen by a liga- ment ; it is called the superciliary or supraorbital foramen, and gives passage to the frontal vessels and nerves.' At the bottom of this notch there are gene- rally one or more vascular openings, which lead into the diploe, and are the terminations of venous canals, which run for a considerable way within the bone. The orbital arch terminates on each side by a process; the inner one, internal orbital process ((Z), is broad and thin, and articulates with the os unguis ; the external (c) is thick, and unites with the malar bone. Connexions. The frontal is articulated with twelve bones—the two parietal, the sphenoid, the ethmoid, the two nasal, and two malar bones, the ossa unguis, and the two superior maxillary. Internal structure. The vertical portion and external orbital processes are very thick -, the horizontal part is very thin, and hence the facility with which instruments can penetrate the cranium through the roof of the orbit. It contains large cavities, frontal sinuses (a, figs. 23 and 24.), which open in the ethmoidal notch, and add greatly to the thickness of the bone at its lower part. They are separated by a septimi, which is often bent to one side, and is generally imperfect. The capacity of these sinuses is very variable ; they often extend throughout the whole of the orbital plates, almost to the edge of tne sphenoid. The study of these sinuses, which are connected with the organ of smelling, is of great importance in determining the facial angle. Development. The frontal bone is developed from two lateral points of ossification, which appear about the middle of the second month, and com- mence in the orbital arches. At this time the edges are in approximation below but above are separated by an angular interval, which forms the anterior angle of the anterior fontanelle. The two pieces are united by suture during the first year; it is gradually effaced afterwards, bemg longest visible at its inferior termination, though it is uncommon to find it permanent throueh life. Independently of these general changes, which the bone under- goes in the course of its development, there are also certain peculiar alterations in which the sinuses are concerned. These cavities make their appearance during the first year, and gradually increase in size, not only up to the period of manhood, but even to old age. The Sphenoid Bone (^figs. 13 and U.). This bone has received its name from the Greek word <T^h' (a wedge), because it is inserted like a wedge between the other bones. It is situated at Because ^ o ^^fgyjop ^nd middle part of the base of ■■^mfp^-X. ■ -fv. ^-^^-^4^^.. the cranium l^fig. 23.). Almost aU anatomists agree in considering it as a separate bone; but Soemmering and Meckel describe it as united with the occipital, under the name of basilar or spheno-occipital bone.

A transverse gi-oove optw groove (6), on which the commissure of the optic nerves rests and which is continuous on each side with the optic foramen (11).* 3 A deep quadri- lateral fossa (c), in which the pituitary gland is lodged, called the^e^/a cica, supra-sphenoidal, or piluilary fossa. 4. On the sides of this fossa two grooves, named cavernous or carotid grooves, because they correspond to the cai-otid arteries and cavernous sinuses. Anteriorly the cavernous groove gives attachment to the ligament of Zinn, a tendon which gives origin to three muscles of the eye. Near its anterior termination, and between it and the pituitary fossa, \s th^ viiddle clinoid process], generally nothmg more than a simple tubercle, but sometimes sufficiently developed to unite eithei' with the anterior or with the posterior clinoid processes, the former case being the more common. 5. Behind the pituitary fossa we observe a quadrilateral plate {,d), directed obliquely from above downwards and backwards; its anterior sur- face forms part of the fossa, its posterior surface is continuous with the basUar groove, its lateral edges are notched for the sixth pair of nerves, and the su- perior border which separates the basUar groove and the pituitary fossa^ pre- sents, at each extremity, an angular process (e), the posterior clinoid (from kKIvv, a bed, from a supposed resemblance of the anterior and posterior clmoid processes to the four corners of a bed). 6. From the lateral and anterior parts of the body of the sphenoid arise two triangular processes (n o, n o), flattened above and below, extremely thin and fragile, and directed transversely : these are denominated the orbital or lesser ivings of the sphenoid (ala minores), or the wings of Ingrassius, from the anatomist who first gave a good description of them. The superior surface of these processes is flat, and corresponds to the anterior lobes of the brain; the inferior surface forms part of the roof of the orbits; the anterior edge is bevilled below, and rests upon the posterior border of the frontal and the ethmoid ; the posterior edge is thin and sharp externally, thicker internally, and divides the anterior and middle fossse of the base of the cranium; the summit (o) is pointed, and' hence the processes are sometimes called ensiform or xiphoid; the base presents the internal orifice of the optic ca- nal or foramen (1), which is directed outwards and forwards, and gives passage to the optic nerve and the ophthalmic artery. The base of the lesser wing terminates behind in a projecting angle (n), which forms the anterior clinoid process; and behind this is a deep notch, sometimes a foramen, for the carotid artery. Occasionally the anterior are united to the posterior clinoid processes by a long bridge of bone. All the part of the sphenoid in front of the sella turcica, including the smaller wings, forms the anterior sphenoid of some modem anatomists ; the remaining portion of the bone constitutes the posterior sphenoid. The separation of these two parts, which is but temporary in man, existing only during the early months of fcBtal life, is permanent in quadrupeds. The inferior or guttural sicrface of the body (fig. 14.) presents, in the me- dian line, a ridge or crest, called the beak ^ ' y__, of the sphenoid or rostrum ((/); it is more prominent anteriorly than posteriorly, is received into a groove of the vomer, and is continuous with the anterior ridge of the body of the bone. On each side is a deep furrow concealed by a lamella (on each side of g), under which the edges of the vomer are insinuated. At the bottom of this fur- row is seen the orifice of a temporarj' ca- nal, which exists only in young subjects, * fThe groove is formed on an eminence named tiie olivary process.! Wiien tVie middle clinoid processes arc united with tne posterior, they are then also joined to the anterior. VOL. I.

This canal is the trace of the still incomplete union of the anterior and posterior sphenoid ; it disappears as soon as the sinuses within the bone are developed. More externally, and on the same surface, is situated a small groove running from before backwards, which forms part of the pterygo- palatine canal, along which an artery of the same name passes. Still more ex- ternaUy are the pterygoid-processes (6 m /») (jr-ripvl, ala), two large projections directed perpendicularly downwards. In front their surface is broad above, where it forms part of the pterygo-maxiUary fossa, and rough below for arti- culation with the palate bone. Behind is a deep fossa, into which the internal pterygoid muscle is inserted: it is named the pterygoid fossa, and is formed by two laminse, named the external and internal pterygoid plates, of which the ex- ternal (h) is the broader, and the internal (m) the longer. At the upper part of the internal plate is an elUptical depression caUed the scaphoid fossa, which gives at- tachment to the circumflexuspalati muscle. The internal surface of the pterygoid process contributes to form the external wall, and posterior opening of the nasal fossae (h i fiq 25 ). The outer surface of the external plate is broad, forms part of the zygomatic fossa, and gives attachment to the external ptei-ygoid muscle. The base of the pterygoid process is pierced from before backwards by the vidian or pterygoid canal (6 6, fig. U.) : its summit is deeply bifurcated to re- ceive the tuberosity of the palate bone. The internal branch of this bifurca- tion (internal pterygoid plate) is very delicate, and is curved into a hook-like process (s) {hamular process), round which is reflected the tendon of the circuni- flexus OT tensor palati mnscle. , „ , , -j * The anterior or ethmoidal surface of the body of the sphenoid presents, 1 above and in the median Une, a small horizontal projectmg angle (J, figs. 13 and 14.), which articulates with the posterior border of the cribriform nlate of the ethmoid: 2. below this, a vertical ridge (f g, fig. 14,.) con- dnuous with the septum of the sphenoidal sinuses, and articulating with the peipendicular lamella of the ethmoid: 3. on each side, the openmgs of the sphenoidal sinuses (7 7).

This surface is divided into two parts by a transverse ridge; the superior or temporal (/,/jr. 14.) forms part ot the fossa of the same name, and gives attachment to the temporal muscle ; the inferior (p) forms the upper part of the zygomatic fossa, and gives attach- ment to the external pterygoid muscle. On this last part we perceive the in- ferior orifices of the oval and spinous foramina. Anterior or orbital surface. This surface {w w) is four-sided and smooth, and forms the greater part of the external wall of the orbit. Its superior border unites with the frontal bone; the inferior forms part of the spheno- maxillanj fissure. The internal border contributes to form the sphenoidal fissure, and has a small tubercle near its inner termination. The external joins the malar bone. Internal border. This border is convex, and commences m front by a triangular and very rough surface (yy,fig. 13.), which articulates with a cor- responding surface on the frontal bone; it then forms part of the sphenoidal fissure (2), and finally bends outwards to join the petrous portion of the temporal bone; in this place it is grooved for the lodgment of the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube. The sphenoidal fissure, or foramen laceruvi superius (2 2, figs. 13 and 14.), partly formed in the way we have described, is completed by the lesser wing of the sphenoid. Wide at its internal extremity, it becomes narrow at its outer end, where it is closed by the frontal bone at o. It gives passage to the third, fourth, the ophthalmic branch of the fiftjh, and the sixth pair of nerves, to the ophthalmic vein, and to a prolongation of the dura mater. At the internal extremity of the fissure, there is a furrow, which is occasionally converted into a foramen for the passage of a recurrent branch of the ophthalmic artery, which goes to the dura mater. '1 he external border is concave, bevilled on the outside superiorly and on the inside inferiorly, for articulation with the temporal bone. The anterior extremity is very thin (behind y, fig. 13.) and bevilled on the inner side for articulation with the anterior and inferior angle of the parietal. The posterior extremity presents a vertical process (z), the spine or spinous process of the sphenoid, which is received into the angle formed by the union of the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bone, and gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the inferior maxilla, and the external or anterior muscle of the malleus. Connections. The sphenoid articulates with all the bones of the cranium, and with the palatine, vomer, and malar bones of the face. Structure. The most remarkable circumstance in the structure of the sphenoid, is the presence of the sinuses, which convert the body of the bone into two or more cells (."j, fig. 22.). The compact tissue prevails in the lesser and the greater wings, and in the pterygoid processes, the thick part only of these containing spongy substance. _ Development. In the foBtus, as we have already mentioned, the sphenoid is divided into two quite distinct parts: — 1. An anterior sphenoid, consisting of the lesser wings and the portion of the body which supports them ; and, 2. A posterior sphenoid, formed of the greijt wings and the part of the body which corresponds to the sella turcica. E 252 OSTEOLOGY. 1. The anterior sphenoid is developed from four points of ossification ; two for the body, and two for the alaj minores.* 2. The posterior sphenoid is also developed from four pomts ; two for the body, and two for the great wings. « • Besides these eight points, there are two others on each side ; one for the m- ternal plate of the pterygoid process, and one for the sphenoidal turbinated bone; so that the whole number of centres of ossification of the sphenoid is ^'^Theosseous points of the great wings are the first to appear: they are visible from the fortieth to the forty-fifth day; a short time afterwards, those of the lesser wings, which are situated on the outside of the optic foramen. At the end ot the second month the osseous points of the body of the posterior sphenoid are distinct; at the end of the third month, those of the body of the anterior sphenoid, and the internal pterygoid plates : the sphenoidal turbinated bones be-in to ossify, according to Beclard, in the seventh month of mtra-uterine life; according to Bertln, in the second year after birth. The two points of the body of the posterior sphenoid are united from the third to the fourth month; the great wings are jomed to the body in the course of five or six months after birth. The two points of the body of the an- terior sphenoid are joined to those of the smaU wings about the third or fourth month; they then unite together in the median plane from about the eighth to he ninth month. The union of the internal pterygoid plates takes place during the sixth month. + The anterior and posterior sphenoid are united from the eightb o the ninth month. The sphenoidal turbinated bones are '^"t Joined to the body of the bone untU from the fifteenth to the eighteenth year. The othei changes which the sphenoid afterwards undergoes, are connected with the de- velopment of the sinuses. It is miited with the occipital bone from the eight- eenth to the twenty-fifth year. The Ethmoid Bone (figs. 15 and 16.)- The ethmoid is so named from the Greek word Wh,, a sieve because it is neSrated wi h a number of foramina : it is placed in the anterior and middle Tan of therase of the cranium, but belongs rather to the face and nasa fossa.

This is the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, continuous with the base of the crista gaUi, quadnlateral, often deflected to one side, and forms part of the septum narium (1, 2, 3, 4,^sr. 22.) : in front, it articulates with the nasal spine of'the frontal bone, and with the proper bones of the nose; behind with the anterior crest of the sphenoid; and below, with the vomer, and the cartilage of the septum. The anterior border of the cribriform plate articulates with the frontal. _ The pos- terior is usually notched for the reception of the spine, or pro- cess ( f. Jigs 13 aiid 14.), which surmounts the median ridge of the sphenoid. The lateral masses are cuboid in figure, and formed of large irregular cells, which together are named the labyrinth. They have six surfaces : in the supe- rior surface we observe several imperfect ceUs {d d,fig. 15.), which in the united state are completed and, as it were, roofed in by those we have already described as existing on each side of the ethmoidal notch of the frontal. We find also two or three grooves, which join with similar grooves in the frontal bone, and form the internal orbitary canals. On the inferior surface we perceive thin ir- regularly twisted laminae, which narrow the opening of the maxillary sinuses. The most considerable of these has received the name of unciform or great process of the ethmoid : it is a curved plate which arises from the inferior surface of the transverse septa, which close the anterior ethmoidal cells, and is placed between the anterior extremity of the middle turbinated bone, and the OS planum or lamina papyracea, to be aftei-wards described; it sometimes arti- culates with the inferior turbinated bone. The anterior surface presents half cells, which are covered by the os unguis and the ascending process of the max- illary bone. On the posterior surface we see the posterior extremities of the superior and middle turbinated bones, and of the superior and middle meatus, and a convex uneven surface -which corresponds with the posterior eth- moidal cells. This surface articulates with the sphenoid above, and with the palate bone below. The external surface is formed by a smooth quadri- lateral plate i_e,fig. 15.) placed vertically and very thin, to which the ancients gave the name of lamina papyracea or os planum. It has an elongated rectan- gular form, is slightly curved upon itself, and constitutes a great part of the in- ternal waU of the orbit. The superior border articulates with the frontal, and assists in forming the orifice of the internal orbital canals; the inferior articu- lates -with the maxillary and palate bones, the anterior with the os unguis, and the posterior with the sphenoid and palate bones. The internal surface constitutes the greatest part of the external wall of the nasal fossaj: on it we observe, in front, a rough quadrilateral surface marked • Morgagni mentions the case of an asthmatic subject, in whom the crista galli was so ob- liquely placed that the ethmoidal groove on one side was very much contracted, and consider- ably enlarged on the other. There was a much greater number of foramina on one side than 08 the other. £ 354 OSTEOLOGY. by grooves and canals, which lodge the ramifications of the olfactory nerve; behind, two thin plates, twisted upon themselves like certain shells: they are the turbinated or spongy bones of the ethmoid, or concha: of the ethmoid. The superior (b,fiy. 35.) is the smaller, and is sometimes named concha o/Morgayni; Bertin has seen it double. The inferior ic,Jig. 37.) is larger, and forms the middle concha; it artictdates by its posterior extremity with the palate bone, and its superior border is continuous with a transverse septum, which stretches across to the lower edge of the os planum, and partially closes the middle or frontal cells. The superior and middle turbinated bones are separated by a horizontal groove called the superior meatus of the nasal fossae (between b and c,fig. 37.), at the superior part of which appears an opening of communication with the posterior ethmoidal cells. Below the middle turbinated bone is a similar groove (between c and d,fig. 37.) running from before backwards, and forming part of the middle meatus of the nose. Anteriorly it leads into a cell, the lower part of which is broad and the upper narrow, whence it has received the name of infundibulum. This cell communicates directly with the frontal sinuses, and by a small aperture with the anterior ethmoidal cells. Internal structure. The ethmoid is composed of extremely thin and fragile plates arranged in more or less irregular cells, having a hexaedral, pentaedral, or tetraedral shape. They are disposed in distinct series, which have no communication with each other. The anterior cells are the largest and most numerous ; they open into the middle meatus by the infundibulum ; the pos- terior open into the superior meatus. There is a little spongy substance in the crista galli, which is even sometimes hollowed into a small sinus which communicates with the frontal sinuses. There is also spongy substance in the turbinated bones, and here, by a remarkable exception, it occupies the surface. The specific lightness of the ethmoid is such that it floats in water, and its extreme brittleness is readily explained by its spongy structure. Connections. The ethmoid is connected with thirteen bones : the frontal, the sphenoid, the ossa unguis, the superior maxillary, the inferior turbinated, the nasal, the palate bones, and the vomer. Development. The ossification of the ethmoid does not commence until the fifth month. It begins in the lateral masses, and more particularly m the os planum ; shortly afterwards the spongy bones make their appearance. The middle portion is not ossified until after birth. The crista galh and the con- tiffuous part of the perpendicular plate, and the cribriform plate, become bony between the sixth month and the first year. At the end of the first year, the cribriform plate is united to the lateral masses. In the foetus, at the tuU tune, the lateral masses are so little developed, that their internal and external waUs are almost contiguous. The cells are completely formed about the fourth or fifth year. The Parietal Bones {figs. 17 and 18.). The parietal bones are so called, because they form the greatest part of the sides of the head. They are two in number, the right and the left; but sometimes in the adult they are united so as to form only one bone. They occupy the summit and sides of the head. In shape they are quadrilateral, and much thicker above than below, so that a force applied to the crown of the head often causes a fracture of the lower parts of these bones. The parietal bones have two faces, four bor- ^/-^ .

The parietal fossa, a concavity corresponding to the prominence of the same name, is situated in the middle of this surface. The superior or sagittal border (a bfig. 17 and 18.) is the longest, it is thick and denticulated, and by its union with the op- posite bone foi-ms the sagittal suture. On its internal surface there is a furrow along its Fi/;. 18. <i whole extent, which, with that in the op- posite bone, forms the groove for the longitudinal sinus Near this border is sometimes found a foramen (c), {foramen parietale), of very variable dimensions, which opens into the posterior part of the groove and transmits a vein. The inferior or temporal border {d e) is the shortest: it is concave, thin, and very obliquely cut on the outside, so as to resemble a scale with radiated fur- rows ; hence its name {margo squamosus): it articulates with the squamous portion of the temporal bone. , • j x i The anterior or frontal border (Jb e) is less thick and less deeply indented than the occipital edge; it is bevilled externaUy above, and internally below, so as to articulate with the frontal bone, which presents a precisely opposite ar- rangement. . . J J • 1 i The posterior or occipital border (a d) is very deeply indented, and articulates with the superior border of the occipital by the lambdoid suture. Of the/oar angles, the two superior are right angles ; of the inferior, the anterior or sphe- noidal (e) is acute, and rendered very thin by the sloping of the anterior and inferior edges of the bone. Inside this angle is situated the principal furrow, or sometimes canal, which lodges the middle meningeal artery and veins: surgeons therefore recommend this angle to be avoided in performing the operation of trepanning. The posterior or mastoid angle {d) is, as it were, truncated, and is received into the retreating angle formed by the union of the mastoid and squamous portions of the temporal bone. Internally it is grooved for the reception of part of the lateral sinus (e,Jig. 22.). Connections. The parietal is articulated with five bones : the frontal, the occipital, the temporal, the sphenoid, and the opposite parietal. Above it is separated from the skin by the cranial aponeurosis only, and consequently it exposes a large extent of surface to the action of external agents: hence fractures of this bone are very common, and they are more frequently than other fractures accompanied by effusions of blood, on account of the conuection with the middle meningeal artery and vein. The internal structure is quite similar to that of the frontal. As in that bone, we find venous canals traversing long tracts in the substance of the diploe. Development. The parietal bone is developed from one point of ossification alone, which appears in the situation of the protuberance. Its first traces are K 456 OSTEOLOGY. observed about the forty-fifth day. The angles are the last parts of the bone which are developed : their absence gives rise in part to the six fontanelles of the cranium. Tlie Temporal Bones ( fgs. 19 and 20.)- The temporal bones are so called from being situated in the locality of the temples. They are two in number, and occupy part of the sides and base of the cranium, below the parietal bones, above the inferior maxillary, in front of the occipital, and behind the sphenoid. The temporal bone contains the complicated apparatus of the organ of hearing. Its figure is very irregular, and therefore, in order to facilitate the descrip- tion, we shall consider it as divided into three parts; the squamous, the mastoid, and the petrous portions. Squammis portion. The squamous portion has the form of a semicircular p. jg scale {ale, figs. 19 and 20.), bearing a ' considerable resemblance to one of the valves of certain shell-fish : it occupies the anterior and superior part of the bone. It is by far the thinnest part of the craniimi; and hence the common but well-founded notion of the danger of blows upon the temple, although this danger is much les- sened by the presence of the zygomatic arch and the temporal muscle. The external surface (J, fig. 19.) forms part of the temporal fossa; it is smooth, con- vex, and marked by vascular furrows. At its lower portion is situated the zijgomatic process (m n) {C^vyviio, \ imn), so called because it unites the sides of the cranium to the face : it is also named ansa capitis, and is one of the longest processes of the skeleton. At its origm it is broad and directed outwards; it then gradually dimmishes in size, and bends so as to turn horizontally forwards and a little outwards : it is flattened from without inwards. The external surface is convex, and may be easily traced under the skin ; the internal surface is concave; the superior border convex and thin; the inferior concave, thick, and much shorter; and the ex- tremity (m) is cut from below upwards and forwards, and denticulated for a - tachment with a corresponding surface on the malar bone. The base of this process is grooved above, and serves as a pulley for the reflection of part of the temporal muscle. Posteriorly it separates into two portions or the m- ferior (o) of these is the larger ; it is transverse, covered with cartilage, and bounds the rienoid cavity inftont, serving also to increase the articular surface in the ioint^of the lower jaw. The superior {n) is longitudinal or antero- posteriorTn its direction : it also is bifurcated, one branch directed upward^ and forming part, of the temporal semicircular Une, the other passing between the aSrf meatus and the glenoid cavity. At the pomt of junction of the two roots the^e is a tubercle which gives insertion to the external lateral bga- rTnt of the l(^er i^aw. Between the two roots we observe the glenoid cavity malleus (process of Raw). . [The eorda tyn,paul. according to the author passes through a .pedal orifice hy the s,de ol the glenoid flssufe. See description of the ear, infrA.^TEMPORAL BONES. 57 The internal surface of the squamous portion (g. Jig. 20.) presents a concayity ine iniernai surja proportionally greater than the convexity on the outside : it is marked by the ordinary inequah- ties, and is generaUy traversed towards the upper part by a horizontal vascular furrow, running from before backwards. The circumference (a b c) forms about three- fourths of a circle: it is very obliquely cut in- ternally in its two posterior thirds, which unite with the parietal: the anterior third is thicker and bevilled externally, it unites with the sphenoid. Mastoid portion (c e d, figs. 19 and 20.) The mastoid portion is very prominent in adults, but only slightly developed in young sub- iects : it occupies the posterior and inferior part of the bone. ^ The e.ta-nd surface (fig. 19.) is convex, and rough, tei-minating below and in front in a nipple-shaped process, the mastoid process (e). Inside ot ttus is a deep groove called digastric {fossa digastrica), because it gives origin to the muscle of that name. Still more internally there is a very small groove, pa- rallel to the last, in which the trachelo-mastoid muscle is inserted. Uehmd tlie mastoid process we observe the mastoid foramen, an opening which transmits the mastoid artery and vein, but which is subject to numerous varieties m its size and position. Above the process is a rough surface, for muscular attach- ments. „ , , , 1 J. ■ The internal surface is concave, and forms part of the lateral and posterior foss£B of the cranium; we observe on this surface a deep and broad semi-cy- lindrical gi-oove (h i,fig. 20.), which lodges the greater portion of the lateral sinus. At the bottom of this groove the mastoid foramen opens by one or more apertures. There is generally a considerable difference in size between the grooves on the right and left side of the head. The circumference, very thick and indented, unites in front with the cir- cumference of the squamous portion, forming a retiring angle (c), which is occupied by the posterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, and then curves round in a semicircle to join the occipital bone by means of a thick uneven edge. Petrous portion; Rocherov pyramid{c i d v,fig. 20.) Petrous process. This part of the bone is placed between the squamous and the mastoid portion, re- sembling a pyramid projecting forwards and inwards into the cavity of the cranium. Its name sufficiently indicates the extreme hardness of its osseous structure,—a circumstance very important in relation to its functions (for this part of the bone serves as the receptacle of the vibratory apparatus of the ear), and at the same time calculated to explain the frequency of fractures in this situation. It has the form of a truncated pyramid with three faces, separated by three borders. The inferior surface, which is seen at the base of the cranium, is very irre- gular, and presents the following objects, in an order from without inwards: — 1. A long, slender process (A) generaUy from twelve to fifteen lines, sometimes two inches in length. This process, which has been denominated styloid, is, in man, usually continuous with the rest of the bone, but occasionally it is articulated by a movable joint, as in the lower animals, where it is always se- parate, and is known by the name of styloid hone. 2. Behind this process, belrween it and the mastoid, is a sort of fossa, at the bottom of which we find, besides one or two accessory foramina, the stylo-mastoid foramen ( y,fig. 21.), the inferior aperture of a canal improperly called the agwe- f/uc< q/Pa//o;5zM*, which transmits the facial nerve. 3. Inside of the styloid process, and the stylo-mastoid foramen, is a triangular surface, called the ju- * [Fallopius knew that this canal tranimitted a nerve ; he named it aqueduct merely on ac- count of its direction.]58 'OSTEOLOGY. gular, -which joins with a corresponding part of the occipital bone. 4. A little within and behind the styloid process is a deep depression, which forms part of the jugular /ossu, and lodges the enlarged commencement or sinus of the jugular vein. 5. The inferior orifice of the carotid canal ( v,fiy. 21.), which is directed at first vertically, then horizontally, running forwards and inwards, and again vertically at its termination in the cavity of the cranium. 6. A rough surface, which gives attachment to the levator palati muscle, and the internal muscle of the malleus. Lastly, in front of the styloid process is an osseous lamina, in the form of a vertical crest («, fig. \9.), a continuation of the plate which forms both the inferior portion of the auditoi7 canal, and the posterior portion of the glenoid cavity, which it completes. This crest, which has been described by authors under the name of vaginal process, because it surrounds the styloid process without adhering to it, extends inwards to form part of the carotid canal, and outwards to the mastoid process. Between the crest and the mastoid process there is a small fissure, which may with propriety be denominated the fissure of the auricular twig, because it transmits the posterior auricular twig which comes off from the facial nerve. The other two surfaces of the petrous portion, of which one is superior and the other posterior, are in the interior of the cranium. The superior surface, which looks forwards, has a furrow running from before backwards, and from below upwards, terminating about the middle of the sur- face in a small irregular opening—the hiatus Fallopii, which communicates with the aqueduct of Fallopius. The furrow and the hiatus contain the superior or cranial filament of the vidian nerve, and a small artery. The posterior surface shows a canal directed obliquely from within outwards and forwards. This is the internal auditory meatus (I, fig. 20.); it is shorter than the external, and is tei-minated by a lamina divided into two parts by a transverse ridge; in the superior of these parts there is a single orifice, the commencement of the aqueduct of Fallopius, which receives the facial nerve; the inferior is perforated by numerous openings, through which the fibres of the auditory nerve pass ; it is the cribriform plate of the auditory nerve. Behind the internal auditory meatus is a small opening, which is the orifice of a canal named aqueductus vestihuli. These surfaces of the petrous process are separated by three borders. On the superior border (m d) we observe a furrow for the superior petrosal sinus also a projection which corresponds with the superior semicircular canal of the internal ear, and which is most prominent in the young subject; inside of this projection, a cavity, the depth of which is in the mverse ratio of the age, and is gradually obliterated in the adult, and near the summit a depres- sion on which the fifth or trifacial nerve rests. The anterior or sphenoidal border, in the external half of.its extent, is con- nected with the squamous portion of the bone ; at first by a suture which otten remains perfect even in adult life, and subsequently in a great measure disap- pears but is never completely obUterated. The internal half is free, and foms by its union with the squamous portion, a retiring angle, at the apex of whicb are the openings of Uvo canals, placed parallel, hke the barrels of a double barrelled gun, and separated by a small osseous lamina.

It is rough inferiorly for the insertion of the car- tilage of the ear; and the canal, which is more contracted in the middle than at either extremity, takes a curved direction, the concavity looking downwards and forwards : it is chiefly formed by a curved plate, named the auditonj pro- cess, which constitutes the posterior half of the glenoid cavity. The summit of the pars petrosa {v,fig.20.) is very irregular, and truncated : it presents the superior orifice of the carotid canal, and forms part of the an- terior lacerated foramen. . , „ , • „^ ^i, > Connections. The temporal articulates with five bones : — viz. three of the cranium, the parietal, occipital, and sphenoid; and two of the face, the malar and the inferior maxillary : we might add also the os hyoides, which is attached by a ligament to the styloid process. , , . ■ Internal structure. The squamous portion is compact throughout, excepting towards the circumference, where traces of diploe may be seen. Ihe petrous portion is still more compact and hard, resembling in density the teeth, or certain ivory-Uke exostoses. The mastoid portion is hollowed out into large cells, and is very Uable to be affected by caries. In the description of the organ of hearing, we shaU notice the cavities which exist m the petrous portion: the nervous and vascular canals wiU be described with the nerves and vessels which traverse them. (For the aqueduct of Fallopius, see the description of the facial nerve.) Development. The temporal bone is developed from five points of ossi- fication : the squamous, petrous, and mastoid portions, the auditory canal, and the styloid process, being each distinct. The first osseous point which appears, is situated in the squamous portion, and is visible towards the end of the second month. Immediately afterwards the petrous portion exhibits a bony nucleus, stretching from its base towards its apex. The third point in order is that of the circle of the tympanum, a kind of ring channelled aU round for the membrana tympani. This circle, at first almost horizontal, becomes gra- dually more and more oblique : it is incomplete above, and the two extremities which are applied to the squamous portion, cross each other, instead of uniting. In many auiraals the ring of the tympanum constitutes a distinct bone, named the tympanic bone. The fourth point of ossification appears in the mastoid portion during the fifth month. The last which becomes visible is that of the styloid process: it also remains distinct throughout life in the lower animals, and is called the styloid bone. It is not uncommon to find it in the same con- dition in the human subject. The development of these five pieces does not advance with equal rapidity. The petrous portion is most quickly completed. The mastoid, squamous, and petrous portions become united during the first year. The styloid process is attached to the rest of the bone at the age of two or three years; at birth the glenoid cavity is almost flat, on account of the absence of the auditory canal, and the slight development of the transverse root of the zygomatic process. The ulterior changes which take place in the temporal bone depend on the completion of the auditory canal and glenoid cavity, the increasing size of the mastoid process, and the obliteration of the projections, and filling up of the hollows on the surface of the petrous portion. It is worthy of remark, that traces of the union of the base of the petrous portion, with the squamous and mastoid portions, are visible in individuals of the most advanced age. The Cranium in general. The different bones which we have described unite in forming the cranium, an osseous cavity which incloses the brain, the cerebellum, and the annular protuberance. It is situated above the face, is the most elevated portion of the skeleton, and forms a continuation of the vertebral column. The form of the cranium is that of an ovoid, flattened below and at the sides, and with theOSTEOLOGY. 60 large extremity turned backwards. It is nevei- perfectly symmetrical; but a very great deviation has always appeared to me coincident with disease. From attentive examination of a great number of skulls of idiots and maniacs, I have observed that in these subjects there is a remarkable difference between the two sides. The dimensions of the cranium have been very accurately determined by Bichat. The antero-posterior diameter, measured from the foramen cfficum to the occipital protuberance, is about five inches* ; the transverse diameter, measured between the base of the petrous portions of the temporal bones, is four inches and a half; the vertical diameter, extending from the anterior edge of the foramen magnum to the middle of the sagittal suture, is rather less than the transverse. In front, and behin(f the spot where the height and breadth of the cranium are measured, i. e. in front and behind the bases of the petrous bones, the diameters progressively diminish. Hence it follows that the point where the cranium has the greatest capacity, is the junction of the two anterior thirds with the posterior third; that is to say, at the place of meeting, or, if I may use the expression, at the confluence of the brain, cere- bellum, and spinal marrow. The cranium, however, presents many varieties, both in regard to its di- mensions and shape. The varieties of form of the skull in different individuals appear generally to depend upon the preponderance of one diameter over another; and it may be remarked that in these cases, where one diameter is much increased, the others are almost invariably diminished in the same pro- portion, so that the absolute difference in size is by no means considerable. There are also variations in size and figure peculiar to the crania of differ- ent nations, as has been shown by the researches of Blumenbach and Soem- merring. In the white or Caucasian race the cranium is decidedly much larger than in the others, more especially than in the negro. Among certain tribes, the configui-ation of the cranium is determined by the permanent or frequently repeated compressions to which the skulls of infants are subjected. It vanes also according to age and sex, being proportionally larger in the foetus than in the adult, and in the male than in the female. It should be remarked that all these varieties are exclusively confined to the vault of the cavity. Since the cranium is exactly moulded upon the brain, great interest has been attached to the exact appreciation of its dimensions, and hence the different measm-e- ments which have been adopted for this purpose.^ The oldest is the one proposed by Camper, under the name of the facial angle. This angle is intended to measure the relative proportions of the cranium and face. It is taken by drawing one line from the middle incisors of the upper jaw, along the front of the forehead, and another from the same point to the auditory meatus The angle included between these lines is in the European trom ^0° to 85° • in the Mongolian race 75°, and in the Negro 70°. This anatomical fact had not escaped the attention of the ancients. We observe that m the statues of their heroes and gods, they have even exaggerated the facial angle, which is generally 90°, and even more in the case of Jupiter lonans. The facial angle gives no information respecting the capacity of the poste- rio^ regions of tte cranium, and consequently Daubenton had this speciaUy in v^ew in h°s mode of measurement, which bears the name of the occpital angle of Dauhenm This, however, Uke the preceding, and in fact aU hnear measure- ments IppUed to the determination of the capacity of the skull, is necessarily ments, appuett to I ^he walls of the cavity, the greater or less inexact. ^J^^^;^^™^^ projection of the alveoli, or their obliteration after loss ot tl^e teem a ^ facial and the occipital angle can been ^"ti'-^ly ^^^^'f^^,:^ direction.

External Surface of the Cranium. The external surface of the cranium offers, for consideration, a superior re°-ion or vault, an inferior, and two lateral regions. _ " The mperior region or vault is bounded by a circular line, passing trom the middle, frontal, or nasal protuberance {glabella), along the temporal fossa, to the external occipital protuberance. It is principaUy covered by the occi- pito-frontalis muscle, and presents in the median Une, 1. the trace of the union of the two primitive halves of the frontal bone: 2. the bi-panetal or sagittal suture (sagitta, an arrow), which forms a right angle in front vyith the fronto- parietal or coronal suture, and terminates behind at the superior angle of the occipito-parietal, or larnbdoidal suture (from the Greek letter lambda) : 3 be- hind this suture, a depression corresponding to the anterior superior angle ot the occipital bone. . . ■ j-rp j. On each side we observe three eminences more or less prominent in difierent individuals, and always most marked in the young. These are the frontal, the parietal, and the superior occipital protu- berances. Between the frontal and parietal protuberances, the coronal suture is situ- ated: and between the parietal and the occipital, we find the lambdoid suture. Be- sides these there are a great number of smaller projections, which Gall has also denominated protwSemnces, and to which much importance is attached in his system. The inferior region or base of the cranium {fig.2\.) is flattened and vei-y irregular. It is bounded behind, by the external occipital protuberance (a) and superior semi-circular line (a h) ; in front, by the glabella or nasal eminence: late- rally, by a line passing over the mastoid and external orbital processes. I shall content myself by describing in this place the posterior half of the base of the cra- nium ; the other half will be included in the description of the face, with the bones of which it concurs in forming the orbital, —nasal, and zygomatic fossa;. The ptery- goid processes below, and the posterior edge of the sphenoid above define the limits of these two portions.OSTEOLOGY. U2 The posterior half of the hase of the cranium presents, in the vicdian line and m an order from behind forwards, the external occipital protuberance (a), the external occipital crest (a c), the foramen magnum (rf), and condyles (e), the basilar process (re), and the transverse suture, which results from the ar- ticulation of the body of the sphenoid with the truncated inferior angle of the occipital bone —the spheno-occipital suture. On each side we observe the inferior occipital protuberances, presenting cer- tain variations in size in different subjects, to which Gall has attached great importance in his craniological system. These protuberances are bounded above by the superior semicircular line of the occipital bone (6); they are crossed in the middle by the inferior semi-circular line {g), which is separated from the preceding by muscular impressions. Between the inferior semi- cir- cular line and the occipital foramen, are also a number of inequalities for the attachment of muscular fibres. Still more anteriorly is the posterior condyloid fossa, and occasionally the posterior condyloid foramen {g). Outside the con- dyles are the jugular surface (i), the eminence of the same name, and thepetro- occipital suture, running obliquely from behind forwards and inwards (i /*), without any indentations, or even complete juxta-position of the bones, and terminating behind in a large irregular opening (before i), the posterior lace- rated foramen, which is divided into two parts by a tongue of bone : the an- terior is the smaller, and transmits the eighth pair of nerves; the posterior is larger, and is called the jugular fossa, from its receiving the enlarged com- mencement (sinus or diverticulum) of the jugular vein. The petro-occipital suture terminates in front in another irregularly triangular opening, the anterior lacerated foramen (k), which is closed by cartilage, and forms, in fact, a fonta- nelle between the edges of the occipital, temporal, and sphenoid bones. In front of the petro-occipital suture is the inferior surface of the petrous bone, with its numerous asperities ; then, still proceeding from behind forwards, we find the mastoid process (/), the digastric groove (?n), the stylo-mastoid fora- men (7), the styloid and vaginal processes, the inferior orifice of the carotid canal (u), and the petro-sphenoidal suture, at the external termination of which the osseous portion of the Eustachian tube opens by an orifice directed obliquely forwards and downwards. Thus all the sutures of the posterior half of the base of the cranium meet in the anterior lacerated foramen. From its internal angle the spheno-occipital suture stretches across to the same part of the opposite foramen. The petro- sphenoidal suture sets out from the external angle, and becomes continuous with the fissui'e of Glasserus; and the petro-occipital suture extends from the posterior angle to the occipito-mastoid suture, which it joins at an obtuse angle: all these sutures are formed by juxta-position, and not by mutual reception as those of the roof of the skull. The lateral regions of the cranium are bounded behind by the lambdoid suture ; in front by the external orbital process ; and above Iry the temporal ridge. This region more or less rounded in different subjects is, nevertheless, the flattest part of the vault of the skull. Proceeding from behind forwards, we observe, 1. themastoid region comprehending the mastoid foramen (9,^,9.21.), the external auditory meatus, the glenoid cavity, and the transverse root of the zygomatic process : 2. the temporal region or fossa, concave in front, convex behind, bounded below by the zygomatic arch, which projects considerably from the head, more especially in carnivorous animals, and by a ridge which separates it from the zygomatic fossa. The temporal fossa is traversed by nu- merous sutures, arranged in the following manner. Thefronto-parietal or coronal suture (c b,fiq. 22.) descends verticaUy ; from its inferior extremity two others proceed, one in front, the spheno-frontal, the other behind, the spheno-panetal. Each of these soon divide into two branches. From the spheno-panetal the spheno-temporal descends, and terminates in the fissure of Glasseras; the tmiporo- parietal (b i rf) passes horizontally, and becomes continuous with the lambdoidal suture (d f). The spheno-temporal and temporo-parietal sutures are, eaclj, part of the squamous suture. From the spheno-frontal suture the two followingTHE CRANIUM IN GENERAL. 63 Spheno-frontal |spheno-jugal. the Cranium. Syndesmology.) Internal Surface of the Cranium. lu order to examine the internal surface of the cranium, it is necessary to make two sections, one horizontally from the occipital protuberance to the gla- bella {fig. 23.), the other vertically _JU-|j^lji^p^ along the median line from before suture. It receives the superior longitudinal sinus in its entire extent; and contains the internal orifices of the parietal foramina. On each side are the frontal fossa, corresponding to the protuberance of the same name, and the internal surface of the fronto-parietal (coronal) sutui'e (b c, fig. 22.) ; the encephalic surface of the parietal bone {b d f c), and the parietal fossa ; the lambdoid suture (d /), and the superior occipital fossa. We may remark that the fossce are deeper than -would seem to be indicated by the external prominences, because they are partly formed at the expense of the bone itself; and that the sutures are less deeply denticulated on their internal than on their external aspect. Lastly, the whole internal surface of the vault of the cranium, but especially that of the parietal bones, is traversed by ramified grooves (6 i), partly for veins, partly for arteries; the venous grooves, which are not perceptible in all subjects, but which are very large in some, are distinguished from the arterial, as M. Breschet has pointed out, by their being perforated by numerous fora- mina. The hose of the cranium (fix/. 23.), presents three series of fossse, or three re- gions, arranged as it were in steps upon an inclined plane, from before back- wards, and from above downwards. * The malar bone is often called the jugal bone, and hence the names of fronto-iucal and upheno-jugal. " ■8 backwards (fig. 22.). In the median line, proceeding from before backwards, we observe the frontal crest or ridge, and the longitudinal groove, stretching from the frontal crest, along the roof of the skull to the internal occipital protuberance. In this groove, which is of no great depth, we find a line which indicates the place of union of the two pieces of the frontal bone during the early periods of life, and the internal surface of the sagittalOSTEOLOGY. 64 Anterior or ethmoido-frontal region. In this region we observe, in the middle, the ethmoidal fossa, in which is the foramen caecum ; the crista galli (o) ; the ethmoidal grooves, and the foramina with which they are perforated ; the eth- moidal fissure, for the ethmoidal or nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve ; the eth- moido-frontal sutures, running from before backwards ; the orifices of the internal or- bitary foramina; and the trace of the eth- mo-sphenoidal suture, running transversely. Laterally we see the orbital plates (i), remarkable for the prominence of their mamillary projections, and traversed by small grooves for the ramifications of the middle meningeal artery; and the fronto- sphenoidal sutures (before c), which mark the union of the lesser wings of the sphe- noid (c), with the orbital portion of the frontal bone (fi). The orbital plates sup- port the anterior lobes of the brain. The middle region exhibits in the centre a fossa, in which we observe the depression for the olfactory nerves, the optic groove, and olivary process (before d) ; the pituitary fossa (d), deeply excavated behind ; the quadrilateral plate (behind d); the cavernous grooves ; and the anterior and posterior clinoid processes. On the sid£s we find very deep fossee, which correspond with the midd'.e lobes of the brain, called viiddle lateral fossce of the base of the cranium ; they are broad externally, narrow internally, and are bounded in front by the posterior edge of the lesser wings of the sphenoid (e), and behind by the su- perior border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone (/)) . They are formed by the superior surface of the petrous portion, the internal surface of the squamous portion of the temporal, and the superior surface of the great wings of the sphenoid. They present, successively from before backwards, the sphenoidal fissure (or foramen lacerum superius) ; the foramen rotundum or superior maxillary (2) ; the foramen ovale (3) ; the foramen spinosum (4) ; the internal orifices of the anterior lacerated foramen, and carotid canal (before 5), and the hiatus Fallopii. We see here also the union of the sphenoid with the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bone, forming the sphcno- temporal (i and e) and petro-sphenoidal sutures. This fossa is traversed from behind, forwards and outwards by a groove (i 4), which commences at the foramen spinosum, passes along the external border of the sphenoid, or rather is hollowed out from the spheno-temporal suture, and divides into two branches: the anterior, the larger, proceeds to the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone with the anterior ramified groove in which it becomes continuous; the posterior is directed horizontally backwards to the posterior mferior angle ot the parietal bone. In some cases the portion of the groove which extends from the foramen spinosum to the summit of the lesser wing of the sphenoid, almost equals in diameter the lateral grooves, and it is then almost always pierced by foramina: it contains the middle menmgeal artery, and a large vein.

We find here theTHE CRANIUM IN GENEBvAL. 65 posterior lacerated foramen (7), the suture which unites the temporal to the occipital bone, and along the petro-occipital suture, a small groove named in- ferior petrosal (on each side of k). , , ■, , j The inferior occipital fossa is bounded above, by a broad and deep groove (n), intended to lodge the lateral sinus, and called the lateral groove. It com- mences at the internal occipital protuberance (o), and proceeds horizontally outwards to the base of the petrous portion, where it is agam enlarged and passes round, extending downwards and inwards along the occipital fossa, until it arrives at the occipito-mastoid suture (r), where it rises and terminates in the posterior lacerated foramen The inferior occipital fossa is divided into two parts by this groove : an anterior, formed by the posterior face of the pars petrosa ; and a posterior formed hy the occipital bone. In this groove, the mastoid foramen, the posterior condyloid foramen, when it exists, and the superior and inferior petrosal grooves open. The dimensions of the lateral grooves are extremely variable; most com- monly the left is smaUer and shaUower than the right, especially in its hori- zontal portion. Of the eminences and depressions on the internal sui'faoe of the cranium, the most deeply marked are those situated upon the base. This is more especially the case, with regard to the orbital plates and the middle and lateral fossaB. Since the publication of the works of Gall and Spurzheim, a,natomists have re-adopted the opinion of the ancients, who regarded these eminences and de- pressions as corresponding respectively with the anfractuosities and the con- volutions of the brain: the cranium in fact is moulded upon the brain; to be convinced of which it is only necessary to repeat the following experiment, which I have often made for this purpose. Remove the brain from the cavity of the cranium, and supply its place by plaster of Paris ; when dry, this sub- stance will present a faithful model of the convolutions and anfractuosities of the brain. In cases of chronic hydrocephalus, where the inequalities of the brain are effaced by the accumulation of fluid, the internal sui-face of the cra- nium shows scarcely any vestiges of eminences and depressions. The osseous tissue, notwithstanding its hardness, is easily moulded around organs, and yields Avith facility to the compression which soft parts exercise upon it. It is very uncommon to open the cranium of a subject, somewhat advanced in years, with- out observing in some points a more or less considerable absorption of the parietes of the skull, occasioned either by clusters of certain small white bodies, called glandulse Pacchioni, or by dilated veins. One anatomical fact worthy of notice, is the want of any configuration of the external suiface conformable in its details with that of the internal surface: compare, for instance, the roof of the orbit with the cranial surface of the or- bital plate of the frontal bone. This difference is due to the circumstance that the digital impressions encroach on the diploe, and are in part excavated from the space otherwise occupied by it. The two compact laminae which fonn the bones of the cranium, are in some measure independent of each other: the internal one belongs, so to speak, to the brain : the external to the locomotive system. The diploe is the limit of these two laminae. This anatomical fact is at variance with the doctrine of Gall respecting the protuberances : it proves that the cerebral convolutions are not faithfully represented by external pro- minences. In order to complete the anatomical history of the cranium, it yet remains to consider, 1. its general development: 2. the connection of its several parts. (For this latter subject, see Syndesmology.) As to the analogies which have been so ingeniously established between the cranium and the vertebral column, a detailed analysis of them would be out of place in an elementary work like the present. VOL. I.66 OSTEOLOGY. Development of the Cranium. Tlie cranium is remarkable for the early period at which its development commences. As soon as the embryo is sufficiently advanced in growth to ex- hibit any distinction of parts, the head, under the form of an ovoid vesicle, greatly exceeds the magnitude of the whole body. With regard to the order in which the different parts are ossified, we may remark, that the bones of the roof precede those of the base, in like manner as in the vertebras the lamina are ossified before the bodies. In both cases the evolution is most prompt m those parts which are especially destined to protect important organs. Cranial Banes at Birth. The bones of the roof of the skull appear before those of the base, but at birth ossification is less advanced in the roof than in the base ; accordingly, in a foetus at the full time the bones of the base form a solid whole, and are mimovable, while those of the roof are separated by membranous intervals, which permit of pretty extensive movements, so that at this period the roof of the cranmm yields in a great degree to pressure. At birth, there is nothing resemblmg the mode of union called suture. Nevertheless each bone presents denticula- tions like the teeth of a comb round the circumference. The existence of these indentations before the period when the bones come mto contact, proves that they are not the result of any mechanical action produced by their meeting- the only influence of this kind to which they are subjected durmg their formation, is the deviation of opposing denticulations. The frontal suture is the first developed. . • ^ t Another pecuUarity of this stage of development, is the existence of those membranous intervals denominated fontanelles. They are produced in the following manner : the process of ossification commences m the centre of the bone, and advances from that point to the circumference, the most distant parts of the bone being of course the last to be ossified. These points, m broad or fiat bones, are th! angles, and consequently at the place where several angl of different bones ultimately unite, there must exist an unossified space at h^ time • these spaces are the fontanelles. They have all been pointed out lu S de cription of the cranial bones: they are of especial importance to the accoucheur on account of the indications which they furnish for determining the posS of the child. AU traces of the fontaneUes are completely obhte- rated at the age of four years. The Wormian Bones.

According to Beclard, they are not developed until five or six months after birth: at their junction with the surrounding bones they form sutures, which are the first to become effaced in after life. , . , », , i. From all that has been said regarding this class of bones (which are m a manner accidental, for they are neither constant in number nor m their ex- istence), it is evident that they can be only considered as supplemeniary points of ossification, and not as performing an important office in contributing to the solidity of the cranium, as the name cUs de voute, given to them by some ana- . tomists, would seem to indicate. Progress of Development in the Adult and the Aged. The cartilaginous lamina which separates the bones at first, gradually be- comes ossified. The sutures become so serrated, that it is almost impossible to separate the bones, without breaking some of their teeth. At the same time that the bones increase in breadth they augment in thickness; the diploe, which at first did not exist, is developed between the two plates. In the adult several bones already begin to join by osseous union ; of this we have an example in the sphenoid and occipital, which at an early period form one bone. In the aged the traces of the sutures are in a great measure effaced, so that in certain cases the whole skull would seem to be composed of one entire piece. The continuity of some bones is occasionally such, that the venous canals of the one communicate and open directly into those of the other. It is not un- common to find the bones of an old subject thin and translucent like horn in a greater or less extent. This diminution of thickness, added to the increasing fragility of the osseous tissue, affords an explanation of the ease with which the skulls of old people may be broken: and the continuity of the bones explains the possibility of the fracture being much extended. The Face. The face is that very complicated osseous structure, which is situated at the anterior and inferior part of the head, and is hollowed out into deep cavities for the reception of the organs of sight, smell, and taste, and for the apparatus of mastication. The face is divided into two portions, the upper and the lower jaw. The lower jaw is formed by one bone only; the upper jaw consists of thirteen bones. But although this circumstance tends to establish a great difference between the two, yet it must be remarked, that all the parts of the upper jaw are so immovably united, that in appearance they form only one bone; and, more- over, that it is essentially formed by one fundamental piece, the superior max- illary bone, to which all the others are attached as accessory parts. Of the fourteen bones which constitute the face, two only are median or single: viz. the vomer and the inferior maxilla. All the others are double, and form six pairs, viz. the superior maxiUary, the malar, palate and proper nasal bones, the ossa unguis, and the inferior turbinated bones. The superior Maxillary Bones {figs. 24? and 25., with the Palate Bones). They are two in number, united to a certain extent in the median line, and form almost the whole of the upper jaw. Their figure is very irregular: they belong to the class of short bones. They have three surfaces, an external, an internal, and a superior ; and three borders, an anterior, a posterior, and an in- ferior. F 268 OSTEOLOGY. Fit;. 24. the same name. External surface {fig. 24.). Proceeding from before backwards we observe a small fossa in which the myrtiform muscle (depressor labii superioris et ala; nasi), is inserted, and which is bounded externally by the ridge which forms the al- veolus of the canine tooth : a deeper fossa, named fossa canina or irifra orbitalis, surmounted by the orifice of the infra orbitanj canal (o) : —and more posteriorly a vertical ridge, which separates the fossa canina from the maxillary tuberosity (m). This protuberance, which is most prominent before the appearance of the wisdom tooth, is traversed by small canals, the posterior and superior dental, which transmit vessels and nerves of From the anterior part of this region a long vertical process arises, the ascending or nasal process (a b) of the superior maxilla. It is of a py- ramidal shape and flattened. Its external surface is smooth, and presents the openings of certain vascular canals which communicate with the interior of the nasal fossa;, and some inequalities for the insertion of the common elevator of the upper lip and ala of the nose. On the internal surface (fig. 25.) we observe in succession from above downwards a rough surface, which assists in closing the anterior cells of the ethmoid; a horizontal ridge to which the middle turbi- nated bone is attached; a concave surface, which forms part of the middle meatus of the nose; and another horizontal ridge for articulation with the inferior tur- binated bone : like the external, this surface also is perforated by foramina, and marked by arterial furrows. Its anterior edge (a b, figs. 24, 25.) thin, and bevelled internally, is applied to the nasal bone. The posterior edge is thick and marked by the lachrymo-nasal groove, which forms part of tbe lachrymal groove above, and of the nasal duct below. It has two edges or lips : the internal, which is very thin, articulates with the os unguis and the inferior turbinated bone; the external, which is rounded, gives attachment to the straight tendon -and some fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle. The direction of the lachrymo-nasal groove is slightly curved; the convexity being internal and in front, the concavity ex- ternal and behind. The summit of the nasal process is truncated and serrated for articulation .with the nasal notch of the frontal bone. Superior or orbital surface (e,fig. 24.). This is the smallest of the three surfaces. It forms almost the entire floor of the orbit; it is triangular, and slightly oblique from within outwards, and from above downwards, and pre- sents a groove behind, which is continuous with the infra-orbitary canal. This last-named passage, at first a mere channel, afterwards a complete canal, passes from behind forwards and inwards, bends down and opens at the upper part of the canine fossa. Before its termination, it gives off a smaU canal, the anterior and superior dental, which runs in the anterior waU of the maxiUary sinus, and transmits the vessels and nerves which are distributed to the incisor and canine teeth Sometimes this branch of the canal opens into the maxillary smus. In many subjects I have seen it curve backwards, and conduct a communicating branch between the infra-orbitary and palatine nerves as far as the maxiUary tuberosity. The orbital surface is bounded by an external edge, which forms part of the spheno-maxil- lary fissure; by an internal edge, which articulates with the OS unguis, the os planum of the ethmoid, and the palate bone : and by an anterior edge, which forms part of the rim of the orbit. At the external termination of this edge is a very irregular eminence, appearnip as if part of the bone had been broken off: this is the malar process, which corresponds with the summit of the maxiUary sinus, and is articulated with the malar bone. At the internal extremity of the orbital edge, we find the ascend- ing process already described. ^ ^ ^ „ s rpy, .f^ce is divided into Intermd or naso-palatme surface (fi<J- 2.).y. 1 ws sunactSUPERIOR MAXILLARY BONES. 69 two unequal parts by a horizontal square plate, ^hich intersects it at right receivcQ, ana wuiua pic obliauelv upwards ana backwards.

That Trt of the internal surface of the maxillary bone which is situated below hrpalatine process, is of no great extent: it forms part of the arch of Se palat '1 furro^, mor^ or less delp, and bounded by P™J-i-g^f4-;;7 alonVr the external border of the palatme process, and protects the postcuor pa S vessels and nerves. The mucous membraneof the palate covers this region of the bone The part of the internal surface (n) of the superior maxillary bone which is above the palatine process, belongs to the nasal fossa: it is covered bv the pituitary membrane. We observe here from before backwards, 1. the internal surface (c) of the ascending process (a) : 2. below the inferior ridge, a smooth surface which forms part of the inferior meatus of the nose : 3. tne inferior orifice (behind c) of the lachrymo-nasal groove, sometimes converted into a complete canal by a bridge of bone: 4. the opening of the maxillary sinus (s), which appears wide in a detached bone, but m its natural con- nection is contracted by prolongations of the palate bone, the ethmoid, the inferior turbinated bone, and the os unguis, all of which are articulated with the circumference of this opening; it is still further diminished when the bones are covered by their pituitary membrane. At its lower part, this orifice pre- sents a fissure in which a lamina belonging to the palate bone is received: this method of articulation has received the name of Scliindilesis. At the upper part are small cells, which unite with the ethmoid : behind the orifice is a rough surface, which articulates with the palate bone : and, lastly, a groove, which forms part of the posterior palatine canal. The orifice which we have just described leads intj the interior of a cavity, denominated maxillary sinus, or antrum of Highmore, although it had been before very accurately described by Vesalius. It is hollowed out from the sub- stance of the maxillary bone, and has the form of a pyramid, the base of which corresponds with the internal surface of the bone; the summit with the malar process; the superior wall with the floor of the orbit; the anterior wall with the fossa canina, and the posterior with the maxillary tuberosity. These two last mentioned walls are traversed by linear projections or ridges, which correspond with the anterior and posterior dental canals. There is also one ridge upon the superior wall: it indicates the passage of the infra-orbitary canal. The extreme te- nuity of this superior or orbitary wall is an anatomical fact of great importance, because it explains the influence which tumours developed in the sinus exert upon the organs contained in the cavity of the orbit. The septum between the sinus and the bottom of the alveoli is also so thin, that an histrument can easily penetrate into the sinus in this situation. This remark applies particularly to the alveolus of the canine tooth. The anterior border {g a, figs. 24 and 25.) of the superior maxilla presents be- low a vertical portion (g d), surmounted by a small eminence called the -.lasal spine (a) : it is then hollowed out into a deep notch (a b), to form half the an- terior orifice of the nasal fossoe; and, lastly, becomes continuous with the anterior edge (b a) of the ascending process. The posterior border is vertical and very thick : it articulates below with the70 OSTEOLOGY. pterygoid process, through the medium of the palate-bone: above it forms part of the ptt'vygo-maxillary fissure. The inferior or alveolar border (y li) is the thickest and strongest part, being, in some respects, the base of the hone. It is hollowed into conical cavities se- parated by thin septa. These cavities are the alveoli or sockets of the teeth: they are proportioned in dimensions to the size of the fangs which they are intended to lodge, and in like manner are subdivided into two, three, or four secondary cavities. The bottom of these alveoli is in apposition with the maxillary sinus, into which they occasionally open. This border presents, especially in front, flutings or projections which correspond with the alveoli, and depressions which mark the inter-alveolar septa. In young subjects we may observe, chiefly behind the incisor teeth, some very remarkable foramina, to which much importance has been attached as connected with the phenomena of dentition. Internal structure. This bone is remarkably light for its size, on account of the large cavity which it incloses. It is more compact than most of the short bones, and has spongy tissue only in the alveolar border, the maxillary tuberosity, and the malar eminence. Connections. The superior maxilla is articulated with two bones of the cranium, the frontal and the ethmoid, and with all the bones of the face. It lodges eight of the teeth of the upper jaw. Development. Anatomists are not at aU agreed respecting the number and arrangement of the osseous points, which concur in forming the superior In the maxiHary bone of the foetus, and sometimes even in that of the adult, there are, as I can attest from observation, two very remarkable fissures, which would seem to indicate the primitive separation of the bone into three pieces. 1 The first fissure which may be caUed the incisive fissure, is visible on each side of the arch of the palate. It commences at the septum, which divides the alveoli of the canine tooth and lateral incisor; is contmued back- wards to the anterior palatine canal; and is prolonged above on the internal surface of the ascending process. This fissure is apparent only on the internal surface of the superior maxilla: it either does not exist at all upon the ex- ternal surface, or is so early obUterated, that it can scarcely ever be met with. The portion of the maxilla circumscribed by this fissure sustains the in- cisor teeth, and represents the incisor or inter-maxillary bone of tjie JoY'' animals lu hare-lip the solution of continuity is in the situation of this bs- sure It is therefore probable that this anterior portion of the maxillary bone is developed from a special point. Bertin asserts this, and Meckel and Beclard admit it. I have not been able to observe such independent develop- ment at any period of foetal Jife at which I have examined the maxillary ^°T'a second and equally constant fissure is visible in the situation of the infra-orbital canal, and is prolonged from the edge of the orbit in the form of a sS suture to the anterior orifice of this canal: it may be caUed the orbital toe This fissure, Uke the preceding, has always seemed to me mcomplete, nnd not occasioned by the separation of a distinct piece.

An exteriud sv^face (s h L 26.; andp b,fig. 27.) very irregular, which contributes to form the bottom of the zygomatic fossa above, and which is rough m front for union with the superior maxillary. This surface is traversed by a vertical groove which by it- self forms almost the entire extent oi the posterior palatine canal (g g,fig. 26.). 3. An anterior or maxillary border {i,fig. 27.), very thm and irregular, which advances so far forwards as to contract the entrance into the maxillary sinus, and presents a tongue of bone which is received into the fissure already de- scribed as existing at this orifice. 4. A posterior or pterygoid border {I, fig. 26.), which is appUed to the inner plate of the pterygoid process. There is below, at the angle formed by its union with the posterior edge of the horizontal por- tion, a very considerable process, for the size of the bone : this has been called palatine process, or tuberosity of the os palati (3, fig. 25.; I b, fig. 26.), but is better named pterygoid or pyramidal process: its base is continuous with the rest of the bone, and from this point it passes downwards, and is as it were inclosed in the bifurcation of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid. Its upper surface is traversed by three grooves, the middle of which forms part of the pterygoid fossa, and the lateral ones are rough and receive the summits of the two pterygoid plates. Below, the pyramidal process exhibits the orifices of the accessory ducts of the posterior palatine canal. Externally it presents a rough surface, which articulates above with the tuberosity of the superior maxilla, and which is free in the rest of its extent, and forms part of the zy- gomatic fossa. The middle of this process is grooved in a vertical direction, for the posterior palatine canal. 5. The inferior border of the vertical portionOSTEOLOGY. 72 is continuous with the external edge of the horizontal plate. 6. The superior or sphenoidal border is connected with the sphenoid in almost the whole of its extent. It presents a deep notch forming three fourths or sometimes the entire spheno-palatineforamen {6,fig. 25.; o, figs. 26,27.; n, fig. 37.), which corresponds with the spheno-palatine ganglion, and gives passage to the vessels and nerves of the same name. This border is surmounted hy two processes, an anterior or orbital (4, fig. 25. ; a, figs. 26, 27.), and a. posterior or sphenoidal {5, fig. 25. ; in, figs, 26, 27.). The sphenoidal process is the broader, particularly at its base, but is not so elevated as the anterior: it presents three facettes, an internal, which forms part of the nasal fossa; an external, which is visible in the zygomatic fossa; and a superior, which articulates with the sphenoid, and presents a groove which contributes to form the pterygo-palatine canal. The orbital process, inclined outwards, and supported by a constricted portion or neck, has five facettes. Three of these are articular, viz. the internal (lu, fig. 27.), which is concave, and unites with the ethmoid, covering and com- pleting its cells ; the anterior (p,fig. 27.), which joins the maxillary bone ; and the posterior (_q,fig. 26.), which is united to the sphenoid by certain asperities surrounding a cell, which exists in the substance of the process and communi- cates with the sphenoidal sinus. The other two are non-articular, viz. the su- perior (r,fig. 26.), which forms the deepest part of the floor of the orbit, and the external {s,fig. 26.), which forms part of the zygomatic fossa, and is sepa- rated from the preceding by a small edge, which constitutes a portion of the spheno-maxUlary fissure. Internal structure. The palate bone is compact throughout, excepting in the palatine process, where it is thick and cellular. Connections. The palate bone articulates with its fellow on the opposite side, with the maxillary, the sphenoid, the ethmoid, the inferior turbinated bone, and the vomer. Development. This bone is developed from a single point of ossification, which appears from the fortieth to the fiftieth day, at the point of union of the vertical and horizontal portions, and the pyramidal process. During its de- velopment the bone appears as it were crushed down, so that the vertical portion is shorter than the horizontal, and there is a marked predominance in the antero-posterior diameter. This disposition is in accordance with the shortness of the vertical diameter of the superior maxilla. The Malar Bones (Jig. 28.). The malar bones, called also cheek, jugal, or zygomatic bones, are situated in the superior and lateral part of the face: their form is that of a very irregular four-sided figure. They have #<# Pig- 2«. three surfaces, an anterior, a posterior, and a superior; four borders, and four angles. The anterior or cutaneous surface (a) looks outwards, is convex and smooth, and presents the openings of several foramina (/t), named malar, which are intended for nerves and vessels. This surface gives attachment below to the zygomaticus major muscle. It forms the most pro- minent part of the cheek, and is covered only by the skin and orbicularis pal- pebrarum muscle: it is consequently much exposed to injury. The superior or orbital surface (6) is supported by a thick curved process, the orbital process, which arises from the bone almost at a right angle. This surface is concave, and of small extent: it forms part of the orbit, exhibits the internal openings of one or more malar foramina, and terminates behind by a rough, serrated edge, which articulates above with the frontal and sphe- noid boni, and below with the superior maxiUary The same maxillary edge presents in the middle a retiring, smooth angle, which constitutes the anterior extremity of the spheno-maxillary fissure.NASAL BONES. 73 The posterior or temporal surface is concave, and presents a smooth surface behind, which contributes to form the temporal fossa, and on which one or more malar foramina open; and a rough surface in front, which unites with the malar process of the superior maxilla. Of the four borders two are superior ; of these the anterior or orbital (d e), is semi-lunar, rounded, and blunt, and forms the external third of the base of the orbit: the posterior or temporal (e /), is thin and curved like the letter S. and bounds the temporal fossa in front. Of the two inferior borders, the an- terior or maxillary (d g), is very rough,and articulates with the maxillary bone : the posterior or masseteric (gf) is horizontal, thick, and tubercular, and gives attachment to the masseter muscle. Of the four angles, the superior or frontal (e), which is much elongated, and vertical, is the thickest part of the bone, and articulates with the external or- bital process of the frontal bone : the posterior or zygoviatic (/), broader and thinner than the preceding is serrated, and slants downwards and backwards for articulation with the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, which rests upon it. The internal or orbital angle ((/), looks inwards and forwards, is very acute and articulates with the superior maxillaiy, near the infra-orbitary canal. The inferior or malar angle {g) looks downwards, is obtuse, and xmites with the outer part of the malar or jugal process of the superior maxillary. Internal structure. The malar bone is almost entirely compact, possessing spongy tissue only in the anterior and inferior edge, and in the part where the orbital portion is given off. It is constantly traversed by a canal, called zygomatic. This passage is generally simple, but sometimes double or even multiple, and opens by at least three orifices. The superior or orbital orifice is visible on the surface of the same name; the next or external zygomatic fo- ramen is on the cutaneous surface of the bone ; and the third or internal zy- gomatic on the inner surface of the vertical portion. Connections. The malar bone is articulated with the superior maxillary, the frontal, the sphenoid, and the temporal. Development. It is developed from one point of ossification which appears about the fiftieth day of foetal life. The ulterior changes which it undergoes do not require particular notice. The Nasal Bones {Jigs. 29, 30.). The nasal bones are two in number, asymmetrical, and very small in the Fin. 2n. Fig 30. l"i™an subject; they are closely contiguous to each other, n <t sometimes united into one piece superiorly. They are situated ^ at the upper and middle part of the face, and form, as their name indicates, the osseous part of the nose, of which they constitute the root. They are directed obliquely downwards and foi-wai-ds, but with various degrees of inclination in dif- ferent subjects; and hence the vai-ieties in the shape and ^ prominence of the middle or bridge of the nose. Their <^ figure is rectangular and oblong; they are thick and narrow above, broad and thin below; and have two surfaces, an anterior and a pos- terior, and four edges. The anterior or cutaneous surface {fig. 29.) is covered only by the skin and pyramidalis nasi muscle, and hence the ease with which these bones are fractured ; it is concave above, flat or even convex below: the orifice of a vas- cular canal is always very distinctly seen, which is variable in its situation sometimes single, but often accompanied by others of smaller size. The posterior or pituitary surface {fig. 30.) is concave, and forms the anterior part of the roof of the nostrils : it is marked by vascular and nervous furrows and m the fresh state is covered by the pituitary membrane. Of the four edges, the superior {a, figs. 29, 30.), short, thick, and serrated, ar- ticulates with the nasal notch of the frontal bone. The inferior {d) verv thin and more elongated, has a slight notch in the centre for the passagi of a74 OSTEOLOGY. nervous filament, and forms part of the anterior orifice of the nasal fossa;; it unites with the lateral cartilage of the nose. The internal (J)) edge is thick above and hevilled, so that, when approximated to the other bone, the two constitute a furrow, in which the nasal spine of the frontal and the perpen- dicular lamella of the ethmoid bone are received. The external (c) edge is somewhat longer than the internal, is slightly bevilled on the outer table, and indented for articulation with the ascending process of the superior maxilla, ■which rests upon it. Connections. The two bones are articulated together; they unite also with the frontal, the ethmoid, and the superior maxilla, and likewise with the lateral cartilages of the nose; they afford passage to the vessels which establish a communication between the skin of the nose, and the mucous membrane of the nasal fossaj. Internal structure. The nasal bones are thick and cellular m their upper parts, thin and entirely compact in their lower, and are traversed by nervous and vascular grooves. . Development. The nasal bone is developed ft-om one single osseous point, which appears before the end of the second month. Ossa Unguis, or Lachrymal Bones {figs. 31, 32.). These are the smallest bones of the face ; they are thin like paper, and have Fig.ZX. Fig.32. the transparence, tenuity, and even the shape of a nail, from which circumstance one of their names has been de- rived. They are situated at the internal and anterior part ¥7 of-the orbit; their figure is irregularly quadrilateral; they 0¥ are two in number, and therefore asymmetrical. They have two surfaces and four edges. ^ The external or orbital surface (fg. 32.) is divided into n two unequal parts by a vertical ridge (a b), which terminates below in a sort of hook. The portion anterior to the ridge is narrow, and marked by a porous groove (c), which when joined to the channel on the as- cending process of the superior maxilla forms the lachrymal groove (hence the name of lachrymal bone).* The portion (d) of the os unguis, which is posterior to the ridge, completes the inner wall of the orbit. , , .s i.- The internal or ethmoidal surface (Jig. 31.) presents a ^^oy, (a' b) which corresponds to the external ridge; the portion (c') m front of the furrow forms part of the middle meatus; behind is a rough surface (d')^h^eh covers the an- tprior cells of the ethmoid. ... .^-l. ^t. Of the four borders, the superior (aa') is rough, and articulates with the internal orbital process of the frontal bone ; the inferior (b b ) articulates with he inferior turbinated bone, by a small tongue which passes backwards and which contributes to form the nasal canal, and with the interna edge of the S.Hal surface of the superior maxillary. The anterior edge (e e;) unites with theScending process of the maxillary bone; and the posterior edge (Jf), sUghtirdenticXted, joins the orbital portion or lamma papyracea of the eth- ^"Cmnections.

Tlie inferior Turbinated or inferior Spongy Bones (flffs.SS,3A: and dijig- 37.). The inferior turbinated bones, so called on account of their curved figure are 1 he interior turoinaie ^.^^^^^^ ^^^^^ external waU ot the nasal fossaj {d,fig. 35.), below the ethmoid, whence the name sub-ethmoidal turbinated bones. They are two in number, asymmetrical, and their greatest diameter is directed from before backwards. They have two surfaces, two edges, and two extremities. , . -3 o-, n ■ The internal surface {fig. 34. and d, fig. 37.) is convex, and looks towards the septum of the nose, which it sometimes touches when that part deviates from the straight direcfton ; the external surface (fig. 33.) is concave, and forms part of the middle meatus. Both are rough and as it were spongy, which has given rise to the assertion that these bones form an exception to the general rule of the spongy tissue being in the interior of bones : this appearance, however, is owing to the multiphcity of canals intended for nerves, and more particularly for veins which expand over the bone. The superior or articular edge {a be d,figs. 33, 34.) is very irregular, and presents from before backwards —1. a thin edge (a 6) which articulates with the ascending process of the superior maxilla : 2. a small emi- nence bearing the name of nasal or lachrymal process (6), which articulates by its apex with the os unguis, and by its two edges with the two lips of the as- cending process of the superior maxillary to complete the nasal canal: 3. a curved plate, caDed auricular process (e, fig. 33.) by Bertin, who compared it to the ear of a dog; this plate is directed downwards, and applied .partially upon the orifice of the maxillary sinus, which it assists in closing: 4. behind this process we find a thin edge (e d,figs. 33, 34.), which articulates with a small ridge on the palate bone : 5. between the auricular and the lachrymal pro- cesses, are small prominences which unite with the ethmoid. The inferior ov free border (a «f) is convex, and thicker in the middle than as its extremities; it is separated from the floor of the nostrils by an interval (ni o,fig. 37.) of uncertain extent, a circumstance to be remembered during the introduction of instruments into the nasal fossae. The anterior extremity (a) is a little less pointed than the posterior (d), which distinguishes the bone of the right from that of the left side. Connections. The inferior turbinated bones articulate with the superior maxiUary, the palate bones, the ethmoid, and the ossa unguis: they have im- portant relations with the inferior orifice of the nasal canal, which they defend from the contact of foreign bodies. Structure. Their external spongy appearance depends upon the multitude of canals with which their surface is furrowed, bat they are almost exclusively formed of compact tissue. Development. Their ossification commences about the fifth month of foetal life, by a point situated in the centre. The Vomer (Jig. 35. and \0,fig. 22.). The vomer is so called from its supposed resemblance to a ploughshare. It is situated in the median plane, and forms the pos- terior part of the septum of the nostrils. It is thin, flat, and quadrilateral, and has two surfaces and four edges. The surfaces are placed laterally (as at o, fig. 35.), and are generally plane, but they are often bent to one side or the other, and are then convex concave in opposite directions —; they are always smooth and covered by76 OSTEOLOGY. the pituitary membrane, and present small vascular and nervous furrows. The superior or sphenoidal border (/;, fig. 35. and 3, fig. 22.) is the shortest and thickest: It IS marked by a deep groove which receives the inferior crest of the sphenoid; the two lips of the groove are bent outwards, and received into furrows on the inferior surface of the same bone, and thus complete a small channel for the passage of vessels and nervous filaments. The inferior or maxillary (c) border is the longest, and is received into the furrow which is formed by the union of the two palate bones, behind, and of the two superior maxillary in front: it some- times terminates by a more or less prominent process behind the anterior nasal spine. The anterior or ethmoidal border (d, fig. 35. and 3 4, fig. 22.) presents the continuation of the groove on the superior edge, and receives the inferior border of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid. There is no groove, where it is attached to the cartilaginous septum. The posterior or guttural edge {e,fig. 35. and t, 10, fig. 22.) is free: it is thin and sharp, and inclines downwards and forwards : it separates the posterior openings of the nasal fossaj. Connections. The vomer is articulated with the sphenoid, the ethmoid, the superior maxillary, the palate bones, and the cartilage of the septum. Internal structure. The vomer is composed of two very thin compact lamina; which are distinct above but united below. Some anatomists have called these plates, alcB of the vomer. _ Development. It is developed from one point of ossification, which is situated at the lower part of the bone, and appears before the end of the se- cond month. It then presents the form of a deep groove, embracing the car- tilage just as at a future period it embraces the sphenoidal crest. At birth the vomer is still only a groove; afterwards this condition is confined to the sphenoidal and ethmoidal edges of the bone. It is not uninteresting to note the peculiar and uncommon manner in which the ossification proceeds from the surface to the interior of the cartilage. fig. 36. Inferior Maxilla (Jig. 36.). While, as we have before observed, a considerable number of bones enter into the formation of the upper jaw, the lower jaw consists of one bone only. The inferior maxilla occupies the lower part of the face. It has the shape of a parabolic curve, the two ex- tremities of which, called rami, form a right angle with the middle portion or body. Of the body or middle portion (a). The body represents a curved plate, convex in front and concave behind. It offers to our notice an anterior and a posterior surface, and a supe- rior and inferior border. The anterior surface has in the middle a verticalline, QvAXed, symphysis menli (c d) : it marks the place of union of the two pieces of which this bone is composed in young subjects, and which in a crrpat number of animals remain distinct through lite. ^Tiem^de in which the two halves of the body of the inferior r^^ff^l united forming an arch, instead of an angle as in other animals, constitutes one ch^ers^i^th.h„ fact:^d?S:iroXri^^^^^^^^^ th^lower animals, is a no less cha- r'^en^tic mark of man, called mental pr^^%^t^S:^l^ smalf tubercles, two superior and Kio inint - mil .IS a Similar arrangement obtains be- Je^\lXr>.re?oF'^hTu?pTr1aT.*e^^ arc enabled to swallow an object much larger than their head, or even than their body.INFERIOR MAXILLA. 77 tAvo inferior, Icnown by the collective appeUation of genial processes Cj^^uho. the chin), and give attachment to the genio hyoid and genio-glossal muscles. On eachfide of the sympbjsis, .ve observe on the anierwr or cutaneous surface of the body of the inferior maxilla, I. a small depression, for the attachmen of muscles, named mento?>sa(e e) : 2. a Ime, which commences a the mental process, passes obliquely up^vards, and becomes contmnous with the anterior edge of the ramus of the jaw ; it is named the e:,ternal oblique or external max^ illary line ( ef\ and is also intended for muscular insertions : 3, above this line, the mental forLm (g), the orifice of the inferior dental canal -^hich transmits the mental vessels and nerves: 4. the anterior surface of the alveolar arch (c A), marked by a series of projections corresponding to the alveob, and separated by vertical depressions which point out the situation of the inter-alveolar septa: 5. below the external obUque line, a smooth surface (a) separated from the skm by the platysma myoides muscle. The posterior or lingual surface is in some measure moulded upon the tongue : it presents, 1. the mylo-hyoidean line (/;) {ixixos, dens molaris-), called also internal oblique or internal maxillary, which commences at the genial processes, and passes upwards and backwards, becoming more prominent opposite the last molar tooth : 2. below this line, a broad but superficial depression, which lodges the sub-maxillary gland: 3. above the oblique line, and near the symphysis, & fossa which lodges the sub-lingual gland, and a smooth surface covered by the mucous membrane of the mouth and gums. These two lines, the external and mternal oblique, divide the bodyof the in- ferior maxilla into two parts, a superior ov alveolar, and an inferior or basilar. The first named constitutes almost the entire body of the bone in the foetus and the infant; in the adult it forms only two thirds of the depth of the bone, the other third being the basilar portion : lastly, in the aged, the alveolar portion almost entirely disappears, and the basilar only is left. The superior or alveolar border describes a smaller curve than the corre- sponding alveolar edge of the superior maxilla; so that, in a regular conforma- tion of the parts, the inferior incisor teeth are overlapped by the superior. This border is less thick in front than behind, where it projects inwards ; it is pierced by a series of sockets or alveoli, resembling those of the superior maxiUa, and like them variable according to the kind of teeth which they are intended to receive. The inferior border or base of the jaw (d ni) is the thickest part of the bone ; it forms part of a larger curve than the superior border, so that the jaw projects forwards in some measure at the lower part: this projection varies much in different subjects. Bami of the inferior maxilla {b b). These are quadrilateral, and present, 1. an external surface (&) covered by the masseter muscle, which is inserted into it, especially below, where we may observe depressions and ridges, and where the bone itself is more or less bent outwards ; in front of these ridges is a slight mark which corresponds with the situation of the facial artery : 2. an internal or pterygoid surface, also rough, for the attachment of the internal pterygoid muscle, and on which is observed the superior orifice (Z) of the infe- rior dental canal, which is wide, and has a sort of spine, to which the internal lateral ligament of the temporo-maxillary articulation is attached; a small ^oove passes from this orifice in the same direction as the canal, and bears the name of mylo-hyoidean furrow, because it lodges the nerve of that name: 3. a posterior or parotid edge, which is round, and gives attachment below to the stylo-maxillary ligament: it is embraced by the parotid gland : 4. an anterior edge (»■), marked by a groove, which is the continuation of the alveolar border ; the anterior and posterior lips of this groove being formed by the external and internal oblique lines : 5. a superior edge very thin, and hollowed out into a deej) notch, called sigmoid notch (n o), on account of its shape, giving passage to nerves and vessels: 6. an iiferior edge, which is nothing more than a continu- ation of the inferior border of the body of the bone.78 OSTEOLOGY. The angle ■which the rami form -with the body of the bone, is named the angle of the jaw (m). It is a right angle in the adult, but very obtuse in the infant, as also in the carnivora and some of therodentia, this disposition enabling its muscles to act with gi-eater power. The rami of the inferior maxilla are terminated above by two processes ; the anterior, called the coronoid process (n) ; the posterior named the condyle (p). The coronoid process is triangular, and inclined forwards ; broad at its base, and pointed at its simimit; it gives attachment to the temporal muscle. The size of this process in the different species of animals bears an exact and con- stant proportion, both to the depth and extent of the temporal fossa, and to the strength and curvature of the zygomatic arch. The condyle articulates with the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone; it is an oblong eminence, the greatest diameter of which is directed slightly inwards and backwards. It is supported by a contracted portion, called the neck of the condyle {cervix) (o). This neck is turned inwards, in such a manner, that 'the condyle which it supports, does not project beyond the external plane of the ramus of the jaw ; it is also pretty deeply excavated internally to afford attach- ment to the external pterygoid muscle. The neck of the condyle is the weakest part of the inferior maxilla. Connections. The inferior maxilla articulates with the temporal bone, and lodges the lower range of teeth. Structure. The external surface of the inferior maxilla is composed of com- pact tissue ; the interior of the bone assumes the form of diploe, and is tra- versed for a great part of its extent by the denial or inferior maxillary canal, which transmits the vessels and nerves that are distributed upon the teeth of this jaw. This canal commences at the middle of the ramus, by a groove covered with a fibrous lamina, the only use of which, as it appears to me, is to protect the vessels and nerves, and to separate them from the internal pterygoid muscle. From this point it proceeds forwards and inwards below the mylo-hyoidean hne, the curvature of which it foUows; it gradually becomes contracted m diameter; and in the situation of the second small molar or bicuspid tooth, it divides into two canals, the larger of which is very short, and opens upon the external sur- face of the body of the bone at the mental foramen already described ; the other, very minute, pursues the original tract, and is lost near the middle mcisor tooth. In its passage the inferior dental canal communicates with the alveoli, by one, and sometimes two foramina, through which the vessels and nerves of the teeth are transmitted. The situation of the dental canal vanes much in different periods of Ufe. In the new-born infant, before the appearance of the teeth, it occupies the lowest portion of the jaw ; after the second dentition, it cor- responds prettynearly with the mylo-hyoidean hne : and after loss of the teeth, it runs along the alveolar border. In the inferior maxilla of the old subject, the anterior orifice of the dental canal, or the mental foramen, is close to the superior border of the bone. The dimensions of the dental canal are no less remarkable for their variations ; it is very large m the foetus, and in the child before the appearance of the second set of teeth; it dmumshes durmg adult aee, and is much contracted in the old subject. ■ ^ e ^=c;fio. Development. The inferior maxilla is developed by two points of ossifica- tion one for each lateral half. Antenrieth admits in addition three comple- tion, one J;^^" , condvle, one for the coronoid process, and one fTtKgT 4ri hte n^^^^^^^^^ them.

(Spix affirms that it remains separate uiitU the fourth month). The two halves of the maxilla are joined together during he first year after birth. The traces of this union exist for some time bu are afterwards effaced; in the lower animals the suture remains throughout life The changes which the inferior maxilla undergoes after birth, relate, 1. to the angle which the ramus forms with the body of the bone, which is very obtuse at birth, and becomes a right angle after development is completed: 2 to the alterations effected in the body of the bone, by the first and second dentitions, the loss of teeth in the aged, and the subsequent absorption and disappearance of the alveoli. The Face in general. Having already noticed the situation of the face, we shall now proceed to examine its dimensions, figure, and regions. Dimensions of the Face. In order to form a just idea of the dimensions of the face, it is necessary to examine a skull cut vertically from before backwards (asin^^. 22.). We then perceive that the face is comprised within a triangular space, which is bounded above by an irregular line that separates it from the cranium; in front by the face, properly so called; and below by a line passing below the symphysis menti. If a Une be drawn above the inferior maxilla, and under the arch of the palate, when prolonged backwards, it will be in the plane of the foramen magnum; for the cranium having much less depth in fj'ont than behind, a horizontal line, which touches the cranium behind, is separated from it in front by the entire height of the upper jaw. The vertical diameter, which extends from the frontal protuberance to the chin, is the longest of all the diameters of the face. It gradually diminishes from before backwards. The transverse diameter is of considerable extent in the situation of the cheeks, but diminishes above and below this point. The antero-posterior diameter stretches above from the nasal spine to the basilar pro- cess ; below it is greatly contracted ; and at the level of the chin only measures the thickness of the symphysis. With regard to the dimensions of the face as a whole, we shall only refer to what has been already stated concerning the inverse proportion of the area of the cranium, and that of the face in different species of animals.* The face represents a triangular pyramid, and offers for consideration three surfaces or regions ; an anterior, a superior, and an inferior. • Vide of the cranium in gRnoral; of the facial angle of Camper; the occipital angle of Dau- benton, and the measurement of Cuvier, p. fiO.80 OSTEOLOGY. Anterior or Facial Region. The numerous anatomical differences which this region presents, form dis- tinctive characters, not only of ditferent nations, but also of different indivi- duals. It is bounded above by the forehead, below by the base of the inferior maxilla, and laterally by a line which passes along the external orbital process, the malar bone, and the ridge -which separates the canine fossa from the tuberosity of the maxilla. In this region we observe, in the median line, the nasal eminence, a transverse suture formed by the union of the proper nasal bones with the OS frontis, the fronto-nasal suture; below this suture the nose, a pyramidal eminence, narrow above or at its root, broad below or at its base, and formed by two bones which are united together by juxta-position in the median line, and to the ascending process of the superior maxilla externally. Below this eminence, is the anterior orifice of the nasal fosses, which has the form of a heart on playing cards, andpresents at the bottom the anterior nasal spine, and below this a vertical suture, the maxillary, the interval which separates the middle in- cisor teeth, the opening of the mouth, and the symphysis menti. On each side, ■we find the opening or base of the orbit, directed obliquely outwards, of an ir- regular square form, and presenting above, the supra-orbitary foramen; below, the infra-orbitary foramen; on the outside, the fronto-jugal suture ; and on the inside, the fronto-maxillary suture. Below the opening of the orbit is the canine fossa, then the alveoli and teeth of the two jaws, the external oblique line, the mental foramen, and the base of the inferior maxilla. Superior or Cranial Region. This region is so united with the inferior surface of the cranium, that the skull and the superior maxilla form only one piece, and cannot be removed from each other. It presents in the median line counting from behind forwards, the articulation of the vomer with the sphenoid, in which articulation there is a mutual reception of parts, the sphenoidal crest being received between the la- mina of the vomer, and these in their turn being lodged m correspondmg fissures in the sphenoid; the articulation of the vomer with the posterior edge of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid; the articulation of this perpendicular plate with the nasal spine of the frontal bone; and the articulation of this spine with the proper bones of the nose. On each side, proceeding from withm out- wards we observe, 1. the roof of the nasal fossae, formed behind by the in- ferior surface of the body of the sphenoid; in the middle by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid ; and in front by the posterior surface of the nasal bones: 2. more externally the base of the pterygoid processes, the articulation of the palate bone with the sphenoid, the pterygo-palatine canal, and the spheno-palatme fora- men- 3 the articulation of the lateral masses of the ethmoid with the sphenoid behind and with the frontal bone in front: 4. the articulation of the internal or- bital process of the frontal bone with the os unguis: 5. the articulation of the nasal notch of the frontal bone with the ascending process of the superior max- illa and the proper bones of the nose : 6. more extemaUy still the roof of the orbit bounded externally by the articulation of the frontal with the malar bone and the sphenoid, and by the sphenoidal fissure : 7. the anterior surface of the reat wing of the sphenoid, which forms the largest portion of the external waU of the orbit: 8. outside the orbit, the zygomatic arch. Inferior or Guttural Region. This renion forms part of the pharynx and cavity of the mouth. It presents from Sd forwards: 1. a vertical portion: 2. a horizontal portion: and 3, another vertical portion.FACE IN GENERAL. 81 The vertical portion (fig. 21.) exhibits in the median line the posterior edge of the septum narium, formed by the vomer; the posterior extremity of the articulation of the -vomer with the sphenoid (o,fig. 21.); and the posterior nasal spine. On each side, the posterior opening of the nasal fossa (k o, y) -which is quadrilateral, longer in its vertical than in its transverse diameter, and formed internally by the vomer, externally by the pterygoid process (r), above by the sphenoid united -with the palate bone, and belo-w by the palate bone. More ex- ternally is the pterygoid fossa (r), formed by the sphenoid, and a small part of the palate bone. Still more externally, we find a deep fossa, or rather a large space bounded internally by the external plate of the pterygoid process and the tuberosity of the maxUlary bone, and externally by the ramus of the inferior maxilla: it is kno-vm by the name of the zygomatic fossa. The horizontal portion is the arch of the palate (i x y,fig. 21.). It is of a parabolic form, extremely rough, and in the fresh state covered by the palatine mucous membrane. It is constituted by the palatine processes of the maxillary bones (x), and by the horizontal portions of the palate bones (y), and presents in consequence a crucial suture, at the central point of which the vomer is at- tached : hence the piece of anatomical nicety which consisted in asking at what part of the skeleton it is possible to touch five bones at once with the point of a needle. The arch of the palate is pierced by several foramina; we find here the Loferior opening of the anterior palatine canal (1), which is single below, but double above, so as to open into each nostril separately; the posterior pala- tine canals (2), which open at the posterior and external part of the arch of the palate; and a groove which runs along the external edge of the arch, and lodges the posterior palatine vessels and nerves at their exit from their canals. The third portion is also vertical; it presents 1. in the tnedian line, the suture of the two superior maxillary bones, the interval between the middle in- cisor teeth of each jaw, the symphysis menti, and the genial processes : 2, on each side, the posterior surface of the alveolar border of the upper jaw, and the two rows of teeth which lie across each other like the blades of scissors in the middle, but meet posteriorly: 3. the posterior surface of the inferior maxilla, the internal oblique line, the sublingual and sub-maxillary fossae, and lastly the base of the inferior maxilla. Zygomatic or Lateral Regions. These regions are bounded above and on the outside by the Zygomatic arch; above and on the inside by the transverse ridge which separates the temporal from the zygomatic fossa.. They present first a plane surface formed by the ramus of the mferior maxiUa ; when this part is removed, we observe the zyao- matic fossa, the superior waU of which is formed by the inferior surface of the great wing of the sphenoid, the anterior by the maxiUary tuberosity, the in- ternal, by the outer plate of the pterygoid process, and the external by the ramus of the mfenor maxiUa. The posterior and inferior walls are wanting. At the bottom of this fossa, between the maxillary bone and the anterior surface ot the pterygoid process, is a large vertical fissure, named by Bichat the pteruqo- maxillary fissure; this opening leads into a sort of fossa, denominated by the Older anatomists bottom of the zygomatic fossa, aad by Bichat spheno-maxillary jossa, which. It IS important to study carefully, because five foramina or canals open into it, viz. three behind; the foramen rotundum, the vidian or pterygoid, and th^pterygo-palatine canals. A fourth on the inside, the spheno-palJine, and a ntth below the superior orifice of the posterior palatine canal itc „ * spheno-maxillary fossa presents, at the union of its superior with oL^llT'" T ' ■^pJ'eno-maxillary fissure (fig. 21, before 3), which on the SenS rn?n.%T ""'.f ^ angle with the sphenoidal fissure (_ov foramen lacerum -n ^ "Sht angle with the pterygo-maxiUary fissure.

Cavities of the Face. The study of those bones which we have been engaged in examining, has made us acquainted with the existence of a great number of cavities, which considerably augment the size of the face, and multiply its internal surfaces, without proportionally increasing the weight. ... . , . All the cavities of the face may be reduced to three principal; viz. 1. the orbital cavities: 2. the nasal fossa;, of which aU the sinuses are depend- encies : and 3. the buccal cavity or mouth. The Orbits. These cavities, two in number, have the form of quadrangular pyramids, the axes of which prolonged backwards, would intersect each other m the situation of the seUa turcica. It should, at the same time, be remarked, that the internal wall of the orbit does not participate in this obliquity, but is directed straight from before backwards. We have to consider in each orbit, a superior, an inferior, an external, and an internal waU ; four angles which correspond to the intersec'tionof these surfaces; a base and an apex. ■ e , „„a The superior wall, or roof of the orbit, formed by the frontal bone in front, and by the orbital or lesser wing of the sphenoid behind, is concave, and presents from before backwards, 1. towards the outside, the lachrymal fossa : 2. on the nside the sUght depression in which the pulley for the superior obhque muscle is attached 3. the suture between the lesser wing of the sphenoid and the or- bital Plate of the frontal bone : 4. the foramen opticum.

At the apex ot the orbit is the union of the sphenoidal, the spheno-maxiUary, and pterygo-maxillary fissures. The Nasal Fossa. These foss« are two in number, separated from each other by a vertical septum directed from before backwards ; they are situated m the middle^ of the face, and are prolonged into the interior of several of the bones of the face and cra- nium by means of the cavities caUed sinuses. To describe theu-situation more exactly, we may say, that they are placed below the anterior andnoiddle part o. the base of the cranium, above the cavity of the mouth, between the orbits, and the canine and zygomatic fossa of each side. In order to have an exact idea, either of the dimensions or the shape of the nasal fossa!, it is necessary to have recoui-se to horizontal and vertical sections: of which the latter should be made both from before backwards and from side to side. With regard to their dimensions the nasal fossae (see figs. 22. and 37.) pre- sent 1 a vertical diameter, larger in the middle than before or behind : 2. a transverse diameter much shorter than the other two, and graduaUy con- tracted* from the lower to the upper part, on account of the obhquity of the external wall: 3. an antero-posterior diameter, which measures the whole of the interval between the anterior and posterior openings of the nares. The nasal fossffi have a horizontal direction, but are nevertheless slightly inclined backwards and downwards ; this is caused by the sloping of the in- ferior wall and the obliquity of the body of the sphenoid, which forms part of the superior wall. They are irregular cavities, and have four walls, — a superior, an inferior, an internal, and an external, and two orifices, an anterior and a posterior. The superior wall or roof of the nasal fossa presents a concavity looking down- wards ; it is formed, 1. in front by the proper bones of the nose, and in a small degree by the nasal spine of the frontal bone; 2. in the middle, by the cribri- form plate of the ethmoid: 3. behind, by the body of the sphenoid. In this wall are two transverse sutures, namely: before, the suture which indicates the union of the nasal and frontal bones, and behind, that which marks the union of the ethmoid and sphenoid. At the back part of this wall the opening of the sphenoidal sinus is seen. The inferior wall or floor, much broader but shorter than the superior, pre- sents a transverse concavity, it is directed from before backwards, and slightly from above downwards, which arrangement concurs in determining the obli- quity of the nasal fossse. It is formed, in front by the superior maxilla, behind, by the palate bone; a transverse suture marks the union of these bones. Near its anterior extremity, and at the side of the median line, the floor of the nasal fossae shows the superior orifice of each branch of the anterior palatine canal (^r, fig. 22. and o, fig. 37.). The internal wall (see fig. 22.) formed by the septum, is generally flat, but sometimes concave or convex, according as it is bent to one or the other side.f We find here the suture which indicates the union of the vomer with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid (S4,fig. 22.) ; the septum in the skeleton is deeply notched in front, and this notch (1 4 8) which is formed above by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, and below by the vomer, is occupied in the fresh state by a cartilage, called the cartilage of the septum. ' This progressive contraction of tlie nasal fosste from below upwards, and the obliquity o( the extern.il wall, ought to be remembered during the introduction of instruments into the nose.' t Sometimes the deviation of the septum is so considerable that the internal touches the ex- ternal wall, and consequently there is great difficulty in the passage of the air. This circum- stance has given rise in some cases to a suspicion of the existence of polypus. G 2»4 OSTEOLOGY. The external wall (Jiy. 37.), remarkable for its anfractuosities, is formed by the ethmoid (Jb c), the os unguis, the palate bone (in y). the superior maxillary (s u o), and the inferior turbi- nated bone (d). It presents from above downwards, 1. the superior turbinated bone, superior concha, or crnicha of Morgagni (Ji), in front of which is a rough square surface; 2. the superior meatus (between b and c), at the back part of which we find the spheno-pala- tine foramen (n), and the opening of the posterior ethmoidal cells ; 3. below the superior meatus, the middle turbinated bone, or middle concha (c) ; 4. below, the middle meatus (between c and d), at the back of which is the opening of the maxillary sinus already described {see maxillary bone, ^ig'. 25.): and in front, the infundibulum (s, Jig. 37.) which leads into the anterior ethmoidal cells; 5. the in- ferior turbinated bone, or inferior concha (d); G. the inferior meatus (in o), in which we find the inferior orifice of the nasal canal. The anterior and posterior openings of the nasal fossae have been described with the anterior and inferior regions of the face. General Development of the Face. The development of the face is not effected solely by an equable increase of its dimensions; for certain regions are at one period of life predominant, at another period relatively smaller, which circumstances give rise to very cha- racteristic differences of form at different ages. State of the Anterior Region of the Face at different Periods of Life. In thefaitus. The upper part of the face shows a remarkable predomin- ance, dependent upon the early development of the frontal bone and the great capacity of the orbits. . The middle portion, or the superior maxilla, on the contrary, is very much contracted by the absence of the maxillary sinus and canine fossa; the vertical dimensions of the superior maxilla and of the palate bone are so smaU, that the edge of the orbit and the alveolar border are almost contiguous. We should mention here that the prominence of the alveolar border, which stiU mcloses all the germs of the teeth, is the principal cause of the absence of the canine fossa. Lastly the inferior maxilla is contracted in its vertical diameter, like the supe- rior and like it, presents a decided prominence in front, by reason of its in- closing the germs of the teeth in the alveoU. The inclusion of the denta^ germs also by causing the alveolar border to project, produces a degree of obliqmty downwards and backwards of the symphysis; to these causes of the snmU ex- tent of the vertical dimension of the face, we must add also the mconsiderable height of the ethmoid at this period. i„„„i „f The transverse dimensions of the face are very considerable at the level of the orbits; at the lower part of the face on the contrary, they are proportion- allv much less than in the adult. T-h^ cha acteristics,then, of the face of the foetus are, 1. the smallness of its vertical^mension; 2. the predominance in size of its upper over its lower ^^'^^ In the adult, the development of the maxillary sinus, the widening and vertical extension of the alveolar arches, give to the face the expression which '''^"irt'aM tEoK'thr^^h, and.the disappearance of the alveolar eiae part vTstore to the face the expression which it had m the fetus; but S elongation and prominence of the chin, which from the dmiinution of theFACE IN GENERAL. 85 o 3 vertical diameter approaches the nose, and the symphysis of which is now c lique from behind forwards and downwards, impress upon it a peculiar ct racter. The obliquity of the chin just mentioned, is precisely the reverse that which exists in the foetus. State of the Lateral Regions in different Ages. These regions undergo the fewest changes of aU; for if on the one hand, the development of the maxillary sinus tends to increase the prominence of the maxillary tuberositv in the adult, on the other, the inclusion of the dental germs in the superior maxiUa, during fcetal life, compensates for the want of the sinus. State of the Posterior Region of the Face at different Ages. In the guttural portion, this region presents in the foetus and the infant the following circumstances:—the posterior borders of the rami of the jaw are very ' oblique, instead of being abnost vertical, as in the adult; the pterygoid processes and the posterior nasal openings are also directed very obliquely downwards and forwards, instead of vertically, on account of the absence as yet of the maxillary sinus, which during its development carries them backwards. From the obliquity of the posterior border of the ramus of the jaw, it follows that the articular surface of the condyle which surmounts it looks backwards instead of upwards. In the horizontal or palatine portion, the inferior region of the face has pro- portionally less extent from before backwards than in the adult, on account of the obliquity of the pterygoid process, and the slight development of the max- Ulary sinus. We perceive then how great an influence the varying conditions of these sinuses exercise over the whole configuration of the face, at the dif- ferent periods of life. It may be easily conceived that the cavities of the face must undergo im- portant changes, during these alterations in the shape of the face which we have been describing. The most remarkable is the tardy development of the nasal fossae compared with that of the orbits. It may even be said that they proceed in an inverse ratio. The orbital cavity, intended to receive the globe of the eye which is already highly developed at the time of birth, is of great capacity. This magnitude it owes entirely to the rapid growth of the frontal and sphenoid bones; because the malar bone and the superior maxilla contribute but little towards it, and the height of the ethmoid is so small, that the vertical diameter of the orbit, which depends upon that of the ethmoid, is less considerable than its transverse diameter. The nasal fossae, which are very small in the foetus, gradually acquire an increased extent of surface, by the growth in height of the ethmoid, the palate bone, the superior maxillary, and the vomer, and by the augmented size of the turbinated bones ; and their surface is still farther extended by the enlargement of the maxillary, sphenoidal, and frontal sinuses, and the ethmoidal cells. The development of the frontal sinus, it may be ob- served, is owing chiefly to the separation of the two tables of the bone, the anterior of which is almost always thrown forwards, the posterior remaining stationary. There are, however, some examples on record, in which it was evident that the sinus was formed almost exclusively by the retrocession of the posterior table.OSTEOLOGY. 86 THE THORAX, OR CHEST. The sternum. — Ribs. —Costal carliluycs. —The tJiorax in general.— Development. The thorax {Sidspat,, the chest) is a sort of bony cage intended to contain and protect the principal organs of respiration and circvdation. The parts which enter into its composition are twelve dorsal vertebrse behind, the sternum in front, and twelve flexible bones, named ribs, on each side. We have already described the dorsal vertebrse, and have now therefore only to notice the sternun!. and the ribs. The Sternum (a b c,fig 38.). The sternum, so named from the Greek word mifvov, the breast, is a kind of flattened symmetrical bony column, which occupies the anterior and middle part of the thorax. It is situated between the ribs, which support it like props. The clavicles, and through them the upper extremities, rest upon its upper part as a basis, during their movements. The sternum is not immoveably fixed in its place ;' it is raised and depressed as we shall point out in descnbmg the mechanism of the thorax. . ■ e i The length of the sternum, which is proportionally smaUer in the temale, than in the male, varies from 5^ to 1\ inches. At its upper part its breadth is from li to 2 inches ; it then becomes contracted, then again expands, and ter- minates below in a very narrow extremity. Its thickness above is about 6 lines ; at its lower part it is much thinner, never exceedmg 3 Imes. With regard to figure, the sternum was compared by the ancients to the sword of a gladiator, and from this have arisen the denominations given to its various parts The upper part (a), which is broadest, has been caUed the handle (manubrium) ; the middle part (6) the body {mucro); and h>wer e^ tremity (c), the point; xiphoid appendix {processus ensiforms).

In length, shape, and direction, it presents numerous varieties: it is frequently bifid, sometimes pierced by a foramen and is occasionaUy bent forwards, or to one side, and in certam cases much depressed: its summit gives attachment to an aponeurotic structure, called the Unea alba; behind, it indirectly corresponds with the stomach, which rests upon it when the body is placed in a prone position. . „ , Connections. The sternum articulates with sixteen bones; viz. fourteen ribs through the medium of their cartilages, and the two clavicles. Structure. It consists of two very thin compact lammae, with an mter- venmg spongy substance, the ceUs of which are very large, and have Tery delicate parietes: it is one of the most spongy bones of the body, and to this circumstance the frequency of its diseases is doubtiess attributable. Development. The sternum is one of the slowest bones m its ossification; up to the sixth month of foetal life the broad cartilage of which it is com- posed exhibits no bony points. It is also, of all the bones, the one m which the phenomena of ossification proceed with least regularity. For the sake of sim- plicity we shall study in succession the development of the three parts which we have indicated, under the names of manubrium, body, and xiphoid appendix. 1, Ossification of the manubrium. This part of the bone sometimes presents a single nucleus, rounded, and transversely oblong; sometimes it presents two nuclei, and in this case they may be either placed one above the other, or side by side. In the former case the uppermost nucleus is the larger; in the latter, both may be symmetrical and of equal size, or what is far more common they may be of unequal magnitude. Lastly, the manubrium occasionally presents more than two osseous points. Albinus found three in one subject and four in another. It should be remarked, that in the case of plurality of osseous points, the largest are generally situated above: the exceptions to this rule are very rare. The osseous points make their appearance from the fifth to the sixth month of fcetal life. 2. Of the body. The osseous nuclei which enter into the composition of the body of the sternum have generally a rounded form when they are single, and are situated in the median line; when they exist in pairs, or are placed late- rally, they are more elongated, but smaller, and appear to represent only the half of one of the single nodules. These different osseous points are always so arranged as to be situated between two costo-sternal articulations, so that a portion of the sternum is developed in each of the intervals comprised between88 OSTEOLOGY. two ribs. The last piece is the only exception, being common to the articu- lation of the sixth and seventh ribs. If there be more osseous points than one in an intercostal space, these, as Albinus has remarked, are invariably placed laterally, not one above the other. There are, therefore, four primitive pieces in the body of the sternum, and each of these is sometimes formed by one point of ossification ; at other times by two lateral points. The following is the order in which the ossification of the body of the sternum proceeds : the two upper pieces first appear from the fifth to the sixth month of foetal life; the third is visible at the sixth month ; the fourth most commonly makes its appearance after birth, but sometimes towards the end of gestation. In the ossification of the body of the sternum, we more frequently find ex- amples of two symmetrical nodules placed on opposite sides of the median line, than in the development of the manubrium. Union of the points of ossification of the body. In considering the union of the different parts which compose the body of the sternum, it is necessary to make a distinction between the lateral conjunction, that is, the union of the osseous points which are situated on each side of the median line, and the vertical conjunction, or the union of the pieces of the sternum properly so called. The lateral conjunction, or the union of those osseous germs which form a pair in the same interval, always precedes the vertical conjunction. The vertical conjunction, or the union of the pieces of the body of the sternum together, commences with the two inferior portions. After this union, the body of the bone consists only of three parts. The second piece then unites with the lower; the sternal foramen is found sometimes at the junction of these last mentioned parts, sometimes at tbe place where the two lateral points of the fourth and of the third portion of the body are united. The first piece of the body is not imited to the two others until from the twentieth to the twenty-fifth year. It should be observed that the union of the divisions of the body of the ster- num takes place precisely in the inverse oi-der of their appearance. In fact, the appearance of the osseous points proceeds from above downwards, their union from below upwards; a fact which verifies an assertion formerly made, viz. that the order of development of osseous points is not always correlative to the order of conjunction. 3. Ossification of the (/.ppendix. This is generally accomplished by one nodule: sometimes there are two, and then they are rarely symmetrical. The process commences in the upper part of the cartilage, and very rarely extends through the whole. The time of appearance of the osseous point is extremely variable; sometimes it is visible towards the third or fourth year; sometimes not until the twelfth or even the eighteenth year. In adult age, the sternum is composed of the three parts, the development of which I have just noticed, and which the ancients considered and described as distinct bones. From the fortieth to the fiftieth year, and sometimes later, the appendix becomes united to the body, which very rarely joins the manubrium; when such is the case, the union is more apparent than real; for if the bone be cut vertically, the articulation is apparent, under a very thin layer of osseous matter. . . .~ . ■ ■„ , From what has been said of the numerous varieties of ossification, it will be evident that it is impossible to assign to this bone a limited number of osseous points. To those which have been noticed, I would add two others, described by Be'clard under the name of supra-sternal points, which I have seen once only in the sternum of an adult, in the form of pisiform nodules, placed on each side of the semilunar notch of the sternum.89 THE KIBS. FiS- 38. The Ribs (1 to 21, Jiff. 38.)- The ribs (rostcB, from custodes, as if, according to the explanation of Monro, ^ they were the guardians of the organs of the chest) are osseous arches stretched from the ver- tebral column to the sternum. Their posterior four-fifths con- sist of bone, the anterior fifth is cartilaginous. The osseous portion is the rib, properly so called; the cartilaginous por- tion is named the costal car- tilage. The ribs are 24 in number, 12 (1 to 12) on each side. Sometimes there are 26, thir- teen being on each side, and then these supernumerary ribs are formed either from a part of the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, or of the transverse process of the first limibar, which affords an evident proof of the ana- logy existing between these parts. Sometimes, but more rarely, there are only 22 ribs, an anomaly pointed out by Galen. In this case, we some- times find two adjacent ribs united throughout their entire length, sometimes the first rib in a rudimentary state, being properly formed posteriorly, but having its anterior extremity lost among the muscles, or united to the second rib. The ribs are divided into two classes: 1. those which extend from the ver- tebrae to the sternum, the true ribs, sternal or vertebrosternal ribs (1 to 7); 2. those which do not reach the sternum, the fabe, asternal or vertebral ribs (8 to 12). The last two false ribs 1[H12) are caRed Jioating, because their anterior extremity is moveable in the fleshy parietes of the abdomen. The ribs are designated numerically first, second, &c. counting from above downwards. It should, however, be observed, that in many surgical works, the ribs are counted from below upwards, which is the easiest method on the living subject. The ribs have certain general characters which distinguish them from all other bones, and certain proper characters, by which one is known from another. General Characters of the Ribs. The ribs resemble flattened bony arches, of about six lines in breadth, and one in thickness, and of lengths varying according to their situation. The first rib is almost horizontal, and the others in succession slope gradually more obliquely from behind forwards, and from above downwards, their anterior extremities being on a much lower plane than the posterior. Considered with regard to their axes, i. e. their absolute direction, the ribs represent portions of a circle which successively increase to the eighth, and diminish again to the twelfth: their curvature is not regular, the posterior part representing the segment of a much smaller circle than the anterior. They are generally twisted upon themselves,90 OSTEOLOGY. so that their two extremities cannot rest at once upon the same horizontal plane. The point where this torsion exists, is marked on the convex surface by an oblique projecting line, called the angle (h) of the rib; but it is not cor- rect to consider the angle of the rib as resulting from this torsion; it appears to me simply intended for muscular insertions. The ribs have a body and two extremities. The posterior or vertebral ex- tremity is thicker than the rest of the bone, whence it has received the name of head («) (capituluvi costce), and presents two Fig. 39. half surfaces (c c, fig. 39.), of which the upper is smaller than the lower, separated by a horizontal ridge. These two facettes articulate with cor- responding surfaces on the bodies of the dorsal vertebra; {d d, fig. 39.). The head is supported by a constricted portion, the neck {k, fig. 38.), which is flattened from before backwards, and is the weakest part of the bone. It presents behind some inequalities which correspond to the trans- verse process of the dorsal vertebra below. Externally to the neck is an emi- nence known as the tubercle (/1) of the rib ; it is divided into two parts, which are united at an angle, viz. an intei-nal and inferior portion (/) smooth and convex, which articulates with the transverse process of the vertebra below the particular rib examined ; and an external rough portion (I), which gives attachment to ligaments. The tubercle is in general most promment m the "^That'part of the rib which is included between the head and the tubercle (neck cervix), is directed from within outwards, and slightly from above downwards, so as to reach the summit of the transverse process of the ver- tebra below Beyond the tubercle the rib still foUows the same direction for not more than fifteen lines; it is then bent decidedly forwards. The situation of this curve which corresponds with the torsion of the edges above mentioned, is at the angle of the rib. The interval which separates the tuberosity from the angle is the thickest and strongest part of the rib. The rest of the rib, which is before the angle, becomes broader and thinner, and is directed forwards, so that, as HaUer expresses it, the line which it de- scribes represents in some measure the tangent of the posterior curve. The anterior extremity (m) has a hoUowed oval facette for receiving the cartilage. BesTdes the objects we have already described, we observe near the anterior extremity of the rib, an oblique line analogous to that which forms the angle, but much less marked. This Une may be considered as formmg the anterior an^llof the ribs, and like the posterior it is intended for muscular msertions. Irom what ha^ been said, we perceive that the ribs present 1. a posterior extremity or head, supported by a neck; 2. an anterior exfrenu/y united to the l^I^r^aJtUage; 3 a body, having an external or cutaneous surface y^hich is convex anTan internal or pulmonary surface, which is smooth and concave ; TZZ-ior edge which is curved, thick, and rounded; and an tnferwr edge wS has a greater curvature than the superior, is thm and sharp, and marked bv a eroove^or furrow on the inner surface, called the groove of the ribs 39 ) -hich receives and protects the intercostal vessels and nerves tsdy the ribs have a double curvature, one of the surfaces, another of the ^'&Sr ^SXr^^tSS^hind with the dorsal vertebr., in front with the --^f ^^^^^'Is^^ci of a rib resembles a long bone ; but the • ^'™^ f„InLn is analogous to that of flat bones.

Its edges are curved, but its surfaces are flat. The curve, which it describes, forms part of the circumference of a much smaller circle than any of the other ribs. The posterior extremity has a small head with a single convex facette (a, fig. 40.), supported by a long thin and cylindrical _ neck (6). The tubercle (c) is very prominent; it occu- pies the external border, and gives an angular appearance to this rib. The anterior extremity (d) is broader than that of any other ribs. Of the two sur- faces, one is directed upwards and sUghtly outwards, the other downwards and a Uttle inwards. The superior surface {fig. 40.) has two depressions separated by a tuberosity (e). The anterior corresponds to the subclavian vein; the posterior to the artery of the same name. The tuberosity which separates them gives attachment to the anterior scalenus muscle. The mternal edge (a e d) is concave, the external (a c d) is convex and has no groove. The first rib has neither a curvature of torsion, nor an angle; so that the whole of it can rest upon the same horizontal plane. The superior surface presents also near its anterior extremity a depression which appears to result from pressure by the clavicle, which I have seen, in some cases, immediately articulated with this bone. The second rib (2, fig. 38.) preserves many of the characters of the preceding, but differs essentially in its length, which is at least double; it belongs to a much larger circle : it has no curvature of torsion, and can rest upon the same plane with its two ends ; the angle is scarcely visible. The external surface is directed upwards ; it presents in the middle a very rough eminence for the attachment of the serratus magnus muscle. The internal surface looks ob- liquely downwards ; near the tubercle it has a very small groove. The third rib {S, fig. 38.) differs from the second by its great length, by the presence of the angle, and by a curvature of torsion sufficient to prevent the two ends from resting at once upon the same horizontal plane. The eleventh and twelfth ribs (U 12, fig. 38.) differ from all the others by the following characters: 1. they form segments of much larger circles than any of the others; 2. their heads have only one articular facette, and this is flattened ; 3. they have no neck, properly so called ; 4. they have no tubercle ; 5. they have no groove ; 6. they have a very thin and pointed anterior ex- tremity. These two ribs differ from each other only, in length, the twelfth being the shorter.OSTEOLOGY. 92 The Costal Cartilages (V to \T,Ji.g. 38.). The flexibility and elasticity of the ribs is partly owing to their structure, but more especially to the costal cartilages which prolong them in front. There are twelve costal cartilages distinguished numerically as first, second, third, &c.; they are separated from each other by intervals, which are vei^y considerable at the upper part of the thorax, but gradually diminish as we proceed downwards : it is not very uncommon to meet with thirteen cartilages on one side, at other times there are only eleven. We sometimes find two car- tilages, which are joined together, and articulated with the sides of the sternum; when there are thirteen cartilages, the supernumerary one generally exists be- tween the third and fourth ribs ; it is thin and as it were rudimentary ; it does not form the continuation of any rib, and terminates insensibly in the muscles. The first seven cartilages (1 to 7) articulate immediately with the sternum; and hence the name of sternal given to the ribs with which they are connected. Of the other five cartilages, the last two (11 12) have no connection with those that precede them; and from this circumstance the name floating has been given to the last two ribs. General Characters of the Costal Cartilages. All the costal cartilages are flattened like the ribs, and precisely resemble in breadth and thickness the bones to which they are attached. The external end is received into a cavity hollowed out in the anterior extremity of the rib: their internal or sternal extremity, which is much narrower than the external, is angular, and articulates with the corresponding angular facettes of the sternum. Their anterior or cutaneous surfaces are slightly convex, and covered by the muscles of the anterior region of the trunk, to many of which they give attachment. Their posterior or mediastinal surfaces are slightly concave. Their superior and inferior edges bound the intercostal spaces, and give attachment to the muscles of the same name. They are altogether dis- tinct from articular cartilages, and have a peculiar tendency to ossify, this pro- cess taking place partly on the surface, and partly from within outwards. Differential Characters of the Costal Cartilages. The costal cartDages increase in length from the first to the seventh and some- times to the eighth, which in this case articulates with the sternum; they di- minish in length from the seventh to the twelfth. This difference depends on the circumstance that the osseous parts of the upper ribs terminate anteriorly in a line directed obliquely from above downwards, and from within outwards, and that the sternum is only about half the length of the lateral wall of the thorax, so that only the first four or five cartilages could join this bone, did not the others bend upwards, so as to reach its sides or join the lower edge of the cartilage abovethe first three cartilages alone therefore follow the same di- rection as the bony rib. The flrst cartilage differs from all the others by its shortness, its thickness and breadth, and its tendency to ossify ; it is almost always bony in the adult; it is often continuous with the sternum, but is some- times only contiguous. The second and third costal cartilages cannot be distin- guished from each other, bat they differ from the rest, in being joined at right angles with the sternum, in not being bent, and in being as broad at their sternal as at their costal extremities. The fourth cartilage becomes bent upwards after having followed the direction of the rib for a little way. The length and curvature of the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs, progressively in- crease : the seventh is at least three inches long, while the fifth is not more than thirteen or fourteen lines ; their inner ends become successively narrowed, so as to correspond with the diminishing cavities on the edges of the sternum; the borders of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth costal cartilages articidate together, and present for this purpose articular facettes supported by emmences. TheTHE THORAX IN GENERAL. 93 cartilages of the eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs graduaUy diminish in length ; ex- ternally they have the same breadth as the rib, and decrease as they pass inwards so as to terminate by a pointed extremity, which is appUed to the lower edge of the rib above. The cartUages of the eleventh and twelfth ribs are extremely short, especially that of the twelfth, which is only a few lines in length ; their internal free extremity loses itself, so to speak, in the substance of the abdominal parietes, so that they are altogether unconnected with the other cartilages. The Thorax in general. The sternum, the ribs, and the whole dorsal region of the vertebral column, form the frame-work of a large visceral cavity, the thorax, intended to contain and protect the chief organs of respiration and circulation. It occupies the upper part of the trimk, between the thoracic extremities ; its boundaries are very well defined above, but below there is not any line of demarcation in the skeleton, between the cavities of the thorax and abdomen ; or rather the bony thorax is common to the thoracic and abdominal viscera. We shall see after- wards that these two cavities are separated from each other by a moveable and muscular septum, called the diaphragm. With regard to capacity, the thorax holds a middle place between the cavity of the cranium and that of the abdomen. In each individual, the capacity of the thorax is exactly proportional to the volume of the lungs ; and as, in general, voluminous lungs co-exist with a highly developed muscular apparatus, it follows that the size of the thorax is no equivocal sign of a vigorous consti- tution. The thorax differs much from the abdominal cavity, in regard to its extensibility, being only capable of very limited alternate movements of dila- tation and contraction. In the structure of the thorax we find the twofold condition of solidity and mobility in so perfect a degree, that the frame-work of which it is composed is equally fitted to serve as a protecting structure and a respiratory apparatus. This limited dilatability contrasts, on the one hand, with the almost indefinite extensibility of the abdominal cavity, and on the other with the absolute want of extensibility in the cranium. We should form a very incorrect idea of the dimensions and shape of the thorax, Lf we were to judge of them by its external aspect while still covered by the soft parts, and surrounded by that species of girdle which is formed by the shoulder round its upper part; for we should then conclude it to be a trun- cated cone, with the base above. On the contrary, when the surrounding parts are removed, the thorax represents a cone, the base of which is in precisely the opposite direction, that is below. The height of the thorax cannot be measured with exactness, because it varies according to the depression or elevation of the muscular septum, which intervenes between the thoracic and the abdominal cavities. We can only say, that the bony frame-work should be divided into two parts, a superior or supra-diaphragmatic, which belongs to the chest pro- perly so called, and contains the lungs and heart; and an inferior, which forms part of the cavity of the abdomen, and contains the liver, the spleen, the kidneys, the stomach, the duodenum, and part of the colon. It should be also remarked, that the supra and sub-diaphragmatic portions of the thorax con- stantly vary in their respective proportions ; and that these variations of height principally take place at the sides, the middle remaming always nearly the same. The transverse diameters increase rapidly from the upper to the lower part of the thorax. The same is true of the antero-posterior diameters, and these also sensibly increase opposite the concavity of the dorsal region of the spme. The antero-posterior diameters are much greater laterally than in the median line, where they are diminished by the considerable projection of the bodies of the dorsal vertebra;. This shortness of the antero-posterior diameters between the sternum and the vertebral column, is in proportion to the small size ot the heart, which is situated in this region, as compared with that of the lungs which occupy the sides.94 OSTEOLOGY. Antero-posterior flatleni7ig. The cone represented by the thorax, is flattened from before backwards. Tliis flattening appears to be connected with the ex- istence of the clavicle ; for we meet with it in all animals provided with this bone, while in those in which it does not exist, the flattening is lateral, i. e. from one side to the othei\ The shape of the thorax is subject to many varieties, as respects different individuals, age, sex, &c. Of the individual varieties some are compatible with health; others are pathological and constitute malformations, the history of which belongs to the subject of diseases of the chest. Sometimes they are con- genital ; at other times they are the result of accidental circumstances which have modified the primitive conformation. In some subjects the lateral exceeds the antero-posterior flattening, and the sternum is prominent, as we habitually see it in the thprax of phthisical patients. Many individual varieties of conformation of the thorax are the effect of frequently repeated, or permanent compressions exercised on the bony cavity. I have seen infants, in whom the thorax was perfectly well-formed at birth, but had been deformed and flattened on the sides by pressui-e from the hands of the nurse. If there be, in fact, a time when the slightest external pressure may be productive of permanent deformity, it is during the first years of life. The. efi'ects of a strong and permanent constriction are also manifest in a very evi- dent manner, in the alterations of the form of the thorax consequent upon the use of stays. This species of constriction affects principally the lower part of the chest; so that the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs are pressed forwards and inwards, because the length and flexibility of their cartilages allow them to yield readily ; and all the viscera which correspond to this species of girdle, undergo very marked alterations in their direction, and even in their figure and position. Thus, the liver, the spleen, and the stomach, are forced upwards and compress the lungs, which, in their turn, are pushed to the upper part of the chest, and have a tendency to pass considerably beyond the level of the first rib : 2. the stomach becomes more obUque : 3. the transverse arch ot the colon is often forced downwards; the pregnant uterus acqmres an obhque direction In an old female, whose thorax was so contracted below as to pre- sent the appearance of a barrel, and bore witness to the use of a very tight corset, the cartilage of the seventh rib, on the right side, was in contact with that of the opposite rib; the xiphoid appendix was strongly depressed, and pushed behind the cartUages of the seventh and eighth ribs which touched each other Some varieties of conformation depend upon deviations of the vertebral column ; they evidently belong to pathological anatomy, and need not occupy our attention. In the female, the chest resembles a cone with a larger base but of less height than in the male. There are certain varieties at different ages, which will be noticed m the history of the general development of the thorax. As the thorax does not form a regular cone, when we speak of its ax« being directed obHquely from above downwards, and from behind forwards we only Ser to its anterior waU; the posterior and lateral bemg altogether devoid of * W?Snow consider in detaU the external and the internal surface of the thorax; the kiferior circumference or base, and the superior circumference or summit, resulting from its conical form.

They increase m width from above downwards, and form a sort of inchned plane, with a curved surface, and obliquely directed from above downwards, and from -^thin outwards. The first two intercostal spaces are both the broadest and the shortest; the third and fourth are broader in front than behind ; the foUowing are of ahnost uniform width through their whole extent: on the whole, the breadth of the spaces diminishes from above downwards, or, as Bertin remarks, the edges of the lower ribs are abmost in contact. The last two intercostal spaces form the only exception, for they are nine lines in width, while those in the middle of the chest are only about four. It should, moreover, be remarked, that the intercostal spaces are broader in front than behind ; a fact which may be easily shown by comparing the distance which separates the anterior ex- tremities of the first and second ribs, with that which intervenes between their posterior terminations. The length of the intercostal spaces increases from the first to the sixth; it then diminishes to the two last, where it is very small. Internal Surface of the Thorax. This surface, like the external, is divided into four regions The OMterior region exactly resembles the anterior region of the external surface, with this difference only, that it is concave instead of being convex. The posterior region presents, 1. in the median line, the dorsal portion of the spinal column, which like an incomplete septum forms a projection in the in- terior of the thoracic cavity, and divides it into two equal parts; 2. on the sides, two deep grooves which are contracted above, but gradually enlarge towards the lower part. These grooves, which lodge the posterior convex por- tions of the lungs, exist only in the human subject; they aUow part of the weight of the body to be thrown backwards, — an arrangement which is veiy advantageous for preserving the equilibrium in standing, and is a proof that man is destined to the erect posture. The lateral regions form an inclined plane on the inside, resembling that which exists on the outside, only they are concave instead of being convex. Superior and Inferior Circumferences. The superior circumference or summit is narrow in comparison with the in- ferior, and slopes obliquely from above downwards and forwards; it is wider transversely than in the antero-posterior direction, and resembles the shape of a heart on playing cards. The circumference of this opening is formed in front by the upper end of the sternum ; behind, by the first dorsal vertebra; on the sides, by the first ribs and their cartilages. This opening, which is contracted m its dimensions by the clavicles, gives passage to the following organs ; the96 OSTEOLOGY. trachea, the CESophagus, the thoracic duct, the large arteries and veins of the head, neck, and thoracic extremities, the apex of the lungs, and several muscles of the neck. The inferior circumference or base, is very wide, at least four times larger than the preceding, and, like it, broader transversely than from before back- wards. It presents, 1. in front, a wide notch, the borders of which are formed by the cartilages of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs, but are incom- plete between the tenth and eleventh, as also between the eleventh and twelfth ; at the apex of this notch is the ensiform cartilage; 2. behind, we find on each side of the vertebral column a notch of much smaller dimensions than that in front; it is caused by the great obliquity of the twelfth rib, which forms an acute angle with the spine. The inferior circumference of the thorax is con- nected with muscles, by numerous attachments. The great mobility enjoyed by the lower aperture of the thorax, which, as we have seen, is subjected to alternate movements of dilatation and contraction, contrasts remarkably with the almost absolute immutability of the superior aperture. The lower opening presents certain varieties in dimension which are observed chiefly during inspiration, or are occasioned by accidental causes of dilatation, such as pregnancy or the accumulation of fluids in the abdominal cavity. ■ This variability of its dimensions has reference to the compressibility and dilatability of the abdominal viscera. Such an alteration at the upper opening would have caused serious inconvenience by compressing the trachea and the vessels. General Development of the Thorax. The shape and dimensions of the thorax vary considerably at difierent periods of life ; it is of great importance to be well acquainted with these, because they bear constant relation to changes in the organs contained within the cavity. One of the most remarkable characteristics of the foetal thorax, is the pre- dominance of the antero-posterior over the transverse diameter; at this age, we find the sternum very far separated from the spine, and forming a consider- able projection in front. • This arrangement coincides with the largely deve- loped state of the heart, and an organ denominated the thymus gland, which are both situated in the middle of the thorax; and also with the smaU size of the lungs, which are situated lateraUy. Another marked feature m the chest of the foetus is the absence, or at least the sUght depth, of those grooves which we have described as peculiar to man, and intended to lodge the posterior edge of the lungs. The absence of these puhnonary grooves produces, as a necessary consequence, a want of those external projections on the back of the_ thorax, which we find in the adult corresponding with the grooves on the interior These two characteristics, viz. the predominance of the antero-posterior diameter, and the absence of the grooves, both depend on the same Qause, viz. the slight degree of curvature of the ribs in the fcetus. At a more advanced period the curvatures increase, the posterior grooves are eraduaUy developed, the antero-posterior diameter is dimimshed, and the transverse proportionaUy increased, so that there is less difference in the abso- lute capacity of the thorax than would at first sight appear, for the difi-erences we have noticed are in a great measure referrible to the comparative predomm- ance of one or other diameter. We should also remark, that in the f(E us he vertical diameter, particularly at the sides, is much shorter on account of he I^expanded state of the lungs, and the elevation of the diaphragm by the ab- '"TlTl^o'cIr'umferences Ukewise present remarkable differences. In the fcBtus thrsuperior opening has a greater extent from before backwards than ?ans;erselv Sh is precisely the opposite of what is observed in the adult ¥rXbr' Tperture is extremely wide in every direction; and this accords wit^the large size of many of the abdominal viscera at this age, and particu- larly of the liver.SUPERIOR OR THORACIC EXTREMITIES. 97 At birth, there is a sudden enlargement of the chest, because the access^ of air increases the hxngs to a double or threefold extent, %vhich up to this period ^ere much contracted. At puberty, the thorax participates m the great de- velopment which the respiratory apparatus undergoes. It is at this time also that malformations of this cavity most frequently become obvious. In adult age, the thorax stiU grows, but in an almost msensible manner. In the aged, the different pieces of the sternum become united by osseous union; the cartilages are ossified; the thorax has a tendency m some degree to form only one piece, which does not permit the different parts to move upon one another. THE LIMBS. The limbs are those long appendages of the body which are connected with the trunk only by one end, and which are completely isolated from it m the rest of their extent. They are also denominated extremities, because they are the parts which are most distant from the centre of the body. They are four ' in number: two superior, or thoracic, so called because they are directly con- nected with the thorax; and two inferior, or abdominal, because they are con- tinuous with the abdominal cavity. These last are intended to support the weight of the body like two pillars, and to transport it from place to place: the thoracic limbs are intended to seize objects or to repel them. The ex- tremities present in their structure certain general circumstances which are essentially characteristic. We shall particularly notice the following :— 1. As regards their form. The bones of the extremities differ in many re- spects both from those of the trunk and those of the head. They generally have the appearance of cyUndrical and elongated levers, superimposed so as to form a column, the parts of which are movable upon each other. 2. The continuity of the extremities with the trunk is established by means of osseous zones or girdles, viz. the shoulder for the thoracic limbs, the pelvis for the abdominal. 3. The bones of the extremities diminish in size and length from the proxi- mal to the distal, or free end. 4. The number of the bones in the limbs augments, as we proceed, towards their free extremity. 5. As a necessary consequence of the augmented number of bones, and of their progressively diminished size, the articulations become more numerous and smaller towards the distal end of the limb. The thoracic and abdominal extremities being constructed upon the same fundamental type, we should never forget, in describing them, that they have numerous analogies, while, at the same time, we notice the differences in each which are connected with its peculiar office.

The thoracic extremities are divided into four parts; which, proceeding from the central towards the distal end, are, 1. the shoulder; 2. the arm; 3. the fore-arm; 4. the hand. The Shoulder. The shoulder, situated at the posterior and lateral part of the chest, is com- posed of two bones, which form by their union a sort of angular lever with a horizontal and a vertical arm. The horizontal arm is represented by the cla- vicle; the vertical, by the scapula. VOL. I. ITOSTEOLOGY 98 The Clavicle {fig- 41.). This lione performs so important an office in the mechanism of the thoracic f extremity that, upon its presence in a cer- tain number of animals, and its absence in j^^^siB^ others, the extremely important distinction * between claviculated and non-claviculated animals Ivas been founded. The clavicle, so called from its supposed resemblance to a key, occupies the superior and anterior part of the thorax, and forms the anterior portion of the shoulder ; it is placed horizontally between the sternum, which is its fulcrum, and the scapula, the movements of which it follows. Its length varies in dif- fei ent individuals, and more particularly in the different sexes ; in the female it is generally longer than in the male. It is a long bone, and forms one of a pair, and is consequently asymmetrical; its inner end {e,fig. 41.) which is the larger, is rounded ; lU outer end (tf) is flattened from above downwards, and it enlaro-'es progressively from without inwards like a cone. Its direction should be carefully studied. Proceeding from its outer end, which is very thin, we find it describing a curve with the concavity forwards {d a),- it then changes its direction, and describes a much larger curve with the concavity looking backwards (a e). The clavicle therefore has two alternate curvatures, re- sembling'an italic S, an arrangement which has the advantage of giving strength to the bone, since each curve becomes the seat of a decomposition of forces which greatly diminishes the violence of shocks directed against it from without inwards. The clavicle may be divided into a body and extremities. The body (a) presents two surfaces, one superior, and one mfenor; and two borders, an anterior and a posterior. . The superior surface (a) of the body, is placed almost immediately under the skin, and offers an extensive and ill-protected surface to the action of fo- reign bodies ; this is one of the causes of the great frequency of fractures of this bone. This surface is covered by the skin, the platysma myoides muscle, and numerous filaments of the cervical plexus of nerves.* Hence direct blows upon the clavicle are accompanied with severe pain, on account of the compression of the nerves of this plexus. We find on this surface near its inner end, a tubercle for the insertion of the sterno-mastoid muscle ; it has also some inequalities for muscular attachments on the outside. The inferior surface, broad externally, and narrow internally like the pre- ceding, is marked by a groove running longitudinally, and lodges the subcla- vian inuscle Near the inner extremity of this surface, there is sometimes a fecettT wh ch articulates with the first rib. Near the outer end there is a very rou 'h tXrosity, and an irregular line directed obliquely from within out- wids and from behind forwards : they are both intended for the msertion of Ttr^nl' ligaments which unite the clavicle and the scapula. The mternal thu-d of this See corresponds to the first rib, which it embraces and cros es at a ferv acuran'le? The middle third corresponds to the first intercostal space, J ^ wWW is senarated hy the brachial plexus, and the axillary vessels ; Jre-^rtl ilirdlsTn rSatio'n to the coracofd process and the articulation of '''T^:1^er^oflXT)-^^^'^^ i« thin externally, becomes expanded into a JS^ t^al^Se '''''^^JtZ^iA^l^^^^^ - 'tstwo inner tHrds, and convex and flnri the body of the clavicle itself travcrsea by a nerve of the cer- • It is not uneommon to find the oooy ui viial plexus.THE CLAVICLE. 99 H 2 rough in its external third; its relations are very important: the subclavian vein runs along it, and it also corresponds to the subclavian artery and the brachial plexus. From this it may be conceived how dangerous fractures of the clavicle might become, if the sharp end of the fragments should penetrate among the nerves or the vessels; it may also be imagined, how forcible de- pression of the clavicle, by compressing the vessels which are distributed to the upper extremity, may suspend the circulation there; and, lastly, we can understand how it is easy to apply a ligature to the subclavian artery, by cutting along the middle of the clavicle. There still remains one important relation to be noticed, viz. the propinquity of the apex of the lungs, from which circumstance it becomes possible to ascertain the sonorousness of this portion of the lungs by percussion on the clavicle. Extremities. The external or acromial end (d) of the clavicle is thin, and flattened from above downwards; it presents a very narrow elliptical facette, which looks downwards and outwards, and articulates with a corresponding surface on the scapula. This is the weakest part of the bone; it lies almost immediately below the skin, and is much exposed to external violence, by which it is sometimes broken. The internal or sternal end (e), on the contrary, is the thickest and strongest part of the bone, and might with propriety be named the head of the clavicle ; it articulates with the sternum, projecting beyond the concave articular surface of that bone in all directions. There are many varieties both of size and direction in the body and ends of the clavicle. By inspection of the inner or outer ends of the clavicle, even in the living body, we may judge at once whether the individual has been en- gaged in a laborious manual emplo3rment. I have been able from the simple circumstance of a marked preponderance of size in the inner end of the left cla- vicle, to declare a priori, and correctly, that the individual on whom I observed it was left-handed. In some clavicles the inner half resembles a quadrangular pyramid. In the female the clavicle is much more slender, and the curvatures are less pronounced, than in the male : the strength and degree of curvature of this bone are proportionate to the laborious and continued exercise of the upper extremity. It may, therefore, be easily conceived how much importance should be attached in forensic medicine to the characters of a bone, the ex- amination of which would of itself be sufiicient to determine whether the body to which it belonged were male or female, and whether the person had been engaged in a laborious manual occupation, or the contrary. Connections. The clavicle articulates with three bones, the sternum, the scapula, and often with the first rib. Internal structure. With regard to its structure, the clavicle appears to hold a middle place between the long bones and the ribs; like the first, in fact, it possesses a meduUary canal; but it approaches the stinicture of the ribs in the contracted dimensions of this canal, and the spongy nature of its ends. In ex- amining many clavicles belonging to the collections of the Faculty of Medicine, I was never able to meet with one that had traces of a medullary canal ex- tending throughout its entire length. Development. The clavicle makes its appearance at a very early period, about the thirtieth or thirty-fifth day: its dimensions, compared with those of the other bones of the thoracic extremities present considerable variations at different ages. In the second month of foetal life the clavicle has already ac- quired nearly three lines in length; at this time it is at least four times the length of the humerus and femur. After the commencement of the third month It IS not more than half as long again as these bones. At the end of the third month it is still longer than the humerus, which does not exceed it iintil the fourth month. Lastly, m the foetus at the fuU period the humerus does not exceed the clavicle in length by more than a fourth, while in the aauit It becomes twice as long.100 OSTEOLOGY. The clavicle has only one primitive osseous point; from the age of fifteen to twenty-eight years, a complementary or epiphysary point is developed under the form of a very thin plate at the anterior part of the sternal end. Fig. 4-i Tlie Scapula {fig. 4-2.). The scapula, or shoulder blade, forms in man the back part of the shoulder ; in a great number of animals it constitutes the en- tire shoulder. Placed like a sort of shield upon the back part of the thorax, for which it serves as a means of protection against external violence, this bone corresponds with the lateral part of the spine, which it approaches or quits according to the dif- ferent movements of the upper extremity, to which it affords a moveable point of attachment. The scapula is proportionally larger in man than in the lower animals. It is an asymmetrical bone, broad, thin, and triangular, presenting two surfaces, three borders, and three angles. The anterior or costal surface is moulded as it were upon the thorax ; it is concave, the concavity bemg named the sub-scapular fossa. In this we observe ridges directed obliquely from above downwards, and from without inwards.* In a weU formed subject, this surface should be exactly fitted to the surface of the thorax; but when the chest is contracted, as in Jbthisical patients, the scapula does not partici- nate in an equal degree in this alteration, and there is consequently a dispio- p'S-Uon and ^ange^of relative position, to suchadegree tjat t^^ ^^I^^^ Z tiStrcetre^^tioT^^^^^^^^^ ^^^St:4^^Sr(^...) is divided ^^^^^ even in very corpulent individuals. external and the posterior &,pos the summit and because this pi ocess fmms th^^ shUer.

The whole of the posterior surface of the scapula, above the scapular spme, forms the supraspinous fossa (/), which is narrow at its outer part, and a little enlarged and shallower at the inner, and is filled by the supra-spinatus vMscle. AU that is below the spine forms the infraspmous fossa (g), which is occupied by the infra-spinatus muscle. Towards the outer part, this fossa presents a vertical ridge which marks ofiP a narrow surface, tlonga ed from above downwards, and itself divided by an obUque ridge mto two smaUer sur- faces, the superior (/*) of which gives attachment to the teres minor muscle, and the inferior (i) to the teres ma'or. n j Of the three borders or coste of the scapula the internal, which is also called theZ-fwe, posterior costa,or vertebral border (k d I), is the longest of the three in the human subject; in the lower animals it is the shortest. It is thin, slopes fi-om without inwards in the upper fourth of its extent, and from within outwards in the three inferior fourths, which gives it an angular form. The spme of the scapula meets the base ac this angle (d). The superior or cervical border, or superior costa (k ?•), is the thinnest; we observe on it a notch (r) of variable size, which is converted into a foramen by means of a ligament, and gives passage to the supra-scapular nerve, occasionally also to the vessels of that name The external or axillary bol der, or inferior costa (s Z), is the thickest part of the scapula. It is separated from the thorax by an interval, the extent of which determines the depth of the cavity of the axilla. Its thickness increases from the lower to the upper part, where there is a depression (s) from which the long head of the triceps muscle arises. Angles. Two of the three angles of the scapula are intended for the at- tachment of the principal muscles belonging to this bone; the third enters into the formation of the shoulder joint. The internal angle {k) is that which approaches most to a right angle. In robust subjects it presents a marked impression for the insertion of the levator anguli scapulae muscle. The inferior angle (/) is very acute, and is marked internally by inequalities for the attachment of the serratus magnus. This angle is only covered by the skin and the latissimus dorsi muscle, and is consequently more liable than the other two to fracture from external violence. The external or glenoid angle (in) is the thickest pa.rt of the scapula : it is hollowed into an oval cavity, the long diameter of which is vertical, and the small end of the oval uppermost. This cavity, called the glenoid cavity (ni) of the scapula, belongs to the shoulder joint; it is supported by a contracted portion (n) called the neck of the scapula, and is surmounted by a strong pro- cess (o) named coracoid from a fancied resemblance to the bUl of a raven. This process is directed outwards and forwards like a finger in a state of semi- flexion : its lower surface which looks outwards is concave and smooth, and is curved to correspond with the head of the humerus ; its upper surface is con- vex and rough, and articulates with the clavicle.?' Its summit is rough, and affords attachment to muscles. " Connections. The scapula is articulated with the clavicle and the humerus. Internal structure. There is very little spongy substance in the composition of the scapula, as may be well observed in the supra and infra-spinous fossse, where we can scarcely make use of a file, without breaking through the very thin lamina of compact tissue of which the bone is composed at these points. The spongy tissue occupies the axillary border, the spine, the articular angle, the acromion, and the coracoid process. Developmeni. The scapula is developed from six points ; one primitive for the body of the bone, and five epiphysary or complementary, viz. one for the H .3102 OSTEOLOGY. coracoid process, two for the acromion, one for tlie posterior border, and one for the inferior angle. The osseous point of the body appears towards the end of the second month of utero-gestation in the infra-spinous fossa, under the form of an irregularly quadrilateral plate of bone, on the surface of which we cannot perceive any vestige of the scapular spine. It is not until the third month that this process becomes apparent; and at that period the ossification has made so little progress towards the upper part of the bone, that the spine, which subsequently is situated below the upper fourth of the scapula, is then suflBciently elevated to project beyond the upper part of that bone. The spine is never developed from a separate point, but sprouts as it were from the posterior surface of the bone. . , • 1. V The osseous point of the coracoid process appears sometimes at birtn, but generally during the first year. _ The osseous germ of the base of the acromion process, which has a rounded form, is developed before the fifteenth year. That of the summit of the acromion does not become visible, until from the fifteenth, to the sixteenth year; that is the time at which the coracoid process is united to the body of the bone. It is very variable in its shape, being sometimes like a narrow band, sometimes forming by itself the greatest part of the process. The osseous point of the inferior angle of the scapula is developed during the course of the fifteenth year. , , , The osseous point of the vertebral border extends along the whole posterior costa as a long marginal epiphysis, analogous to that which we shaU after- wards describe as existing on the haunch bone. It is not formed till the seven- teenth or eighteenth year. ^-i xi. The union of these different osseous points does not commence until the fifteenth year, at which time the coracoid process becomes joined to the body of the bone The other points unite at various periods, which have not yet been determined with much exactness. The osseous point of the vertebral border remains the longest separate of all. The union of all these pomts is not completed until the time when the growth of the body is terminated. Tlie Shoulder in General. Considered as forming only one piece, the shoulder represents a bony girdle intended to serve as a fulcrum to the upper extremities. This girdle is in- comnlete in front opposite the sternum, and behind in the region ot the vertebral column. From this it follows, that the two shou ders are mde- pendeni in their motions, while the pelvis, which forms an analogous structure for the lower extremities, is a continuous whole, the difierent parts of which cannot mlve upon each oiher. The shoulders are fixed upon the upper part of thP thorax and so greatly increase its apparent dimensions, that the chest, wLn they ^rTattached, rJsembles a cone with the base upwards while in its True shape it is a cone ;ith the base below. The shoulder is moulded exactly upon the thorax in front and behind; on the outside it is separated from it by an interval which forms the apex of the axilla.

General Development of the Shoulder.THE HUMERUS. 103 H 4 Fig. 43. curvature ofthe fetal clavicle, atatime when all the long bones are still straight, prove the rapidity with which this part of the skeleton is developed On the other hand, the size of the scapula, which is already considerable and the very advanced state of ossification of the part that sustains the glenoid cavity, which enables it very soon to afford a sufficient resistance to the movements of the hume- rus, equally concur in demonstrating the same fact. This rapid development can- not be attributed to the near vicinity of the heart and great vessels, because the sternum and the cervical vertebrffi, which are still more closely approximated to the centre ofthe circulation, are proportionally much slower m their ossification. The Aem. The Humerus {Jig. 43.). The humerus, or bone of the arm, is situated between the shoulder and the forearm, at the side of the thorax. It is the longest and the strongest of all the bones of the upper extremity. It is pro- portionally shorter in individuals of the Caucasian or white races, than in the Ethiopian, which in this respect presents some analogy to the Ape tribes. Its direction is vertical, that is, parallel to the axis of the trunk, but with some degree of obliquity downwards and inwards. This obliquity is much greater in the femur, the bone of the lower extremity which corresponds with the humerus. The distance between the humeri is much greater in man than in quadi'upeds, cor- responding with the different shape of the thorax, which, as we have before observed, is flattened from before backwards in the human subject, and laterally in quadrupeds. The hu- merus is not curved as regards its axis, but it presents a very marked curvature of torsion, which gives rise to a remarkable groove, that lodges the deep artery and the radial nerve as they turn round the bone'm a part of their course. The humeiTis is a long asymmetrical bone, presenting for examination a body (a) and two extremities {b c); the upper of these is rounded, and is called the head (6). The lower half of the body of the humerus is prismatic and triangular; the upper is cylindrical. It has three sur- faces an external, an internal, and a posterior, and three edges. an external, an internal, and an anterior. The external surface {d e) presents, 1. a remarkable mus- cular impression, shaped like the letter V, with the point turned downwards ; this is the deltoid impression (d), and is generally situated below the upper third of the bone, but sometimes at the middle: 2. the groove of torsion (/) directed obliquely downwards and foi-wards, the depth of which is always proportional to the prominence of the deltoid mark. Below the groove the external surface (e) looks forwards, and is slightly con- cave. The internal surface (a) is an oblique plane, looking forwards and inwards ; the brachial artery runs along it, and therefore it is of importance to be well acquainted with the obliquity of the surface, in order that when it is necessary to compress the vessel force may be applied in the proper direction. Its upper part which looks forwards, is broader than the lower which is turned inwards. On this surface we observe, 1. the bicipital groove (g) which will be particularly noticed afterwards,; 2. the principal nutritious foramen (v) of the humerus, ■which passes downwards into the interior*; 3. an obscui'ely marked impression for the coraco-brachialis muscle. * There are some varieties in the situation of the nu'.ritious foramen, external, or even posterior surface ofthe bone. I liave seun it on tlie104 OSTEOLOGY. The posterior surface is smooth, round, and much broader below than above; it is covered by the triceps. Of the three edges, the anterior (A i) is a rough ridge, round and blunt below, bifurcated above, so as to form the two borders of the bicipital groove (g), which is one of the largest and deepest of all the tendinous grooves in the body, and lodges the tendon of the long head of the biceps. The two borders (the exter- nal (A) and the internal (k) are very prominent and rough, and afford attach- ments to powerful muscles. It should be remarked that the anterior branch of the V, represented by the deltoid impression, is blended with the anterior edge of the bicipital groove, and greatly increases its prominence. The other two edges of the humerus, viz. the external (d Z) and the in- ternal (v r) are blunt and scarcely distinguishable in their upper two-thirds, but sharp and prominent at their lower parts, especially the external edge, which curves forwards and gives attachment to a great number of muscles. This edge is also interrupted in its course by the groove of torsion. The lower or cubital extremity (c) of the humerus is flattened from before backwards, with a transverse diameter four times longer than the antero-pos- terior. It presents a series of eminences and depressions arranged in the same transverse line, viz. counting from without inwards, 1. an external tuberosity (I) called epicondyle by Chaussier, which forms a continuation of the outer border, and gives insertion to almost all the muscles on the back of the forearm: 2. the small head (m) of the humerus (Awmera/ condyle of Chaussier), a rounded eminence, bent forwards and oblong from before backwards. The small head articulates with the radius and is surmounted in front by a superficial depression intended to receive the rim of the shallow cup-like cavity on the top of the radius, 3. An articular furrow (n) extending obliquely from behind forwards, and from without inwards, and separating the small head from 4. the trochlea(c) or articular pulley of the humerus, which is also directed from behmd forwards, and from without inwards, is excavated like the groove of a pulley m its long diameter, and the inner border of which descends much lower than the outer. This trochlea articulates, with a corresponding surface on the ulna, and is surmounted in front by a smaU cavity named coronoid (o), and behind by a much larger depression, the olecranoid cavity. These two cavities, the anterior of which receives the coronoid process of the uMa during flexion of the fore- arm and the posterior, the olecranon, during its extension, are only separated from each other by a very thin translucent lamina of bone, which is sometimes perforated, so that they communicate with each other. 5. The internal tuberosity or epitrochlea (r)* which is bent inwards, is much more prominent than the external, forming a projection which can be easily felt under the skin, and gives attachment to ahnost all the muscles situated on the anterior aspect of TheTup^nor or scapular extremity of the humerus, much larger than the inferior nresents, 1. the head (i), a sphenoidal eminence, forming about one- tWrd o?a Se. It articulates with the^lenoid cavity of the scapula and is bounded in the two upper thirds of its circumference by a circular furrow The constriction resulting from this furrow has been improperly cal ed the InatZical v^ck of the humerus (s).

The smaller, which is in front, gives attachment to the sub-scapular muscle; the larger which is ex- ternal, presents three surfaces, each of which gives attachment to a muscle Connections. The humerus articulates with the scapula, the radius, and the "^/nternaZ structure. The two extremities of the humerus are cellular; the middle is compact. It has a very large meduUary canal. Development. The humerus is developed from seven points; one for the body, two for the upper end, and four for the lower. The first osseous point appears in the middle of the bone from the thirtieth to the fortieth day, in form of a small solid cylinder, which progressively extends towards both extremities. At birth, and during the course of the first year, the extremities are still cartilaginous. Theossific point of the head of the humerus appears at the commencement of the second year; and that of the great tube- rosity from the twenty-fourth to the thirtieth month. It has not in my opinion been proved that there is any special point for the lesser tuberosity. The ossifi- cation of the lower end of the bone commences after that of the upper. At two years and a half an osseous point is developed, corresponding to the small head or condyle of the humerus; at seven years another nodule appears in the epitrochlea; at twelve years a third point, which forms the inner edge of the trochlea; and lastly, at sixteen years, a fourth point for the epicondyle. The two points of ossification of the upper end of the bone unite from the eighth to the ninth year. The four points of the lower end are joined together in the following order : in the twelfth year the two points of the trochlea, in the sixteenth year the trochlea, the epicondyle, and the small head. The two extremities are united to the shaft from the eighteenth to the twentieth yeai'. The union of the lower end always precedes that of the upper by one year, although the latter first becomes ossified. The Forearm. The Ulna {fig. 44.). The ulna, or cubitus, so called because it forms the elbow, is situated between the humerus and the carpus, on the inner side of the radius, with which it articulates above and below, but from which it is separated in the middle. It is the longer and the larger of the bones of the fore arm. When the whole limb is in the vertical position, this bone slants a little from above downwards and outwards. It is a long and asymmetrical bone, much larger above than below, pris- matic, triangular, and slightly twisted upon itself: it is divided into a shaft and extremities. The body or shaft (a) of the bone is larger above than below, is slightly curved forwards, and has three surfaces and three edges. Fig.44. The anterior surface (a) is broad above, and becomes gradually narrower towards the lower part. On it we observe the nutritious foramen (above a), which penetrates from below upwards, i. e. in precisely the opposite direction of the nutritious canal in the hume- rus. The posterior surface (d) is slightly convex, and is divided lon- gitudinally by a prominent vertical line into two portions, the inner of which is the broader. The internal surface is very broad above, and much smaller at its lower end, which is immediately subcuta- neous. It is smooth throughout its whole extent. Of the three edges the external (e) is the sharpest, especially in the middle; it commences above, below a small articular surface, and is eflfaced at tlie lower part of the bone It gives attachmeilt to the interosseous ligament, a sort of fibrous membrane stretched between the radius and ulna. The anterior edge (it / m) is blunt, and is intended for muscular in-OSTEOLOGY. 106 sertions ; towards its lower part it bends slightly forwards, becomes rough, and terminates in front of a pointed eminence caWed the styloid process (m) : it com- mences above by a very marked projection (n), on the inside of an eminence named the coronoid process of the ulna. The posterior edge commences below the olecranon by a bifurcated extremity ; it terminates insensibly towards the lower fourth of the bone; this edge may be felt beneath the skin throughout its whole extent. The superior or humeral extremity {b) of the ulna presents a considerable en- largement ; it is hollowed in front into a hook-like cavity, which articulates with the trochlea of the humerus, to the shape of which it is adapted. This cavity, which forms almost half the circumference of a circle, is called the great sigmoid cavity {b g h) of the ulna, because it has been compared to the letter sigma of the Greek alphabet. It has a vertical branch, which forms the olecranon process (b), and a horizontal one named the coronoid process (A). There is a sort of constriction at the place (3) where these two branches meet; this is the weakest point of the upper end of the ulna, and is consequently the almost in- variable seat of fractures of the olecranon. The olecranon (i), so named from ciAc'i/j), the elbow, and Kpavov the head, because it constitutes the most prominent part, or head of the elbow, presents, 1. a posterior surface, smooth above, and rough and irregular below, where it gives insertion to the triceps ; 2. an an- terior or articular surface, divided by a vertical ridge into two lateral parts of unequal magnitude; 3. two borders more or less rough, in different subjects, which afford attachments to the triceps muscle ; 4. a base, with the constriction we have before described ; 5. the summit having the form of a curved beak, which is received into the olecranal cavity of the humerus during extension of the fore-arm. The horizontal branch of the sigmoid cavity, or the coronoid process (h), presents, 1. a rough inferior surface C0> on which the brachialis anticus muscle is inserted; 2. a superior surface divided into two unequal parts by a ridge, which is a continuation of that which divides the articular surface of the ole- cranon ; 3. an internal rough edge (71), bent inwards, and giving insertion to the internal lateral ligament of the elbow joint; 4. an external edge marked by a small cavity which is oblong from before backwards, and slightly concave in the same direction, and is called the lesser sigmoid cavity (A) of the ulna : below this small cavity is a rough, triangular, and deeply excavated surface, to which the supinator brevis muscle is attached; 5. an anterior sinuous edge, with a projection or beak which is received into the coronoid cavity of the humerus during flexion of the fore-arm. The lower extremity of the ulna presents a small rounded enlargement (c), which has been called the head of the ulna. We observe on the outside an articular facette (I), convex, and elongated from before backwards, which is received into a corresponding concave sui-face on the lower extremity of the r-idius On the inner side of this head a vertical cylindrical process arises, ca\lei stuloid process of the uhia (m), the point of which gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the wrist joint. The head of the ulna presents below a smooth surface which articulates with the cuneiform bone, a moveable fibro-cartilao-e being interposed ; it isseparated from the styloid process behind bv a groovelfor the passage of a tendon, and on the inside by a slight irregular depression to which the triangular fibro-cartilage is attached. • Connections. The ulna articulates with the humerus, the radius, and the "/2rS S«ci«re. The shaft of the ulna is compact; the two extremities are oplhilar esneciallv the upper, the olecranon process of which resembles a short ronfbothirfSmandstruct^re. Sometimes even as Rosenmuller has observed, this process constitutes really a short bone, entirely separated from the ulna Devdopment. The ulna is developed from three points ; one for the shaft, and one forTach extremity. The osseous point of the body appears first, from ^e thltf-fiftSo t^Jf^^^^^^^^ day, or a little later than that of the humerus.107 THE RADIUS. At birth, the extremities are entirely cartilaginous; they do not begin to ossify untU the sixth year, the lower one having the priority The corouoid process is formed by extension of the ossific point of the shaft. The nodule of the olecranon appears about the seventh or eighth year The upper extremity is united to the shaft from the fifteenth to the sixteenth year; the lower from the eighteenth to the twentieth year. The Radius {fig. 45.). The radius, so named because it has been compared to the spoke of a wheel, is situated between the humerus and the carpus, on the outside ot the ulna, to which it is contiguous above and below, and fi-om which it is separated in the middle by the interosseous space. It is some- what smaller and shorter than the ulna, and has a vertical direction. It is a long and asymmetrical bone, prismatic and triangular in its shape : its lower end is the larger, and its shaft is slightly curved; it consists of a shaft and extremities. The shaft (o), smaller above than below, presents a slight cui'v- ature with the concavity looking inwards : this circumstance in- creases the distance between the radius and ulna, i. e. the inter- /■Vg.45. Il l I osseous space. It has three surfaces, an anterior, a posterior, and an external, and three edges. The anlerior surface (o), narrow '! II above and broad below, presents (above o) the orifice of the nu- tritious canal, which, like that of the ulna runs upwards, or in an opposite direction to that of the humerus. It is somewhat excavated, and gives attachment to many deep-seated muscles of the fore-arm. The posterior surface also slightly hollowed, gives attachment to se- veral of the deep-seated muscles on the back of the fore-arm. The external surface, convex and rounded, is of equal breadth in almost its whole extent, and presents near the middle a rough surface for the insertion of the pronator teres. * Of the three edges one is anterior, the other posterior, and the third internal: the anterior edge (i r s) is blunt superiorly ; it commences below a marked projection, named the bicipital tuberosity, or tubercle of the radius (t); from this point it passes obliquely outwards, and terminates below, in front of another eminence called the styloid process (a) of the radius. The posterior edge, less prominent than the anterior, forms a scarcely perceptible demarcation betweeen the two surfaces which it separates; it is pretty well marked in the middle of the bone, but hardly distinguishable above and below. The internal edge {ty) is sharp, and has the appearance of a ridge; it commences below the bi- cipital tuberosity, and extends to a small articular cavity (jf), on the inner side of the lower end of the bone. This edge gives attachment to the interosseous ligament in its whole extent. The superior or humeral extremity (u), called also the head of the radius, ex- pands in form of a shallow but regularly shaped cup, the cavity corresponding with the small head of the humerus, which it partially receives. It is bounded by a circular border with a vertical articular surface (u), varying in breadth in different points, being nearly three lines broad on the inside where it is in contact with the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna. The head of the radius is supported by a constricted portion, or neck (w), of a cylindrical form, and five or six lines in length, which is obliquely directed from above downwards, and from without inwards. At the junction of the neck and body of the radius, on the inside, we see a very marked process, called bicipital tuberosity (f). Its posterior half is rough, where it gives attachment to the tendon of the biceps ; the anterior is smooth and the tendon of the biceps glides over it, before reaching its point of insertion. _ The inferior or carpal extremity {x), which is the largest part of the radius IS irregularly quadrilateral. Its lower surface is articular, smooth, concave,'OSTEOLOGY. 108 irregularly triangular, and divided by a small antero-posterior ridge into two parts, an internal which articulates with the semilunar bone of the wi-ist, and an external which, articulates with the scaphoid. In the outside of this surface, we observe a pyramidal, triangular process, slightly bent outwards; this is the styloid process (s) of the radius, shorter and much thicker than the styloid process of the ulna, and like it giving attachment to one of the lateral ligaments of the wrist joint. The circumference of this end of the bone ex- hibits in front some inequalities to which the anterior ligament of the wrist is attached; behind and on the outside, it is marked by the following tendinous grooves, viz. proceeding from without inwards, 1. an oblique groove on the external surface of the styloid process, which shows the trace of a longitudinal division marking out two secondary furrows; 2. a groove bounded by project- ing edges, and subdivided into two secondary ones by a longitudinal ridge, less elevated than the lateral border; 3. a somewhat deeper groove, also divided into two secondary furrows of unequal dimensions, by a very prominent line.* On the inside (», the lower end of the radius is shghtly excavated, to articu- late with the carpal extremity of the ulna. Connections. The radius articulates with the humerus, the ulna, the sca- phoid and semilunar bones. Internal structure. The two extremities of the radius are cellular, and are covered by a very brittle layer of compact tissue: the shaft is almost en- tirely formed of compact tissue, and has a very narrow medullary canal. Development. The radius is developed from three points, one for the body, and one for each extremity. The osseous point of the body appears some days before that of tbe ulna; the lower extremity is developed about the second year : the upper at nine years. The upper extremity, which is last m begin- ning to ossify, becomes united to the body of the bone about the twelfth year, whilst the lower extremity is not joined until from the eighteenth to the twentieth year. The Hand {fig. 46.).. The hand is the last part of the upper extremity. It is the organ of touch and of prehension ; and as it serves both tor pur- poses which demand great force, and for such as require extreme delicacy, its osseous part is so constructed as to combine great solidity with great mobility. It is composed of twenty-seven bones, exclusive of the sesamoid bones, rhe hand exists only in man and in the ape; and its importance is so great, that it has been considered by naturalists as establishing a fundamental cha- racter of the species. Man alone constitutes the class of bimana, the apes form the class quadru- mana ; but in the hand of the ape, compared with that of man, we find great inferiority. The hand, considered as part of the skeleton is composed of five series of small columns. Each series consists of four pieces, excepting the outer one, which has three only. The five series of columns converge so as to unite with a bony mass, composed of eight bones (a tot) articulated their junction the base of the hand or the wrist. , — . - ..J^arpus.

The hand is in this position when laying hold ol any thing, or exercising the sense of touch. For facility of description we shall suppose the hand to be in the state of supination, and the palm turned for- wards. The axis of the hand is almost the same as that of the lore-arm. Tlie Carpus (a to f,fig- 46.). The carpus (trom Kap-nhs, wrist, Kafmeiv, to lay hold of) constitutes the bony structure of the wrist; it is of an oblong form, and almost elliptical trans- versely. The anterior surface (fig. 46.) is concave, and forms a deep groove in which the tendons of the flexor muscles are lodged. The posterior surface is convex, and in contact with the extensor tendons. They are both traversed by waved lines, which indicate the numerous articulations of the component bones. The upper border is convex, and articulates with the radius and ulna; the lower is irregular and sinuous, and articulates with the metacarpal bones. At each of the two extremities of the ellipse represented by the carpus, we observe two eminences which form a projection on the anterior aspect, and contribute to augment the depth of the groove which it forms. The two which occupy the outer edge of the wrist are much smaller than those which are situated on its inner border. The structure of the carpus is remarkable in this respect; that in proportion to its size, it presents in a given space a much greater number of bones than any other part of the skeleton. It consists in fact of eight bones, and is scarcely one inch in height, and two inches and a half in breadth. These eight bones are arranged in two series, or rows; an upper proximal or anti- brachial {a b c d), and a lower distal or metacarpal (e i g f). Each of these ranges is composed of four bones ; counting from the external or radial edge towards the internal or ulnar, they are, in the first row, the scaphoid (a), the semilunar (b), the cuneiform (c), (ot pyramidal), and the pisiform (d) ; in the second row, trapezium (c), the trapezoid (i), the os magnum (g), and the unci- forme (/). I shall not occupy time in describing successively the six surfaces on each of these bones. By simply explaining the law which regulates their configu- ration, I shall have the double advantage of avoiding prolixity, and of enabling the student to understand move correctly both their forms and relations.OSTEOLOGY. 110 Bones of the first or Anti-brachial Bange. What I have just said of these bones does not apply to the pisiform, which is distinguished from all the others by particular characters, and merits a special notice. With regard to the rest *, yiz. the scaphoid (a), the semilunar (i), and the cuneiform (c), it may be remarked, 1. that they articulate by their upper surfaces with the fore-arm, forming a sort of interrupted condyle, i. e. one consisting of several pieces, which is received into the cavity formed by the lower end of the radius and ulna. Each of the bones contributes to form this condyle, by means of a convex surface, consequently, the superior surface of the bones of the first rank is articular and convex. 2. They articu- late by their lower surfaces with the bones of the second rank, which on the inside oppose to them a large head formed by the os magnum and unciform, and on the outside a shallow con*lrity which corresponds to the trapezium and the trapezoid. In accordance'with this, the lower surface of the first row presents on the one hand a concavity which receives the head, and on the other a convexity which corresponds to the cavity. Three surfaces, belonging to the scaphoid, the semilunar, and the cuneiform unite to form the cavity, which receives the head belonging to the second row. There is, therefore, a broken cavity, i. e. one formed of several pieces. The scaphoid being the largest of the bones of the first row, and corresponding by itself to the most convex part of the head of the second row, is more deeply excavated than the two other bones; this has given it the form of a boat, whence the name of scaphoid {aKo.^)], a boat). The semilunar, which cor- responds to the summit of the head, presents from before backwards a conca- vity which has given it its name ; the cuneiform, on the contrary, corresponds to the least convex part of the articular head, and has an almost plane sur- face. One bone only, the scaphoid, answers to the concavity formed by the tra- pezium and trapezoides, and it accordingly presents a convex surface at the point of union. Therefore the lower surfaces of the bones of the first row are concave, and the lower surface of the scaphoid is partly concave, and partly convex. 3. The bones of the first row of the carpus unite with each other by plane surfaces ; those of the scaphoid and semilunar, which join, are very small; the contiguous surfaces of the semilunar and the cuneiform are much largei'. The semilunar and the cuneiform, which occupy the middle of the row, ar- ticulate not only with each other, but also with the scaphoid and the pisiform ; and each, therefore, has two lateral surfaces, so that the two middle bones of the row have fom* articular facettes. The scaphoid, which is the outer bone of the first row, articulates internally with the semilunar, but externally it has a projecting process, which may be easily felt under the skin, and which increases the depth of the anterior groove of the cai-pus. This eminence constitutes the external superior process of the carpus. 4. The bones of the first row forming part of the concavity in front, and of the convexity behind, have their anterior surfaces much smaller than their posterior; both are rough, and serve for the insertion of ligaments. The pisiform (d) is not in the same rank, and has only one articular surface, which unites with the corresponding surface on the cuneiform. The whole of the rest of its surface is intended for the insertion of ligaments and tendons. Its name is derived from its irregularly rounded form. It is placed on a plane anterior to that of the other bones of the first row, and forms the internal superior process, which is the most prominent and the most superficial of all the processes of the carpus. * It is necessary, in order to follow this description, and obtain from it all the advantage which it can afTord, to study at the same time an articulated carpus especially one in which the joints are exposed behind, some ligaments remaining in front.Ill THE METACARPUS. Bones of the second or Metacarpal Bow. The bones of the second row are much larger than those of the first; they form, in fact, the support of the metacarpus. In the first row, the outer hone, namely the scaphoid, is the larger; in the second, the two inner hones, viz. the OS magnum ((/) and unciforme (/). Superior surfaces. We have already stated that the surface of the second row, which articulates with the first, presents a head and a cavity. The head is formed almost entirely by a spheroidal eminence, named head of the os magnum ; this is supported by a constricted portion, or neck, below which is the bodi/, the largest part of the bone ; this head of the os magnum is truncated at its inner part, and appears to be completed by a portion of the os unciforme. The con- cavity presented by the bones of the second row is constituted by two bones, the trapezium (e) situated on the outside of the carpus, and the trapezoid (i) placed between the trapezium and os magnum. The inferior surfaces correspond to the bones of the metacarpus. Taken together, these surfaces form a sinuous and angular line, which by itself would I seem to prove the impossibility of dislocation of the metacarpus. The tra- pezium supports the first metacarpal bone; the trapezoid, the second ; the os magnum the third; and the os unciforme the fourtli and fifth metacarpal bones. Th.eposterior surfaces of the bones of the second row form part of the con- vexity of the carpus ; the anterior surfaces are narrower, and correspond with its concavity. There is a process on the anterior aspect at each extremity of the second row ; the internal belongs to the unciform bone, and resembles a hook, the concavity of which looks outwards, and corresponds with the flexor tendons ; the external belongs to the trapezium, and forms a much less prominent hook than that of the unciform; on its inside there is a deep oblique groove for the passage of the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, and it forms the external inferior process of the carpus. Lateral surfaces. The bones of the second row are joined together by broad . plane surfaces, partly articular, and partly non-articular. The two middle bones, viz. the trapezoid and the os magnum, have each two lateral articulai surfaces, inasmuch as they are articulated with each other, and since the os magnum is united to the imciforme, and the trapezoid to the trapezium The extreme bones of this row have only one side articular. Each of the middle bones, therefore, has four articular surfaces, a superior, an inferior, and two lateral; each of the extreme bones a superior, an inferior, and one lateral. Development of the Carpal Bones. All the bones of the carpus, without exception, are developed from single pomts. The ossific points appear very slowly; all the bones are cartilaginous at birth. Towards the end of the first year, the cartilages of the os magnum and the unciforme show a bony point in the centre. The osseous point of the cuneiform appears from the third to the fourth year; those of the trape- zmm and semilunar, from the fourth to the fifth; and those of the scaphoid and the trapezoid from the eighth to the ninth year. The pisiform does not become ossified until from the twelfth to the fifteenth year; in fact, it is the latest to ossify of all the bones of the skeleton. The Metacarpus (k lt',Jig. 46".). The five bony columns which rest upon the carpus form the metacarpus ■ tney are long bones placed paraUel to each other, and constructed on the same model, with very slight differences. Together they form a sort of square grating, the intervals of which are larger, on account of the disproportion cx-112 OSTEOLOGY. isting between the size of the middle part and the ends of these bones. These intervals are denominated interosseous spaces. The metacarpal bones are five in number, distinguished by the names of first, second, &c. They ai'e not perfectly uniform, either in situation, length, or shape. The metacarpal bone of the thumb, for instance, is situated upon a plane anterior to that which the others occupy ; instead of being parallel, it is directed obliquely outwards and downwards, and hence the interosseous space between it and the second metacarpal bone is triangular. This arrangement is connected with the movement of opposition, which is the characteristic feature of the hand. The metacarpus presents a palmar or anterior surface, concave transversely, and slightly so from above downwards, which corresponds with the palm of the hand; a dorsal convex surface, the back of the hand; an external or radial edge, which is short, obliquely directed outwards and downwards, and corresponds to the thumb ; an ulnar edge, short and straight, which corresponds with the little finger ; a superior or carpal ex- tremity, which presents a very sinuous ai-ticular line, to fit the opposite surface of the carpus ; and an inferior or digital extremity, formed by five heads flattened on the sides, and intended to articulate with the corresponding fingers : this lower extremity forms a broken articular line: it is curved, with the convexity downwards, and the first metacarpal bone does not appear to belong to it. General Characters of the Metacarpal Bojies. The metacarpal bones belong to the class of long bones, having the same form and structure ; each consists of a body and two extremities. The body is prismatic and triangular, and slightly curved, so as to present a concavity on the palmar, and a convexity on the dorsal aspect. ' Of the three surfaces of the body, two are lateral, and correspond to the interosseous spaces ; the third is on the back of the hand, and is covered by the tendons of the ex- tensor muscles* Of the edges, two are lateral; the third is anterior, and cor- responds with the palm of the hand. The upper or carpal extremity is large, and has five surfaces, an anterior and a posterior, for ligamentous insertions, and three articular ; of the three articular surfaces one is at the end of the bone, and unites with a corresponding surface on a carpal bone ; the two others occupy the sides of the extremity, and unite with corresponding surfaces of the adjoining metacarpal bones. In some metacarpal bones the lateral facettes are double on each side. It is necessary to distinguish such of these lateral facettes as are intended to unite with bones of the carpus, between which one of the metacarpal bones is, as it were, wedged, from those which are exclusively intended for the articulation of the meta- carpal bones with each other. , , „ , -j The lower or digital extremity resembles a head flattened on the sides, or a cmdvle oblong from before backwards, with an articular surface of greater extent on the palmar than on the dorsal aspect, i.e. admitting of greater flexion than extension ; it is marked both intemally and externally by a de- pression, behind which is a rough projection for the attachment of lateral "^ITe^there any peculiar characters by which the difi-erent metacarpal bones may be distinguished?

At the same time, we must acknowledge that there is a cir- cumstance in its development, which tends to establish its analogy with the phalanges. The carpal extremity of the fir.«t metacarpal bone has a particular form; it is concave from before backwards, and convex transversely, for articulation with the corresponding surface on the trapezium. The cha- racteristic marks then, by which the first metacarpal bone may be recognised, are, its shortness, its greater size, the antero-posterior flattening of the body, the upper articular surface concave and convex in opposite directions, and the absence of lateral articular facettes. There are many distinguishing characters of the second, third, and fourth metacarpal bones. I shall content myself with saying, that the second and third are known by their greater length, for they exceed the fourth by the whole of their lower extremity ; they are also about a third larger and heavier. The third metacarpal bone is distinguished from the second by its greater size, and, accordingly, it gives attachment to one of the most powerful muscles of the hand, the adductor pollicis; it is also known by having two lateral facettes on its upper extremity, while the second has only one. 'DiQ fifth metacarpal bone (k) is the shortest of all excepting the first, from 1 which it is distinguished by its smaller size. It differs from the fourth, which it most resembles; 1. by its shortness; 2. by the presence of an articular facette only on one side of its carpal extremity ; 3. by the existence of a very projecting eminence on its inner side, for the insertion of the extensor carpi ulnaris muscle. Connections. The metacarpal bones articulate with each other, with the bones of the carpus, and with the first phalanges of the corresponding fingers. Internal structure. They have the same structure as other long bones their extremities are cellular, and the shafts compact, with a smaU medullary canal. Development. Each metacarpal bone is developed from two points; one for the body and superior extremity, and one for the lower or distal extremity. The first metacarpal bone, which in many respects resembles the phalanges, is similar also in its mode of development. One of its two points appears in the shaft; the other in the upper or carpal extremity, which is the reverse of what takes place in the other bones of the same denomination, and is analogous to that of the phalanges. The ossific point of the body of the metacarpal bone, appears from the fortieth to the fiftieth day. At birth the body is almost completely ossified, but the extremities are still cartilaginous. The bony points of the lower ends of the last four metacarpal bones, and of the upper end of the first, do not make their appearance until the third or fourth year. In general, the upper ends of the last four bones, and the lower end of the first, are ossified by an extension of the shaft; but I have occasionally seen separate germs for each of these, so that every metacarpal bone had three osseous nodules. The union of the lower extremities with the bodies of the four metacarpal bones, does not take place until the eigtheenth or twentieth year; and the same is the case with the ossific point of the upper end of the first metacarpal bone. In those cases where the lower end of the first meta- carpal, and the upper ends of the others are formed from special points, their union takes place at a much earlier period. The Fingers (I m n, and I' n',fig. 46.). The fingers are the essential organs of prehension, and for this purpose have a length, thickness, and mobility, that are very remarkable, when we com- pare them with the toes, which represent them in the lower extremity. Each tmger forms a pyramid composed of three columns placed upon each other • the base of the pyramid corresponds to the metacarpus; and there are two en- largements or knots at the places where the columns (named phalanges) uniteOSTEOLOGY. 114 together. The three columns which compose each finger successively decrease in size, and are known by the numerical appellations, of first, second, and third. The first, which articulates with the metacarpus, is also called the metacarpal phalanx (t I'); the second, the middle phalanx (ni); and the third, which supports the nail, the ungual phalanx (n «')• '^^^ thumb alone has only two phalanges, an ungual, and a metacarpal. Chaussier has named the phalanges, phalange, phalangine, and phalangette, counting from the base to the ends of the fingers. These denominations he has found very serviceable in the methodical designation of the muscles of the fingers. The first Phalanx (IV). The first phalanx belongs to the class of long bones, and presents to our notice, 1. a body resembling a half cylinder cut along its axis, and slightly curved upon itself, so as to present a concavity in front; the dorsal surface is cylindrical, and covered by the tendons of the extensor muscles ; the anterior surface is slightly channelled for the partial lodgment of the tendons of the flexor muscles, its edges are sharp and give attachment to a tendinous sheath, which converts the channel above mentioned, into an osteo-fibrous-canal for the flexor tendons of the fingers ; 2. an upper or metacarpal end, transversely oblong, and presenting a small glenoid cavity for the head of the corresponding metacarpal bone; 3. a lower end, forming an articular pulley Such are the general characters of the first phalanx, but they are modified in each finger. Thus the phalanx of the middle finger is the longest; those of the index and ring finger come next. The first phalanx of the thumb is the largest in proportion to its length ; the first phalanx of the little finger is the most slender; it is also the shortest, excepting that of the thumb. The second Phalanx (m). The second phalanx difi'ers from the first by its smaller size, and the shape of its upper end, which is fitted to the trochlea on the lower end of the first phalanx The edges of this phalanx are thick and rough above, where they give insertion to the tendon of the superficial flexor of the fingers. The thumb has no second phalanx. The third Phalanx (n n'). This bone to which so much importance has been attached in na.tural history* supports the horny part with which the ends of the digits in animals are arm^d, and the nails in man. It is shaped thus. the upper end is trans- versely oblong, exactly resembling the upper end of the second phalanx; from [his part it contracts like a cone; afterwards it becomes much enlarged and flattened from before backwards, and ends with the shape of a horse-shoe rough in front where it supports the pulp of the finger smooth behind and kdented on the edges. The migual phalanx of the thumb is much larger Sn S of the othfr fingers; that of the middle - nf the index and ring finger are almost equal; and that of the little linger is the smit It is very ^cult to distinguish the phalanges of the right from those of the left hand.

I 2 successively in the first, second, and third phalanges, from the fortieth to the fiftieth day. The order of succession is not subjected to any certain rules. Bony points are found at the same time in the ungual and metacarpal phalanges, and prior to those of the middle phalanges. The ossific points of the upper ends of the phalanges appear successively in the first, second, and third pha- langes some time after birth, from the third to the seventh year. The epi- physary point of the third phalanx is generally developed before that of the second. The epiphyses do not join the bodies of the bones until from the eighteenth to the twentieth year. General Development of the Superior Extremity. The thoracic limb in the foetus and the infant is remarkable for its dimensions, which are proportionally much greater than in the adult. This early develop- ment and size are particularly evident when compared with the slow develop- ment of the lower limb; the resulting disproportion is in an inverse ratio of the age, that is, it is greatest in early life. The thoracic limb of the foetus differs from that of the adult in many other respects besides dimensions. Thus, the two extremities of the humerus are proportionally much larger and altogether car- tilaginous, though the difference does not appear to me so great as has been imagined. The lower end of the bone is especially remarkable for the size of the small head, which forms a very marked protuberance in front, and projects considerably beyond the puUey or trochlea. In the fore-arm, the upper end of the radius is situated much farther forwards than in the adult; which agrees with the position of the small head of the humerus. This circumstance merits careful notice, because it is one of the predisposing causes of dislocation of the head of the radius forwards, the ligament which keeps it back being scarcely able to overcome its tendency in that direction. For the same reason, displacements of the head of the radius are much more frequent in the infant than in the adult. The carpus, almost completely unossiiied at birth, is composed of the same number of cartilages as there are bones afterwards. The metacarpus, on the contrary, is ossified long before birth, but this rapid development, common to the whole thoracic extremity, is most remarkable in the phalanges. Bichat appears to me to have greatly exaggerated the changes which take place in these bones during the progress of age. I am certain that the torsion of the humerus, and the curvatures of the radius and ulna, and also the inter- osseous space, exist equally in the new-born infant as in the adult, and in almost the same proportions.

The inferior or abdominal extremity is divided, like the superior, into four parts, viz. the haunch, the thigh, the leg, and the/oo<. The Haunch. The haunch, which is analogous to the shoulder, is composed of only one bone, the os coxeb or os innommatum. Although the haunch bones are united with the sacrum to form the pelvis, they alone are analogous to the shoulder for the sacrum only forms the same part with reference to the lower extremity" that the dorsal vertebrae constitute for the upper.OSTEOLOGY 116 The Os Coxee, or Os Innominatum (Jigs. 47 and 48.). The haunch bone, called also os coxa, from coxa the haunch, occupies the lateral and anterior parts of the pelvis. It is the largest of all the hroad hones of the skeleton. It is asymmetrical, very irregular in its figure, and twisted upon itself, so that it appears to he composed of two portions; one superior, triangular, shaped like a wing, and flattened from without inwards ; the other inferior, and flattened from before backwards. These two parts are united by a contracted portion. On this bone we have for consideration an external or femoral surface, which corresponds with the thigh, an internal or pelvic surface, and a circumference. On the femoral surface (Jig. 47.) we observe the following parts:—On the contracted portion, which unites the upper and the lower half of the os coxse, is the cotyloid cavity (a. Jigs. 47, 48.)-(from KOTvK-n a cup), or aceta- bulum). This is of a hemispherical shape, and is the deepest of all the articular cavities; it looks obliquely downwards, outwards, and a little for- wards, and has a considerable depres- sion ib,fig. 47.) at the bottom on its inner aspect. The margin (c) of this cavity is sharp and sinuous, and pre- sents three notches, or rather one notch and two slight depressions, one of which is superior, and the other inferior and somewhat external. The notch (f/) is situated below and on the ^ inside ; it is very deep, and converted grooves; the upper one is superficial, aBd g^^«« jl™*: , i^es pansion, one of the origins of the rec<«./cwt.,- the lo^ er is dee^^^^^^ Jassage'to the tendon of the obturator externus^^^^ the OS cox^E presents abroad ^"angular surface ^P'°P^^^ _ foss (e).

On the inside of the obturator foramen is a square surface (k fias 47 and 48 \ broader above than below, oblong in a vertical direction, and i;;Jfor the in rti^^ of several muscles of the thigh This >s contmuous below with another surface (,l,fi9- ^^-l ^roader inferiorly than above, which extends obliquely downwards and outwards, then curves upwards and eimi^ nates below the cotyloid cavity. This surface which bounds the obturator foramen below, is intended for muscular insertions. t* • The internal or pelvic surface 48.) of the os coxffi is concave. It is di- vided into two parts, a superior which looks upwards, and an inferior which looks backwards, by a prominent horizontal ridge (m n o, fig. 48.), which torms the lower boundary of the internal iUac fossa. Above this ndge, which we shaU afterwards see forms the greatest part of the inlet of the pelvis, we tnd, proceeding from behind forwards, 1. a very prominent and rough tuberosity {r), intended for several ligamentous attachments: 2. an irregular articular sur- face, broader above than below, and called the auricular surface (s) ot the os coxiE, from a supposed resemblance to the concha of the ear ; it looks down- wards and inwards, and articulates with a corresponding surface on the sa- crum : 3. more anteriorly, and on a higher plane, a deep and regular excava- tion, correctly denominated the internal iliac fossa (t). This fossa which is broad and smooth, is occupied by the iliacus muscle. At its lower part there is a nutritious foramen, which does not correspond with that on the outside of the bone. Below the horizontal ridge, which divides the internal surface of the os coxae into two halves, we observe, proceeding from without inwards, and from behind forwards, 1. a smooth quadrilateral surface, broader above than below, slightly concave, and sloping from atove downwards, inwards, and forwards; the front of this surface cori-esponds to the depression at the bottom of the cotyloid cavity : 2. behind this surface, a large notch, which will be noticed when describing the circumference of the bone: 3. in front, the inner open- ing of the obturator foramen, at the upper part of which is the commencement of the groove ah-eady described: 4. inside the foramen a quadrilateral surface, narrower below than above, where it forms a plane, sloping downwards and backwards, which corresponds to the bladder: 5. below the same foramen, a smooth surface. The circumference of the os coxa; is very irregular, and consists of a series of alternate projections and notches. We shaU describe four borders in this cir- cumference ; a superior, an inferior, an anterior, and a posterior. The superior border or crest of the ilium (u v, figs. 47 and 48.) is curved like the italic letter S; it is directed from before backwards, is rough, thick, and convex; we shall describe it as having two lips and an interstice, that we may be able to point out with precision the numerous muscular insertions of which it is the seat. It is not equally thick in its whole extent; the anterior extremity is thick, it is then contracted a little; about two inches behind this extremity it is considerably enlarged; and stUl more posteriorly there is a second enlargement even greater than the former. The inferior border (w x y', fig. 47.) which looks inwards is the shortest; it commences at the most sloping part of the os coxae by a large rough tuberosity, called tuberosity of the ischium x), which gives attachment to almost all the muscles on the back of the thigh ; the weight of the body rests upon it in the sitting posture. Proceeding from this tuberosity towards.the inner part of the os coxae {x y), the lower border becomes flexuous, irregular, and slightly twisted upon itself; it passes obliquely inwards and upwards, and contributes to form the pubic arch (^x y x, fig. 48.), Above this oblique portion the border presents a vertical elliptic surface, which unites with the corresponding surface on the opposite bone, and forms the symphysis pubis (y y', fig. 47, 48.). The lower border of the os coxae consists, therefore, of two portions; an oblique, which foms part of the arch, and a vertical, which forms part of the symphysis. The anterior border (« y',figs. 47, 48.) commences at the anterior extremity 13118 OSTEOLOGY. of the crest of the ilium by an eminence for muscular insertion, which can be always easily felt under the skin; it is the anterior superior spinous process qf the ilium («). Below, is a notch (u u'), which separates this process from another eminence for the insertion of the rectus femoris; it is called anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium («'). Below this last process is a notch or angular groove (ii' n), over which the iliac muscle glides: on this situation the anterior border changes its direction, and from being vertical becomes hori- zontal. The horizontal portion of the anterior border presents then a smooth concave surface inclined forwards, and shaped like a triangle, with the base outwards. This triangular surface, which is covered by the pectineus muscle, presents, 1. an anterior edge (*,fig- 48.), continuous with the anterior lip of the obturator foramen ; 2. a posterior sharp edge, called crest of the pubes (* *,figs. 47 and 48.), a continuation of the horizontal ridge which we have described as forming the lower boundary of the internal iliac fossa ; 3. a base presenting the eminentia ileo-pectinea {n n) which corresponds to the femoral artery, and upon which this vessel should be compressed, care being taken to direct the force obliquely downwards, and backwards, that is, perpendicularly to the surface of the bone ; 4. the summit of the triangle has a sharp eminence, which in emaciated subjects forms a marked projection under the skin. This eminence, called spine of the pubes (o), gives attachment to the rectus abdominis, and must be distinguished from the angle of the pubes (y'), which is a right angle formed by the meeting of the anterior and inferior borders. The posterior border (u w, fig. 48.) of the os coxse commences at the pos- terior extremity of the crest of the ilium by a sharp eminence, named poste- rior and superior spinous process of the ilium (v, figs. 47, 48.) ; below is a notch which separates it from another eminence, the posterior inferior spinous pro- cess of the ilium (u')- Below this is a very large notch, the sciatic notch of the coxa (v z,fig. 47.), which contributes to form the great sciatic notch which we shall notice in the general description of the pelvis. This notch is terminated below by a sharp ridge, called ihe sciatic spine (z) ; as this spine sometmies projects inwards, can it, as some have imagined, press upon the foetal head when it is clearing the lower outlet of the pelvis ? Between this spme and the tuberosity of the ischium (2 w) is a smaU but weU marked groove, over which the tendon of the obturator internus passes. _ Internal structure. Like all broad bones, the haunch bone is composed ot spongy substance contained between two lamina; of compact tissue; at the bottom of the acetabulum, and in the double concavity of the iliac fossa;, it is thin and semi-transparent; it is thick at the circumference, the crest of the ilium, the upper and back part of the acetabulum, the articular portion ot the Dubes, and more particularly at the tuberosity of the ischium. Connections. The os coxse unites with its feUow of the opposite side, with the sacrum, and with the femur. . Development. The os coxa; is developed from three primitive, and fave secondary points of ossification. The three primitive pomts remam distinct until a very advanced period, and therefore both ancient and modem anato- mists have incorrectly described them as separate bones, under the names ot t/l" and plbes. The i/.W (1,^,. 48.) comprehends the i^^per par. of the acetabulum, and the broad cui-ved and triangular sui-face above it. 1 he fJes f2) coiises, 1. the inner part of the acetabulum; 2. the horizontal, CismatiJ anTtriangular column that bounds the obtui-ator foramen above, andTh chls called the body of the pubes (/) ; 3. the vertical descending Wh flattLed in front an^ behind, which bounds tbe same foramen on the In.idP and is called the descending ramus of the pubes {li,figs 47, 48.). -Sllw comprises, 1. the lower part of the acetabulum; o I vertTcal coh^^^ thick, prismatic, and triangular, which forms the 2. a vertical coiumii, vcij t>,P nhtnrator foramen on the outside: this is \"''^rf*^^t^' 'iiTt 47 2d Is ) 3 aTascending branch, sloping ZS, gtitrS^S-blli. wh^ch bounds the foramen below andTHE PELVIS IN GENERAL. 119 I 4 on the inside, and joins the descending ramus of the pubes; this is the as- cending ramus of the ischimn (e, fiy. 48.). The hmits of these three pieces are marked before complete development by three cartilaginous lines united like the letter Y, at the bottom of the cotyloid cavity (see^y. 48.),jvhich is the place where the three primitive osseous points meet, and this fact has comributed, m no small degree, to estabUsh that la^v of osteogony which we noticed in our general remai-ks, viz. that when an articular cavity exists upon the surface of a bone which is developed from several points, these points always unite m ThrfoUowins are the complementary points: 1. one at the bottom of the acetabulum, pointed out by M. Serres* and shaped like the letter Y ; 2. the marqinal epiphysis, which occupies and forms the entire length ot the crest ot the ilium ; 3. the epiphysis of the tuberosity of the ischium, which stretches along the ascending ramus; 4. and 5. two epiphyses, which do not seem constant; one occupies the anterior and inferior spinous process of the ibum, the other, still more rare, occupies the angle of the pubes. , • , • The ossification of the os coxse commences first in the ilium, in the ischium next, and in the pubes last. The osseous germ of the ilium appears on the fiftieth day, that of the ischium at the end of the third month, and that of the pubes at the end of the fifth month. At birth the ossification of the os coxas is not far advanced ; the acetabulum is in a great measure cartilaginous. The ascending ramus of the ischium, the descending ramus of the pubes, and the entire circumference of the ilium, are also cartilaginous. These three pieces are united together from the thirteenth to the fifteenth yeai-. At the same time, the secondary points of ossification appear, and successively unite with the primitive. This union is completed from the tenth to the twentieth year ; the epiphysis of the crest of the iiium alone remains separate until the age of twenty-two, twenty-four or even twenty-five years. The Pelvis in geneeax. The sacrum, the coccyx, and the haunch bones, having now been described, we are enabled to study the bony cavity which they concur in forming. It is called the pelvis (Jig. 48.), and forms for the lower extremities an osseous girdle, analogous to that which the shoulders form for the upper extremities. The pelvis or basin, so named because it has been compared to a vase, is a large, irregular, bony cavity, open above and below, which supports the vertebral column behind, and is itself supported by the thigh bones on the sides and in front. In an adult of ordinary stature the pelvis divides the body into two equal parts. In the foetus the part of the body above the pelvis is much longer than that below; in adults of large stature, on the other hand, the part below is considerably longer than that above. The pelvis is symmetrical but of a very irregular figure ; we may say upon the whole, that it forms a truncated cone, presenting, 1. an upper part or great pelvis, oval transversely, much expanded on each side and notched in front; 2. a sort of contracted canal below this upper part, which is called the little pelvis. When the pelvis is examined in the skeleton, it has not the horizontal position which it presents when resting on the tuberosities of the ischium and the extremity of the coccyx. It is znc/medwith regard to the axis of the body. The obliquity of the pelvis is not the same throughout, and we have therefore to consider two axes, one for the great, and one for the little pelvis. The axis of the great pelvis is directed obliquely downwards and backwards, and is re- * This point of ossification has been regarded as the vestige of a bone peculiar to marsupial animals, and named marsupial bone; but this view is incorrect; for, according to Ciivier this fourth piece is found in marsupials themselves at the bottom of the cotyloid cavity, whereas the a^mls'^' hone is a superadded portion of the skeleton which supports the pouch in these120 OSTEOLOGY. presented by a line passing from the umbilicus, towards the lower part of the curvature of the sacrum ; the axis of the little pelvis, on the contrary, is directed downwards and forwards, and is represented by a line passing from the upper part of the curvature of the sacrum, through the centre of the lower opening or outlet of the pelvis. From the direction of these two axes, it follows that the line of direction of the pelvis is a curve with the concavity forwards, and which is pretty correctly represented by the curvature of the anterior surface of the sacrum. This sort of incurvation of the pelvis is an anatomical fact of the greatest consequence, not only on account of the important office which this part of the skeleton performs in the mechanism of standing, but also because without an acquaintance with it, it is impossible to understand the mechanism of natural labour, the curved canal of the pelvis being the path which the infant has to traverse in passing out of the cavity. The obliquity of-the pelvis varies at different ages and in different in- dividuals : it is pretty exactly measured by the prominence of the sacro-ver- tebral angle. In the infant the pelvis deviates greatly from the horizontal direction; its upper aperture looks almost directly forwards.: in the adult it looks much more upwards; and in the aged it again looks forward, as in the infant, but from a very different cause. In the foetus the superior aperture is turned forwards, even when the body is upright: at this age the obliquity of the pelvis is inherent in its form; but in the aged, the pelvis looks forward, because the trunk is curved in the same direction, and tends towards a horizontal position as in quadrupeds. Thus, in the foetus the pelvis has an obliquity which depends on form; in the aged the obliquity depends upon attitude. The human pelvis is much larger than that of any other animal; and this larger size is connected with the important office it performs in maintaining the erect posture of the trunk. There is no part of the skeleton, the form and dimensions of which so readily discriminate the sex of the individual; in the male the height predomi- nates ; in the female, the breadth. By comparing the distance between the crests and the anterior and the posterior spinous processes of the ilia, and between the obturator foramina, in the two sexes, we find that the transverse dimensions are much greater in the female ; the same is observed in the antero-posterior di- mensions, which may be easily proved by measuring the distance between the symphysis pubis, and the sacro-vertebral angle, and the distance between each obturator foramen and the sacro-iliac symphysis on the opposite side. We should add, that in the female, 1. the iliac fossse are larger, and turned more outwards than in the male; hence the prominence of the hips; 2. the crest of the iUum is not so much twisted in form of the itaUc S; 3. the interval between the symphysis pubis and the acetabulum is greater; this is partly the cause of the OTeat prominence of the trochanters, and the separation of the femora, which lives the female a peculiar gait in walking; 4. the superior strait or brim is wider in every direction ; 5. the tuberosities of the ischia are more separated, and the symphysis pubis is not so deep; 6. the obturator foramen is triangular; 7 the arch of the pubis is rounded, wider, and more curved, while in the male it is triangular and narrower; 8. the inner edges of the ascending rami of the ischia are prominent, and look less directly downwards than m the male. Such are the differences of the pelvis as regards sex; we see that for the most nart they may be comprehended in the foUowmg proposition : — The female pelvis exceeds the male in its horizontal diameters; the viale pelvis exceeds the female in its vertical diameters. Regions of the Pelvis, TTndpr this title we shall examine in succession the external and internal suSace of £ pelvis the upper circumference or base, and the lower circum- ference or summit.121 THE PELVIS IN GENERAL. The exlernat surface of the pelvis must be examined in front, behind, and °°*^!£So. region. 1. In the median line we observe the symphysis pubis (t/y, fig. 48). varying irom lit- teen to eighteen or twenty lines in length, always longer in the male, and resembling a vertical column. It is obliquely directed downwards and backwards, which direction is peculiar to man ; in all other animals, as Cnvier has remarked, it is placed horizontally. 2. On each side we find the descending ramus of the pubes (k), which is irregularly quadrilateral, and gives attachment to several mus- cles. 3. Outside the pubic column there is, on each side, the obtu- rator foramen (h). , ., ^ ^i. ■ Posterior region. On this we observe, 1. the ridge of the sacrum in the median Une; 2. and on each side the sacral grooves, which are much deepened above, because the back part of the ilium projects behind the sacrum: we find here, also, two ranges of eminences, corresponding to the articular and trans- verse processes, and likewise the back of the sacro-iliac articulation. Each lateral region is formed by the external iliac fossa, the acetabu- lum, and a considerable portion of the body of the ischium below this cavity. The internal surface of the pelvis is divided into two parts; an upper, which is much expanded, and constitutes the great or false pelvis, and a lower, more contracted, named the small or true pelvis. These two portions of the same cavity are separated by a circular prominence, formed in a great measure by the horizontal ridge (m n o), which we have described as constituting the lower boundary of the internal iliac fossee. The whole space circumscribed by this line has been named the brim, superior orifice, or superior strait of the pelvis. The great pelvis presents, 1. in front, an extensive notch (wy' u) ; 2. behind, the sacro-vertebral angle or promontory of the sacrum (below c?) ; 3. and on the sides, the internal iliac fossse (1 and t), which form an inclined plane on each side, fitted to direct the weight of the viscera which rest upon them, inwards and forwards. The small pelvis is a cavity the apertures of which are contracted, and there- fore named straits, and the middle portion is expanded, and called excavation. We shall, therefore, examine separately its superior opening or upper strait, its inferior opening or lower strait, and its middle portion or excavation. The superior strait or brim is irregularly circular, and has been compared to an oval, an ellipse, or a curvUinear triangle ; but none of these descriptions can give any correct idea of its shape. The circumference, commencing behind, at the articulation between the sacrum and the fifth lumbar vertebra, is formed by the projection of the anterior edge {g d) of the base of the sacrum, by the horizontal ridge (m n), on the inner surface of the iliac bones, by the pectineal line (n a), and terminates in the spine of the pubes. (o) The superior strait has four diameters; an antero-posterior, a transverse, and two oblique. The antero- posterior or sacro-pubic diameter { dy' ) is generally four inches La length ; the transverse (m m), which is the longest, is five inches ; and the two oblique(n g), which are measured from the eminentia ilio-pectinea on one side, to the sacro- iliac symphysis on the other, are four inches and a half These measures are taken from a well-formed female pelvis, and it is chiefly in the female Uiat they are important, on account of their reference to the process of parturition. In the male, all the diameter? of the upper strait are smaller.OSTEOLOGY. 122 The inferior or perineal strait, inferior orifice or outlet of the small pelvis, presents three deep notches separated by three eminences, so that when the pelvis is placed upon a horizontal plane, it appears to rest as it were upon three feet. Of these notches one is anterior, viz. the arch of the pubes (xyx); the others are lateral and somewhat posterior, they are the ischiatic notches {v' z, fig. 47.). The arch of the pubes is angular in the male, but rounded in the fe- male, forming a true arch which receives the occipital bone of the foetus in the great majority of labours; it is formed on each side by the ascending ramus of the ischium, the edge of which is somewhat everted, so that the head of the foetus when passing under the arch glides over a sort of inclined plane, instead of being in contact with the edge of the bone. The transverse diameter of the pubic arch near the upper part has been calculated at one inch; that of the lower part x,fig. 48.) at three inches. The two lateral notches are formed behind by the sacrum and the coccyx ; in front, by the sciatic notch of the os innominatum; they are therefore called also the sacro-sciatic notches. They are very deep, and reach almost to the superior strait of the small pelvis. Of the three eminences which separate the notches, the posterior is formed by the coccyx, and the two anterior by the tuberosities of the ischia, which are situated on a lower plane than the first; from this peculiar arrangement, the whoje weight of the body, in the sitting posture, rests upon the tuberosities of the ischia, and not at aU upon the point of the coccyx. The diameters of the lower aperture of the pelvis are, in reference to parturition, of equal impor- tance with those of the upper, and have been accurately determined. The antero-posterior diameter, or cocci-pubic, so called because it extends from the symphysis pubis to the point of the coccyx, is four inches, but may be increased to four inches and a half by depression of the coccyx. The transverse or hisciatic diameter, which stretches between the tuberosities of the ischia, is four inches, which is invariable; and lastly, the two oblique diameters, which extend from the middle of the sacro-sciatic ligament on one side to the tuber- ositv of the ischium on the other, are also four inches each. These dimen- sions, which are taken from a well-formed female pelvis, are greater than in the male. Excavation. The excavation or cavity of the true pelvis is formed, 1. Behind, by the sacrum and coccyx, the concavity of which varies in different indivi- duals, but is generally shallower in the female than in the male. The height of these two bones is four inches and a half; the greatest depth of their concavity from ten to twelve lines. 2. In front, by the symphysis and back part of the pubes, forming a plane inclined downwards and backwards ; outside the pubes is the'inner opening of the obturator foramen. 3. On the sides, the excavation is formed by two smooth planes inclined downwards and inwards; they are about three inches and a half in height, and are bounded behind by the sciatic ^°It is of great consequence to notice these two inclined planes, because they perform an important part in the mechanism of parturition. The diameters of the excavation being of little value in an anatomical point of view, the stu- dent is referred to works on midwifery for an account of them. The superior circumference or base of the pelvis looks forwards, and is formed behind by the sacro-vertebral angle; on each side by the upper border of the ilium and in front by the anterior border of the same bone. It presents, 1. m front'a vast notch (« u, fig. 48.), in which we observe in the median line the upper liquely upwards and outwards, to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium («), where it terminates j 2. behind, the great circumference of the pelvis presents the sacro-vertebral angle, and on each side a small notch between the vertebral column and the back of the crest of the ilium ; 3. lateraUy, we ob-THE FEMUE. 123 serve the crest of the ilium (« «), bent much more outwards in the female than ""The^dimensions of the upper circumference of the pelvis, measured in a ..eU-formed female, are the foUowing: 1. between the anterior superior spmes of the ilia from eight to nine inches ; 2. from the middle of the crest of one ilium to that of the other, from nine to ten inches. x,- v i,„„ The w/erior circumference of the pelvis forms the lower strait which has been already described. General Development of the Pelvis. The pelvis in the first periods of life participates in the slow development of the lower extremities. Its dimensions, especially in the foetus and in infancy, are so small, that it is unable to receive into its cavity many of the organs which are afterwards contained in it; this is one of the principal causes of the prominence of the abdomen of the foetus. The smaller capacity of the pelvis results also from the absence of the iliac fossa), for these bones are neither twisted nor excavated, but straight and flat. Nevertheless, the upper or ibac portion is proportionally more developed than the lower or cotyloid, doubtless because this latter part belongs especially to the lower extremities, and also serves as a protection to the genital organs, both of which are in a rudimentary state in the foetus. If we examine in detail the differences in size, considered only with reference to the various diameters, we shall find that the transverse are vei7 small, because in front the cotyloid cavities are scarcely developed, and aU the pubic region is contracted; and behind, the Uiac bones are more closely approximated to each other on account of the small size of the sacrum. The antero-posterior diameters appear longer on account of the shortness of the transverse. But the most characteristic feature of the pelvis, in the early periods of life, is its much greater inclination than in the adult. In the latter, indeed, a horizontal line drawn from the upper part of the- symphysis pubis would fall only a few Unes below the base of the sacrum, while in the foetus a similar horizontal line would fall nearer the lower than the upper part of the sacrum. This, as well as the small capacity of the pelvis, is the cause of the forward position of the bladder, bringing the whole of its anterior surface to correspond with the parietes of the abdomen, and consequently rendering it more easily accessible to instruments introduced above the pubes. We have already remarked, that the obliquity of the pelvis in the aged, is not of the same kiud as that in the foetus; and we should add here, that there is no change in the relative position of the bladder, which, as in the adult, corresponds to the back of the os pubis. The Thigh. The Femur {Jigs. 49 and 50.). The femur, or thigh bone, situated between the pelvis and the leg, is the longest and largest bone of the skeleton. It is proportionally larger in man than in any other animal; this is connected with the ofiice which it performs, of supporting by itself alone the weight of the body in standing, and trans- mitting it to the leg. It is obliquely directed downwards and inwards. This obliquity is greater in the female than in the male, on account of the greater distance between the acetabula. Too great an obliquity is injurious both in standing and walking, and constitutes a well known deformity. The femur describes a curve in front and behind, the convexity of which looks forward, and leaves a sort of excavation behind, which is occupied by the numerous powerful muscles which bend the leg upon the thigh. Indepen- dently of this antero-posterior curvature, the femur is slightly twisted upon Itself. This curvature of torsion seems to me to be connected with the course of the femoral artery, which passes round the shaft of the bone from one sur- face to the other. Lastly, at its upper part it presents an angular curve which we shall notice presently.124 OSTEOLOGY. Like all other long bones the femur is divided into a body and extremities. Of the body. The body or shaft is prismatic and triangular, with three sur- faces and three edges. The anterior surface (a, fig. 50.) is rounded and has a cylindrical aspect: it is broader below than above. The internal surface (b,fig. 49.) is flat, it becomes much wider below, and then looks backwards. The femoral artery corresponds to this surface, and may be compressed upon it towards the middle third of the thigh. The external surface (c) is much narrower than the internal, and is slightly excavated throughout its extent. Of the three edges, the internal and the external are rounded, and scarcely dis- tinguishable from the surfaces k J}^^^ /»=v which they separate. The pos- terior edge (e df), on the con- trary, is very rough and promi- nent, and has therefore been called the linea aspera: it is divided into two lips and an interspace, for the sake of faci- litating the description of the numerous muscles to which it gives attachment. It is more rough above than below, and is bifurcated at both ends. Of the two branches of the upper bi- furcation, the external (e), ex- tremely rough, is occasionally surmounted by a considerable eminence, and prolonged to the large process called great tro- chanter. The internal branch is less projecting, and terminates on the inside in a smaller emi- nence called lesser trochanter. The outer branch (/) of the lower bifurcation runs towards the outside of the lower extre^ mity of the femur, and termi- nates in an eminence, below which is a small depression to which the external head of the gastro-cnemius is attached. The inner branch (o) is nearly effaced at the part where the femoral artery passes over it: below this it appears again, and Uke the outer branch tenmnates fn a weU-marked prominence, to which the adductor magnus is attached^ and beloJit, the inner head of the gastro-cnemiu.. The tnan^ar mterva^ m- cludld between the two branches of the bifurcation, corresponds to tie pophteal Sery and vein. The nutritious foramen (A) is situated m the hnea aspera; it ^'I^Z'lZSI'l^Xoi the femur forms an obtuse angle with the body an?

The upper edge is ^ery sbort Seen these two, by a projecting ridge which unites them, and which is caUed the mter-trochanteric line. . , fomnv The great trochanter (m) is situated at the outer ajid upper part of the temm . ■ It is on a lower level than the head, and nearly in the same axis as the shalt which it prolongs upwards. It is of considerable size, and forms a very marked prominence under the skin. It should be carefully studied m its re- lations ; 1. with the crest of the iUum, beyond which it projects on the outside; 2 with the external condyle of the femur; 3. with the external malleolus, be- cause these relations constantly serve as a guide, both mthe diagnosis, and the reduction of dislocations of the femur, and of fractures of the neck or shaft of that bone. The great trochanter, which is intended solely for muscular insertions, is of a quadrUateral figure, flattened from without inwards, and presents, 1. an external surface, which is convex, and terminates below m a proiectmg ridge for the vastus extemus, and is traversed by an oblique line running downwards and backwards, to which the gluteus medius is attached ; 2. an internal surface, on which we find a depression called digital, or trochan- teric cavity; 3. a superior border, to which the gluteus minimus is attached ; 4. an anterior border, which is often surmounted by a large tubercle; and 5. a posterior border, which gives attachment to the quadratus femoris. The lesser trochanter (w) is situated on the inside, behind, and below the base of the neck of the femur ; it is a sort of conoid tubercle, and gives attachment to the common tendon of the psoas and iliacus muscles. The lower end of the shaft of the femur is of considerable size : it is broad, transversely flattened in front and behind, and divided into two convex arti- cular processes, called internal (r) and external (s) condyles of the femur. The external condyle is in the same line as the shaft of the femur. The internal condyle projects on the inside of the axis of the bone, and below the external condyle, so that when both condyles rest on the same horizontal plane, the femur is directed obliquely downwards and inwards. The two condyles are separated behind by a deep notch, called inter-condyloid notch {o,fig. 49.) ; in front their union forms a sort of pulley, the femoral trochlea (t,fig. 50.), on which the patella rests. That portion of the trochlea which belongs to the external condyle is larger, more prominent, and higher than that which belongs to the internal. Each condyle has three surfaces, 1. the lower surface, arti- cular, convex, and rounder behind than in front, is in contact with the tibia and the patella ; the lower surface of the internal condyle is more prominent behind than that of the external: 2. the internal surface of the external con- dyle, and the external surface of the internal condyle are deeply excavated, and give insertion to the crucial ligaments : 3. the internal surface of the in- ternal condyle and the external surface of the external condyle present two enlargements, called tuberosities of the femur. The internal tuberosity (u) is the larger, and has behind a depression situatedOSTEOLOGY. 126 above the tubercle for the adductor magnus, already described. The external tuberosity (w) is less prominent, and presents two depressions separated by a tubercle, which may be easily felt under the skin in emaciated subjects. Connections. The femur articulates with the innominatum, which transmits to it the weight of the body, and with the tibia upon which it rests, and is in contact with the patella. Internal structure. Like all long bones, the femur is compact in its shaft and spongy at the extremities; its medullary canal is the type of canals of that kind. Development. The femur is developed from five points; of these three are primitive, viz. one for the shaft, and one for each extremity; two are epiphysary, one being for each trochanter. A bony point first appears in the shaft, from the thirtieth to the fortieth day; the osseous germ of the lower extremity is visible in the centre of the cartilage, during the last fifteen days of foetal life. The constancy of the appearance of this point is of great importance in forensic medicine, because its existence proves at once that the foetus has reached the full term. The third point is seen in the head of the femur, at the end of the first year after birth. The neck has no separate osseous centre; it is formed by an extension of the shaft. The nodule of the great trochanter is developed from three to four years after birth; that of the lesser trochanter, from the thirteenth to the fourteenth year. The order of union of these parts does not coincide with that of their ap- pearance ; it commences after puberty, and does not terminate until after the growth of the body is completed. The lesser trochanter, the great trochanter, and the head, are successively attached to the bone about the eighteenth year. The lower extremity, which appeared first, does not join the shaft until the twentieth year. The Patella (^Jig. 5\.). The patella or rotMla, so named from its rounded shape, resembling a wheel, is, both from its size, and the functions which it performs, the most important of those bones, which have been called sesamoid (from a-ri<Tiifj,ri), on account of their resemblance to the sesamum seed, and which are found in the neighbour- hood of various articulations that are subjected to much pressure. It is situated in front of the knee, and is moveable when the leg is extended; but fixed and veiy prominent when the leg is flexed upon the thigh. It is the most variable of all the bones, both in its absolute size, and in the proportion of its different dimensions. It is flattened in front and behind, and presents an anterior and a posterior surface, and a circumference. The anterior or subcutaneous surface (,l,fg. 51.) is convex, and covered by a very thick layer of fibrous tissue, intimately adherent to the bone. The posterior or femoral surface (2, Jig. 51.) corresponds exactly to the pulley on the lower extremity of the femur. We observe on it, 1. an articular ridge (a:) sloping downwards and inwards, and corresponding to the groove of the trochlea, which presents the same obliquity; 2. on each side of this ridge d concave articular surface, which is moulded upon the corresponding condyle of the femur ; and as the external condyle of the femur is the larger, the ex- ternal articular surface (y) of the patella is much greater than the internal. From this inequality, it is easy at once to distinguish the right from the left pateUa, ^ ... The circumference oi the patella resembles a curvilinear triangle; its thick base, directed upwards, gives attachment to the tendon ot the extensor muscles of the leg; and its apex (z) turned downwards, and somewhat pointed, gives attachment to the ligamentum patellae. Its sides are thin, and give attachment to some aponeurotic fibres; so that, excepting its posterior surface, which is articular, the whole patella is enveloped in fibrous tissue, a circumstance which is in accordance with its peculiar mode of development, and has an important influence over its reunion when fractured.127 THE TIBIA. Internal structure. The patella is entirely composed of spongy tissue, covered in front by a thin layer of compact substance, which forms a very remarkable exception to the generality of short bones, in presenting well-marked parallel vertical fibres. Between these fibres are numerous vascular openings. Development. The patella is developed from one point only. In a few rare cases, as Rudolphi has observed, there are several points. The ossification of the patella commences about the age of two years and a half. The Leg, The Tibia {fig. 52.). The tibia, the larger of the two bones of the leg, is situated between the femur, which rests upon its upper end, and the foot on which it is supported. Next to the femur, it is the largest and longest bone of the skeleton. Its upper extremity is expanded, the shaft is narrower and of a triangular pris- matic form. The lower extremity is also expanded, but to a much less degree than the uppei-. The smallest part of the tibia does not exactly correspond with the middle of the shaft as in the femur, but at the junction of the lower with the two upper thirds and in this place fractures, produced by contre- coup, are most frequent. The direction of the tibia is vertical, contrasting thus with the femur, which, as we have seen, slants obliquely downwards and inwards. In individuals whose thigh bones are very oblique, the tibiaj have a du-ection downwards and outwards. In a well-formed skeleton the two tibiae are pai-aUel. With regard to its axis, the tibia presents a double inflexion, so that the upper end is turned outwards and the lower slightly inwards. When this last inclination is excessive it gives rise to bowed legs. Lastly, it is slightly twisted at its lower part. Like all long bones it is divided into a body and extremities. The boay or shaft has the figure of a triangular prism ; and this form, which is observed in almost all long bones, is in none so marked as in the tibia. We have therefore to consider three surfaces and three edges. The internal surface (a, fig. 53.) is covered at the upper part by an aponeu- Fig.hi. Fig. 53. rotic expansion (called patte d'oie*, or goose's foot') : in the rest of its extent it is immediately under the skin. This superficial situation of the internal surface partly explains the facility with which this bone may be broken by direct violence, and also the frequency of caries, exostoses, and ne- crosis. It is broad above, and gradually diminishes towards the lower part. Its three superior fourths look inwards and forwards ; its lower fourth looks directly inwards. The external surface (6) presents in a great part of its extent, but especially above, a longitudinal excavation, the depth of which corresponds to the size of the tibialis anticus, to which it gives attachment. Inferiorly, the external surface of the tibia turns forwards ((f), and this deviation corre- sponds with the altered direction of several tendons, which are placed at first on the outside of the bone, and afterwards pass in front of it. There is in fact a constant reciprocity between alterations in the direction of bones, and changes in the course of neighboui'ing tendons. The posterior sujface is also broad above, and progress- ively diminishes downwards. On it we observe near the upper part, 1. An irregular line, running obliquely down- wards and inwards ; to this line many of the deep-seated muscles on the back of the leg are attached. 2. Above this line a triangular surface covered by the popliteus muscle which separates it from the popliteal artery. 3. Below the same line, the orifice of the nutritious canal which runs and semil l'ZCLos^^^Zt::.f °f 'he sartorius, gracilis128 OSTEOLOGY. downwards. Into this nutritious canal, which is perhaps the largest of any in the long bones, I have seen a nervous twig enter, accompanying the nutritious artery. 4. From the oblique line to the lower end of the tibia, the posterior surface of this bone is smooth, of almost uniform diameter, and divided through- out its length by a more or less marked vertical line. The anterior edge (c c) is placed immediately under the skin, beneath which It may be readily felt *: its lower fourth is round and blunt, the upper three fourths are sharp, and hence it has been called the crest of tJie tibia. Its upper part inclines somewhat outwards, its lower part inwards. The external edge (g k) gives attachment to the interosseous ligament; it is bifurcated below, and thus forms the two boundaries of an airticular cavity which we shall notice in describing the lower end of the tibia. The internal border (ft), much less sharp than the others, afifordB insertion to several muscles. The upper or femoral extremity {f g) of the tibia is at least double the size of the lower, and is larger in a transverse direction than from before backwards; on it we observe two concave articular surfaces, of an oval shape, with their long diameter directed from behind forwards. They have been improperly denominated condyles; a more correct name would be glenoid cavities of the tibia. These surfaces, which articulate with the condyles of the femur, are not per- fectly alike; the internal is longer, narrower, and deeper than the external. They are separated by a pyramidal eminence surmounted by two sharp tu- bercles. This eminence, which is called the spine of the tibia (e), is nearer the posterior than the anterior part of the bone. In front and behind this spine are two rough depressions, which give attachment to the crucial ligaments. The glenoid cavities are supported by two considerable enlargements, called tuberosities of the tibia. . The internal tuberosity (/), larger than the external, presents behmd a hori- zontal groove, into which one of the divisions of the tendon of the semi-mem- branosus is inserted. The external tuberosity (g) presents at its back part a small almost circular facette, which articulates with a correspondmg surface on the fibula. The two tuberosities of the tibia are separated behind by a consi- derable excavation. In front they are separated by a triangular surface, pierced by vascular foramina, and terminating below in an eminence, called an<enor tuberosit,/ of the tibia (A). This tuberosity, below which the crest of the bone commences, is rough and prominent below, where it gives attachment to the tendon of the extensor muscles of the leg, ligamentum patelttB; and smootn above where it is separated from the same tendon by a synovial bursa. A pro- iecting line runs outwards from this tuberosity, and termmates above in a tubercle, which is very prominent in some individuals, and may be easily lelt under the skin. It gives origin to part of the tibiaUs anticus. The lower or tarsal extremity (I k) of the tibia is almost square, having, hke the upper, its greatest diameter transversely. We observe on it a quadrilateral articX cavity (0, transversely oblong, broader on the outside than on the L drLd di^ded by an antero-posterior ridge, into two unequal parts. It S cuiates with the astragalus.

This eminence, which bends inwards, forms a marked prominence at the lower and inner part of the tibia. When the posterior sur- face of the tibia is laid upon a horizontal plane, the two tuberosities of the upper end of the bone rest upon that plane, while the internal malleolus ad- vances considerably forwards; it is therefore upon a plane anterior to that of internal tuberosity of the tibia; this depends upon the torsion of the lower part of the bone. The internal siirface {1} of the malleolus is convex, and is placed immediately under the skin j its external surface forms part of the in ferior articular- cavity of the tibia. Its anterior edge is rough, and gives at- tachment to ligamentous fibres ; its posterior edge, which is thicker than the anterior, presents a groove running obliquely downwards and inwards, and sometimes double, along which the tendons of the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digitorimi pass. The base of the malleolus is united to the shaft of the bone. The summit, which is truncated and slightly notched, gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the ankle joint. Connections. The tibia articulates with the femur, the astragalus, and the fibula ; it articulates also with the patella, but indirectly by means of the liga- mentum patellae. Internal structure. The shaft consists of compact tissue, and has a large medullary canal. The two extremities are spongy, and are pierced by a great number of vascular foramina. Development. The tibia is developed fro^ three points; one for the body, and two for the extremities. Sometimes there are fom\ Beclard once saw the internal malleolus developed from a separate point. The ossific point of the shaft is the first to make its appearance; it commences between the thirty- fifth and fortieth day, almost at the same time as that of the body of the femur; sometimes it is even earlier, as in one case observed by myself. The bony germ of the upper extremity makes its appearance generally towards the end of the first year after birth. I have never seen it before birth. The ossifi- cation of the lower extremity commences during the second year. The in- ternal malleolus is formed by a prolongation of this extremity. The union of all the parts of the bone is not finished until the period of complete deve- lopment of the body, that is, from the eighteenth to the twenty-fifth year ; it always commences with the lower extremity, which is the last to become bony. It is of importance to remark, that the superior epiphysis of the tibia does not form the whole of the upper end of the bone, but only a sort of ho- rizontal plate which supports the articular cavities; and the same is true of almost all articular extremities. It should also be observed, that the anterior tuberosity of the tibia is formed by a vertical prolongation of the plate which forms the superior epiphysis. It would appear, that in some subjects this an- terior tuberosity has a distinct centre of development. The Fibula {fig. 53.). The fibula or perone (from trepSvn') is so named because, according to Sa- batier, it has been compared to a sort of clasp or brace, in use among the ancients. _ In order to understand the description of this bone, it is necessary to place It exactly in the position which it occupies in the skeleton.* It is situated on the outside of the tibia below, on the outside and to the back of the same bone above.

It is the most twisted of all the long bones, and is a remarkable exem- plification of that law of osteology, viz. that the torsion of bones is always con- nected with changes of direction of tendons, or vessels. It is divided into a body and two extremities. The body has the form of a triangular prism. In order rightly to compre- hend its shape, it is necessary to be aware that the muscles which are placed on its external surface above, turn round to the posterior aspect below, from which it is easy to understand how the four upper fifths of the external surface look outwards, and the lower fifth backwards. The external surface (n) is marked by a deep groove which runs along it, and gives attachment to the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis. The lower part, which is turned backwards, is smooth. The internal surface is divided into two unequal parts by a longitudinal ridge, to which the interosseous ligament is attached. The portion of the surface in front of the ridge is narrower than the other, being in some subjects not more than two lines in breadth ; it gives attachment to the muscles on the fore part of the leg ; the portion behind the ridge is larger, and gives attachment to the tibialis posticus. This surface be- comes anterior at its lower part (o). The posterior surface of the fibula is narrow above, and expanded below, where it looks inwards, and terminates by a rough part, to which ligaments that unite it to the tibia are attached. The whole of this surface gives attach- ment to muscles. We observe on it the principal nutritious canal, which passes obliquely downwards. This canal is sometimes placed on the internal surface of the bone. . . m, . The three edges participate in the deviations of the surfaces. 1 hus the outer edge (r) becomes posterior below; the anterior edge (s) becomes external, and is bifurcated ; the internal edge becomes anterior, and after being thus changed forms the continuation of the ridge for the interosseous hgament, which we noticed upon the inner surface. , vi ^ • All the edges give attachment to muscles, and are remarkable for their ^'^ThTsuSrior extremity or head («) of the fibula presents an articular facette (■near 0 slightly concave, which unites with a corresponding surface on the tibia: on the outside are some irregular impressions for the insertion of the biceps muscle, and the external lateral ligament of the knee At the back part of this head we observe the styloid process of the fibula (below 0 for the tendon of the biceps. , ■. i ^x. • c The lower extremity or external malleolus (« v) passes much below the mfe- rior articular surface of the tibia; it is longer and thicker than the mternal maUeolus.

The extremities are united to the shaft of the bone when the deyelopmen is completed, viz. from twenty to twenty-five years the lower end is the first to become joined. The Foot (Jigs. 54, 55, and 56.). The foot is the part of the lower extremity which is analogous to the hand in the upper. They are both but varieties of the same type of organisation, with certain differences which have reference to their respective uses. In the foot, for example, which is intended to support the body, the conditions neces- sary for soUdity are principally manifest, whUe the hand is chiefly remarkable for the mobility of its parts. . , , , ■ • r The foot is composed of twenty-six bones, which, by their union, form three distinct parts, viz. 1. the tarsus (c ij, fig. 54.), a bony mass consisting of seven pieces closely articulated; 2. the metatarsus, composed of five separate columns (m m.', figs. 54 and 55.) ; and 3. the toes, formed each of three columns (re o r), excepting the first, or most internal, which has only two (re' r'). The size of the foot varies in dif- ferent individuals. It exceeds the hand in thickness and length, but is not so broad. Its direction is horizontal from before backwards, and it forms a right angle with the leg, differing much in this respect from the hand, which is in the same line as the forearm. It is flattened from above downwards, is hollow below {fig. 56.), narrow behind, where it is of considerable height, and thinner and broader in front, at which part also it is digitated. It presents, 1. a superior or dorsal surface, which is convex, dorsum pedis (fig. 54.); 2. an inferior or plantar surface, which is concave transversely, and likewise in the antero-posterior direction, sole of the foot (fig. 55.) ; 3. an internal or tibial edge (fig. 56.), which is very thick, and corresponds to the great toe : 4. an external or fibular edge, which corresponds to the little toe ; 5. a posterior ex tremity or heel; 6. an anterior or digital extremity. We shall describe in succession the tarsus, the metatarsus, and the toes. Tlie Tarsus {figs. 54, 55, and 56.). The tarsus is an analogous structure to the carpus, but differs from it in forming the posterior half of the foot, while the carpus only constitutes about a sixth of the hand. Its antero-posterior dia- meter surpasses by more than double its transverse, precisely the opposite of what obtains m the carpus. It resembles a vaulted arch, the convexity of which (c aj, fig. 56.) looks upwards, and which is excavated below (d i) both transversely ajid from before backwards. The weight of the leg falls upon the summit of this arch. This form of the foot is not designed merely for securing the ad- K 2OSTEOLOGY. 132 vantages derived from the mechanism of arches, but is especially intended to afford a protecting excavation for the organs which could not with impunity he compressed in standing and progression. The posterior and free extremity of the tarsus is narrow, and progressively enlarges forwards. The tarsus is composed of seven bones, disposed in two rows. The first or tibial row is formed by two bones only, the os calcis (c), and the astragalus (a); the second or metatarsal row consists of five bones, viz. the scaphoid (g), the cuboid (/), and the three cuneiform bones {i j I). The bones of the first row, instead of being placed in the same transverse line like those of the first row of the carpus, rest one upon the other. The astragalus is the only bone of the tarsus which enters into the formation of the ankle joint. First or Tibial Row of the Tarsus. The Astragalus (a). The astragalus is placed below the tibia, above the os calcis, on the inside of the malleolar extremity of the fibula, and behind the scaphoid ; it is irregularly cuboid in its figure, is the second largest bone of the tarsus, and has six sur- faces. 1. The superior or tibial surface (a, fig. 54.) is articular, and shaped hke a trochlea or puUey, which fits exactly to the lower surface of the tibia. In front and behind the trochlea, are inequalities for the attachment of hgaments. 2. The inferior or calcaneal surface {a, fig. 55.) presents two facettes, separated bv a verv deep furrow running obliquely backwards and mwards, and broadest in front which gives insertion to a ligament. The facette behind the groove is the larger; it is concave and oblong in the same direction as the groove. The facette in front is flat, and often divided into two smaller surfaces Both articulate with the os calcis. 3. The internal lateral surface {fig. 56.) is ar- ticular for a considerable portion of its upper part, and corresponds to the m- ternal malleolus ; below, there is a rough depression, which gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the ankle joint. 4. The external lateral mr- faceis triangular, like the corresponding smface of the external malleolus with ihich it articulates. It should be remarked that both the lateral articular sur- faces of the astragalus are continuous with the trochlea, or upper surface, ^ith- out interruption. 5. The anterior or scaphoid surface is convex and has been caUed the head of the astragalus; it is articular, and '^o'^?^^^!"^^^'*?,^;^ anterior facette of the lower surface of the bone already described This he^ is supported by a contracted portion, ornec^ ( b,fig. 54 and 56.), to which lig<i- ment's'areTtta'ched. 6.

The whole of the non-articular portion of this surface projects be- hind the astragalus ; it is flattened on the sides, and slightly concave from be- fore backwards. Its length varies in different individuals, and is the cause of the varieties in the projection of the heel. 2. The lower or plantar surface {fig. 55.) is rather an edge than a true surface ; it is directed obliquely up- wards and forwards. We observe here, at the back part, two tuberosities, the internal of which is much larger than the external; both serve as places of insertion for muscles, but their principal use is to support the weight of the body behind, and they essen«jaHy constitute the heel {d,fig. 56.) in the human subject. 3. The external surface is superficial, which "accounts for the fre- quency of injuries of this bone on its outside, and explains also the possibility of reaching it with surgical instruments. It is convex, and narrow in front, where it presents two superficial grooves separated by a tubercle (s, figs. 54 and 55.). These grooves afford a passage to the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis. On the anterior and superior part of this surface we find also another tubercle, which is a guide to the surgeon in the partial amputa- tion of the foot, recommended by Chopart. 4. The internal surface {fig. 56.) is deeply grooved for the passage of several tendons, and also for the nerves and vessels which are distributed to the sole of the foot. It presents in front and above a projecting eminence, like a blunt hook, in a shallow groove, below which the tendon of the flexor longus poUicis pedis glides. This emi- nence has been called the small process of the os calcis (e, fig. 56.), also susten- tacidum tali, because the anterior and internal articular surface, which supports the astragalus, is on its upper pai-t. 5. The anterior or cuboid surface is the smallest. It is concave from above downwards, and articulates with the cu- boid. It is surmounted on the inside by a short projection, directed horizon- tally forwards*, above which the third articular surface for the astragalus is situated when it exists. The whole portion of the os calcis which supports the anterior or cuboid surface bears the name of great process of the os calcis {t,figs. 54 and 55.). 6. The posterior surface is shaped like a triangle, with the base downwards; its lower part is rough and irregular, and gives attachment to the tendo AchiUis, the upper part, over which the same tendon glides, being smooth and polished like ivory Second Row of the Tarsus. The bones of the second row are five in number ; on the outside it is formed by the cuboid alone, but on the inside it is subdivided into two secondary rows; a posterior, formed by the scaphoid, and an anterior, composed of the three cuneiform bones. This subdivision of the inner portion of the tarsus, by multiplying the articulations, has the effect of diminishing the violence of shocks, or of pressure upon the foot, especially on the inner side. Tlie Cuboid Bone (/, Jigs:. 5^ and 55.). The cuboid which ranks as the third bone of the tarsus in point of size, is situated at the outside of the foot, and appears like a continuation of the great process of the os calcis. It is more regularly cuboid than any of the other tarsal bones, and has six surfaces. 1. The upper or dorsal surface {fig. 54.) is covered by the extensor brevis digitorum pedis, and looks somewhat outwards. ^- Ihe lower or plantar surface {fig. 55.) presents on its fore part a deep groove (/), running obliquely inwards and forwards, for the tendon of the peroneus longus. Behind this groove, the posterior lip of which is very pro- minent, are impressions for the ligament which connects the cuboid and the os contJi rt1.H'i?M.'

The posterior or calcaneal surface is sinuous, directed obliquely inwards and backwards, and adapted to the os calcis in such a way that there is a mutual reception of the surfaces of the two bones. At the inside of this surface, we observe a process which is directed inwards and backwards, and strengthens the union with the os calcis. It occasionally becomes an ob- stacle to the disarticulation of the foot after Chopart's method. 4. The anterior or metatarsal surface looks obliquely inwards and forwards; it articulates with the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. 5. The inter7ial surface articulates with the third cuneiform bone, and frequently also with the scaphoid. It presents, besides, some impressions for the insertion of ligaments. 6. Ine external surface is rather an edge; its extent from before backwards scarcely equals half the length of the internal surface. We observe on it the commence- ment of the groove for the tendon of the peroneus longus. TTie Scaphoid ig,figs. 54, 55, and 56.). The scaphoid or navicular bone, so named from its supposed resemblance to a boat, is situated on the inner side of the tarsus ; it is flattened fro«i l^efo^e backwards, and is thicker above than below, irregularly elliptical, with the long diameter placed transversely. It has two surfaces, and a circumference. 1. The posterior surface is concave, and receives, though incompletely, the head of the astragalus. 2. The anterior surface presents three articular fa- cettes, which conlspond to the three cuneifonn bones. 3. The czrcumference is convex above, inclined inwards, and rough for ligamentous insertions I is much smaller below, where also it gives attachment to hgaments. Onthe inside it presents at its lower part a large process, process of which may be easUy felt under the skin, and serves as a g^^^ m pf/°™"f rhnnirt's amnutation.

This last por- tion completes the kind of recess or mortise mto which the head of the second metatarsal bone is receivedits inner side being formed by the first cune J'orm bone and the bottom by the second. The external surface articulates with the cuboid • the posterior surface is continuous with the two lateral ones, and arti- culates with the most external of the three facettes on the scaphoid : the anterior surface \s triangular, and articulates with the end of the third metatarsal bone: the 6ase (fig. 54.) is rough, and forms part of the convexity of the foot: the apex {fig. 55.) is more obtuse than the same part of the second cuneiform bone, and passes considerably below it. Structure of the bones of the tarsus. The bones of the tarsus present the structure common to all short bones, viz. a mass of spongy tissue surrounded by a layer of compact substance. I have remarked, that in some cases of white swelling of the ankle joint, the os calcis contained in its interior a ca- vity analogous to the medullary canal of long bones. This cavity, however, must be looked upon as altogether abnormal. Development of the tarsal bones. "With the exception of the os calcis, which has two osseous germs, all the bones of the tarsus are developed from single points. The os calcis first becomes ossified. A bony nodule appears in the centre of its cartilage, about the middle of the sixth month of foetal life, ac- cording to most osteogonists; in the fifth, or even the fourth month, according to others. It is placed much nearer the anterior than the posterior extremity of the future bone. Another osseous germ is formed in the posterior extre- mity of the OS calcis, from the eighth to the tenth year, and is much thicker at its lower than at its upper part. The astragalus is developed from one point, which appears from the fifth to the sixth month of inra-uterine life. Ac- cording to Bcclard, the cuboid is not ossified until some months after birth ; I have observed the process to be already commenced in a foetus at the full term. Meckel says that it begins after the eighth month of foetal life. Blumenbach, on the contrary, makes the time of its ossification a year and half, or two years after birth; and Albinus, who has been followed in this respect by the generality of anatomists, aflirms that in the foetus at the full period, all theOSTEOLOGY. 136 bones of the tarsus, excepting the os calcis and the astragalus, still remain car- tilaginous. The cuneiform bones are developed in the following order: — The first is os- sified towards the end of the first year: the second and the third appear almost simultaneously about the fourth year: the os calcis being the only bone of the tarsus which has more than one point of ossification, is also the only bone in which we have to examine the order of union. The two points which form it are not united until the fifteenth year. The Metatarsus (m m',figs. 54< 55, and 56.). The metatarsus forms the second portion of the foot. Like the metacarpus, its analogous part in the hand, it consists of five long bones, parallel to each other, forming a sort of quadrilateral grating, the intervals of which, called in- terosseous spaces, are increased by the disproportion between the ends and the shafts of the bones. The metatarsus presents, 1- an inferior or plantar surface {fig. 55.), with a marked transverse concavity ; 2. a superior or dorsal surface, (fig. 54.), which is convex, and answers to the back of the foot; 3. an internal or tibial edge (m', fig. 56.) which is very thick, and corresponds to the great toe ; 4. an external or fibular edge, which is thin, and corresponds to the httle toe ; 5. a posterior or tarsal extremity, which presents a waved articular line; 6. an anterior or digital extremity, presenting five heads flattened on the sides, which assist in forming five separate articulations. The bones of the metatarsus have certain characters which distinguish them from all others, besides some peculiar marks by which they may be known from each other, and from the metacarpal bones, with which they have many analogies. General Characters of the Metatarsal Bones. The metatarsal bones belong to the class of long bones, both in shape and structure. Each consists of a body and two extremities. The body is prismatic and triangular, and slightly curved, with the concavity below. Two of its sm-faces are lateral, and correspond to the interosseous spaces ; the third, so narrow that it resembles an edge, is on the dorsum of the foot. Two of the edges are lateral; the third is below on the plantar aspect of the foot. The posterior or tarsal extremity is much expanded, and presents five surfaces, two of which are non-articular, and three articular. Of the two non-articular surface sone is superior, and the other inferior; both give attachment to liga- ments. Of the three articular surfaces, one is posterior, that is, on the extremity of the bone ; in general it is triangular, and articulates with a corresponding surface on one of the tarsal bones. The other two are lateral, partly articular, and partly non-articular. The articular surfaces are small, and often consist of more than one ; they join the contiguous metatarsal bones. The tarsal ex- tremity is wedge-shaped; the upper or dorsal surface being very broad, repre- sents the base of the wedge ; the lower surface being narrow, forms the point. The anterior or digital extremity presents a head or condyle flattened on the sides and oblong from above downwards ; the articular surface extends much further on the lower aspect, or in the direction of flexion, than on the upper, or the direction of extension. On the inside and outside of the condyle there is a depression, and a projection behind it for the lateral ligament of the joint. Characters of the different Metatarsal Bones. The first or metatarsal bone of the great toe (,m',figs. 54, 55, 56.) is re- markable for its great size. It is the only one which, in this respect, resembles the tarsus ; its body is shaped like a triangular prism; its digital extremity is marked on'the plantar aspect by a double furrow for two sesamoid bones is,fig. 56 ) (Vide Articidation of the Foot.) Its tarsal extremity presents a semilunar concave surface, with its greatest diameter vertical, which articulates with the137 THE TOES. the internal cuneiform bone. There is no ai-ticular surface on the circumfer- ence of the first metatarsal bone. In this point it resembles the first metacarpal bone, and by this and its great size it is distinguished from all the others. The fifth 'metatarsal bone (m, fig'. 54, 55.) is the shortest after the first; it has only one lateral articular face on its tarsal extremity. On the opposite side of this extremity, -viz. on the outside, we observe a large process, process of the fifth metatarsal hone, shaped like a triangulai- pyramid, and directed obliquely backwards and outwards, into which the peroneus brevis is inserted. This process may be easily felt under the skin, and serves as a guide in the partial amputation of the foot at the tarso-metatarsal articulation. Another character- istic of the fifth metatarsal bone is the great obliquity outwards and backwards of the articular face on its posterior extremity. The second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones are difitinguished from each other by the following characters. The second is the longest, and also the largest after the first; it articulates with the three cimeiform bones by its posterior extremity, which is dovetailed with them. The third and the fourth metatarsal bones are of almost equal length; their apparent difference in an articulated foot depends chiefly on the fact, that the articulation of the fourth with the cuboid is on a plane poste- rior to that of the third with the external cuneiform bone. Lastly, they may be known from each other by the presence of two surfaces, on the inside of the posterior extremity of the fourth metatarsal; one being for the external cuneiform bone, and the other for the third metatarsal bone. Development. The metatarsal bones are developed from two points ; one for the body, and one for the anterior or digital extremity. The first metatarsal bone is the only exception to this rule, for its epiphysary point is situated at the posterior extremity.* The osseous point of the body appears first during the third month, according to the majority of authors, but about the forty-fifth day, according to the observations of Blumenbach and Beclard. It is com- pletely developed in the foetus at the full period. The epiphysary point makes its appearance during the second year. The union of these parts does not take place untU the eighteenth or nineteenth year, and is not simultaneous in all the bones of the metatarsus. The epiphysis of the first metatarsal bone is the first to unite with the body. An interval of a year sometimes intervenes be- tween the union of this epiphysis and those of the other foui" metatarsal bones. The Toes {n o r,n r. Jigs. 5't, 55.). The resemblance between the phalanges of the fingers and those of the toes is so complete, that we cannot do better than refer to the description already given of the former, for details respecting the latter. At the same time it should be remarked, that the phalanges of the toes appear, as it were, atrophied, or stinted in growth, when compared with those of the fingers, excepting the great toe, wliich in all its parts preserves the large dimensions of the inner side of the foot. The first or metatarsal phalanx (n to n') resembles closely the metacarpal phalanx of the fingers. The middle phalanx (o) is remarkably small and short : it would almost appear to consist of the extremities alone, the body being ab- sent. At first sight it might be taken for a pisiform bone, or rather for one of the pieces of the coccyx ; but the presence of anterior and posterior articular laces is sufficient to mark the distinction. The ungual phalanges (r r') of the toes resemble in form, but are much smauer than the corresponding parts of the fingers. This remark, however, low betwe™?hn°^„?7f?'P?"v?'

I cannot conclude this description without remarking that the articular surface of the posterior extremity of the meta- tarsal phalanges, as weU as of the anterior extremity of the metatarsal bones, is prolonged further upwards than the corresponding surfaces on the meta- carpal bones and phalanges of the fingers; this arrangement allows a greater extension of the toes, and is an important element in the mechanism of progres- sion. Development. The first, second, and third phalanges are developed from two points of ossification ; one for the body, and one for the metatarsal extremity. The epiphysary points of the second and third phalanges are so small, that their existence has been doubted by many anatomists. The osseous points of the bodies of the first phalanges are much later in appearing than those of the metatarsal bones, not being visible in general imtil from the second to the fourth month ; the first phalanx of the great toe is an exception, its ossification commencing from the fiftieth to the sixtieth day. The epiphysary point of the first phalanges does not appear until the fourth year. The bodies of the second phalanges are ossified almost at the same time as those of the first; the epiphysary point of their posterior extremity is not visible imtil from the sixth to the seventh year. The bodies of the third phalanges are ossified before those of the second and the first; an osseous point appears in them about the forty-fifth day, excepting in the little toe, where it is much later. The ungual phalanx of the great toe is remarkable as being ossified before all the other phalanges of the toes. It is developed from a point which does not occupy the centre, but the summit of the phalanx. The epiphysary point of the posterior extremity appears about the fifth year in the great toe, and about the sixth year in the other four. The epiphysary points of the phalanges are not united to the bodies until the age of seventeen or eighteen years. General Development of the Inferior Extremity. The most characteristic feature of the lower extremity in the fatus is the comparative lateness of its development, which is most remarkable at the early periods We have already stated the periods at which each pomt of ossification appears in the different bones, and the times at which they are united, and it now only remains for us to point out some pecuharities of development which have not been included in the description of the bones. From the observations of Bichat, it is generaUy admitted that the neck of the femur in the foetus and the newly-born infant is proportionaUy shorter than in the adult, and forms almost a right angle with the shaft of the bone ; that the body of the femur is ahnost straight; and that its extremities are pro- portionaUy much larger than they become subsequently. As we before ob- served with regard to the upper extremities, all these assertions are at variance wTth the results of our observations. The same reflections apply equally to the bones of the leg, the torsion of which we believe to exist to the same degree m the f(ptus and in the new-born infant, as in the adult. After bS, the development of the lower limbs proceeds more rapidly than .V, . ft^r^TAner and the final proportions are not attamed until the age of I 1 Tn tRed the phalanges of the toes are often anchylosed ; but this P""- ^ikl tS dSocations^f the^oes, and some deformities of the tarsus and union, like the dislocatio^^^^^^ ^ ^^^^ occasioned by tight ret-d'the mS: J/S^coVlete immoLity in which the parts are main- tained.* - mntr ronsult a verv curious memoir, by Camper, on tlie incon- * On this subject the ff^^f^^^f Xch he Attributes, 1. the shortening of the second toe ; veniences arising irom tight ^hof.To this we may add the luxation, outwards, ^of rr^^'p^oV^eTreat'to: ["ndtr luxation, inwards, ^of the first phalanx of the se- cond, and sometimes of the third toe.139 COMPARISON OF THE EXTREMITIES.

But we do not deem it proper to apply the same rule to the paraUel between the upper and lower extremities ; for that is founded on such nume- rous and striking points of analogy, and has become so much a subject of in- struction, that we should consider it a serious omission did we here neglect giving a brief notice of it. The upper and the lower extremities are evidently constructed after the same type, but present certain modifications corresponding to the difference of their functions. I should remark in this place, that some of these analogies are very manifest and satisfactory, and greatly facilitate the remembrance ot important anatomical detaUs; while others are far-fetched and wholly destitute of useful application: these will be passed over with a simple notice. shall now compare in succession the shoulder and the haunch, the humerus and the femur, the fore-arm and the leg, the hand and the foot. Comparison of the Shoulder and the Pelvis. Before the time of Vicq-d'Azyr, anatomists were in the habit of considering the clavicle and the scapula among the bones of the upper extremity, but re- garded the OS innominatum or haunch as belonging to the trunk; and yet the most simple reflection is sufficient to establish the analogy between the shoulder and the haunch. In order the more readily to appreciate the points of resem- blance and difference between these parts, it is advisable to follow the method adopted by Vicq-d'Azyr, of studying the shoulder reversed; or, what is the same thing, to compare the aspect of the shoulder which corresponds to the head, with that of the pelvis, which answers to the coccyx ; remembering at the same time, that for a long period after birth the haunch-bone is formed of three distinct pieces—the ilium, the ischium, and the pubes. 1. The shoidders form an osseous girdle, intended to form a point of support for the upper extremities, in the same manner as the haunch does for the lower extremities. The girdle formed by the shoulders is interrupted in front in the situation of the stemum, and behind, opposite the vertebral column; hence there are two shoulders, while the haunch-bones constitute one united whole. The shoulder, therefore, and consequently the arm of one side, are completely independent of those of the other, but the two lower extremities have a solid bond of union. 2. The second point of difference relates to the comparative dimensions of the pelvis and the shoulder. The great size of the pelvis, the thickness of its edges, the depth of its notches, and the prominence of its eminences, contrast strongly with the slender construction of the shoulder, and the thin edges of the scapula, and are in harmony with the uses of the lower extremities. 3. The broad portion of the scapula is analogous to the iliac portion of the 08 innominatum; the internal iliac fossa is analogous to the subscapular fossa. 4. The supra and infra-spinous fossae correspond to the external iliac fossa; but the ilium has no part analogous to the spine of the scapula. 5. The axillary border of the scapula answers to the anterior edge of the os mnominatum. The spinal border is analogous to the crest of the ilium. The superior border of the scapula corresponds to the posterior border of the os innominatum; and the coracoid notch on this border, with the coracoid ligament which converts it into a foramen, are analogous to the sciatic notch, and the sacro-sciatic ligaments. 6. The glenoid cavity is evidently analogous to the acetabulum; according140 OSTEOLOGY. to Vicq-d'Azyr, the coracoid and the acromion processes are represented by the tuberosity of the ischium and the pubes, -with this remarkable diiFerence only, that the two processes of the shoulder are separated from each other by the large acromio-coracoid notch, while in the pelvis the ischium and the pubes are united, and, instead of including a notch, form the circumference of a fo- ramen, the obtui'ator. This analogy is not universally admitted; for the ischium being intended to sustain the weight of the body when sitting, bears no resem- blance in this respect to the shoulder. One of the most striking analogies be- tween the shoulder and the pelvis is that of the clavicle and the horizontal portion of the pubes ; with this difference, that the clavicle is articulated with the scapula, while the pubes is united by bone to the ilium. Without forcing an analogy, we may trace a similitude between the symphysis pubis, and the union of the clavicles by means of the interclavicular ligament. Comparison of the Arm-bone and the Thigh. In order to make the parallel exact, we must remember the relative situation of these two bones, and compare the right femur with the left humerus; and the side of flexion, that is, the posterior aspect of the first, with the side of flexion or the anterior aspect of the second. This bemg determined, we must place the linea aspera of the femur in front, and the humerus in its natural position. The humerus is much smaller than the femur, being about a third shorter, and only half the weight and bulk. The humerus is placed vertically, and almost parallel to the axis of the trunk; in this it contrasts with the marked obliquity of the thigh-bones, which touch each other at their lower ends. The humeri are separated from each other by a greater distance than the femora; this dif- ference depends on the conformation of the human thorax, which is flattened in front and behind, while in quadrupeds it is flattened on the sides, and per- mits the approximation of the humeri, which serve as pillars of support to the fore part of the trunk. _ . . . The humerus is not curved like the femur, but, on the other hand, it is much more twisted, and presents an oblique groove, which does not exist in the femur. We shall compare in succession the shafts and the extremities of these bones. . „ „ , , *i 1. Comparison of the shafts. The posterior surface of the humerus exactly corresponds to the anterior surface of the femur, being, bke it, smooth and rounded The external surface resembles the external plane of the femur, with some differences ; the impression for the gluteus maximus is evidently ana- loeous to the deltoid impression. The internal surface is in contact with the brachial artery, as is the internal surface of the femur with the femoral artery. The anterior edge is a sort of linea aspera, analogous to that of the femur, and, like it, terminating by a bifurcation at its upper part. 2 Comparison of the lower ends of the bones. Although the differences between these parts are very marked, we can yet detect, m the one bone, traces of all the more important points of structure observed in the other. Thus the in- ernS Ind^xternal tuberosities of the humerus evidently resemble those of he femiT and they are both intended for the insertion of muscles and liga- !nltr^he trochlea of the humerus resembles that of the femur, with this ; tbnt^n the femui- the two borders of the pulley diverge from each SrSn?X?in^^t^^ they are paralfel throughout.

Comparison of the Leg and Fore-arm. The fore-arm is that portion of the upper extremity, which is represented by the leg in the lower. Each is composed of two bones; but while the leg is essentially constituted by the tibia, which alone enters into the formation of the knee-joint, and the greater part of the ankle-joint, both the radius and the ulna contribute, almost in an equal degree, to that of the fore-arm; and al- though the ulna forms the greater part of the elbow-jomt, the radius, by a sort of compensation, is the chief bone of the wrist-joint. _ • ^i Although the general analogy between the fore-arm and leg is sufliciently striking, it is not so easy to trace the corresponding parts in detail. Anato- mists are much at variance on this subject, particularly as to which bone ot the fore-arm corresponds to the tibia. . _ _ Vicq-d'Azyr, from a consideration of the elbow and the knee-joints, came to the conclusion, that the ulna is analogous to the tibia, and the radius to the fibula. M. de BlainviUe, on the contrary, reflecting on the relations between the leg and foot, and the fore-arm and hand, and considering that the tibia is placed on the same line with the great toe, and the radius with the thumb, and also that in the fore-arm the radius constitutes the chief part of the wrist- joint, and that in the leg the tibia is most concerned in the ankle-joint, is of opinion that the tibia and the radius are analogous parts. We shall adopt what is true in either opinion, and reject what appears to us too unconditionally stated or incorrect; and therefore, considering, 1. that neither of the bones of the leg resembles, by itself, one of the bones of the fore-ai-m, 2. that each bone of the leg has some characters, both of the ulna and of the radius, 3. that the natm-al position of the fore-arm being that of pronation, and that the leg being in a state of constant pronation, it is in- correct to compare the fore-ann when supinated with the leg when in the opposite position, 4. that comparative anatomy has shown, in ruminating animals, the upper extremity of the ulna to be blended with the radius, and a slender process on the external aspect of the fore-arm resembling the fibula, we are inclined to believe, that the upper end of the tibia is represented by the upper half of the ulna, and the lower half of the tibia by the lower half of the radius; whUe the fibula is represented by the upper part of the radius and the lower part of the ulna. If we enter into details, we shall see how plausible this comparison is ia reality. Comparison of the Upper Half of the Ulna and the Upper Half of the Tibia. The horizontal portion of the great sigmoid cavity of the ulna is repre- sented by the upper end of the tibia, and the crest which separates the two surfaces of the cavity is analogous to the spine of the tibia. The patella and the olecranon are constructed after the same type; the mobility of the first, and the fixture of the last, are not essential differences. The body of the ulna is prismatic and triangular, like that of the tibia; its internal surface is super- ficial and almost subcutaneous, like the anterior surface of the tibia; its posterior edge (crest of the ulna) is prominent, and represents the crest of the tibia; it is equally superficial, and serves as a guide in the diagnosis and co- aptation of fractures. As in the tibia, the crest of the ulna is continuous with a triangular tuberosity, which may be called the posterior tuberosity of the ulna, and is analogous to the anterior tuberosity of the tibia.142 OSTEOLOGY. Comparison of llie Lower Part of the Radius and the Lower Part of the Tibia. The quadrangular lower end of the radius corresponds to the equally quadrangular lower extremity of the tibia. The inferior articular surface of both is divided into two parts, by an antero-posterior ridge. The ulnar side of the lower end of the radius is hollowed into an articular cavity, in the same way as the fibular side of the lower end of the tibia. The styloid process of the radius answers to the internal malleolus of the tibia. Both extremities exhibit furrows for the passage of tendons. Comparison of the Hand and Foot. The back of the foot corresponds with the back of the hand, the sole with the palm, the tibial edge of the one with the radial edge of the other; the fibular and the ulnar borders are analogous; the tarsal extremity of the foot corresponds with the carpal extremity of the hand, and each has a digital ex- tremity. But amidst these features of resemblance, which are sufficient to establish the old adage, pes altera manus, we find also great differences. Thus the foot exceeds the hand both in size and weight, being longer and thicker, though it is narrower: this excess of volume does not affect the toes, which are incomparably smaller than the fingers; nor the metatarsus, but is confined to the tarsus, of which the carpus seems little more than a vestige. A second characteristic difference is the absence of the power of opposition in the great toe. As far as regards function, indeed, it may be truly said, that the want of this power constitutes a foot, and the possession of it a hand. A third difference results from the mode of articulation of the leg with the foot, for the leg does not articulate with the posterior extremity of the tarsus, but with its upper surface, so that a part of the tarsus projects behind the joint, and the axis of the foot forms a right angle with that of the leg. These remarks will suffice to show the general differences between the hand and the foot. Comparison of the Bones of the Carpus and Tarsus. While the carpus scarcely forms the eighth part of the hand, the tarsus con- stitutes half the foot. Its antero- posterior diameter, which is five or six inches, is three times greater than the transverse diameter, precisely contrary to what is the case in the hand. The tarsus resembles a vault, concave below, both in the antero-posterior and transverse directions ; and receives the leg upon its summit. The carpus is nothing more than a groove for tendons. It is mani- fest that the carpus is only the rudiment of the tarsus, which is not surprising, if we consider that the former is truly the fundamental part of the foot, and the basis of support to the whole body. "We shall examine in detail the analogies and the differences of these two constituent parts of the foot and the hand. They differ in the following respects: 1. There are eight bones in the carpus —there are only seven in the tarsus; 2. Each of the two rows of the carpus is composed of four bones—the first row of the tarsus consists of two bones, and the second of five; 3. The bones of the first row of the tarsus are placed one above the other, not arranged side by side as in the first row of the carpus • 4 One tarsal bone only enters into the formation of the ankle-jomt, while three of the carpal bones are concerned in the wrist-joint; lastly, the second row of the tarsus is subdivided into two secondary rows on the mside, a posterior, formed by the scaphoid, and an anterior, formed by the three cu- neiform bones. „ , . j ^ ^.i. * We shaU now compare the bones of these two regions, and for the want of their resemblance in shape, we shall have recourse to that of their mode of connection,—a method which is perhaps more constant and important than that which is founded upon a character so variable as figure.COMPARISON OF THE EXTREMITIES. 143 Comparison of the Metatarsal Row of the Tarsus with the Metacarpal Row of the Carpus. The metatarsal and the metacarpal rows are evidently more analogous to each other than the first rows of each region, and have therefore heen chosen for the purpose of establishing the paraUel. • i *• 1 The cuboid is manifestly analogous to the os uncifoi-me ; their relative po- sitions are the same ; their forms are in a great measm-e similar; and while the cuboid is attached to the two last metatarsal bones, the os unciforme arti- culates with the two last metacarpal. This analogy bemg admitted we shaU find in the three cuneiform bones the representatives of the three other bones of the second row of the carpus, viz. the trapezium, the trapezoid, and the os "'o" W™'must admit here that the analogies now become much less evident. Nevertheless, the third cuneifonn bone, which from being in contact with the cuboid should represent the os magnum, which is contiguous to the os unciforme, does so far agree, that it articulates with the third metatarsal bone, as the os magnum does with the third metacarpal; and, what is sufficiently remarkable, the thii-d cuneiform has a slight connection with the second metatarsal, as the OS magnum has with the second metacarpal. Although, therefore, we do not find in the third cuneiform bone any thing approaching to the size of the os magnum, or resembling the remarkable head of that bone, we should not on that account hastily conclude that they have no analogy. We shall explain afterwards how this fact should be interpreted : we only wish it to be admitted in this place, that the base or metacarpal portion of the os magnum is repre- sented by the third cuneiform bone. 3. The second cuneiform bone, which corresponds to the trapezoid, supports the second metatarsal, as the trapezoid supports the second metacarpal. 4. The first cuneiform bone, which supports the first metatarsal, corresponds to the trapezium, which supports the first bone of the metacarpus. All these analo- gies, it must be confessed, are very imperfect, and founded rather upon the con- nections than the forms of the different bones. In fact, what resemblance is there between the three large cuneiform bones aU cut into facette-like wedges and aU so like each other in shape, and the bones of the carpus to which we have compared them ? Above aU, what comparison can be established between the third cuneiform, which exactly resembles a wedge, and the os magnum, which has a rounded head ? There is nothing in the metatarsal range of the tarsus which represents the rounded head which belongs to the metacarpal row of the carpus ; but the following considerations, which did not escape the notice of Vicq-d'Azyr, wiU serve to solve the difficulty. 1. It is an observation which applies with sufficient generality to the whole skeleton, that when two bones move upon each other, one being provided with a head, and the other with a cavity, the head moves upon the cavity, not the cavity on the head. Thus, the femur moves upon the os innominatum ; the humerus upon the scapula. 2. The hand, in the performance of its functions, almost always moves upon the fore-arm. In the movements of the hand, the metacarpal row of the carpus moves upon the first row, and therefore the me- tacarpal row presents the head. On the contrary, in the movements of the hones of the tarsus during progression, the bones of the first row always move upon those of the second or metatarsal row; and consequently, instead of finding a rounded head in the second row, we meet with it in the first. Proceeding thus by the method of exclusion, it now only remains for lis to establish the analogy between the bones of the first row of the carpus on the one hand, and the scaphoid, the os calcis, and astragalus on the other. The analogies here are very equivocal, and are not agreed upon amone an- atomists, ox- 6144 OSTEOLOGY. Comparison of the First Row of the Tarsus with the First Mow of the Carpus. As there are only three hones in the posterior ro-w of the tarsus, which cor- respond to the antihrachial or superior row of the carpus, it might be supposed, a priori, that one of these would correspond to two of the bones of the first row of the carpus. A very slight examination of the tarsus and the carpus in a quadruped will show at once, that the pisiform bone is represented by that part of the os calcis which projects behind the astragalus. The os calcis is the only bone of the tarsus which is developed from two points; and this es- tablishes a strong presumption in favour of the opinion, that it represents two bones. K we admit the analogy of the back part of the os calcis with the pi- siform bone, the anterior portion of this bone would represent the cuneiform or pyramidal bone of the carpus ; and as this last articulates with the os imci- forme so the anterior portion of the os calcis unites with its representative, the cuboid. The os calcis then m.ay be considered as representing the cuneiform and the pisiform bones blended together and much augmented in size. It remains then to establish the analogy between the scaphoid and semilunar bones of the hand, and the astragalus and scaphoid of the foot. The scaphoid of the hand resembles the scaphoid of the foot, both in form and connections. The similarity of shape has led to the identity of name: and with regard to connections, we find that the scaphoid of the foot is at- tached to the three cuneiform bones, and that of the hand to the trapezium, the trapezoid, and the os magnum, which represent the three cuneiform bones; and lastly we observe, that the scaphoid bone of the foot is placed on the same side as the great toe, and that the scaphoid bone of the hand is placed on the same side as the thumb. There is, however, one remarkable difference be- tween them, viz. that the scaphoid bone of the hand articulates with the fore- arm while that of the foot has no connection with the leg. We have now only to discover in the tarsus the representative of the semi- lunar bone AU the rest of the bones being now excluded, we can only con- clude with Vicq-d'Azyr, that the astragalus is its counterpart, with the mere addition of a rounded head. Comparison of the Metacarpus and the Metatarsus. Five small long bones, arranged paraUel to each other, form both the meta- carpus and the metatarsus. In both there are four interosseous spaces : these a?e larger in the hand than in the foot, because there is a greater disproportion between the bulk of the extremities and shafts of the metacarpal than of he metatarsal bones ; the metacarpus, from being shorter, appears broader ban the meta arsus. The most distinguishing character of the metacarpus is the fact, £ the metacarpal bone of the thumb is the shortest of the whole, and is si- Sa ed on a plane anterior to the others ; and that its direction is oblique aU wh ch drc^stances bear reference to the movement of opposition, which is r.v tnTp hand The characteristic mark of the metatarsus is the size Pf.SXst Setatosal bone! which greatly exceeds that of aU the others.

The tarsal extremities are more regu- larly cuneiform than the corresponding ends of the metacarpal bones. The most characteristic differences, however, of these two series of bones are found in the digital extremities, which are incomparably larger in the me- tacarpus than in the metatarsus, the fingers being the chief part of the hand, while the tarsus is the principal portion of the foot. We should also remark, that the convex articular surfaces of the digital ends of the metatarsal bones are prolonged further on the dorsal aspect, than the corresponding surfaces of the metacarpal bones. Comparison of the Phalanges o f the Fingers and Toes. The fingers, being the essential organs of prehension and the fundamental part of the hand, greatly exceed the toes both in length and thickness, and the latter may be looked upon as representing in rudiment the former, being pre- cisely analogous in structure. The phalanges of the toes may therefore be regarded as phalanges of the fingers in a state of atrophy ; but the great toe forms a remarkable exception to this rule, for its phalanges are much larger in proportion to the other toes, than the phalanges of the thumb are to the other fingers. This magnitude of the great toe corresponds to the size of its metatarsal bone, and accords with its destination, as constituting the principal support for the weight of the body in front. The first phalanx of the toes exactly resembles the first phalanx of the fingers in all things but volume. The middle phalanx of the toes can scarcely be recognised from its diminutive size: it may be said to want the shaft aitogether, the extremities being in contact. As we have already re- marked it might at first sight be confounded with a pisiform, or a sesamoid bone, or stiU more readily with a piece of the coccyx. Comparison of the Upper and Lower Extremities with regard to Development. The development of the lower extremities is proportionally less rapid than that of the upper. The clavicle and the scapula are ossified before the os innominatum. The ossification of the skeleton commences in the clavicle; in this bone, the osseous nodule is visible from the twenty-fifth to the thirtieth day; it appears in the scapula about the fortieth day. The osseous point of the ilium is visible about the forty-fifth day, that of the ischium in the third month, and that of the pubes in the fifth month. The scapula is completely ossified at the age of twenty years, the marginal process of the crest of the ilium is scarcely united until the twenty-fifth year. The bony centres of the shafts of the femur and humerus are almost simultaneous in their appearance. The germ of the lower end of the femur always exists at birth; that of the lower end of the humerus does not appear until the end of the first year ; but this latter unites with the bone at eighteen years, while the former is still separate at twenty years. The tibia is ossified a little before the bones of the fore-arm, the fibula a little after them. The ossification of the leg and the fore- arm is completed almost about the same time. The ossification of the bones of the tarsus precedes that of the carpus by a considerable period. Thus, at frome four and a half to five months of foetal life, abony point is visible in the OS calcis, and some days after in the astragalus ; the os magnum and os cunei- forme (which, however, are not the representatives of the preceding), do not show ossific points until a year after birth. The pisiform bone is not ossified until the twelfth year; while the latest of the tarsal bones, the scaphoid, is converted into bone at the fifth year. Nevertheless, the epiphysary point of the OS calcis (which we have shown to be analogous to the pisiform bone) does not become visible until the tenth year; this fact strengthens the analogy between the pisiform bone and the epiphysary lamina of the os calcis VOL. I.146 OSTEOLOGY. The metatarsal bones are developed in exactly the same manner as the me- tacarpal, only at a somewhat later period. The union of the epiphyses takes place a little earlier in the metatarsus than in the metacarpus. The toes are ossified at a later period than the fingers; especiaUy the ungual and the second phalanges, which are much later than those of the fingers. It is, no doubt, impossible to state the precise reason for these differences; but it is sufficient to find a positive relation between the rate of development of these parts, and the offices they are intended to fulfil. The Os Hyoides, or the Hyoid Apparatus* {Jig 57.). The OS hyoides has a parabolic form, resembling the upsilon of the Greeks, _ ^ whence its name. It is the only bone which is de- tached from the rest of the skeleton; it is connected only by ligaments and muscles, and is situated be- tween the base of the tongue and the larynx. It is larger in the male than in the female. It is placed almost horizontaUy, the concavity of its curve look- ing backwards, and the convexity forwards.

This ligament, which is sometimes ossified in man, is always a bony connection in the lower animals. * Internal structure. The hyoid bone is composed chiefly of compact tissue; but there is a small quantity of spongy tissue in the thick parts of the body and the great comua. Developmeiit. The os hyoides is developed from five pomts; one for the body, two for the great comua, and two for the little cornua. Some anato- mists admit two points for the body, and make the whole number six. The ossification of the great cornua precedes that of the body, which be- comes bony soon after birth; the little comua are not ossified until some months after. All the pieces are at first separated by considerable portions of cartilage, afterwards by a very thin layer, which sometimes remains during life, and gives the difierent parts of the bone a great degree of mobility. • In the lower animals the styloid process is detached from the cranium, and forms one of the hyoid chain of bones, which is composed, I. of the five pieces of the os hyoides ; 2. of the bones which supply the place of the styloid ligaments: 3. of the styloid processes, or rather bones: nine pieces in all.us THE ARTICULATIONS, or ARTI1R0L0(}Y. ■■^General observations.—Articular cartilages.—Ligaments.— Synovial membrane.^. —Classification of the joints.—Diarthroses.—Synarthroses.—Amphiarlhroses, or symphyses. The bones are united together by the joints or articulations. The study of these parts is the object of syndesmology, or more properly of arlhrology (&p9poi', a joint). In examining each joint it is necessary to consider, 1. the con- tiguous surfaces of the bones, or the articular surfaces; 2. the uniting medium, or the ligaments; 3. the means or conditions which facilitate the motion of the parts, the synovial membranes; and 4. the movements of which the joint is capable. * It is impossible to insist too much upon the Importance of a careful study of the articulations. There is no part of anatomy a thorough knowledge of which is more indispensable both to the physiologist and the surgeon; without it the former cannot form a correct idea of the animal mechanism, nor can the latter appreciate the nature of those numerous injuries and diseases of which the articulations are the seat. Before describing the forms and the motions of the different joints, it is necessary to give a general idea of the articular cartilages, the synovial mem- branes, the ligaments, &c.; in short, of all the means which contribute to secure the solidity and mobility of the articulations The Articular Cartilages. It has been observed f,that when two osseous surfaces in immediate contact rub upon each other, they are gradually absorbed in such a manner as to render the movements between them difficult and painful. In order to avoid these injurious effects in the joints, the contiguous surfaces of the bones are covered by a layer of cartilage (the incrusting or articular cartilage), a substance which unites in itself the qualities of solidity, pliability, and elasticity in a high degree, yielding when compressed, and returning to its former state when the pressure is removed. These articular cartilages exist in all the moveable joints. The extent of surface which they cover is generally proportioned to the extent of motion in the joints. Their thickness is generally greatest, when the bones which they cover are most moveable, and most subjected to pressure. An articular cartilage is not of uniform thickness throughout Thus, on convex surfaces the cartilaginous layer is thicker in the centre than at the circumference; and, on the other hand, the cartilages of articular cavities are thickest at the circumference. The most perfect co-aptation results from this arrangement. It should also be remarked, that the most violent shocks are applied to the centre of the heads of the bones, and to the circumference of the Thf articular cartilages present, 1. a free surface, perfectly smooth and nolished which is in the interior of the articulation; 2. an adherent surface, which is so closely attached to the tissue of the bone, that it is impossible to separate it excepting in cases of disease. In some cases of white swelling, 1 have been able to remove the articular cartUages with great facdity, and in these it appeared that the adherent surface of the cartilage was very irregidar, and that the fibres of the bone were implanted in it by mnumerable small pro- ^°°ThcrTis another kind of cartilage existing in certain joints in the form of .Throe of these, vi^.thecon^^^^^^^^^^ reaf>r/f ti<^n; aad^^L ™= the shape of the artleu.ar surfaces, and *"f .rbsorption of the eartilages is a frequent disease of the johits, and oLligos the individuals affected by it to maintain constant rest.149 LIGAMENTS. L 3 thin plates, having both surfaces free, and being interposed between two arti- culating bones. These are generally found in such joints as are exposed to the most violent shocks, and subjected to the most frequent movements ; they are known by the name of inter-articular cartilages. Their use is to adjust the contact of the surfaces on the bones, to moderate the intensity of the shocks to which they may be submitted, to increase in some cases the depth of the articular cavities, and to impart solidity to the joints. They are almost always bi-concave, from which circumstance the name of meniscus is sometimes ap- plied to them (from ixijvn, luna); they are thick at the circumference, and very thin in the centre, which is sometimes perforated. These two kinds of cartilage are found only in those joints, the surfaces of which are simply in contact. The articulations of continuous surfaces are provided with cartilages very different from the above, and which should be looked upon as non-ossified portions of the original cartilage of ossification. The progress of ossification always encroaches upon them, while the regular articular cartilages are never affected in this way. It will be seen afterwards that the articular cartilages are inorganic, like the enamel of the teeth, and the homy tissues, which are worn away by attrition, and are not susceptible of any lesions excepting such as arise from mechanical injury or chemical action.* The Ligaments. ^ The ligaments constitute a very important division of the fibrous tissue, which is met with in all parts where great resistance and great flexibility are required; and in no part of the body are these requisites more necessary than in the joints. They consist of bundles of flexible and inextensible fibres of a pearly white lustre, sometimes parallel, and sometimes interlaced. Some- times they are placed between the osseous surfaces, and are then named interosseous; sometimes, on the contrary, they occupy the circumference of the surfaces, and are then called peripheral or capsular. The peripheral ligaments present two surfaces, a deep surface lined by the synovial membrane, which is intimately united to it, and a superficial, which is in contact with the muscles, tendons, nerves, vessels, and cellular tissue ; and also iwo extremities which are attached to the bones, at a greater or less distance from the cartilage. The adhesion of these parts is so intimate, that it is easier to break either the liga- ment or the bone than to separate them at the precise place of their union. The ligaments may be classed under two very distinct heads: 1. the fasci- culated, or those which exist in bundles ; and 2. the membranous or capsular. The ligaments, properly so caUed, belong to the first class; the fibrous cap- sules belong to the second. We may admit a third form, which consists of scat- tered fibres, too far separated to form fasciculated ligaments, and too few in number to constitute articular capsules. We should include also, in the class ot articular Ugaments, two very remarkable modifications of the fibrous tissue. 1. Ihz articular borders : these are circlets of fibres which surmount the mar- gins of articular cavities, belonging to that class of joints denominated enar- tnroses ; they augment the depth of the cavities, and act as a kind of pad to Dreak the force of impulsion of the articular head against the brim of the ca- vity, and prevent this edge from breaking. 2. The j/ellow or elastic ligaments, wnicn are characterised by their yellow colour, extensibility, and elasticity ; nence the name of i/ellow elastic tissue has been given to them on account of their colour and chief property. arc\mo?gai'is"rt.f '="'"'>ees may be non-vascular, it is scarcely correct to say that tlioy in^an^atomy [o a'jfv^TrJctun^^ "^-^J''" "f 'l^^ Latins, is applied we speak -rf thf/™„d ^ml J^™ fj™' '° Ti^ 'J'Te'-ent parts to each otlier.

In every pan of the body where fibres move, they are surrounded by cel- lular tissue, which secretes a lubricating fluid to facilitate their motions; and, where surfaces move upon each other, they are covered by a membrane which exudes a fluid, varying in its nature, accordmg as the motions are confined to simple ghdTng, or ^are%ccompanied by a certain amount of friction, In the first case the membranes secrete a watery or serous fluid, and are consequently EomTnated sermu> membranes : in the second, the liquid is of an unctuous nature resembling white of egg; it is called synovia {avy with, and a,b^, an egg), and [he membranl synovial membrane. All the moveable articiJations are pro- vided wiTh a synovial membrane or capsule, by means of which the parts are lonstantly lubricated with a viscid unctuous fluid, that favours the exact adapt- ation of the articular surfaces, obviates the effects of friction, and maintams them in contact. This is the cause of the noise or cracking which results from the sudden separation of the articular surfaces. The synovial capsules, which have been well described by Monro are thin transpareymembranes, forming shut sacs, whi^ch cover the f eaj f the bo^^^^ without admitting them into the interior of the cavity. In fact, it is their SerS .«r/ace which adheres more or less intimately to the ligaments and other parts which surround the joint, while their tnten.al surfaces are in con- Set with each other, and are constantly lubricated by the synovia. It is a QuestTon among anatomists, whether the synovial membrane covers also the articSr cartuLes.

For this reason we shaU reject it because in the study of anatomy the consideration of functions is ot se- condary importance, compared to that of structure. The motions of a joint are also evidendy the consequence of the shape of its articular surfaces. The classification now generally adopted is that of Galen, with some modi- fications. Taking the presence or absence of mobility as the primary ground of division, the articulations are divided into the moveable or diarthroses, and the immoveable or mjnarthroses. To these two great divisions Winslow has added a third, under the name of mixed articulations, or amphiarthroses (S/i*a), both), because they participate of the characters of both, viz. mobility, and continuity of surfaces.* For the determination of the secondary divisions regard has been had both to the shape of the articular surfaces, and to the movements of which the joint is capable. Thus, the diarthrosesh.ave'been subdivided into 1. enarthroses, when the head of one bone is received into the cavity of another ; 2. arthrodia, when the articular surfaces are plane, or nearly so; 3. ginglymus, when the ioint is only capable of opposition, that is, of alternate movements in opposite directions in the same plane. This latter class is again subdivided into (a) an- gular ginglymus or hinge-joints, when the movements are angular, as in flexion or extension: the angular ginglymus is said to be perfect, when these move- ments alone are possible, as in the elbow ; and imperfect, when a slight degree of lateral motion may take place, as in the knee : (6) lateral ginglymus (or diar- throsis trochoides), when rotation is the only possible movement. It also is subdivided into simple, when the bones touch only by one point; and double, when they have two points of contact. The synarthroses, or immoveable joints, have been divided according to the nature of their articular surfaces into, 1. suture, when they are furnished with teeth, by means of which they are locked together, as in the squamous suture; 2. harmonia, when the surfaces are nearly smooth, and are merely in juxta- position ; 3. gomphosis, when one part is implanted in another, as the teeth in the alveoli; 4. schindylesis, when a plate of one bone is received into a groove of another: in this way the osseous projection of the anterior edge of the pa- late bone is attached to the opening of the maxiUary sinus, f There are many advantages in the above classification, but many imperfec- tions also. I would characterise as especially objectionable, the class arthrodia, which comprises the most dissimilar articulations, as the shoulder joint, the articulations of the lower jaw, of the wrist, of the bones of the carpus, and of those of the tarsus. We should also notice as another cause of imperfection, * This kind of articulation was linown to Galen, and named by him neuter, or doubtful articulation. + [The rostrum of the sphenoid, and the descending plate of the ethmoid, are united iu thU manner to the vomer, and afford, perhaps, a better example.]152 ARTHROLOGY. the -want of unity in the basis of the classification, which is sometimes founded upon the shape of the surfaces, sometimes on the motions. By adopting the shape of the articular surfaces alone, as a basis, we shall find the arrangement of the ligaments and the motions to be in some measure dependent upon this. On this principle we shall divide all the joints into three classes: 1. the diarthroses (Slapdpou')*, or those which are formed by bones, the surfaces of which are contiguous, but free ; 2. synarthroses {(tvv, with), or all the joints whose surfaces are continuous ; 3. amphiarthroses, or symphyses, (&IJ.(pa!, both), or those joints whose surfaces are partly contiguous, and partly continuous by means of fibrous tissue. 1. Diarthroses. Characters. Contiguous or free articular surfaces, shaped so as to fit ex- actly upon each other, and each provided, 1. with an incrusting layer of car- tilage ; 2. with synovial membranes; 3. with peripheral ligaments ; joints always moveable. This class is divided into six subdivisions : — 1. Enarthrosis. Characters. Ahead, or portion of a sphere, more or less completely received into a cavity. Examples : hip and shoulder joints {Jig. 76. and figs. 69 and 70.). Ligaments. A fibrous capsule. Motions. In every direction; viz. flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction, and rotation. 2. Articulation by mutual Reception. Characters. Articular surfaces concave in one direction, convex in the direction perpendicular to the first, and so fitted as to embrace each other reci- procally. Example : articulation of the trapezium with the first metacarpal bone {m,fig. 75.). Ligaments. Two or four ligaments, or rather an orbicular or capsular liga- ment. Motions. In all directions, like the enarthroses, excepting rotation. 3. Articulation by Condyles, or Condylarthrosis. Characters. An elongated head, or condyle, received into an elliptical ca- vity. Examples: articulation of the fore-arm and hand {fig. 75.), of the lower jail) and the temporal bone {fig. 65.). Ligaments. Two or four ligaments. Motions. In four directions; viz. flexion, extension, abduction, and circum- duction, but no rotation. There are always two principal movements in these joints. 4. Trochlear Articulation, or Ginglymus. Characters. A mutual reception of the articular surfaces. The pulley or trochlea belongs to this mode of articulation. Examples : the elbow {figs. 71 and 72.) the knee {fig. 78.), thejoinU of the phalanges {figs. 73 and 74.). _ Ligaments. Two lateral ligaments always placed nearer the side ot flexion than that of extension. Motions. Two motions in opposite directions. 5. Trochoid Articulations, f Characters. An axis received into a ring, which is partly osseous, and : ?hl rr^lddlt'^I'^o S'^'Tot joint, corresponds to the simple or double lateral gingrAus o?modcrn^^nat^ or the rotatory d.arthrosis of the anc.c.U.CLASSIFICATION. 153 partly fibrous.

Articular surfaces, plane, or nearly so Examples : aHiculaiior,^ of the carpal and tarsal bones i figs. 75 and 84.), and of the articular processes of the vertebrce (^g,figs. 61 and 63.). , . Ligaments. Fibres placed irregularly round the joint. Motions. Gliding. II. Synarthroses. Characters. Articular stirfaces armed with teeth or other inequalities, -which are mutually dovetailed, and from which the name of suture is derived. Ex- amples : articulations of the bones of the cranium (figs. 21, 22, and 23.). Mea7is of union. Remnant of the cartilage of ossification, which is gradually encroached on during the progress of age.* There are no incrusting cartilages, synovial membranes, ligaments, nor mo- tions. Monro enumerates seven kinds of sutures, and these might still be multi- plied, if we regarded all the Varieties presented by the articular surfaces. Three kinds may be admitted with propriety: 1. indented sutures; 2. squamous su- tures; and 3. harmonic sutures; the distinctions depending upon the articular surfaces being provided with teeth, or overlapping like scales, or being simply rough and in juxtaposition. These even are only unimportant varieties. Monro added the schindylesis, or ploughshare articulation of Keil. We shall content ourselves with simply mentioning it; and we also omit the division gomphosis (y6iMpos, a nail), which is appropriated to the mode of implantation of the teeth; because the teeth are not bones, and are lodged in the jaw, not articulated with it. III. Amphiarthroses, or Symphyses. Characters. Flat, or nearly flat, articular surfaces, which are partly in con- tact, and are partly continuous by means of fibrous tissue. Examples: arti- culation of the bodies of the vertebra (b, fig. 58.), symphysis pubis (e, fig. 77.), sacro-iliac symphyses (fi,fig. 76.). Means of union. Interosseous and peripheral ligaments. Motion. Very slight, gliding; an arthrodia is a necessary element of an amphiarthrosis. Thus, in the symphysis pubis the bones are partly in contact, partly continuous.

The articulations of the vertebral column (figs. 58, 59, and 60.) are divided mto the extrinsic and the intrinsic. The first comprise the articulations of the vertebral column with the head, the ribs, and the ossa innominata. The in- trinsic comprise the articulations of the vertebraj with each other. These last are also divided into those which are common to all the vertebrae, and those which are peculiar to some. We shall describe each in succession. whn nffi^m!1f ""ejected this kind of articulation, adopting the opinion of Columbus, wno ainrms tliat there can be no joint where there is no motion.154 ARTHROLOGY. Articulations of the Vertebra with each other. Mode of preparation. Remove completely all the soft parts -which surround the vertebral column ; saw off vertically all that part of the head which is in front of the column, and separate the bodies of the vertebra from the posterior arches by dividing the pedicles. When the section reaches the axis, carry the instrument behind the superior articular processes of this vertebra, and of the atlas, and behind the condyles of the occipital bone : remove the spinal marrow and its membranes. In this way the vertebral column will be divided into two parts, — an anterior, formed by the series of the bodies of the vertebrae, on which we find the anterior and posterior common ligaments, and the interver- tebral substances; and a posterior, formed by the series of laminae, and the articular and spinous processes. The intervertebral substances require a spe- cial preparation, which consists in making vertical and horizontal sections of a portion of the column, or which may be more simply effected by maceration in diluted nitric acid, which allows the bodies of the vertebrae to be removed, without injuring the intervertebral substance. The vertebrae are united, 1. by their bodies; 2. by their articular processes; 3. by their laminae; and 4. by their spinous processes. Articulation of the Bodies of tH Vertebra. The bodies of the vertebrae are united together by amphiarihrosis. The ar- throdial portion, or the contiguous surface, is represented by the articular ^^^^he^articular surfaces are the upper and under surfaces of the body of each vertebra. It follows from the concavity of these surfaces, that, mstead of fit- ting each other exactly, they leave considerable lenticular spaces between them; these appear to be the vestiges of the biconical cavity between the ver- tebrae of fishes. The depth of these spaces is not the same throughout the entire column ; it exactly measures the thickness of the intervertebral sub- stance The articular surfaces are covered by a very thm layer of cartilage. The means of union are of two kinds, as in all the amphiarthroses :—1. they surround the joint; 2. they proceed from one articular surface to the other : in one word, some are peripheral, and the others interosseous. 1. Peripheral ligaments. The most general idea which can be formed of these ligaments is that of a fibrous sheath, surrounding the column formed by the bodies of the vertebrae, and uniting in one whole the different pieces of which it is composed. The part of the sheath which covers the anterior aspect ot the bones is called the anterior common ligament of the vertebra; and that which covers the Dosterior surface is called the posterior common ligament of the vertebra. The anterior common vertebral ligament (a, figs. 58. 60.) presents t^e appear- p. ance of a white pearly-lookmg membrane stretched from * " ' the axis to the upper part of the sacrum. This hga- ment, which is thicker in the dorsal region than in the neck or the loins, is composed of three very distinct : parts,—a thick one in the middle, and two lateral, which are separated from it by a series of openings that give passage to some vessels (see fig. 58 ). Its anterior sur- fhce is in contact with the organs of the neck, the tho- rax, and the abdomen, and united with them by very loose cellular tissue. The tendons of the longi colh and anterior recti muscles, and the pillars of the diaphragm, mix their fibres with this ligament. The psoaj muscles correspond to its lateral portions below, lis posterior 5^r/ai adheres more closely to the ^/tf^f te^'-^VSl stances, and to the projectmg rims of the bodies of the vertebra, than to the transverse grooves of the bodies This ligament is compref of'several planes of fibres, of which the mostARTICULATIONS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 155 superficial arc the longest. The deepest pass from one vertebra to the next, the superficial stretch over four or five vertebrae. ^x,- ^ , Posterior common vertebral ligament {a. Jig. 69.). This is thicker han the anterior, but has the same ^vhite pearly appearance. It commences at the occi- pital bone, and terminates at the sacrum. It resembles a fibrous band, which expands at the intervertebral sub- stances, and is contracted over the bodies of the vertebrae ; hence it has a regular festooned appearance. Its poste- rior surface is united to the dura mater at its upper part, but is separated from it by a delicate cellular tissue ~- throughout the rest of its extent. Its anterior surface ad- ■ heres intimately to the intervertebral substances; it is separated from the middle of the bodies of the vertebra by the veins, -which pass from the interior of the bone into the vertebral venous sinuses -which run along the edges of the ligament. Like the anterior common ver- tebral ligament, it is composed of several planes of fibres, the posterior of -which are the longest. It is formed of more compact tissue than the anterior. 2. The intervertebral substance or interosseous ligament {b,figs. 58, 59, 60. and 68.) consists of a kind of disc, -which fills up the lenticular space between the bodies of the vertebra, and might with propriety be called intervertebral disc. Each disc has the form of a double convex lens, and is so closely united by its upper and under surfaces to the corresponding vertebrae, that it is easier to break the bones than to destroy this connection. Its circumference adheres to the anterior and posterior common ligaments, and contributes to form the interver- tebral foramina. In the dorsal region it also fonns part of the angular facette which articulates with the ribs. The thickness of the intervertebral substance is not the same in all the regions of the spinal column, being greatest at the lower parts. The proportion between the thickness of the discs and the bodies of the vertebra; is not the same in all the regions. In the lumbar region the thickness of the disc is half that of the corresponding vertebrae ; in the dorsal region it is a third ; and in the cervical region it is a little more than a half. * The intervertebral substance is not equally thick throughout. From its lenticular form it must be thicker in the centre than at the circumference ; in the neck and in the loins it is thicker in front than behind ; in the back the opposite prevails, and by this inequality the discs concur in producing the al- ternate curves of the vertebral column. Abnormal curvatures are in a great measure caused by unequal thickness of these discs, and I have often had oppor- tunities to convince myself that compression of this substance on the side towards which the inclination takes place is the most common origin of the deformity. The thickness of the discs varies in different circumstances. Thus, after pro- longed standing in the erect posture, the height of the body becomes diminished from eight to ten lines, which is owing to compression of the intervertebral sub- stances. Each disc is composed of concentric layers 60. and 68.) closely pressed together at the circumference, but more separate towards the centre, where we find a soft spongy substance, moistened by a viscid fluid resembling synovia. This soft substance is nearer the posterior than the anterior aspect of the body of the vertebra; it escapes, and forms as it were, a heniia, when the parts are cut either horizontally or vertically. It varies much at different ages. It is moist, soft, spongy, and white in the infant and in youth, which accords -with the suppleness of the vertebral column at that period of life. At this time, also, we may inflate an irregular cellular cavity in it, which may be regarded as the rudiment of the large synovial cavity which these pans » A curious preparation may be m.ide, by taking away all the bodies of the vertebra; in a epuie softened by nitric acid. A column then remains, formed by the series of discs which may be compared with a column formed by the bodies of the vertebra;ARTHROLOGY. 156 exhibit in fishes. In old age it becomes dry, friable, and yellowish or brown. Monro attributes the elasticity of the vertebral column to the displacement of this soft central substance in the different movements ; for, according to his theory, the movements of the bodies of the vertebra; take place upon it as upon a moveable pivot or a liquid fulcrum. The intervertebral substance is called a cartilaginous ligament by Vesalius ; by others a cartilage ; and by Bichat afibro-cartilage; but they evidently belong to the fibrous tissues. This may be shown by macerating a portion of the spinal column for some days, or even by rubbing the surface with a rough cloth. It will then appear that this pretended fibro-cartUaga is nothing more than a series of concentric fibrous layers, strongly compressed together: that each layer is formed of parallel fibres, directed very obliquely from the lower surface of the vertebra above to the upper surface of the vertebra below, and regularly crossing with the fibres of the next layer (Jb', fig. 58.). This regular crossing, which we shall meet with in other parts, is evidently very conducive to solidity. Union of the Articular Processes. These articulations are arthrodice. Articular surfaces. The corresponding surfaces are covered by a thin layer of cartilage. The means of union consist of some irregular ligamentous fibres (rf d, fig. 60.), which surround the outside of the joint, and are more numerous in the dorsal and cervical regions than in the loins. These articu- lations are provided with synovial membranes of gi'eater extent in the cervical than in the other regions. Union of the Laminm. The spaces between the vertebral laminee are occupied by ligaments of a Fiif. 60. particular description, which are called yellow ligaments, liga- menta subflava, on account of their colour. They are com- posed of two halves united at an angle like the laminse (c c, fig. 60.). Their lower edge is implanted upon the upper edge of the laminse below, and their upper edge is attached to the anterior surface of the corresponding laminse. From this it follows, that the height of the ligamenta subflava is much greater than would be necessary to reach from one lamina to another ; it is abnost equal to that of the corresponding ver- tebral lamina. Their length is measured by that of the laminse, and is con- sequently greater in the neck than in the back and loins. They are of greater thickness in the loins than in the back and the neck, and the thickest part corresponds to the base of the spinous process. There are also some reinforcing bundles, which constitute a sort of median yellow ligament. Their anterior surface is separated from the dura mater by cellular tissue, and by veins. It is remarkable for its smooth and polished appearance Their posterior surfaces are in contact with the vertebral laminse, which cover them almost completely, except in the cervical region, where they mar be seen between the laminae, when the head is slightly mcUned forwards; this circumstance renders it possible for a penetrating instrument to enter between the cervical laminae, while it is almost mipossible m the dorsal and ^irac!are"°These ligaments are composed of paraUel vertical fibres very closelv arranged. They are extensible, and, when stretched, mimediately re- cover themselves, and are therefore very elastic They are as strong as or- dinary Ugaments. Their extensibdity is brought mto action during flexion of the virtebral column, and their elasticity during extension. They have great efi-ect in maintaining the erect posture, which would otherwise have le- quii-ed a constant expenditure of muscular power.ARTICULATIONS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 157 Union of the Spinous Processes. The spinous processes are united by the supra-spinous and the inter-spinous ligaments. The supraspinous ligament (dd, figs. 58 and 59.) is a fibrous cord, which extends from the seventh cervical vertebra to the sacrum, along the summit of the spinous processes of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrse. This ligament can be only distinguished from the aponeurotic fibres, which are in- serted into the spinous processes, by the longitudinal direction of its fibres. It is larger in the lumbar than in the dorsal region. It is expanded, and becomes even sometimes cartilaginous in the interval between the processes. It is inextensible. I regard a fibrous cord which extends from the seventh cervical vertebra to the external occipital protuberance, as a continuation of the supra-spinous ligament; it appears to be the vestige of the posterior cervical ligament of quadrupeds, and is of considerable size in some subjects; from its anterior surface, prolongations are given off to the spinous processes of all the cervical vertebrse, excepting the first. The inter-spinous ligaments (e e, fig. 58.) do not exist in the neck, where their place is supplied by small muscles; they are very thin in the back, where each has the fonn of a triangle with the base looking backwards. They are thick and quadrilateral in the loins. Their upper and lower edges are at- tached to the corresponding spinous processes. Their surfaces are in contact with the muscles of the vertebral grooves. M. Mayer speaks of synovial capsules, which he has met with between the lumbar spinous processes, and especially between the third and the fourth in this region; these membranes are by no means constant. Articulations peculiar to certain Vertebrce (Jigs. 61 to 64.). Although the articulations of the atlas and of the axis, with the occipital bone, belong to the external articulations of the vertebral column, yet the connection between these articulations and that of the atlas with the axis is so intimate, that it is impossible to separate them. We shall describe these three articulations in succession; first noticing the articulation of the atlas with the occipital bone {occipito-atlantoid articulation). Occipito-atlantoid Articulation. Preparation. Remove the part of the skull which is in front of the vertebral column, taking care to leave the basilar process. The muscles which sur- round the joint, being closely applied to the ligaments, should be very care- fully detached. The atlas unites with the occipital bone, 1. by its anterior arch ; 2. by its posterior arch; 3. by the base of its transverse processes; 4, by its two articular surfaces. 1. The anterior arch of the atlas is united to the circumference of the fo- ramen magnum by two anterior occipito-at- lantal ligaments. One of these, the superficial (a, figs. 61 and 64.) is a very strong cy- lindrical cord situated in the median line, where it forms a very marked projection, and stretches from the basilar process of the occi- pital bone to the anterior tubercle of the atlas. The other (b, fig. 61.),-which is deep-seated. is pretty thick, consists of several layers, and extends from the upper edge of the anterior arch of the atlas to the occipitiil 9 M hone. ^- Most anatomists admit the existence of a ligament stretching from the158 ARTHROLOGY. posterior part of the foramen magnum to the upper edge of the posterior arch of the atlas, the posterior occipito-allantal ligament (b, Jigs. 62 and 64.). But it can scarcely be distinguished, consisting only of a few ligamentous fibres among the fat of this region. 3. Lateral occipito-aiLantal ligaments (c,fig. 61.).

In connection with a similar bundle from the pars petrosa, it forms a very remarkable fibrous canal, which gives passage to the internal jugular vein the mternal carotid artery, the hypoglossal, pneumogastric, glosso-pharyngeal, and accessory nerves. 4. The union of the condyles of the occipital bone with the superior articular surfaces of the atlas is a double condyloid articulation. The articular surfaces of the occipital bone are the two condyles, convex, oblong, looking downwards and outwards, and directed forwards and inwards, so that their axes if pro- longed would meet in front of the basilar process. The aa-ticular surfaces of the atlas are concave and oblong, and look upwards and a little inwards, so as to fit exactly upon the convexity of the condyles. Both are covered by a thin layer of cartilage. The ligaments are vertical fibres which surround the joint, but are most numerous in front and on the outside, for they scarcely exist on the inside and behind. There is also a very loose synovial membrane which passes beyond the articular surfaces on all sides, but especially to the outside. Atlanto-axoid Articulation. Preparation. After having studied the superficial ligaments, remove the laminae of the axis, the posterior arch of the atlas, and the back part of the foramen magnum. Detach with care that portion of the dura mater which corresponds to the two first vertebrae and the foramen magnum, and turn it upwards. Lastly, in order to obtain a good view of the articulation of the odontoid process with the atlas, disarticulate the occipital bone. This articulation is formed between, l.the odontoid process of the axis, and the anterior arch of the atlas ; 2. between the superior articulating processes of the axis and the inferior articulating processes of the atlas ; 3. m addition, the anterior and posterior arches of the atlas are united to the axis by two ligaments — the anterior and the posterior atlanto-axoid ligaments. The anterior atlanto-axoid ligament (b,figs. 61 and 64.) is a thick vertical bundle composed of several layers, which extends from the tubercle and the lower edge of the anterior arch of the atlas in front of the base of the odontoid process of the body of the axis. It is continuous below with the anterior common ligament. , The posterior atlanto-axoid ligament (c, figs. 62 and 64.) is a very loose and thin meinbrane, extending from the posterior arch of the atlas to the upper edge of the laminae of the axis; it is a little thicker in the median hne than at the sides and represents the ligamenta subflava in a rudimentary state. AHiculation of the odontoid process with the atlas. This is a^.«o< join , the od^toidjrocesi being received into a ring formed m front by the anterior arch of the atlas, on the sides, by the lateral masses of the same bone, and hv the transverse ligament. We have therefore to consider, 1 the StSat?on St^e afch of the atlas with the odontoid process (a^Zanto- Td^n^S articulation); 2. the articulation of this same process with the trans- verse ligament (syndesmo-odontoid articulation).

Both surfaces are incrusted w.th car ,lage, and there is also a very loose synovial membrane v.ith subjacent adipose tissue^ The joint is strengthened by some ligamentous fibres, arranged in the form of ^ T%ndesmo-odontoid articulation. This joint is formed by means of the ^ ^ transverse or anmilar ligament (/, Jigs. bS and ' 64.), a ■^ery thick and compact bundle of fibres, flattened before and behind, and stretched transversely between the lateral masses of the atlas, passing behind the odon- toid process, and closely embracing it like a . half ring. The anterior surface of this liga- ment is concave, and polished like cartilage ; . ^ it is in contact with the posterior surface of the odontoid process (2, Jig. 64.), wHch is covered with cartilage, and is almost always furrowed transversely, i.e. in the direction of its movements. Ihere is a very loose synovial membrane in this joint, which is prolonged on the sides of the odontoid process, as far as the odontoid ligaments. The posterior surface is covered by the posterior occipito-axoid ligaments* (o,Jig. 64.; see Jigs. 63 and 64.). From its upper edge a fibrous band is detached, which is fixed to the occipital bone, in front of the occipito-axoid ligament, by a narrow extremity. Another fibrous band (see Jigs. 63 and 64.) of greater length than breadth proceeds from its lower edge, and is attached to the posterior surface of the axis; hence the name crucial has been given to the annular ligament by some authors. The extremities are inserted into two tubercles on the inside of the lateral masses of the atlas. There is a very remarkable circumstance connected with this ligament, viz. that its lower circumference belongs to a smaller circle than its upper, so that the odontoid process is very firmly retained in the ring which this ligament contributes to form, and this arrangement accords with a sort of constriction at the base of the odontoid process. Union of the Articular Processes of the Atlas and the Axis. This is a double arthrodia. The articular surfaces of the atlas are plane, circular, and horizontal, but looking slightly inwards; those of the axis are also plane and horizontal, looking slightly outwards, and of greater extent than the preceding. They are retained in their place by a fibrous capsule ( g, figs. 61. and 63.), which is very strong, especially in front, and sufiiciently loose to per- mit the extensive motions which take place at this joint: it is formed of vertical and parallel fibres. The synovial capsule is very loose, and projects beyond the surfaces of the bones in every direction, but particularly in front. It almost always communicates with the synovial membrane of the joint between the transverse ligament and the odontoid process. Union of the Occipital Bone and the Axis. Although the occipital bone and the axis are nowhere contiguous, and are not, therefore, articulated, yet they are imited very firmly by means of strong ligaments, extending from the occipital bone to the body of the axis, and also to the odontoid process. Preparation. Remove with care that portion of the dura mater which cor- responds to the first two vertebrae ; the occipito-axoid ligaments lie under it. Then detach the transverse ligaments, remove the anterior arch and lateral masses of the atlas, so that nothing remdns excepting the occipital bone and the axis. • If the student is only provided with one preparation for the examination of all these joints liRamenu""'^ to study these ligaments before dividing them, in order to expose the transverse160 ARTHROLOGY. 1. The nccipito-axoid ligaments are three in number, a middle and two lateral The middle occipilo-axoid ligament (p,fig. 64.) is thick, and forms at its upper part a single band, the fibres of which are separated below into three very distinct layers. The most posterior of these is continuous with the posterior common ligament; the second is attached to the posterior surface of the body of the axis ; and the deepest, which is very thin, and shaped like a tongue pointed above, is that which we described with the transverse ligament. The lateral occipito- axoid ligaments (r, jig. 64.) arise from the sides of the basilar groove by a broad extremity, and are attached to the posterior surface of the axis by a pointed end. They correspond in front with the odon- toid and transverse ligaments, and behind with the dura mater. 2. The odontoid ligaments are three in nimiber, a middle and two lateral. The middle (I, fig. 64.) consists of ligamentous fibres, which extend from the apex of the odontoid process to the fore part of the foramen magnum, between the condyles ; the two lateral {I, fig. 63.) are two bundles of fibres, very strong, short, and cylindrical, which stretch between the sides of the apex of the odontoid process, and two smaU fossee on the inside of the condyles; then- direction is horizontal, so that they represent the horizontal limbs of the letter T of which the odontoid process forms the vertical portion ; they are almost always united by a bundle, which passes above the odontoid process without adhering to it, so that, at first sight, they might be declared to be one and the same ligament. Sacro-vertebral, Sacro-coccygeal, and Coccygeal Articulations. Sacro-vertebral articulation. This resembles in every point the articulations of the other vertebra:. We shall only remark, 1. the great thickness of the intervertebral substance, particularly in front, a vertical section of it resem- bling a hatchet with the broad part turned forwards ; 2. the sacro-vertebral ligament (a, fig. 76.), which is proper to this articulation, a very short tluck, and strong bundle stretched obliquely from the transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra to the base of the sacrum, where it crosses with some liga- mentous fibres of the sacro-iliac articulation. . , . v • „„„ Sacro-coccygeal articulation.

The vertebral column being at once an enclosing and protecting cylinder for the spinal marrow, a column for transmitting the weight of the trunk and the upper extremities to the legs, and an organ of locomotion, its ana- tomical structure must be examined in reference to these three uses. The Vertebral Column considered as the protecting Cylinder of the Spinal Cord. The vertebral column performs the oflSce of a protecting cylinder, by virtue of its solidity, ensured by the bodies of the vertebra in front, by the projection of the spinous processes behind, which ward ofP, so to speak, all external ob- jects, and the prominence of the transverse processes at the sides. By means of these arrangements, the spinal cord is inaccessible, excepting by a sharp instrument, which might penetrate either in front through the inter- vertebral substances, or on the sides through the intervertebral foramina, or, lastly, behind through the intervals between the spinous processes, and between the laminae. Another condition of solidity is provided by the number of pieces of which the vertebral column is formed. For in all cases, where the column is subjected to shocks, each articulation becomes the seat of a de- composition of the force; a part is employed in producing a slight displace- ment of the articular surfaces, and is therefore entirely lost as far as regards the transmission of the shock. If, on the contrary, the vertebral column had been formed of one single piece, the transmission of shocks would have been unbroken, and thus the frequent cause of concussion and fracture. Lastly, the breadth of the articular surfaces by which the bodies are united, the strength and pliability of the intervertebral substances, the vertical direction of the articular processes, contrasted with the horizontal direction of the articular surfaces of the body, and the species of dove-tailing which results from it, are also most favourable conditions for the protection of the spinal marrow. The Vertebral Column, considered as an Organ for transmitting the Weight of the Trunk. The anatomical arrangements adapted to this purpose are the following: 1. The progressive increase in size of the vertebral column, from the apex to the base. This disposition is particularly observable in the first two pieces of the sacrum, which are proportionally much larger in man than in the lower animals. 2. The articulation of the vertebral column with the posterior part of the pelvis, by which the centre of gravity of the trunk is carried backwards, and the maintenance of the equilibrium is aided, by counter-balancing the weight of the thoracic and abdominal viscera, which, instead of uniformly surrounding the column, are all placed in front. 3. The alternate inflexions of the vertebral column, which allow more ex- tensive oscillations of the centre of gravity of the column, than would have been practicable had its direction been altogether rectilinear, and which also augment its power of resistance in the vertical direction. 4. The length of the spinous processes, which thus afford a more favourable, oecause a longer lever to the extensor muscles, which maintain the column A-K . absence of these processes in infancy is one of the causes of the difficulty of standing at that period.

It generally beheved, it .s true, that the diminution of height, which followsARTHROLOGY, 162 upon prolonged standing or walking, is the result of mechanical compression of the intervertebral discs, and an absolute diminution of their thickness ; but it appears more conformable to the laws of physics to admit, that the diminution in the height of the vertebral column depends upon the increase of the cur- vatures, unless we admit Monro's hypothesis of the absorption of part of the liquid contained within the discs. 6. The presence of the yellow ligaments, which by their elasticity con- tinually oppose the causes which tend to bend the body forwards, and which are for each of the vertebra what the posterior cervical ligament is for the head. 7. The existence of the vertebral canal, which has the same advantage as the cylinder of long bones, of increasing the strength without increasing the weight. 8. The mode of articulation of the vertebral column with the head, which is doubly advantageous, both as regards, the place occupied by the articular surfaces, and their direction : 1. The articular surfaces correspond to the point of junction of the posterior with the two anterior thirds of the head. The posterior third of the head contains a large portion of the encephalic mass, while the tvro anterior thirds are chiefly formed by the face, which, in com- parison to its size, is of little weight. From this it follows, that the weight of the posterior third almost counter-balances that of the two anterior thirds of the head. 2. The almost horizontal direction of the condyles in the human subject permits the head to rest upon the summit of the vertebral column, without having a necessary tendency, or at least a very slight one, to inclme forw^ards, as invariably takes place in animals whose occipital condyles are vertical, and situated entirely on the back of the head. Yet, notwithstanding these advantageous conditions of the atlantal articulation, the part in front of the condyles is somewhat heavier than that behind ; and this difference, though slight, is sufficient to cause flexion of the head, when left to itself, either during sleep or after death. The Vertebral Column considered as an Organ of Locomotion. The vertebrge perform upon each other certain oscillatory or balancing movements in all directions, by means of the pliability of the intervertebral substances*; but they are so obscure, that their existence can scarcely be re- cognised, or their character examined on a small portion of the column. In order to understand them, the entire spine must be examined. Movements of the entire column. These are, 1. Flexion, or the movement for- wards: 2. Extension; 3. Lateral incUnation; 4. Circumduction, m which tne column describes a cone, of which the apex is below, and the base above; 5. Rotation on its axis, or torsion of the vertebral column. In the analysis of the motions of the column, it is necessary to distinguisn carefully between the actual and the apparent motions; the first are much less extensive than would be imagined at first sight, the greater part of the ap- parent movements taking place at the articulations of the pelvis with the thiffhs In these movements of the whole, the column represents a lever ot the third order, an elastic arch in which the resistance is at the upper ex- remi^, the fulcrum at the lower end, and the power apphed m the middle^ Eadi v;rtebra, on the contrary, represents a lever of the first order, in which the power and the resistance are at the anterior and posterior extremities of *n'rrl—.7?.Sol!^^^^^^^ most extensive of all, the anterior commt 7gam:nt is rflfxed; the anterior part f J« j/.^^^^^^^^^^ U romnressed- the soft central portion is pushed backwards; the posterior fi^rTo^th: discs are slightly sWched, as are ^->^XC^r T~ ligament, the supra-spinous, inter-spmous, and yellow ligaments.

The laminse are separated, so that the rachidian canal, especiaUy in the cervical region, becomes accessible to penetrating instruments. • 2. In extension, the anterior common ligament and the anterior fibres of the intervertebral discs are stretched; the posterior fibres of the disc are relaxed; the soft central matter is pushed forwards; the yellow, supra-spinous, and inter-spinous ligaments are relaxed. The lower articular processes glide downwards upon the superior articular processes of the vertebra below. This motion is not extensive; it is limited by the anterior common ligament, and the meeting of the spinous processes. 3. In the movements of lateral inclination, the discs are compressed on the side to which the inclination takes place, and the central pulp is forced to the other side. These motions are limited, not only by the meeting of the trans- verse processes, but even before these touch, by the resistance of the inter- vertebral substances, and of the lateral bundles of the anterior common ligament. 4. Circumduction. This motion, the centre of which is in the lumbar region, appears at first sight very extensive, because a portion of the movement at the hip joint is generally ascribed to it. In reality, it is very limited, and re- sults from a succession of the preceding motions. 5. The movement of rotation is effected by the twisting of the intervertebral substances. Although the motion of each disc is very slight, yet the simul- taneous twisting of them all produces a general movement, by which the an- terior surface of the column is turned slightly to the sides. It is however, upon the whole, very limited; and although in the erect posture the trunk of the body can describe a semicircle, the greater part of this motion takes place at the hip-joint. All the regions of the vertebral column do not equally participate in these general motions. They are most extensive in the cervical region, where we observe, 1. flexion, which may be carried so far as to make the chin touch the upper part of the sternum; 2. extension, so that the neck may be turned back- wards ; 3. lateral inclination, until the head nearly touches the shoulder; 4. rotation, which is greater here than in any of the other regions, notwith- standing the presence of the lateral hook-like processes or ridges. * These- motions may be to such an extent as to cause luxation, which can only take place, without fracture, in the cervical region, on account of the almost hori- zontal direction of the articular processes. The general movements are most limited in the dorsal region. 1. Flexion is rendered impossible by the presence of the sternum. The presence of this bone in the different species of animals attests the immobDity of the dorsal portion of the column, in the same manner as its absence is an indication of its mobUity. 2. Extension is prevented by the meeting of the spinous processes, which are longer and more closely imbricated in this than in any other of the regions. 3. Lateral movements are rendered impossible by the ribs, which would be forced against each other if this motion took place. 4. As all the preceding motions are the elements of circumduction, it may be easily conceived that this can scarcely take place. 5. The same obstacles oppose the movement of rotation, which is also prevented by the position of the articular processes, which are directed vertically, and whose surfaces on the right and left sides are not upon the same plane. The thinness of the intervertebral substances in Wh"^^ '■egion accords with all these arrangements in limiting mobility. What has been said regarding the immobility of the dorsal region applies only to the upper part of this region.

"We know, that the two last dorsal vertebrae are remarkable for the shortness of their spinous and transverse processes; and that the ribs with which they articulate are very moveable, and could not oppose the motions of the vertebrse in any degree. The lumbar region participates much more in the general motions than the dorsal. The articular processes in this region are much more advantageously adapted for rotation than in either the dorsal or cervical, for the lower pair of each vertebra forms a solid cylinder, which is received into the hollow surface of the superior articulating processes of the vertebra below. This arrange- ment permits a motion resembling that of the hinges of a door. It should be remarked, that in all the regions the lower articular processes of each vertebra are placed behind the superior articular processes of the succeeding vertebra, and form a sort of imbrication. Each vertebra then is retained in its place by a species of dove-tailing, so that it cannot be dis- located forwards, without breaking the superior articular processes of the vertebra below, nor backwards, without breaking the inferior articular pro- cesses of the vertebra above. This remark does not apply rigorously to the cervical region, the articular processes of which are obUque, and can permit dislocation without fracture. Mechanism of the Articulations of the Vertebral Column and the Head. The movements of the head upon the vertebral column are shared between two articulations: viz. 1. the occipito-atlantal, to which all the J^otions of flexion, extension, lateral inclination, and circumduction belong; 2. the at- lanto-axoid, which only performs one movement, viz. rotation. Mechanism of the Occipito-atlantal Articulation. The movements of flexion and extension of the head upon the atlas are very Umited when the head is decidedly bent or inclined, the elFect is produced by inn o7the whole cervical region. It is possible to distmguish flexion at Te occipito a^^^^^^ articulation from that which is produced by the entire cervical region.

In this motion, in which the head describes the arc of a large circle upon the vertebral column, the syndesmo- atlantal ring turns upon the axis as a wheel upon its axle. Of the two plane surfaces of this joint, one glides forwards, and the other backwards • one of the odontoid ligaments is stretched, and the other relaxed. These ligaments, it should be observed, limit the extent of rotation ; but their resistance is oc- casionally insufficient, and the odontoid process breaking one of them slips below the transverse ligament, and occasions death by compressing the spinal cord. Luxation, therefore, of this articulation is to be dreaded, not merely for the same reasons as other dislocations, but as being a cause of compression of the spinal marrow. The entire movement by which the face is turned to either side should not be attributed to this articulation alone, for it extends to the fourth of a circle on each side, and such a degi'ee of motion would dislocate the articular surfaces of the atlas and the axis. Articui/Ations of the Cranium. All the bones of the cranium are united together by synaithroses. We have here to examine, as in all other articulations, L the articular surfaces ; 2. the means of union. As the bones of the cranium form a complete cavity, closed in every direction, they unite by their entire circumferences or by their edges : and as the solidity of joints is in a direct ratio to the extent of the ar- ticular surfaces, the bones of the cranium, which are only in contact by their edges, would have been very slightly connected, had it not been for the follow- ing provisions : 1. The cranial bones are generally thicker at the circumference than in the centre ; 2. They are almost all provided with marginal denticula- tions that multiply the points of contact; 3. The edges, instead of being cut perpendicularly, are bevelled so as to overlap each other, and thereby present much more extensive corresponding surfaces; 4. "We should observe, also, the number of projectmg and retreating angles that are formed by these bones ; and 5. the sinuous arrangement of their edges. We should remark, however, that these different modes of ensuring solidity are not employed indiscriminately over the whole skull. In the vaidt of the cranium, for example, firmness is attained by the mutual adaptation of the serrated margins of the bones at the upper and at the back paits, and by their overlappmg at the sides ; in the base, on the contrary, the solidity chiefly de- pends upon the breadth of the contiguous surfaces, and upon the reception of projectmg mto corresponding retreating angles. Examples of this double arrangement may be seefl in the articulation of the occipital and sphenoid bones, which is accompHshed by means of broad surfaces, and in the articula- tion of the projectmg angle formed by the petrous portion of the temporal bone with the retreatmg angle formed by the occipital bone behind, and the sphenoid in front. *^ This description will suffice to give a general idea of the mode of union between the bones of the cranium. It would evidently exceed the limits of tins work to dilate upon the form of each of the sutures and to follow Munro, m distinguishing fourteen or fifteen different kinds.

We must also observe, 1. with regard to the sutures, that their indentations are much deeper on the external than on the internal surface of the bones of the cranium ; 2. with regard to those sutures which are bevelled, that they often present alternate oblique sections having opposite di- rections, so that of two bones the one that overlaps the other at one part of the suture is at another part itself overlapped: of this we have an example in the fronto-parietal suture. Means of Union of the Bones of the Cranium. We have remarked, in speaking of the development of the bones, that those which are subsequently united by immoveable articulations are formed in a piece of cartilage that is common to them all. Portions of this cartilage, not yet encroached upon by ossification, serve as the uniting media. It is evident, therefore, that these cartilages of the sutures are broader when the amount of ossification is less, viz. in the earlier periods of life. The pericranium on the outside, and the dura mater on the inside, contribute also to strengthen the union of the bones of the cranium. Mechanism of the Cranium. What has been said above of the immobility of the bones of the cranium is not equally true at all periods of life. During foetal existence, and the first few years after birth, the intervals between the bones of the cranium are oc- cupied by a flexible cartilaginous substance, which permits those of the roof to move pretty extensively upon each other. Since, therefore, the conditions of solidity are not the same at this period as in the adult, we must examine the mechanism of the cranium both in the foetus and in the adult. 1. In the foetus the conditions of solidity must be studied both in the roof and in the base of the cranium. In the roof of the cranium the incomplete ossification allows the bones to move upon each other, and in this respect the encephalon is imperfectly pro- tected. But on the other hand, the presence of these cartilaginous intervals diminishes the momentum of a violent force applied to the cranium, and thus prevents, in some degree, both fractures of the cranium and concussions of the brain. The mobility of the bones is principally displayed at birth, in their overlapping when the head of the foetus is passing through the pelvis. The base of the cranium is incompressible at the same period, and the bones are immoveable, because ossification has so far advanced, that they are only sepa- rated by very thin layers of cartilage. This arrangement is well adapted for the protection of the most important parts of the encephalon, which are m the vicinity of the base of the cranium. 2. In the adult the roof and the base of the cranium form one piece. Ihe roof being most exposed to violence, we shall examine the mechanism of re- sistance in the cranium to blows directed vertically upon the top of the head ; and it wiU be easy to anply what is said in explanation of the effects of a force so directed to cases in "which violence is applied in other directions. The effects which may be presumed to follow a violent blow on the top ot the skuU are 1. Concussion of its bony parietes, succeeded by their elastic reaction • 2. Disiunction of the pieces entering into the formation of the skull; and 3. Fracture of those pieces. We shall examine the method m which these results may be produced. . ■, ^ , m, 1. Concussion and compression of the cranium without fracture. The cranium may be looked upon as a hollow sphere, endowed with a certain degree of elas- ticity, depending partly upon the osseous tissue itself, and partly upon the car- tilaginous lamini; which separate the bones; and it cannot, therefore, be doubtedARTICULATIONS OF THE CRANIUM. 167 M 4 that from pressure, or violent blows on the top of the head, the skull may un- dergo a flattening, and then recover its original condition, like a hollow ball of ivory when struck vertically.^ The truth of this explanation may be shown at once by projecting a skull against a resisting surface, when it will be found to rebound like an elastic ball. However slight this flattening may be, and the recovery which follows it, the known laws of physics will not allow us to deny its possibility. 2. Tendency to disjunction of the bones of the cranium. This separation has never been observed as the consequence of external blows. The following is the manner in which displacement is prevented in cases of blows on the top of the head. It is evident that violence applied in this direction would have a tendency to depress the upper edge of the parietal bones; but this cannot take place without forcing the lower edge outwards: and as from the peculiar for- mation of the squamous suture the parietal bones are overlapped by the tem- poral and the sphenoid, this edge cannot be driven outwards without giving the temporal bones such a motion as will tighten the articulations of the base of the cranium. AU these articulations are remarkable in this respect, that the projecting angles of some of the bones are received into the retiring angles of others. This is exemplified in the articulation of the petrous portion of the temporal bone with the sphenoid and the occipital bone, and in the basilar process of the occipital bone with the two temporals and the sphenoid. The result of all these arrangements is, that blows upon the top of the head, instead of separating the bones of the cranium, tend to render their union still closer. 3. Another eifect of blows on the top of the head may be fracture of the cranial bones ; and it will be impossible to comprehend the nature of many of these fractures, without a knowledge of the following points of structure: 1. The cranium is of unequal thickness in different parts. This circumstance explains how a round body, striking the cranium in a spot of sufficient strength to resist the impulse, may cause a fracture of a more or less distant part, where the parietes are thinner and consequently weaker. It may be conceived, that this kind of fracture may take place either in the bone struck, or in other bones, and that it may affect the internal table only, the external remaining uninjured. 2. The cranium is so constructed, that a shock impressed upon the top is con- centrated at the base, being propagated on the sides to the temporal bones and their petrous portions, as well as to the great wings of the sphenoid and the body of that bone ; behind, by the occipital bone to the basilar process and the body of the sphenoid ; and in front, by the frontal bone and the roof of the orbits, to the smaller wings and body of the sphenoid. It will thus be seen how blows upon various parts of the skull may concentrate their effects upon the base of the cranium ; and this explains the production of fractures at the base, m consequence of violence inflicted on the roof of the skull. 3. Most of the cranial bones are bent and angular. This disposition which is ob- served at the union of the orbital and frontal portions of the frontal bone, and at the junction of the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bone, explains how these bones may be broken by the transmission of shocks from thereof. For we may conceive, when violence is applied to a bone which is bent at an angle, that this angle will be the seat of a decomposition of the torce, one portion of which is transmitted to the part of the bone below the angle, whilst the remaining portion acts against the angle itself in the original A^^l°°' ^"^^ determine a fracture of that part of the bone. Although the roof of the cranium is most exposed to injury, yet some parts ot the base may be reached by penetrating weapons, as the roof of the orbits ana the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. It should be remarked, also, that these are the thinnest parts of the skull.ARTHROLOGY. 168 ARTICCUiVTIONS OF THE FACE. The articulations of the face comprise those of the upper and of the lower jaw. Articulations of the Bones of the Superior Maxilla with each other, and with the Cranium. All these articulations are sutures, but they have not such large indentations as the bones of the cranium ; almost aU are united by harmoma or ]uxta-po- sition At the same time it should be remarked that a true dovetaihng exists in these articulations, as may be seen in the junction of the superior maxiUary boups (the fundamental articulation of the face), which is effected by means of thick furrowed surfaces, mutually and firmly adapted to eaoh other. No suture in the whole skull is stronger than that between the malar and tbP maxiUarv bones ; indented sutures are most common on the sides of the face The manner in which the vertical portion of the palate bone is re- ceived into the furrow in the opening of the maxiUary smus, affords an Ulus- tratTon of the suture by reception. There are some weU-marked indentations n he articulations of the bones of the face with those of the cramum ; as m the articulation of the nasal bones of the ascending processes of the superior mai and of the malar bones with the frontal; in that of the sphenoid with the'malar bones ; and of the latter with the zygomatic processes of he remooral bones. Simple juxta-position is met with m the junction of the etW d\.?th the roof of the orbit; of the palate bone with the P erygoid pro- ceSs ; and of the vomer with the ethmoid; but there is a mutual reception in t>,o nrtSpuIation of the vomer with the sphenoid. ™ reS to the means of miion, in addition to the firm muon resultmg from Ihe configuration of the articular surfeces, there is also a thin layer of irmSe contS^ous with that which fonned the matrix of the bones, and which is itS afterwards obliterated during the progress of ossification.

These columns, which correspond to the second great molar teeth, may be called the zygomato-jugal, because they are subdi- vided into two other secondary columns, the vertical, malar, or jugal and the horizontal or zygomatic. The jugal columns are much stronger than the fronto- nasal, and are continuous with the external orbital processes of the frontal bone, and with the anterior thick and indented edges of the great wings of the sphenoid: the second, or horizontal, articulate with the zygomatic pro- cesses of the temporal bones, and with them constitute the zygomatic arches. From this arrangement it may be understood, how effectually the bevelling of the end of the zygomatic process that rests upon the malar bone, is adapted for resisting impulses communicated from below. The zygomatic arches, also, form props that oppose all transverse displacements. The mode of articulation of the zygomatic processes with the malar bones is such, that the zygomatic arches, although horizontal, are well calculated to resist any force from below. In camivora, where there are no jugal columns, the zygomatic arches are enor- mously large. The fourth pair of columns are the pterygoid, intended to support the face in the antero-posterior direction: being articulated with the maxillary bones, through the medium of the palate bones, these also oppose any displace- ment upwards, and, moreover, serve to support the back part of the alveolar border. There are, therefore, four pairs of columns; viz. the fronto-nasal, the jugal, the zygomatic arches, and the pterygoid columns. Thej are Eilmost entirely com- posed of compact tissue. The principal columns are situated immediately above the first great molares, where the jugal, zygomatic, and pterygoid co- lumns are concentred, and where the most violent impulses are received. The fronto-nasal columns correspond to the canine teeth; their strength is propor- tioned to that of these teeth, and hence in carnivorous animals the ascending processes of the superior maxiUa! are very large and thick. The fronto-nasal and jugal columns are near each ctther below, and only leave a small space between them, which is occupied by the two small molares; but they are sepa- rated to a considerable distance above, and enclose the orbital fossse. In this manner the deep fossae in the face are formed without being preju- dicial to its strength. Even the maxillary sinus does not much diminish the solidity of the face, because it is situated in the interval between the columns, and because only a small portion of it corresponds to the alveolar border. These details will suffice to show, that the upper jaw has been framed to resist external impulses, but especially forces communicated from below by the lower jaw ; that the alveolar border, being intended to receive the impulse directly, is most strongly constructed; that the whole force applied to the upper jaw is transmitted by the fronto-nasal columns to the internal orbital processes, by the malar colmnns, partly to the external orbital processes, and partly to the zygomatic arches, and by the palate bone to the pterygoid columns of the sphenoid; that the vomer transmits little or nothing either to the ethmoid or the sphenoid; and that the cranium, on its part, opposes very unyielding structures to the sustaining pillars of the face. To forces directed from before backwards, the zygomatic arches and the pterygoid pro- cesses offer great resistance; against lateral violence each malar bone resists hke an arch, and transmits the impulse it has received to the superior maxillary bone, the frontal and the sphenoid. The greatest part of the impulses com- municated to the face are then ultimately transmitted to the cranium; and were it not for the multiplicity of its constituent parts, and the great number '^fJ'<''ilations which absorb part of the force, the brain contained within it would be frequently exposed to dangerous violence. The upper jaw is con- cerned m the process of mastication merely as a means of support; for though It may be raised when the mouth is opened, and depressed when the mouth Ls170 ARTHROLOGY. shut, these mo-vements belong to the entire head, and result from the action of its extensor muscles, which thus become powerful auxiliaries of mastication in the carnivorous animals. Temporo-maxillary Articulation (Jigs. 65, 66, and 67.). This joint, the centre of all the movements of the lower jaw, is a double condyloid articulation. The articular surfaces are, I. the two condyles of the lower jaw, transversely oblong, and directed somewhat obliquely inwards and backwards, so that their axis if prolonged would intersect behind: 2. the glenoid cavity of each temporal bone, and the transverse root of its zygomatic p'-ocess. These surfaces are covered with cartilage. The glenoid cavity is remarkable, both for its depth and its capacity. Its depth is increased by several eminences on its borders ; viz. on the inside, by the spine of the sphenoid ; and behind, by the styloid and the vaginal processes, the latter of which is nothing more than the anterior lamina of the auditory meatus. The capacity of the glenoid cavity is no less remarkable, being double or triple that which would be necessary to receive the condyle ; more- over the whole of this cavity is not articular, the part situated behind the gle- noidal fissure being extraneous to the joint. This disproportion between the cavity and the condyle is only observed in man and in ruminantia: in ro- dentia and carnivora, the one is exactly proportioned to the other. The por- tion of the glenoid cavity posterior to the fissure affords an example of those supplementary cavities that in certain circumstances increase or replace the principal cavity. All that part of the glenoid cavity situated anteriorly to the fissure, belongs to the joint, and is therefore covered with cartilage.* The transverse root of the zygoma, convex from before backwards, and con- cave transversely, is also articular, and covered by a cartilage, which is a con- tmuation of that lining the glenoid cavity. This articulation presents the only example in the body of two convex surfaces moving upon each other. The means by which motion is facilitated, and union maintained in this ar- ticulation, are an inter-articular cartilage,' an external lateral ligament, and two synovial membranes; the internal lateral ligament of some authors, and the stylo-maxillary ligament, do not belong to this joint. 1. Inter-articular cartilage (a, Jig 65.). This cartilage is interposed between ; ^. the articular surfaces; it is thick at the cir- * cumference, and sometimes perforated at the centre, and resembles a bi-concave lens, with this peculiarity, that its upper surface is alter- nately convex and concave to correspond with the glenoid cavity and the transverse root of the zygoma, while the lower surface is concave and adapted to the condyle. Its circumference is free, excepting on the out- side, where it adheres to the external lateral lieament, and on the inside where it gives attachment to some fibres of the ex- ernTl p ^rygoid muscle. This circumstance is of great importanpe in regard o the Sechfnism of the joint. The existence of an inter-art.cular cartilage t wMch is subjected to such considerable pressure, and is so^ften pu in motion, agrees with the general law already pointed out. (Vide The Abti ^TSr/™%L.. 66.). This ligament extends fn,m the .

Fig. 66. tubercle situated at the junction of the two roots of the zygoma to the out- side of the neck of the condyle : it is directed obliquely downwards and backwards, and forms a thick band covering the whole of the outside of the articulation: it is in con- tact with the skin externally, and internally with the two synovial capsules and the inter- articular cartilage. Anatomists have described under the name of the internal lateral or spheno-max- iUarij ligament (c, fig. 67.) an aponeurotic band, which neither as regards its position or its use, can be considered as properly belonging to the joint; it is extended from the spinous process of the sphenoid, to the spine situated on the in- side of the orifice of the inferior dental canal. It is a very thin band which covers the inferior dental vessels and nerves, and separates them from the pterygoid muscles. Since the band just described has no effect in giving strength to the joint, it may be wondered that there is only one ligament for the articulation; but it should be observed that, as the lower jaw is articulated in the same manner at both its extremities, the ex- ternal lateral ligament of the one exactly performs the functions of an internal lateral ligament to the other. The stylo-maxillary ligament (d,figs. 65, 66, and 67.) appears to me to hold the same place as the preceding; it is a fibrous band extending from the sty- loid process to the angle of the inferior maxilla. It has no relation to the union of the articular surfaces. Its use appears to be that of giving attachment to the stylo-glossus muscle ; Meckel calls it the stylo-mylo-hyoid ligament. 3. There are two synovial capsules in this joint, one on the upper, and the other on the lower surface of the inter-articular cartilage {see fig. 65.). Some- times they communicate by an opening in the cartilage ; the superior is looser than the inferior; and thus the articular cartilage is more closely united to the condyle of the lower jaw than to the glenoid cavity. These two synovial capsules are in contact on the outside with the external lateral ligament, and elsewhere with a thin layer of fibrous tissue. Mechanism of the Temporo-maxillary Articulation. In considering the action of this joint, the lower maxilla may be regarded as a hammer which strikes against the anvU represented by the upper jaw; it is a double angular lever, the axis of its motion being represented by a hori- zontal line that would pass through the middle of the rami. This articulation, which belongs to the class of condyloid joints, has been ranged among the angular ginglymi, on account of the great extent of its movements in two op- posite directions, during its elevation and its depression, but it differs from them in being so constructed as to admit of slight lateral movements. It can also be moved forwards and backwards. 1. Depression. In this movement each condyle rolls forwards in its glenoid cavity, and then passes upon the transverse root of the zygoma, with a sudden jerk, which may be easily felt by placing the finger on the condyle whilst the mouth is being opened, at the same time the angle of the jaw is moved back- wards. The condyle carries with it the inter-articular cartilage; for the union of these two parts is of such a nature that, even in dislocation of the jaw, they are never separated. This dep<mds not only upon the comparative tightness of the lower synovial capsule, but also on the mode of insertion of the external pterygoid muscle, which being attached both to the neck of the condyle andARTHROLOGY. 172 the inter-articular cartilage, acts simultaneously upon them. The other parts of the joint are affected in the folio-wing manner :—during depression of the lower jaw, the exiernal lateral ligament is stretched ; the upper synovial cap- sule is distended behind, but readily yields on account of its laxity. The spheno-maxillary hand, or internal lateral ligament, which is inserted at an almost equal distance from the condyle which is carried forwards, and from the angle of the jaw which is carried backwards, remains unaltered, being neither stretched nor relaxed. When the depression is carried too far, either from the effect of a blow upon the bone, or during a convulsive yawn, the condyle is dislocated into the zygomatic fossae, tearing the supesior synovial capsule, and carrying with it the inter-articular cartilage.* This mode of displacement is impossible in the infant, for from the obliqiiity of the ascending ramus of the jaw the upper part of the condyle looks backwards, and in order to be luxated forwards would have to traverse a much larger space than it does even when the mouth is opened to the greatest possible extent. 2. In elevation, the condyle rolls backwards upon the transverse process into the glenoid cavity. The external lateral ligament is relaxed. The obstacles to too great an elevation are, 1. The meeting of the dental arches; 2. The presence of the vaginal process, and the anterior wall of the auditory meatus ; and it is very probable that the extensive movements of the jaw in the old subject when the teeth are lost, arc permitted by the size of the glenoid cavities. Without that portion of the glenoid cavity which is behind the fissm-e of Glas- serus, the toothless alveolar edges of the aged could never be brought in con- tact. . The forward motion is not, like the preceding, the motion of a lever m which the jaw turns upon its axis ; it is a horizontal movement in which the condyle is brought under the transverse root of the zygoma. A preliminary and in- dispensable condition to this movement is a slight depression of the whole of the lower maxilla. In this movement all the ligaments are stretched; if it were carried too far, the coronoid process would strike against the bone in the zygomatic fossa, and this circumstance would prevent the possibility of luxation of the condyle. The backward motion requires no special remark. The lateral movements differ from the preceding in the mechanism by which they are effected. In the first place, the whole bone does not move from its place. One of the condyles alone escapes from its socket, while the other re- mains in the glenoid cavity. The bone, therefore, turns upon one of the con- dyles as on a pivot. _ . , . , j i The external lateral Ugament of that articulation in which the condyle moves is much stretched. . ^ .i, The lateral motions would have been much more extensive, had not the two condyles mutually obstructed each other, in aU movements but that of de- pression, by reason of their opposite directions. This may be shown by sawing a maxilla through the middle, and moving each of the halves. Moreover the styloid and vaginal processes and the spine of the sphenoid prevent displace- ment inwards. Articitlations of the Thorax. The articulations of the thorax comprehend, 1. the costo-vertebral articula- tions; 2.thechondro-stemal; 3. the articulations of the cartilages of the nbs with each other ; 4. the junction of the cartilages and the nbs. « This luxition would be much more cnmmor were it not for the inter-articular cartilage whici by afways Tccompiiying the condyle, presents a smooth surface, over which the latter may glide in returning into its proper cavity.173 COSTO-VERTEBRAL ARTICULATIONS. The Coslo-vertebral Articulations (Jigs. 58. to 60. and 68.). Preparation. Saw the ribs across at their posterior angles. Remove with care the pleura and the subjacent ceUular tissue in front, and the muscles of the vertebral grooves behind. After having studied the superficial bgaments, expose, l.thecosto-transverse interosseous Ugament by a horizontal section of the rib, and the transverse process to which it is attached2. the costo- vertebral mterosseous ligament by a similar horizontal section, including one vertebra and one rib, and passing above the angular part of the JO™*- ^^'^^ last ligament may be also exposed by a, vertical section of the rib and the two vertebra with which it is connected. The costo-vertebral articulations have some characters which are common to them aU, and others that are peculiar to a few. General Characters of the Costo-vertebral Articulations. Articular surfaces. In this joint the head of the rib is applied to the angular surface formed by the two half facettes (f f',fig. 58.) upon the sides of the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae, so that each rib is articulated with two vertebrae (jcosto-vertebral articulation, properly so called) ; and in addition, the tubercle of the rib is apphed to the facette (g,fiys. 58. 60. and 68.) on the fore-part of the transverse process (costo-transverse articulation). With regard to the costo-vertebral articulation, it is to be remarked, 1. that it affords an example of a projecting angular facette received into a retreating angular facette, which has given rise to the mistaken notion that this joint is an angular ginglymus ; and 2. that in each articulation the lower half facette is twice as large as the upper. The surfaces of the costo-transverse articulation are, a convex facette be- longing to the tubercle of the rib, and a concave one belonging to the trans- verse process. Sabatier affirms that the articular surfaces of the transverse processes look forwards and upwards in the upper vertebras, and forwards and downwards in the lower, and directly forwards in those which occupy the middle of the column. This arrangement has been referred to in explanation of the mechanism of the dilatation of the thorax, by depression of the lower, and elevation of the upper ribs ; but tliis explanation is unfounded. In addition to the costo-vertebral and costo-transverse articulations, the neck of the rib (c,fig. 68.), without being in immediate contact with the trans- verse process, is in some degree united with it by symphysis. Means of union. These joints are examples both of symphysis and ar- throdia. Some of the ligaments are external to the articulation, the remainder are interosseous. 77ie ligaments external to the articulation are, the anterior costo-vertebral or stellate ligament, the superior and the inferior ligamentS; the posterior costo- transverse, and the superior costo-transverse. I. Tlie anterior costo-vertebral, or stellate ligament Q,fig. 58.) arises from the two vertebrae with which the rib is connected, and from the corresponding in- tervertebral substance. From these points its fibres converge, and are inserted in front of the extremity of the rib. 2 and 3. Besides the stellate ligament there are two small ligamentous bundles, a superior and an inferior, which extend from each of the vertebrae concurring to form the articulation, to the extremity of the rib. 4. The posterior costo-transverse ligament {m,fig. 59. transverse ligament of Beyer, posterior costo-transverse ligament of Bichat) is a fibrous band stretched from the apex of the transverse process in an oblique direction to the non-ar- ticular portion of the tubercle of the rib. 5. The superior costo-transver.ie ligament figs. 58, 59. costo-transverse of iioycr, infmor costo-transverse of Bichat) consists of a band, which arises from .ir*''' !^^?*'.''^^^. t'^'^ns^erse process, passes obliquely, and is inserted, not into the rib, which articulates with tnat process, but into the upper edge of the174 ARTHROLOGY. neck of the rib below. At the place of this insertion, -we always find a crest or spine. This ligament is sometimes divided into two or three bundles; it forms the continuation of a thin aponeurosis, which covers the external in- tercostal muscle, and completes the external wall of the opening through which the posterior branches of the intercostal vessels and nerves are transmitted- This ligament is interposed between the anterior and posterior branches of these vessels and nerves. The interosseous ligaments are two in number. I. A costo-vertebral interos- seous ; 2. A costo-transverse interosseous. 1. The costo-vertebral interosseous ligament {o,fig. 58.) is a small bundle of fibres, very short and very thin, extending horizontally from the projecting angle on the head of the rib to the retreating angle of the vertebral facette, where it is continuous with the intervertebral substance. 2. The costo-transverse interosseous ligament (a. Jig. 68.) is formed by some Fig. 68 ligamentous bundles intermixed with reddish adi- pose tissue, which stretch from the anterior surface of the transverse process to the posterior surface of the neck of the rib. An idea of the strength of this ligament may be formed by attempting to separate the rib from the transverse process, after the anterior costo-vertebral and the posterior costo- transverse ligaments have been divided. There are three synovial capsules in the articulations of the ribs with the vertebrse, — one between the tuberosity and the transverse process, and two small ones for the two surfaces which are separated by the costo-vertebral in- terosseous ligament. Characters peculiar to certain Costo-vertebral Articulations. The articulations of the first, eleventh, and twelfth ribs alone present pecu- liarities. 1. Costo-vertebral articulation of the first rib. The rounded head of the first rib is received into a cavity on the side of the body of the first dorsal vertebra; the articulation is therefore a species of enarthrosis ; there is neither acosto-ver- tebral interosseous ligament, nor a superior costo-transverse ligament: the syn- ovial membrane is much looser than in the corresponding articulations. 2. The costo-vertebral articulations of the eleventh and twelfth ribs present the same characters as the preceding in this respect, that the articular cavity for the head of the bone is situated upon one vertebra alone. The head of the rib is flattened, or very slightly convex ; and there is no interosseous costo-vertebral ligament. The superior costo-transverse ligament is much broader and stronger than in the other articulations. As the eleventh and twelfth ribs have no tu- berosities, and the transverse processes of the corresponding vertebrfe are but little developed, it follows that there is no costo-transverse articulation ; but yet there is a costo-transverse interosseous ligament. AJl these ligaments are much more loose than in the other articulations. The Chondro-sternal Articulations ( fig. 69.). These are seven in number on each side, formed by the internal angular end of the cartilages, which are received into the angular cavities on the side of the sternum The means of union are, 1. a radiated or anterior chondro-sternal liga- ment (a,'fig. 69.), which is tolerably strong: it/^-o^^f ^'"'.^,7;*^ The corresponding Ugament of the opposite side and is blended both w. h the periosteum and the tponeurotic insertions of the greater pectoral muscles, m ?he thick fibrous layer which covers the sternum ; 2. two small ^ superior and an inferior; 3. a radiated or posterior chondro-sternal hgamcit much weaker than the anterior. The ^--^'r^ " ?7 a^dTJ n^n merely inferred from analogy, for it cannot be demonstrated. (\ide Abtich- ■LATIONS IN GENERAL.MECHANISM OF THE THORAX. 175 The first, second, sixth, and seventh, chondro-sternal articulations present some peculiarities. 1. The cartUage of the first nb is sometimes continuous with the sternum, and is sometimes articulated like the cartilages of the other ribs. I found in one subject the first rib excessively moveable, because its cartilage, instead of being continuous with the sternum, had its upper edge ap- pUed to the side of that bone to which it was united by ligaments, and was ul- timately articulated by a narrow extremity immediately above the second rib. 2. The second cartilage (6) is much more angular at its inner extremity than any of the others : it is received into the retreating angle formed by the union of the first two pieces of the sternum. Sometimes there is an interosseous li- gament in this joint, running from the angle of the cartilage to the bottom of the cavity, and there are then two synovial capsules i in other cases there is only one (c), but it is always more marked than in the other joints. 3. Ihe articulations of the sixth and seventh cartilages, besides the anterior ligaments have also a chondro-xiphoid ligament, more or less strong, which crosses with the ligament of the opposite side in front of the ensiform cartilage and the lower end of the sternum. Sometimes this ligament only exists for the seventh cartilage; It is intended not only to strengthen the chondro-sternal articula- tions, but also to maintain the xiphoid appendix in its place. TJie Chondro-costal Articulations. The cartilages are immoveablj united to the ribs; the anterior extremity of the rib is hollowed to receive the external end of the cartilage j there is no ligament. The periosteum is the only bond of union, as in the articulations of the cranial bones. The Articulations of the Costal Cartilages. The first, second, third, fourth and fifth, costal cartilages do not articulate together, unless the aponeurotic laminae, sometimes very strong, which form the continuation of the external intercostal muscles, and occupy the whole length of the cartilages, be considered as uniting media. The sixth seventh, and eighth cartilages, frequently the fifth, and sometimes the ninth, present true articulations. Some cartilaginous processes arise from the neighbouring edges, and come in contact with each other: there are sometimes two articular facettes between the sixth and the seventh cartilages. The means of union are some vertical fibres united in bundles so as to form two ligaments, the one anterior and thicker, the other posterior and thinner. There is a much more distinct synovial membrane than in the chondro-sternal articulations. The seventh, eighth, and tenth cartilages have not always articular facettes, hut are simply united by vertical ligaments. Mechanism of the Thorax. As the thorax performs the double office of protecting the organs which it incloses, and of assisting by its movements in the function of respiration, we must consider its mechanism with reference to both these ends. Mechanism of the Thorax, for the Protection of the contained Organs. 1. The following is the mechanism by which the thorax is enabled to resist pressure or violent blows directed from before backwards. The sternum is supported by the fourteen ribs, which like buttresses oppose their united strength to any causes of displacement or fracture; it is therefore very rare to find the sternum driven backwards, and all the ribs broken, however great the violence may have been. The elasticity of the cartilages and of the ribs, and the number of articulations which exist in the thorax, are all circumstances most favourable to strength, because they diminish the intensity of external blows by neutralising a certain amount of impulse : yet I have met with one case, in which all the sternal ribs were broken by a fall, as completely as if the176 ARTHROLOGr. anterior wall of the thorax had been divided for an anatomical preparation I should remark, also, that the flexibility of the ribs and their cartilages permits great depression of the sternum without fracture ; and this explains the pos- sibility of contusion, and even rupture, of the heart, lungs, or great vessels ■without fracture of the bones of the thorax. The degree of resistance of the anterior wall of the thorax may be also considerably varied, by the state of relaxation or contraction of the muscles, which should be considered as active and contractile supports to the arch, of which the sternum forms the key stone. •2. In the case of lateral pressure or blows, the thorax resists, like an arch, the vault of which is represented by the convexity of the twelve ribs, and its pillars by the sternum in front and the vertebraB behind. External violence cannot act upon the whole side of the chest at once, as it does upon the front, and therefore the ribs offer a more partial resistance laterally, and are accor- dingly much more easily broken by direct blows. In this case, also, as in the former, when the elevator muscles of the ribs are in action, the resistance is considerably increased; and individuals have been then able to bear enor- mous weights, which would, in all probability, have fractured the ribs, had the muscles been relaxed. What has been said above of the manner in which the ribs withstand violence, is not however applicable to the false ribs, which having no fixed Doint on the sternum, are depressed into the abdominal cavity. Mechanism of the Thorax, with reference to Mobility. The thorax is not equally moveable throughout. The middle which cor- responds to the heart, and is formed by the sternum and vertebral column, has a very limited degree of mobility, while the sides which correspond to the lungs are endowed with the power of extensive motion. The movements of the thorax consist of alternate dilatations and contractions, from which its mechanism has been compared to that of a pair of bellows. They result from the motions which take place at the costo-vertebral and chondro-sternal articulations, and at the articulations of the cartilages with each other. We cannot explain the movements of each rib and of the entire thorax, without first analysing the motions at each of the above joints. Movements of the Costo-vertebral Articulations. These articulations permit only very limited gliding motions. In these movements, each rib represents a lever which moves upon the fulcrum afforded by the vertebral column. It may describe the movements, 1. of elevation ; 2. of depression ; 3. it may be carried inwards ; 4. it may be carried outwards ; 5. it may perform a revolving motion, around the cord of the arc which it re- presents. These different movements, which are very obscure in the imme- diate neighbourhood of the joint, are more evident the greater the distance is from the posterior end of the rib. The means of union between the ribs and vertebree are so strong, that luxation of the ribs is impossible, and the causes which would tend to produce it would break the neck of the rib. Each rib is capable of performing all these motions; but as they vary in de- gree in the different ribs, we must examine them comparatively in the series of costo-vertebral articulations. The eleventh and the twelfth ribs possess the most extensive power of motion. They owe ttis, 1. to the circumstance of their being scarcely at all united to the very small transverse processes ; *> to the loose state of their ligaments; and 3. to the almost perfect flatness of their articular surfaces. The extent of their movements inwards and out- wards should be also noticed. We shaU find these movements, but less pro- nounced, in the eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs, but they scarcely exist in the first *^The"hape of the head of the first rib is undoubtedly favourable to mobility,ARTICULATIONS OF THE RIBS. 177 and has suggested the idea that it is the most moveable of aU the nbs; but the articulation of its tubercle with the transverse process of the first dorsal ver- tebra, and the tightness of its ligaments, sufficiently explain why this opinion ThrmOTements which take place in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh costo-vertebral articulations, do not differ sufficiently to require any special mention. Movements of the Chondro-stemal Articulations. In these articulations, there is even less gliding than in the preceding. The anterior extremity of the first rib, or rather of the cartilage which forms its continuation, is the least moveable of aU; more commonly, it is completely fixed on account of its continuity with the sternum, —a circumstance which neutralises the favourable conditions for mobility presented by its posterior extremity. The eleventh and twelfth ribs, whose anterior extremities are con- nected only to soft parts, are the most moveable. The mobility of the ribs in front decreases from the lower to the upper part of the thorax; to this rule the second rib is an exception, chiefly on account of the two synovial membranes at its chondro-stemal articulation, which permit of greater motion. Movements of Hie Cartilages upon each other. The movements of this kind are restricted to the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs, the cartilages of which alone are articulated to each other; they are simple gliding motions ; and the ribs thus connected are always moved simultaneously. Movements of the entire Rib. The movements of the entire rib are composed, 1. of those which take place at the sternal and vertebral articulations ; and 2. of those which result from its own flexibility and elasticity. We shall endeavour to reduce the subject to its most simple elements. Let us suppose, then, that the ribs are straight, in- flexible levers: from their oblique position in reference to the vertical axis of the spinal column, their elevation will increase the width of the intercostal spaces; for it is a law of physics, that lines which are oblique with regard to another line, and parallel to each other, become further separated when they are placed perpendicularly to that line. A second eflfect of the elevation of this oblique lever is the advancement of the anterior extremity of the rib, and con- sequent increase of the antero-posterior diameter of the thorax. But as the ribs are curved levers, in assuming the horizontal position, their concavity must come to be directed perpendicularly to the median plane formed by the me- diastinum. It may be shown geometrically, that the concavity of an arc which falls perpendicularly upon a plane, includes a greater space than when it falls obliquely. * The arcs of the ribs, however, have not all the same curvature : each rib has its own peculiar perimeter, and it maybe proved that the more curved the rib, the greater is the projection outwards which it forms when elevated. Lastly, as in some ribs the ujjper border forms the segment of a smaller circle than the lower, the movement of projection outwards is proportionally greater in these than in the other ribs. This assertion may be experimentally proved by imitating the movements of elevation and depression on the second rib. f IS the ribs and their cartilages were inflexible levers, the movements of ele- vation would be much restrained; but their flexibility admits of more extensive * Borelli, t. ii. p. 177. ,l■,r^nI''^,V1®^^"'■^""'"'' Haller. it appears that the second rib is the most elevated rn?fs'SXUh\^t!,Ul;^7?L''^trf" " that its exce^'ri^'?;;r- VOL.

The result of this flexibility is a twisting motion, -which occurs principally in the cartilage, and during which the rib acts like a lever. This movement of torsion or of rotation in a rib round an axis, represented by the cord of the arc which it forms, is in a direct ratio to the length of the rib and its cartilage. We shall now examine the movements of the thorax in general. Movements of the Thorax in general. The general movements of the thorax -which result from those partial motions we have been engaged in considering are, 1. A movement of dilatation, cor- responding with the act of inspiration; 2. A movement of contraction, corre- sponding with that of expiration. 1. The dilatation of the thorax is caused by the elevation of the ribs. By this movement, the anterior extremity of each rib is carried forwards, and the antero-posterior diameter of the thorax is thus increased; the most excentric portion of the rib is carried outwards, and the transverse diameter of the thorax is thereby augmented. There is a sort of antagonism between the upper and lower part of the thorax, with regard to the direction in which the increase in its capacity is effected: in the upper part the transverse diameter is most augmented; in the lower, the antero-posterior diameter. So long as the elevation of the ribs is effected through means of the costo- vertebral articulations, and the flexibility of the ribs and their cartilages, the sternum scarcely participates in the motion; but when the elevation is carried beyond a certain point, the sternum is carried upwards with the ribs; and the first rib which may be looked upon as the prop of the sternum, also partici- pates in the motion. The sternum does not perform an angular motion during its elevation, as Haller imagined ; the whole of it is carried forwards at once, retaining its pri- mitive direction, as Borelli had previously well pointed out. We have as yet only spoken of the increase in the capacity of the thorax in the antero-posterior and transverse directions; its enlargement vertically is produced by a totally different mechanism, viz. the contraction of the dia- phragm combined with the elevation of the ribs: we shall notice this afterwards. 2. The contraction of the thorax is effected by the depression of the ribs. This is produced, 1. by their own weight; 2. by the elasticity of their carti- lages, which being no longer maintained in a twisted condition, in consequence of the relaxation of the muscles engaged in elevating the ribs, react, and restore the ribs to their original position, so that, as Haller has ingeniously re- marked, the rib and the cartilage are alternately the cause of their respective movements ; 3. by the action of the muscles of expiration.

Articulations of the shoulder. — Scapulo-humeral. — Humero-cubital. — liadio- cubital.—Radio-carpal. — Of the carpus and metacarpus. — Of the fingers. Akticcxations of the Shouldeb. The two bon es of the shoulder are articulated together; the cla-vicle is also united with the sternum and the first rib. There are therefore two orders of articula- tions, 1. the intrinsic articulations of the shoulder, viz. the acromio- and coraco- clavicular articulations; 2. the extrinsic, or the sterno- and costo-clavicular. The Acromio- and Coraco-clavicular Articulations. The clavicle is articulated, 1. with the acromion by its external extremity, the acrmnio-clavicular articulation; 2. with the coracoid process by its lower surface, the coraco-clavicular articulation. Preparation. Remove the skin, the cellular tissue, and the muscles which surround the joints; separate the acromion from the spine of the scapula; re- move in succession the difierent layers of the superior acromio-clavicular li- gament, so as to be able to judge of its thickness.

It is composed of several layers, the deepest being the shortest. 3. A stjnovial membrane, of a very simple construction, supported below by adipose tissue. Coraco-clavicular Articulation (fig. 69.). There can be no doubt concerning the existence of an articulation, where two surfaces are contiguous and capable of a gliding motion on each other; a J one of them, the coracoid, being almost always covered with cartilage and a sjmovial mem- brane ; and the other, the cla- vicular, presenting sometimes a considerable process. The means of union are two ligaments, or rather two dis- tinct ligamentous bundles, a posterior and an anterior: ' they are called coraco-cla- vicular. 1. The posterior ligament, named also the conoid or radiated (e,fig. 69.), is triangular, and directed vertically ; it commences by a narrow extremity, at the base of the coracoid process, and is inserted into a series of tubercles on the posterior edge of the clavicle near its outer extremity. 2. The anterior ligament (/) {trapezoid ligament of Boyer), arises from the internal edge of the coracoid process, and from the whole extent of the rough projection on the base of this process: from this it proceeds very obliquely to the ridge on the lower surface, near the external end of the clavicle. The two coraco-clavicular ligaments are continuous, and can only be dis- tinguished by the direction of their fibres. We might with propriety range among the means of union of this joint an aponeurotic lamina, to which much importance has been attached in surgical anatomy, and which is known by the name of the costo-clavicular aponeurosis or costo-coracoid ligament. It may be easily felt under the pectoralis major in emaciated individuals: it extends from the inner edge of the coracoid process, to the lower surface of the clavicle, and converts the groove for the subclavius muscle into a canal. * In individuals wlio Iiave exercised tlie upper extremities very mucli, these surfaces arn uneven, and unequally incrusted with newly-formed cartilage.ARTHROLOGY. ISO Mechanism of the Acromio- and Coraco-davicular Articulations. The acromio- and coraco-clavicular articulations perform well-marked fflidintj movements: and in addition the scapula rotates forwards and backwards upon the clavicle to a considerable extent. In order to have a correct idea of these motions and their mechanism, it is necessary to procure a shoulder with the bgaments still attached, and to rotate the scapula backwards and forwards. It will be then seen that the scapula turns round an imaginary axis passing through its middle. The looseness of the posterior half of the orbicular and of the coraco-clavicular ligaments permits this rotatory motion; of the two coraco- clavicular ligaments, one limits the rotation forwards ; while the other, which, as we have observed, runs in an opposite direction, limits the rotation backwards. Although these motions are pretty extensive, they never give rise to disloca- tion, which can only be produced by falls on the top of the shoulder, the coraco-clavicular ligaments being lacerated if the luxation be complete. In- complete luxations may however take place without laceration of these liga- ments. The Sterna-clavicular Articulation {fig. 69.). The articulation of the inner end of the clavicle is composed of the sterno- clavicular and the costo-clavicular articulations. Preparation. Saw through the clavicles vertically at their middle, and also the first ribs at corresponding points ; and meet these two sections by a hori- zontal division of the sternum. In order to see the interior of the sterno-cla- vicular joint, open the fibrous capsule along the edge of the sternum above, or rather make a horizontal cut, which will divide it into two parts,' an upper and an under. In order to examine the costo-clavicular articulation, open the synovial mem- brane behind. The sterno-clavicular articulation belongs to those which are formed by mutual reception. Articular surfaces. The articular surface of the sternum is transversely oblong, concave in the same direction, and convex from befor^ backwards ; it looks obliquely upwards and outwards, and is situated on the side of the notch on the upper part of the sternum. 1. The articular surface of the clavicle is oblong from before backwards, slightly concave in the same direction, and convex transversely. From the respective configuration of these surfaces a mutual jointing results, and the short diameter of the one corresponds to the long diameter of the other; so that the end of the clavicle overlaps the surface of the sternum in front and behind, and the surface of the sternum projects beyond that of the clavicle on the inside and the outside.* 2. There is an inter-articular lamina of cartilage (i,fig. 69.) between the articular surfaces, which is moulded upon them, and is very thick, especially at the edges. It is sometimes perforated in the centre, f It is so closely united by its circumference to the orbicular ligament, that it is impossible to separate them: it adheres below to the cartilage of the first rib, and above and behind to the clavicle. Means of union. These are, I. The orbicular ligament (I, fig. 69.). This name may be given to the fibrous capsule which surrounds the joint in all di- rections. The fibres which compose it have been regarded as forming two distinct bundles, known by the name of anterior and posterior ligaments ; but it is impossible to distinguish between them. Fibres proceed from all parts * Bichat considers that this arrangement of the articular surfaces predisposes to luxation ; it appears to me to have a precisely opposite efifect, as it permits the surfaces to move upon each other to a considerable extent without being separated. , , , . , t In a greiit number of cases this ligament ir found partially wasted by the continued pres- sure to which the joint is subjected.ARTICULATIONS OF THE SHOULDER. 181 N 3 of the circumference of the articular surface of the clavicle, obliquely do-wn, wards and inwards to the circumference of the articular surface of the sternum. The capsule is not of equal thickness throughout; it is thinner and somewhat looser in front than behind, which may partly account for the more frequent luxations of the clavicle forwards than backwards. 2. The inter-clavicular ligament {m, fig. 69.), consisting of a very distinct bundle stretching horizontally above the fourchette of the sternum, from the upper part of the inner end of one clavicle to the inner end of the other. This ligament, which is much nearer the posterior than the anterior part of the joint, establishes a sort of continuity between the clavicles. It is the only direct means of union between the two shoulders. 3. There are two synovial capsules in this joint. That which is between the sternimi and the inter-articular cartilage is more loose than that between the cartilage and the clavicle. The Costo-clavicular Articulation (fig. 69.). The articulation between the clavicle and the cartilage of the first rib is an arthrodia. It is formed between an articular surface, which almost always exists on the lower surface of the clavicle, and a corresponding facette on the upper surface of the inner end of the first rib, at its junction with the cartilage. There is, in this articulation, a synovial membrane, which is loose, especially behind. There is only one ligament, —the costo-clavicular (g,fig. 96.), a thick strong bimdle of fibres, quite distinct from the tendon of the subclavius muscle, which is placed in front of it. It is fijced to the inner part of the first costal car- tilage, and is di^^cted very obliquely upwards and outwards, to be inserted into the under surface of the clavicle, to the inner side of the articular facette. Mechanism of the Sterno- clavicular Articulation. This articulation is the moveable centre of the motions of the shoulder, and of the whole upper extremity ; and hence the utility of an inter-articular car- tilage, to obvi^e the efi'ects of blows or pressure: hence also the wearing away of this cartilage, the deformity and wasting of the articular surfaces, the depression of the right sternal facette, and lastly the difference in the size of the sternal extremities of the right and left clavicles. This articulation, like all those effected by mutual reception, admits of mo- tions in every direction, —viz. upwards, downwards, forwards, backwards, — and of circumduction, resulting from the preceding, but not of rotation. 1. Movement of elevation. In this the sternal facette of the clavicle glides downwards upon the corresponding surface of the sternum; the inter-clavicular ligament is relaxed; the cartilage of the first rib comes in contact with the mner extremity of the clavicle, limits the degree of elevation, and prevents dis- placement. 2. Movement of depression. In this the sternal end of the clavicle glides in the opposite direction; the articular surfaces of the costo-clavicular articulation P^^^s jt^o°gly against each other, and limit the extent of this movement. It should be remarked, that in this movement the subclavian artery is compressed between the clavicle and the first rib, sometimes so completely as to arrest the circulation in the limb. 3 In the movement of the shoulder backwards, the inner end of the clavicle gimes forwards upon the surface of the sternum ; the anterior part of the or- Dicuiar capsule is stretched; and if the movement is carried beyond a certain point the capsule is torn, and the clavicle dislocated forwards. ^^tLJl ^^^Mward movement of the shoulder, the inner end of the clavicle gucies backwards. The anterior part of the orbicular ligament is relaxed, and the Lpn ! as also the inter-clavicular ligament, which, as we have ^een, is nearer the back than the front of the joint. In this motion luxaUon182 ARTHROLOGY. may take place backwards. It may be remarked that, of all the movements of the shoulder the one described, in which the clavicle is liable to be dislo- cated backwards, is the most uncommon. The movement of circumduction is more extensive forwards and upwards than backwards. The motions at the sterno-clavicular articulation are very circum- scribed in themselves ; but when transmitted by the lever of the clavicle, they become very considerable at the apex of the shoulder. Mechanism, of the Costo-clavicular Articulation. This articulation, which may be regarded as a dependence of the sterno- clavicular, admits of very limited motions, subordinate to those of the joint last described.

These are the glenoid cavity of the scapula, slightly con- cave of an oval form with the large end downwards, and looking directly out- wards, and the head of the humerus, consisting of about a third of a sphere, and presenting a surface three or four times more extensive than the glenoid cavity. The axis of the head of the humerus forms a very obtuse angle with that of the shaft of the bone. „ ., i. ^i. x,„„a These two surfaces are covered by a layer of caitUage, which, on the head of the humerus, is thicker at the centre than at the circumference; while the reverse obtains in the glenoid cavity. . , , • v Glenoid ligament (a, fig. 70.).

Notwithstanding this addition, the head of the humerus is still too larffe to be received into the cavity, so that a portion of it is always in contact with the capsular ligament, an inconvenience that is ^ obviated, in some measure, by the existence of a supplementary cavity, as'^e shall Presently see.

This name may, with propriety, be applied to the tendon (t, fig. 70.) of the long head of the biceps, which, arismg from the upper part of the glenoid cavity, turns like a cord over the head of the humerus, and passes aloni the bicipital groove. It acts by keeping the head of the humerus appUed to the glenoid cavity, and forms a sort of arch that supports the hone when it is forced upwards. In two subjects, I found this tendon termmatmg by a strong adhesion in the bicipital groove, and thus justifying the name ot inter-articular Ugament, which I have applied to it: the tendon for the long head of the biceps took its origin from the same groove. I consider this division of the tendon to have been accidental, for the bicipital groove was depressed, and the inter-articular ligament flattened, and as it were lacerated. The synovial capsule is remarkable, inasmuch as, 1. It forms a fold round the tendon of the biceps, which is prolonged into the bicipital groove, and termi- nates below by a cul-de-sac or circular fold, which prevents the effusion of the synovia; 2. It is open in one or two points*, and presents two prolongations communicating with the synovial bursre of the subscapularis and infra-spinatus. Supplementary cavity. "We may regard as a dependence of the scapulo-humeral articulation the vaulted arch formed by the coracoid and acromion processes, and the ligament which unites them. In shape it corresponds to the head of the humerus, and is so constructed that the coracoid process prevents displace- ment inwards; the acromion prevents it upwards and outwards; and the liga- ment between them opposes dislocation directly upwards. This provision evi- dently compensates for the incomplete, reception of the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity.

Its external edge becomes thinner, and is continued into an aponeurotic lamina below the deltoid muscle, and separating that muscle from the joint. It is lined below by a synovial membrane, and is separated from the clavicle by fattv tissue.* ' ^ Mechanism of the Scapula-humeral Articulation. The scapulo-humeral articulation admits of the most extensive movements of any joint in the body ; it is capable of every kind of motion; vi?. forwards and backwards, and also those of adduction, abduction, circumduction, and rotation. Forward and backward motions. In these the head of the humerus rolls upon the glenoid cavity, and moves round the axis of the neck of the humerus, while the lower extremity of the bone describes the arc of a circle, of which the centre is atthe joint, the radius being represented by the humerus. The forward movement is very extensive, and may be carried so far that the humerus may take a vertical direction exactly opposite to the natural one. The motion back- wards is produced by the same mechanism ; the head of the humerus turns upon its axis. This movement is limited by the contact of the head of the humerus with the coracoid process, without which dislocation foi-wards would be very easily produced. It should be remarked that, in any considerable movement of the humerus forwards, the scapula is also moved, performing that sort of ro- tation which we spoke of when considering the mechanism of the shoulder. The movement outwards, or abduction, is the most remarkable. It belongs exclusively to animals possessed of a clavicle. In it the head of the humerus does not turn upon an axis; it glides downwards upon the glenoid cavity, and presses upon the lower part of the capsule. The shape of the glenoid cavity, which has its long diameter vertical, and its broad part below, is advantageous as regards this motion. When abduction is carried so far that the humerus forms a right angle with the axis of the trunk, a great part of the head of the bone is below the glenoid cavity. If, while in this condition, the arm be moved forwards or backwards, the great tuberosity of the humerus-rubs against the coraco-acromial ^rch, and forms with it a sort of supplementary articulation, lubricated by the bursa above described. The movement of abduction may be carried so far as lo allow the arm to touch the head without dislocation ; for the capsular ligament is sufficiently loose, especially below, to receive almost the whole head of the bone without being torn. It should be remarked, that during abduction, the scapula is fixed, which explains the frequency of luxa- tions of the humerus downwards.; Adduction is limited by the arm meeting with the thorax. When it is com- bined with the forward motion, the upper and back part of the capsule and the muscles which cover it are considerably stretched. The scapula does not participate in this movement, during which luxation can be occasioned only by a very strong impulse on the arm upwards and backwards. Circumduction is nothing more than the transition of the humerus from one to another of these motions. The cone which it describes is much more ex- * [This is tlie Ugamentum proprium anterius of authors ; but the author has taken no notice of another ligament proper to the scapula, viz. the Ugamentum proprium postcrius, a thin band of fibres stretched across the notch at the base of the coracoid process, which it tliui converts into a foramen. The supra-scapular nerve generally passes below, and the artery above it.]185 ARTICULATIONS OF THE ELBOW. tensive in front than behind,-a circumstance tending greatly to facilitate the prehension of external objects, which is the chief purpose of the upper ex^e- Lties. This predominance of the forward motions has been already noticed m the sterno-clavicular articulation, and wUl be found also in many others^ Rotation. In this movement the humerus does not turn upon its own but upon an imaginary axis, directed from the head of the humerus to the epi- trochlea,paraUeltothebone. The manner in whichfte rotatory muscles em W the head of the hnmerus is highly favourable to this motion, by compensating fortheshortnessof the neck, which serves as alever for the rotatory movements. The Humero-cubitax Articulation, or Elbow-joint {figs. 71 and 72.). Preparation. 1. Remove carefully the brachialis anticus muscle ; 2. Detach the tendon of the triceps from above downwards without opening the synovia capsule ; 3.

On the humerus we find, 1. an ahnost perfect trochlea or pulley, presenting two edges, of which the internal is the more prominent, so that when the end of the bone rests upon a horizontal plane, its shaft is di- rected very obliquely from above downwards and inwards ; 2. the small head, or articular condyle separated from the trochlea by a furrow which is also articular ; 3. two cavities, a posterior which is very deep, and is intended to receive the olecranon process, and an anterior which is shallower, and re- ceives the coronoid.

The greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna, which exactly embraces the trochlea ; 2. the glenoid cavity of the radius, which receives the small head of ttie humerus. The means of union consist of four liga- ments, — two lateral, an anterior, and a posterior. 1. The external lateral ligament (a, fig. 71, 72.) is blended with the tendon of the supinator brevis; it is of a triangular form, and stretches fi-om the external tube- rosity of the humerus to the annular liga- ment with which it becomes continuous, and which seems to be in part formed by it. Some fibres of this ligament are also inserted into the outer part of the sigmoid cavity of the ulna. This connection of the lateral with the annular ligament is of great importance, with reference to the production of luxations of the upper end of the radius. * 2. The internallateral ligament {b,fig. 71.) is composed of three bundles, which com- mence at the internal tuberosity of the humerus and radiate, the anterior from behind forwards to the inner side of the coronoid process, the middle vertically downwards to the inner edge of the same process, and the posterior backwards to the inner edge of the o£cranon. 3. The anterior ligament (c) is a very thin layer, in which however three orders of fibres can be recognised. The first directed vertically form a bundle * The luxations of the radius upon the ulna in dislocations of the elbow result from this connection of the external lateral with the annular ligament.ARTHROLOGY. 186 which extends from the upper part of the coronoid cavity to the lo^wer part of the coronoid process; the second are transverse, and intersect the first at right angles ; and lastly, the third are obliquely directed downwards and outwards to the annular ligament. * 4. The posterior ligament {d,fig. 72.). The place of the posterior ligament is occupied by the olecranon and the tendon of the triceps. There are some fibres, however, which extend from the external to the internal tuberosity of the humerus, which are in relation with the synovial membrane in front, and the tendon of the triceps behind. The synovial membrane covers the posterior surface of the anterior ligament: from this it is reflected upon the coronoid cavity, covers the olecranon cavity behind, and is prolonged a little between the tendon of the triceps and the back of the humerus. In this place it is widest and most loose. Below, it forms a prolongation which extends into the radio-cubital articulation, covering the whole inner surface of the annular ligament, and forming a circular cul-de-sac below it.f There is some synovial adipose tissue round the points of reflection, and also at the margin of the olecranon cavity. Mechanism of the Humero-cubital Articulation. Extension and flexion, the only motions performed by this joint, are executed by it with remarkable precision and rapidity. The precision of these move- ments depends, 1. upon the exact fitting of the articular surfaces, no articulation so well deserving the name of a hinge-joint; 2. upon the great extent of the transverse diameter, round which the movements of flexion and extension are performed as round an axis; 3. their rapidity depends chiefly on the smallness of the circle to which the curve of the humeral trochlea belongs. 1. Flexion. In this motion, which is very extensive, the raidus and ulna move as a single bone from behind forwards, on the smaU head and trochlea of the humerus. It should be observed that, in this movement, the obliquity of the trochlea from behind forwards, and from without inwards, throws the fore-arm, when bent, in front of the thorax, aud the hand in front of the mouth. This motion is limited by the meeting of the coronoid process with the coro- noid cavity. When this motion is carried to the greatest extent, the upper end of the olecranon descends to the level of the lowest part of the trochlea, and is, consequently, below the line which passes through the two tuberosities, or condyles of the humerus. In this motion, the back part of the trochlea and the olecranal fossa are covered only by the tendon of the triceps, so that in- struments can readily enter the joint at this place. 2 Extension. In this movement the radius and ulna roU backwards upon the humerus. This motion can only be carried so far that the fore-ann and the arm form a right line, for then the upper part of the olecranon comes m con- tact with the bottom of the olecranal fossa. The anterior hgament and the anterior and middle bundles of the internal lateral ligament are put on the stretch and thus concur in limiting the movement of extension. There is no appreciable lateral motion of this joint, the exact fitting of the articular sur- faces effectually preventing it. The Radio-citbital Articulations {figs. 71 to 75.).

The breadth of the annular hg^ent is from three to W lines, ^nd its upper circumference is wider than the lower, which con- struction iends to maintain the head of the radius in its situation more accu- rately With regard to its structure I would observe, that it is much thicker behind where it receives the insertion of the external lateral Ugament, than in front where it may be much more easily ruptured; and I am persuaded that in luxation of the elbow it is not the external lateral ligament yfhich. is most commonly torn, but rather the anterior portion of the annular. _ The synovial capsule is a sort of diverticulum fi-om that of the elbow-jomt, which is prolonged upon the inner surface of the annular Ugament, and is re- flected upwards from its lower margin, so as to form a sort of cul-de-sac below it. Inferior Radio-cubital Articulation. Preparation. 1. Remove the muscles on both aspects of the fore-arm; 2. Se- parate the hand from the fore-arm so as to expose the lower surface of the triangular ligament, or fibro-cartilage; 3. In order to examme the interior of the joint, saw through the middle of the fore-arm; divide the anterior and pos- terior Ugaments; separate the two bones of the fore-arm; cut through the triangular ligament at its insertion into the ulna. The articular surfaces are a smaU sigmoid cavity on the radius, analogous to that which we have described at the upper end of the ulna, and the ex- ternal two thirds of the circumference of the head of the ulna. This articu- lation, therefore, is precisely the reverse of the upper, since in this the ulna furnishes the head, and the radius the sigmoid cavity, whilst a precisely op- posite arrangement obtains in the upper joint. The means of union are, 1. some fibres stretched in front and behind the joint, and called anterior (if, figs. 71. and 75.) and posterior (g,figs. 72. and 74.) ligaments. They form a very imperfect annular Ugament. They extend from the anterior and posterior margins of the sigmoid cavity of the radius, to the anterior and posterior surfaces of the styloid process of the ulna. 2. The triangular ligament, or rather cartilage {i,figs. 71. and 73.). This is a triangular lamina of cartilage, the apex of which is fixed into the angle formed by the head and styloid process of the ulna, and its base into the lower edge of the sigmoid cavity of the radius. It is thin at the base and the centre, and thick at the apex and the circumference. It concurs in maintaining theARTHROLOGY. union of the radius and ulna, and performs the office of those inter-articular cartilages, which we have noticed as peculiar to such joints as are most ex- posed to shocks and friction; and ahove all, it restores the level of the inferior radio-cuhital surface by filling up the vacancy caused by the projection of the raaius below the ulna. There is a separate synovial membrane for this joint (see above i, fig. 75) (often called membrana sacciformis). It covers the upper surface o£ the tri- angular ligament, and the sort of incomplete ring which circumscribes the head of the ulna. It forms very loose folds at the places of reflection, which admit of very extensive rotation. ' Middle Radio-cubital Articulation, or Interosseous Ligament. The interosseous ligament (J, figs. 71, 72.), improperly so called, is an apo- neurosis which occupies the interval between the radius and ulna, and whieli appears to serve principally for the insertion of 'muscles. It is broader in the middle than at the ends, and does not reach the extremities of the interosseous space, for there is an interval above and below, which serves the purpose of giving passage to nerves and vessels, and also permits more free motion be- tween the two bones. The fibres which compose it are directed obliquely downwards and inwards, i. e. from the radius to the ulna. We generally ob- serve on its anterior aspect several bundles running downwards and outwards ; the superior and the strongest of these is caUed the round ligament, or the liga- mentous cord of Weitbrecht (m, fig. 71.). It extends obliquely downwards and outwards, from the outside of the coronoid process of the ulna to the lower part of the bicipital tuberosity of the radius. Its direction is, therefore, precisely the inverse of that of the fibres of the interosseous ligament. Mechanism of the Radio-cubital Articulations. These articulations, like all trochlear joints, only admit of one kind of motion, viz. rotation, which is here called by a peculiar name. Rotation forwards is denominated pronation; rotation backwards is called supination. We must examine these in both the upper and the lower radio-cubital articulations. Mechanism of the superior Radio-cubital Articulations. Pronation. In this movement, the inner part of the head of the radius rolls backwards upon the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and may be carried so far that the radius may describe half a circle upon its axis. Notwithstanding the obstacles to displacement resulting from the strength of the back part of the annular ligaments, and the presence of the two little hooks, one in front and the other behind the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and lastly, notwith- standing the advantage produced by the reception of the small head of the humerus in the cup-like cavity of the upper end of the radius, in violent pro- nation the head of the radius is frequently luxated backwards. Perhaps no dislocation is more common in infancy than the incomplete luxation backwards of the upper end of the radius, on account of the greater looseness of the annu- lar ligament and the less complete reception of the small head of the humerus in the cupula of the radius. The cause occasioning this displacement is forced pronation, so frequent when infants are held by the hand, in attempting to save them from falling. . In supination the head of the radius turns upon its axis m a different di- rection, i. e. its inner part glides forwards upon the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna. K it be carried too far, dislocation forwards may be the consequence.* » This displacement is very uncommon, on account of the hook-like projection at the an- terior extremity of the sigmoid cavity, and doubtless, also, because forcible supination is very rare. Professor Dugfis informs me that he has seen an instance of this dislocation of the radius, and proved its existence by inspection after death.189 RADIO-CUBITAL ARTICULATIONS. Mechanism of the inferior Radio-cubital Articulations. The movements of pronation and supination, at the lower radio-cubital arti- culation, are produced by a mechanism which is precisely the inverse of the former, for the radius, instead of rotating upon its own axis, turns round the head of the ulna by a movement of circumduction. This difference results partly fi-om the curvature of the radius, and partly from the great transverse diameter of its lower end, which forms the radius of the arc of the circle which it describes round the ulna. In pronation the Uttle sigmoid cavity rolls for- wards on the articular edge of -the head of the ulna; in supination it glides in the opposite liirection, that is, backwards. We see then that, in the lower articulation, a concave surface moves upon a convex, while the contrary takes place at the upper. The triangular Jigament has no effect in limiting these motions; but they are restrained by means of the anterior and posterior ligaments. In forcible pronation these may be broken, and the head of the ulna dislocated backwards ; in forcible supination it may be dislocated forwards. It should be remarked that, in cases of luxation of the ulna, the head of this bone does not lacerate the capside, but the capsule is torn upon it; for, as we shall afterwards see, the ulna is immoveable at the cubito-carpal joint, and takes no share in the partial motions of the fore-arm. Mechanism of the Radio-cubital Articulations, considered with reference to the Bodies of the two Bones. In the movement of pronation, the radius crosses the ulna at an acute angle, so that its lower part is carried in front of the ulna, while the upper remains on the outside. The movement of supination consists in the return of the radius to its state of parallelism with the ulna. In pronation, the interosseous ligament is relaxed; in supination, it is stretched: its absence at the upper part of the fore-arm, where its place is supplied by the ligament of Weitbrecht, allows more extensive rotatory movements. * The existence of the interosseous space is an indispensable condition for the performance of pronation and supination; and therefore every curative plan for the treatment of fractures of the fore-arm which does not provide for the preservation of this space should at once be rejected. In the explanation we have given of the mechanism of the radio-cubital articulations, the ulna has been considered as an immoveable axis round which the radius executes below certain movements of circumduction; but many au- thors liave maintained the opinion that the ulna also takes part in these mo- tions. Without discussing the different theories which have been successively proposed on this subject, we shall mention an experiment which is at once de- cisive of the question. If all the articulations of the arm be exposed from the shoulder to the hand, and the humerus be immoveably fixed in a vice, it will be seen that, when the fore-arm is pronated or supinated, the radius moves upon the ulna, which remains altogether undisturbed; and, also, that any lateral motion of the ulna is absolutely impossible from its perfect jointing with the humerus at the elbow. When the humerus is not completely fixed, it also rotates in conjunction with the bones of the fore-arm. Lastly, it should be observed that, when the radius is rotated during semi- flexion of the fore-arm, the motion is accompanied by slight degrees of flexion and extension at the elbow-joint. ligament, the fibres of which pass downw.irds from the radius to the no prolonged to the upper part of the interosseous space, it would have much im- S.hirh " supination, by limiting the movements of the bicipital tubcrosltj'.

Radio-carpal Articulation ifigs. 73. to 75:)j Preparation. Carefully remove the fibrous sheaths of the flexor and extensor tendons. This articulation belongs to the class of condylarthroses The articular surfaces (Jig. 73.) are those of the scaphoid, the semilunar, and the cuneiform, -which together form a condyle, oblong transversely, and covered by articular cartilages, which are prolonged further on the posterior than on the anterior aspect of the bones, and the transversely oblong concave, articular surface, formed by the lower ends of the radius and ulna. The radius which forms by itself two thirds of the surface corresponds to the scaphoid and semilunar, and presents an antero-posterior ridge, and a sUght contraction from before backwards, opposite the interval between these two bones. The ulna corresponds to the cuneiform bone, with the intervention of an inter-articular cartilage, viz. the triangular cartilage already described, which performs the part both of a ligament and an inter-articular cartilage. The concave surface presented by the lower part of the fore-arm is completed at the sides by the styloid processes of the radius and ulna. Means of union. There are two lateral, three anterior, and some posterior ligaments. The external lateral ligament (a,figs. 73, 74, 75.), stretches from the summit of the styloid process of the radius to the outer part of the scaphoid, where it is inserted by a broad attachment immediately on the outside of the radial ar- ticular surface of that bone. The anterior bundles of this ligament are the strongest. The internal lateral ligament (b, figs. 73, 74, 75.), is very sbght; it commences at the summit of the styloid process of the ulna, and divides into two fasciculi, one of which is attached to the pisiform, the other to the cuneiform bone. The anterior ligaments (^c,fig. 75.) are three in number, and all extend from the radius to the bones of the carpus. The external anterior ligament arises from the' styloid process of the radius, and is lost among the anterior ligaments of the carpus. The iniddle anterior ligament, straight and short, arises from the anterior edge of the lower end of the radius near the styloid process, and passes somewhat obliquely inwards to the ^nteiior extremity of the os semilunare. The internal anterior ligament also commences at the anterior edge of the radius, but to the inside of the preceding, and extends to the anterior extremity of the OS semilunare. This ligament is very strong, and is continuous with the tri- angular cartUage. . , The posterior ligaments (d, fig. 74.) are much weaker than the preceding; they are stretched obHquely from the posterior border of the articular surface of the radius, to the posterior extremity of the cuneiform and semilunar bones. Ihe fasciculus for the cuneiform bone is very thick. .... With reo-ard to the anterior and posterior ligaments of the wrist-joint, we may remark, that they all come exclusively from the radius, and closely unite the lower end of this bone to the first range of the carpus, and consequently to tne ^"^The synovial membrane (,see fig. 73.) is loose behind, where |f o^lf P^;-- tiallv covered by the ligaments we have described ; throughout the whole ot he reSng circumference of the joint it is strengthened by scattered liga- mLtous fibres, which some anatomists have described as a capsular hgament. ^Snovial membrane sometimes commimicates with that of the lower radio- tro^ttnl Se .™Lor lendo.s bekind, should be not.ced, a. ««r.mg 1. ,n«re>«e the strength of the joint.ARTICULATIONS OF THE CARPUS. Mechanism of the Radio-carpal Articulation. This articulation belongs to the condyloid class, and has, therefore, four mo- tioL viz Con! extension, abduction, and adduction, and by passing from elidef bXa rds upon the louver end of the fore-arm. The posterior hgaments £d the extin or tendons are put on the stretch. When the movement of flexion h ca^TiedSar^Etionmay take place by laceration of the posterior hgaments, Lnd then the ro;er end of the two bones of the fore-arm pass m front of the arttcSar surface of the bones of the first row of the carpus. It should however be observed, that the possibility of dislocation of this joint has been doubted 2 In eTtension, the condyle formed by the carpus rolls forwards upon the lo4r end of the fore-arm; and as the articular surface of the carpus reaches further on the back than in front, it follows that extension may be carried farther than flexion: it is limited by the strong anterior ligaments, and also by the lateral ligaments, which, as is generaUy observed, are attached nearer to the side of flexion, than to that of extension. _ n., a It should also be remarked, that extension is the easiest motion ot the hand upon the fore-arm: this may be readUy understood from the great power whicli the hand possesses when it forms a right angle beHnd with the fore-arm. _ 3. In abduction the condyle formed by the carpus rolls in the direction of its length, i. e. transversely and from without inwards, while the radial edge of the hand is inclined towards the radial edge of the fore-arm : this motion is limited by the mutual meeting of the styloid process of the radius, and the ex- ternal process of the scaphoid. 4. In adduction the ulnar edge of the hand is bent towards the ulnar edge of the fore-arm; the motion is limited by the meeting of the summit of the styloid process of the ulna and the cuneiform bone, and also by the tension of the external lateral ligament. It may be easily conceived, that in the lateral movements, which are per- formed in the direction of the long diameter of the articular surfaces, disloca- tion must be very diflScult, and that when it does occur it must be incomplete. The movement of circumduction is nothing more than a succession of the dif- ferent motions which have been already pointed out. The hand describes a cone, of greater extent behind, that is, in the direction of extension, than in front, or in the direction of flexion. It is also stiU more restricted in adduc- tion and abduction. Articulations of the Carpus (figs. 73 to 75.). These articulations comprise, 1. the articulations of the bones of each row together ; and 2. the articulations of the two rows. Articulations of the Bones of each Mow. Preparation. 1.

Articular surfaces. The articulations of the bones of each row are amphi- arthroses, and consequently present one part continuous, and another con- tiguous. The bones of the first row correspond to each other by oblique sur- faces, those of the second row by vertical and more extensive surfaces. Means of union. Two classes of ligaments belong to these joints: the one * We should observe that it is almost impossible to separate the mechanism of the carpal .■utioulations from that of the radio-carpal joint; the latter is noticed here by itselT only in order to conform with the anatomical divisions.192 ARTHROLOGY. IS extended between the corresponding surfaces, the interosseous ligaments; the other set are peripheral, and are divided into pahnar and dorsal. The palmar and dorsal ligaments are fibrous bundles stretched transversely or obliquely, from each of the bones of the carpus to those which are con- tiguous to it. The dorsal are much thinner than the palmar. The interosseous ligaments are not disposed in an exactly similar manner in the two rows, and we shall therefore examine them separately. 1. Those of the first row (e e,Jig. 73.) occupy only the upper part of the corresponding facettes ; they are nothing more than small fibrous bundles, one extending from the scaphoid (1) to the semilunar (2); the other from the semilunar to the cuneiform (3) ; they are sometimes partially interrupted, and present openings, which establish a communication between the general synovial membrane of the car- pus and that of the radio-carpal articulation. 2. The interosseous ligaments {d d d) of the second row are much thicker than those of the first; the whole non-articular portion of the corresponding facettes gives insertion to these ligaments, which are very compact, and of a much more dry and close texture than the reddish tissue connecting together the bones of the first row. It follows, therefore, that the bones of the second row are more firmly united than those of the first, whose interosseous ligaments are loose, and permit a certain degree of mobility. The articulation of the pisiform bone with the cuneiform merits a special description. Articulation of the Pisiform and Cuneiform Bones. For this articulation, the pisiform bone presents a single articular surface, which unites with the anterior facette of the cuneiform bone. There are four ligaments in this little joint: 1. too inferior (e, fig. 75.) -which are very strong ; viz. an external, stretched obliquely from the hook-like process of the unciform bone to the pisiform; and an internal, vertical, which is inserted into the upper end of the fifth metacarpal bone: 2. two lateral ligaments, broad and thin, which strengthen the synovial capsule in front and behind. The synovial capsule is most commonly a small isolated pouch; and some- times it is a prolongation of the radio-carpal synovial membrane. Articulation of the two Rows of the Carpus together. The articulation of the two rows of the carpus together presents an enar- throsis in the middle, and an arthrodia on each side. The articular surfaces consist of a head or spherical eminence received into a cavity, constituting the enarthrosis, and of plane surfaces on the mside and the outide which form the arthrodia. The head is formed by the os magnum (6 /i<7.73.) and the superior process of the os unciforme (7): the cavity is conSuted by the inferior surfaces of the scaphoid(l), the semihinar (2), and the cSorm(3) bones. This cavity, which is deeply notched .n front aaid behind, is completed in these situations by two ligaments-an a»tenor and a posterior, wHch might be caUed glenoid ligaments, considering their position on the edge of a cavity, and their use in increasing its depth Tht p Jslerior glenoid Ugammt is composed of transverse fibres, which are m- serted into the first row, closing up the posterior notch The anterior glenoid ligament, much stronger than the other, belongs to the second roS • Tt is confounded with the anterior ligaments of the articulation.ARTICULATIONS OF THE CARPUS. 193 between the two rows, and extends transversely from the os unciforme to the trapezium, passing in front of the neck and the head of the os magnum. Be- sides these ligaments we also find, 1. An anterior ligament (/, fig. 75.) which is very thick, and stretches from the anterior surface of the os magnimi by diverging rays to those three bones of the first row that form the enarthro- dial cavity, in which the head of the os magnum is received, viz. the sca- phoid, the semilimar, and the cuneiform. 2. A posterior ligament (?", fig. 74.), which consists merely of some fibres extending obliquely from the bones of the first row to those of the second. On the inside and the outside of this carpal enarthrosis we find an ar- throdia. On the inside is the articulation of the cuneiform (3, fig. 73.) with the unciform (7) bone, constituted by plane surfaces and strengthened by a very thin posterior ligament, an anterior ligament much thicker than the pre- ceding, and an internal lateral ligament (c). On the outside is the articulation of the scaphoid with the trapezium and the trapezoid. The articular surface of the scaphoid (1) is a sort of head or elongated convexity, and those of the trapezium (4) and the trapezoid (5) are two facettes, that unite in forming a concavity, into which the convexity of the scaphoid is received. This small articulation is strengthened by tivo anterior ligaments, both of which proceed from the scaphoid, and are connected one to the trapezium, and the other to the trapezoid, and two posterior arranged in a similar manner with the pre- ceding, but much thinner. A single synovial capsule (see fig. 73.), very loose, especially behind, covers the corresponding articular surfaces of the two rows. But it is also provided with small culs-de-sac, which penetrate into the intervals between the bones of each row, there being three below, and two above. Mechanism of the Carpus. The mechanism of the carpus must be considered as providing both for strength and mobility. The conditions favourable to strength are, 1. the number of bones in the carpus ; 2. the reciprocal dovetailing of the two rows; 3. the numerous ligaments connecting the bones of each row together. The carpus, therefore, has power to resist the most violent shocks, chiefly on ac- count of the expenditure of force at each of its numerous articulations. With regard to mobility, the movements between the bones of each row must be distinguished from those which take place between the two rows. 1. The partial movement between the component bones of each row is scarcely ap- preciable, and requires no consideration. 2. The mobility of the two rows upon each other is, however, more marked. The enarthrodial articulation of the head of the os magnum can only perform forward and backward motions, tor the arthrodial joints on each side prevent any lateral movements. Mecliamsm of the carpal enarthrosis. The movement of extension is very limited on account of the resistance of the anterior Ugaments. The move- ment of ^mon, on the contrary, is much more considerable: it may be carried sufficiently far to cause luxation of the head of the os magnum backwards. Ihe slight structure and the looseness of the posterior ligaments, and also the looseness of the synovial membrane behind, explain the facility of the forward motions It IS of importance to remark that the carpal enarthrosis performs a TkriofP-^'* ^^""."^ ^^"'l' then even the radio-carpal arti- of ttie carpus!""" mechanism Metacarpal Articulations. theT^shStf "^-J?^^ ^T' ^'■^.""ite'l at their extremities, but separated alons Jheir S£i exTr'eSs.'"""' articulations, 1. of their carpal, and 2 of TOL. I.194 ARTHROLOGY. 1 Articulations of the Carpal Endji of the Metacarpal Bones. These are symphyses or amphi-arthroses. The articular surfaces {see fig. 73.) occupy the sides of the carpal ends of the metacarpal hones, and are partly contiguous 1 and partly continuous. The contiguous portion consists of a facette covered with cartilage, and is, in fact, an extension of the surface that articulates with the carpus. The part intended to hecome continuous is rough. The means of union are the interosseous, the dorsal, and the palmar ligaments. The interosseous ligaments (//, fig. 73.) are short, close, and very strong handles of fibres, interposed hetween the rough por- tions of the lateral facettes of two neigh- bouring metacarpal bones. They constitute the principal means of uniting these bones, as may be seen by attempting to separate them after dividing the dorsal and pahnar I ligaments. The dorsal {I, fig. 74.) and palmar liga- ' ments{m, fig.1^.) consist of fibrous bundles, stretched transversely from one metacarpal bone to another. The palmar Ugaments are much larger than the dorsal. 2. Articulation of the Digital Ends of the Metacarpal Bones. Although the digital extremities of the metacarpal bones are not, properly speaking, articulated together, yet as they are contiguous, and move upon each ^ ^' ^ other, their surfaces are covered by a sy- novial membrane, which facilitates their movements; moreover, a palmar ligament {n, figs. 74, 75.) is stretched transversely m front of these extremities, and unites them loosely together. This Ugament (called also transverse) is common to the four last metacarpal bones, but it does not reach the metacarpal bone of the thumb. It may be considered as formed by the umon of all the anterior ligaments of the metacarpo-pha- langal articulations, which are rendered continuous by smaU bands stretched from kone to the other. In order to expose this Ugament, it is sufladent to open the fibrous sheaths of the flexor tendons of the fingers, and to remove the smaU lumbricales mus- cles, together with the nerves and vessels of the fingers. We may consider the interosseous apo- neurosity as representing, in respect to the shafts of the metacarpal bones, the apo- neurosis caUed the interosseous ligament in the fore-arm. as we shaU afterwards see, complete the means The interosseous muscles, as we suiui ox of union of the metacarpal bones.

The articular surfaces are the inferior facettes on the bones of the second row of the carpus; and the facettes on the upper ends of the metacarpal bones. We may consider all the carpo-metacarpal articulations as forming only one joint with a broken surface. The articulation of the trapezium with the metacarpal bone of the thumb, and that of the fifth metacarpal bone with the os unciforme, require each a special description. Articulations of the Second, Third, and Fourth Metacarpal Bones with the Carpus. Articular surfaces (see fig. 73.). The articulation of the second, third, and fourth metacarpal bones with the carpus, presents a sinuous line. Proceeding from within outwards, the fourth and third metacarpal bones form a regular curve, with the concavity looking upwards; but the second, which unites by three facettes with the trapezium, the trapezoid, and os magnum, presents an angular surface. The second metacarpal bone is jointed by its transversely concave surface, with a facette on the trapezoid, which is concave, but in the opposite direction, and by two lateral facettes with the os magnum and the trapezium, so that it enters, as it were, into the carpus by two angular pro- jections, which are received into the intervals between the three bones with which it is articulated. From this it follows, that the carpo-metacarpal articu- lations present not only concave and convex surfaces, favourable to mobility, but also angular surfaces that evince the immobility of these joints. Means of union. Some ligaments, distinguished as dorsal and palmar, both very strong, short, and compact, retain the articular surfaces as immoveably in contact, as if the joints were symphyses. The dorsal ligaments are much stronger than the palmar, and are composed of several layers, the deepest being the shortest. There are three dorsal liga- ments for the second metacarpal bone ; a median (o, fig. 74.), stretched to it from the trapezoid bone; an external (p) which comes from the trapezium, and covers the insertion of the extensor carpi radialis longiorj and an internal, arising from the os magnum : the first of these is vertical, the last two are ob- lique. There are two dorsal ligaments in the articulation of the third meta- carpal bone ; a vertical, which comes from the os magnum, and an oblique (r), from the os uncLforme. In the articulation of the fourth metacarpal bone there is one dorsal liga- ment, longer and looser than the preceding. The palmar ligaments are much less marked than the preceding; contrasting thus with the pahnar ligaments of the carpus. There is none for the second metacarpal bone; the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis appears to supply the place of this ligament. There are three ligaments for the third metacarpal bone ; an external, which comes from the trapezium; a middle, proceeding from the OS magnum; and an internal, from the os unciforme. Lastly, for the articu- lation of the fourth metacarpal bone, there is one palmar ligament from the os unciforme. The si/noyial membrane (see fig. 73.) of the carpo-metacarpal articulations is a continuation of the synovial membrane of the carpus, and is prolonged be- tween the upper ends of the metacarpal bones; and as the synovial membrane ot the carpus communicates also with the radio-carpal joint, it can be con- ceived what ravages may be produced by inflammation attacking any one of tnese parts. I must here point out an interosseous, or lateral ligament (I fin 73 ") which arises from the os magnum, and slightly, also, from the os unciforme and IS attached to the inner side of the third metacarpal bone. It almost com- pletely isolates the articulations of the last two metacarpal bones. This \\<r» ment being attached to the third metacarpal bone, which is already proS o 2196 ARTHROLOGY. with very strong ligaments, increases in a remarkable manner the strength of the joint. . . n t.- • Carpo-metacarpal articulation of the thumb. This jomt (m, fig. 73.) which is very distinct and completely separated from all the others, is remarkable, also, for the arrangement of the articular surfaces. There is a mutual jointing be- tween the trapezium, which is concave transversely, and convex from behind forwards; and the first metacarpal bone, which is concave and convex in pre- cisely opposite directions. It is the type of all articulations by mutual reception. The means of union consist of a capsular ligament (s, figs. U&niTo.-), un- perfect on the outside, where its place is occupied occasionally by the tendon of the abductor longus pollicis (extensor ossis metacarpi poUicis): it is much thicker behind than in front, and is sufficiently loose to permit extensive mo- tions in all directions. There is a separate synovial memJrane for this jomt, which is remarkable in respect of its relations: viz, 1. behmd with the ex- tensor muscles of the thumb ; 2. on the outside, with the expanded tendon of the abductor polUcis; 3. on the inside, with the interosseous muscles and the ra^^ artery, where that vessel penetrates into the palm of the hand to form the deep palmar arch; and 4. in front, with the muscles of the ball of the ^^Tarpo-metacarpal articulation of the fifth metacarpal Jone (see fig. 73.)- The articulation of the fifth metacarpal bone with the os unciforme is in man> ™ctT analogous to the preceding; for there is here, also, a sort of mutu^ r cSn betwe'en their corr'espondin'g articular surfaces.

At the same time, the mobility of all the metacarpal bones is not equal. Thus, the articulation of the trapezium with the first metacarpal bone holds the first rank ; it is in some degree differ- ent from the others in this respect as well as in position, and merits particular description. The articulation of the fifth metacarpal bone holds the second place, and that of the fourth the third. The articulations of the second and third metacarpal bones are as immoveable as symphyses. Mechanism of the articulation of the trapezium and the first metacarpal bone. From the mutual reception of the articular surfaces this articulation permits four motions, viz. flexion, extension, abduction and adduction, and as a conse- quence of these, circumduction. Flexion is not performed directly, but obliquely inwards and forwards. This oblique motion produces the movement of opposition which characterises the hand: it is very extensive, and when carried too far may produce luxation backwards, with the greater facility because the capsular ligament is very thin in that direction. Extension may be carried so far that the first metacarpal bone may form a right angle with the radius. It is conceivable that luxation forwards might be produced by this motion ; but there are very few causes that would tend to increase extension to such a degree, and, moreover, the an- terior part of the capsular ligament is extremely strong, so that no example of this luxation has ever been recorded. Abduction is very extensive : when carried beyond a certain point it may give rise to dislocation inwards, for the trapezium, being situated on a plane anterior to the root of the metacarpus, the neighbouring metacarpal bones ofier no obstacle to such a displacement. Lastly, dii'ect adduction is limited by the meeting with the second meta- carpal bone. Mechanism of the articulation of the fifth metacarpal bone with the cuneiform. This articulation in some degree resembles the preceding, and, like the last, it would be liable to dislocation, were it not for its intimate connections with the other metacarpal bones, so that the same cause that would tend to displace the fifth metacarpal bone would also tend to displace the fourth. Ahticulations of the Fingers {figs. 74 and 75.). These comprise 1. the articulations of the fingers with the metacarpal bones; 2. the articulations of the phalanges together. Metacarpo-phalangal Articulations. These belong to the class of condyloid articulations. The articular surfaces in each are formed by the head of the metacarpal bone, flattened from side to side, increasing in breadth from the dorsal to the palmar -aspect, and prolonged much further in the latter direction, where it presents the trace of a division into two condyles ; and by the shallow glenoid cavity of the first phalanx, which is transversely oblong, and consequently has Its long diameter at right angles to that of the head of the metacarpal bone, which IS oblong from before backwards. We see, then, that an articular head elongated from before backwards, is adapted to a transversely oblong cavity inis arrangement favours the movements of flexion and extension, as well as me ateral motions, which are as extensive as they would have been, had aU the longett^'"^ °^ articular surfaces been equal to those which are actuaUy boIlJ""^.^^^ flattening of the heads of the metacarpal "uucb, mat in amputations at these joints surgeons make choice of lateral in preference to antero-posterior flaps. ^ARTHROLOGY. 198 Means of union. On account of the disproportion just noticed as existing between the articular surfaces of this joint, the glenoid cavity of the first phalanx not being equal to more than one half of the articular surface on the metacarpal bone, that cavity is provided with a ligament, called the anterior ligament {u,Jig. 75.) by Bichat, but -which I would denominate the glenoid liga- ment, and which serves principally to complete the cavity of reception. This ligament is situated on the palmar aspect of the joint; it is very thick, and as compact as cartilage; it is formed by intersecting fibres, and is continuous by its edges, partly with the sheaths of the ilexor tendons, partly with the trans- verse metacarpal ligaments, but chiefly with the lateral ligaments of the joint. It is grooved in front to correspond with the flexor tendons, and concave be- hind to fit the convexity of the head of the metacarpal bone ; it is firmly fixed by its lower edge to the anterior margin of the phalangal articular surfaces, of which it appears to form the continuation ; its upper edge is free, or rather very loosely connected by some ligamentous fibres to the inequalities sur- mounting the head of the metacarpal bone in front, and it is so accurately adapted to the contracted neck which supports the head of this bone, that, by this arrangement alone, the articular surfaces are maintained in contact. But there are also two very strong lateral ligaments {v,fgs. 73. and 75.), an internal and an external. These ligaments are insei-ted, not into the lateral depression existing on each side of the head of the metacarpal bones, but into the tu- bercles behind this depression; the ligaments therefore are directed obliquely downwards and forwards, under the form of flattened bands, which become broader, and terminate in the glenoid ligament on the sides of the phalanx. There is no dorsal ligament properly so called; its place is evidently sup- plied by the corresponding extensor tendon (v},Jig. 74.). It is not uncommon to see a small fibrous band extending from the anterior surface of the tendon, and attached to the metacarpal end of the first phalanx. The synovial capsule is extremely loose, especially on the aspect of exten- sion : it does not adhere to the tendon, but is folded upon itself during exten- sion, and is stretched during flexion : It lines the inner surface of the lateral ligaments, and is reflected upon the articular cartilages. Metacarpal-phalangal articulation of the thumb. Two sesamoid bones {t, fins. 73. and 75.), are annexed to this articulation in front, and are constantly found in the glenoid ligament; they afi'ord insertion to the lateral hgaments and to all the short muscles of the thumb. , ^ If we examine these articulations in connection, we shaU find that tney are disposed in a curved line, with the convexity looking downwards. 1 his cur- vature is sUghtly interrupted at the articulation of the fourth metacarpal bone, which is not on a level with those of the index and the middle fingers. Mechanism of the Metacarpo-phalangal Articulations. We shall take as an example the metacarpo-phalangal articulation of the thumb From the arrangement of the articular surfaces, it is evident that tms articulation can execute movements in four principal d^^e^tions and conse- Quentlv those of circumduction also. From a simple inspection of the surfaces U St be inferred that the movement of flexion must be very extensive wlS t that of extension (or flexion backwards) and the lateral motions of Ibduction and adduction must be exceedingjly Umited. The arrangement of the ligaments amply confirms these suppositions.

In extension theARTICULATIONS OF THE FINGERS. 199 o 4 phalanx gUdes backwards upon the head of the metacarpal bone supporting it: this head corresponds almost entirely with the glenoid hgament. The posterior fibres of the lateral ligaments are relaxed, and the anterior stretched. The motion is evidently limited by these anterior fibres and by the glenoid hga- ment, the upper edge of which forms with them a narrow ring that surrounds the neck of the corresponding metacarpal bone. According to the relative size of this ring, and the comparative looseness of the glenoid ligament, will the movement of extension be more or less con- siderable. In all persons it may be carried so far, as to form an obtuse angle behind; in some, untU a right angle is formed; and m a few, even so far as to produce an incomplete luxation, reducible by the slightest muscular effort. If extension be carried beyond these limits (for which, however considerable violence is necessary) the head of the metacarpal bone escapes from the kind of coUar, formed by the superior border of the glenoid ligaments, and the an- terior fibres of the lateral ligaments, sometimes by extensively lacerating it, but at others only by stretching it very much; in both cases the first phalanx is dislocated backwards, or the metacarpal bone forwards. When the coUar is not torn, reduction is almost impossible, because the glenoid ligament is al- ways interposed between the articular surfaces. Adduction and abduction consist of simple lateral glidings, limited by the meeting of the other fingers. Articulations of the Phalanges of the Fingers. These are puUey-like joints, or perfect angular ginglymi. There are two articulations of this kind in each finger, but only one in the thumb. Articular surfaces. The lower end of the first phalanx, flattened from be- fore backwards, presents a trochlea, broader on the palmar than on the dorsal aspect, and prolonged much further in front than behind. The trochlea of the phalanx resembles the lower end of the femur, with this difference, that its two condyles are not separated from each other. The upper end of the second phalanx, also flattened from before backwards, presents two small glenoid cavities separated by an antero-posterior ridge. The ridge corresponds to the groove of the pulley, and the glenoid cavities to the two condyles. Means of union. 1. A glenoid ligament i_y,fig. 74.), exactly resembling that which exists in the metacarpo-phalangal articulations, and performing the same office of deepening the glenoid cavity, which by itself only imperfectly receives the pulley of the first phalanx. 2. Two lateral ligaments, an internal (2), and an external (z'), arranged precisely in the same manner as the lateral liga- ments of the metacarpo-phalangal articulations. They are attached to tubercles situated behind the lateral depressions, on the lower end of the first phalanx, and pass obliquely forwards, to be inserted both into the glenoid ligament and the second phalanx. There is no posterior ligament, its place being supplied by the extensor tendon. This tendon is disposed in a peculiar manner: in gen- eral, it gives off a prolongation (w) from its anterior aspect, which is inserted into the upper end of the second phalanx, so that this bone presents a some- what similar arrangement behind, as it does in front with the flexor tendon. The synovial capsule is precisely similar to that of the metacarpo-phalangal joints. The foregoing description applies equally well to the articulation of the second with the third phalanx. There is often a sesamoid bone in the substance of the glenoid ligament of the two phalangal joints of the thumb. Mechanism of the Phalanges. Thefingers are essentially the organs of prehension and of touch. In the mechanism of touch the fingers are moved over the surfaces of bodies, and are moulded upon even their slightest inequalities, sometimes acting together, sometimes separately, seizing and moving between them, as between the blades ot sentient forceps, even the most delicate objects. For the performance of this200 ARTHROLOGY. function great mobility must be conjoined with great precision of movement. On the other hand, for the purpose of seizing bodies, of retaining, repulsing, or breaking them, as well as of acting as the means of attack and defence, consi- derable power is required ; all which qualities are united in the mechanism of the hand. Observe the number of the fingers and their complete isolation, so that they can act either together or separately, and even in opposite directions. Notice the number of the phalanges, their successive decrease in size, and the facility with which they can be separated or made to approach each other, so as to be applied around spherical bodies. Note also the inequality of the fingers in length and power, enabling each to act a determinate part in prehension; and above all, remark the shortness of the thumb, which only reaches the base of the first phalanx of the index finger ; but which, placed as it is upon a plane anterior to the rest, and endowed with a greater degree of mobility, can be op- posed to all the fingers together, to each finger separately, and to every phalanx of each, thus constituting the principal blade of the sentient forceps represented by the hand ; for, being more strongly constructed, and provided with more powerful muscles than the other fingers, it in some degree counterbalances them all. Mechanism of the Phalangal Articulations. From the shape of the articular surfaces, which form a miniature representa- tion of the knee, it is evident that the only motions of which these joints are capable are flexion and extension. The flexion of the second upon the first phalanx is as extensive as it could possibly be, for it is only limited by the meeting of the anterior surfaces of these bones. The amount oiflexion of the third phalanx upon the second is less considerable. The extension of the second phalanx upon the first, and that of the third upon the second, are limited, as in the metacarpo-phalangal joints, by the anterior glenoid and the lateral ligaments. This motion of the phalanges is extremely slight; I have never seen them carried further back than to form a straight line. From what has been observed it follows that, as regards its movements, each finger represents a shortened or miniature limb ; that, at its articulation with the metacarpus, it is capable of motions in every direction, and also of circumduc- tion ; that, from the joints between the phalanges, it is endowed with the power of strong, extensive, and accurate flexion ; and that, from the double bending of the second upon the first, and the third upon the second phalanges, the fingers represent a true hook for seizing and clinging to external objects.

The contiguous surfaces of these two bones are anterior to the others, and are shaped like an ear, with the convex edge turned forwards ; hence they are called the auricular surfaces. The parts which are rendered continuous by means of ligamentous fibres consist of the entire space comprised between the auricular portion and the posterior border of the OS innominatum, and of all the lateral surface of the sacrum not occu- pied by the auricular facette. The continuous portions are both marked with very rugged eminences and depressions. These articular surfaces are aJso re- markable from being sinuous and alternately concave and convex, and from their presenting a well-marked obliquity in two directions, viz. from above downwards, and from before backwards and inwards, so that the sacrum is, as it were, wedged between the ossa innominata both in a vertical and an antero- posterior direction. Means of union. The auricular surfaces are covered with cartilage, which is thicker upon the sacrum than on the os innominatiun, and is remarkable for the roughness of its surface, which contrasts with the smooth appearance of other articular cartilages. There is a distinct synovial membrane in this joint in the infant and pregnant female, but it can scarcely be detected in the adult and the aged. The ligaments are, 1. an anterior sacro-iliac ligament (b,figs. 76, 77.) — a very thin layer which passes in front of this articulation, |sFi;;.76. and composed of fibres stretched transversely from the gacrum to the ilium. 2. A superior sacro-iliac ligament {4:, fig. 52.)—a very thick bundle, extending transversely from the base of the sacrum to the contiguous portion of the ilium. 3. An interosseous ligament, which forms the strongest bond of union in this joint, composed of a great number of ligamentous fibres, stretched horizontally from the Uium to the sacrum, crossing each other, and filling up almost the whole of the deep excavation com- prised between the two bones ; these fibres leave small intervals between them ■which are occupied by fat, and traversed by numerous small veins. One of these bundles merits a special description : it consists of a long and strong band extending almost vertically from the posterior superior spinous process of the ihum to a thick tubercle on the third sacral vertebra; it may be called the posterior vertical sacro-iliac ligament. 4. The ilio-lumbar ligament {c, figs. 76, 77.) may be considered as belonging to this joint; it extends from the summit of the transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra to the thickest part of the crest of the ilium, that is, to the enlargement situated about two inches in front °*^^^POsterior superior iliac spine. It is a thick and very strong triangular Symphysis Pubis. Preparation.

They are therefore separated by a triangular interval, the base of which is directed forwards, and the apex backwards. We should observe con- cerning this articulation, that there are many varieties in the respective extent of the contiguous and continuous portions of the articular surfiices. Some- times they are almost whoUy continuous; at other times, on the contrary, they are nearly altogether contiguous. I have observed this latter disposition in a very remarkable degree in the symphysis of a young woman who died in the sixth month of pregnancy. . ,. The means of union are the following:—-1. An anterior pubic ligament (d fiq 7G) —a. very thin fibrous layer, the posterior portion of which is blended with the interosseous ligament: it is composed of fibres extending from the spine of each os pubis obliquely to the anterior surface of the opposite pubic bone; those from the left side pass in front of those from the right. 2. A posterwr pubic ligament, extremely thin, and covering the prominence formed by the ossa pu- bis behind, at the place of their articulation. This prominence, which is very marked in old subjects, seems to be produced by a jutting out of the posterior table of the bone backwards, apparently caused by the pressure of one articular surface upon the other; these surfaces being, as we have described, in contact behind but separate in front. In a female who died of peritonitis soon after delivery, I found this posterior prominence of the pubes formmg a sort of spine of some Unes in diameter from before backwards. 3. A superior pubic hga- ment (e fiq. 76.), very thick, and continuous on each side with a fibrous cord, that covers the upper edge of the os pubis, and effaces its irregularities. 4. An inferior pubic or triangular ligament (f,fig. 76.), which is exceedingly strong; it forms a continuation of the anterior and interosseous hgaments, and is corn- nosed of interlacing fibres : this Ugament renders the angle formed by the ossa TuS obtuse, and gives to the arch of the pubes that regular curve presented by it to the head of the foetus during labour. 5. An interosseous (>'^f; J which occupies the whole non-contiguous portion of the art cular surtaces, Ind vari^sTeatly in thickness in different individuals.

Its upper edge is continuous with the aponeurosis, extending over the pyriformis muscle. It is covered by the gluteus maximus, to which it af- fords insertions, and is situated posteriorly to the small sacro-sciatic ligament. Thesmall sacro-sciatic ligament(m, figs. 76,77.), placed in front of the preceding, and ex- tremely thin, arises from the summit of the spine of the ischium, passes inwards, and be- coming thinner, is lost upon the anterior surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament. The two sacro-sciatic ligaments divide the great sacro- sciatic notch into two distinct foramina: the upper (n,fig.77.) is very large, and shaped like a triangle with the angles rounded ofP, and is in a great measure filled up by the coccygeus and pyriformis muscles ; it gives passage also to the great and small sciatic nerves, to the ischiatic vessels and to the gluteal and internal pudic vessels and nerves, and to a large quantity of cel- lular tissue. That form of hernia which is called sciatic takes place through this foramen. The lower {o,fig. 77.) is much smaller it is situated between the spine and tuberosity of the ischium, and gives passage to the obturator in- temus muscle, and to the internal pudic vessels and nerves. Mechanism of the Pelvis. The mechanism of the pelvis should be regarded in four distinct points of view!— 1. as affording protection to the contained viscera ; 2. in relation to the part which it performs in the mechanism of standing and progression; 3. in connection with the phenomena of parturition ; and 4. in reference to the motions which take place at its articulations with other bones, and those between its own component parts. 1. Mechanism of the pelvis considered as a protecting structure. The following are the conditions in the structure of the pelvis, having reference to its office as a protector of the contained viscera: —1. behind; the presence of the sacrum, which is itself protected, as well as the nerves that pass through it, by the great prominence of the posterior iliac tuberosities which project considerably be- yond it; 2. on the sides, by the crest of the ilium, and the prominence of the trochanters, which so often preserve the pelvis from external violence; 3. in front, the means of protection are much less efficacious, in consequence of the vast notch which is situated in this region. The partial absence of the bony parietes in front has reference to the great variations in size which the viscera of the pelvis can undergo, and which would have been incompatible with the existence of an osseous cincture, incapable of dilatation. The absence of bony walls in the situation of the three great notches, presented by the outlet of the pelvis, is also unfavourable to its so- lidity ; but it has many other important uses, particularly in the mechanism of labour. The pelvis, especially at its upper part, where it is most exposed to injury, is enabled to resist external violence by virtue of its vaulted construc- tion. Part of the impulse also is lost in producing the slight degree of gliding motion permitted at the symj)hysis pubis. Where, however, the power of re- sistance possessed by the pelvis is overcome, it will be seen at once that the parts most liable to fracture are the ascending rami of the ischia at their junc- tion with the descending rami of the ossa pubis. 2. Mechanism of the pelvis with regard to standing and progression. The part204 ARTHROLOGY. performed by the pelvis in standing is connected with the transmission of the weight of the trunk to the lower extremities ; this is effected by means of the sacrum, which rests upon the ossa innominata. We should add, that a amall ' portion of the weight is directly transmitted to the femora by the iliac bones, which support the viscera of the abdomen; and in regard to this I would re- mark, that the breadth and separation of the iliac fossa? m man, as compared with other animals, have an evident relation to his erect posture. The following arrangements should be noted as bemg concerned m the trans- mission of the weight by means of the sacrum:-!. The great size of that bone, affording evidence of the destination of man for the erect posture. 2. The ob- tuse angle at which the sacrum unites with the vertebral column, peculiar to the human species, and which becomes the seat of a decomposition of the force transmitted by the spine. Part of the momentum acting in the direction of the axis of the column, has no other effect than that of increasing the sacro- vertebral angle, at the expense of the flexibility of the inter-articulai; cartilage ; the rest is transmitted to the sacrum, and then to tlie lower extremities 3. The double wedge shape of the sacrum itself. In order to understand the advantage arming from this form, it is necessary to remark, first, that the weight of the trunk is transmitted in the axis of the upper half of the sacrum, and, conse- quently, in the direction of a line sloping downwards and backwards: from this it follows, that the sacrum must have a tendency to be displacea either downwards or backwards, but the displacement downwards is F^^e^t^dby the position of the ossa innominata, which are I^^arer to each other below than above.

In order to complete our account of the mechaiiism of the P^l^^ m stand- ing, we must examine its mode of resistance m falls upon the knees or soles of the feet. In this case, the shock is communicated from below upwards to the upper halves of the cotyloid cavities, which are supported by the prismatic columns already described. The anterior part of each acetabulum presents a large notch, and is altogether unconcerned in the transmission of these shocks; so also is the very thin lamina, constituting the bottom or inner wall of the cavity, which can only suffer compression in faUs upon the great trochanter Diu-ing progression the pelvis affords to each thigh alternately a sohd fulcrum, and receives itself a fixed point of support from the femur of that leg which rests upon the ground. While one side of the pelvis is thus supported upon one of the thigh bones, the other side is projected forwards. These al- ternate movements of projection of either side of the pelvis are much more marked in the female than in the male, and take place at the coxo-femoral articulation of the limb resting upon the ground. 3. Mechanism of the pelvis with regard to parturition. The art of midwifery depends in a great measure upon the study of the pelvis; it is impossible to form a true conception of the mechanism of natural labour, without being acquainted with the axes of the pelvis, its dimensions as compared with the size of the foetus, the sacro-vertebral angle, the inclined planes of the true pelvis, the diameters of the brim and the outlet, and the malformations to which it is liable, Any lengthened details upon these points would be out of place here. I shall only remark, 1. that the existence of the arch of the pubes is peculiar to the human species; and 2. that the sciatic notches and the obturator foramina are not only useful from economising weight, but also he- cause, corresponding as they do to the oblique diameters of the head of the foetus during parturition, they, render less painftd the pressure attendant upon that process. 4. Mechanism of the pelvis with regard to its own movements. The intrinsic movements of the pelvis are very obscure,- being confined to mere gliding motions, the production of which destroys part of the momentum from any external violence. The mobility of the intrinsic articulations of the pelvis is considerably increased during the latter periods of pregnancy, so that the coccyx may be pressed backwards, causing an increase of five or six lines in the antero-posterior diameter of the outlet; whilst the symphysis pubis * be- comes susceptible of a slight separation, which increases (in a very slight degree, it is true, but sufficiently to merit notice) the dimensions of the brim of this cavity. The extrinsic movements of the pelvis are those of flexion, extension, la- teral inclination, and rotation : these are performed upon the vertebral co- lumn, and are all very limited. The motions of the pelvis upon the thighs are very considerable : they will be examined with the mechanism of the hip joint. COXO-TEMORAL Akticulation (fig. 76.). Preparation. Remove with care all the muscles that surround the joint, * In a female, seventy-nine years of age, the mother of nineteen children, I found the symphysis pubis extremely moveable : the two articular surfaces were contiguous ; the inferior ligament had disappeared; and a very thick fibrous capsule of recent formation surrounded the articular surfaces in front, above, and below, being inserted at some distance from them.206 ARTHROLOGY. preserving the reflected tendon of the rectus femoris. This articulation is the type of the order enarthrosis, being a tme hall and socket joint. The articular surfaces are the globular head of the femur, and the cotyloid cavity of the os innominatum. There is a striking difference between this joint and that of the shoulder, as far as regards the size of the articular head and the depth of the articular cavity. Both of the surfaces above-named are covered with cartilage, with the exception of two depressions, one of which is situated on the head of the femur, the other at the bottom of the cotyloid cavity ; the latter is filled with a reddish adipose tissue, improperly called the cotyloid gland. It is analogous to the adipose tissue fouiid in the neighbour- hood of all the joints: its use is not well known; perhaps it is intended to protect the thin bottom of the cotyloid cavity from the effects of shocks or pressure. rr,,. • ■ , , Means of union. The cotyloid ligaments (n, fig. 76.). This ligament is attached to the margin of the acetabulum, which it as it were completes : it augments the depth of the cavity, and renders smooth its sinuous and notched circum- ference. It is of greater size at the notches than in any other part: by its means the irregularities of the edge of the acetabulum are effaced, and the deep notch in front and below is converted into a foramen for the passage of vessels to the fatty tissue and the interarticular ligament. It is much thicker above and behind than below and in front, and it is pre- cisely against the first two points that the head of the femur constantly presses. It is also remarkable in this respect, that the diameter of its free borders is smaller than that by which it is attached, and this circumstance assists in some degree in retaining the head of the femur in the cotyloid cavity. It consists of fibres which arise successively from aU points of the circumference of the acetabulum, and interlace at very acute angles. This interlacement is especially visible in the situation of the great anterior notch, where the fibres may be seen arising from each side of the notch, and passing across each other. The capsular or orbicular ligament (p,fig. 76.). This represents a fibrous sac having two openings, by one of which it embraces the acetabulum, outside the cotyloid ligament, whilst the other surrounds the neck of the femur. The femoral insertion of the capsular ligament requires to be carefuUy studied for the purpose of explaining the difference between fractures within, and frac- tures beyond, the capsule. This insertion is so arranged that at the "pper pai t of the joint, it corresponds with the base of the neck of the femur, whUe be- neath it is situated at the junction of the external with the two in ernal thirds of the neck The length of the capsular hgament is exactly equal to the dis- tance between its insfrtions, excepting at the inner part, where it is much Sore loose. Hence the extent of the motion of abduction, which is so re- markable in some jugglers that they are able to separate their legs, until they form right angles with the body, without producmg disloca ion.

The internal surface is hned by *Vh?cSllar U^ment of the hip joint differs from the generaUty of such structures in beini of a dull white, instead of a pearly ^^te colour and m being composed of irregularly interlaced mstead of parallel fibres. I have also observed a very remarkable fact, apparently overlooked by anatomists, viz. that it is extremely thin at both its orifices, but especially at the lower ; that near this insertion it is strengthened by some circular fibres which em- brace the neck of the bone like a coUar, but without adhermg to it; and that in its different movements this sort of collar roUs round the neck, but is re- tained in its place by smaU bundles of fibres reflected from the capsule upon the neck of the bone, which raise the synovial membrane from the surface. The interarticular or round ligament {t. Jig. 76.). This ligament arises from the depression on the head of the femur, becomes wider, and divides into two bundles, which are fijced to the edges of the cotyloid notch. The thickness and the strength of this interarticular ligament are extremely variable; sometimes it adheres to one edge only of the notch; sometimes it consists merely of a few ligamentous fibres, contained within the substance of the reflected synovial membrane; sometimes there is nothing but a fold of that membrane which may be torn by the slightest force; and lastly, it is not uncommon to find that it is altogether wanting. The synovial membrane Hnes the whole internal surface of the capsular liga- ment, the two non-adhering surfaces of the cotyloid ligament, and that part of the neck of the femur contained within the joint; it embraces the round liga- ment, and sends off a prolongation from it to the fatty matter, at the bottom of the acetabulum, an arrangement which led the older anatomists to believe that the round ligament was inserted into the bottom of the cotyloid cavity Mechanism of the Coxo-femoral Articulation. Like all enarthroses, the coxo-femoral articulation can execute movements of flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction, and rotation. 1. Inflexion, the head of the femur rolls in the cotyloid cavity around an imaginary axis corresponding with that of the neck of the bone. The lower end of the femur is carried from behind forwards, and describes the segment of a circle, whose radius is represented by the shaft of the bone. In the me - chanism of this movement, the neck of the femur has the effect of substituting a rotatory motion of the head of that bone upon a fixed point, in which there is no tendency to displacement, for a very extensive movement backwards and forwards, which would otherwise have been necessary, and in which the sur- faces would have been liable to separation from each other. We can indeed scarcely beUeve that luxation would be possible during this motion, although it can be carried so far that the front of the thigh and the fore part of the abdomen may be brought in contact. 2. Extension is effected by the same mechanism, but such is the obliquity of the acetabulum, which looks both forwards, outwards, and downwards, that when the femur is in the vertical direction, the head projects and carries for- wards the fibrous capsule. The anterior reinforcing bundle is stretched. The psoas and iliacus muscles perform the office of an active ligament. Luxations of the femur forwards are not common, for the movement of extension is limited by the meeting of the edge of the acetabulum and the back part of the neck of the femur; and the ligament and muscles above named also tend to counteract it. 3 and 4. The mechanism of adduction and abduction is altogether different from that of the preceding movements, where the articulation forms the centre of a circle described by the femur, the radius of which is measured by a line stretched from the head of the bone to the space between the condyles. InARTHROLOGY. 208 abduction, the head of the femur presses against the inner part of the capsular ligament; and, on account of the looseness of this ligament, the obliquity of the acetabulum, and the arrangement of the interarticular ligament, this move- ment may be carried very far without displacement, and is only limited by the meeting of the upper edge of the neck of the femur, -with the rim of the coty- loid cavity. But this very meeting may itself become the cause of luxation, and then the edge of the cotyloid cavity may be regarded as the fulcrum of a lever of the first order with unequal arms, the whole length of the femur being the arm, to which the power is applied, and the neck of the bone, that by which the resistance acts. In adduction, the femur moves in precisely the opposite direction: this motion is limited by the mutual contact of the two thighs, but "by means of slight flexion it may be carried so far as to throw one over the other. The great depth of the upper and external part of the cotyloid cavity, and the strength of the capsular ligament in the same directions, would seem to oppose all displace- ment. But it should be observed that falls upon the knees almost always happen during adduction of the thighs, for this is an instinctive movement of preserv- ation. However slight the adduction may be, the interarticular ligament is of necessity stretched; and from this it follows, as M. Gerdy has remarked, that the head of the femur is detached from the bottom of the cavity, by a kind of rolling of the round ligament upon it, and comes to press against the fibrous capsule. It may be conceived that luxation is necessarily preceded by ruptui-e of the interarticular ligament. 5. Circumduction consists in the transition from one of these motions to another. The femur circumscribes a cone, of which the apex is in the joint, whilst the base is described by the lower end of that bone. 6. Independently of the movements above described, the coxo-femoral ar- ticulation performs motions of rotation. This movement should be studied, both at the upper and at the lower part of the femur. At the upper part it is a motion of horizontal displacement, the radius being represented by the head and neck of the bone ; at the lower part it is a rotatory motion of the femur, not precisely upon itself, but upon an imaginary axis placed on the inside of, and parallel to, the shaft. It follows, that there can be no rotation in cases of fracture of the neck of the bone, and this is one of the diagnostic signs of that accident. Lastly, it may be observed that rotation is performed from without inwards, or from, within outwards: the latter is the more extensive and more natural movement; it is produced by a great number of muscles, and therefore during repose the point of the foot is slightly inclined outwards. The Knee Joint {figs. 78. to 81.). Preparation. 1. Make a crucial incision in front of the knee and dissect back the flaps. 2. Detach the aponeurosis of the thigh, preserving the fibrous band, which forms the continuation of the tensor vaginae femoris. 3. Remove the aponeurosis of the triceps on the sides of the patella, taking care to avoid opening the synovial capsule. 4. Remove the tendon of the biceps, and turn downwards the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus. 5. Re- move the popliteal vessels and nerves behind, and also the gastrocnemiL 6. After having studied the ligaments situated around the synovial capsule, iso- late the latter as much as possible by dissecting off the lateral ligaments, and the ligamentum patellae. 7. Open the synovial capsule above the patella. 8. Make ahorizontal section of the femur immediately above the condyles, and a vertical section from before backwards between the condyles. These two sections are intended to expose the crucial ligaments. The articulation of the knee belongs to the class of angular ginglymi. it is the largest and most complicated joint in the himian body. Articular surfaces. The lower end of the femur and the upper end of the tibia are the essential constituents of this joint, which is completed in front byARTICULATIONS OF THE KNEE JOINT. 209 Fig 78. the patella. The articular surfece of the femur is formed in front by the trochlea; and behind by the two condyles, separated by the intercondyloid fossa; the articular surface of the tibia consists of the glenoid cavities, sepa- rated by the spine of the tibia, in front of and behind which are some irregular projections. The patella presents two concave surfaces, separated from each other by a vertical ridge corresponding to the groove of the trochlea. These surfaces are all covered with a thick layer of cartilage. It should be re- marked with regard to the knee-joint, 1. that the articular surfaces are ra,ther placed in juxta-position, than jointed together; 2. that the articulation is in some measure double, since two very distinct condyles correspond to two equally distinct cavities. Inter-articular cartilages. Like all joints that are exposed to much pressure, the knee is provided with inter-articular cartilages. They are two in number, and are named from their figure semilunar or fal- ciform cartilages b, fig. T 8.). Their upper sur- faces, corresponding to the convexity of the con- dyles, are concave; their external circumference is very thick, and the internal sharp and thin: they therefore assist in deepening the concave surfaces of the tibia. The external inter-articular cartilage (a) covers almost the whole of the external gle- noid cavity of the tibia, forming nearly a complete circle; while the internal cartilage (b) leaves a great part of the corresponding cavity uncovered. In this respect the inter-articular cartilages of the knee differ from all others of the same kind, for they do not establish a complete separation of the articular surfaces, between which they are placed. The external is attached by both extremities be- tween the two projections that form the spine of the tibia; the anterior extremity of the internal cartilage is fixed in front of the spine, and the posterior extremity behind it; and hence, as these cartilages are inserted into the tibia, they accompany it in all its movements. A transverse fibrous band, called the transverse ligament, unites them in front; and from the external inter-articular cartilage, a very thick bundle of fibres proceeds backwards, which adds greatly to the strength of the posterior crucial ligament, and is inserted behind it into the internal condyle of the femur. The means of union are two lateral, a posterior, an anterior, two crucial liga- ments, and a synovial capsule. The external lateral ligament (a, figs. 79 and 80.) extends from a small emi- nence, which separates two depressions on the back part of the external tuber- osity of the femur, to the outside of the head of the fibula. This ligament has the rounded form, and the appearance of a tendon; it is situated in front of the tendon of the biceps, which covers it below, and embraces it by its bifurcation. The internal lateral ligament (h c,figs. 79 and 80.) extends from the back of the internal tuberosity of the femur, below the tubercle for the adductor mag- uus to the inner edge and internal surface of the tibia. It consists of a broad and thm band, covered at its lower part by the tendons of the sartorius, gra- cilis, and semitendinosus muscles, a synovial bursa intervening. Its deep sur- lace is applied to the anterior tendon of the semi-membranosus, and adheres intimately to the inter-articular cartilage. The lateral ligaments are situated much nearer to the back than to the fore part of the joint, so that they are siretctiea during extension, and assist in limitmg that motion, but are relaxed, auring flexion, to the performance of which they offer no obstacle. ine;joste;7or ligament (or ligament of Winslow) is composed of several sets fhrmpfw , 79 and 81.) pass obliquely upwards and outwards, being toiraea by a considerable expansion of the semi-membranosus; others proceedARTHROLOGY. 210 from the tendons of the popliteus and gastrocnemius; and, lastly, some fibrous Fig.K. fig.80. bundles, partly vertical and partly oblique, arise from above the con- dyles of the femur, and are at- tached to the tibia. From this col- lection of fibres running in differ- ent directions, there results an irregularly interwoven ligament perforated by foramina that trans- mit the ramifications of the middle articular artery: several of the most deeply-seated ligamentous bundles are inserted into the edges of the inter-articular cartilages. But in addition to these fibres, which especially constitute the posterior ligament, there is also a sort of semi-capsular fibrous membrane co- vering the back of each condyle; it is closely united to the tendons of the gastrocnemius and plan- taris muscles, which, indeed, may be regarded as forming active pos- terior ligaments of the knee-joint. The sesamoid bone of the ex- ternal head of the gastrocnemius, when it exists, is found in the sub- stance of the external semi-capsule. The anterior ligament {d,figs. 80 and 81.), or ligamentum patellse, is that portion of the common ten- don of the extensor muscles which passes between the patella and the tibia. It is very broad, thick, and almost triangular, and is continu- ous in front of the patella with the tendon of the extensor muscles, by ^ means of a superficial layer of J'^ ''- iections behind the apex, and it proceeds contractmg ^ is it descends, to the most prominent and lowest part of the anterior tubercle of the tibia. Belund ;his bga- ment there is a considerable quantity of fatty matt^^^ (e, fig. 81.), which separates it from the articular and synovial membrane 5 and a very distinct bursa (/) separates it from that portion of the anterior tubercle , "'"'^Z^^S^eousUga.r^ts. In the interior of the knee-joint there are two interosseous hgaments (ai Z h.), so arranged as to admit of the most ex- en ive flexion, but to Ibnit the movement of extension They are called crucial, because they cross each other ike Ae letter X. They are situated m the deep in- er:condyloid fossa. The anterior (9, figs. , 8. and 81.) arises from the external condyle and passes to the Kart of the spine of the tibia. The ;,os<«nar (,^,. 78.) arises from [rSemal cOnd/le, and is fixed to the back part of211 ARTICULATIONS OF THE KNEE JOINT. P 2 the spine, and also to the external semilunar cartilage. The names anterior and posterior have been taken from their insertions, for at their origins the anterior is attached behind the external, and the posterior in front of the internal condyle. From their obliquity, and their situation nearer to the back part of the joint, they are well adapted for limiting the movement of extension, during which their points of insertion are separated, whilst during flexion they are approximated. The synovial capsule of this joint is the largest and the most complicated of all that exist in the body. In tracing it from the upper edge of the patella we find, behind the tendon of the extensor muscles, a large cul-de-sac is, Jig. 81.), sometimes replaced by a distinct synovial capsule, interposed between that tendon and the surface of the femur. In some subjects, this bursa communi- cates with the synovial capsule of the knee-joint by a more or less considerable opening, and in such cases a circular constriction forms the only trace of se- paration. On each side of the patella the synovial membrane extends beneath the two vasti, but particularly beneath the vastus internus. The existence of these two prolongations affords an explanation of the swellings observed at the sides of the knee in dropsy of this joint; and the greater extent of the internal prolongation explains also the greater size of the prominence on the inner side. In the intercondyloid notch the synovial membrane envelopes the cru- cial ligaments; then it is reflected upon the posterior ligament, the lateral ligaments, the semilunar cartilages, the articular surfaces of the tibia, and, lastly, the back of the ligamentum patellse ; it next sends off a prolongation, containing a few ligamentous fibres, and extending from the lower border of the patella to the front of the intercondyloid notcli. This fold has been incor- rectly termed the adipose ligament (ligamentum mucosum, i,figs. 78. and 81.). After having fui-nished this fold, tie synovial membrane lines the posterior surface of the patella, and becomes continuous with the cul-de-sac behind the extensor tendon. Sometimes the prolongation, known as the adipose ligament, does not exist; at other times there is more than one. I have seen a fold of the same nature extending from that part of the synovial membrane which lines the extensor tendon to the surface of the femur above the trochlea. No other synovial membrane in the body is provided with so large a number of villous prolongations, which, in some subjects, may be said to give it a shaggy appear- ance ; they are especiaUy met with around the patella * and the semilunar cartilages. To these prolongations Clopton Havers has given the name of synovial fringes. Some deep fibres of the triceps cruris have been regarded as a special tensor muscle of the synovial capsule. (Vide Triceps Cruris Myology.) ' _ Sub-synovial adipose tissue. From the abundance of this tissue in the knee- joint, its disposition requires some special notice. It is chiefly met with behind the ligamentum patellae {e,fig. 81.), where it forms a very thick layer, tiUmg up the interval between the patella and the synovial membrane A great quantity is also found behind the tendon of the triceps, above the condyles where It occupies the space brtween that tendon and the corresponding part of the femur. Lastly, it is found around the condyles in the inter-condyloid iossa, surrounding the insertions of the crucial ligaments.

With regard to strength. The strength of articulations is generally in direct proportion to the extent of the articular surfaces, and there is no jomt more advantageously constructed in this respect than the one we have been examining. The reception of the spine of the tibia into the inter-condyloid fossa also tends greatly to increase the strength of the joint, although it forms hut an imperfect kind of dove-tailing. A third and last condition conducive to strength is the multiplicity of the ligaments. 2. With regard to mobility. The knee being a hmge-jomt has two principal movements, in opposite directions, viz./erioreand extension; but as the mutual reception of the surfaces is very imperfect, it is also capable of some slight rotatory motions. Inflexion, the sui-faces of the tibia, defended by their mter-artieular carti- laa-es, glide backwards upon the condyles of the femur: and from the great extent of the articular surfaces of the last bone in that direction, the move- ment can be carried so far as to permit the leg and thigh to touch. In this movement, the lateral, the posterior, and the crucial hgaments are relaxed ; the ligamentum patella is stretched; the patella is firmly applied to the front of the joint, and can neither be moved to the right nor to the left, as may be done during extension. In the position of flexion, the patella fiUs up, as it were, the great hiatus then existing at the front of the jomt between the femur and the tibia. Luxation is impossible during this movement, which is only limited by the mutual contact of the leg and the thigh. _ In extension, the tibia and the inter-articular cartilages ghde m the opposite direction. The movement is arrested when the leg is m the same Ime as the thiffh, and whatever muscular effort be then made, the leg can never pass that limit, excepting from malformation of the parts. A greater amourit of extension is renderfd impossible, both by the shape of the articular surfaces and by the stretching of all the U^aments, excepting that of the Pf'J^ ^^",^1 is completely relaxed, and permits of a great lateral mobility of that bone ^e circumstance in the shape of the articular surfaces, opposed to any extens on beyond the straight Une, is the smaU extent of the trochlea in front; for could such extension lake place, the glenoid cavities of the tibia would then be awHed to a portion of the trochlea, much smaller than themselves.

Its other and chief uses are connected with the functions of the triceps extensor muscle, m the tendon of which it is developed. It is moveable and depressed durmg ex- tension of the leg, but during flexion it becomes prominent and faxed. Eolation. When the leg is semi-flexed upon the thigh, it can be very slightly rotated inwards and outwards. These movements are performed not upon the external but upon the internal condyle as a pivot, so that the external part of the head of the tibia glides forwards during rotation inwards, and back- wards during rotation outwards. The difference in the part performed by the two condyles in the movement of rotation, does not depend upon any peculi- arity of structure in the joint, but exclusively upon the arrangement of the acting forces, as we shall see when treating of the muscles. Rotation inwards is limited by the mutual contact of the crucial ligaments, whose decussation is increased during this movement. Rotation outwards is more extensive, be- cause in this movement the ligaments are uncrossed and become parallel. We shall see hereafter that the biceps is the agent of rotation outwards, and the popliteus of rotation inwards. Peroneo-tibiai- Akticulations (Jigs. 79 and 80.). Preparation. 1. Remove carefully the muscles of the anterior and posterior regions of the leg, which will expose the interosseous ligament, and the an- terior and posterior ligaments of these joints. 2. In order to see the interior of the articulations, saw through the two bones in the middle, and then sepa- rate them. 3. To gain an idea of the interosseous ligament of the inferior articulation, saw perpendicularly through the lower ends of the bones of the leg so as to divide them into an anterior and a posterior portion. The tibia and the fibula, which are contiguous at their extremities, are sepa- rated from each other along their shafts, the interval being occupied by an aponeurosis, improperly called the interosseous ligament. We have, then, a supe- rior and an inferior peroneo-tibial articulation, and an interosseous ligament or aponeurosis. 1. Superior Peroneo-tibial Articulation. This articulation is an arthrodia. The articular facette of the tibia, looking downwards and outwards, is situated behind its external tuberosity. The fa- cette of the fibula looks upwards and inwards; it occupies the inner part of the upper end of the bone. The means of union are two ligaments — an anterior ig,fig. 80.) and a posterior (d,fig. 79.). They are composed of parallel fibres, directed obliquely downwards and outwards from the external condyle of the tibia, to the head of the fibula. There is generally a distinct synovial mem- brane for this joint, but sometimes it is a prolongation from the capsule of the knee. 2. Inferior Peroneo-tibial Articulation. This articulation is an amphiarthrosis, that is, it is formed between surfaces that are partly contigw)us, and partly continuous. The former consists of two articular facettes, narrow from above downwards, and oblong from before backwards; of these one is convex, and situated upon the internal surface of the lower end of the fibula above the malleolus; the other is concave and contmuous with the inferior or tarsal articular surface of the tibia. They are both covered with cartilage. The continuous surfaces are rough and much more extensive; they are triangular in shape, having their bases directed down- wards : the one situated upon the fibula is convex, that upon the tibia is slightlv concave. o j The means of union are, two ligaments external to the joint, and an interos- seous ligament connecting the two triangular surfaces just mentioned. Of the two external ligaments, one is anterior (i,fig. 80,), and the other posterior V 3214 ARTHROLOGY. {e,fig. 79.)- They are both very strong, and composed of thick, shining, parallel fibres, which pass obliquely downwards and outwards from the tibia to the fibula. They are almost always divided into two distinct bundles. They are both re- markable from descending beyond the articular surfaces, so that they increase the depth of the cavity for the reception of the astragalus. The synovial mem- hraiie of this articulation is a prolongation from that of the ankle-joint. The interosseous ligament consists of fibrous bundles, mixed with adipose tissue, which unite the two triangular surfaces so firmly that the fibula is sometimes fractured in attempting to rupture the ligaments. 3. Interosseous Aponeurosis. ^ The name of interosseous ligament is given to an aponeurotic septum (JT, Jigs.t 79 and 80.), placed between the muscles of the anterior and those of the pos- terior aspect of the leg; it should rather be regarded as serving to multiply the points of insertion for fibres of those muscles, than as a means of union between the bones of the leg. It is narrower below than above, and is com- posed of fibres running obUquely downwards and outwards from the outer edge of the tibia to the longitudinal crest on the inner surface of the fibula. As in the interosseous ligament of the fore-arm, we find some other fibres crossing the former at an acute angle. The septum thus formed is interrupted above and below for the passage of the tibial vessels ; the peroneal artery and veins traverse the lower opening; the anterior tibial artery and veins pass through the upper. Mechanism of the Peroneo-tihial Articulations. The fibula is only capable of almost imperceptible gliding movements upon the tibia. This arrangement is directly connected with the mechanism of the ankle-joint. Ankle, or Tibio-tabsal Joint {figs. 79 and 80.). * Preparation. Cut and turn back the tendons that are reflected round the joint, and remove the sheaths of those tendons by which most of the ligaments are covered. The tibio-tarsal articulation belongs to the class of angular gmgbjmi. Articular surfaces. Both bones of the leg participate in this joint, their lower extremities being united to form a transversely oblong socket, of which the tibia constitutes by far the greater part. On this articular surface there is an antero-posterior ridge, corresponding to the groove of the trochlea on the astragalus, and separating two shallow cavities. The socket is bounded by the malleoli on each side. The internal or tibial malleolus corresponds to the internal lateral articular surface of the astragalus.; and the external or fibular malleolus, to the external lateral facette of the same bone. The superior articular surface of the astragalus is a trochlea; it is oblong from betore backwards, thus contrasting with the cavity on the lower extremity of the leg, which is transversely oblong. This trochlea presents a shallow depres^on, running from before backwards, and having an external and an internal edge, the external being the more elevated of the two. The puUey of the astragahis is conTnuous with its lateral articular surfaces, of which the external is by fai- %h7mear.s of union are three external lateral Ugaments, two internal lateral ligaments, an anterior (.r,fig. 80.) and a posterior {s,fiy. 79.) bgament, and a "^Th^externdhteral or peroneo-tarsal ligaments are three in number; they all nropeed from the fibula, either to the astragalus, or the os calcis. ^ i TieZeMeral ligament, properly so cafled (ligamentum fibula, me- , ,j 1, tv,of in nrrtpr to studv this as well as all the other articulations effi- cientW^t^irag^e^ataiut■ trb;'r^ovi& two Joints, of which one i, opened, whiUt the other has its ligaments untouched.ARTICULATIONS OF THE ANKLE JOINT. 315 P 4 dium vel perpendiculare, m. Jigs. 79 and 80.), is situated beneath the sheath of the peroneus longus and hrevis. It arises from the summit of the external maUeolus, is directed downwards and slightly backwards, to be attached to the outside of the os calcis. It is rounded and composed of parallel fibres. 2. The anterior externallateralligame7U(]iga.mentam&hu\w: a.nten\xs,n,Jig. 80.), arises from the anterior edge of the external malleolus, and proceeding downwards and forwards is fixed to the astragalus in front of its external mal- leolar facette. It is very short, and broader below than above: it forms one of the two anterior ligaments described by Bichat in this joint. 3. Thepostei-ior lateraUiga7nent(]igamentnmGbulgs posterius, o,Jig. 79.) is very deeply seated behind; it extends from the excavation on the inside and behind the external malleolus to the posterior border of the astragalus. It is directed abnost horizontally, or in a slight degree obliquely downwards and inwards, and is almost parallel to the posterior ligament of the lower peroneo-tibial ar- ticulation. It is composed of very distinct parallel fibres. Bichat calls it the posterior ligament of the joint. The internal lateral ligament is much stronger than the three external ligaments taken together. It is composed of two very distinct layers: 1. a superficial layer, consisting of fibres stretched from the apex and the an- terior and posterior borders of the internal maUeolus to the os calcis, and the upper edge of the lower calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, which it maintains in a state of constant tension. The fibres are long, and slightly divergent, but still sufficiently so to have given origin to its name of the deltoid ligament (p, figs. 79 and 80.). The fibres which are most anterior pass directly forwards to the neck of the astragalus and to the scaphoid; they form a very thin layer which has been improperly called the anterior ligament of the ankle-joint. 2. Below the above is a deep layer of much greater extent, composed of short and strong bundles, passing downwards and outwards from the summit and sides of the internal malleolus, to the inner surface of the astragalus, below the articular facette.* Synovial capsule. The external surface of this membrane is brought into view in front and behind, by removing the tendons and their sheaths ; and if the external and internal lateral ligaments be divided, it wiU be seen to extend into the inferior peroneo-tibial articulation. It will also be observed that it is tense at the sides, but very loose behind, and more particularly so in front. A great quantity of adipose tissue covers its external surface in these situa- tions. Mechanism of the Ankle-joint. This articulation not only constitutes the point at which the weight of the body IS transmitted to the foot, but also performs a very active part in the movements of progression; it is therefore so constructed as to unite great strength with the capability of tolerably extensive motion. With regard to strength, the foUowing arrangements should be noticed as especiaUy advantageous : L The leg being articulated with the foot at a right angle, transmits the weight of the body directly to it, and this transmission being effected in the perpendicular direction, i. e. in a direction in which the articular surfaces mutuaUy oppose each other, has no tendency either to pro- les in^^^' °J ^? ■''"'^ ligaments.

The dovetailing effected at this joint, by the reception of the astragalus into the socket, formed by the bones of the leg, is also highly conducive to its strength. This dovetailing results both from the pulley-like surface of the astragalus and from the angular form of the tibio-flbular socket; and it should be observed that this latter con- dition is, as it were, peculiar to the ankle joint, for in no othe» do we meet with such abrupt angles. With regard to mobility, the tibio-tarsal articulation admits of flexion and extension. There is no lateral motion, the movements of the foot in this di- rection being almost exclusively performed at the tarsal joints. In flexion, the astragalus glides backwards upon the tibia and fibula, and the back part of the pulley projects behind. Luxation, from an excess of this movement, is almost impossible, for it is limited by the meeting of the neck of the astragalus and the anterior edge of the tibio-fibular sockets. In this move- ment the posterior external lateral ligament, and the middle and posterior fibres of the internal lateral ligament, are put upon the stretch. In extension, on the contrary, the trochlea of the astragalus glides forwards upon the corresponding surface ; the synovial membrane is borne upwards in front; the anterior external lateral ligament, and the anterior and middle fibres of the internal lateral ligament, are stretched. Luxation is possible during this motion, but is very rare. Lateral movements. Although the shape of the joint is opposed to move- ments of this kind, yet it cannot be doubted that the elasticity of the fibula, by allowing the external maEeolus to yield a little, may permit them in a slight degree. Nevertheless the fibula must be fractured if any force, exerted by the astragalus against the external malleolus, be carried so.far as to thrust it much outwards. Articulations of the Taksus (Jigs. 80. 82, 83, 84.). The intrinsic articulations of the tarsus comprise, 1. the articulations of the component bones of each row ; 2. the articulation of the two rows together. Preparation. 1. Remove the tendons situated upon the dorsum of the foot, and also the extensor brevis digitorum muscle. 2. Remove all the muscles of the plantar region. 3. Rub oflF, by means of a rough cloth, the adipose tissue covering the ligaments: (a subject much infiltrated with serum is best adapted for this purpose). 4. In order to gain a clear comprehension of the articulation of the two rows together, remove the astragalus from the sort of box in which it is contained, by dividing the interosseous ligament which unites it to the os calcis 5 For the examination of the interosseous ligaments, it is necessary to separate the bones by laceration or section of those ligaments ; the resistance experienced in doing this, and the portions of the Ugaments remammg attached to the bones, will give a good idea of their strength and situation. 6. In order to obtain a correct notion of aU the Ugaments together, it is necessary, while studvine each, at the same time to examine a foot in which all the joints have been opened above, whilst the bones are stiU retained m their situations by means of the plantar ligaments.

The means of union, properly speaking, consist only of an extremely strong interosseous ligament (a, fig. 84.), formed by ligamentous bundles, of which some are vertical, and others oblique; they are mixed with fat, and occupy the considerable interval formed by the grooves of the two bones, and which is larger to- wards the outer end. To form a complete idea of this ligament, it is necessary to make a vertical sec- tion, from before backwards, through the middle of the astragalus and os calcis (as in fig. 84.). A loose synovial membrane lines the posterior articu- lation, which is strengthened on the inside by the fibrous sheaths of the tendons of the tibialis posticus, the flexor longus digitorum, and the flexor longus poUicis. There are also about this joint two very small fibrous bundles, one of which is posterior ( t, fig. 80.; a, fig. 83.), and the other external (6, fig. 83.) : some anatomists have described them by the names oi posterior and external ligaments. The anterior portion of this articulation is often double, from the division of the anterior articular surfaces into two smaller facettes: it forms part of the as- tragalo-scaphoid articulation, with which it will be described. Articulations of Hie Component Bones of the Second Row. All these joints are very compact, for the five bones which constitute this row act as one only in the movements performed by the foot at its tarsal articulations. They pre- sent for the most part angular facettes; they have F'R- 83. also interosseous ligaments, and are true symphyses or amphiarthroses. Articulations of the Cuneiform Bones with each other. Articular surfaces. The corresponding surfaces of the first and second cuneiform bones present contiguous as well as continuous portions. The contiguous portions are square, and situated at the upper and back part of each surface. The continuous portions are placed in front of the preceding. The corresponding articular surfaces of the second and third cuneiform bones are smooth and contiguous behind, but rough and irregular in front. Means of union. 1. By dorsal ligaments (c c, fig. 83.). This name is given to some very compact fibrous bands stretching transversely from one bone to the other. By their upper surfaces, on which the longest fibres may be seen, they are in relation with the extensor brevis digitorum and with the tendons of the other extensor muscles. Their lower sur- faces, the fibres of which are shorter, correspond to the articulations, and to the periosteum of the cuneiform bones, with which they interlace. 2. By plantar ligaments. This name may be given to some of the fibres of the interosseous ligaments. .'5. By interosseous ligaments. These, which are veryARTHROLOGY. 218 strong, constitute the principal means of union of these joints, and occupy all the rough portions of the corresponding facettes. They so closely unite the bones, that, even when the dorsal ligaments are removed, it is not easy to open the joints. The synovial membrane is merely a portion of the general synovial membrane of the tarsus. Articulations of the Scaphoid with the Cuneiform Bones. Articular mrfaces. The scaphoid presents the only example in the body, of a single articular surface being divided into three facettes by well-marked ridges. Each of these facettes is triangular, and corresponds to a surface of the same form on one of the cuneiform bones. The base of the triangular facette for the first cuneiform bone, is below : the bases of the other two are above (3, jig. 80.). Means of union. 1. Dorsal ligaments. There are two for the first cuneiform bone, a superior id,fig. 83.), and an internal ie,figs. 83 and 84.) ; and only one for each of the others (fffig. 83.). The dorsal ligaments of the first cuneiform bone pass directly backwards ; those of the other two are stretched obliquely forwards and outwards. 2. Plantar ligaments. A very strong plantar liga- ment (a. Jig. 82.) extends from the tubercle of the scaphoid to the correspond- ing tubercle of the fij-st cuneiform bone ; it is blended with the tendon of the tibialis posticus, which furnishes a considerable expansion that crosses the di- rection of the tendon of the peroneus longus, and extends to the third cunei- form and the corresponding metatarsal bone; it may be considered as an inferior ligament of the tarsus. The name of plantar ligaments can scarcely be given to some irregular fibres ib,Jig. 82.), passing from the lower surface of the scaphoid to the second and third cuneiform bones. A synovial membrane, common to the three articulations, is contmuous with that of the three cuneiform bones. Articulation of the Third Cuneiform Bone with the Cuboid. This articulation resembles in every respect those of the cuneiform bones. The means of union are a dorsal ligament {g,fig. 83.), consisting of a very strong transverse bundle; an interosseous ligament, which occupies the entirenon-arti- cular portion of the corresponding surfaces; and an lU-defined p/antor ligament, consisting of some irregular transverse fibres. The synovial membrane com- municates with that of the cuneo-scaphoid articulations. Articulation of the Scaphoid with the Cuboid. The scaphoid and the cuboid often unite by a smaU facette. The means of union are an oblique dorsal ligament {i,Jig. 83.); a very strong mterosseous hga- rn7occupying the whole of the corresponding surfaces of the bones, except- rnfihe smaU portions which are contiguous; and a very thick transverse ing the ,™ somewhat obliquely from the tuberosity of the i::^ZirC.:^t 'l^^^ ngaments eU^even when there are no arti- cular facettes.

I ARTICULATIONS OF THE TARSUS. 219 'S^VhilS of ..oepaon is co„p,e.ed by . which occupies the triangular interval between the small tuberosity of the os calcis and the sca- phoid, and forms by itself the inner side of the cavity of re- ception. In order to obtain a good view of this ligament, it is advisable to re- move the astragalus by cutting and tearing the interosseous ligament that unites it to the os calcis : it wiU then be seen, that the ligament we are describing is very strong and triangular, and that it covers not only the lower, but the inner part also of the head of the astragalus. It is often divided into two parts; one bemg external, narrow, and shaped like a band ; the other internal, much broader and thicker, in relation below with the sesamoid bone of the tendon of the tibialis posticus, and presenting a cartilaginous thickening at the correspond- ing point. Another ligament, caMei the superior cakaneo-scaphoid (I, Jig. 83.), must also be regarded as contributing to wedge in the astragalus ; it extends from the inside of the anterior extremity of the os calcis to the outside of the scaphoid. It is situated upon the dorsum of the foot, in the deep hollow occupied by fat, on the outer side of the astragalus. These two ligaments (the inferior and superior calcaneo-scaphoid) constitute the means of union between the os calcis and the scaph9id. These bones are in no part contiguous; but occa- sionally we find the os calcis continued into the scaphoid, through the medium of an osseous lamina, which replaces the lower calcaneo-scaphoid ligament.* The OS calcis being very securely articulated with the astragalus, and at the same time very firmly connected with the scaphoid, it follows that the articulation between the scaphoid and astragalus possesses great strength, al- though the ligaments directly uniting them are by no means powerful; just as the atlas, which is but slightly connected with the occipital bone by means of its own ligaments, is very firmly fixed by the ligaments stretching from the occipital bone to the axis. Nevertheless, the absence of any very strong and direct means of union between these bones, renders it possible for the astra- galus to be forced by external violence out of tt?^ sort of osseo-fibrous socket in which it is placed. The superior astragalo-scapJioid ligament (s, fig. 80. ; m, figs. 83 and 84.) is the only one proper to this joint; it is semicircular in form, and extends somewhat obliquely forwards and outwards, from the neck of the astragalus to the margin of the facette on the scaphoid. It is thin in texture, and con- sists of parallel fibres ; it is covered by the extensor brevis digitorum above, and is lined below by the synovial membrane of the articulation between the scaphoid and the astragalus. 2. Calcaneo-cuboid Articulation. This articulation is upon the same line as the astragalo-scaphoid ; an ana- tomical fact which has suggested the ingenious idea of a partial amputation of the foot between the two rows. It belongs to the class we have designated220 ARTHROLOGY. articulations by mutual reception, and of which we have found examples in the sterno-clavicular joint, and the carpo-metacarpal articulation of the thumb. Articular surfaces (2,fg. 80.). The facette of the os calcis is conca-ve from above downwards, while the surface of the cuboid is concave transversely, that is, in a direction at right angles to that of the former. At the lower part of the facette of the os calcis there is a horizontal projection, which some- times stops the knife during the disarticulation of the two rows. The means of union consist of three ligaments; an inferior or plantar, an internal and a superior. The inferior plantar, or calcaneo-cuboid ligament digamentum longum plantse, c d,figs. 82. and 84.), is the strongest of all the tarsal ligaments, forming a broad band of pearly white fibres, directed froni before backwards. These fibres constitute a very thick bundle, and extend from all the under sui-face of the os calcis, excepting the posterior tuberosities, to the posterior margin of the groove of the cuboid. If the fibres of this h- cament be removed layer by layer, we soon arrive at a more deeply seated Lament, separated from the first by some fatty tissue: it extends obliquely inwards from a tuberosity at the fore part of the under surface of the os calcis, to aU that portion of the inferior surface of the cuboid, situated behind its groove. There are, therefore, two inferior calcaneo-cuboid ligaments ; a deep fc"), and a superficial (d). . , , . The internal calcaneo-cuboid ligament (n,Jig. 83.) is short, narrow, quadri- lateral and very strong; it is placed at the side of the superior calcaneo- scaphJid ligament, in the deep excavation between the astragalus and the os calcis These two Ugaments are separated in front, but blended together be- hind,'so as to resemble the letter Y. They may be considered as m some measure forming the key of the articulation of the two rows of tarsal bones ; for during disarticulation the articular surfaces are easily separated as soon as '^Vel^ertfcalcaneo-cuboid ligament (p,fig. 83 ) is only a vc^tWu small band of fibres, extending directly forwards, from the os calcis to the cuboid.

But the astragalus is not placed horizontally above the os calcis, foi- it inclines inwards, downwards, and forwards; and from this circumstance, even in standing upon the soles of the feet, the weight of the body is distributed between the os calcis and the anterior range of the tarsus, which is itself subdivided into two rows, but only on the inside, because it is there chiefly that the weight of the body is transmitted by the astragalus. In one attitude, this weight is communicated by the astragalus exclnsively to the front row, viz. in standing upon the point of the foot; and it is then that the division of the tarsus into several bones is especially useful m preventing the injurious effects of shocks transmitted from below. There is an immense difference also, as regards their effects on the system, between falls upon the heels, and those upon the points of the feet. The mechanism of the tarsal articulations, with respect to mobility, should be first studied in the two ranges separately, and afterwards in the articulation of the two rows together. 1. The bones of the first range, viz. the astragalus and the os calcis, glide upon each other from before backwards and from side to side. The lateral glidings assist in the torsion of the foot, which, however, is cMefly performed at the articulation between the two rows. The antero-posterior glidings take place under the follo wing circumstances: when the weight of the body presses upon the upper part of the astragalus this bone slips a little forwards, and the foot has a tendency to become elongated, or flattened from above downwards, as Camper has remarked. When the pressure ceases,the astragalus returns to its original position. The truth of the assertion, that the foot is an elastic arch, is chiefly established by reference to the nature of the astragalo-calcanian joint. 2. The bones of the second row are capable of such very slight gliding movements, that they may be considered as forming but a single piece. How- ever, the articulation between the scaphoid and the cuneiform bones is somewhat more moveable than those of the cuneiform bones with each other and with the cuboid. 3. The chief movements of the tarsus take place between the two rows, and the articular surfaces are there very favourable to mobility; for there is in one part a head received into a cavity (at the astragalo-scaphoid articula- tion), and in another a mutual reception (at the calcaneo-cuboid articulation). These movements consist of a sort of torsion or rotation, by means of which the sole of the foot is carried either inwards or outwards. Assisted by slight lateral motions of the astragalo-calcanian joint, they constitute what is called adduction and abduction of the foot. They are generally attributed to the ankle-joint; but, as we have seen, that articulation is limited to flexion and ex- tension ; the sprains, therefore, which result from too extensive movements, either outwards or inwards, take place at the articulation of the two tarsal ranges, and not at the ankle-joint. When the movement of torsion is carried too far, the external malleolus is forced somewhat outwards; slight gliding mo- tions occur at the tibio-fibular articulations; the elasticity of the fibula is called into play; and, if the violence be immoderate, the fibula is fractured. Tarso-metatarsal Articulations (Jigs. 82 to 84.). In the formation of these joints the wedge-shaped tarsal extremity of each metatarsal bone is opposed to one of the bones of the tarsus, the corresponding th ^eing plane and triangular. The first metatarsal bone articulates with the farst cuneiform; the second metatarsal with the second, and slightly with the hrst and the third cuneiform bones; the third metatarsal with the third cuneitorm; the fourth and fifth metatarsal with the cuboid. From this there results an angular articular line, commencing on the outside at the projection tormed by the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal bone. This line is directed oDUquely forwards and inwards; it forms an angle at the third, and again222 ARTHROLOGY. more particularly at the second metatarsal bone, because the third cuneiform bone projects, and is wedged in between the second and fourth metatarsal bones, while the second metatarsal bone projects into the tarsus between the first and the third cuneiform bones. The articular surfaces are held together by dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments. We shall now study each of these articulations separately. Articulation of the first metatarsal bone with the tarsus. There are two semi- lunar facettes in this articulation, one belonging to the first metatarsal, the other to the first cuneiform bone; the long diameter of these surfaces is directed vertically. The strength of the joint is maintained by a very strong plantar if, figs. 82 and 84.), and a thinner dorsal {p,fig. 83. and e,fig. 84.) ligament. Both these consist of bands directed from before backwards. There is a dis- tinct synovial membrane for this joint. We may include among the ligaments of this articulation the aponeurotic expansion giren off by the peroneus longus to the first cuneiform bone, and also that derived from the tibialis anticus, and attached to the first metatarsal bone. The articulation of the second metatarsal bone with the tarsus is effected by the reception of the posterior extremity of that bone within the recess formed by the three cuneiform bones. We met with a similar arrangement, though less perfectly developed, in the carpo-metacarpal articulation of the second meta- carpal bone. It is the strongest of aU the joints of this kind, and is provided with, 1. three dorsal ligaments, as in the corresponding articulation in the hand; one median lr,fig. 83.), broad and constantly divided into two bands, which proceed from the second cuneiform bone; a very strong internal ligament, extending from the first cuneiform bone, the third being external, thm, and at- tached to the third cuneifoi-m bone; 2. with two plantar ligaments, one of which (a fiq 82 ) is very strong, extends obliquely from the first cuneiform to the second metatarsal bone, and is prolonged upwards so as to become mterosseous; the other is very small, and proceeds from the sharp edge of the second cunei- form to the second metatarsal bone ; 3. with an interosseous or lateral ligament, extending from the external lateral surface of the first cuneiform bone to the internal lateral surface of the second metatarsal bone. The articulation of the third metatarsal bone with the tarsus is maintained by a dorsal ligament (s, fig. 83.) from the third cuneiform bone Jh^ef i. no pk^ta^^ ligament, properly so called, unless an obhque bundle of fibres from the first cSorm bonebe^considered as such; but the ^^'^^^^^^y'Y^f.fZ'Z'i ing the sheath of the tendon of the peroneus longus, is P^-f^^ff^^^^to the third metatarsal bone, appears to me to act as a plantar ligament. There is also an T^^nal lateral or interosseous ligament, which separates the articulations of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. ThTfourth and fifth metatarsal bones together present a slightly concave surface which artif^ates with the convex surface of the cuboid.

Articulations of the tarsal extremities of tlie metatarsal bones. These are true amphiarthroses. The corresponding surfaces are partly contiguous and partly continuous. The contiguous part is nearer to the tarsus; it is flat, and presents on each bone two small secondary facettes. Contrary to -what obtains in the metacarpus, the continuous portions are larger than the articular surfaces. There are interosseous, dorsal, and plantar ligaments. The interosseous consist of very strong, short, and compact bundles of fibres, ■which extend between the rough surfaces of two neighbouring metatarsal bones. The dorsal (b,fig. 83.) and plantar (i,fig. 82.) pass transversely from one metatarsal bone to another, the plantar being much the larger. Articulations of the digital extremities of the metatarsal bones. Although the digital ends of these bones do not articulate together, yet, as they are in con- tact, and move upon each other, a synovial membrane covers the contiguous surfaces, and faciUtates their movements ; a ligament also, the transverse liga- ment of the metatarsus (x, figs. 82 and 83.), is stretched transversely in front, and unites them loosely together. This ligament is common to the five metatarsal bones ; it is formed by the junction of all the anterior ligaments of the meta- tarso-phalangal articulations by means of small bundles passing from one to another. It is exposed by opening the sheaths of the flexor tendons. Mechanism of the Metatarsal Articulations. With regard to strength. 1. The five component hones of the metatarsus are so strongly united that it is very uncommon for one of them to be broken by itself; the metatarsus, therefore, can be only fractured by violence sufficient to crush it. 2. The slight mobility of the bones also concurs in increasing the strength of this part of the foot, by permitting it to yield slightly to external impulse. 3. The metatarsus is not uniformly strong throughout; the first of its bones is the strongest, and upon it a great portion of the weight of the body rests during standing. The mobility possessed by the tarsal and the digital extremities of the meta- tarsal bones, requires to be separately noticed. 1. In the tarsal extremities, the angular arrangement, the mutual wedging of the tarsus and the metatarsus, as well as the strength and shortness of the external and interosseous ligaments, admit of only very obscure gliding move- ments ; a proof of which exists in the fact, that no example of the luxation of these bones upon the tarsus has, perhaps, ever been recorded. 2. Obscure, how- ever, as these movements may be, they give rise to considerable motions in the digital ends of the bones, where the mobility is favoui-ed by the looseness of the transverse metatarsal ligament, and the presence of a synovial mem- brane between the heads of the bones. The first metatarsal bone is not more moveable than the others; contrasting remarkably in this respect with the first metacarpal bone. Articulations or the Toes (,figs. 82 to 84.). Metatarso-phalangal Articulations. These articulations belong to the class condyloid, and offer a nearly perfect similarity to the metacarpo-phalangal joints. _ Articular surfaces.

It is grooved below for the flexor tendons, concave above to correspond with the convexity of the head of the metatarsal bone, and completes the cavity in which that head is received. Its anterior edge is very firmly fixed to the plantar border of the cavity of the phalanx, of which it seems a continuation ; its posterior edge is free, or rather is loosely connected by some ligamentous fibres to the ine- qualities behind the head of the metatarsal bone, upon the contracted neck of which it is moulded very exactly, so that, while protecting the lower part of the joint, it serves also to increase the extent of the surfaces included in the articulation. 2. There are two very strong lateral ligaments {ij,figs. 82 and 83.), an internal and an external, inserted not into the depressions on each side of the head of the metatarsal bone, but into tubercles situated behind them ; from this origin they proceed very obliquely forwards and downwards, like flat bands, spreading out as they advance, and terminating partly in the inferior ligament, and partly on the sides of the phalanx. There is no dorsal hgament, properly so called, but the corresponding extensor tendon evidently occupies its place. It is not uncommon to observe a prolongation from the anterior sur- face of this tendon united to the metatarsal end of the first phalanx. Synovial capsule. Under the extensor tendon we find a very loose synovial capsule; it covers the internal surface of the ligaments as well as the articular '^^'riieZetatarso-phalangal articulation of the first metatarsal bone presents some peculiarities which merit special description. 1. The articular surfaces are much larger than in the other sunilar joints. 2. The head of the first me- tatarsal bone presents two puUies on its plantar aspect, separated from each other by a prominent ridge directed from before backwards. This construction is connected with the presence of two sesamoid bones (g,Jig. 84.), developed in the substance of the inferior ligament, which is three or four tmies hicker than in the other joints. The lateral Ugaments are ahnost exclusively fixed into these sesamoid bones. This joint has also a sort of fibrous nng surmountmg the border of the glenoid cavity of the phalanx.

Mechanism of the Metatarso-phalangal Articulations. Like all condyloid joints, these admit of movements in four principal di- rections, and therefore are also capable of circumduction. Extension or flexion backwards can be carried much further than in any other similar joints. The lateral movements of abduction and adduction are very limited. Let us examine what takes place during each of these movements, in which the glenoid cavity of the first phalanx glides upon the head of the corre- sponding metatarsal bone. In flexion, the first phalanx glides downwards upon the head of the metatarsal bone ; the extensor tendon and the upper part of the synovial capsule, are stretched by the projecting head; the upper fibres of the lateral ligaments are also stretched; these fibres then limit the motion, which nevertheless may be carried so far that the phalanx may make a right angle with the metatarsal bones. In extension, the phalanx glides upwards upon the head of the corresponding metatarsal bone; the superior fibres of the lateral ligaments are relaxed, whilst the inferior are stretched : these latter and the inferior ligament evidently limit the motion." In all subjects it may be carried so far as to make an obtuse angle behind ; in some so as even to form a right angle. The movements of abduction and adduction are limited by the meeting of the toes. Mechanism of the Phalangal Articulations. As the mechanism of these joints is in every respect identical with that of the fingers, we shall refer to what has been said upon that subject, merely re- marking that, either from original construction, or from the continued confine- ment of the toes in tight shoes, their movements, which consist exclusively of flexion and extension, are much more limited than those of the fingers. Note on Arthrology. [It has been considered advisable to include in a single note the following observations on the general anatomy of the several tissues that enter into the construction of the articulations: — Cartilages (p. 148 ). The substance of the articular cartilages, in many joints, appears to be arranged ra masses placed side by side, and perpendicularly to the surface of the bone, and hence the fibrous character presented by them after slight maceration: nevertheless, they are com- posed of pure cartilage, unmixed with fibrous tissue. When viewed under the microscope cartilage is found to consist of a transparent substance, in which are imbedded numerous cor- puscles, either placed singly, or aggregated in groups. The intermediate substance is homo- geneous m youth, but becomes more or less laminated as age advances. The corpuscles which are, in fact, metamorphosed primitive cells, are of irregular forms, contain nuclei and nucleoli, and are somewhat flattened near the surface of the cartilage. Occasionally, several are seen occupying a distinct cavity in the intermediate substance. Their average size is •J-.th of an inch in length, by ^th in breadth.

Circumstances in which the teeth differ from bones. — Number. — Position. — External conformation. — General characters. — Classification — incisor — canine — molar. — Structure. — Development. The teeth, the immediate instruments of mastication, are those ossiform con- cretions, which surmount the edges and are implanted in the suhstance of both jaws. The teeth are not bones, though, from possessing an apparent analogy to them, they have long been considered as such. They differ from bones m many respects. 1. With regard to position. The teeth are naked and visible at the surface, ■whilst the bones, and this is one of their most important characters, are covered by periosteum. 2. In anatomical characters. The teeth consist of a bulb or thick papilla sur- rounded by a calcareous envelope, composed of two substances, the enamel and the ivory. This calcareous envelope is not traversed by vessels, nor can any trace of cellular tissue be discovered in it. 3. In regard to their mode of developement. In the teeth the formation of the hard or ossiform matter takes place by successive depositions, from the cii'- cumference to the centre; whilst bones are developed in a precisely opposite direction. No nutritive changes are carried on in the teeth as in bones. More- over the teeth are renewed by means of the second dentition; but there is no analogous phenomenon in the developement of bone. 4. In physiological relations. The teeth do not participate in the diseases of bone, being susceptible only of chemical and physical alterations ; nor is the period of their existence, like that of the bones, of equal duration with the life of the individual. 5. In regard to chemical composition. They contain a much larger proportion of saline matters, and the enamel is entirely destitute of gelatine. All these circumstances prove that the teeth are not bones. We shall now show that they belong to the epidermoid system, and are analogous to the nails and hair. 1. When examined in the lower animals, they are found to present an unin- terrupted series, from such as closely resemble horns or nails, to such as present the most perfectly characteristic appearances of bone. 2. They have a la- mellated structure, like the nails and hair: in some animals this is very mani- fest, but is rendered obscure in others from the abundance of calcareous de- posit. 3. They are developed in the same manner as horns, nails, and hair. 4. Like them, they present no nutritive phenomena; they are formed layer after layer, and undergo no renewal of their constituent parts; they are* inorganic bodies, the products of transudation. 5. According to M. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, the beak of birds, which is evidently a horny structure, belongs to the dental system. Number. In young subjects, at the period of the first dentition, there are twenty teeth, ten in each jaw : in the adult there are thirty-two, sixteen in each jaw. Man, therefore, during the course of his life has fifty-two teeth, twenty temporary, and thirty-two permanent. The varieties in the number of the teeth are either the result of a deficiency or au excess. The varieties/rom deficiency consist, 1. in the absence of aU teeth, examples ot which have been recorded by Fox and Sabatier; 2. in the absence of a great number of teeth, as occurred in an individual who had only the four incisors in each jaw. These deficiencies are chiefly observed to affect the posterior molares, and frequently they are merely apparent in them, from the teeth re- maming concealed within the alveoli for a much longer period than usuai * See note, p. 234.228 ODONTOLOGY. Besides, Fox remarks, that there is no tooth wliich has not occasionally been observed to be wanting, either alone or in conjunction with others. The varieties from excess are observed in the existence of supernumerary teeth, which may or may not range with the ordinary teeth. The supernumerary teeth either exist in distinct alveoli, or are blended with some other teeth. There are two varieties of this latter condition ; for the supernumerary tooth may either appear to grow upon a primitive or parent tooth {dens prolifer of Bartholin), or several teeth may seem as if united into one. Position. The teeth are arranged in two parabolic curves, constituting the dental arches, and corresponding to the alveolar arches which support them. Into these arches the teeth are fixed, not by articulation, but by the implanta- tion of their roots into the alveoli, which are moulded exactly upon them. This arrangement induced those anatomists who regarded the teeth as true bones, to admit a peculiar mode of articulation for them called gomphosis {y6fi(pos, a nail). The teeth are mechanically fixed in their alveoli; but yet we must consider the gums, and the alveolo-dental periosteum as also forming uniting media. The importance of the latter will be acknowledged, if we consider the effects of scurvy in loosening the teeth, and the ease with which they drop out from the skeleton. Each dental arch forms a regular uninterrupted curve, an arrangement pe- culiar to man, for in the lower animals the teeth are of unequal length, and the dental arches have irregular edges ; moreover, instead of their teeth being iminterruptedly contiguous, very considerable intervals, at some points at least, are left between them. Each dental arch presents an anterior convex, and a posterior concave surface; an adherent or alveolar border, which is regularly scalloped; and a free edge, thin and cutting at the middle, thick and tubercular at the sides; in the latter situations it has two lips, of which the external is sharper in the upper teeth, and the internal in the lower. The free edge is so arranged that all the teeth are upon a level. As the superior dental arch forms a greater curve than the inferior, it ne- cessarily follows that the two arches meet like the blades of a pair of scissors; but the mode in which they meet is not the same in the middle region, occu- pied by the incisor teeth, as on the sides where the molares are placed. Thus, the upper incisors pass in front of the lower, whilst the external tubercles of the superior molares pass to the outside of the external tubercles of the m- ferior molares, so that these latter tubercles are applied to the furrow formed between the two rows of tubercles of the upper molares. The teeth of the upper jaw, with the exception of the great molares, are larger in general than those of the lower. I should also remark that no tooth is placed quite perpendicularly to its fellow in the other jaw ; for the summit of a tooth in one jaw always corresponds to the interval between the summits of two in the other; so that the two rows of teeth are not simply in contact, but are really locked together. . „ . • ^ External conformation. The teeth, considered in reference to their form or configuration, present some general characters, which distinguish them from all other organs of the body; and also certain specific characters, by which one tooth may be distinguished from another. , . ^ General characters (figs. 85 to 92.^. Each tooth is composed of two very distinct parts ; a free portion, projecting beyond the alveolus, named the cro«;n or body (a, figs. 85, &c.), and a portion miplanted in the bone call^ed the root or fanq (6), the constricted portion between these two constituting the neck (c). The rim of the alveolus or socket does not exactly correspond to the neck of the tooth, but rather to the root, at some distance from the neck, the mter- ''^^'o^l^::^^lf^.'^^^<^ is p-"-r^ tTo species. The projection of the teeth forwards giv^s a disagreeable aspect o the countenance ; and is almost invariably connected with a diminution of the229 THE INCISOR TEETH. facial angle. The axis of all the teeth is slightly inclined, so as to converge somewhat towards the centre of the alveolar curve. The length of the teeth (that is, of their crowns) is very nearly uniform. The advantage of this arrangement in preventing one tooth from projecting beyond another, is very obvious. When the teeth are not equal in length, mastication is evidently imperfect; and therefore the principal object, in cases of fractui-e of the lower jaw, is to prevent the inconvenience that would arise from irre- gularity of the dental edge, and which is actually observed when the fragments unite in a wrong position. The teeth are only separated from each other by very small triangular intervals, so that they are almost contiguous. When the intervals are very considerable, mastication is imperfect. The general form of the teeth is that of a slightly elongated cone, flattened in opposite directions, the base of which is formed by the crown and turned towards the free edge of the dental arch, whUe the summit, formed by the simple or compound root, presents an opening that penetrates into the cavity of the tooth. The conical form of the root, and the accuracy with which the alveolus is moulded upon it, have a twofold result; viz. that the effort of mastication is disseminated over all points of the socket, and that no pressure is ever experienced at the extremity which receives the vessels and nerves. The differences presented by the teeth, more especially in the crown, have led to their arrangement into three classes ; viz. incisors, canine, and molars .- the latter have been subdivided into the great and small molars. The crown of the incisor teeth (figs. 85, 86.) resembles a wedge with the sharp border shaped like a chisel; as their name implies, they serve the pur- pose of cutting the food. The crown of a canine tooth {figs. 87, 88.) forms a cone with a free pointed apex; these teeth serve to tear the food, whence their name of laniaires: Hunter called them cuspidati, from their having only one point. The crown of a molar tooth (figs. 89 to 92.) is cuboidal, the free ex- tremity being provided with tubercles or points, intended to bruise the food as in a mill. The small molars, which have only two tubercles, are called by Hunter bicuspides (figs. 89 and 90.). Man alone, of the entire animal series, is possessed of the three kinds of teeth in an almost equal state of develope- ment. The Incisor Teeth (Jiffs. 85 and 86.). These are eight in number, four in either jaw. They occupy the middle of the dental arches, and consequently the anterior extremity of the lever of the third order, represented by each half of the jaw. Their position is unfavour- able, and consequently they are intended only to divide substances that offer but httle resistance. This class of teeth attain their utmost developement in rodentia; as in the rabbit, beaver, &c. General characters. The crown (a) is wedge-shaped; its anterior surface (fig. 85.) is convex, and the posterior concave; its sides ■ (fig- 86.) are triangular; its base is thick and continuous with the root, and its free edge sharp, somewhat broader than the base, and cut obliquely upwards and backwards in the upper teeth, and downwards and forwards in the lower. This ob- liquity of the surfaces by which the incisors of the two jaws correspond, is the result of their constant friction upon each other, for they cross like the blades of scissors. The cutting edge of an incisor tooth, before it is worn down, is marked by three small denticulations. The root (b) has the form of a cone flattened on the sides; the anterior border is thicker than ally exists on -r''""""- ^^'^'^^^^ ^^"'""'^ ^""^ fis- 86.), occasion- timps thp n^- f 'appearing to indicate an original division ; and some- tJnfis the pent of the root is bifid. Two curved lines, having their con- Q 3230 ODONTOLOGY. cavities directed downwards, and united on the sides of the tooth, separate the root from the crown.* . . , , ^ . Differential characters. The upper incisors are distinguished from the W by thiir much greater size, the former being almost twice as large as the latter. In the upper jaw, the middle are distinguished from the '«'^'-° their weU-maiked superiority in size. In the lower jaw, on the contrary, the lateral incisors are the larger, though the difference is but slight. The Canine Teeth {figs. 87, 88.). These are four in number ; two in each jaw. They are situated on either side externally to the incisors, and therefore are nearer to the fulcrum so that hey can OYercome a greater resistance. These teeth are most completely de- veloped in the carnivora. The tusks of the boar and of the elephant are also '"'"'^GmeraUharacters.

The molars are divided into two classes, according to their difference in size, and the number of tubercles upon their grinding surfaces.

The small molars of the upper jaw correspond to the canine foSSSB General characters. The crown (a) is irregularly cylindrical, flattened from before backwards, with its long diameter directed trans- versely. The anterior and posterior surfaces, which corre- spond to the two neighbouring teeth, are plain (see fig. 90.). The internal and external (fig. 89.) surfaces are convex; the free or grinding surface is armed with two tubercles or points separated from each other, by a furrow. Of the two tubercles the external is the larger. The crown of the small molars has been compared to that of two small canine teeth united. The root (b) is generally simple, but sometimes double or bifid. When simple, it has a deep vertical groove upon each side; when it is bifid, the separation is never so deep as in the great molars. Differential characters. The lower bicuspides are distinguished from the upper by their smaller size, by a slight projection of the crown inwards, and by the external tubercle being worn down. In the upper bicuspides the two tubercles are separated by a deep fuiTow ; in the lower, on the contrary, the furrow is more shallow, and the tubercles are sometimes united by a ridge. The second upper bicuspid has generally two roots (figs. 89 and 90.), by which it is distinguished from the others. The first lower bicuspid, somewhat smaller than the second, has most commonly but one tubercle, viz. the external. This gives it more resemblance to a canine tooth. The great molars or multicuspides (figs. 91 and 92.) are twelve in number; six in each jaw, three on one side, and three on the other. They are named numerically, proceeding from before backwards, first, second, and third. The last is also called dens sapientice, on account of its tardy appearance. They occupy the most remote part of the alveolar border. General characters. The crown (a) is pretty regu- larly cuboid. The anterior and posterior surfaces (see fig. 92.), by which these teeth correspond, are flat; the external and internal surfaces (fig. 91.) are rounded. The grinding surface is armed with four tubercles (dentes quadricuspides), separated by a crucial furrow, which is oc- casionally replaced by small depressions. In some teeth a fifth tubercle may be found. In almost all the tubercles are of unequal size, and cut into fa- cettes. The crown of the great molars resembles two small molars united. The root (b) is always compound ; it is most commonly double or triple, and, in this case, one of the roots has a longitudinal furrow. Sometimes it is divided into four or five parts, variable both in length and direction. The roots are either divergent or parallel; and occasionally, after separating, they approach each other again, curving like hooks, so as to embrace a more or less consi- derable portion of the jaw-bone. Such teeth (which are called dents bartees) it is impossible to extract, without pulling away the included portion of the jaw also. Each root of these teeth exactly resembles the single roots of the teeth already described, with the exception of being smaller.ODONTOLOGY. 232 » See note, p. 234. Differential characters of the upper compared with the lower molars. 1. Con- trary to -what was observed witli regard to the other teeth, the crowns of the lower great molars are a little larger than those the upper. 2. They are slightly bent inwards, while those of the upper great molars are quite vertical. 3. The iower great molars have only two roots, an anterior and a posterior. These roots are very strong and broad, flattened from before backwards, deeply grooved longitudinally, and bifurcated at the points. The upper great molars have, at least, three roots (^Jigs. 91 and 92.), one internal and two external. It •is very easy, then, to distinguish between the molar teeth of the two jaws. Individual characters of the great molars. 1. The first great molar is dis- tinguished from the other two by its size, in which it generally exceeds them. 2. The third great molar, or wisdom tooth, is distinguished from the first and second by its evidently smaller size ; by its crown having only three tubercles, two external and one internal; by its shortness ; and by its roots being, in certain cases, more or less completely joined together. However, even where the roots of these teeth are united, we always find the trace of the characters proper to the series of molar teeth to which they belong; i. e. the vestige of three roots, an internal and two external for the upper wisdom teeth, and of two roots, an anterior and a posterior for the lower No teeth present so many varieties as the last molares which, occasionally, even remain buried in the substance of the maxillary tuberosity. Fig. 93. Fig.9i- Structure of the Teeth. The crown of each tooth contains a cavity (d, figs. 93, 94.) corresponding with it in shape. This cavity is prolonged with con- tracted dimensions into the centre of the root, and opens by an orifice of variable size at the apex of the simple or compound cone, represented by the fang. The di- mensions of this cavity are in an inverse proportion to the age of the tooth; so that it is largest at the earbest .periods, but during the progress of years it becomes entirely obliterated. It contains a soft substance con- stituting the dental pulp. A tooth, therefore, is com- posed of two substances, an external hard or cortical portion, which is unorganised *, and an internal organ- — ised pulp. . ij 1, The dental pulp contained in the cavity of the tooth as m a mould, has the same form as the tooth to which it belongs. This pulp is connected with the dental vessels and nerves by means of a nervous and vascular pedicle, which after penetrating the dental cavity through the orifice in the apex of the root, and traversing the smaU canal, becomes continuous with it. i rom analogies, the accuracy of which will be seen in studying the developement of the teeth, the pulp may be regarded as a bulb or large papilla, and appears to consist ot a ne'rvous expansion traversed by a great number of vesse s. -^e-; derived from the internal maxiUary; the nerves belong to t^^ejnpenor and inferior maxiUary branches of the fifth pair. ^^''^^Zl^^^ln^^l^- demonstration on account of its tenuity, envelopes the pulp, which is ex T^^ slZ^e, is the seat of toothache, and it alone mi^^^^^^^^^^ all that has been said regarding the vitabty and sensibibty of the teeth.STRUCTURE OF THE TEETH, 233 * See note, p. 234. grinding surface of the tooth ; it diminishes in thickness as it approaches the neck, at which part it terminates abruptly. The prominence of the curved line, indicating the termination of the enamel, gives rise to the constriction Called tllG ll€ck. By comparing and in some degree contrasting the peculiar characters of the enamel and the ivory, we shall be better able to assign to each their respective properties. 1. The enamel is of a bluish-white, milky colour, and semi-transparent; the ivory is yellowish-white, and has an appearance like satin. 2. The enamel, examined in fragments of the crown, exhibits fibres perpen- dicularly implanted upon the ivory, and pressed closely to each other. The ivory, on the contrai-y, is formed of concentric layers* the fibres of which are generally parallel to the long diameter of the tooth. 3. Both substances are excessively hard; but in this respect the enamel is superior to the ivory, for it will strike fire with steel, and is much less easily worn down by use; it can even turn the edge of a file. This excessive hard- ness, a principal element of immutability, explains how the teeth are preserved uninjured as long as the enamel remains entire, and, on the other hand, the facility with which they decay when once it has been removed. The great brittleness of the enamel, which is one of its most characteristic properties, is also owing to this extreme hardness. 4. In chemical composition, the enamel and ivory present important differ- ences, indicated in the foUowiag tables : — Ivory. Enamel. i Phosphate of lime Fluate of lime ... Carbonate of lime - . - Phosphate of magnesia Soda and chloride of sodium Cartilage and water 61-95 2-10 5-30 1-25 1-40 28-00 Phosphate of lime ... Fluate of lime - - Carbonate of lime Phosphate of magnesia Membranes, soda and water S5 3 3-2 8-0 1- 5 2- 0 It follows, therefore, that the principal chemical distinction between these sub- stances depends on the existence of cartilage, that is, of an animal matter in the ivory, and on its absence in the enamel. The presence of cartUage in ivory forms a trace of resemblance between this substance and bone; and this is further strengthened by the result of the action of heat, by which both are similarly affected. Between the true bones and the ivory there is, however, all that dif- ference by which a living tissue is distinguished from a solidified product of se- cretion. I admit, then, a complete want of vitality both in the ivory and the enamel of the tooth ; nevertheless there are some phenomena which appear to contradict such an opinion. 1. The cortical substance of the tooth affords a much more perfect sensation of such bodies as come in contact with it, than either the nails or hair. 2. -Weak acids, particularly vegetable acids, cause a peculiar sensation, when they are applied to the teeth, rendering the slightest touch extremely painful; a sensation generally expressed by saying that the teeth are set on edge. But if, on the other hand, we reflect that the substance of the teeth is never affected by inflammation, that it never becomes the seat of any tumour or diseased product, and that it is worn away by rubbing and by the file, in the same way as an inorganic body, without any attempt at reparation or any evidence of the existence of a nutritive process, we must be led to admit the absence of vitality in these organs, and to explain the foregoing facts as dependent simply upon transmission. • ^'•ff*^^' liardness, fragility, and mutability of the enamel and ivory, vary in ditterent individuals ; hence the difference in the durability of the teeth and their liability to change. It must not be imagined, that the ivory when ex- posed IS susceptible of caries or necrosis; its changes are entirely of a che-234 THE TEETH. mical nature. The contrary opinion prevailed only so long as the teeth were considered true bones, and yet it has exercised an influence over the language of surgery which is not yet removed ; thus, we are in the habit of speaking of a carious or necrosed tooth, and to describe them as afiected with exostosis, and even with spina ventosa. It follows, from all that has been said, that the human teeth are simple, i. e. formed by one centre of ivory covered with one layer of enamel. Compound teeth exist only in herbivora, in which animals mastication consists of a most extensive grinding movement; nor are they met with except among the molar teeth. The characteristic feature of a compound tooth is the division of the crown into a greater or smaller number of lesser crowns, each of which con- sists of a centre of ivory covered by a layer of enamel. All these crowns are united into one by a third substance, called the cement or crusta petrosa, of which the tartar of the human teeth will afford a sufficiently good idea.* Fig. 95. * CRecent researches into the structure of the teeth have brought so many interesting facts to light, that it is necessary to notice the result of these discoveries. Tliree different structures at least enter into the formation of the human teeth, viz. the tvoty, tlie enamel, and the corlical substance. The ivory (a. Jig. 95.) consists of a hard transparent substance, traversed by numerous tubes, about jjsth of a line in diameter, which commence by open orifices at the cavity of the pulp, and extend in an undulating but nearly parallel direction towards the surface of the ivory. In this course the tubes present secondary and smaller undulations, un. dergo a dichotomous division, diminish in size, at first gradually, then ra- pidly, give off numerous lateral twigs, and, finally, divide into extremely minute ramifications, of which some anastomose together, others commu- nicate with small irregular dilatations called calcigerous cells, situated in the transparent intertubular substance, whilst the remainder appear to be lost at or near the surface of the ivory. The cells and tubes both contain calcareous matter, and seem to be analogous to the corpuscles of bone and the ramified lines radiating from them. In human teeth the cells are very minute ; but in those of many animals they are much more distinct, and present a striking an.ilogy to the osseous corpuscles. The hard intertubular substance is not homogeneous, but, as may be clearly seen in young and growing teeth, is composed of fibres arranged parallel to the tubes, wliicli appcir to have distinct parietes. It consists of animal tissue, combined with a large amount of calcareous salts; and it is the seat of bv far the greater proportion of the earthy matter contained in the ivory of the tooth. , , , The enamel (.b, fg. is composed of hexagonal and transversely striated fibres, about ,kth of a line in diameter, arranged parallel to each other and applied by their internal extremities to numerous corre- sponding depressions on the surface of the ivory, a delicate intervening membrane serving to connect the two structures. Near the neck of the tooth, the enamel fibres rest almost perpendicularly, near the apex of the crowi;,more or less obliquely upon the surface of the 'vory; moreover they are often slightly waved or curved. Previously to the eruption ot the tooth, each fibre contains an appreciable qu.intity of organic matter, which, at later periods, almost entirely disappears. The cortical substance (c, Jig.95.) consists of a thin of.seous layer deve- loped on the external surface of the fangs, and, as l^fe advances ex. tending even into their interior, and encroaching upon the cavity of the nuln It differs in no essential particular from true bone, containing the characteristic cor- miscies and anastomosing tubuli of that tissue.

The study of the developement of the teeth is one of the most interesting parts of their history.

Phenomena which precede their eruption* If the jaws of a foetus of t^o or three months be examined, it wiU be seen that they are marked by a broad * CThe earliest stase in the developement of the teeth, described in the text, is that in which theTntal'ulps are f ftuatedlt the bo'ttom of closed sacs , jt has long been fam.har to anatom sts and is now called the saccular stage. A condition antecedent to this n which 'nyuture sacs are as vet ooen follicles, was first described by Arnold, but we are indebted to Mr. Goodsir (Ed^i &S Surg. Journ. No. cxxxviii.) for the following connected history of the origin of the pulps and sacs ot the temporary and permanent teeth: — . „r , r„f„, ,h„,,t Origin oj the pulps and sacs of the temporary teeth. In the upper jaw of a foetus about the sixth week, between the lip and a semicircular lobe constitutmg the early condition of the palate, is situated a depression of the form of a horse-shoe. During the seventh week, this begins to be divided by a ridge (commencing from behind) into two grooves, of which the outer torms the recess between the lip and the future external alveolar process, whilst the inner constitutes the primitive dental groove. The mucous membrane along the floor of this groove is then thickened and from it a single papilla is developed, and subsequently four others arise from the external lip of the groove, in either half of the jaw. In the mean time, membranous lammffi projecting from the external lip, and at first only partially surrounding the papillae, unite with similar but smaller processes from the internal lip, so that each papilla (p, ■i,fig. 97.) becomes enclosed in a separate follicle (/, 3, ^g. 97.), communicating with the cavity of the mouth and lined by its mucous membrane. The papilla; now increase in size, and gradually assuming the form of the future temporary teeth, sink within the yet open follicles. At this period, the edges of the latter appear to be developed into opercula (o, i,fig. 97.), which difier in number and arrangement according to the shape of the crowns of the dlllerent teeth, there being two for the incisors, three for the canine, and four or five for the molars. The formation of the bony alveoli, by the developement of an external and internal alveolar process, and of inter-alveolar septa, closely follows the preceding changes in the soft parts. The order and lime of appearance of these ten papillas in the upper jaw are as follow: —first, those of the anterior temporary molars during the seventh week; of the canine teeth at the eighth ; of the central, and then of the lateral incisors about the ninth ; and in the tenth week those of l\\e posterior molars. The formation of the inter-foUicular septa, and the other changes in the papilla;, follicles, and alveolar borders, described above, proceed in the same order, and are completed about the thirteenth week. The condition of the upper jaw at that period, con- stituting the end of the follicular stage in the developement of the temporary teeth, is seen in 96., in which the follicles are shown as if held open; the diagrams 1 to 5 in fig. 97., re- presenting perpendicular sections across the jaw, may serve to illustrate the successive changes in the mucous membrane, from the commencement of the groove to the completion of the follicles. ccntic depression (c, 5, fig. ^7.) is formed immediately behind each of the follicles, the mouths of which are now closed by their opercula, but without adhesion ; the lips of the groove, which at this time is called the secondary dental groove, are now applied to each other (6, 97.). With the exception of the ten depressions just mentioned, and a small portion situated beyond the posterior temporary molar follicle, adhesion of every part of the groove now takes place, proceeding from before bnckw.irrts. The follicles are thus converted by the fifteenth week into shut sacs (s, l,fig. 97.), wlillst the enlarged papillae constitute the dental pulps (p, 7). The relation of the parts in this, the saccular, stage in the developement of the temporary teeth, is represented at 7, fig. 97. Independently of a few subordinate difl'erences, the ch.mges in the lower jaw are similar, and occur in the same order, each step in the process being somewhat later than the corresponding one in the upper. Origin of the pulps and sacs of the permanent teeth. It has been stated above, that, during the general adhesion of the dental groove occurring at the fifteenth week, the part posterior to the second temporary molar follicle (in either half of the jaw) still remains open ; in this situ- ation a pajjilla, sunk in an open follicle, appears during the sixteenth week. At the twentieth, the fundus of this follicle is converted into a sac, and the papilla into the pulp of the anterior permanent molar tooth, which is thus the earliest to appear of those of the second set, and is lurthor char.-ictcrised by being developed (like the papillae of the temporary teeth) from the nrimitive dental groove, and on the same level with tliem. At the end of this week tlie hitherto open portion of the groove is entirely closed by adhesion of its lips, but its walls still remain dis- Fig. 96.ODONTOLOGY. 236 and deep groove, divided by very thin septa into so many distinct sockets for the reception of the dental germs. The alveolar groove is closed at its free border by the membrane of the gum, which is stretched over a sort of thin, and, as it vrere, indented crest. This crest is formed by a tissue to -which some anatomists have given the name of dental cartilage ; it is a pale very strong fibrous tissue, and does not extend either upon the anterior or posterior sur- face of the bone, -which are only covered by the mucous membrane, the gum being as yet confined to the alveolar border. The gingival fibrous tissue sends united, and a cavity is thus formed, situate between the sac of the anterior permanent molar and the surface of the gum: this is the posterior cavity qf reserve, from which the pulps and sacs of the second and third molars are subsequently developed. The ten depressions (c, 6) formed behind the follicles of the temporary teeth during the se- a _ 4 2 Fig .97. 7 F,g. 98. condary condition of the dental groove (6,j!g.97.), in consequence of their escaping the Eeneral adhesio'n of its lips and sides, are converted into as many -v.ties,^called th^e«™ gate and recede into the substance of the gum. Pulps and folds (ana- logous to the opercula of the tem- porary follicles) are developed within them, appearing first in the anterior cavities; and they eventu- ally become the sacs of the ten an- terior permanent teeth, assuming a position behind and above those of the milk teeth in the upper, and behind and below them in the lower jaw (see 7 tol2,/^.97.; also/g. 98. and a. Jigs. 101, 102.), each oc- cupying corresponding recesses (d, fig. 102.) in the alveolar border. At this time, owing to the great relative ^l^.^^^^^^^^ tTel backwards and upwards into the maxillary tube- rosity of the upper, and into the coronoid process of the lower jaw (o 2); and the large postenor cavity of reserve (6 2) is drawn m the same direction. At birth, the length of the alveolar „. nu « border increases relatively, and this sac again ^'S- ^ - sinks to a level with those of the temporary teeth (a 3). The cavity of reserve (6 3), having now resumed its former position and shape, elongates backwards, and a pulp is developed in its fundus, which is converted before the fourth year into the sac of the second permanent molar. About the sixth or seventh year, the remaining part of the cavity once more elongates backwards, and forms the pulp and sac of the third permanent molar, or wisdom tooth. Each of these sacs undergo changes in their relative position in the jaws, similar to those experienced by the anterior per- manent molar, at first receding backwards and upwards, and then descending behind and on a level with the sac immediately anterior to it.237 DEVELOPEMENT OF THE TEETH. a prolongation into each alveolus {alveolo-dental periosteum), that forms a fibro- mucous sac upon each follicle, perforated at the bottom of the socket for the passage of the dental vessels and nerves. As these prolongations or sacs are intimately connected to the gingival membrane, by pulling gently upon the' latter we can raise the foUicles from their receptacles, and completely lay bare the alveoli. . . The: follicle or dental, germ consists essentially of a membrane, containmg a sort of pediculated papilla, known as the bulb or dental pulp. 1. The viembrane of the follicle, after having clothed the sac just described as lining the alveolus, is reflected upon the vessels and nerves which form the pedicle of the bulb, and appears to be prolonged upon the bulb itself: this, however, has not yet been demonstrated. The membrane of the follicle, there- fore, resembles the serous membranes in forming a shut sac, the inner surface of which is free and smooth, and the outer adherent. A transparent viscid fluid occupies the space between the bulb and the alveolar portion of the membrane. The following is the order in which the follicles of the first set of teeth appear. Towards the middle of the third month of foetal life there are four distinct folUcles in each jaw; at the end of the third month a third follicle appears in each half of the jaw, and a fourth and a fifth towards the end of the fourth month. 2. Of the dental bulb. In the earliest stages the membrane of the dental foUicle only contains a fluid, which is at first reddish, and afterwards yellowish white ; but towards the third month a small body makes its appearance, rising as a papilla from the bottom of the alveolus.* This papilla is abundantly sup- plied with vessels and nerves, and progressively increases in firmness and in size. A very thin pedicle, consisting of the dental vessels and nerves, affords attachment to it, so that it is suspended like a grape. This papilla, dental bulb, or pulp, gradually acquires the characteristic form of some particular tooth, of which it presents an exact model, constituting the nucleus around which the tooth itself is deposited. The first part developed upon this papilla is the crown of the tooth, on which we already find indications of the va.rious eminences and depressions su'bsequently exhibited by it. The developement of the hard portion commences towards the middle of pregnancy. The production of the ossiform matter upon the surface of the bulb is effected by a process of secretion f : it begins by the deposition of some small laminae, or very delicate scales (1, fig. 99.) upon each projection of the pulp: they are at first pliable and elastic, but gradually become more consistent. These laminae or scjQes constitute so many formative points for the tooth, and From the preceding observations it follows, that the pulps and sacs of both the temporary and permanent teeth have a common origin from the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane ; that a papilla is first formed, afterwards surrounded by and sunk into a follicle, which latter is then converted into a closed sac ; and hence the origin of the terms, papillary, follicular, and sac- cular, applied to these several conditions. It moreover appears, that all the temporary teeth, and also the anterior permanent molar, originate from the primitive denial groove ; and that all the permanent teeth, except the anterior molar, are developed from cavities of reserve commenced during its secondary condition. For an account of the changes occurring in the pulps and sacs of the two sets of teeth, during tha saccular and eruptive stages, the reader may now referto the text; remembering, however, that the term follicle is there applied to the entire dental germ in its saccular condition, con- « T? °'^ '^'oss'i sac and its contained pulp.] [The papilla of a temporary tooth appears even before the formation of the open follicle, and + rn-u''''- prior to its conversion into a shut sac.

The incisor and canine teeth have only one scale; the bicuspides have two; and the great molares as many as there are tubercles. These small scales so intimately embrace the pulp upon which they are moulded, that it requires some force to detach them ; and yet their inner surface, as well as the outer, is very smooth. It should be remarked, that the pulp has a much more vividly red colour at the points covered by the scales. The scales are visible in the lower jaw at an earlier period than in the upper. The following is the order in which they appear : —The middle incisors are visible from the fourth to the fifth month ; they are soon followed, 1. by the lateral incisors ; 2. by the first or anterior molar, which appears from the fifth to the sixth month ; 3. at a short interval from each other, by the canine and the second molar; the scales of all the teeth of the first set have made their appearance by the seventh month, according to the observations of Meckel; but at the eighth month, according to Blake. As de velopement advances the scales enlarge, and gradually uniting {2, fig. 99.) form a sheath or shell of ivory, which, during its growth, incloses the pulp, and, by degrees, extends to the vascular and nervous pedicle at the part where it pe- netrates the alveolus.* The outermost sheath being formed, a second is deposited within it, then a third within that, and so on. The external surface of the bulb secretes the ivory. The enamel is formed from the parietal or alveolar layer of the follicular membrane : at the commencement of its formation it is so soft that, in a foetus at the full time, it can be very easUy separated from the ivory. It has been asserted by some that the enamel, as well as the ivory, is the product of a secretion from the bulb, from which it has transuded in a liqmd state through the different layers of the ivory, and has then solidified upon its sur- face ; others affirm that the enamel is a sort of crystaUine deposit from the fluid surrounding the tooth ; but the greater number of anatomists admit, with Hunter, that the enamel is a product of secretion from the parietal layer f, as the ivory is from the layer of the follicular membrane, reflected upon the bulb. This opinion appears to me the more probable, because, on examining with at- tention the parietal layer, we find on its inner surface, near the crown ot the tooth, a sort of pulp, or very evident enlargement, particularly in the follicles of the molar teeth. This external pulp becomes atrophied as soon as the but to the fibres of the inter-tubular substance in a growing tooth.

JDEVELOPEMENT OF THE TEETH. 239 enamel is formed; and hence the fang is not covered with enamel, although, after the eruption of the tooth, that part occupies the former position of the crown. This external pulp does not exist m some of the dental foUicles of certain animals, and we cannot, therefore, be astonished that such teeth have no enamel. Lastly, when this external pulp remams after the eruption ot the teeth, the secretion of the enamel also continues, like that of the ivory. Ihis is the case with the incisors of the rabbit and the beaver. In these animals the enamel occupies only the anterior surface of the tooth ; consequently the edge always remains sharp, from the unequal wearing of the anterior and posterior surfaces. ■. • e v. From what has been said concerning the phenomena ot the formation ot the provisionary teeth before their eruption, we may draw the following conclu- sions : 1. Of the two constituent parts of a tooth, viz. the cortical or hard por- tion, and the medullary portion or pulp, the latter is first developed; and of the two distinct elements of the hard portion, viz. the ivory and the enamel, the formation of the ivory is first commenced. 2. The deposition of the cortical substance of the tooth begins at the crown ; the roots are not formed until a subsequent period. 3. The bulb being inclosed within the solidified products which it has furnished, diminishes gradually in size as these press upon it. Phenomena which accompany the eruption of the first or temporary teeth. At the time of birth all the teeth are still contained within their alveoli. Ex- ceptions to this rule have been met with in cases where infants have been born with one or two teeth. If the anterior wall of the alveoli be removed at this time, the teeth will already be found considerably, biit unequally de- veloped, none having yet reached the bottom of the socket. But after birth, and at periods to be presently indicated, the extremity of the root having reached the bottom of the alveolus, and the farther growth of the tooth in that direc- tion being impossible, it is efiected in the direction of the gum, -which is com- pressed, becomes inflamed, and is perforated; this perforation, however, is not exclusively the result of distension, for the gum is but very slightly stretched when it opens; and in other cases where it is greatly distended, as by polypi or other tumours, it is not lacerated at all. The tooth gradually rises, and the gum moulds itself successively upon the difierent portions of the crown, and, lastly, upon the neck of the tooth. The division of the gum is a severe process, but still it cannot altogether explain those serious symptoms which frequently accompany the first dentition. The eruption of the teeth does not take place simultaneously, but in suc- cession, and in a regular order that admits of but few exceptions. 1. The teeth of the same kind appear in pairs, one on the right side, the other on the left: 2. the teeth of the lower jaw precede those of the upper in their appear- ance *: 3. the middle incisors are cut before the lateral, these before the first molars ; after these come the canine; and then the second molars. The erup- tion of the first set of teeth commences towards the sixth month after birth, and terminates at the end of the third or the commencement of the fourth year. The middle lower incisors appear from the fourth to the tenth month, and soon afterwards the upper middle incisors; the inferior lateral incisors appear from the eighth to the sixteenth month; and then the superior lateral incisors. The first lower molars are cut from the fifteenth to the twenty-fourth month ; the lower canine from the twentieth to the thirtieth; and the upper first mo- lars and canine soon afterwards. In some cases the eruption of the canine and the first molar teeth takes place simultaneously; sometimes even the canine teeth take the precedence. The second great molars appear from the twenty-eighth to the fortieth month, and thus complete the twenty teeth of the * [Although the papillse, it will be remembered, appe.ir earlier in the upper jaw.]ODONTOLOGY. 240 » Sec note, p. 235. Second or Permanent Teeth. Phenomena which precede the eruption* The second dentition consists of the eruption of the teeth called permanent, to distinguish them from the temporary teeth. They are thirty-two in number, so that there are twelve additional teeth in the second set. In this dentition, as in the former, we have to study the phenomena which precede, accompany, and follow the eruption of the teeth. The follicles or germs of the second set of teeth correspond to the row of teeth already formed, bony septa intervening between them. They have the following relations with the follicles of the provisionary teeth. 1. The follicles of the additional teeth in the second set, viz. the three last molars, are situated in the same curve as the milk teeth, but they occupy of necessity the lateral extremities of these curves (Jig.lOQ.'). 2. The follicles of those teeth of the second set that replace others of the first, are, on the contrary, situated precisely behind the teeth to which they correspond (a, figs. 100, 101, 102.). These follicles are at first contained in the same alveoli as the temporary 7 r^. i, teeth; but after a cer- >> Ftg. 100. M 2. • J ± tarn tune septa are gra- dually formed between them, proceeding from the bottom of each al- veolus towards its ori- fice (figs. 101, 102.). Nevertheless, for a long time after the forma- tion of these septa, the temporary (a a\ fig. 102.) and the permanent C6'6) alveoli communicate by tolerably large ori- fices (c' c'yfigs. 101,102.), through which proceed the cords {c,fig. 102.) connect- ing the two teeth. The follicles of the permanent teeth do not sensibly differ in their mode of developement from those of the provisionary teeth, only the increase of the vascular system of the former coincides with the progressive atrophy of the vessels of the latter. Phenomena which accompany their eruption. As long as the developement of the permanent teeth can be effected in a direction towards the bottom of their sockets, the temporary teeth remain uninjured; but when the growth of the permanent teeth influences their upper edges, the alveoli of the first set are compressed, and afterwards destroyed at the parts corresponding to the crowns of the permanent teeth (see ^^.101.). After this time the alveoli of the first and second sets form common cavities: the roots of the milk teeth being com- pressed by the crown of the permanent teeth, un- dergo a loss of substance, become loosened, and may be detached by the slightest effort, each tooth being retained in its place only by the sort of ring formed by the gum around its neck. The shedding of the milk teeth is not always effected in the way we have described, viz. by a previous destruction of their root. Sometimes, in fact the permanent tooth does not penetrate into the alveolus of the corresponding milk tooth; but this alveolus is gradually waited «wfv hv the constantly increasing developement of the neighbouring per- LanL?Utt case, the milk teeth may fall without destruction of J?!?, rnn?rwbich howcvcr, are then almost always slender, and, as it were, aSrTpWed Sme 'cSmpSon, either exercised upon the pai-ietes of the tern- Dorarv sockets, or upon the roots of the milk teeth, is almost indispensab e for Their exp^sion. When, in fact, the permanent tooth deviates from its Fig. 101.241 DEVELOPEMENT OF THE TEETH. natural direction, and consequently does not press upon the milk tooth, this latter remains, and forms a supernumerary tooth. We cannot, then, doubt the influence of this compression upon the fall of the milk teeth; but anatomists are not agreed as to the immediate cause of the destruction of the temporaiy alveoli, and of the roots of the teeth contained within them. How does this compression act? Does it produce the fall of the milk teeth in a purely me- chanical manner, or does it effect this indirectly by the destruction of the dental vessels and nerves? One author believes the latter to be the principal cause; but what we have already said regarding the want of vitality in the teeth, will abundantly prove that the wearing away of the alveolus and the milk tooth is the result of mechanical pressure. At the same time it should be observed, that, since the destruction of the roots of the milk teeth leaves no debris, a process of absorption must therefore be performed, the exciting cause of which is undoubtedly the compression above alluded to. It is not necessary, as some authors have believed, to assume the existence of a peculiar absorbent apparatus, appropriated to this office. The teeth of the first dentition are shed in the space comprised between the sixth and the eighth year, the fall of each tooth taking place in the same order as its appearance. Blake was the first to point out the existence of a cord (Cyfig. 102.) passing from tlie follicle of the perma- nent tooth, along a small long canal (c' c'), behind the alveolus of the milk tooth, and becoming con- tinuous with th-e gum. It has been supposed that the canal, and the cord placed within it, were intended to direct the tooth during the progress of its eruption. Hence the name of iter dentis given to the canal, and gubernaculuni dentis applied to the cord, which Has been ingeniously compared by M. Serres to the gubernaculum testis. This cord appears to me to be solid *, not hollow; it is very well marked in the incisor teeth, but forms a mere thread in the molars. Upon the whole, the in- fluence exerted by the iter dentis and gubernaculum upon the direction of the permanent teeth during its eruption, is by no means constant. Order of eruption. The first permanent teeth which appear are the firsi great molars; they precede the other permanent teeth by a considerable interval, and immediately succeed the milk teeth, co-existing with them tor some time ; they have been, therefore, unproperly classed among the fii-st set of teeth in some anatomical treatises. The first great molars are known by the vulgar name of seven years' teeth. The eruption of the permanent teeth takes place in the same order as that of the milk teeth. Below are stated the periods at which each pair are protruded: — Fig. 102 Middle lower incisors Middle upper incisors Lateral incisors First small molar Canine teeth Second small molar Second great molar Third great molar from 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 28 to 8 years. 9 — — 10 — 11 — 12 — 13 — 14 — 30 A rising from the adhesion of the sides of the elongated part of the cnvity of rescrro.]£42 ODONTOLOGY. The greatest irregularity exists in the eruption of this last molar tooth, -which is often wanting, and frequently remains, durmg the whole of hfe, either partiaUy or entirely inclosed within the substance of the jaw. The incisor and canine teeth of the second set are much larger than the corresponding milk teeth. The opposite is the case with regard to the first two permanent molars, viz. the small molars, or bicuspides. It was ascer- tained by the inquiries of Hunter that, in this way, there is such a compen- sation, that the t-^enty teeth of the first set occupy precisely the same space as he twenty corresponding teeth of the second. This is not a purely specu- lative question, but one of singular interest in relation to the practice of ex- tSnff the milk teeth. The truth of Hnnter's assertion may be confirmed by measuring with a thread the space occupied by the twenty temporary teeth, Tnd cwring it with the space occupied by the corresponding teeth of he second set. M. Delabarre has done this upon the same mdividual at the '''''^JlV^Lt^^^'ike eruption of the permanent teeth. These relate, 1 to their growth; 2. to their decadence. ^ SJh of the teeth.

Of this nature are the incrustations with tartar, the product of a vitiated secretion, attributed by several anatomists, and especially by M. Serres, to some small foUicles, the function ot which, before the eruption of the teeth, is to produce a fluid to soften the gum preparatory to its perforation by the teeth. Again exostosis and spina ventosa of the teeth evidently depend upon irregular secretion of the enamel and ivory. The consolidation of fractures of the teeth is explained by the formation of new layers resembling those which have been seen surrounding buUets in the substance of an elephant's tusk Lastly, the colouration of the teeth, from the action of madder, is only observed in the layers deposited during its use, and therefore does not prove the existence of any nutritive process in these organs, such as takes place in bone. With regard to the evolution of the teeth in two distinct sets, it may be in- quired what is the object of such an arrangement. Without entering here into the discussion of final causes, it cannot be denied that the second set of teeth would not accord with the comparatively small size of the jaws in the foetus. Use. 1. The teeth are the immediate agents of mastication. The incisors cut, the canine tear, and the molars grind the food; the position of each being regulated by the resistance they have to overcome. 2. The teeth form a kind of elevated border, which prevents the constant escape of saliva from the mouth. 3. They assist in rendering sounds articulate, by affording a fixed point to the tongue in the pronunciation of certain consonants, called by gram- marians dental. 4, The teeth furnish important characters for zoological clas- sifications. Indeed, as they bear a necessary relation to the mode of feeding in different animals, a circumstance that exercises so great an influence over their entire organisation, it may easUy be conceived, that the form of the teeth is, to a certain extent, one of the characters by which a summary idea is conveyed of the nature of that organisation. At the same time, it is necessary to guard against the evidently erroneous conclusions, which some philosophers have de- lighted in deducing from the arrangement of the dental apparatus in man, with regard to his fitness for a purely animal, or exclusively vegetable diet. Above all it should be remembered, that the mechanical ingenuity of mankind must always form an indispensable element in the solution of every problem of this nature. * [It IS necessary in some degree to modify this definition of tlie hard portion of the teeth which, though extra-vascular, and, on that account, probably subject neither to interstitial ab- sorption nor nutrition, cannot be regarded with propriety as unorganised or crystalline bodies.] R2244 MYOLOGY. The muscles in general. — Nomenclature. — Number. — Volume and substance.— Figure. Dissection. — Relations. — Attachments. — Structure. — Uses. — Preparation. — Order of description. The active organs of locomotion are called muscles.* They are composed of bundles of red or reddish fibres, consisting of fibrin as their basis, and pos- sessing the essential property of contractility, that is, the power of contracting or shortening upon the application of a stimulus, t Nomenclature of Muscles. The names applied to the various muscles have not been founded upon uni- form principle. Before the time of Sylvius the muscles of any region (of the thiffh for example) were designated numerically, first, second, &c. in the order of their super-position or of their uses. Sylvius first gave particular names to the greater number of the muscles ; and he was followed by almost aU succeeding anatomists, especially by Riolanus. In this nomenclature, which is still generally adopted, the names of the muscles are derived, 1. from their s tuation, as radialis, ulnaris, peroneus, &c.; 2. from their size as gluta^us maSmus minimus; palmaris longus, brevis, &c.; 3. from their direction, as "abdominis, obliqm capitis f 4. from their shape which is generally an Serfect representation, either of certain geometric figures, as rhomboideus. S^ramidalis and scalenus, or of well known objects, as deltoideus, lumbrici, Eoleu (from solea, the sole fish) ; 5. from their divisions or compbcation , as diSricus (from having two bellies), triceps (from having three heads), bLfps complexus, &c.; 6. from their insertions, as sterno-hyoid, stemo- thvroid &c ■ 7. from their uses, as flexors, abductors, &c. ^In modern times many attempts have been made to substitute m the place of the^e va?«eTnd generally arbitrary denominations, an uniform nomencla- this circumstance alone, preferable to any new appeUations.

Volume and Substance of'the Muscular System. Of all the systems of organs in the body the muscular is predominant both in substance and in volume. This great mass of muscular apparatus is a ne- cessary consequence of the unfavourable position of most of the levers repre- sented by the bones. There is very great variety in different individuals, as regards both the volume and substance of the muscular system. Compare in this respect the glutseus maximus of a robust man, and the same muscle in a thin nervous individual, much emaciated, but yet in perfect health, for still greater differences are produced by disease : size and strength of the mus- cular system may also be natural or acquired, partial or general. Partial pre- ponderance is most usually acquired, and is commonly the result of exercise. To be convinced of this, it is only necessary to inspect the muscles of certain regions, in individuals whose employment requires the special exercise of those parts. The preponderance of the muscles on the right side is produced solely by the habit of using this side more than the other; it is not, as has been al- leged, the result of congenital difference. Lastly, the size of one or the other region of the muscular system, in dif- ferent animals, is in relation either with their instinctive propensities, their mode of feeding, or their natural attitude, or with some other important pecu- liarity in their organisation. Hence we find, 1. in the lion, the tiger, and other carnivorous animals that tear their prey in pieces, the muscles connected with the inferior maxilla, the most highly developed; 2. in the bear, which is a climbing animal, the muscles of the back; 3. in the hare, whose mode of progression is by successive leaps, the muscles of the hind limbs ; 4. the muscles of the wing in birds; and 5. those of the lower extremities and the vertebral grooves in man, to whom the erect position is peculiar. Figure of the Muscles. The figure of the muscles is determined upon the following data :— 1. From a comparison of them with geometric figures or with familiar objects. 2. From the respective arrangement of their surfaces, edges, and angles; 3. from their being symmetrical or otherwise. In this latter resj)ect there is a remark- able difi'erence between the osseous and the muscular systems: many bones are symmetrical, or azygos, whilst ahnost aU the muscles, on the contrary, are asymmetrical and arranged in pairs. 4. From the relative proportion between their three dimensions ; from this latter consideration, muscles have been di- vided into three classes, viz. long, broad, and short, concerning each of whicb we shall make some general remarks. The long muscles are chiefly met with in the Hmbs. Their length is some- times considerable ; and the longest are always most superficial. Very lone muscles generally pass over several articulations, and can therefore assist in moving them all. This great length of certain muscles has also another ad- vantage, VIZ. that It enables them to obtain a fixed point of attachment upon a less movable part, as the trunk, from which they can then act upon the more moDiie parts : such is the case with the muscles that move the thigh or the leg J^ong muscles are either simple or divided. Sometimes the division occurs at me more movable attachment; sometimes at that which is habitually fixed "^^'^P^ parietes of cavities; they are quadrilateral, tZv .tf ^I attachment are on the trunk ; and triangular, when they extend from the trunk to the extremities.

This is partictdarly ■well shiwn in the broad muscles of the abdomen. The short muscks are generally met with in the same situations as the short bones. It is not the shortness of its fibres, but of its fleshy body that charac- terises a short muscle. It is important to notice, with regard to these muscles, that a number of them are often arranged in succession so as to resemble a, long muscle. Of this we shall find many examples in the muscles of the ver- tebral grooves. Direction of the Muscles. The direction, of the muscles is one of the most important points in their history, since, without a knowledge of this, it is impossible to appreciate their xises. 'Each muscle has an axis or middle line, in which the general action of its fibres takes effect. Few muscles are altogether rectilinear; most are an- gular or curved; and almost all undergo certain deviations or reflections, in passing round the joints: some indeed take a direction, at right angles to their primitive course, when they pass over pulleys or hook-like processes. In muscles of this kind the action is in the direction of the reflected portion. The direction of muscles must be studied with reference to the axis of the body, but especially to the axis of the limb or lever, in relation to which they represent the moving power. Many muscles are almost parallel to the axis of the lever upon which they act; but it should also be remarked, that in certam positions these same muscles form greater or smaller angles with their corre- sponding levers, and may even become perpendicular to them. In this respect the direction of the muscles is not absolute, but is subordinate to the position of the levers. . , , , ,. , .■■ Some muscles are constantly perpendicular to the levers upon which they The angles of incidence of the muscles upon their points of attachments are very variable, but generaUy they are more nearly paraUel than perpendicular lo those point^. As the aiis of a muscle is not the same as that of com- ponent fibres, it is necessary to study, in each muscle, not only the direction of the fleshy belly but that of the fibres also. Relations or Connections of the Muscles. In reference to surgery, the relations or connections of the muscles are amone the most important circumstances in their history. Sttions oj the luscles to the skin.

The muscles are ™f d ;P°° other in successive layers; each muscle is covered by a sort of fi^ro-cellukr sheath ; and a loose and moist cellular tissue is interposed .between the M- ferent sheaths, so as to facilitate the gliding movement and independent con- traction of each muscle. This isolation of the muscles does not exist through- out their entire length ; several are often blended together in one common in- sertion, from which they proceed as from a centre, afterwards separating fiom each other. This community of attachment is prmcipaUy observed in those muscles that perform analogous ofaces, or that, usuaOy at least, act simul- taneously. Most muscles are inclosed in a separate fibrous sheath, which iso- lates them in their actions and also in their diseases. Of this, we shall fmd remarkable examples in the rectus abdominis and sartorms. With regard to the relations of their edges, the muscles are sometimes contiguous throughout their entire course, and sometimes separated by intervals, generally ot a tri- angular figui-e; and principally imponant in surgical anatomy, because incisions, for the exposure of vessels, are almost always made in such intervals. Relations of muscles to the vessels and nerves. The muscles serve to protect the vessels and nerves, not only in consequence of the thickness of the layers which they form in front of them, but also by the resistance they oppose during their contraction to external violence. Near the centre of a limb there isgeneraUy a considerable cellular interval between the muscular layers, which is intended for the principal vessels and nerves. The existence of such spaces prevents the injury which these vital parts would sustain from compression during the contraction of the muscles. It is also worthy of notice, that when- ever a vessel passes through the body of a muscle we find an aponeurotic arch or ring, which is non-contractile, and in some degree, therefore, obviates the danger of compression during the action of the muscular fibres. I say in some degree ; because in order to render compression of the vessels impossible, the muscular fibres, attached to these rings, must have proceeded from them as from a centre, diverging in all directions. In this case the action of the muscles would not change the form of the rings, but would tend to increase their diameters in every direction. It is found, however, that they are invari- ably elongated in one direction and diminished in another, when the fibres of the muscle contract. BernouiUi, indeed, has shown that it is impossible to change the form of a circle, by making one of its diameters greater than the others, without, at the same time, diminishing its capacity ; because, within a given periphery, the most regular figures have the greatest capacity, and the circle is more regular than either the oval or the ellipse. On the whole, however, it must be understood, that the contraction of the fibrous rings does not, in any material degree, impede the circulation. It should also be remarked, that a distinct fibrous sheath surrounds the ves- sels and the nerves, serving to isolate and protect them amid the various muscles by which they are surrounded. Most of the arteries have accompanying muscles, which may be called their respective satellites : thus, the sartorius is the satellite muscle of the femoral artery, the biceps of the brachial, the stemo-mastoid of the carotid, &c. Attachments or Insertions of Muscles. The attachments or insertions of muscles constitute one of the most impor- tant points in their history, and one which requires to be studied with the greatest care, because the uses of a muscle can be determined from a know- ledge of its insertions alone. The?e insertions should be considered in two points of view: 1. as to the direct insertion of the muscular fibres into the tendons, aponeuroses, or other structures; 2. as to the insertion of the tendons and aponeuroses into the levers represented by the osseous system. R 4248 MYOLOGY. The muscular fibres thtsmselves are attached, 1. to the skin, of which mode there are numerous examples in the muscles of the face ; 2. to other muscular fibres, as in many muscles of the face and of the tongue; 3. to cartilages, as in several of the muscles of the chest and larynx; 4. to aponeuroses, of -which they act as tensors, and whose power of resistance they thereby increase ; lastly, to tendons or aponeuroses *, that are themselves attached to the bones. The fleshy fibres are inserted into, or become continuous with the tendons and aponeuroses in the following manner :—the tendon is prolonged under the form of a membrane, either upon the surface or in the substance of the muscle. The results of this arrangement are, 1. an increase of surface for the attach- ment of the muscular fibres, which the tendon gathers up, as it were, in order to concentrate their efforts upon one point; 2. an obliquity in the insertion of the fibres, in reference to the axis of the entire muscle, by which the direction of the power is represented. It may easily be conceived, that this obliquity is of the greatest interest as regards the dynamic relations or active property of the muscles.f One of the most curious circumstances respecting the continuity of a tendon or an aponeurosis with a muscle, is the very intimate union between the mus- cular and fibrous tissues, which is so complete that they are scarcely ever separated by external violence, which moreover tends to lacerate the muscle rather than the tendinous fibres. It is a fact worthy of notice, and one which we have already had frequent occasion to remark, that the adhesion of any two organic tissues is stronger than the respective cohesion of each; so that the tissues themselves wUl sooner break than admit of separation from one another. Insertion of *Jie aponeuroses and tendons into the bones. A tendon or an apo- neurosis forms a species of ligament, by means of which the action of a very large muscle is transmitted to the lever intended to be moved, by a fibrous cord or aponeurotic lamina of small size. A great advantage arises from this mode of economising the extent of bony surface required for muscular attachments. For, notwithstanding the extent of surface afforded by the expanded ends of the bones, and by the eminences and ridges with which they are covered, it would be evidently insufficient, were the muscular fibres to be directly attached. The existence of tendons and aponeuroses produces also this remarkable result, viz. that the muscular insertions are much stronger than they would otherwise have been. The aponeurotic tissue acts as a transition structure, being in some points of its organisation analogous to bone, and in others approaching that of muscle. The analogy between the bony and fibrous tissues is confirmed by the frequent occurrence of ossification in the latter, even under normal conditions, as, may be observed in the formation of the sesamoid bones, and also in the mode by which tendons are attached. It has been observed, in fact, that at the point of junction of the tendons with the bones there is a sort of mutual fusion of the tissues, from which so intimate a connection results, that the proper substance of the tendons always give way before they can be separated from the bones, their attachments to which even maceration will scarcely destroy. . . Of the different bones with which a muscle is connected some remam mi- movable during its contraction, whilst others are put in motion ; hence the distinction between fixed and 7novable attachments. But this emmently useful distinction must not be taken in an absolute sense ; it is only rigorously true of fl very smaU number of muscles, which, like some of those found m the face being connected by one extremity with the skin and by the other with the bones? can give rise to movements only at their cutaneous attachments. » [The tendons afford examples of the fascicular form of Bbrous tissue, for a notice of which 'in'farT'^af the tendon and the aponeuroses by which it is continued into the muscle, repre- sent t"idrection 0™!^?^ the fleshy fibres must necessarily be attached to it more or less obU.i'Iely It is not our Sitcntion to examine Tiere the great loss of power which this arrange- ment involves.STRUCTURE OF MUSCLES. 249 In the greater number of muscles, on the contrary, although one of the at- tachments is most commonly fixed and the other movable, yet their relative condition may be changed, and they may become alternately fixed and mov- able ; it is therefore necessary, in explaining the action of a muscle, carefully to notice the supposed mobiUty or fixedness of the different attachments at the time. • T_ X. In comparing such attachments as are habitually fixed with those that are constantly movable, we shaU observe that the former are either numerous or spread out by means of aponeuroses, whereas the latter consist of very accu- rately circumscribed tendons. The figurative expressions of head and tail, given to the ends of a muscle, refer to this arrangement. The fixed attach- ment of a muscle is usually blended with those of several others, while the movable one is distinct.* In order to facilitate our description we shall inva- riably designate the fixed attachment of a muscle, its oriyin, and the movable attachment, its termination or insertion. Structure of Muscles. Muscles are composed of two kinds of fibres : 1. of red or contractile fibres, which form the muscular tissue properly so called; 2. of white, strong, and non-contractile fibres, constituting the tendons and aponeuroses. In speaking of the ligaments, we mentioned the general properties of tendons and aponeu- roses as belonging to the fibrous tissues; we shall now make a few remarks on the peculiar characters of muscular tissue. 1. Colour. Muscular tissue is of a reddish colour, the intensity of which varies in different muscles and in different individuals. This colour is not an essential character even in the human subject, for the contractile fibres of the intestinal canal are very pale f; stiU less is it so in the lower animals, some of which have the entire muscular system perfectly colourless. The red colour of the muscular fibre is independent of the blood contained within the vessels of the muscle. 2. Consistence. The consistence of the muscular fibres varies in different subjects : in some it is soft and easily torn; in others it is firmer and more re- sisting, and retains for some time after death a degree of rigidity which yields with difficulty to forcible extension. Structure The muscles may be divided into bundles or fasciculi of different orders, and these again into distinct fibres, which are visible to the naked eye. and rendered more apparent, either by dissection, or by the action of alcohol, of diluted nitric acid, or even of boiling watei'. They are of a variable shape, resembling prisms of three, four, five, or six sm-faces, but are never cylin- drical. Their length also varies in different muscles, in but a few of which do they extend parallel to each other throughout the entire length of the fleshy belly. Each muscle is surroimded by a sheath of cellular tissue, which also pene- trates into its substance, and surrounds both the fasciculi and fibres. This cellular tissue permits the free motion of the different fasciculi upon one another, whilst it serves at the same time to isolate each and combine the whole. X The chemical analysis of muscular tissue shows that it is composed of a small quantity of free lactic acid {Berzelius) ; gelatin; some salts; osmazome * [Tliis assertion must be taken with some limitation.

Braconnot. {Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. torn, viii.)* In addition to the tendinous and fleshy fibres, vessels, nerves, and cellular tissue also enter into the composition of muscles. We have already described the disposition of the cellular tissue contained in these organs; the mode of distribution of their vessels and nerves will be more appropriately alluded to in the description of the vascular and nervous systems.f Uses of Muscles The muscles are the active organs of motion, constituting the source of the power that is applied to the various levers represented by the component parts of the skeleton. The movements produced are the result of that peculiar pro- perty possessed by the muscles, of shortening themselves, which is called muscular contractility {myotilM). The shortening of a muscle is termed its contraction, and the opposite state its relaxation. Phenomena of muscular contraction. During contraction the muscular fibres become folded in a zig-zag manner throughout their entire length; the muscle itself becomes hardened, and broader and thicker in proportion to the amount smaUer elementary parts named ^tamenis (the primitive fibres of MiiUer). All these elements of the muscular tissue extend parallel to each other, from one tendinous attachment to another, never having been seen to bifurcate or coalesce. In man the. fibres vary from J^th to gigth of an inch in diameter; the transverse stnse upon them are parallel, generally straight, but occasionally slightly waved or curved ; they are situ- ated at intervals of from .jjLjjth to ij^th of an inch. . . , • The fflamen<s are varicose or beaded, /. e., alternately enlarged and contracted; their diameter is from -r^th to rJn^th of an inch.

A distinction should be drawn between the force tithe velocity or rapidity of muscular contraction Again, the velocity is yery different from the extent of motion t the latter depends upon the length of the fibres; the former has no connection with it, but varies accordmg to the constitution of the individual, and is probably dependent on a more or less rapid influx of nervous influence. a„„^^/i;^„ The muscular force is composed of a great number of elements. According to Borelli, an intrinsic and an effective force may be distmguished m each muscle. The intrinsic force is that power which the muscular fibres woald exert if they were in the most favourable position for contraction ; the ettect- ive force is measured by the result. The estimation of the force of a muscle presupposes a knowledge, 1. of the number of its fibres; 2. of their quality or constitution ; 3. of the nature of the lever upon which it acts; 4. of the angle of incidence of the muscle upon that lever ; and 5. of the angle of incidence of the fibres with respect to the imaginary axis of the muscle. 1. Each muscular fibre, being distinct from those around it, may be considered as a small power; it may therefore be easily conceived, that the greater the number of fibres in any muscle, the more energetic will be its contraction. 2. The quality and constitution of the fibre, and the intensity of the stimulus, have no less an influence upon the contractile force of a muscle than the num- ber of its fibres. To be convinced of this, it is sufficient to compare the energy of movement in an individual excited by anger, with that in one who is calm. 3. The determination of the kind of lever f, represented by the bone upon * The observations of Rogerus tend to show that rapid contractions and relaxations are constantly taking place in muscles, especially during their contraction. (Tr.) " De Perpetua Fibrarum Musculanum Palpitatione," 1760. t A lever, in mechanics, signifies an inflexible rod ca- pable of turning round a point. The point upon which the lever turns is called the fulcrum (J, figs. 103,104,105.); the cause of motion is called the power (p); and the ob- stacle to t)e surmounted is the resistance (r) ; the space between the fulcrum and the power is the power-arm of the lever; the space between the fulcrum and the weight, is the resistance-arm of the lever. There are three kinds of levers, distinguished by the respective arrangement of the three parts :—1. A lever of the first order (fig. 103.) has the fulcrum between the power and the resistance ; 2. A lever of the second order (Jig. 104.) has the resistance between the fulcrum and the power ; 3. A lever qf the third order (fig. 105.) has the power between the resistance and the fulcrum.MYOLOGY. 252 which the muscle acts, is a fundamental point in studying muscular action. It IS a law in mechanics, that the power acts with greater effect, in proportion as its arm of the lever exceeds in length that of the resistance. The most common lever in the human body is that of the third order, in which the power being applied between the fulcrum and the weight, is therefore most disadvantageously situated for action. 4. As far as regards energy of movement the lever to which the power is applied is as unfavourable as possible, because the muscles are generally in- serted near the fulcrum. But as a sort of compensation, an advantage peculiar to animal mechanics, the motions gain in velocity and extent what they lose in force, which, however, may still be obtained by an increase in the number of muscles, and of the fleshy fibres of each muscle. Nevertheless levers of the most favourable construction, and of the most advantageous position are met with in situations where considerable force is required; as in the articu- lation of the foot with the leg, presenting an example of a lever of the second order, and in the articulation of the head with the vertebral column, forming a lever of the first order. The angle of incidence most favourable to the power, is the right angle; but in the human body, as the muscles are arranged in layers upon the bones which they are intended to move, they are for the most part inserted at very acute angles. Their incidence would be stUl more unfavourable, were it not for the enlargement of the articular extremities of the bones, which disturb the parallelism of the muscles. Besides, in certain cases, the angle of incidence more or less approaches or even attains to a right angle, and is combined with an extremely advantageous lever, when such an arrangement is required ; as in the articulation of the foot with the leg. It is of importance to notice, in determining the action of a muscle, that its incidence upon the bone varies at different periods during its action ; so that a muscle, which is almost parallel to the lever, when it begins to contract, becomes perpendicular to it at a given moment during that process. It may be said that the momentum of a muscle occurs at that period of its action when its perpendicular incidence gives it the utmost energy of which it is capable: thus, the momentum of the action of the biceps femoris takes place when the leg forms a right angle with the thigh. In a certain number of muscles the momentum coin- cides with the commencement of action; such as the gastrocnemii and the solei. In some muscles the angle of incidence remains the same throughout the whole time of their action, and consequently they have no momentum: this is the case with the deltoid. The angle of incidence of the muscular fibres, with regard to the imaginary axis of the muscle or the terminating tendon, involves a loss of power pro- portional to the amount of the angle. In some muscles the aponeuroses form a continuation of the fleshy fibres ; in others, the angle of incidence of the muscular fibre is so acute that it may be left out of consideration. Estimation of the action or uses of the muscles. Since the contraction of a muscle consists in its shortening, it follows that its action may be determined, a priori, from a knowledge merely of its attachments and direction. It may also be ascertained experimentally, by placing a limb in such a position that the muscle in question shall be perfectly relaxed. As the same muscle gener- ally performs several uses, it is necessary to place the limb in several different positions, so as to determine those in which the muscle becomes relaxed. Let us take for example, the glutaeus maximus. If we desire to relax this muscle completely, it is necessary, 1. to extend the thigh upon the pelvis ; 2. to abduct it • 3 to rotate it outwards: hence, it follows that the glutajus maxmius is at'once an extensor, an abductor, and a rotator outwards of the thigh. As a counterproof, the limb must be placed in such a condition that the muscle becomes completely stretched. The successive positions in which a muscle becomes stretched will be the very reverse of those which the limb assumes during the contraction of the muscle. Thus, the gluta;us maximus is slightly253 PREPARATION OF MUSCLES. stretched by rotation inwards, more so by adduction, and most completely by flexion of the thigh upon the pelvis. . „ ■, , ^ In determining the action of a muscle that is reflected over any angle of a bone, it is necessary to put out of consideration aU that portion of the muscle intervening between its origin and its angle of reflection, and to suppose the power to operate directly from the latter points. i_. , i. The action of sphincter muscles is to close the orifices around which they are placed. A curviUnear muscle assumes a rectilinear direction, at the very commencement of its action. The insertions of a muscle are neither equally fixed, nor equaUy moveable. The fixed point of a muscle is that extremity which remains immoveable during contraction; but in certain cases the fixed may become the moveable point: this must be taken into consideration in determining the action of a muscle. The fixed point is most commonly that which is nearest to the ti-unk. But, with few exceptions, it is never completely stationary; and since a muscle would lose much of its power when acting between a moveable and an imperfectly fixed point, it is necessary that the latter should be kept as immoveable as pos- sible by the contraction of other muscles. These consecutive contractions are often very extensive, and should be familiar both to the physician and the physiologist. When a muscle passes over several articulations, it moves them all in suc- cession, commencing with the one nearest to the moveable insertion. Those muscles which concur in producing the same motion are called con- generous ; those which execute opposite movements are termed antagonists: thus all the flexor muscles of any region are congenerous, and they are anta- gonists to the extensors. Two muscles may be congenerous at one time, and act as antagonists at an- other : when they contract simultaneously, their individual and opposite effects are destroyed, and a common and intermediate eifect results; thus when the flexor carpi ulnaris, which is both an adductor and a flexor, acts in conjunction with the extensor carpi ulnaris, which is an adductor and extensor, the hand is neither flexed nor extended, but is merely adducted. We shall constantly have occasion to notice this arrangement, which appears to me calculated to give much greater precision of motion, than if two perfectly congenerous muscles had been employed. There are also certain compound motions, which are as it were the results of two different movements ; thus, when the flexors and the adductors of the thigh act simultaneously, the femur passes in the intermediate direction. It is from this kind of combination that the movement of circumduction is pro- duced by the action of the four orders of muscles situated at the extremities of the antero-posterior and transverse diameters of the joint. These four orders of muscles are known by the names of flexors, extensors, adductors, and abductors. Lastly, muscles may contract without producing any motions, as when an- tagonist muscles act with equal energy. The result of such a simultaneous contraction is an active imviobility ox tonic movement, as the older writers termed it, which is of very great importance. Preparation of Muscles. Dissection. The end to be attained in the dissection of a muscle is to iso- late it accurately from all the surrounding parts, leaving only those connec- tions which are compatible with that object. Since, however, it is sometimes impossible to preserve the relations, and at the same time isolate the muscle, It then becomes necessary to be provided with two preparations for the de- monstration or study of the same muscle. In order to isolate a muscle, the surrounding cellular tissue, which often tornis a very adherent sheath, must be removed; and to do this completely,MYOLOGY. 254 1. Make a section of the skin parallel to the fibres of the muscle, deep enough to reach the muscle thi-ough the sheath; 2. As soon as the flap of skin can be grasped by the hand, stretch and separate it from the muscle by cutting with the scalpel in the angle formed by these two parts. 3. When the superficial surface is exposed, proceed to separate the deep surface, preserving as much as possible all its important relations. 4. Then dissect the extremities, mark- ing out their limits with the greatest care. In the study of the muscular system, great importance should be attached to the choice of subjects. Robust and tolerably fat subjects are best adapted for this purpose. Preservation of muscles in liquids. Alcohol, oil of turpentine, a mixture of equal parts of these, or solutions of the bichloride of mercury, or persulphate of iron, may be employed for the preservation of muscles, though they alter many of their properties, such as their colour, consistence, &c. Preparations by desiccation. As this kind of preparation requires a peculiar method, we refer to the special treatises upon anatomical preparations for an account of them. (Vide tke works of MM. Marjolin and Louth.^ Order of Description of tlie Muscles. Before passing to the description of the particular muscles, it is necessary to determine in what order they shall be studied. Galen divided the body for this purpose into regions, and described the muscles of each in their order of super-imposition. In place of this arrangement which is purely topogra- phical, Vesalius substituted a physiological one founded upon a consideration of the uses of the muscles. This order was adopted by Winslow, who named the different muscular regions in the following manner : —Muscles which move the shoulder upon the trunk—muscles which move the arm upon the scapula, &c. Albinus revived fhe method pursued by Galen, and divided the muscles into forty-eight regions in the male, and forty-six in the female. He was followed by Sabatier, and by Vicq-d'Azyr, who brought the arrangement to perfection by establishing some Subdivisions in the groups formed by Albinus. Thus modified, it has been adopted by most modern anatomists ; it is evidently pre- ferable in many respects, since it is essentially anatomical, and is best calcu- lated to exhibit the relations of the different muscles and regions. In regard also to economy of subjects, and facility of dissection, it has many advantages over the physiological order, with which however in many regions it may be made to coincide. We shall therefore adopt this arrangement, modifying it so far as to permit all the muscles to be dissected upon one subject; and after having described all the muscles according to their topographical relations, we shall give a table in which they wiU be grouped in a physiological order.

It is a broad triangular, rather than trapezoid muscle, thick in the middle, thin and elongated at its superior and inferior angles. Attachments. It arises from the spinous pro- cesses of all the dorsal and the seventh cervical vertebra, from the corre- sponding supra-spinous ligaments, from the pos- terior cervical ligament (ligamentum nuchse),and from the internal third of the superior occipital line, and is inserted into the entire length of the spine of the scapula, into the posterior border of the acromion, and into the external third of the posterior border of the clavicle. The fixed at- tachments or origins of this muscle present, 1. a broad, semi-elliptical aponeurosis, which when united to the one on the opposite side, foiTus an ellipse, occupying the space between the sixth cervical and the third dorsal vertebrae; 2. a very thin fibrous lamina, not having the ordinary shining appearance of an aponeurosis, which is fiirmly ad- herent to the skin, and forms the truncated occipital angle of the muscle; 3. a great number of tendinous fibres, constituting all those attachments to the ver- tebrae, that are independent of the two preceding aponeuroses. From these origins all the fleshy fibres proceed outwards, the inferior fibres from below up- wards, the superior from above downwards, and from behind forwards, and the middle ones horizontally. They tenninate in the following manner: — the256 MYOLOGY. lower or ascending fibres are collected together, and attached to a triangular aponeurosis, -which gliding over the small facette at the internal extremity of the spine of the scapula, is inserted into the tubercle immediately connected ■with it; the middle or horizontal fibres terminate at the posterior border of the spine of the scapula, by tendinous fibres which are very distinct, especially towards the acromion; the upper or descending fibres are inserted into the convex portion of the posterior border of the clavicle, many of them being also attached to the upper surface of that bone. Relations. The trapezius is covered by the skin, from which it is separated by an aponeurotic lamina, except at the upper part, where the muscle and in- teguments are intimately adherent. It covers the complexus, splenius, rhom- boideus, and levator anguli scapulae, in the neck; and the serratus posticus superior, the supra-spinatus, the posterior spinal muscles, and the latissimus dorsi, in the back. The most important relations of this muscle are those of its superior and external or occipito-clavicular margin: this forms the poste- rior boundary of the supra-clavicular triangle, which is limited in front by the stemo-mastoid muscle, and below by the clavicle. It should be observed in reference to the indications regarding the supra-clavicular space, furnished by this margin of the trapezius, that it sometimes advances as far as the middle of the clavicle, and has even been observed to become blended with the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid. Action. 1. The upper or descending portion elevates the clavicle, and con- sequently the apex of the shoulder ; but if the shoulder be fixed, this portion of the muscle inclines the head to one side and extends it, and moreover ro- tates it, so that the face is turned to the opposite side. 2. The middle or hori- zontal portion carries the shoulder backwards, but from the obliquity of the spine of the scapula, it also rotates that bone, so that the apex of the shoulder is carried upwards. 3. The lower or ascending portion draws the posterior costa of the scapula inwards and downwards ; and by a species of rotation, which was alluded to when treating of the scapulo-clavicular articulations, also elevates the apex of the shoulder. 4. When the whole of the muscle contracts at once, the scapula is drawn inwards, and the apex of the shoulder is raised. TJie Latissimus Dorsi and Teres Major. Dissection. 1. Render the latissimus dorsi tense, by the same means as were employed for the trapezius, and also by withdrawing the arm from the side. 2. Make an incision in the median line from the tenth dorsal vertebra to the sacrum, and another transversely from the same vertebra to the pos- terior border of the axilla, dividing in the latter incision a fibro-cellular mem- brane, which adheres very firmly to the fleshy fibres. 3. Dissect the humeral insertion very carefully, and at the same time prepare the teres major, which is very intimately related to this extremity. The Latissimus Dorsi. The latissimus dorsi (^b, fig. 106.; p,figs. 109, 110.) occupies the lumbar and part of the dorsal region, and the posterior border of the axUla. It is the broadestof aU the muscles, and shaped like a triangle, havmg its inferior angle truncated, and its upper and external angles considerably elongated. Attachments. It arises from the spinous processes of the last six or seven dorsal, of all the lumbar, and of the sacral vertebrse, from the posterior third of the crest of the ilium, and from the last four ribs, and is inserted mto the bottom of the bicipital groove of the humerus, not into its posterior border. Its oriffin from the crest of the ilium and from the vertebrae is effected through the medium of a triangular aponeurosis, narrow and thm above, broad and very strong below, where it is blended with the aponeuroses of tiie serratus posticus inferior and obliquus internus abdommis, and with the poste-257 THE TERES MAJOR. rior layer of the aponeurosis of the transversus abdominis. This aponeurosis assists in forming the sheath of the sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, and trans- verso-spinalis. The costal origins consist of fleshy tongues or digitations, which ai-e interposed between similar processes of the external oblique. From this threefold origin the fleshy fibres proceed in the following manner: the upper pass horizontally, the middle are directed obliquely, and the lower ver- tically upwards ; they all converge, so as to form a thick fasciculus, directed towards the inferior angle of the scapula, from which it often receives some accessory fibres. The muscle is then twisted upon itself, so that the inferior or vertical fibres become first anterior and then superior, while the superior or horizontal fibres become first posterior, and then inferior. This torsion may perhaps be intended to prevent displacement of the fibres. They all terminate iu a flat quadrilateral tendon, which is inserted into the bottom of the bicipital groove, above the insertion of the tendon of the pectoralis major. This tendon furnishes a fibrous expansion continuous with the fascia of the arm, and also a band which extends to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus. Relations. This muscle is covered by the skin (from which it is separated by a closely adherent fibro-celliilar sheath), and by the inferior angle of the trapezms. It covers the posterior spinal muscles, the serratus posticus infe- rior, the external mtercostals, the serratus magnus, the lower angle of the sca- pula, the rhomboideus, and lastly the teres major, by which muscle it is itself covered m its turn. Its external margm is in relation with the posterior border of the external oblique, from which it is separated below by a smaU triangular mterval. The upper part of the external margin, together with the teres major, forms the posterior border of the axiUa; and from the same mar- gin a muscular fasciculus occasionally extends beneath the axilla to the lower edge of the pectorahs major.

The latissimus dorsi adducts the arm, rotates it inwards, and at the same time draws it backwards (hence its name, ani scalptor). When only the upper or horizontal fibres contract the arm is carried inwards and backwards ; when the lower fibres act alone, it is carried downwards. ... , « .1. i .• •„ The uses of the teres riajor are precisely similar to those of the latissimus dorsi, to which it is congenerous and accessory, and with which it is always associated in action, drawing the humerus inwards, backwards, and down- wards When the humerus is the fixed point, the latissimus dorsi raises the trunk' and with the greater facility, because it is attached to the ribs, the s^ine and the pelvis. In consequence of its costal attachments, the latissimus dorsiV a muscle of inspiration; and it should be observed, that the direction of its fibres, which is almost perpendicular to the ribs, enables it to act with great power.

Attachments. It arises from the posterior tubercles of the transverse pro' cesses of the three or four superior cervical vertebrae, externally to the sple- nius, and behind the scalenus posticus ; it is inserted into the superior angle of the scapula (whence its name), and into all that portion of its internal costa situated above the spine. The cervical attachments of this muscle consist of four tendons, to which suc- ceed an equal number of fleshy fasciculi, at first distinct, but afterwards united into one bundle, which proceeds downwards, backwards, and outwards, and spreads out to be inserted into the scapula by short aponeurotic fibres. Relations. It is covered by the trapezius, the sterno-mastoid, and the skin ; and it lies superficially to the splenius, the sacro-lumbalis, the transversalis colli, and the serratus posticus superior. Action. When its upper attachment is fixed, this muscle carries the pos- terior angle of the scapula upwards and forwards, and consequently rotates that bone so as to depress the apex of the shoulder. It conspires with the rhom- boid and the trapezius in elevating the entire shoulder, and with the rhomboid in depressing its apex, in this respect acting as an antagonist to the trapezius. When the fixed point is below, which must be very rarely, it inclines the neck backwards and to its own side. TJie Serrati Postici. These are two in number, a superior and an inferior. Dissection. 1. To expose the superior muscle, divide and reflect the tra- pezius arid the rhomboid, and draw the scapula forwards; — 2, To display the inferior, raise the latissimus dorsi with great care, as its deep aponeurosis is blended with that of the serratus posticus inferior; — 3. Preserve the thin aponeurosis extending between the two serrati muscles.* 1. The serratus posticus superior is situated at the upper and back part of the thorax, and is of an irregularly quadrilateral figure. Attachments. It arises from the ligamentum nuchae and the spinous pro- cesses of the seventh cervical and of the two or three upper dorsal vertebree and is inserted into the upper borders of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs. The vertebral attachment consists of a very thin aponeurosis, the fibres of which are parallel and inclined downwards and outwards. From this aponeurosis, which constitutes at least the inner half of the muscle the fleshy fibres proceed m the same direction, and almost immediately divide into four digitations, which are inserted into the ribs by means of short tencUnous fibres. The superior digitation is attached near the angle of the corresponding rib, and each of the others at successively greater distances from it 2. The serratus posticus inferior {lyyvaho-CQSiaXis, Chaussier, g, fig. 106.) is also of an irregularly quadrilateral form, and is situated at the lower part of the back, and the upper part of the loins.

Relations. These two muscles have certain relations in common, and there are some peculiar to each. They both cover the longissimus dorsi, the sacro- lumbalis, the transverso-spinalis, the ribs, and the corresponding intercostal muscles. The superior is covered by the rhomboideus, the trapezius, and the serratus magnus, and covers the splenius and transversalis colli. The inferior is covered by the latissimus dorsi, with the aponeurosis of which muscle its own aponeurotic lamina is so closely united, that it is impossible to separate them completely; audit covers the posterior layer of the aponeurosis of the transversalis. Action. Besides certdn common uses, each muscle has its own peculiar ac- tion. One important common use is to retain in the vertebral groove those muscles of the back, which from their extreme length are the most liable to displacement. This effect is produced by their fleshy portions rendering tense their aponeurotic expansions. With regard to the actions proper to each, 1. the superior elevates those ribs into which it is inserted, and is consequently a muscle of inspiration; 2. the inferior, on the other hand, is a depressor of the ribs, and therefore a muscle of expiration.

The splenius (i,fys. 106. 113,114.), so named because it has been com- pared to the spleen (o-irX^/v), is situated at the posterior part of the neck, and upper part of the back. It is a broad muscle, terminating in a point below, and dividing into two portions above. » , „ c Attachments. It arises from the spinous processes of the tour or tve supe- rior dorsal and the seventh cervical vertebrte, from the corresponding supra- spinous ligaments, and also from the ligamentum nuchse, between the seventh and the tWrd cervical vertebra : it is inserted, 1. into the transverse processes of the first, second, and often of the third cervical vertebrae; 2. into the ex- ternal surface and posterior border of the mastoid process, and the external thii-d of the rough space beneath the superior semi circular line of the occi- pital bone The spinal attachments consist of tendinous fibres, the most mfe- rior of which are the longest. From these the fleshy fibres proceed obhquely upwards and outwards, the lower being longer and more vertical, and form a broad flat muscle, which is much thicker externally, and soon becomes di- V ded iito two po;tions-one smaller, inferior and external the other much Wer superior and internal.

By its insertions into the second and third cervical vertebrae it tends to rotate these in the same direction. When the two muscles act together, the head is drawn directly backwards. The splenius is therefore an extemor and rotator of the head and of the neck ; it assists in supporting the head m the erect position, and prevents it from inclining forwards in obedience to the force of gravity. Tlie Posterior Spinal Muscles. As these muscles are arranged in a peculiar manner, we shall adopt a me- thod of description in some measure different from that which we have else- where employed. ^ -l. The posterior spinal or long muscles of the back (see fig. 107.) are three in number, viz. the sacro-lumbalis, the longissimus dorsi, and the transversa- SpiTlClIlS TlVUSclSt These three muscles, which extend the entire length of the spine, form a very large muscular mass, completely filling up the corresponding vertebral groove. This mass is small at the lower part of the sacral groove, becomes much enlarged in the loins, then diminishes in the back, and again acquires a considerable size in the neck. Chaussier has given a description of them under the collective name of the sacrospinal muscle ; and they have also been denominated the erector spina. I shall describe the three muscles together; but in order to adopt some ar- rangement in a matter so complicated, I shall divide them into three portions, viz. a lumbo-sacral, a thoracic, and a cervical. Lumbo-sacral Portion of the Posterior Spinal Muscles. Dissection. 1. Render this portion of the muscle tense, by placing a block under the abdomen: 2. Divide by a vertical incision the trapezius, splenius, rhomboideus, latissimus dorsi, and serrati postici; reflect the divided portions inwards and outwards. A young subject, from ten to twelve years of age, is best adapted for the study of these muscles, from the facility with which the different fasciculi may be separated. For the same reason, one that is much infiltrated with serum is preferable to one in which the parts are dry. The lumbo-sacral portion is usually called the common mass of the sacro- lumbalis and longissimus dorsi. It forms the fleshy part of the loins, and is called the fillet in the lower animals : it is the most highly developed in man, in whom it exerts a constant and powerful action during the erect posture : it appears to be the common origin of the posterior spinal muscles, whence the name of common mass : it fills up entirely the lumbo-sacral groove, and even pro- jects backwards and laterally in robust subjects. It is of small size in the sacral region, is much enlarged at the middle of the lumbar region, at the upper part of which it again diminishes, so as to re- semble two cones united by their bases. Attachments. The common mass arises from the whole extent of the sacro- iliac groove, and from the anterior surface and external border of an extremely strong aponeurosis, formed of parallel vertical fibres, and strengthened by a superficial layer directed obliquely. This aponeurosis of origin for the posterior spinal muscles (d,fig. 107.) is inserted on the inside to the sacral ridge, to the summits of the spinous processes of the lumbar and three lower dorsal verte- brse, and to the corresponding supra-spinous ligaments: on the outside, to the series of eminences representing the transverse processes of the sacral verte- brae, and to the back part of the crest of the ilium: it gives attachment to many of the fibres of the glutaius maximus. It is short on the outside, and very long on the inside, reaching in the latter direction to the middle of the dorsal region under the foi-m of paraUel and regular bands {d,fig. 107.). Arismg from these different origins the common mass appears at first ex- tremely simple in its composition, consisting of fibres passing vertically up- 8 3MYOLOGY. 262 107. wards. But if the aponeurosis be detached from its spinal insertions, and turned outwards, it will be seen that the common mass is essentially composed of two portions — one internal and anterior, the lumbosacral portion of the transverso-spinalis; and the other external and posterior, the lumbosacral por- tion of the sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi. 1. The lumbosacral portion of the transversospinalis * occupies all the sacral groove, and that part of the lumbar groove situated within the articular pro- cesses. It is perfectly distinct in the loins, being separated from the common mass by loose cellular tissue traversed by vessels and nerves. It arises from the articular processes of the lumbar vertebrae by flat tendons, directed ob- liquely inwards and upwards, and terminating upon the posterior surface of the muscle : by the union of their contiguous edges an aponeurosis is formed, which is itself blended along one of its borders with the deep surface of the common aponeurosis of origin. From these tendons the fleshy fibres arise, and having united into bundles, terminate by other tendons at the spinous pro- cesses of the vertebrae above. In the sacral region this portion of the trans- verso-spinalis is less distinct, but it may be easily seen that it occupies the whole of the sacral groove, and that the corresponding portion of the aponeu- rosis of origin affords attachments to it alone. 2. The external and posterior portion of the common mass, or lumbosacral portion of the sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi, is entirely without the sacral groove, but occupies that part of the lum- bar groove situated on the outer side of the articular processes. It arises, 1. from all the lumbar portion of the common aponeurosis ; 2. from an extremely strong tendon, which is attached to the posterior superior spinous process of the ilium j 3. from the posterior fourth of the crest of the Uium, internally by ten- dinous, and externally by muscular fibres. The thick fleshy mass proceeding from these difierent origins is disposed of in the following manner:—the greater part of the fibres pass directly upwards to the dorsal region, forming the proper com- mencement of the sacro-lumbalis (a a, fig. 107.). The remaining fibres are directed forwards, and are arranged into two sets of bundles, one of which is inserted into the summits of the transverse processes, form- ing the external or transverse fasciculi ; and the other into the tubercles of the articular processes, forming the internal or articular fasciculi. These two sets of fibres consti- tute the proper origin of the longissimus dorsi (d d, fig. 107.). Relations. The common mass is co- vered behind by the united aponeuroses of the latissimus dorsi and serratus posticus inferior, and by the posterior layer of the aponeurosis of the transversalis ; in front, it corresponds to the lumbar groove, the inter-transversales muscles of the loins, and the middle layer of the aponeurosis of the transversalis, which separates it from the quadratus liunborum; on the inside, * [This corresponds to the inferior or lumbo-sacral fasciculi of the multifidus spina:.]THE POSTERIOR SPINAL MUSCLES. 263 B 4 A ti,» cninnii-; m'ocesses: and on the outside, to the angle TZT^^enV"^^::^-^^^^^^ layers of the aponeuro^s of the transveS!

The transverso-spinalis muscle may be completely isolated from the others inthl reSn Wehave seen the distinction between the sacro-lumbalis and lon- eSus dorsi coLnenced at the upper part of the lumbar region ; m the back fheyTe completely separated by some loose ceUular tissue and the posterior branches of the dorsal nerves and vessels. . ^ ^ S thoracic portion of the sacro-lumbalis {b b', fig. 107.) consists of a con- tinuation of the vertical or external fibres of the common mass; as it proceeds upwids it becomes more and more slender, and is divided into a series of fasciculi which are inserted successively into the angles of the ribs, by means of tendilious prolongations, that extend for a considerable distance upon the posterior surface of the muscle. It was the existence of these aponeurotic pro- cesses the contiguous edges of which are often united, that induced Winslow to compare the muscle to a pahn leaf. In this manner the muscular fasciculi are soon expended, terminating at about the sixth rib, but the muscle itself is continued into the neck by means of accessory fibres, which may be exposed by turning the muscle outwards, after separating it from the longissimus dorsi (as at b') : twelve long thin tendons will then be seen to arise from the upper portion of the angles of the twelve ribs, and to pass outwai-ds and upwards : to these succeed fleshy fasciculi, which tenninate in aponeurotic processes, situated on their posterior surfaces, and having precisely the opposite direction. These accessory bundles (c c', fig. 107.; i,fig. 108.) have been very weU described by Diemerbroek under the name of cervicales descendens, and by Steno under that oimusculus accessoritis ad sacro- lumbalem; the four or five superior bundles form the transversaire grele of Winslow, and the cervicalis descendens of Albinus. The thoracic portion of the longissimus dorsi (e e',fig. 107.) is larger than the preceding muscle, to the inner side of which it is situated: it diminishes much less rapidly, because the common aponeurosis (d) is extended in the form of bands upon its posterior aspect, which afford attachment to additional fleshy fibres. This muscle is a continuation of the internal or articular, and the ex- ternal or transverse fasciculi, described as existing in the lumbar region, and is itself divided into three orders of fasciculi, one external and two internal. I. The external or costal fasciculi form the continuation of the transverse bundles of the lumbar portion of the muscle, and are inserted by very thin tendons into the space between the angles of the ribs and the summits of the dorsal transverse processes (e',fig. 107.). 2. The first set of internal or the spinous fasciculi are inserted into the spinous processes of the five or six superior dorsal vertebrae; and as they arise from tendinous bands attached to the summits of the spinous processes of the lower dorsal vertebrae, and of that of the first lumbar vertebra, Winslow considered them as forming a separate muscle, which he called le long Spineux du dos (spinalis dorsi, /, fig. 107.). 3. The second set of internal, or the transverse fasciculi, are a continuation of the articular fasciculi of the lumbar region; they constitute the principal ter- mination of the longissimus dorsi, and are attached by very long and thin ten- dons to the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae. The thoracic portion of the transverso-spinalis* (partly seen in fig. 108.) is reduced to a very narrow band, concealed by the longissimus dorsi: it arises by very long and delicate tendons from the lower dorsal transverse processes, and is inserted by others equally similar, long and slender, into the summits of * [This corresponds to the semispinalis dorsi, and to the dorsal portion of the multifidus spin® of Albinus.]MYOLOGY. 264 the superior dorsal spinous processes, some pale fleshy fibres connectinc the two series of tendons. Connections. The dorsal portion of the posterior spinal muscles entirely fills the dorsal groove, limited on the outer side by the angles of the ribs. They are covered by several muscular layers, the nearest of which is formed by the two serrati postLci and their connecting aponeurosis, which completes the sheath enclosing the long muscles of the back: they are, moreover, sepa- rated from the skin by the rhomboid, trapezius, and latissimus dorsi. The Cervical Portion of the Posterior Spinal Muscles, the Transversalis Colli, and the Trachelo-mastoideus. Cervical portion of the sacro-lumbalis, or cervicalis descendens. The sacro- lumbalis, whose original fibres are found to terminate at and upon the sixth rib, is continued by means of its accessory fasciculi (c c',fig. 107.) up to the transverse processes of the four or five inferior cervical vertebrae (i,fig. 108.), into the summits of which it is inserted by very slender tendons. The number of these terminating fasciculi varies in a remarkable manner. Indeed, the splenius, the transversalis colli, the sacro-lumbalis, and even the levator anguh scapulae, are so closely connected, that upon examining their cervical insertions only, these might all be ascribed to a single muscle. The cervical portion of the sacro-lumbalis is covered by the levator anguli scapulae, and can only be exposed by turning this muscle outwards. The cervical portion of the longissimus dorsi, or the transversalis colli, and the trachelo-mastoid. The extent of the longissimus dorsi is limited to the back; its highest internal or spinous fasciculus seldom reaches the spinous process of the first dorsal vertebra: its highest external or costal fasciculus is attached to the second, sometimes even to the fourth rib, and its highest transverse fasciculus is inserted into the transverse process of the first dorsal vertebra. In some very rare cases a few internal fasciculi reach the cervical vertebne: I have seen one of them terminate by becoming attached both to the transverse process of the third cervical vertebra and to the complexus. The longissimus dorsi is, however, prolonged by accessory fasciculi as far as the third cervical vertebra. These fascicuU can only be identified by their direction (for they can never be completely separated from this muscle): they form a distinct muscle known as the transversalis colli (transversalis cervicis, Albinus, g g, fig. 107.). By reflecting outwards the upper part of the longissimus dorsi, they may be exposed, varying in number, and arising from the summits of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and sometimes seventh and eighth dorsal vertebrae by long thin tendons, and inserted by other tendons into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the five inferior cervical ver- tebra {I, fig. 108.): the transversalis colli is covered by the longissimus dorsi, the splenius, and levator anguli scapulae, and rests upon the trachelo-mastoid and complexus. The trachelo-mastoideus (complexus minor, ii,fig. 107.) may be regarded as another accessory muscle to the longissimus dorsi, -which it continues up to the head. In order to expose its origin the transversalis colli must be reflected outwards (as va.fig. 107.). It arises from the angles between the transverse and articular processes of the four inferior cervical vertebrae, by four small tendons; or sometimes by a continuous aponeurotic plane. From thence the fibres pro- ceed upwards, and form a small muscle which is inserted into the mastoid process, in a small furrow to the inside of the digastric groove. This small muscle is almost always interrupted by a tendinous intersection near its mastoid insertion. . -.^, j- The cervical portion of the transverso-spinalts.* While the preceding * If wc were to follow the ortler of super- imposition rigorously, the complexus should be described before this muscle, which cannot be brought into view until the former is removed.265 THE POSTERIOR SPINAL MUSCLES. muscles present only a few fasciculi in the neck, the transverso-spinalis * undergoes an enlargement in this region, so as to occupy the entire cervical groove (a and b,fig. 108.). In camivora, this portion of the muscle is enor- mously developed (much more so than in man), in consequence of those animals using the head and neck in seizing or struggling with prey. In mammalia, as in man, the dorsal portion of the transverso-spinalis is, as it were, hut a rudiment in the lumho-sacral region; the muscle is larger in man than in other animals, on account of his erect posture. Albinus de- scribed the enlarged cervical portion as a separate muscle, viz. the spinalis cervicis. In the neck, as in the other regions, the transverso-spinalis is a collection of super-imposed fasciculi, which arise from the transverse processes of the five or six upper dorsal, and from the articular processes of the five lower cervical vertebrae, and ai'e inserted into the spinous processes of the six lower cervical vertebra3: the highest and the largest fasciculus is attached to the axis. This muscle, which would have been much better named articulo-spinalis, is com- posed of several layers of fasciculi, placed one above the other, and extending from the whole length of the articular processes and laminae of the vertebrse below, to the whole length of the spinous processes and laminae of the vertebrae above. The length of these layers diminishes progressively from the more superficial {a, fig. 108.) to the deep-seated ones (6); the latter extend only from one vertebral lamina to another, and might be considered as proper muscles of the laminee, and not as a part of the transvei-so-spinahs muscle. The most superficial layer is composed of radiating fasciculi, diverging from one aiticular process to the summits of several of the spmous processes. The Complexus. Dissection. Divide the splenius perpendicularly to the direction of its fibres, and reflect the two parts upwards and downwards ; turn outwards the upper portions of the longissimus dorsi, the transversalis colli, and the trachelo- mastoid (see fig. 107.). The complexus (I, fig. 107.) is situated beneath the splenius at the posterior part of the neck and upper part of the back. It is a flat muscle, broad above but terminating in a point below.

It is not uncommon to find another small digastric fasciculus witli a separate tendon, on the anterior surface of the muscle. Relations. The complexus is covered by the trapezius, splenius, longissimus dorsi, transversalis colli, and trachelo-mastoid, and covers the transveiso- spmalis and the recti and obliqui capitis. Its inner edge is separated from the muscle of the opposite side by a considerable quantity of adipose tissue, and by a prolongation of the ligamentum nuchse. The Interspmales Colli. The interspinales muscles are distinct in the neck only. It is generally ad- mitted that there are five pairs, the first of which extends between the axis and the third cervical vertebra, and the last between the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebrae. They are small quadrilateral muscles extending from one of the borders of the groove in the spinous process below, to the corre- sponding lip of the next process above. Externally they are in relation with the transverso-spinaUs, and are separated from each other intemaUy by ceUular tissue and an aponeurotic lamina.

From this difference of direction, it follows that the rectus major and the two obliqui form on each side an equilateral triangle; in the interval between the two triangles a considerable part of the recti minores is seen. Relations. The recti and obliqui capitis are covered behind by the com- plexus, from which they are separated by a very strong aponeurotic lamina and much cellular tissue; they cover the posterior arch of the atlas, with the posterior ligaments of the atloido-occipital and atloido-axoid articulations. General View of the Posterior Spinal Muscles. After the preceding description it will now be easy to comprehend the ge- neral guiding principles in the arrangement of the innumerable, and at first sight inextricable fasciculi which constitute the fleshy mass known by the ge- neral name of the posterior spinal muscles. We shall first recall to mind, that the levers to which all these muscles are ultimately attached, are, 1. The row of spinous processes ; 2. The row of articular processes ; and 3. The row formed by the transverse processes and the ribs, which for many reasons may be regarded as extensions of those processes. We shall suppose these three series of levers, and therefore the several points of insertion, to be represented by three vertical lines. We must remember also that the dorsal transverse processes are upon the same line as the lumbar and cervical articular processes, and that the ribs are upon the same line as the lumbar transverse processes and the anterior roots of the cervical transverse processes. (See Osteology, p. 31.) These data being admitted we can now reduce all the posterior spinal muscles into the four following orders of fasciculi, two being vertical, and two oblique. 1. The internal vertical or spinous muscles, comprising the spinalis dorsi (i. e. the internal and superficial portion of the longissimus dorsi), the interspinalis of the neck, and the recti postici of the head. 2. The external vertical lateral, or transverse^ muscles, connected with the transverse or costiform processes. They comprise the sacro-lumbalis and the inter-transversales, among which the quadratus lumborum may be included. 3 The spino transverse and spiiio- articular* oblique muscles, including the longissimus dorsi, with its accessories the_ transversalis colli and trachelo-mastoid, the splenius and the obliquus major. 4. The transverso-spinous and articulo-spinous* oblique muscles; viz. the transverso-spinalis, the complexus, and the obliquus capitis minor. Action of the Posterior Spinal Muscles. Having once established the general principles according to which the pos- terior spmal muscles are arranged, it is very easy to determine the mode of action of each, and to reduce to very simple elements a mechanism, to all ap- pearance so complicated. 1. The long and short spinous fasciculi being vertical, directly extend the vertebral column; such is the action of the spinalis dorsi and interspinaUs coui; the recti capitis, at the same time that they extend the head, rotate it also to the side on which the muscles are acting. When the recti muscles of Dom sides act simultaneously the head is drawn directly backwards. 2. Ihe fascicuU of the sacro-lumbalis being vertical and lateral, erect the veneoral column, and incline it to one side, when only one set of muscles acts ; when both sets act together, they extend it directly backwards. •i.

But from their ob- liquity they produce a slight movement of rotation, those fibres -which are at- tached to the articular processes having less effect than those connected with the transverse processes. In this movement the front of the body is turned to the side on which the muscles are situated. When the muscles of both sides act together the spine is extended directly backwards. The splenius, which is the representative of the longissimus dorsi for the neck and head, acts in the same way, but with greater effect. Thus by the contraction of the left splenius, the face is turned to the left side, and the head is drawn back- wards and to the right side. The obliquus inferior also acts in the same di- rection. When the two splenii and the two inferior oblique act together, the head is inclined directly backwards. 4. The fixed insertions of the transverso-spinalis being at the articular or transverse processes, and their moveable points at the spinous processes, be- sides the common effect of erecting the vertebral column they are also able to rotate it, so that the anterior region of the trunk is turned to the opposite side. From its obliquity this muscle is the principal rotator of the vertebral column. The complexus, which is its representative in the neck, acts upon the head in the same manner, but in a more remarkable degree. Thus, by the contraction of the complexus of the left side, the face is turned to the right side, and the head is inclined backwards upon the left side, so that in rotation it acts in a precisely opposite direction to the splenius. When all these muscles act together the trunk is simply drawn erect. The superior oblique assists the complexus in the movements of the head. Lastly, we may now understand the successive actions which take place along the whole extent of the posterior spinal muscles. The sacrum and the iliac bones furnish a fulcrum for the fasciculi which move the lumbar region: this latter being fixed, then becomes the fulcrum for those that move the dorsal region, and so on to the head, which alone has independent muscles. It is im- possible to extend backwards the dorsal region, and the lower part of the cer- vical, without at the same time erecting the lumbar region; but the head may be moved at will, independently of the vertebral column. The posterior spinal muscles maintain in equilibrium the weight of the whole trunk; hence the lassitude experienced in the back, but especially in the loins, by long-continued standing, walking, or even sitting without a sup- port to the back; and hence the relief afforded by the recumbent posture. Rotation we have seen scarcely exists in the loins, the back, or the lower part of the neck; but at the upper part of the neck it is very extensive, and here the rotator muscles are proportionally strong, and directed very ob- liquely. MUSCLES OF THE ANTEBIOK ABDOMINAL REGION. The obliquus externus abdominis. — Obliquus internus and cremaster. — Trans- versalis abdominis. —Rectus abdominis. —Pyramidalis. The muscles of the anterior abdominal region are, the external oblique, the internal oblique, the transversalis, the rectus, and occasionally the pyramidalis; being ten in the whole, five on each side. The Obliquus Externus Abdominis. Dissection. 1. Make an incision through the skin of the abdomen extend- ing from the cartilage of the eighth rib obliquely downwards and inwards, dividing at the same time the very firm layer of cellular tissue, which imme diately covers the muscle. 2. During the preparation of this, as well as all the other abdominal muscles, place a block under the loms, and in the dissec- tion follow exactly the direction of the muscular fibres.269 THE OBLIQUUS EXTERNUS ABDOMINIS. The great or external oblique muscle of the abdomen (o, fiy. 106. and a. Jig. 109.), so called from the direction of its fibres (obliquus descendens, forms the most superficial muscular layer of the abdominal parietes, on the sides and front of which it is situated: it is very broad, quadrilateral, and curved upon itself. Attachments. It arises from the external surfaces and lower borders of the seven or eight inferior ribs, and is inserted into the an- terior half of the external lip of the crest of the ' ilium, into the external edge of the anterior ab- dominal aponeurosis, and by it into the linea alba. The upper or costal at- tachments consist of seven or eight angular tongues, or digitations, fleshy and tendinous in their struc- ture, and arranged in an oblique line, running downwards and back- wards. These digitations in- crease in size from above downwards as far as the eighth rib, and then dimi- nish to the twelfth. The four or five superior di- gitations are interposed, like the fingers of the two hands (whence the name), between similar prolonga- tions of the serratus mag- nus. The thi-ee or four- lower digitations between of the latissimus dorsi, by which they are covered. This series of costal attachments constituting the upper edge of the muscle, represents a serrated curved line, the convexity of which is directed upwards and back- wards. The first digitation is attached close to the cartilage of the corresponding rib, the succeeding ones are further and further removed from the first, and the last is inserted into the apex of the cartilage of the last rib. From these attachments the fleshy fibres proceed in different directions : the posterior pass nearly vertically downwards ; the middle obliquely downwards and inwards, and the upper almost horizontally inwards ; the posterior termi- nate by short tendinous fibres at the crest of the ilium; the anterior at the external concave edge of a broad aponeurosis, which forms the superficial layer of the anterior abdominal aponeurosis, and by interlacing with the cor- responding structure of the opposite side, concurs in forming the linea alba, and is folded upon itself below, to form the crural arch, or Poupart's ligament. (See Aponeurolooy.) It should be remarked, that the fibres of the external oblique follow exactly the same direction as those of the external intercostal muscles. thoseMYOLOGY. 270 Relations. The external oblique is covered by the skin, a considerable quantity of adipose tissue, and behind by a small portion of the latissimus dorsi. It covers the internal oblique, the anterior extremities and the carti- lages of the seven or eight inferior ribs, together with the corresponding ex- ternal intercostal muscles. The most remarkable relation is that of its poste- rior border with the outer edge of the latissimus dorsi. Most commonly this border is covered by the latissimus dorsi; but sometimes a triangular space exists between them, which has been much noticed since Petit described a hernial protrusion in it, which he called lumbar hernia. Action. The external oblique performs a threefold action:—1. It compresses the abdominal viscera during any exertion, or in expulsion of the faeces, in labour, &c: 2. it depresses the ribs, and thus indirectly flexes the vertebral column: 3. from its obliquity, it rotates the vertebral column, through the medium of the ribs, so that the fore part of the trunk is turned to the opposite side. When the two muscles act together, the thorax is inclined directly for- wards. Hitherto we have supposed that the moveable point of the muscle is at the ribs : if, on the contrary, the thorax be fixed, it then draws the pelvis upwards, and rotates the vertebral column, so that the fore part of the pelvis is turned to the same side as the contracting muscle. The Obliquus Internus, and the Cremaster. Dissection. Divide the external oblique across the direction of its fibres, I. e. downwards and backwards. The small or internal oblique of the abdomen (obliquus ascendens, 75, ^g'. 106. and a, fg. 110.) is abroad ir- regularly quadrilateral muscle, much broader in front than be- hind, and smaller and thinner than the preceding. It occupies the anterior, lateral, and pos- terior parts of the abdomen. Attachments. It arises from the spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrse, from the an- terior three fourths of the in- terval between the borders of the iliac crest, and from the crural arch (Poupart's liga- ments). It is inserted into the lower edges of the cartilages of the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, and into the linea alba by means of the middle layer of the anterior abdominal aponeurosis. The spinal fibres take their origin through the medium of the posterior ab- dominal aponeurosis: they are few in number. The iliac portion of them arise by very short tendinous fibres, and those which proceed from the crural arch arise from the sort of groove situated on its upper surface. From this threefold origin the fibres proceed in different directions; the pos- terior almost vertically up-THE TRANSVERSALIS ABDOMINIS. 271 wards; those which arise from the crest of the ilium obliquely upwards and inwards becoming longer and more oblique anteriorly; those which proceed Tm SaJ the anterior^uperior spinous process of the ilium are horizontal; and lastlv those which arise from the crural arch pass obUquely downwards and TnwLis Th7posterior fibres terminate at the lower edge of the car- tiCes If the four inferior ribs, and ai-e continuous with the internal intercostal Ses in tlfintervals between the tenth and eleventh and eleventh and twelfth X ScatinTthe analogy between these muscles.

It is covered by the external obhque and behind by a small portion of the latissimus dorsi; and it Ues superficially to the transversalis The most important relations are thore of its inferior edge, with the mguinal ring of the external oblique, which it partly closes on the mner side, as Scarpa and Bichat have weU pointed out, and with the spermatic cord, which passes beneath it, and during the descent of the testicle draws with it some of the lower fibres of the muscles ; and hence the looped arrangement they assume. The cremaster. The loops so weU described by M. Jules Cloquet are very variable, and do not always appear tome to constitute the entire muscle. Ac- cording to this anatomist, the cremaster is nothing more than the lower fibres of the internal oblique, that had been intangled with the testicle during its descent, forming loops in front of the cord, the concavity of which is di- rected upwards, and which may be traced to the bottom of the scrotum. But I have often been convinced, from the examination of subjects in which the cremaster was much developed, that this muscle (b, figs. 109.137.) consists prin- cipally of a longitudinal fasciculus, partly derived, it is true, from the lower fibres of the internal oblique, but consisting partly also of proper fibres arising fi-om the crural arch, near the external pillar of the ring ; and that this fas- ciculus is lost upon the proper sheath of the cord, to which it is intimately united. The ofiice of this muscle is to raise the entire testicle. The slow ver- micular motion ohserved in the scrotum during the venereal orgasm, or from the action of cold, is not at aU connected with it. The actions of the internal oblique are, 1. Compression of the abdominal vis- cera ; 2. Depression of the ribs, and consequently flexion of the trunk ; 3. Ro- tation of the trunk, so that the fore part of the body is turned to the same side. The right internal oblique, therefore, co-operates with the left external oblique; when it acts with its fellow, the thorax is drawn directly towards the pelvis ; but if the chest is fixed, they move the pelvis upon the loins. The Transversalis Abdominis. Dissection. Make a horizontal section of the internal oblique ; 2. Dissect with care the two flaps of this muscle, following the direction of the fibres of the transversalis; 3. In order to obtain a good view of the costal attach- ments, open the abdomen and examine them on the inner surface of the ribs this may be omitted until the diaphragm is to be inspected. The transversalis abdominis, so named from the direction of its fibres, is situated more deeply than the two preceding muscles, and like them is irre- gularly quadrilateral (,b,fig. 110.). Attachments. It arises from the six lower ribs, from the anterior three- fourths of the internal lip of the crest of the ilium, and from the spinous and transverse processes of the lumbar vertebra;. It is inserted into the linea alba by means of the deep layer of the anterior abdominal aponeurosis. The costal attachments consist of fleshy digitations interposed between those of the dia-MYOLOGY. 272 phragm, the two muscles being actuaUy continuous at the two inferior inter- costal spaces ; the vertebral attachments are effected by means of the posterior abdominal aponeurosis ; and from the ilium it arises by very short tendinous fibres mternally to the small oblique. From these three origins the fleshy fibres proceed parallel to each other and horizontally inwards; the lower ones alone are slightly inclined downwards and inwards; the middle fibres are the longest. They are all inserted into the external convex edge of a ten- dinous expansion, which constitutes the posterior layer of the auterior ab- dominal aponeurosis. Relations. The transversalis is covered by the internal oblique, and rests upon the peritoneum, from which it is separated by a fibrous lamina, which is very distinct in front, where it is named the fascia transversalis. Actions. 1. It acts more powerfully upon the abdominal viscera than any of the preceding muscles, compressing them strongly like a girth, against the vertebral column, and assisting greatly in the process of defacation. 2. It draws inwards the ribs to which it is attached, and thus materially assists in expiration. The Rectus Abdominis. Dissection. 1. The subject being laid upon its back, place a block under the loins; 2. After having removed the skin, make a vertical incision through the strong aponeurosis at about two fingers breadth from the linea alba; 3. Dissect off the two flaps inwards and outwards. The adhesions between tlds aponeu- rosis and the muscle ai-e, however, so intimate at many points, that it is impos- sible to separate them. The rectus abdominis {c,fig. 110.) is situated at the anterior and middle part of ihe abdomen on each side of the linea alba, and occupies the space between the pubes and the cartilage of the fifth rib. It is flattened like a riband in front and behind ; it is about three or four fingers' breadth wide above, and only two below. Its breadth is generally in an inverse proportion to its thickness. Attachments. It arises from the upper edge of the os pubis, in the space be- tween the spine and the symphysis ; and is inserted in front of and below the cartilage of the seventh rib and costo-xiphoid ligament, to the cartUages of the fifth and sixth ribs, and sometimes to the bone also. The pubic attachment is a flat tendon, consisting of two very distinct por- tions, of which the external is the larger. This tendon is continuous by its external border with the fascia transversalis. It is separated from its fellow of the opposite side by a very narrow and thick fibrous septum, which forms the lower part of the linea alba. Sometimes the internal tendinous fibres in- tersect with those of the opposite side in front of the symphysis pubes ; and some fleshy fibres often arise from the sides of the linea alba. The presence or absence of the pyramidalis affects the size of the lower part of this muscle. From this tendinous origin the fleshy fibres proceed vertically upwards (whence the name of rectus). At the upper part, where they are prolonged in an ex- panded form upon the thorax, they are slightly oblique from within outwards, and divided into three unequal portions : the internal, the smallest, is attached to the cartilage of the seventh rib and to the costo-xiphoid ligament; the middle, which is larger, is fixed to the cartilage of the sixth rib ; and the ex- ternal, by far the largest, to the cartilage of the fifth rib. Very often a small portion of the muscle is inserted into the base and edges of the xiphoid carti- lage, thus justifying the name of sterno-pubien given to it by Chaussier. It is not uncommon to find this muscle give off a fourth bundle to the fourth rib, and even an aponeurotic expansion to the sterno-cleido-mastoid. The rectus is interrupted by two, three, four, or five tendinous intersections, which pass transversely or obliquely across the muscle in a flexuous or zig-zag course, seldom occupying either the entire thickness or width of the muscle, which they divide into so many smaller muscles. There are always more intersections above than below the umbilicus.THE PYRAMIDALISo 273 Relaiinns. This muscle is contained in a very strong tendinous sheath, ■which is formed hy the anterior abdominal aponeurosis, is tliicker in front than behind, much stronger below than above, and completely isolates the muscle. Below and behind, this sheath is deficient, in which situation the muscle (passing through the openings, fig. 110., in the aponeurosis of the trans- versalis) rests directly upon the peritoneum; the upper and posterior part of the sheath is also wanting, so that the muscle is in immediate contact with the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs, and with the cor- responding intercostal muscles. The ILnea alba occupies the interval between the two muscles, which is much larger above than below the umbilicus ; but the most important of all the relations of the rectus is that of its posterior sur- face with the epigastric artery, which we shall hereafter notice./ Actions. This muscle, having its fixed point below, and its moveable at- tachments divided between the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs, depresses the whole thorax, and consequently the vertebral column. Few muscles are so favourably situated as the rectus, which both acts upon a very long lever, and is inserted at right angles to the part to be moved. As the rectus forms a curve, the convexity of which is directed forwards, and cannot contract without becoming rectilinear, it follows that the first effect of its contraction is the compression of the abdominal viscera; hence it assists in expelling the contents of the bladder, rectum, and uterus ; it aids in expiration, by depressing the ribs and by keeping them fixed, when the tho- rax is dilated, it assists in the performance of any effort. When the fixed point is above, the rectus becomes a flexor of the pelvis. What are the uses of the intersections ? It is generally stated that their efiect is to increase the number of fibres, and thereby augment the force of the muscle ; and in support of this a principle is adduced, which is incontes- tible in itself, viz. that the power of a muscle is in a direct ratio to the number of its fibres; for if each fibre represent one partial power, the more of these the greater must be the total power. But it has been overlooked, that this law only applies to fibres arranged side by side, not to those which are placed end to end. In fact, it may be experimentally shown, that when two equal forces are applied to a lever, parallel to each other, they produce double the efi'ect either would have done separately; but if one be made continuous with the other, and both are then applied to the same lever, they only producp an efi'ect equal to that of either per se. These intersections, therefore, do not in- crease the power of the muscle ; nor do they diminish the extent of motion, for the sum of the contractions of the small muscles into which they divide the recti, is equal to that of an undivided muscle. What then are the uses of these intersections? Can it be intended, as Bertin has said, to associate the oblique muscles with the recti, by means of the intimate adhesions existing between them and the aponeuroses ? * The Pyramidalis. The pyramidalis (d,fig. 110.), a small triangular muscle which is often de- ficient, occupies the lower part of the abdomen on each side of the linea alba. It arisesjTom the pubis and the anterior ligament of the symphysis by ten- dinous fibres from which the fleshy portion proceeds upwards, the mternal nbres vertically, the external obliquely upwards and inwards, and terminates Dy a pointed extremity which is attached to the linea alba, and forms the apex ot tue muscle, the base being at the os pubis.

The lower part of the rectus and the pyramidalis are united together. When the latter is wanting, the lower end of the rectus is proportionally increased in size, and vice versa.

Dissection. — IJescription. — Attachments. — Relations. — Action. Dissection. In order to expose this muscle, it is necessary to open the ab- domen and remove all the abdominal viscera, taking great care in detaching the liver, stomach, and kidneys. Tie the oesophagus and vena cava where they pass through the diaphragm, and cut them below the ligature. Raise the peritoneum with the fingers or forceps, and tear it gently away; thus ex- posing the lower surface of the muscle without using the scalpel. All the insertions of the diaphragm are well seen on this surface. In order to study the convex surface of the muscle, another subject should be provided, and the thorax opened before the abdomen. This is the only method by which a good idea of it can be obtained; for when the abdomen has been previously opened, the muscle becomes relaxed as soon as the thorax is cut into, and affords no idea of its naturally vaulted* form. The diaphragm (septumtransversum, aa,Jig.\\\.'), which exists mmammalia onlv, is, according to the expression of ■ " Hailer, with the exception of the heart, the most important muscle of the body. It is a muscular septum, situated obliquely -a, at the junction of the upper with the two lower thirds of the trunk. It separates the thorax from the abdomen, constitut- ing the floor of the former and the roof of the latter. AU other muscles are placed on the outside of, or around, the levers which they are intended to move; but the diaphragm alone is situated within those levers, like the muscles of animals having an external skeleton. The diaphragm divides the body into two unequal parts, an upper, or supra-dia- phragmatic, and a lower, or infra-dia- phragmatic. It is placed on the median line, but is not symmetrical. It is ellip- tical in form, its longest diameter bemg from side to side, thin and flattened, and resembles an arch, or rather a fan, the , broad and circular portion of which is ■ • .,1 whikt the narrow part is vertical, and at right angles to the former nonzontal, whilst tne nariow Pj^'^ . . portions ; the upper, or great The older anatomists, therefore, divided it diaphragm , muscle of the diaphragm, ^-^^'^^^ yi^lnZ^^ egion o^f the vertebr^ column, Attachments.

To these tendons two thick fleshy bundles succeed, which pass vertically upwards, become gradually thicker and broader, give oS a fasciculus to each other, and are inserted into the posterior notch in the aponeurosis, having the form of a trefoil leaf, which forms the centre of the muscle, and is therefore called the central aponeurosis of the diaphragm (J), fig. 111.), or cordiform tendon. These two fleshy bundles and their tendons (c, c), are named the pillars, crura, or appendices of the diaphragm. The right cms is anterior, larger, and descends lower down than the left. Each pillar is occasionally divided into two very distinct secondary pillars, and the trace of this division is always visible in the opening which gives passage to the great splanchnic nerve. The two pillars of the diaphragm leave between them an interval divided into two portions or rings, by the fleshy fasciculi which they mutually give to each other. The communicating fasciculus from the right pillar is anterior, and larger than that from the left. Of the two openings or rings between the pillars of the diaphragm, the lower or aortic (d) is para- bolic, and gives passage to the aorta, the vena azygos, the thoracic duct, and sometimes also to the left great sympathetic nerve. Like all orifices through which arteries pass, it is aponeurotic in its structure, being formed by the tendons of the pillars of the diaphragm at the sides, and above by a fibrous prolongation of those tendons which arches over and completes the ring: — the upper or oesophageal opening (e) gives passage to the oesophagus and the pneumo-gastric nerves ; it is elliptical, and altogether muscular. In one sub- ject, however, I found the upper part tendinous ; and in another a smaU mus- cular fasciculus proceeded from the edge of the orifice, and was lost upon the coats of the oesophagus. HaUer has twice observed the same peculiarity. A fibrous prolongation proceeds oiltwards from the tendon of each crus, and is fixed to the base of the corresponding transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra, so as to form an arch on each side (fig. 111.), under which the upper end of the psoas muscle passes (ligamentum arcuatum proprium). Another aponeurotic arch, which has been improperly called ligamentum arcuatum {ligament cintre du diaphragme), for it is nothing more than the upper edge of the anterior layer of the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle folded upon itself, extends from the outer extremity of the preceding arch to the lower border and apex of the last rib ; under it passes the superior portion of the quadratus lumborum muscle (^5". 111.). From both these arches, muscular fibres pass forwards, and are inserted into the corresponding part of the cordi- form tendon. Indeed, the five tendinous arches which we have just described, viz. the aortic in the middle, and the two on each side for the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles, give origin to all the fleshy fibres which ter- minate at the posterior notch of the central tendon of the diaphragm. The existence of these arches led Haller and Soemmering to reckon three or four crura on each side. The cordiform tendon in which the preceding muscular fibres are inserted, serves, in its turn, as the origin of other fibres which con- stitute the vault of the diaphragm. This central aponeurosis (6), to which so much importance was attached by the ancients under the name of the phrenic centre, and which some modern anatomists regard as the central point of the entire aponeurotic system of the human body, occupies the middle of the vault ol the diaphragm, immediately below the pericardium, with which its circum- terence is blended in adults, but from which it may be easily separated in young subjects : it is a sort of aponeurotic island, surrounded on all sides by muscular fibres, and converting the diaphragm into a true digastric muscle in torn. It resembles a trefoil leaf, with a notch in the situation of the pedicle- l^lt T^'^^ "^^^'^ ^ ""'"9' ^<^°fi^^: the middle leaflet is the largest, the & ^ ^"^^ smaUest. Between the right and thi middle vena cav.*° t??"*"? (/); sometimes converted into a canal for the inferior vena cava. This orifice is entirely tendinous, and of a quadrangular shape X w276 MYOLOGY. when the vena cava is removed. It is hounded by four tendinous fasciculi, which meet at right angles. The cordiform tendon is itself composed of several planes of fibres ; the principal of which consists of a diverging series running forwards, and uniting into irregular, straight, or curved bundles, which intersect each other at various angles; an arrangement that gives great strength to the tendon. The fleshy fibres are attached to all points of the cir- cumference of this tendon, and radiate from it in all directions. The anterior, very short, and sometimes aponeurotic, proceed to the base of the ensiform cartilage, describing a slight curve with the concavity directed downwards. A triangular interval, or else several small spaces, are often left between these fibres, establishing a communication between the cellular tissue of the thorax and that of the abdomen. Hence, diaphragmatic hemise occasionally occur; and pus, formed in the neck or mediastinum, may ultimately point at the epi- gastrium. It is not uncommon to find the sternal attachment of the diaphragm partially or entirely deficient. The lateral muscular fibres, which are much longer than the anterior, de- scribe very well-marked curves, and form an arch with the concavity down- wards, but more convex and projecting on the right than the left side. They then divide into six or seven digitations on each side, which are attached to the ribs, intersecting with the costal insertions of the transversalis abdominis. It is not uncommon to find considerable intervals between the digitations of this muscle, opposite which the pleura and peritoneum are in contact : this more especially occurs between the eleventh and twelfth ribs. The fasciculus for the twelfth rib is sometimes deficient, its place being occupied by a tendon. The direction of the fibres of the diaphragm is then radiated and curvilinear in the horizontal portion, but radiated and rectilinear in the vertical portion. Relations. 1. The inferior, or abdominal surface, concave in the middle, and much more concave on the right side, where it corresponds to the convex upper surface of the liver, than on the left, where it is in contact vnth the spleen and the large extremity of the stomach, is covered by the peritoneum through- out the greater part of its extent, excepting at the situation of the coronary ligament of the liver, and also behind, where it is in relation with the third portion of the duodenum, the pancreas, the kidneys, the supra-renal capsules, and the solar plexus. . 2 Thoracic, or upper surface. The middle portion is convex, and covered by the pleurjE and pericardium; it is flat, and serves as a floor to support the heart, the inferior surface of which rests upon it; hence the pulsations of the heart felt in the epigastrium. The lateral portions are convex, and contiguous to the lungs. The convexity is greater on the right than on the left side: the highest point to which the right side reaches in the natural condition is the level of the fourth rib; the highest point which the left side attams, is opposite the fifth rib. Hence the stu-gical rule of operating for empyema higher on the right than on the left side.* . , ., „t,„o The height to which the diaphragm is raised varies remarkably ; it reaches very much higher in the foetus than in the adult.

The two pillars act like the long muscles; the body of the diaphragm after the manner of the hollow muscles. Wlien the pillars contract, they take their fixed point upon the lumbar vertebrae, and their moveable point upon the notch at the back of the cordiform tendon, which is carried backwards and downwards. This apo- neurosis in its turn becomes a fixed point for aU the other curved radiated fibres that are attached to the ribs. The first eflfect of the contraction of a curved fibre is its becoming straight; and in this process the highest part of the curve is drawn down towards a level with its extremities: the vertical diameter of the thorax is therefore increased, and that of the abdomen propor- tionally diminished; but during contraction, the fibres act equally upon both their points of insertion, and as the cordiform tendon is fixed, and the costal attachments are moveable, the ribs are drawn inwards, and the transverse dia- meter of the thoracico-abdominal cavity thereby diminished. The antero- posterior diameter would be equally diminished, were it not for the inclination of the diaphragm downwards and backwards, in consequence of wliich the ab- dominal viscera are pressed downwards and forwards. Some experimentalists, among whom we may mention Haller and Fontana, have asserted that the diaphragm may become convex below during a forced contraction, but I believe this can only take place when air has been admitted into the cavity of the pleura "We shaU now consider the effects of the contraction of the diaphragm upon the openings by which it is perforated. The elliptical or rather oval opening for the oesophagus, being entirely muscular, is contracted during the action of the diaphragm, in the same manner as the mouth by that of the orbicularis muscle: hence the oesophagus is com- pressed. From this it has been concluded that vomiting cannot take place during inspiration, but experience proves the contrary, vomiting being fa- voured by this compression. It is generally said that the orifice for the vena cava is not affected by the contraction of the diaphragm; but if we draw upon the muscular fibres in the neighbourhood of this opening, we see at once that it is diminished in size ; Haller has even witnessed this in a living animal during inspiration. The arch, or rather the parabolic canal, which gives passage to the aorta, is also contracted, and the vessel slightly compressed; hence doubtless arises the trequency of aneurisms of this artery, where it passes through the pillars of the diaphragm.

The iliac portion Imes the iliac fossa; it is covered by the peritoneum, the cascum and the end of the smaU intestines on the right side, and by the sigmoid flexure of the colon on the left. These two muscles form a projection on the mside, which re- duces the transverse diameter of the brim of the pelvis from five inches to four and a half 3. The psoas and iUacus exactly fiU that portion of the crural arch in which they are placed, so that hemise never take place in this situa- tion. 4. In the thigh, the common tendon is separated anteriorly from the cel- lular tissue of the groin by the deep femoral fascia; it is in relation with the crural nei-ve which passes out of the pelvis in the same sheath as, but below, the psoas, in a groove between the latter and the iliacus, between which parts it forms the only separation. Behind, it is in contact with the anterior border of the OS coxEB and the hip-joint, a large bursa intervening, which often com- municates with the synovial capsule of the joint, by an opening of variable size.* The inner edge of the psoas-iliac muscle is in relation with the outer edge of the pectineus, and with the femoral artery, which it sometimes covers. The external edge is at first in relation with the sartorius, and afterwards with the rectus femoris. The psoas-iliac is also covered by the lumbo-iliac fascia (^fascia iliaca), which will be described hereafter. (Vide Aponeurology.) Actions. The psoas-iUac muscle flexes the thigh upon the pelvis; this action is the more energetic from the fact of the fixed points of insertion being both on the vertebral column, and on the iliac fossa. The two portions of the muscle do not act in the same direction; but when they contract simultaneously, the opposite forces are destroyed, and the traction upon the common tendon becomes direct. This muscle afibrds a remarkable example of the reflexion of a muscle over a pulley, which greatly increases the power, by changing the direction of insertion nearly to the perpendicular. The action of this muscle, therefore, must only be calculated from the point of reflexion, i. e. the anterior edge of the Uium. It is in semi-flexion that the muscle becomes perpendicular to the femur, and acts with the greatest power; and, therefore, the momentum of the muscle occurs at that period. The psoas-Uiac is at the same time a rotator outwards of the femur, on account of the obliquity of its insertion at the inner and back part of that bone. When the femur is fixed, as in standing, it draws the lumbar portion of the spine and the pelvis forwards ; and its iliac portion rotates the pelvis so as to turn the front to the opposite side. When the muscles of each side act together, the trunk is inclined directly forwards. The Psoas Parvus. This muscle (II, fig. 111.) lies in front of the preceding; it arises from the twelfth dorsal vertebra, the first and sometimes the second lumbar ver- tebrae, and the corresponding inter-vertebral substances. It forms a small flat bimdle, at first appearing to be a dependence of the psoas magnus, but soon becoming isolated; it terminates in a broad, shining tendon which crosses the psoas magnus at a very acute angle, and is inserted into the upper part of the ilio-jfectineal eminence, and the corresponding portion of the brim of the pelvis. This small muscle receives the lumbo-iliac apo- neurosis (fiscia iliaca), on its outer edge. It is often absent; we have sometimes seen it double. Its use is evidently to render the iliac fascia tense, and to tie down and prevent displacement of the lumbar portion of the psoas magnus. It may assist in flexing the pelvis upon the thorax, as in ciunbing; m the recumbent and supine position, if one muscle acts alone it inclines the pelvis to its own side ; but if its fixed point be below, it inclines the trunk to the same side.

Expose the posterior surface, by carefully detaching the common mass of the posterior spinal muscles ; and to view the anterior, open the abdomen and remove the viscera. This muscle is inclosed in a sheath formed by the anterior and middle layers of the posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis; divide this sheath, and the muscle will be completely laid bare. The quadratus lumborum (m m, fig. 111.) is quadrilateral in shape, and broader oelow than above ; it is situated in the lumbar region, on the sides of the ver- tebral column, between the crest of the ilium and the last rib. Attachments and direction. It arises from the ilio-lumbar ligament, and from about two inches of the adjacent part of the iliac crest, by aponeurotic fibres, which on the outer side especially are very long. These fibres are bound down by others, crossing them at right angles, and give origin to the fleshy part of the muscles, which proceeds upwards and a little inwards, in the following manner: — 1 Some of the fibres pass vertically upwards, and are inserted into the last rib, to an extent which varies in different individuals. 2. Others are directed very obliquely inwards, and divide into four fleshy bundles, inserted by means of a similar number of tendons into the summits of the transverse processes of the four superior lumbar vertebrae. 3. There is most commonly a third plane, anterior to the preceding, and consisting of fibres, which arise from the summits of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, and fifth lumbar vertebrae, and are inserted into the lower edge of the last rib. Connections. The quadratus lumborum somewhat resembles the rectus ab- dominis, in being inclosed and bound down in a very strong tendinous sheath ; it has therefore no direct relations. In front are the kidney, the colon, the psoas, and the diaphragm ; behind, is the common mass of the spinal muscles, beyond which its outer border somewhat projects, especially below. Its most important relations are with the kidney and the colon. It is the guide for the necessary incisions in operations performed in this region, particularly in nephrotomy. Action. With its fixed point at the crest of the ilium, this muscle depresses the last rib, by means of its costal insertions, thus acting as a muscle of ex- piration, and it inclines the spine to its own side, through the medium of its vertebral attachment. With its fixed point above, it inclines the pelvis to its own side. LATERAL VERTEBRAL REGION. The inter-transversales and rectus capitis lateralis. — Scaleni. The lateral muscles of the vertebral column are the inter-transversales of the neck and loins, the rectus capitis lateralis, and the scaleni. The quad- ratus lumborum already described belongs also to this region. *. The Inter-transversales and Rectus Capitis Lateralis. The inter-transversales muscles exist only in the neck and the loins ; in the back, they are represented by the intercostals, an additional proof of the analogy between the ribs and the cervical and lumbar transverse processes. Many celebrated anatomists, however, admit the existence of inter-transverse muscles in the back, but they are nothing more than deep-seated fasciculi of the transverso-spinalis. 1. Inter-transversales of the neck (o to o, fig. 112.). There are two of these muscles in each inter-transverse space, au anterior and a posterior. They are snuill quadi'ilateral muscles, one arising from the anterior, the other from281 THE SCALENI. the posterior mavgin of the groove on the transverse process below : from these origins the fibres proceed vertically upwards, and are inserted into the transverse process of the vertebra above. They are • / separated from each other by the anterior branches of "I^^^^S- the cervical nerves, and by the vertebral artery, the /^ffl™!^^ i ^^^^^ which they serve to complete. Behind, gBM^y^ they are in relation with the posterior spinal muscles, ^ilHiw splenius, the levator anguli scapulaj, the trans- versalis colli, and the cervicalis descendens; and in part with the rectus capitis anticus major. ^ 2. F.ectus capitis lateralis (6, fig. 112.). ^ This muscle may be regarded as the first posterior inter- trans versalis of the neck, and the rectus capitis anti- cus minor, which we shall presently describe as the first anterior inter-transversalis. The comparative size of the rectus lateralis is not opposed to this view, for it is connected with the increased developement of the corresponding cranial vertebra. It arises from the transverse process of the atlas, and proceeds directly upwards to be inserted into the jugular surface of the occipital bone, immediately behind the fossa of that name. This muscle separates the jugular vein, with -which it is in contact in front, from the vertebral artery to which it is contiguous behind. 3. Inter-transvei-salis of the loins. The absence of any groove upon the lumbar transverse processes would lead us at once to infer that in this region there must be only one muscle in each inter-transverse cpace. There are, therefore, five on each side. The first extends from the transverse process of the last dorsal to that of the first lumbar vertebra ; and the last from the transverse process of the fourth to that of the fifth lumbar vertebra. Action. These little muscles, by drawing the transverse processes towards each other, incline that portion of the vertebral column with which they arc connected towards their own side ; that is, the cervical muscles with the rectus lateralis incline the head and neck, and those of the lumbar region act upon the loins. The Scaleni. Dissection. These muscles are in a great measure displayed in the ordi- nary dissection of the anterior and posterior cei-vical regions. In order spe- cially to expose them upon an entire subject, it is sufficient to dissect off the skin on the sides of the neck, and to remove the omo-hyoid, the nerves the cellular tissue, and the sub-clavicular lymphatic glands. But in order to de- monstrate the inferior attachments of these muscles, the upper limb must be scarified by disarticulating the clavicle at its sternal end, or still better by sawing the clavicle through the middle, dividing the great and smaU pectoral muscles, raismg the sterno-cleido-mastoid, detaching the serratns maenus, and drawing the apex of the shoulder forcibly backwards. The scaleni occupy the sides and lower part of the neck, extending from the two upper ribs to the six lower cervical vertebrae, sometimes to the atlas also, ihey are, therefore, fasciculated like all the other vertebral muscles Anatomists are not agreed concerning their number. Albinus enumerated nve on each side; Sabatier reduced these to three; but we agree with M toZT' A anatomists, in admitting the existence of two only, an an- n HpLJ'k-'' P"'';^""^- M.

Attachments and direction. It arises from the inner margin and upper sur- face of the first rib near its middle, the point of attachment being indicated by a tubercle, with which it is highly important that we should be acquainted, be- cause it serves as a guide in placing a ligature upon the subclavian artery, which passes over the upper surface of the first rib. It arises by means of a tendon that expands into an aponeurotic cone, from the interior of which the fleshy fibres take their origin. These unite, form the body of the muscle, and proceed upwards and inwards, to be inserted by so many separate tendons into the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the sixth, fifth, fourth, and third cervical vertebrse, and more especially into the notches be- tween the two tubercles at the extremities of these processes. It is not un- common to find one or two fasciculi inserted into the posterior tubercles. Relations. In front and on the outside this muscle is in relation with the clavicle, from which it is separated by the subclavian muscle and vein ; higher up with the sterno-mastoid, the omo-hyoid, the phrenic nerve, and the trans- verse and ascending cervical arteries. Behind, it is separated from the poste- rior scalenus by a triangular space, which is wide below to receive the sub- clavian artery, and narrow above, where it corresponds to the brachial plexus of nerves, by the first two branches of which the muscle is sometimes perfor- ated. On the inside it is separated from the vertebral artery by the longus colli. The relations of the scalenus anticus to the subclavian vein and artery are of the highest importance to the surgeon, and in order to impress them upon the memory I propose to designate it the muscle of the subclavian artery. 1 have seen both the artery and vein placed in front of this muscle. The scalenus posticus {d,figs. 112, 113, and 114.) may be termed the poste- rior long inter-transversalis colli. It is situated behind the preceding muscle, is of the same shape, but somewhat larger. Attachments and direction. It has two perfectly distinct origins; one. ante- rior and larger, from all that part of the first rib intervening between the de- pression for the subclavian artery and the tubercle ; and another, posterior, from the upper edge of the second rib. The latter attachment is sometmies wanting. Proceeding from this double origin, the fleshy fibres form two smaU muscular bodies, which either remain distinct, or become blended to- gether, and pass upwards and inwards, to be inserted by six separate tendons into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the six mfenor cer- vical vertebrEB. It is not uncommon to find a fasciculus extendmg from the second rib to the atlas. _ . .t. v i • „^„v„ Relations. It is separated from the anterior scalenus by the subclavian artery and brachial plexus ; and is in relation, behind, with the cervicahs descendens, transversalis colli, splenius, and levator anguU scapulae : on the outside, with the serratus magnus, the transverse cervical artery, and the sterno-mastoideus: on the inside, with the flrst intercostal, the first rib, the inter-transversales of the neck, and the cervical vertebrae. ■ a a Action The scaleni are powerful flexors of the neck, when their fixed points are below; but when their upper attachments are fixed, they tend to elevate the first rib, and in a slight degree the second also.

AU this will be rendered apparent from the following de cription. Dissection. Remove the face and aU the parts which cover the cervical portion of the spine by the vertical section, caUed the section of the pharynx because it is also employed in demonstrating that part In order to separate the face from the cranium, remove the roof of the skull by a horizontal section, and then make a vertical cut either from above or from below; if we cut from above, we may adopt the usual plan of directing the saw transversely so as to emerge immediately in front of the auditory meatus : in doing this, however, we are in danger of injuring the superior attachments of the recti, or ot cut- ting into the pharynx. We prefer, therefore, the foUowing method : make two sections with the saw obliquely forwards and inwards m the course of the occipito-mastoid and petro-occipital sutures, and having arrived at the basilar process, cut it across with a chisel, a Uttle in front of the anterior condyloid foramina. In separating the face from the cranium from below upwards, a great number of muscles must be scarified : the preceding section is therefore preferable, although it is somewhat more difficult. The Rectus Capitis Anticus Major. This muscle (e,figs. 112. and 114.), the transverso-spinalis anterior (rectus capitis internus major. Alb.'), is the most external of those in the prevertebral region. Attachments and direction. It arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the sixth, fifth, fourth, and third cervical vertebrae, by small tendons to which as many fleshy fasciculi succeed; these pass obliquely upwards and inwards, overlying and blending with each other, and terminate on the posterior surface and edges of a shining aponeurosis, that occupies almost entirely the anterior aspect of the muscle. This aponeurosis itself be- comes a surface of origin, dividing into two laminae, from the borders of and interval between which a fleshy bundle ascends, to be inserted into the basilar process in front of the foramen magnum. The fasciculus arising from the third cervical vertebra does not join the common insertion, but is attached directly and in a very distinct manner to the basilar process within and behind the common fasciculus. The muscle must be turned outwards, in order to display this structure. Relations. It is covered by the pharynx, the internal carotid artery and jugular vein, the superior cervical ganglion and trunk of the great sympathetic nerve, and the par vagum, being separated from all these parts by some loose cellular tissue and the prevertebral aponeurosis. It covers the corresponding vertebree, the articulation of the occipital bone with the atlas, and that of the atlas with the axis, a portion of the longus colli, and also of the rectus minor. Tlie Rectus Capitis Anticus Minor. This muscle (/, fig. 112.), the inter-transversalis anterior (rectus capitis in- ternus minor, Alh.'), extends from the base of the transverse process and from the adjacent part of the lateral mass of the atlas, to the basilar process of the occipital bone. It is partially covered by the rectus major, which is nearer the mesial plane: the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic rests upon It, and it covers the atloido-occipital articulation. It may be regarded as an anterior inter-transversalis between the occipital bone and the atlas, the rectus laterahs constituting the posterior inter-transversalis.MYOLOGY. 284 The Longus Colli, Attachments, direction, and relations. The longus colli (^g g, figs. 112. and 114.) as before stated, is composed of three very distinct sets of fasciculi: 1. the transverso-spinalis, -which, arising by flat tendons from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the fifth, fourth, and third cervical vertebrse, unite so as to form a considerable fleshy bundle directed upwards and inwards, occupy the hollow on each side of the median line of the axis, and are inserted into the anterior tubercle of the atlas, which may be regarded as the repre- sentative of an anterior spinous process; 2. The anterior spino-transversalis, the least numerous of all, arise from the bodies of the three superior dorsal vertebras by very slight tendinous expansions, proceed upwards and outwards, and are inserted into the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the fourth and third cervical vertebrae; 3. The spinalis which arise, to the inner side of the preceding fasciculi, from the bodies of the three upper dorsal and four lower cervical vertebrae, and from the intermediate ligaments, and having described a slight curve, are inserted into the crest of the axis, and into the third cervical vertebra. The longus coUi is elongated and fusiform in shape; it supports the pharynx, the cesophagus, the internal carotid artery, the in- ternal jugular vein, and the pneumogastric and great sympathetic nerves : it covers the vertebrae to which it is attached. Action of the Muscles of the deep Anterior Cervical Region. When the head is thrown back, these muscles restore it to its original posi- tion. The rectus anticus major tends to flex the head, and from its obliquity to rotate it, so as to turn the face to its own side. The rectus minor incUnes the head to its own side. The longus colli flexes the atlas upon the axis, and rotates it so as to turn the face to its own side. The same muscle also rotates the lower part of the neck, so as to turn the face to the opposite side; and, lastly, it is a direct flexor of the cervical region. THORACIC REGION. The pectoralis major. — Pectoralis minor. — Subclavius. — Serratus magnus. — intercostales. — Supra-costales. — Infra-costales. — Triangularis stemi. The Pectoralis Major. Dissection. Separate the arm from the side. Make a horizontal incision from the top of the sternum to the front of the arm on a level with the lower border of the axilla, including iu this incision a fascia, which adheres closely to the fleshy fibres. Reflect one of the flaps upwards and the other downwards, by dissecting parallel to the fibres, i. e. transversely to the axis of the body. The pectoralis major (c c,fig. 109.), is a broad thick triangular muscle, situ- ated at the upper and fore part of the thorax and axilla. It arises from the anterior border of the clavicle and anterior surface of the sternum, from the cartilages of the second, third, fourth, and more particularly those of the fifth and sixth ribs, from the osseous portion of the last mentioned rib, and from the abdominal aponeurosis: it is inserted into the anterior margin of the bicipital groove of the hiunerus. The clavicular origin consists of short tendinous fibres attached to the entire breadth of the anterior border of the clavicle, for about the inferior third, or half of its extent. The sternal attachment consists of aponeurotic fibres, which, mtersectmg with those of the opposite muscle, form, in front of the sternum, a very thick fibrous layer, sometimes ahnost completely covered by the muscular fibres, which, m certain individuals, advance nearly to the median line. The costal origins consist of very thin tendinous laminEB, and the attachment to the abdominal aponeurosis is blended with that of the rectus abdominis.THE PECTORALIS MAJOR. 285 From these different origins the fleshy fibres proceed outwards in different directions; the upper fibres obliquely downwards, the middle transversely, and the lower fibres obUquelij. These last are folded backwards, so as to form a sort of groove, which embraces the lower border of the pectoralis minor. It appears, then, that the pectoralis major is composed of three very distinct por- tions, which are sometimes separated by a greater or less quantity of cellular tissue. These three portions in converging are so disposed, that the upper overlaps the middle, and this again the lower portion, the fibres of which are twisted upon themselves, so that the lowest in front become the highest behind, and vice versa.* They are all inserted into the anterior lip of the bicipital groove by means of a flat tendon, about fifteen lines in breadth, which is continuous with the anterior edge of the tendon of the deltoid. The stnicture of this tendon commands particular attention, and can only be examined after having divided the muscle across, and turned the external half outwards. It will then be seen that it is composed of two laminae, placed one before the other, sometimes blended together, but generally distinct, or united only by their lower edges, so that they form a groove opening upwards. The anterior lamina is the thicker, and receives the clavicular and middle portions of the muscle; the deep layer affords attachment to the lower portion. It is not uncommon to find the two lamina; separated by the tendon of the long head of the biceps, the groove for which they then contribute to form. The entire tendon is broader and thicker below than above, and gives off, both forwards and back- wards, an aponeurotic expansion, constituting one of the chief origins of the fascia of the arm.f Relations. It is covered by the platysma myoides, the mammary gland, and the skin. Its deep relations are of the greatest importance. On the thorax, it covers the sternum, the ribs and their cartilages, the pectoralis minor, the subclavius nauscle, the serratus magnus, and the intercostals. It forms the anterior wall of the axilla, and is in relation with the brachial plexus and axillary vessels, and with the cellular tissue and lymphatic glands of that re- gion. Its external border is nearly parallel to the anterior edge of the deltoid, being separated from the latter by a linear or triangular cellular interval, in which are situated the cephalic vein and acromial artery. Its lower border is thin towards the median line, thick and tendinous externally ; it forms the anterior border of the axilla, and gives rise to a projection under the skin, proportionate to the developement of the muscle. Its inner border intersects in the median line with the muscle of the opposite side, and is continuous below with the linea alba. Uses. The pectoralis major is essentially an adductor of the arm; at the same time It rotates it mwards, and draws it forwards. It is by the action of this muscle that the forearms are crossed, and that one hand is placed on the oddo- °, u^^":. ^*'/PP\^ clavicular portion conspires with the anterior fibres of the deltoid and with the coraco-brachiahs in elevating the humerus and carrying it forwards. If the arm be at a moderate distance from the side and its lower extremity be fixed, as is the case in faUmg on the elbow when the arm is directed outwards this muscle acts upon the humerus as upon a lever of the third order, of which he fulcrum is below, the power in the middle, and the resistance above, and t hen tends to dislocate the head of the humerus with great force, because^n this position Its insertion IS perpendicular to the lever «^<tuse in When the humerus is fixed, the pectoralis major acts upon the ribs, the distinct, and terminate in i .sm^^ll flnX,^ 'l'*' Pectoralis ma;or, from which it was perfectlv tendon 'was continued along Th" innfr^sidT^^fihot^i'TdrAll^r'fL"^ °^ muscll."

It is therefore one of the chief agents in climbing. Its action upon the ribs renders it an im- portant auxiliary in cases of laborious inspiration. Hence the attitude of an asthmatic patient, -who always places himself so as to keep the humeri fixed. The Pectoralis Minor Dissection. Detach the clavicular insertion of the pectoralis major, and divide that muscle in the middle by a vertical incision; reflect the two flaps, taking care to remove, at the same time, the loose cellular tissue which invests its deep surface. The pectoralis minor (e,fig. 110.) is a thin, flat, triangular muscle, having its internal edge serrated (serratus anticus, Alhinus"), and occupying the anterior and upper part of the thorax and shoulder. It arises from the third, fourth, and fifth ribs by three delicate, shining, tendinous prolongations, lying super- ficially to the intercostal muscles; to these succeed three fleshy fasciculi, which unite and converge, so as to be inserted by a flat tendon into the anterior margin of the coracoid process near its summit. Relations. It is covered by the pectoralis major, from which it is separated by the thoracic vessels and nerves: its posterior surface is in relation with the ribs, the intercostal muscles, the serratus magnus, the cavity of the axilla, and therefore with the axillary vessels and nerves. This last relation is of great importance, and sometimes renders the section of this muscle necessary for the ligature of the axillary artery. Attention should also be directed, 1. to its upper border, which is separated from the clavicle by a triangular interval, broad on the inside and narrow on the outside, in which the same artery may be tied; and 2. the lower border of the muscle extends downwards beyond the pectoralis major. Action. Most commonly it acts upon the scapula (musculus qui scapulam antrorsum agit, Vesalius). With its fixed point at the ribs, it evidently draws the scapula forwards and downwards, and forcibly depresses the apex of the shoulder. As a depressor of the shoulder, it acts in conjunction with the levator anguli scapuliE and rhomboideus, but antagonises those muscles considered as elevators of the entire scapula: it is also opposed to the rhomboideus when moving the scapula forwards. With its fixed point at the scapula, this muscle elevates the ribs to which it is attached. The Subclavius. Dissection. Raise the clavicle by carrying the apex of the shoulder upwards; divide the pectoralis minor, and remove the fibrous membrane, descendmg from the clavicle, and immediately investing the muscle. In order to expose its external or clavicular insertion, saw through the clavicle m the middle; divide the muscle at the same point, and reflect the external half with the correspond- insr portion of the clavicle. j ♦„ The subclavius {g,fig. 110.) is a long, thm, fusiform muscle, apphed to the lower surface of the clavicle, by which it is concealed (musculus qui sub cir^cula occultatur, Fabricius Hildanm). It arises from the cartdage of the Srib, and is inserted into the inferior and external surface of t^e cla^acle Its costal attachment consists of a cervical tendon, from which the fleshy fibres proceed outwards, backwards, and upwards, and are mserted mto the ''"iS^Sls '^TLTowr^raW by the clavicle, which is grooved beneath forTHE SERRATUS MAGNUS. 287 compression to which these parts would have been otherwise exposed between ''!4£''mtn1tsSd"point is at the first rib it depresses the clavicle, and ■JZ^lrrXressor o/the shoulder; it tends ^Iso to p^^^^^^^^^ the clavicle forcibly against the sternum; so, also, ^.^^^^^''^^ ^^^^^^^ it occasions the external fragment to "^e upon the in ernal.

Having removed the two pectorals, saw through the clavicle at its middle; press the scapula backwards, directmg its axillary edge outwards remove with care the ceUular tissue occupying the axilla especiaUy that against the axillary vessels and nerves, and near the costal attachments ot the muscle itself, in order to see the internal surface of which the subject must be turned, and the vertebral costa of the scapula drawn outwards. The serratus magnus («, fig. 106., d, 109., and /, 110.), very broad, quadri- lateral, and serrated along one of its borders, occupies the side of the thorax, and extends like a muscular girth from the ten upper ribs to the vertebral costa of the scapula. Its costal attachments consist of nine or ten digitations arranged in a curve, having its concavity directed backwards. The first digitation, which is very large, arises both from the first and second ribs, and from an aponeu- rotic arch between them; from thence the fibres proceed upwards, outwards, and backwards, and are inserted into the inner surface of the posterior and superior angle of the scapula, near the levator anguli. This digitation is the narrowest part of the muscle ; it differs in direction from the remainder, and is separated from them by a cellular interval; hence it has been termed the superior portion of the serratus magnus. The second, third, and fourth digita- tions arise in an oblique line, running downwards and forwards from the second, third, and fourth ribs. These are the largest and the thinnest of all the digitations; they proceed horizontally backward, and are inserted separately by short tendinous fibres into the entire length of the vertebral costa of the scapula, anterior to the rhomboid; they are distinguished from the remaining digitations both by their direction, and by an intervening cellular space ; they form the middle portion of the serratus magnus. The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth digitations arise from the outer surface of the corresponding ribs along oblique lines, resembling the fingers crossed, and are interposed between corresponding prolongations of the external oblique. These digitations are at first tendinous, they soon become fleshy, and converging towards each other form a radiated fasciculus, which passes upwards, outwards, and backwards, to be inserted into the internal sur- face of the inferior angle of the scapula. This is the inferior portion of the serratus magnus. Relations. The serratus magnus is partially covered by the two pectorals before, by the subscapularis behind, and above by the axillary vessels and nerves; its deep surface rests upon the ribs and the intercostal spaces, all these parts being united by a quantity of loose cellular tissue. A considerable portion of the lower part of the muscle is subcutaneous, and therefore the inferior digitations are important studies for the painter and the sculptor, and sometimes even for the surgeon, as indications of the arrangement of the cor- responding ribs. Action. From the disposition of its difi'erent fasciculi, the serratus magnus occasions a compound movement of the scapula, which it will be well to ana- lyse. The upper portion depresses and brings forwards the apex of the shoul- der ; the middle portion draws the entire scapula directly forwards; whilst the lower portion depresses it, and moreover rotates it, so that the apex of the shoulder is carried upwards. As the lower part of the muscle is composed ofMYOLOGY. SIX or seven of the converging fasciculi, which act with greater energy than the others, it follows that their action predominates even when the whole muscle contracts. The serratus raagnus is then a depressor of the entire shoul- der and an elevator of its apex. It is more especially concerned than any other muscle in supporting a burden upon the shoulder. In order that the action of the serratus may be directed upon the scapula, its costal attachments must be fixed: this requires the simultaneous contraction of the oblique muscles of the abdomen to maintain the ribs in a depressed posi- tion, and of the diaphragm and transversalis to prevent their projection out- wards. This simultaneous contraction occurs during all great efforts. When the fixed point of the serratus magnus is at the scapula, its upper portion becomes a muscle of inspiration, its middle one of exspiration, and its lower one of inspiration. The greater power of the latter has been the cause of the antagonising action of the middle portion being overlooked; and the serratus magnus is, with great justice, regarded as the most powerful accessory muscle of inspiration : hence the various attitudes of asthmatic persons, who instinctively take a position which fixes the scapula, either by seizing a cord suspended from the top of the bed, or by bending forwards, and leaning on their elbows and forearms, or by resting their upper extremities on two lateral supports. The Inter-eostales, Externi and Interni; the Supra-costales and the Infra-costales. Dissection. In order to examine the external intercostals, and the supra- costales (levatores costarum), the scapula and all the muscles which cover the thorax must be removed ; to expose the internal inter-costales and the infra- costales, it is necessary to saw through the middle of the dorsal vertebrae and the sternum in a vertical direction, and to tear off the pleura from one side of the thorax, which may be very easily accomplished by the fingers. The intercostal muscles, as their name implies, occupy the intervals betveen the ribs: there are two in each intercostal space, and therefore as many pairs as there are spaces. They are divided into external and internal. They represent two very thin muscular layers, of exactly the same width as the spaces to which they be- long ; taken together, they also occupy the entire length of those spaces, but not separately, for the external intercostals extend only from the costo-verte- bral articulations to the commencement of the cartilages of the ribs, while the internal intercostals commence at the angles of the ribs behind, and extend forwards to the stermmi. A very thin aponeurosis is prolonged from the free margin of the one forwards and of the other backwards to the end of the in- tercostal space. The external muscles, which I have generally found thicker than the internal, arise from the lip of the groove on the lower border of one rib, and the internal from the inner lip of the same groove, as well as from the corresponding costal cartilage ; they are both inserted into the upper border of the rib below. The superior attachments consist of fleshy and ten- dinous fibres and lamellse, all of which proceed downwards to the rib below ; those of the external layer obliquely forwards, and those of the internal layer much less obliquely backwards. The inferior attachments are similar in structure The tendinous fibres of the intercostal muscles are very long, and much more numerous than the fleshy fibres: hence the intercostal spaces possess considerable strength, to which the crossing of the two layers also ^^^Behtions The external intercostals are covered by the two pectorals, the serratus magnus, the serrati postici, the latissimus dorsi, the sacro-lumbahs, and the external oblique ; they are superficial to the internal intercostals, and are separated from them by the intercostal vessels and nerves and by a very thin fibrous layer. The internal intercostals are covered by the external andTHE TRIANGULARIS STERNI. 289 by the aponeurotic layer continuous with them anteriorly. Internally they are in relation with the pleura, which from the angles to the tuberosities of the ribs is in apposition with the external muscles. The infracostal muscles of Verheyen consist of small muscular and apo- neurotic tongues, variable in number and length, which extend from the inner surface of one rib to the inner surface of the next, and sometimes also to the second or third rib below. They are sometimes vertical, but often oblique, like the internal intercostals, of which they may be regarded as portions. Supra-costales (levatores breviores costarum of Albinus, o to o, fig. 107.). These are small triangular muscles, situated at the back part of the intercostal spaces. They are accessories of the external intercostals, resemble them in being half tendinous and half fleshy, and appear to form a continuation of them. There are twelve on either side. Each arises from the summit of the transverse process of a vertebra, and proceeds in a radiated manner down- wards, to be inserted into the back part of the upper border and external sur- face of the rib below. The fibres of these muscles have the same direction as those of the external intercostals, but they are more oblique, especially on the outside. The first arises from the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, the last from that of the eleventh dorsal. Some of these muscles have two digitations, one disposed in the ordinary manner, the other attached to the next rib below. The latter, called the long supracostals (levatores longiores, Albinus and Holler'), form a transition between the levatores breviores and the serrati. Morgagni met with all the levatores united together, so as to form a very regular ser- rated muscle. They are covered by the longissimus dorsi and sacro-lumbalis, and they cover the external intercostals. Action. The contraction of the intercostal muscles tends to approximate the ribs ; and according as the upper or the lower ribs are fixed, they act as muscles of inspiration or of expiration. It has never been denied that the external intercostals are muscles of inspiration, but the crossing of the two muscular layers has given rise to the opinion that they oppose each other in action ; and hence arose the celebrated dispute between Hamberger and Haller. It is easy to understand that the slight difference existing between their attach- ments, with regard to their distance from the fulcrum, could not counter- balance the effect of a difference in the relative fixedness of the ribs, and that the intercrossing of these muscles has no other object than to increase the strength of the parietes of the thorax. As the first rib is much more fixed than the last, it follows that it must serve as a fixed point for the first intercostal muscle, which will consequently raise the second rib ; this wiU then become the fixed point for the third riK and so on. The scaleni often take their fixed point upon the vertebraj and then assist in elevating the first rib. The quadratus lumborum depresses the last rib, wnich may then serve as a fixed poiut for the others during expir- The levatores act very effectuaUy in raising the ribs; for being attached so near to the fulcrum, the slightest movement produced in the posterior ex- tremity of the rib becomes very sensible at the other end. I agree with Bo- reui {De Motu Animal, tom. ii. p. 158.) that the intercostals act even during the most easy respiration. This can be observed upon our own persons, and also in in(bviduals in deep sleep. The ribs will be seen distinctly carried out- wards, and the sternum raised.

Like them it is serrated. It arises from the sides of the posterior surface of the sternum from the ensiform cartilage and the inner ends of the cartilages of the ribs. From this origin the fleshy fibres proceed, dividing into three, four, five, and sometimes six digitations, which are inserted by tendinous fibres into the posterior surface and borders of the sixth, fifth, fourth, third, sometimes of the second, and even of the first costal cartilages. The lower fibres pass horizontally and parallel to the upper fibres of the transversalis with which they are continuous. The succeeding fibres are directed upwards and outwards, proceeding more and more obliquely up- wards : hence the triangular shape of the muscle, to which its name refers. Relations. It is covered by the sternum, the internal intercostal muscles, and the costal cartilages, from which it is separated by the mammary vessels and some lymphatic glands; it is lined internally by the pleura, and rests upon the diaphragm below. . v i. • • _* i Its use is evidently to depress the costal cartilages mto which it is inserted, or to oppose their elevation. Remarks concerning the intercostal muscles. The muscles we have just de- scribed viz. the intercostals and their accessories, are essential elements in the construction of the chest; they are found in all animals possessed of a thorax Their use is to dilate and contract this cavity m its antero-posterior and transverse diameters. The first rib, being fixed by the contraction of the scaleni, serves as a fulcrum for the agents of inspiration; and the last nb, when fixed by the quadratus lumborum, serves the same purpose for those ot ex- piration; so that these muscles, whose most common action 15 to inchne to one side the neck.and the loins, do not, on that account, act the less upon the ribs. I cannot, by any means, agree with Winslow, who demes that the scaleni have Ly action upo/the ribs ^and maintains that the articulation of the with the first dorsal vertebra, is intended for the movement of the vertebra on the rib, not for that of the rib on the vertebra.

The posterior fibres,-which are lost upon the skin of the face, are the rudiments of a remarkable fasciculus, an accessory of the platysma, found in some subjects. It is directed obliquely downwards from the region of the parotid gland to the angle of the lips. San- torini described it under the name of risorius novus. Relatims. These two muscles occupy the whole anterior region of the neck, excepting the median line, where they leave a triangular interval, having its base below, and occupied by a very dense fibrous tissue, forming a species of raphe, which is found in the median line throughout the body. This is the linea alba of the neck, from which the different component layers of the cervical fascia take their origin. The platysma is intimately connected with the skin, but it does not adhere equally throughout; it is united closely below, but much more loosely above, where the intervening cellular tissue is always adipose, and capable of con- taining a large quantity of fat, as we find in individuals who have what is called a double chin. There are no lymphatic glands between this muscle and the skin; they are all situated beneath the muscle. The relations of the deep surface of the platysma are very numerous. It covers the supra and sub- hyoid, and the supra-clavicular regions, being separated from all the structures beneath it by the cervical fascia, to which it is united by loose cellular tissue, seldom containing any fat. If we examine these relations in detail, we find, proceeding from below upwards, that it covers, 1. the clavicle, the pectoralis major, and the deltoid; 2. In the neck, the external jugular vein, and also the anterior jugulars where they exist, the superficial cervical plexus, the sterno- mastoid, the omo-hyoid, the sterno- or cleido-hyoid, the digastric, and the mylo-hyoid muscles, the sub-maxiUary gland, and the lymphatic glands at the base of the jaw. In front of the sterno-mastoid, it covers the common carotid artery, the internal jugular vein and the pneumogastric nerve; behind the stemo-mastoid, it covers the scaleni muscles, the nerves of the brachial plexus, and some of the lower nerves of the cervical plexus. 3. In the face, it covers the external maxillary or facial artery, the masseter, and buccinator muscles, the parotid gland, &c. Action. The platysma is the most distinctly marked vestige in the human body of the panniculus carnosus of animals; and it can produce slight wrinkles in the skin of the neck. Its anterior border, especially at its inser- tion near the symphysis menti, is the thickest part of the muscle, and therefore projects slightly during its contraction. It is one of the depressors of the lower jaw; it also depresses the lower lip, and slightly the commissure of the lips. It therefore assists in the expression of melancholy feelings, but It IS antagonised by the accessory portion, which draws the angle of the lips upwards and a little outwards, and thus concurs in the expression of pleasur- able emotions; hence its name, risorius.

The sternal origin consists of a tendon prolonged for a considerahle distance in front of the fleshy fihres. The clavicular origin consists of very distinct parallel ten- dinous fihres, attached to the inner side of the anterior edge, and upper surface of the clavicle, to a very variable extent, an important fact in surgical anatomy. There is often a considerable cellular interval be- tween these two origins: sometimes ■d this interval scarcely exists, but in all cases the two portions of the muscle can be readily separated. From this double origin the fleshy fibres proceed, forming two large bundles which remain distinct for some time. Many anatomists there- fore, Albinus in particular, have considered it as consisting of two separate muscles, which they de- scribe as the sterno-mastoid, and the cleido-mastoid; a division that is sanctioned by the comparative ana- tomy of this muscle. The sternal portion of the muscle is the larger, and passes upwards and outwards; the clavicular portion proceeds al- most vertically upwards, behind the other, and is entirely concealed by it at the middle of the neck; the two portions still remain separate, although approximated; ultimately they be- come united, and are inserted into the apex and anterior sui-lace of the mastoid process by a very strong tendon, which runs for some distance along the anterior border of the muscle, and also into the two external thirds ot the superior semicircular line of the occipital bone, by a thm aponeurosis, ibe direction or axis of the sterno-mastoid passes obliquely upwards, backwards, and outwards. ^ /. • i The relations of this muscle are very important. Its superficial or external surface is covered by the skin and platysma, from which it is separated by the external iugular vein, and the branches of nerves, constituting what is im- properly termed the Superficial cervical plexus. Its deep or f^r f surface covers —1. the sterno-clavicular articulation; 2. aU the muscles of the sub- hyoid region, and also the splenius,the levator anguli scapulae, the digastricus and theialeni; 3. the accessory nerve of Willis, which crosses ^fneath its sunerior third, the pneumo-gastric nerve, the great sympathetic, the loop ot hrhypoglossal nerve, and the cervical nerves ; 4. the mternal iYZ^'Z' 5 the lower portion of the common carotid artery.

Their action is particidarly manifested in an attempt to raise the head while lying upon the back. Still there is a position in which this muscle may become an extensor of the head, viz. when it is thrown very far backwards; and this effect is owing to the nature of the upper insertion, which is situated somewhat behind the fulcrum of the lever represented by the head. This muscle affords one of the most remarkable examples of the co-opera- tion or simultaneous action of several muscles, in order to give effect to the action of one. Thus, in order that the stemo-cleido-mastoid may act most advantageously upon the head, it becomes necessary that the sternum being the fixed point, should be maintained as immoveable as possible, and this can only be effected by the contraction of the recti muscles of the abdomen. These latter in their turn require a fixed point at the pelvis, and this renders necessary the contraction of the glutaji, the serai-tendinosus, the semi-mem- branosus, and biceps femoris on either side ; and lastly, for the action of these, the legs require to be fixed by means of their extensor muscles. This remarkable simultaneous .contraction of so many muscles, necessary for the action of but one, has been extremely well illustrated by Winslow. It has many important results both in physiology and in pathology. MUSCLES OF THE INFRA-HTOID REGION. The sterno-hyoideus. — Scapula- or omo-hyoideus. — Sterno-thyroideus. — Thyro-hyoideus. The muscles of the infra-hyoid region are four in number on each side, viz. the sterno- or rather cleido-hyoid; the omo-hyoid; and the sterno-thyroid, which is continuous above with the fourth muscle, viz. the thyro-hyoid. The Sterno-hyoideus. Dissection. This is extremely easy, and is the same for aU the muscles of this region. The only caution necessary is that the clavicular and sternal attachments of these muscles should be studied from their posterior aspect only, and that the trapezius must be removed in order to expose the scapular attachments of the omo-hyoid, The sterno-hyoid (1< figs- 113 and 114.) is a flat, thin, ribbon-like muscle, which is sometimes double on each side. It arises from the inner end of the clavicle, and is inserted into the os-hyoides. Its inferior attachment is liable to some variations; most commonly it is connected with the back part of the inner extremity of the clavicle and with the inter-articular cartilage; some- times with the outer side of that extremity ; and sometimes with the circum- ference of the clavicular surface of the sternum. From this origin the fleshy fibres proceed parallel to each other, upwards and inwards, to be inserted by short tendinous fibres into the lower edge of the body of the os hyoides on the side of the median line and to the inside of the omo-hyoid, wiih which it is often blended. Immediately above the clavicle this muscle is often divided by an aponeurotic mtersection, which is united to that of the opposite side and forms, as It were, a transverse bridle. Relations. It is covered by the platysma, the sterno-mastoid, and the cervical tascia It covers the deep-seated muscles, the thyroid body, the crico-thyroid ana thyro-hyoid membranes, from which it is often separated by a bursa mu- cosa, the crico-thyroid muscle, and the superior thyroid artery. The inner cages ot the two sterno-hyoid muscles are generally separated by a fibrous rapfte, but they are sometimes blended together; and thus render the operation 01 tracheotomy more difficult. This impediment may, however, be overcome by keepmg accurately in the median line.MYOLOGY. 294 The Scapulo- or Omo-Ihjoideus This muscle Ccoraco-hjoideus, AUnnus; m m. Jigs. 113. and 114.) is longer and more slender than the preceding; it is a digastric reflected muscle, com- posed of two small fleshy bellies, united by an intermediate tendon. It arises from the superior border of the scapula behind the coracoid notch, over an ex- tent varying from a few lines to an inch, and is inserted into the lower part of the body of the os hyoides, externally to the sterno-hy oid. From its origin, which is sometimes tendinous, it proceeds for a variable distance behind and parallel to the clavicle, and is then reflected upwards and inwards, at an obtuse angle. At the point of reflection it becomes entirely or partially tendinous; and gives origin to another fleshy bundle larger than the former, which is inserted into the os-hyoides. The angular direction of this muscle is maintained by means of an aponeu- rosis, first described by Soemmering, which extends between the inner borders of the two muscles, and is fixed to the clavicle: it is one of the layers of the cervical fascia, an important structure to be again alluded to hereafter, and of which the omo-hyoid muscles are tensors.' These muscles are occasionally warrting; sometimes they are double. In one case of this kind the accessory muscle was larger than the normal one, and arose from the upper and internal angle of the scapula. Relations. This small muscle, before reaching the sub-hyoid region, traverses two others, the supra-clavicular and the sterno-mastoid. It is covered by the trapezius, the subclavius, the clavicle, the platysma, the sterno-mastoid, and the skin ; it covers the scaleni, the brachial plexus, the internal jugular vein, and the common carotid artery, and it is in contact with the outer border of the sterno-hyoid muscle. Tlie Sterno-thyroideus. The sterno-thyroid (n,fig. 114.) closely corresponds with the sterno-hyoid, from which it differs only in being shorter and broader. It extends from the posterior surface of the sternum to the thyroid cartilage. It arises from the sternum opposite the first rib; it is often blended with its fellow, so that their origins form a line reaching the entire breadth of the sternum, and often to the edges and posterior surface of the cartilage of the first rib. From this origin the fleshy fibres proceed directly upwards parallel to each other, and are inserted into the thyroid cartilage by a tendinous arch running obliquely downwards and inwards, which embraces the thyro-hyoid muscle, and is attached by its extremities to two very prominent tubercles on the ex- ternal surface of the cartilage. It is sometimes continued as far as the os hyoides by a small lateral prolongation, and at other times it is continuous with the thyro-hyoid. The sterno-thyroid is interrupted by a tendinous m- tersection analogous to those of the rectus abdominis. It is not uncommon to find the two sterno-thyroid muscles united together by an intervening apo- neurosis shaped like the letter V, opening upwards, and corresponding to the fourchette of the sternum. , ., , , • ■, , j Relations It is covered by the stemo-hyoid and omo-hyoid muscles, and it covers the trachea, the lower part of the subclavian and internal jugular veins, the common carotid artery, and the arteria innommata on the right side, the thvroid body and the thyroid vessels. The middle thyroid vein runs along its inner border, an important relation in regard to the operation of tracheotomy. The Thyro-hyoideus.

It is covered by the two muscles of the superficial layer, and covers the thyroid cartilage, and the thyro-hyoid membrane. Action of the muscles of the suh-hjoid region. These muscles are the most simple, both in structure and in action: they aU concur in depressmg the lower jaw; but if the lower jaw is fixed they produce flexion of the head. The fixed points of aU are below, viz. at the sternum on the mside, at the clavicle in the middle, and at the scapula on the outside. This arrangement not only bestows particular uses upon each, but renders the common action ot all more certain. Thus, the omo-hyoid at the same time that it depresses the OS hyoides, carries it backwards and towards its own side. Where the two omo-hyoid muscles act together, the os hyoides is directly depressed, and torced backwards against the vertebral column. The sterno-hyoid and the sterno- thyroid prolonged by the thyro-hyoid, draw the os hyoides directly downwards. The principal use of the thyro-hyoid is to move the os hyoides upon the thyroid cartilage, in which movements the upper part of the cartilage is carried behind the os hyoides, the curve described by which is always greater than that formed by the cartilage. The muscles of the sub-hyoid region never assume as their moveable points either their sternal, clavicular, or scapular at- tachments. MUSCLES OF THE SUPRA-HYOID REGION.

It is in some respects the type of di- gastric muscles. It is curved upon itself, form- ing the arc of a circle, with the concavity di- rected upwards. It arises from the di- gastric groove in the mastoid process, and from the anterior edge of that I)rocess, in front of the sterno-mastoid ; it is inserted into the side of the sym-296 MYOLOGY. physis menti, below the sub-mental tubercles, into the whole extent of the di- gastric fossa. It is also attached to the os hyoides by means of an aponeurotic expansion. ^ Its origin from the mastoid process is partly fleshy, and partly tendinous, the tendon being prolonged for some distance upon the upper border of the muscle. The fusiform fleshy belly produced in this manner passes forwards, inwards, and downwards, into the interior of a sort of fibrous cone, forming the commencement of the intermediate tendon. This tendon, which is about two inches in length, follows at first the direction xjf the muscle, almost always perforates the stylo-hyoid muscle, and is then received into a fibrous ring attached to the os hyoides, and lined by a synovial capsule. This fibrous ring is often wanting. A broad aponeurotic expansion proceeds from the inter- mediate tendon and is fixed to the os hyoides. When this is united to the corresponding structure on the opposite side, they form a very strong, trian- gular aponeurosis, called the supra-hyoid aponeurosis, which occupies the in- terval between the. two muscles, and serves as a kind of floor for the other muscles of the supra-hyoid region. After having passed through the fibrous ring, the tendon changes its direction, and is reflected at an obtuse angle up- wards and forwards, to terminate in another tendinous cone. From the interior of this cone the fleshy fibres of the anterior belly take their origin. This belly is not so strong as the posterior, and is inserted by separate tendons, some- times intersecting those of the opposite side, into the whole extent of the digastric fossa, below the sub-mental tubercles. Some fibres are often blended with those of the mylo-hyoid. It is not uncommon to see a smaU fascicidus arising from the os hyoides, and strengthening the anterior belly. The two anterior bellies are sometimes united by a raphe, and by a small transverse fibrous bundle. Relations. It is covered by the platysraa and stemo-mastoid, the parotid and the submaxillary glands, the latter of which it embraces by the concavity of its upper border: it covers the muscles which arise from the styloid process, the mylo-hyoid muscle, the internal jugular vein, the external carotid artery, and its labial and lingual branches, the internal carotid, and the hypo-glossal nerve, which lies parallel with and beneath the intermediate tendon of the muscle. Its action is very complicated: when the posterior belly contracts alone, the OS hyoides is carried backwards and upwards; the anterior belly carries it forwards and also upwards. When the two bodies of the muscle contract at the same time, these opposite effects are destroyed, and the os hyoides is carried directly upwards. In all these motions, the lower jaw must be fixed. If the os hyoides is fixed, the posterior belly becomes a depressor of the jaw, on account of the reflection of the muscle; the anterior and the posterior bellies can incline the head backwards, but this inclination of the head backwards during mastication, and when the jaws are separated, depends on the action of the posterior extensor muscles of the neck: lastly, the anterior belly of the digastric is the tensor of the supra-hyoid fascia The Stylo-hyoideus. Dissection. Detach the posterior belly of the digastric. This is a small and very thin muscle (g', ^Jfs. 114.;? q,figs. 143 and 147.) like all those which are attached to the styloid process. » It arises from the back of the styloid process, at a short distance from the apex, and opposite the insertion of the stylo-maxillary ligament. This origin consists of a small tendon, which terminates in a fibrous cone, from the interior of which the fleshy fibres commence. These proceed downwards, forwards, and inwards, and form a bundle which is almost always perforated by the tendon of the digastric. Occasionally the fibres pass only in front of that297 THE GENIO-HYOTDEUS. tendon. They are inserted into the body of the os hyoides, at a short distance from the median line. Sometimes the tendon of insertion is reflected upon itself, and forms the pulley for the digastric. _ , , , Relations. It is covered by the posterior belly of the digastric, and has the same relations as that muscle. It is not uncommon to find a second stylo- hyoid muscle, extending from the styloid process to the little cornu of the os hyoides. This muscle takes the place of the stylo-maxillary ligament; it was described by Santorini under the name of the stylo-hyoideus novus, and was noticed also by Albinus.* The Mylo-hyoideus. Dissection. Detach the anterior belly of the digastric at its maxiUary in- sertion ; dissect the submaxillary gland, and turn it outwards. This muscle (r,figs. 113 and 114.) situated immediately below, i.e. deeper (as regards the surface) than the anterior belly of the digastric, is thin and quadrilateral. It arises from the whole extent of the mylo-hyoid line, from opposite the last molar to the symphysis menti, by short aponeurotic fibres. The fleshy fibres arising from these pass in different directions: the internal (or anterior), very short, proceed inwards to a median fibrous raphe, which traverses the whole supra-hyoid region ; the external (or posterior) pass much less obliquely to the upper part of the body of the os hyoides. The median raphe is sometimes wanting, and the muscular fibres of the opposite sides are continuous with each other. Some of the fibres are often lost in the digastric, and are even continuous with the sterno-hyoid. The two mylo-hyoid muscles may, with great propriety, be regarded as a single muscle, divided by a ten- dinous intersection in the median line, Relations. It is covered by the anterior belly of the digastric, the supra- hyoid fascia, the platysma, and the sub-maxillary gland; and it covers the genio-hyoid, the hyo-glossus, and stylo-glossus muscles, the lingual and hypo-glossal nerves, the Whartonian duct, the sublingual gland, and the buc- cal mucous membrane. The Genio-hyoideus. This muscle (s,fig. 114, 143, 147.) is situated below, i.e. deeper than the preceding, which must be divided very carefully in order to avoid raising the two together It is a small, round, fleshy bundle, described by anatomists as consisting of two very minute muscles, separated from each other by an ex- tremely delicate cellular tissue. Sometimes it is impossible to separate them ; at other times the two bimdles are very distinct. They arise from the in- ferior sub-mental tubercle, and proceed downwards and backwards to be inserted into the upper part of the os hyoides. Relations. They are covered by the mylo-hyoids, and cover the hyo- glossal muscles. Actions of the Muscles of the Supra-hyoid Region. These are of two kinds, relating to the depression of the lower jaw and to the elevation of the os hyoides. The OS hyoides being fixed by the muscles of the sub-hyoid region, aU the supra-hyoid muscles, with the exception of the stylo-hyoids, depress the lower jaw ; and it should be observed that they are situated in the most favourable manner for this purpose; for, on the one hand, they are almost perpendicular to the lever and, on the other, they are attached as far as possible from the mcrum. Ihe obliquity of their direction has also this advantage, that the lower jaw is earned backwards as well as depressed, and thus the orifice of the mouth IS greatly increased in size. oi me * Albinus termed it styla-hyoideus alter.298 MYOLOGY. But the most important action of these muscles relates to the elevation of the OS hyoides. This elevation is an indispensable element in the act of deglutition, and also in the protrusion of the tongue. Thus the os hyoides is carried up- wards and backwards by the stylo-hyoid muscles and by the posterior belly of the digastric, upwards and forwards by the anterior belly of the digastric and by the mylo- and genio-hyoids, and directly upwards by the combined action of all these muscles. The base of the tongue, of which the os hyoides constitutes, in some degree, the framework, is associated with it in all these movements, which take place at different periods of deglutition : thus the move- ment upwards and forwards is effected during the period when the alimentary mass is driven from the cavity of the mouth into the pharynx, which enlarges for its reception. The direct elevation takes place when the mass is passing, and the movement upwards and backwards occurs after it has passed, so as to prevent its return into the mouth. "When the lower jawis fixed against the upper, and the os hyoides is also fixed by the sub-hyoid muscles, the muscles of the supra-hyoid region assist in flexing the head. Lastly, the os hyoides is elevated during the production of acute, and depressed during that of grave, vocal tones. MUSCLES OF THE CRANIAL REGION. Occipito-frontalis. — Auricular muscles. The muscles of the cranial region are the occipito-frontalis and the auricular muscles. The Occipito-frontalis. Dissection. Shave the head, and make a horizontal incision above the super- ciliary arch; make a second incision in a vertical direction from before back- wards, and reaching from the former to the superior semicircular line of the occipital bone ; be very careful not to dissect away the epicranial aponeurosis, nor the fibres of the muscle; commence the dissection at the fleshy fibres, which adhere less intimately to the skin than the aponeurosis. The occipito-frontalis (epicranius, ^/5inM«,a'a'.^jf. 113.) is sometimes re- garded as one muscle with two bellies; sometimes as a combination of two separate muscles, the occipital and the frontal. It covers the roof of the skull. We shall describe the occipital and frontal portions only; the aponeurosis will be elsewhere noticed. (Vide Aponeurology.) 1. The occipital portion, or occipital muscle, covers a great part of the occi- pital bone, and is situated over the superior occipital protuberance. It is thin and quadrilateral. It arises from the two external thirds of the superior semi- circular line, and from the neighbouring part of the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and is inserted into the posterior border of the cranial aponeu- rosis, of which it may be regarded as the tensor. The occipital attachment is composed of tendinous fibres; the fleshy fibres proceeding from which pass upwards in a parallel direction, and, after a short course, terminate in the aponeurosis. 2. The frontal portion, or frontal muscle, is placed at the front of the cranium ; it is thin, and irregularly quadrilateral like the preceding It is attached above to the cranial aponeurosis, and terminates below in the following manner: — 1 The internal or median fibres are prolonged into a fleshy band, which con- stitutes the pyramidalis nasi; 2. the fibres next on the outside are continuous with those of another muscle, viz. the levator labii superioris ateque nasi—to the outside of these fibres, the muscle is attached to the internal orbital pro- cess • 3 the greater number of the fibres are blended with those of the orbi- cularis palpebrarum. The upper border of the muscle, which is attached to the aponeurosis, forms a semicircular line, that, in many individuals, causes a pro- iection under the skin. .i „ Relations. The occipito-frontalis covers the roof of the skull; hence the name of epicranius {Albinus). It rests upon the pericranium (the periosteumTHE AURICULAR MUSCLES. 299 of the cranial bones), being separated from it by a quantity of moist cellular tissue, which admits of a considerable degree of mobility of the integuments, and is so elastic that it returns to its original situation after being displaced by any movements of the hairy scalp. The superficial surface of this muscle is covered by the skin, and is united to it by a very dense, almost fibrous cel- lular tissue, in which are ramified the numerous vessels and nerves of the cranial integuments. ... Action. The occipital portion is a tensor of the epicranial aponeurosis, which when stretched affords a fixed point for the frontal portion. This latter raises the upper half of the orbicularis palpebrarum, elevates the eye- brows and the skin over the root of the nose, and has a great effect m the ex- pression of emotions of delight. This muscle produces the transverse wrinkles on the forehead, which give to the countenance of individuals who are habitually gay, a peculiar expression, that is often imitated by painters. These transverse wrinkles do not extend over the triangular interval, which separates the two fleshy bellies of the muscle in the centre of the forehead. The occipito-frontalis must be regarded as an elevator of the upper eyelids ; it is blended with the orbicularis palpebrarum in the same manner as the labial muscles with the orbicularis oris. In this respect the occipito-frontalis is assisted by the levator palpebrse superioris, and antagonised by the corru- gator supercilii and orbicularis palpebrarum. Can this muscle erect the hairs on the head ? It is certain that it can move the entire hairy scalp, for many individuals are able tc do this at wiU; but it appears to me that the ex- pression, the hairs stand on end, as regards man, is merely figurative, and is derived from what occurs in the lower animals, in which this erection of the hair is very manifest. Perhaps, however, the skin itself may produce this effect by the same mechanism as that which gives rise to goose skin. The Auricular Muscles. Dissection. Be very careful in dissecting the superior and anterior auri- cular muscles, which are extremely thin, and consist only of a few colourless fibres. To render them as tense and prominent as possible, it is necessary to draw the ear away from the muscle to be examined. All these muscles are rudimentary in man, in whom the external ear is almost immoveable. They may all be considered as dilators of the audi- tory meatus, to which there is no constrictor or sphincter in the human sub- ject : certain animals, however, possessing a very delicate sense of hearing, have constrictor muscles, which draw together and move the different pieces forming the cartilaginous portion of this canal. The auricular muscles are three in number: a superior, an anterior, and a posterior. TTie Auricularis Superior. This muscle, which is extremely thin and of a triangular form (h',fig. 113.), occupies the temporal fossa. It arises from the external border of the epicra- nial aponeurosis, of which it seems to be a dependence ; from this origin its fibres converge, and are inserted into the upper part of the concha. It is covered by the skin, and lies upon the temporal fascia. Action. To raise the ear (attollens auriculam, Albinus). The Auricularis Anterior. .'^^isj^^scle {c',fig. 113.) is still thinner and less marked than the preceding, with which It is continuous. It is also triangular, and arises from the outer edge of the occipito-frontalis, and the cellular tissue covering the zygomatic "^f^i!" V r converge from their origin, and are inserted into the front ot the helix. It is covered by the skin, and lies upon the temporal fascia trom which it is separated by the temporal artery and vein. Albims)' ''"^^ auricle forwards and upwards (anterior auriculfc.300 MYOLOGY. The Aiiricularis Posterior. This muscle (d', fig. 113.) is much more decidedly marked than the pi e- ceding, and is composed of two or three distinct fleshy fasciculi (tres retrahentes auriculam, Albinus), which extend from the base of the mastoid process, and sometimes also from the occipital bone, to the lower part of the concha. Action. To draw the auricle backwards. MUSCLES OF THE FACE. All the muscles of the face are arranged in groups around its several openings, and may be classed either as dilators or constrictors. The nostrils alone have no constrictors. The eyelids must be opened and closed entire, without the production of any folds ; the nostrUs must remain constantly open, for the skin around these orifices has within it a corresponding lamina of cartUage, which gives it the necessary tension, strength, and elasticity, and into which the muscles are in- serted. There is no such arrangement at the orifice of the mouth, the muscles being there inserted into other muscles. From the three openings around which the muscles of the face are grouped, these may be arranged into three distinct regions, viz. the palpebral, the nasal, and the buccal. Muscles of the Palpebral Eegion. Orbicularis palpebrarum. — Superciliaris. — Levator palpebrce superioris. The muscles of the eyelids are divided into constrictors and dilators. There is one constrictor, viz. the orbicularis palpebrarum, to which the corrugator supercilii is an accessory ; there is also one elevator, viz. the levator palpebrsE superioris. The Orbicularis Palpebrarum. Dissection. Make an elliptical incision through the skin round the base of the orbit; dissect successively the upper and lower half of the muscle, pro- ceeding from the adherent towards the free border of each eyelid. It is of more importance here, than in any other situation, to dissect the skin parallel to the fleshy fibres. When the external surface of the muscle has been studied, detach it carefully from the subjacent parts, and reflect it inwards. The orbicularis palpebrarum le',Jig. 113.) forms an elliptical zone of variable size round the eyelids, and also an extremely thin layer upon them. It is a sphincter, and, like all muscles of this kind, is composed of circular fibres; but, as a special exception, it is also provided with a remarkable tendon of origin, named the straight tendon of the orbicularis: this isabouttwo lines in length, and half a line in breadth, arises from the ascending process of the superior maxilla, anteriorly to the lachrymal groove, and passes in front of the lachrymal sac, where it divides into two imequal parts, an upper and smaller, and a lower more capacious; sometimes it corresponds entirely to the upper part of the sac. At first It is flattened from before backwards, but is then twisted upon itself, so as to present one surface upwards and another downwards. Opposite the inner ano-le of the eyelids, this tendon, which is also called the palpebral ligament, becomes°bifurcated, and each division is attached to the inner end of the cor- responding tarsal cartilage; from the posterior surface of the tendon a very strong aponeurotic lamina is given off. and forms the outer wall of the lachry ma sac - this is the reflected tendon of the orbiadans palpebrarum. Fleshy fibres proceed from the Interior and posterior surfaces, and from the borders ot the straight endon, and also from the anterior border of the reflected tendon ; but the Ser number arise by well-marked tendinous prolongations from he exteS orbital process of the frontal bone, from the ascending process of theTHE SUPERCILIARIS. 301 superior maxilla, and fiom the internal and loTver third of the base of the orbit. Fron/the^e origins the fleshy fi^^^^ pass outwards, dividing into two halves, an upoer, which describes concentric curves with the ^"/'f ^l^y'^^^.^f^'^^J^;:.^- wards, and a lower also describing concentric curves but with concavity directed upwards (duo palpebrarum musculi, Vesahus). Each of these halves fs subdivided into two sets of fibres, an external set surrounding the base of the orbit, and an internal or palpebral belonging to each eyelid: hence the distinction drawn by Riolanus between the orbicular,., and the oj ^"'; pebraUs muscles. The external fibres (formmg the orbicukr portion) describe a complete ellipse. I have never met with the fibrous intersection at the outer part of the eye, mentioned by some anatomists The palpebral or ciliary fibres, forming the proper palpebral portion, arise from the bifurcation of the tendon, and describe concentric arcs, which are united on the outside at an acute angle to a cellular raphe. _ , , . , e Relations. The orbicular portion is closely united to the skm by means ot a fibrous and adipose tissue, which is very compact over the upper, and loose over the lower, portion of the muscle ; it is connected with the skin of the eye- lids by a serous cellular tissue, remarkably susceptible of infiltration. It covers the lachrymal sac, the corrugator supercilii muscle, the orbital arch, the maxillary bone, the temporal muscle, and the superior attachments of the zygomaticus major, of the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, and of the levator labii supe- rioris. It is separated from the conjunctiva by a fibrous membrane and the tarsal cartilages. Its circumference is blended with the pyramidalis nasi on the inside, with the occipito-frontalis and corrugator above, but is free below; occasionally it gives off a few fibres from its outer border, some of which form the zygomaticus minor, and others of a paler colour terminate in the skin Actions. The orbicularis acts in the same manner as all other sphincters, that is to say, the circular fibres, of which it is composed, contract towards the centre ; but as the fleshy fibres have their fixed point at the straight tendon, and still more at the internal insertions, it follows that during the contraction of this muscle it is thrown in some measure inwards, and by it the integu- ments of the forehead, the temple, and the cheek, are drawn towards the inner angle of the eye. The intimate adhesion between the skin and the upper half of the muscle explains why, during its contraction, that part is rendered more apparent beneath the skin than the lower. The palpebral portion contracts independently of the orbicular, a fact that confirms the distinction made by Riolanus. Nor is this all; the contraction of this palpebral portion, or palpe- bralis muscle properly so called, is habitually involuntary, whilst the contraction of the orbicular portion is subject to the will. The palpebral fibres are pale, and resemble the muscular fibres of the alimentary organs *; the orbicular fibres are red, like those of the muscles of animal life. When the palpebral fibres contract, they do not produce the occlusion of the eye, by a concentric ap- proximation of the fibres, but by bringing together the free edges of the eye- lids, the only method permitted by the tarsal cartilages. The curve described by the muscular fibres of the lower being smaller than that formed by those of the upper eyelid, it follows that the closing of the eyes depends principally upon the latter. The Superciliaris. Dissection. Make a vertical incision in the median line between the frontal muscles; tiu-n back carefully the frontal and the orbicularis muscles from within outwards. The superciliarii (corrugator supercilii, Albinus, a', fig. 114.), is a narrow and tolerably thick fasciculus, generally of a deeper red than the orbicularis, and situated along the superciliary arch, with the direction of which it corre- » See note *, p. 309.302 MYOLOGY. spends. It arises by one, often by two or three portions from the internal portion of this arch; proceeds upwards and outwards, describiDg a slight curve, having its concavity downwards, and is blended with the orbicularis palpe- brarum at about the middle of the arch of the orbit. From this arrangement Albinus described it as a root of the orbicularis. According to some authors it terminates in the skin of the eyebrow (cutaneo-surcilier, Dumas); but I have always found it attached to the deep layer of the orbicularis muscle. Relations. It is covered by the pyramidalis nasi, the orbicularis palpebrarum, and the occipito-frontalis, and it covers the os frontis, the supra-orbital and frontal arteries, and the frontal branch of the ophthalmic nerve. Action. This muscle corrugates the eyebrow, and draws it downwards and inwards. It is, therefore, regarded as the principal agent in the expression of grief. The repeated contraction of these muscles in irascible individuals gives a character of severity to the countenance, from the constant approximation of the eyebrows, and the permanence of the vertical wrinkles formed between them. The Levator Palpebra Superioris. Dissection. Remove the roof of the orbit by two cuts with a saw, meeting at an acute angle opposite the foramen opticum ; detach the bone with care, so as to leave the periosteum untouched; cut the periosteum from before back- wards, and separate the frontal nerve which passes above and parallel to the muscle, which may then be separated carefully from the superior rectus muscle of the eye. The levator palpebrce superioris (see description of the eyelids) is an elongated, flat, triangular, and very thin muscle, placed in the orbital cavity, directed horizontally from behind forwards, and curved at its anterior extreniity, so as to form a concavity directed downwards. It arises from the inferior sur- face of the lesser wing of the sphenoid, immediately above the optic foramen, and from the sheath of the optic nerve, and is inserted into the upper border of the tarsal cartilage. Its sphenoidal origin consists of a small tendon, and its attachment to the sheath of the optic nerve is a fibrous ring common to all the muscles of the eye. From these points the fleshy fibres proceed for- wards forming a broad thin bundle, increasing in width and dimimshmg in thickness towards its tarsal insertion, which is effected by means of a broad ^^°ReMiom. Covered by the periosteum of the orbit, from which it is separated by the frontal branch of the ophthahnic nerve, covered also by some adipose tissue and by the fibrous membrane of the upper eyelid, it covers the superior rectus of the eye and the conjunctiva. , , v r Action. It raises the upper evelid. Its reflection over the globe of the eye explains that pecuUar motion of the eyelid by which its upper edge is buried below the orbital arch. The relaxation of this muscle suffices for the de- pression of the upper eyeUd in passive closure of the eyes, while the active occlusion depends on the contraction of the orbicularis. There is no analogous muscle for the lower eyehd, which scarcely concurs either in opening or shutting the eyes. NASAL REGION. The pyramidalis nasi.--Levator lahii superioris alaque vasi. - Transversalis, or triangularis, nasi. - Depressor alee na^i. - JSaso-lahialxs. rr„^ r«„<:plP« of this region are the pyramidaUs nasi, the levator labu su- ^er"i;L" S transversahJL triangulaxis nasi, the depressor ala. nasi, or myrtiformis, and the naso-labialis of Albinus.

The pymmidalis nasi {f, fig. 113.) is a prolongation of the internal fibres oftheoccipito-frontaHs, of which it may be regarded as a prolongation (fron- talis pars per dorsum nasi ducta, Eustachvis). It Ues upon the bridge of he nose on each side of the median line. It is separated from the muscle of the opposite side by a thin layer of ceUular tissue It is narrower at its origm than at its termination, which takes place m the aponeurosis of the transverse muscle of the nose. n _ •„!! Relations. It is covered by the skin, to which it closely adheres, especially below, and it covers the nasal bones and lateral cartilages. ^ , , Action. This smaU muscle has been regarded as an elevator of the ala, and consequently a dilator of the nose; but I beUeve it rather acts in depressing the inner angle of the eyebrow, and the skin between the eyebrows. In this respect it has considerable influence upon the expression of the countenance. The Levator Labii Superioris Alceque Nasi. Dissection. Make a vertical or somewhat oblique incision from the ascending process of the superior maxilla to the upper lip. Reflect outwards the inner and lower part of the orbicularis muscle. This muscle {g',fig. 113.) is thin, triangular, and divided into two portions below. It extends from the ascending process of the superior maxiUa to the ala of the nose and the upper lip. It arises by a narrow extremity from the internal orbital process of the frontal bone, immediately below the tendon of the orbicularis palpebrarum, passes obliquely downwards and outwards, be- comes much broader, and is inserted partly into the cartilage of the ala of the nose, or rather into the very dense skin which covers it, and partly into the orbicularis oris, or rather into the skin of the upper lip. The cutaneous portion of this muscle is distinguished by its paleness, compared with the red colour of the rest. Relations. It is covered by the skin, and a small portion of the orbicularis palpebrarum; and it covers the ascending process of the superior maxilla, and the transverse muscle of the nose. Action. It elevates both the ala of the nose and the upper lip. I consider it the most important of aU the muscles of the nose, because the elevation of the alsB dilates the nostrils, and thus aids most essentially in cases of impeded respiration. It is a respiratory muscle of the face, and has also great influence over the countenance, producing the expression of contempt. Its action upon the upper lip is of much less importance than that upon the nose. The 2\ansversalis, or Triangularis, Nasi. Dissection. Remove with great care the skin covering the ala of the nose, and then follow this muscle below the inner edge of the common elevator; or, what is better, remove all the soft parts covering the ala of the nose, and dissect the muscle from its deep surface. The transversalis nasi (compressor narium, h', figs. 113, 114.), which I regard as a dependence of the muscle next to be described, is a small and very thin triangular muscle, stretching from the inner part of the canine fossa to the bridge of the nose. It arises by a narrow extremity from the canine fossa, passes forwards, enlarging as it proceeds along the ala of the nose, and ter- mmates by a very thin aponeurosis, which is blended in the median line with that of the opposite side, and with the pyramidalis. It is covered by the skin, to which it closely adheres, and by the common elevator; and it covers the cartilage of the ala, and a small part of the superior lateral cartilage of the nose. Action. The action of this small muscle is not yet well determined. Some have agi-eed with Riolanus in considering it a dilator (qui alam naris dilatatMYOLOGY. 304 sine elevatione nasi, Riolanus); others think with Spigelius and Albiuus that it is a constrictor of the nose (primi paris constringentium alas, Spigelius; compressor naris, Albinus). It is probable that its action varies according to the shape of the ala: if this be concave outwards, it is a dilator; if convex outwards, it is a constrictor. Its action is very slight. The Depressor Alee Nasi, or Myrtiformis. Dissection. Evert the upper lip, and remove the mucous membrane on each side of the frsenum. The two myrtiformes may then be separated by a vertical incision in the median line. It will be apparent that the myrtiformis and transversalis form only one muscle, whicli arises from the alveolar border near the lateral incisor, the canine and the anterior bicuspid teeth, and is dis- tributed to the orbicularis oris, the alae, and the septum of the nose. This muscle (i', fig. 114.) is short and radiated, and arises by a narrow ex- tremity from the incisive or myrtLform fossa of the superior maxilla, opposite the canine and two incisor teeth (incisif moyen, Winslow). Its fibres diverge upwards and outwards, and are inserted thus : the lower or descending, behind and in the substance of the orbicularis oris, and the upper or ascending, into the ala and septum of the nose. Its upper border is not distinct from the lower border of the transversalis. Chaussier, on account of its termination in the upper lip, regarded it as one of the origins of the orbicularis oris. Relations. It is covered by the buccal mucous membrane, by the orbicularis oris and the common elevator, and it lies upon the maxillary bone. It is continuous, without any line of demarcation, with the transversalis nasi. The inner border of the muscle of one side is separated from that of the other by an interval, corresponding to the fraenum of the upper lip. Action. It depresses the ala of the nose, and has also been considered a depressor of the upper lip (depressor labii superioris*, Cowper). I regard it rather as an elevator of that lip. The Naso-labialis of Albinus. This consists of a fasciculus which it is difficult to demonstrate in many subjects. It arises from the anterior extremity of the septum of the nose, passes horizontally backwardSj is then reflected downwards, and terminates like the preceding in the orbicularis, of which it may be considered a root. MDSCLES OF THE LABIAL REGION. The orbicularis oris. — Buccinator. — Levator labii superioris.— Caninus.— Zygomatici, major et minor.— Triangularis. — Quadratus menti. — Levator labii 'Atperioris. —Movements of the lips and those of the face. No region has so many muscles as the orifice of the mouth: seventeen, nine- teen and often twenty-one muscles are grouped round it, viz. the orbicularis oris' the common elevators of the alse and lip already described, the proper elevators of the lip, the great zygomatics, the canine, the buccinators, the triangulares, the quadrati or the levatores menti, and often two muscles on each side, viz. the risorius of Santorini, and the small zygomatic. The Orbicularis Oris. Dissection Make an elliptical incision round the openmg of the mouth, and dissect back the skin with great care, the mouth being previously dis- tended by the introduction of tow between the hps and alveolar borders. The olbicularis oris Q' I', figs. 113 and 114.), is the sphincter of the orifice of the mouth ; it is essentially the constituent muscle of the hps, occupying the entire space between the free edge of the upper hp and the nose, and the free edge of the lower lip and the transverse furrow above the chin. We shall consider, with Winslow, the orbicularis to be composed of two * Depressor hibii superioris alaque nasi of other writers.THE BUCCINATOK. 305 halves, each constituted by a demi-zone, of semi-elliptical concentric fibres, terminating on either side at the commissures of the lips. These fibres, which are all fleshy, do not become continuous opposite the commissures of the lips ; but only intersect each other, those of the upper half being continuous with the lower fibres of the buccinator, and those of the lower half with the upper fibres of the same muscle. The thickness of the two halves varies in different individuals, particularly around the free borders of the lips, where the fasciculi of the muscle are some- what everted. In the negro this is very remarkable. The thickness of the lips depending upon this circumstance must be distinguished from that which is the effect of a scrofulous habit. jRelalions. These muscles are covered by the skin, to which they adhere intimately, and hence the facility of bringing together the entire depth of the surface of wounds in the lips, by retentive applications to the skin only. They cover the mucous membrane, but are separated from it by the labial glands, the coronary vessels, and a great number of nervous filaments. Their outer circumference receives all the extrinsic muscles of the lips, which terminate in these as in a common centre. Their inner circumference circumscribes the opening of the mouth. The differences in the dimensions of this opening occasion the varieties observed in the size of the mouth, but the capacity of the buccal cavity is in no way influenced by these variations. Actions. These are exceedingly various, and may be studied as connected with the closing of the mouth, with the prehension of aliments by suction, with the playing upon wmd instruments, and with the expression of the coun- tenance. I shall here only notice the shutting of the mouth. _ This may be accomplished simply by the approximation of the jaws, which IS followed by a corresponding motion of the lips. In active occlusion, or that dependent on the orbicularis, two things may happen—either the lips may be closely drawn against the teeth, and their free edges applied to each other or they may be pushed forwards and puckered; in the latter case the buccal opening, which is usuaUy represented by a transverse line, resembles a circular or rather a lozenge-shaped orifice. The Buccinator. Dissection.

It is situated deeply behind, where it is covered by the ramus of the lower jaw, the masseter, and a small part of the temporal muscle ; from all these parts, however, it is separated by a considerable quantity of adipose tissue, and by a mass of fat which exists even in the most emaciated indivi- duals. More anteriorly it is covered by the zygomaticus major and the zygo- maticus minor, and the risorius of Santorini, where the two latter exist; and at the commissure it is covered by the canine muscle {levator anguli oris) and the trianeularis The Stenonian duct runs along this muscle before passing through it • the buccal nerves and the branches of the transverse facial artery he pa- rallel to its fibres ; the external maxillary (i. e. the facial) artery and vem pass perpendicularly across it near the commissure. A peculiar aponeurosis, called the buccal fascia, is closely united to it, and intervenes between it and all these parts. It covers the mucous membrane of the cheek, from which it is separated bv a dense layer of the buccal mucous glands. , , Action It is the most direct antagonist of the orbicularis. When the cheeks are not distended, its contraction elongates the opening of the mouth trans- verselv, and consequently renders the lips tense, and produces a vertical fold upon the skin of the cheek. This fold becomes permanent in the aged, and constitutes one of their most prominent wrinkles. .i. v • * When the cheeks are distended by air, or any other substance, the buccmator becomes curved instead of flat, and acquires all the properties of the former class of muscles. Thus the first effect of its contraction is, that its fibres be- come straight, or have a tendency to become so; gaseous, hqmd, or sohd Ss, are then expelled from the mouth -rapidly, if the orbicularis offer no obstac e! and gradually, should that muscle contract. The buccmator there- fore fulfils an important office in performances upon wind mstruments ; and hence iS name {blccinare, to sound the trumpet). In mastication i is of no fessTmportance, since it pushes the food between the teeth, and expels it from the sort of groove existing between the cheeks and the alveolar arches.

We often find some accessory fibres arising from this muscle, and attached to the skin opposite the commissure. Relations. Above, it is concealed by the levator labii superioris and the infra-orbitary vessels and nerves; below, it is quite superficial, being only covered by the skin. It covers the superior maxiUa, the buccinator, and the buccal mucous membrane. Action. It raises the angle of the mouth, and from its oblique position draws it inwards. The Zygomatici Major et Minor. Dissection. Make an oblique incision from the malar bone to the commis- sure of the lip, and remove carefully from the great zygomatic the fatty tissue which surrounds it. The Zygomaticus Major. This muscle (m',fig. 113.) is a cylindrical fleshy fasciculus extending from the malar bone to the commissure of the lip. It arises by tendinous fibres from the entire length of a horizontal furrow situated above the lower edge of the malar bone. The fleshy fibres approach each other so as to form a fasciculus, which passes obliquely downwards and inwards towards the commis- sure, where it is closely united to the canme muscle, and, like it, is continuous with the triangularis or depressor anguli oris. Relations. It is covered by the skin from which it is separated above bv the orbicularis palpebrarum, and below by a large quantity of adipose tissue'- It covers the malar bone, the masseter and buccinator muscles, a great col- lection of fat, and the labial vein. Action. It draws the angle of the mouth upwards and outwards; by carrvinff the commissure upwards it assists the canine muscle, but in drawing it out- ftag°°is.es the same. When the zygomatic and canine contract together, the commissure is drawn directly upwards. The Zygomaticus Minor.

All these fibres are concentrated into a narrow and thick fasciculus, which terminates at the commissure on a plane anterior to the fibres of the buccinator and the orbicularis oris, being evidently con- tinuous with the canine and the great zygomatic. Relations. It is covered by the skin, beneath which it is clearly discernible, and it covers the quadratus menti, the platysma, and the buccinator. Some colourless fibres which intersect those of the quadratus at a right angle, and moreover follow the same direction as those of the triangularis, may be re- garded as a dependence of that muscle, to the inside of which they are situated. They terminate in the skin, like those of the quadratus. Action. It depresses the angle of the mouth, thus antagonising the canine muscle and the great zygomatic, with which it is continuous. The continuity of these muscles is so manifest, that they may be regarded as constituting a single muscle, "broad and triangular below—bifid above, to form the canine and zygomatic—and narrow in the middle, where it corresponds to the commissure. The internal fibres of the triangularis, from their oblique direction, are directly opposed to those of the canine muscle; but its external fibres have not a similar relation to those of the zygomaticus major. The Quadratus Menti, or Depressor Labii Inferioris. Dissection. Dissect back the skin covering this muscle, cutting obliquely downwards and outwards. , . The quadratus menli {p',.fig.\\Z.; q',fig. 114.), situated to the inside of the preceding, is of a square or rather lozenge shape. It arises from the external oblique line of the lower jaw, and is in a great measure continuous with the platysma, the fibres of which pass behind and sometimes through the triangu- laris. From this origin it proceeds obliquely upwards and inwards, therefore in an opposite direction to the triangularis, and is inserted into the skm of the lower lip, on a plane anterior to the corresponding half of the orbicularis ons. It is closely united to the skin, and covers the lower jaw, the mental nerve and vessels, the lower half of the orbicularis oris, and the muscle next to be described, with which it is intimately connected. It is separated from the muscle ot the opposite side by the prominence of the chin below, but is blended with it ^^°leti(m. It depresses the lower lip: from the obliquity of this muscle, it also draws outwards and downwards each half of the lower lip, which is theretore stretched transversely.

Action. It raises and wrinkles the skin of the chin, and consequently raises the lower lip and projects it forwards. It appears somewhat singular, at first, that an elevator of the lip should be situated below it. General Considerations regarding the Movements of the Lips, and thgse of the Face in general. If we take a general view of the muscles of the face, we shall observe, 1. that no region is provided with so great a number of muscles; 2. that all these muscles are attached to a bone by one extremity, whilst the other is im- planted into the skin, or into other muscles; 3. that the cutaneous portion of these muscles is colourless and non-fasciculated, presenting all the charac- teristics of involuntary muscles *; 4. that those portions which are attached either to the bone or to other muscles have, on the contrary, all the characters of the voluntary muscles. All these'muscles are arranged around the several openings of the face, and consequently they are either constrictors or dilators; the orifice of the mouth, however, is peculiar f in having the greater number of the muscles of the face specially intended for it. Indeed the orbicularis oris, or sphincter of the mouth, is antagonised by the buccinators or transverse dilators; by the proper eleva- tors of the upper lip, and the common elevators of that and the alae of the nose; by the depressors of the lower lip, or quadrati; by the elevators of the angle of the mouth, viz. the canine muscles, the zygomatici majores, and, where they exist, the zygomatici minores, and the two risorii of Santorini; and, lastly, by the depressors of the commissure, or triangulares oris. The lips fulfil a great number of uses, all requiring a considerable degree of mobility. They serve for the prehension of aliments; for suctionj and for • the articulation of sounds,' whence the name labial given to consonants, spe- • cially produced by the action of the lips, as b,p,m: they modify the state of the expired air," so as to produce in it vibrations of a peculiar character, con- • stituting the act of whistling'; and in this respect they illustrate the mecha- nism of the glottis : they assist in mastication' by retaining the food, and con- stantly forcing it between the teeth: they are also employed, during perform- ances upon wind instrumentsi in regulating the volume of the column of air which strikes upon the body to be thrown into vibrations. The mechanism of their action varies according to the kind of instrument: sometimes, for example, they assist in graduating the rapidity of the column of air,'by in- . fluencing the orifice through which it issues, as occurs in playing upon the flute ; and sometimes they represent vibrating cords; situated at the mouth of . an instrument, and determining the different tones by their various degrees of tension. In this case, the lips themselves become the vibrating bodies, and propagate their oscillations to other bodies with which they are in contact, in- * This siinUarity is limited, however, to the colour and general aspect of the two kinds of Ted e?v'srmilIr",o'fhP.ti'nOH''=";S' ^"^"^r" °^'''' ^'"'^ '"'^ f°""<l to consist o^'^.r.d fibresf a^'o™cSc?;^'a'?e^'e\&"evi^'e'nt°J,'o^^^^ -'o "^^^ ^'"^^^^ l'J^'v'"'lu^" animals in the number of muscles attached to his lips.

Examples of this are observed in playing on the horn, trumpet, &c. If we examine tiie muscles of the face in connection with their influence in producing emotional expressions," we shall find that they are often almost com- pletely removed from the influence of the will, as, for example, where those emotions are not simulated; but that sometimes, on the contrary, their con- traction is altogether voluntary, as in those individuals, who either by profes- sion or habit are accustomed to imitate feelings which they do not really experience. Nevertheless, it should be remarked, that although the outward expression of every passion may be produced at will upon the face, yet there is always a great difierence between the natural emotion and the fictitious representation. On the whole, the general expressions of the countenance may be regarded as varieties of two great types,' viz. those of the cheerful and those of the melancholy emotions. The cheerful emotions are expressed by the expansion of the features, i. e. their retraction from the median line, a movement that is due to the occipito-frontalis, the levatores palpebrarum, and especially to the great zygomatic muscles. The melancholy passions, on the contrary, are ex- pressed by the approach or concentration of the features towards the median Une, which is chiefly effected on either side of the face by the corrugator supercilii, the depressor anguli oris, the common and proper elevators of the upper lip, the levator labii inferioris, and the quadratus menti. On account of the intimate connection between the skin of the face and the facial muscles, which, from the nature of their insertions, are in some measure identified with it, the frequently repeated contraction of one or more of these muscles occasions folds or wrinkles of the skin, that remain during the in- tervals of those contractions and after they have entirely ceased. And thus the continual experience of grave or cheerful emotions, with their characteristic expressions of countenance, at length impresses a peculiar and permanent stamp upon the features, so that those who are in the habit of closely observing such circumstances may in some degree judge of the disposition of an indi- vidual from an examination of his physiognomy. This is the only foundation of the system of Lavater. MUSCLES OF THE TEMPORO-MAXJLLAKT REGION. The viasseter and temporalis. 'J'he muscles of this region are four in number; two on each side, viz. the masseter and the temporal. The Masseter. Dissection. Make a horizontal incision along the zygoma, and a vertical one from the middle of this to the base of the jaw ; dissect back the flaps, taking care not to divide the Stenonian duct, which passes over the muscle. In order to see the deep surface, saw through the zygoma in two places, and turn it outwards. • , , The masseter (s, fig. 113.) is a short and very thick muscle, of an irregularly quadrilateral form, situated upon the side of the face. Attachments. It arises from the lower edge of the zygoma, and is inserted into the outer ssrface of the angle and ramus of the lower jaw. Its origin from the zygoma consists of a very thick aponeurosis, which embraces the anterior borders of the muscles, and is composed of several planes of super- imposed fibres, which are prolonged upon its surface and in its substance for a considerable distance. The fleshy fibres proceed from the inferior surface and the borders of this aponeurosis, obliquely downwards and backwards, and are inserted into the angle of the jaw, either directly or by means of very strong tendinous fibres. Not unfrequently a small triangular fasciculus is detached forwards to the inferior border of the body of the bone. The fleshy fibres arising from the posterior portion of the zygoma constitute a short, sniaU, andTHE TEMPORALIS. 311 X 4 almost entirely fleshy bundle, which passes vertically do^nw^ris, and is in- Sed beMnd the preceding into the external surface of the ramus of the jaw. Lastly the zygomatic arch being reversed, we see a still smaller fleshy fasci- cXs arising directly from its internal sui-face, and passing/or«;ar& to be Ltrterro^he oS surface of the coronoid process, and into the tendon of Tif covered by the skin, from which it is separated by a small fascia and oihetimes by a prolongation of the platysma; behind, it is covered bfth; parotirgird,^^^^ palpebrarum and zygomaticus m^or above, ft is cl-ossed at right angles by the divisions of the facial nerve the transverse artery of the face, and the Stenoman duct. It coy^^s the ramu of the jaw, the temporal and the buccinator muscles, from the latter of which it is separated by a collection of fat. Its anterior edge, which is prominent beneath the skin, has an important relation below to the facial artery, which may be compressed against the bone immediately in front of it. The parotid gland embraces its posterior border. rw Action The action of this muscle is very powerful. Its strength in different animals may be in some degree measured by the size of the zygomatic arch, and by the prominence of the lines and projections on the angle of the jaw. Its momentum, i. e. its period of most powerful action, occurs when the jaws are slightly separated, because its angle of incidence with regard to the lever is then nearly perpendicular. The general direction of the fibres of the masseter muscles, obliquely downwards and backwards, is highly advantageous, as re- n-ards the trituration of the food, for during the contraction of the two muscles the lower jaw is moved upwards and forwards. This same obliquity explains the action of the muscle in producing luxation of the jaw; for as its insertion is further hack than it would have been had the fibres been vertical, it follows that however slightly the jaws may be separated, the condyle is placed in front of the axis to which all the fibres of the masseter may he referred ; and when this muscle contracts, it increases the peculiar movement performed by the condyle in becoming dislocated forwards. T?ie Temporalis. Dissection. Having sawn through and turned back the zygoma, remove the fascia covering the temporal region, and the fat surrounding the insertion of the muscle into the coronoid process. In order to gain a view of the deep surface, detach the muscle, either from above downwards, by scraping the periosteum from the temporal fossa, or from below upwards, after having sawn through the base of the coronoid process. The temporal muscle {e',fig. 114.) or crotaphyte, so named because it occupies the whole of the temporal fossa (^Kp6ra<pos, the temple), is a broad radiated muscle, resembling a triangle with the base turned upwards. Attachments. It arises from the whole extent of the temporal fossa, and from the inner surface of the superficial temporal fascia, and is inserted into the edges and summit of the coronoid process. The fleshy fibres all arise directly, either from the temporal fossa, or from the inner surface of the fascia, which, being attached above to the entire length of the temporal semicircular line, and below to the upper edge of the zygomatic arch, is very tense, and thus affords a solid and very strong surface of origin. From these two parts the fleshy fibres converge, and proceeding downwards, the anterior obliquely backwards, the posterior obliquely forwards, and the middle vertically, form a fleshy mass which gradually increases in thickness until its fibres are attached, partly to the external, but chiefly to the internal surface and borders of the terminal aponeurosis. The fibres of this aponeurosis, which are very strong, and radiated at its commencement, are collected into the form of a very thick tendon, inserted into the coronoid process, and called the coronoid tendon. The temporal muscle, in its course from the temporal fossa to the coronoid process,312 MYOLOGY. undergoes a sort of reflexion over the groove at the base of the zycoraa. I mr?/^r/''° "'"^^"l^'- ™g from \he lower separate tendon into the internal border of the antlrior surf;ce of the ramusVf Relations. It is covered by the skin, the aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis the anterior and superior auricular muscles, the superficial tempLal arterie^' veins, and nerves, and more immediately by the superficial temporal apol neurosis, the zygomatic arch, and the masseter. It covers the temporal foTsa. he external pterygoid muscle, a small part of the buccinator, the interaal maxil- ary artery and the deep temporal vessels. Its thickness is in prSortTon to the depth of the temporal fossa, and the strength of the coronoid procesf Action. The strength of the temporal muscle, therefore, may be in some de- gree measured by the depth of the temporal fossa, and the size of the coronoid process This fact may be demonstrated by an examination of these regions in the skeletons of carnivorous animals, in which the elevators of the lo^er iaw are most highly developed. The use of the temporal muscle, like that of the masseter is to elevate the lower jaw, but the mechanism of its action is dif- ferent. In fact, the masseter raises the jaw by a direct action ; the temporal muscle, on the contrary, raises it by a sort of swing viotion, acting principaUv upon the back part of the coronoid process. In a word, the temporal muscle acts upon the vertical arm of the bent lever represented by the maxillary bone, while the masseter, on the contrary, acts upon its horizontal arm the movement depending on the action of the temporal muscle: the lower jaw resembles the curved lever represented by the hammer of a bell. THE PTERYGO-MAXILLARY REGION. The pterygoideus intemwt. — The pterygoideits externus. The muscles of this region are the external and the internal pterygoids. TJie Pterygoideus Interims vel Magnus. Dissection. Separate the face and that part of the cranium which is situated anterior to the vertebral column from the remainder of the skuU, and divide the face into two lateral halves by an antero-posterior section. This muscle may also be dissected in the following manner: saw through the lower jaw verticaUy at the junction of the body and ramus ; remove the zygomatic arch ; cut through the base of the coronoid process and the neck of the condyle, and then disarticulate the latter. Fig. 115. The internal pterygoid (a, fig. 115.) is deeply seated in the zygomatic fossa, along the inner surface of the ramus of the jaw (tertius musculus qui in ore latitat, Vesalius). It is thick, and qua- drilateral, and in its form, structure, and direction, bears a remarkable re- semblance to the masseter; hence Wins- low called it the internal masseter. Attachments. It arises from the ptery- goid fossa, from the hamular process, at the apex of the internal pterygoid plate, and from the lower surface of the py- ramidal process of the palate bone : and is inserted into the inner surface of the angle of the lower jaw. Its origin con- sists of a tendon resembling that of the masseter, prolonged upon the internal surface, and into the substance of theTHE PTERYGOIDEUS EXTERNUS. 313 muscle. From this the fleshy fibres proceed downwards, outwards, and bac/c- wards, to be inserted by very strong tendinous laminas into the lower jaw. Relations. On the inside it is in relation with the external peristaphyline muscle (tensor palati), and with the pharynx, a triangular interval existing be- tween it and the latter, occupied by a considerable quantity of cellular tissue, vessels, nerves, and the sub-maxillary gland: on the outside it corresponds with the ramus of the lower jaw, from which it is separated above by the dental and lingual nerves, the inferior dental vessels, and the so-called internal lateral ligament of the temporo-maxillary articulation. Action. As this muscle is inserted almost perpendicularly into the lever upon which it acts, it has very great power. Most of the remarks already made concerning the masseter apply to this muscle, which is a true internal mas- seter. It has only this peculiarity, that as its origin is nearer the median line than that of the external masseter, it assists in producing a slight lateral move- ment of the jaw, which is very useful in bruising the food. The Pterygoideus Externus vel Parvus. Dissection. This, like the preceding muscle, may be exposed by two opposite methods. The external pterygoid {b,fig. 115.) is very short, thick, and conoid, smaller than the preceding, and situated in the zygomatic fossa, extending horizontally from the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate to the neck of the con- dyle of the lower jaw. It arises from the whole outer surface of the external plate of the pterygoid process, and from the facette of the palatine process, at which it terminates below, from the ridge separating the temporal and zy- goinatic fossae, and from a spinous process at the extremity of this ridge, which appears to me worthy of notice. It is inserted into the fossa in front of the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw, and into the border of the inter- articular cartilage. Its origin consists of a strong tendon, prolonged into the substance of the muscle. From this the fleshy fibres proceed horizontally outwards and backwards, forming, at first, two distinct portions, between which the mternal maxillary artery often passes : these two portions then converge, are blended together, and terminate by some small tendinous fibres, which form the truncated summit of the cone represented by the muscle, and are attached to the neck of the condyle and to the inter-articular cartilage. Relations. This muscle is deeply situated, and is in relation on the outside with the ramus of the lower jaw, the temporal muscle, and the internal maxillary artery; on the mside with the interaal pterygoid, and above with the upper wall ot the zygomatic fossa. Action The axis of the external pterygoid being directed outwards and backwards and Its ongm being at the pterygoid process, it maybe readily imagined that its contraction wUl produce a horizontal motion i^ two direc- .T' "^^'^^^ """^ ^° opposite side from that on which the muscle is external pterygoids act together, the jaw is carried d rectly forwards.

Tlie deltoideus Supra-spinalus. — Infraspinatus and teres minor. Subscapularis. The muscles of the shoulder are the deltoid, the supra-spinatus, the infra- spinatus and teres minor (which I regard as only one muscle), and the sub- scapularis. The teres major, generally arranged among the muscles of this region, has already been described with the latissimus dorsi, of which it may be regarded as an accessory. The Deltoideus. Dissection. Make a horizontal incision through the skin, round the summit of the shoulder, extending from the external third of the clavicle to the most distant point of the spine of the scapula: from the middle of this incision let another be made, descending vertically half way down the humerus; dissect back the two flaps, taking care to raise at the same time a very thin aponeurosis, which is closely applied to the fibres. The deltoid {I, Jigs. 106. 109.), so named from its resemblance to the Greek delta A reversed, is a thick, radiated, triangular muscle, bent in such a way as to embrace the scapulo-humeral articulation before, on the outer side and behind. It is the muscle of the top of the shoulder. Attachments. It arises from the entire length of the posterior border of the spine of the scapula, from the external border of the acromion, and from the external third, i. e. from the concave part of the anterior border of the clavicle : it is inserted into the deltoid impression on the humerus. The scapulo-clavicular origin of the deltoid corresponds exactly to the inferior attachment or the in- sertion of the trapezius, so that these two muscles, although separate and dis- tinct in man, appear to form a single muscle divided by an intersection ; a view that is perfectly confirmed by a reference to comparative anatomy. The origin consists of tendinous fibres ; of these the posterior are the longest, and are blended with the infra-spinous aponeurosis, which also gives origin to some of the fibres of the deltoid. Three or four principal tendinous laminae, attached at regular intervals fo the clavicle and the acromion, penetrate into the substance of the muscle, and give origin to a great number of fleshy fibres. The largest of these laminae extends from the summit of the acromion, and its situation is sometimes indicated by a prominence of the skin, particularly during contraction of the muscle. From this very extensive origin the fleshy fibres proceed downwards, the middle vertically, the anterior backwards, and the posterior forwards: they form a thick broad mass, moulded over the top of the shoulder, and gradually converging, are at length inserted into the deltoid impression of the humerus by three very distinct tendons, the two principal of which, the anterior and posterior, are attached to the bifurcations of that V-shaped impression. Not unfrequently some fibres of the pectoralis major are connected with the front of this tendon. Relations. It is covered by the skin, the platysma intervening between them, by some supra-acromial nerves, and by a thin fascia extending from the infra-spinous aponeurosis, the spine of the scapula and the clavicle, and becoming continuous with the fascia of the arm. It covers the shoulder joint, from which it is separated by a tendinous layer continued from the infra-spinous aponeurosis and coraco-acromial ligaments, and which termi- nates on the sheaths of the coraco-brachialis and biceps muscles. Between this lamina and the greater tuberosity of the humerus, there is a quantity of filamentous cellular tissue, and frequently a synovial bursa. The deltoid therefore is inclosed in a proper fibrous sheath, and glides over the articulation. It also covers the upper third of the humerus, the coracoid process, the tendons of the pectorales, coraco-brachialis, biceps, supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus and teres minor, teres major, and biceps muscles, also the circumflex vessels and nerves The anterior border of the deltoid, directed obliquely downwards and outwards, is separated from the external margin of the pectoralis major by aTHE SUPRA-SPINA.TUS. 315 cellular interval; but is frequently in contact with it. The cephalic vein and a small ai-tery define the limits of the two muscles. The posterior border is thin above, where it is applied to the infra'-spinatus muscle, and becomes thick and free below. The inferior angle of the deltoid is embraced by the brachialis anticus. Issues are generally established over this situation. Remark. The structure of this muscle has been patiently investigated by some anatomists, who have counted the exact number of its component fas- ciculi. These are separated by fibro-cellular prolongations, like the fasciculi of the glutEEus maximus; sometimes even the muscle is divided into three distinct portions above, viz. a clavicular, an acromial, and a spinal. Eighteen or twenty small penniform fasciculi, the bases of which are generally turned upwards, are collected into a small space by mutually overlapping each other, and are united by their terminating tendons. Albinus admits ten of these bundles which he has described separately. Action. The deltoid elevates the shoulder (elevator, attollens humerum). From the threefold direction of its fibres, it has a different action, according to the particular set of fibres employed. The middle fibres raise the humerus directly, the anterior raise and carry it forwards, the posterior raise and carry it back- wards. When the arm is raised, Bichat states that the anterior and posterior fibres can depress it; but I do not think this possible. There has been no example recorded of luxation from the over action of this muscle. When the arm is fixed, as in the act of climbing, the shoulder is moved upon the head of the humerus. The trapezius must be regarded as the most powerful an- tagomist of the deltoid, since the scapulo-clavicular attachments of both muscles are the same. Thus we have seen that the diaphragm and the transversalis abdominis are separated only by their costal insertions. The most complete antagonism follows from such an arrangement, for then one fibre is, as it were, opposed to another, having exactly an opposite direction. The action of the deltoid is however less powerful than might have been supposed from its size; it is, in fact, parallel to the lever on which it acts. Whilst almost aU other muscles have a momentum, occui'ring at the period when their fibres are inserted at the most favourable angle, the deltoid, properly speaking, has none ; it is parallel to the lever during the entire period of its action. This is the reason why the elevation of the arm is so feeble a movement; and why contraction of the deltoid is always accompanied by con- siderable fatigue. The Supra-spinatus. Dissection. Take off the trapezius, and in order to see the whole extent of the muscle, remove the clavicle, and saw through the base of the acromion. The supra-spinatus (r,fig. 106.) is a thick triangular muscle, broad on the inside, narrow without, occupying the supra-spinous fossa, and retained therein by a strong aponeurosis, which completes the osteo-fibrous sheath in which the muscle is inclosed. Altachiients. It arises from the internal two thirds of the supra-spinous fossa, and is inserted into the highest of the three facettes on the greater tuberosity of the humerus. Its origin from the supra-spinous fossa is partly tendinous and partly fleshy, and some fibres arise from its aponeurotic invest- ments. From these points the fleshy fibres converge to a tendon, which is lound among them, where the muscle reaches the upper part of the joint, and which IS slightly reflected over the head of the humerus before reaching its insertion. This has not the shining appearance of other tendons, but has the dull aspect of many ligaments; it is blended with the fibrous articular capsule, trom which it cannot be separated near its insertion. It may even be regarded as torming the upper part of the capsular ligament. lieiations. It is covered by the trapezius, the clavicle, the coraco-acromion ligament, and the deltoid; and it covers the supra-spinous fossa, the supra-MYOLOGY. 315 scapular vessels and nerves *, and the upper part of the shoulder joint. Its tendon is often blended with that of the infra-spinatus, and is separated from that of the sub-scapularis by the long head of the biceps, and the accessory ligament of the capsule. Action. It raises the humerus, and therefore assists the deltoid. Notwith- standing the number of its fibres, and its perpendicular insertion into its lever, it has very little power, on account of the proximity of that insertion to the fulcrum. Its principal action appears to me to have reference to the joint, affording a support to it above, and forming a sort of active arch, the resisting power of which is in proportion to the force tending to thrust the humerus upwards against the osteo-fibrous arch, composed of the acromion and coracoid processes and their connecting ligament. There is no muscle then to which the name of articular can be more correctly applied. The use of the deep fibres in preventing the folding of the fibrous and synovial capsules, and their compression between the two articular surfaces, though much insisted on by Winslow, appears to me very problematical. The Infra-spinatus and Teres Minor. Dissection. Detach the scapular origin of the deltoid, and saw through the base of the acromion. The infraspinatus (s) and teres minor (t,fig. 106.) constitute a single, thick, triangular muscle, broad on the inside and narrow externally, and occupying the infra-spinous fossa, in which it is retained by an aponeurosis, ex'kctly resembling that of the supra-spinatus muscle. It arises from the internal two thirds of the infra-spinous fossa, from a very strong fascia interposed between it and the teres major and long head of the triceps, and by a few fibres from the infra-spinous aponeurosis: it is inserted into the middle and inferior facettes on the greater tuberosity of the humerus, below the insertion of the supra-spinatus. It arises from the infra-spinous fossa, directly by fleshy fibres, and also by means of tendinous fibres attached along the ridges of that fossa. One of these laminae is constantly found attached to the ridge situated on the outer side of the infra-spinous groove: this has doubtless given rise to the division of the muscle into two parts, called the infra-spinatus and the teres minor. From these origins the fleshy fibres pro- ceed, the superior horizontally, the next obliquely, and the inferior almost vertically outwards: they form a thick, triangular, fleshy body, and become attached to the anterior surface and margins of a flat tendon, which glides upon the concave humeral border of the spine of the scapula, to be inserted into the humerus. Not unfrequently we find the lower fibres of the portion called the teres minor, arising from the posterior surface of the tendon of the triceps, becoming applied to the under part of the capsular ligament, and in- serted into the humerus immediately below the greater tuberosity. Relations. These two united muscles are covered by the deltoid, the tra- pezius, the latissimus dorsi, and the skin; and they cover the infra-spinous fossa from which they are separated by the supra-scapular nerves and vessels; they'also cover the capsular Ugament of the joint, and a small portion of the long head of the triceps. Their lower or external border corresponds inter- nally or inferiorly with the teres major, an aponeurotic septum intervening between them, and externaUy or superiorly with the long head of the triceps. Action This muscle rotates the humerus outwards and a httle backwards. When the arm is raised, it assists in keeping it in this position, and carries it backwards But an important use of this muscle is that of retaining the head of the humerus in its place, preventing its displacement backwards, and pro- tecting the posterior part of the articulation. • The suiira-scapular nerve generally passes through the coracoid notch by itself, and the Bupra-scapular artery above the ligament.317 THE SUB-SCAPULARIS. The Sub-scapularis. Dissection. Detach the upper extremity, including the shoulder from the trunk of the body; remove from the inner surface of the muscle the ceMar tissue, the lymphatic glands, the brachial plexus, the axillary vessels, and the serratus magnus; and dissect off, with care, the thm fascia which mvests it. The sub-scapularis {p,figs. 110. 116.) is a thick triangular muscle, occu- pying the whole of the sub-scapular fossa, beneath the axiUary border of which it passes: by itself it represents the supra- and mfra-spinatus and teres minor, upon the posterior scapular region. We not unfrequently meet with tendinous laminee di^ading it into three parts, which correspond to those three rniisclfts. Attachments. It arises from the internal two thirds of the sub-scapular fossa, by tendmous laminae attached to the oblique ridges already described as existing on that part of the scapula; also from the anterior lip of the axillary border of the scapula by an aponeurosis, which separates this muscle from the teres major and the long head of the triceps. Very frequently the lowest fibres arise from the anterior surface of this head of the triceps, just as we have seen that the lower fibres of the teres minor take their origin from the posterior surface of the same head of that muscle. From these different origins the fleshy fibres all proceed outwards, the upper horizontally, and the lower obliquely, gradually approaching more and more to the vertical direc- tion. The muscle therefore becomes progressively narrower and thicker, imtil its fibres are attached to the two surfaces and borders of a tendon which is inserted into the entire surface of the lesser tuberosity of the humerus. Some of the muscular fibres are inserted below the tuberosity; and I have seen the inferior fibres of the muscle attached for a certain extent to a fibrous prolongation that completes the bicipital groove behind. Belaiions. The posterior surface of this muscle lines the sub-scapular fossa, which it entirely fiUs, and from which it is separated at the outer third by some cellular tissue and the sub-scapular vessels and nerves; more externally, it covers the upper and anterior part of the capsular ligament of the shoulder joint, turning around it, and becoming identified with it at its insertion. Its anterior surface is in relation with the serratus magnus, the sub-scapular fascia and some very loose cellular tissue intervening between them; also with the axillary vessels and nerves, and with the coraco-brachialis and deltoid muscles. The upper border of its tendon glides in the hollow of the coracoid process, which serves as a pulley, and forms with the coraco-brachialis and the short head of the biceps a sort of ring, partly bony and partly muscular, in which the tendon is retained. Between this tendon and the coracoid process there is also a synovial bursa, which sometimes extends over the tendons of the biceps and coraco-brachialis, and always communicates with the synovial capsule of the shoulder joint.* Action. It is essentially a rotator inwards of the humerus. In proof of this we find that the muscle is stretched when the arm is rotated outwards, and relaxed when it is rotated inwards. The movement of rotation is much more considerable than the length of the neck of the humerus would lead us to imagine, and this arises from the muscle turning round the head of the bone. As a rotator muscle, then, it is congenerous with the latissimus dorsi. When the humerus is raised, the sub-scapularis tends to draw it downwards. And lurther, this muscle as well as the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, and teres minor, is essentially an articular muscle, and is sometimes completely identified with the anterior part of the fibrous capsule: in all cases it offers an active resistance to displacement forwards, and is therefore always torn in this kind ot dislocation. • See note, p. 38D.MYOLOGY. 318 - Triceps extensor cubiti. MUSCLES OF THE ARM. The biceps. — Brachialis anticus. — Coraco-brachialis. The muscles of the arm have been divided into those of the anterior region, viz. the biceps, the coraco-brachialis, and the brachialis anticus ; and those of the posterior region, which constitute the single muscle called the triceps. Anteeior Brachiai, Region. The Biceps. Dissection. Make a vertical incision through the skin from the middle of the clavicle to the middle of the bend of the elbow ; dissect back the flaps, and divide longitudinally the brachial fascia, which is united to the biceps by Very loose cellular tissue; preserve the vessels and nerves which lie along the inner border of the muscle. Expose the upper part of the muscle by detaching the pectoralis major and deltoid from their clavicular origins, and turning them inwards and outwards. In order to trace the whole extent of the long head of the biceps, open the capsular ligament above; and to see the radial insertion of the muscle, flex the fore-arm to a right angle upon the arm, and supinate it forcibly; it is better, however, to wait until the muscles of the anterior region of the fore-arm are dissected. The biceps flexor cubiti (a, fig. 116.) is a long muscle forming the superficial layer of the anterior region of the arm; it is divided above into a short and long head *; and hence its name biceps. Attachments. It arises by its short head from the apex of the coracoid process, and by its long head from the top of the glenoid cavity; and is inserted into the bicipital tuberosity of the radius. The origin of the short or coracoidhesA (b,fig. 116.) consists of a flat and very thick tendon, common to it and the coraco-brachialis, and terminating in front of this part of the muscle in an aponeurosis, from which is given off a tendinous septum, between the biceps and the coraco-brachialis. The long, glenoid, or reflected head arises by a tendon apparently fonn- ing a continuation of the glenoid articular border, which penetrates into the interior of the joint, turns over the head of the humerus upon which it is re- flected, and thus reaches the bicipital groove. It is retained in this groove by a sort of fibrous bridge or canal, traverses the whole of its extent, and ends in a sort of tendinous cone open behind, from the in- terior of which the fleshy fibres take their origin. These fibres are collected into a rounded belly, which, about the middle of the arm, is applied to the mus- cular belly of the short portion, equally rounded and of variable size, and ulti- mately becomes identified with it. The single muscle {a, fig. 116.), thus formed, is very thick, flattened from before backwards, and directed vertically like the two original fasciculi. Its fibres are attached to the surfaces and edges of an aponeurosis, which gradually becomes narrower and thicker until it emerges in the form of a free tendon opposite the lower end of the humerus, a little nearer to the outer than the inner side. This flattened tendon sinks downwards and • Not unfrcquently the biceps is tried above.

This folding and torsion are of extreme utility in preventing displacement of the muscle, which thus fastens down itself. The tendon of insertion having given off from its anterior surface and external margin a broad aponeurosis, constituting the principal origin of the fascia of the fore-arm, glides over the bicipital tuberosity of the radius, from which it is separated by a bursa, and is inserted into the posterior part of that process. Relations. The upper third of the two heads of the biceps as well as the coraco-brachialis, and the axillary vessels and nerves, are contained in the cavity of the axilla, between the pectoralis major and the deltoid in front, and the latissimus dorsi and teres major behind. In this part of its course the short head of the biceps is in relation with the coraco-brachialis on the inside, "and behind with the sub-scapularis, which separates it from the shoulder-joint; a bursa intervenes between these two muscles. The tendon of the long head is in contact with the head of the humei-us, and surrounded by the synovial membrane, which isolates it from the cavity of the joint, and accompanies it for a greater or less distance along the bicipital groove. Below the axilla the biceps is subcutaneous in front, the brachial fascia intervening between it and the skin, through which it is very clearly defined; behind, it is in relation with the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and the coraco-brachialis and brachialis anticus muscles ; on the inside, with the brachial artery and its accompanying veins and with the median nerve, all of which lie along its internal border, by the pro- jection of which they are protected. The tendon is embraced at its insertion by the supinator brevis, and it is separated from that of the brachialis anticus by a bursa. Great attention should be paid to the relation of this muscle to the brachial artery. I am accustomed, when speaking of the surgical anatomy of these parts, to call the biceps the satellite muscle of the brachial artery. It is worthy of remark, that the relative positions of the long and the short head are altered as the humerus is rotated inwards or outwards; in rotation inwards the long head is placed behind the other, or even crosses to the inner side oi it; but in rotation outwards the interval between the two heads is considerably increased. Action. The biceps flexes the fore-arm upon the arm, and at the same time supinates it. This last effect results from the insertion of the muscle into the inner and back part of the bicipital tubercle of the radius. The momentum of the biceps occurs during semi-flexion of the fore-arm; its inser- tion being at that period perpendicular to the lever, the disadvantage arising from its proximity to the fulcrum is then counteracted. The length of its fibres explains the extent of the movement of flexion. By means of its sca- pular attachments the biceps acts upon the arm, either secondarily, after bending the fore-arm, or primarily, when the fore-arm is extended. By means of both its heads it carries the arm forwards, and thus co-operates with the anterior fibres of the deltoid and coraco-brachialis. The two heads also assist in strengthening the shoulder joint. The long head forms a sort of fibrous arch, which supports the head of the humerus and retains it in the glenoid cavity. The short head, together with the coraco-brachialis, fonns a continuation of the hook of the coracoid process, and protects the anterior and inner part of the joint. The biceps is, as Winslow first showed, one of the principal supinators of •f , It is in this movement that the tendon glides over the bici- pita tuberosity of the radius by means of the intervening bursa. This tube- rosity is almost entirely intended for the tendon to glide over; it is therefore hX tlf T'^'S*^-.^'"^^ ''^^'''^ granulations, as pointed out by Halkr, are found upon the synovial bursa of the tendon. ^ When the fore-arm is fixed, as in climbing, the biceps flexes the arm uponMYOLOGY. the fore-arm, and the scapuhi upon the arm. Lastly, it is a tensor of the fascia of the fore-arm, upon which the internal fibres of the muscle often terminate. The Brachialis Anticus. Dissection Cut the biceps across, opposite the insertion of the deltoid and turn down the lower part upon the fore-arm. ' The brachialis anticus (brachialis internus, Alb., d d, fig. 116 • d fin 117 -) is a thick, prismatic, and triangular muscle, situated behind the" 'pr'ecedine It arises from the humerus below the insertion of the deltoid, which it embraces by a well-marked bifurcation ; and since the pobt of insertion of the deltoid is not always the same, it foUows that this origin of the brachialis anticus is also variable: it also arises from the internal and external surfaces and from the three borders of the humerus, and from the external and internal inter-mus cular septa. It is inserted mto the rough surface on the fore part of the coronoid process of the ukia. The different origins from the humerus are fleshy, the fibres being of very various lengths, and proceeding in diflFerent directions ; the middle pass verticaUy downwards, the external somewhat ob- hquely inwards, and the internal outwards ; they all terminate on the pos- terior surface of an aponeurosis, which is broad and thin above, and thick below, especially on the outer side, where it turns round so as to embrace the outer border of the muscle, and forms a deep aponeurotic lamina. The fleshy fibres therefore are received into a semi-cone of tendinous substance open on the inside, the fibres of which are collected together and finally inserted into an oblique line, running downward^ and outwards, below the coronoid process of the ulna. Relations. The anterior surface of the brachialis anticus is in relation with the biceps, the musculo-cutaneous nerve, the brachial fascia, the brachial artery and veins, and the median nerve; its internal surface, with the pronator teres muscle, the ulnar nerve, and the triceps, from which it is only separated by the internal inter-muscular septum ; its external surface, with the supinator longus and the extensor carpi radialis longior, which are received into a sort of groove presented by it, the radial nerve establishing the limit between these two muscles and the brachialis anticus. The posterior surface embraces the internal and external surfaces of the humerus, to which it is attached; below, it embraces and effectually protects the front of the elbow joint, into the anterior ligament of which many of its fibres are inserted. Action. The brachialis anticus flexes the fore-arm upon the arm, and reciprocally the arm upon the fore-arm. Its momentum takes place, like that of the biceps, during semi-flexion. It is worthy of remark that this muscle acts with greater precision than the biceps upon the fore-arm, because it arises from the humerus only, and besides that it belongs more especially than that muscle to the elbow joint. I have already said that it may be regarded as the active anterior ligament of this articulation. In fact it so completely limits the movement of extension, that we cannot imagine the possibility of luxation of the fore-arm backwards, without rupture of this muscle. From the inser- tion of the biceps into the radius, and of the brachialis anticus into the ulna, it follows that the flexor muscles of the fore-arm are divided between the two bones, in the same manner as those of the leg are distributed to the tibia and fibula. Thus, the contraction of the brachialis anticus has a tendency to carry the fore-arm outwards as well as to flex it, while that of the biceps tends to draw it inwards. When the two muscles contract simultaneously, direct flexion is the result. The Coraco-brachialis. Dissection. The upper part is exposed as soon as the deltoid is detached; the middle is situated between the pectoralis major and the latissimus dorsi; and the lower part is seen upon th& inner surface of the humerus near the tendon of the deltoid.321 THE TRICEPS EXTENSOR CUBITI. The coraco-brachialis (e,figs. 116, 117.) is the smallest muscle of the arm. It is situated at the inner and upper part of the arm, and was confounded by most of the older anatomists with the short head of the biceps, with which indeed it is intimately united at its upper part. Attachments. It arises from the apex of the coracoid process, and is in- serted towai'ds the middle of the internal surface and border of the humerus. It arises from between two tendinous layers, the most superficial of which is common to it and the short head of the biceps, and also from the septum between these two muscles. From this origin the fleshy fibres proceed, forming an elongated, thin, and flat bundle, the size of which is always in an inverse ratio to that of the short head of the biceps; this bundle passes down- wards, backwards, and a little outwards, to be inserted into the humerus, between the brachiaUs anticus and the triceps. Its insertion is efiiected by means of a flat tendon, which receives the fleshy fibres successively upon its edges and external surface, and is accompanied by them even to its attach- ment to the bone. The precise situation of the attachment varies Uke that of the deltoid, and hence the different statements of authors regarding this point. According to Winslow, the coraco-brachialis is inserted at the upper part of the middle third of the humerus; according to M. Boyer, in the middle of the bone; and, according to Bichat, a little above its middle. I have found it inserted at the junction of the lower with the two upper thirds. Relations. It is covered by the deltoid, the pectoralis major, and the biceps, and it covers the sub-scapularis, the latissimus dorsi, and the teres major. Its relations to the axillary and brachial arteries and the median and musculo- cutaneous nerves ai-e the most important. Above, it covers these parts, and then it is in relation with the outer side of the brachial artery and median nerve, so that its tendon alone separates the vessel from the bone. The musculo-cutaneous nerve passes through it; hence the name oiperforatus Casserii has been given to this muscle. It is also very frequently perforated by one of the branches of origin or roots of the median nerve. Action. It carries the arm forwards and inwards, and at the same time elevates it. It co-operates with the anterior fibres of the deltoid, and the superior fibres of the pectoralis major. If the arm be fixed, it depresses the top of the shoulder ; when the arm is carried backwards and turned inwards It draws it forwards again, and rotates it outwards. * ' Posterior Brachial Region.

It is inserted into the back of the olecranon. The origin of the middle or long head (which we shaU find to be analogous to the rectus cruris) *, consists of a tendon that is blended with the glenoid ligament, nearly in the same manner as the long tendon of the biceps. This tendon is flattened from before backwards, and soon splits into two layers, united by their outer edges, the posterior of which is thin and short, while the anterior is very thick, especially at its outer edge, and prolonged to the middle of the muscle. The head of the humerus, therefore, is bound by the long head of the triceps below, in the same manner as by the long tendon of the biceps above. The fleshy fibres arise from between the two layers above mentioned, and form a bundle flattened in front and behind, which immediately turns upon itself, so that its anterior surface becomes posterior, and vice versa. From this sort of torsion the strongest layer of the tendon, which was originally in front, eventually occupies the posterior surface of the muscle. The fleshy fibres arising from between the two layers, and especially from the anterior sur- face and borders of the now posterior tendon, pass downwards and a little outwards, to be inserted, some into the anterior but the greater number into the posterior surface of an aponeurotic expansion, the external border of which is continuous with a similar structure belonging to the external division of the muscle. The aponeurotic fibres are collected together into a very thick tendon, which is folded into a semi-cone, within which the fleshy fibres termmate ; the tendon itself is inserted by a thick mass into the inner and back part ot the olecranon, on the outer side of the internal portion of the muscle, and closely united with the posterior aponeurosis of the external portion. A sj-novial capsule intervenes between this tendon and the olecranon. a-„\a^ The origins of the external and internal portions from the humerus divide between themselves, so to speak, the posterior surface of that bone, to which the lone head has no attachments. , , . , , , external head if, figs. 116, 117.), which is larger than the m ernal, and from LaloS may be ti;med the vastus exiernus of the triceps brachu (cubitum exTudeS secundus, Vesalius; ancone externe, Winslow), arises partly bf flesSSpartly by endinous fibres.

The inferior fleshy fibres of this portion of the muscle are very short and horizontal, and seem to be continued by the anconeus. The internal head of the triceps (tertius cubitum extendentium, Vesalius; ancone interne, Winslow, g,figs. 116, 117.), which we denominate the vastus internus of the triceps brachii, might be called the deep and internal portion of this muscle, for, as we find with regard to the vastus internus of the thigh, it is almost entirely covered by the other two portions. Its origins are partly fleshy and partly tendinous. The fibres pass in different directions, the ex- ternal downwards and inwards, a few to the anterior surface of the aponeurosis of the external head, by which they are concealed, but the greater number directly to the olecranon, in front of the insertion of the other portions. The internal pass downwards and outwards, and terminate, some upon the inner edge and anterior surface of the tendon of the long head, but the greater number directly upon the olecranon, to the inside of that tendon. The lowest of these fibres are almost horizontal. Some of the deepest fasciculi are gene- rally given off from the body of the muscle to be inserted into the synovial capsule of the elbow joint. Relations. It is covered through nearly its whole extent by the hrachial fascia, and separated by it from the skin, through which it is distinctly de- fined ; it covers the posterior surface of the humerus, the back of the elbow joint, the radial nerve, and the deep humeral artery. It is separated from the muscles of the anterior region of the arm by the external and internal inter- muscular septa. Its long or scapular portion is in relation with the deltoid and the teres minor behind, and with the sub-scapularis, the teres major, and the latissimus dorsi in front. , Action. The triceps extends the fore-arm upon the arm, but in order that its long head may act with effect, the scapula must be fixed by other muscles. The power of this muscle is not so great as its size and the number of its fibres would indicate, on account of its disadvantageous insertion near the ful- crum. It is true that here, as in the case of the triceps femoris, nature has as much as possible counterbalanced this disadvantage by inserting the muscle, not into the apex, but into the back part of the olecranon. We even find, as we have said, a synovial bursa between the tendon and that part of the ole- cranon with which it is in contact. It would appear, at first sight, that the momentum of this muscle would occur during semi-flexion, but a little consi- deration would show, that, like the triceps femoris, it has, properly speaking, no momentum; and that the olecranon, which may be regarded as the ossified tendon of the muscle, always has the same relation to the ulna, whatever be the position of the fore-arm. It should also be observed, that this muscle has not nearly so much power during semi-flexion as during extension, because m the former case it is opposed by the flexor muscles, which in that position act with the greatest possible effect; while in the latter, when the arm and fore-arm form an obtuse angle, the extensor muscle has the advantage. I^astly, the predominance of the extensor over the flexors is less marked in the arm than in the thigh; and even supposing the extensor to possess more intrinsic power, it has less active force, in consequence of the insertions of the flexors being much more favourable, both as regards their distance from the Mcrum, and their nearer approach to a perpendicular direction. Thus flexion evidently predominates at the elbow, and extension at the knee. This, indeed, ought to be the case, for in the upper extremities the flexion of the elbow IS the movement of attraction and prehension; whUst in the lower ex- tremities the extension of the knee is an essential position in standing walking, running, and leaping. ^ •^^fifsuppose the possibility of rupture of the olecranon at its junction witn the coronoid process during violent extension of the fore-arm, an iT^T,.

Sometimes the lower extremity of the triceps becomes its fixed point, and then it extends the arm upon the fore-arm, and the shoulder upon the arm. MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM.

The muscles of the fore-arm are divided into those of the anterior, the ex- ternal, and the posterior regions. Muscles of the Anterior Region. These muscles form four very distinct layers. The first consists of the pronator teres, the flexor carpi radialis, the palmaris longus, and the flexor carpi ulnaris; the second is formed by the flexor sublimis digitorum; the third by the flexor profundus digitorum and the flexor longus pollicis; and the fourth by the pronator quadratus. » The Pronator Teres. Dissection. This muscle is exposed when the inner and anterior part of the ig fascia of the fore-arm is removed. Its origin should be \ ' ■ carefully studied. ■ The pronator teres or rotundus (a, fig. 118.), the most supei-ficial muscle on the anterior and inner aspect of the fore-arm, forms an oblique ridge under the skin, upon the inner side of the bend of the elbow. It is attached above to the inner condyle of the humerus, or epitrocMea (a, fig. 119.), and is inserted below into the middle of the radius (a')- It arises from the lower part of the inner border of the humerus, from the inner condyle, from a large intermuscular septum separating it from the flexor carpi radialis and the flexor sublimis, and from the coro- noid process of the ulna on the inner side of the bra- chialis anticus, by means of a tendinous and fleshy bundle, which is separated from the rest of the muscle by the median nerve. From these origins the fleshy fibres pro- ceed obliquely downwards and outwards (pronateur ob- lique, WinsL), surrounding a flat tendon, which appears first on the anterior surface of the muscle and then turns over the anterior and external surfaces of the radius, to be inserted at the middle of that bone. The muscle there- fore turns spirally around the radius, but not so com- pletely as the supinator brevis. Its insertion may take place opposite any point in the middle third of the bone. Relations. It is covered by the fascia of the fore-arm, by the supinator longus and extensor carpi radialis, and b V the radial artery and musculo-spiral nerve: it covers the brachialis anticus and flexor sublimis, the median nerve by which it is first perforated, and the ulnar artery. A r T-hn oTPiter the amount of supination of the fore-arm, the more eff^ctarisTh\^&Sis muscle as a pronator, because thenit is muchTHE PALMARIS LONG US. 325 Y 3 more completely rolled around the radius. I may remark, that on account of its obliquity it is inserted into the radius at an angle of 45°; and that, conse- quently, the direction in -which it operates is rather favourable. It acts with greater advantage in proportion as it is inserted nearer to the upper end of the radius; and, for tliis reason, its power must vary considerably in dif- ferent individuals. When pronation is carried as far as possible, the muscle then becomes a flexor of the fore-arm. After the preceding examination of this muscle, we need no longer be surprised at the great energy of the move- ment of pronation, which is much more powerful than that of supination ; nor yet that it is the most natural position of the fore-arm, for the pronator teres can more than counteract the two supinators taken together. In fracture of the bones of the fore-arm, this muscle tends to obliterate the interosseous space. The Flexor Carpi Radialis. Dissection. It is sufficient to divide and dissect off the anterior part of the fascia of the fore-arm, in order to expose this muscle, which may be recog- nised by the following description : — The flexor carpi radialis (radialis internus, Albinus, b, fig. 118.) is situated immediately within the pronator teres, occupying the superficial layer of the anterior aspect of the fore-arm, and being, as far as its tendon is concerned, the most superficial of all these muscles. It arises from the lower part of the internal border and from the inner condyle of the humerus {b,fig. 119.), and is inserted (6') into the second metacarpal bone. Its origin consists of a tendon common to it and to the pronator quadratus, palmaris longus, flexor sublimis, • and flexor carpi ulnaris. The fleshy fibres immediately arise from within a sort of pyramidal aponeurosis given off by this common tendon, and from the body of the muscle, at first slender, then increasing in size, and again tapering towards its attachment to the two surfaces and edges of a tendon, which forms the lower two thirds of the muscle, and passes obliquely outwards and down- wards to the level of the OS scaphoides; it there penetrates into a groove formed by the scaphoid and the trapezium, is reflected inwards along this oblique groove, and terminates upon the second metacarpal bone, spreading out so as to embrace its upper extremity; it also gives off a tendinous ex- pansion to the trapezium, and sometimes one to the third metacarpal bone. Relations. It is covered by the fascia and the skin, through which it is very clearly defined: it is m relation behind with the flexor subUmis; on the out- side with the tendon of the flexor poUicis, over which it passes at an acute angle so as to bmd it down ; and lower down with the wrist joint.

It is a small, fusiform, slender, fleshy bundle (c. Jig. 118.), of about four inches in length, arising {c,fig 119.) from the inner condyle of the humerus to the inner side of the preceding muscle, and from a small tendinous cone, which isolates it from that muscle, the flexor sublimis, and the flexor carpi ulnaris. The fleshy fibres terminate around a flat tendon, which constitutes the lower two thirds of the muscle (whence the name palmaris longus), proceeds vertically downwards and a little outwards, and terminates by expanding in front of the anterior annular ligament {g, figs. 118, 119.) of the wrist, and becommg contmuous with the middle palmar fascia (c'j^jr. 118.). _ . This muscle is subject to a great many varieties, and is often wanting; its fleshy belly is sometimes very long, and occasionally occupies the middle of the muscle. . , , ^ ■ j- ?• \ Relations. The same as those of the preceding muscle (Jlexor carpi radialis); its tendon is very superficial. It is separated from the neighbouring muscles by a very strong sheath. . ^ , v Action It is a tensor of the palmar fascia. When this effect has been pro- duced, it flexes the hand upon the fore-arm. According to Winslow, it would assist the flexor carpi radialis in pronation. The Flexor Carpi Ulnaris. Dissection.

Its rmmenturn, as well as that of the preceding muscle, occurs during semi-flexion of the hand upon the fore-arm. Dissection. The Flexor Suhlimis Digitorum. The portion of tWs muscle, situated in the fore-arm, is exposed hy cutting, across the middle, and turning aside the pronator teres, the flexor carpi radlalis, and the palmaris longus, which form a superficial layer in front of it. With a Uttle care the origin of this muscle may he separated a.s far as the inner condyle of the humerus. In removing the pronator teres, it is necessary to he extremely careful to avoid dividing the radial origin of the flexor suhlimis, which forms a very thin prolongation under the pronator. The cdssection of the pabnar and digital portions of the muscle is the same as that of the flexor profundus. . Divide the anterior annular ligament of the carpus vertically, and remove the palmar fascia : examine the disposition of this structure opposite the heads of the metacarpal bones, and also the relations of the tendons of the flexor suhlimis and flexor profundus in the palm of the hand; then dissect the digital sheaths, which must be divided in order to display the singular manner in which the tendons of the flexor subbmis bifurcate and turn round, so as to embrace the corresponding tendons of the flexor profundus. The^exor superficialis, suhlimis, or perforatus (e e,Jig. 118.; e, fig. 119.) is a broad, flat, thick muscle, divided into four portions below. It arises from the internal condyle or epitrochlea of the humerus, and from the ulnal^ and radius, and is inserted into the second phalanges of the fingers. It arises from the epitrochlea by the common tendon, from a rough surface m the fore part of the inner side of the coronoid process of the ulna, and also from about two inches of the radius. This latter origin consists of ten- dinous fibres attached to that oblique portion of the an- terior border of the bone, which extends inwards to- wards the bicipital tuberosity, and from which arise the supinator brevis above, the flexor longus pollicis below, and the muscle we are now describing in the middle. A great number of fibres also arise from the broad apo- neurotic septa which divide this muscle from the flexor carpi ulnaris, and from the other muscles of the super- ficial layer, viz. the pronator teres, the flexor carpi ra- dialis, and the palmaris longus. From these different origins the fleshy fibres proceed vertically downwards, forming a broad and thick belly, which is almost immediately divided into four portions. These at first are in juxta-position, but soon become arranged in two layers, like the tendons of the extensor communis, viz. one anterior and larger, consisting of the divisions for the median and ring fingers (the latter not being so strong as the former), and another pos- terior, formed by the divisions for the index and little finger. Each division is, indeed, a small muscle, having its own particular tendon, around which the fleshy fibres are arranged, at first regularly, and afterwards on one side only: they are thus semi-penniform muscles. The two posterior divisions are not so distinct as the anterior, and have a peculiar arrangement: they generally constitute two small digastric muscles ; that is to say, a fleshy belly terminates upon a flat tendon, which, becoming enlarged, gives origin jn its turn to a new fleshy belly. The four tendons, after emerging from the fleshy328 MYOLOGY. fibres, pass together under the annular ligament (g) of the carpus, in conjunction with the median nerve, which lies on their outer side, and is often mistaken for a tendon, and with the tendons of the flexor profundus digitorum and the flexor longus pollicis. This thick bundle of tendons having reached the palm of the hand, is then distributed in a manner to be noticed after the description of the flexor profundus, with the tendons of which those of the flexor sublimis are intimately connected. Relations. It is covered by the pronator teres, the flexor carpi radialis, the palmaris longus, the flexor carpi ulnaris, and the fascia of the fore-arm ; and it covers the flexor profundus digitorum, from which it is separated by the ulnar vessels and nerves: it also covers the median nerve, and the flexor longus pollicis, to which it generally sends a tendinous and fleshy prolongation. The Flexor Profundus Digitorum. Dissection. This muscle is exposed by cutting across the flexor sublimis and the flexor carpi ulnaris. The flexor profundus or perforans (i, figs. 119, 120.) is situated under the superficisd flexor, which it exceeds in size, but resembles it in being divided below into four portions. Attachments. It arises from the upper three fourths of the internal and anterior surfaces of the ulna, from a well- marked cavity situated on the inner side of the coronoid process behind the rough eminence which gives attach- ment to the internal lateral ligament of the elbow, from the inner two thirds of the interosseous ligament, from that part of the fascia of the fore-arm which covers the inner surface of the ulna, and lastly, by a few fibres, from within and below the biciajtal tuberosity of the radius. It is in- serted into the fronfof the bases of the last phalanges of the fingers {i,figs. 119, 120.). The fleshy fibres arise directly from these numerous origins, and proceed vertically downwards, the internal fibres alone being directed somewhat obliquely forwards and out- wards. The belly of the muscle thus formed continues to increase in size, and is then divided into four unequal portions, each constituting a semi-penniform muscle. These four small muscles are in juxta-position, and termi- nate in as many flat tendons, which occupy the lower two thirds of the anterior surface of the entire muscle, and are remarkable for being divided into very regular and closely united parallel bands of a nearly white colour. The four tendons emerging from the fleshy fibres at various heights, but always above the anterior annular ligament ot the carpus, pass under this ligament conjointly with the ten- dons of the flexor sublimis, the flexor pollicis longus and the median nerve. In this situation they are placed behind the tendons of the the meaian "er-^^- arraneed in two layers, as we have already seen.

If vre divide any of these digital sheaths, we find the tendon of the superficial flexor becoming flattened and hollowed underneath, as it were, into a groove, which is exactly moulded upon the tendon of the deep flexor. About the middle of the first phalanx the tendon of the sublimis (,e,jfig. 119.) bifurcates, and gives passage to that of the profundus, which it embraces by turning round it like the thread of a screw, and becoming posterior instead of anterior, as it was before. The two halves of the tendon then reunite to form a groove having its concavity directed forwards, and again separate to be in- serted into the rough edge of the groove on the second phalanx. The tendon of the flexor profundus (i'i', figs. 119, 120.), on the contrary, passes directly through the sheath formed by that of the flexor sublimis, and is inserted into the third phalanx. The tendons of the flexor profundus, moreover, present in their whole course, very slightly apparent traces of division. From the relation of the tendons of the two flexors to each other, the superficial muscle has been called the per/oratus, and the deep one the perforans. Relations. These should be examined in the fore-arm, in the palm of the hand, and along the fingers. In the fore-arm the flexor profundus is covered by the flexor sublimis, from which it is separated by an incomplete tendinous septum, and by the median nerve. It covers the ulna, the interosseous ligament, and the pronator qua- dratus ; it corresponds within to the flexor carpi ulnaris, and without to the flexor longus pollicis. The ulnar vessels and nerves are, at first, situated be- tween this muscle and the flexor sublimis, and afterwards separate it from the flexor carpi ulnaris. In the palm its tendons are subjacent to those of the flexor sublimis, and cover the interosseous muscles and the adductor poUicis. The lumbricales muscles take their origin from them. Along the fingers its tendons are in relation behind with the grooves of the phalanges, and with the metacarpo-phalangal and phalangal articulations, and, in front, with the tendons of the sublimis, and the fibrous sheaths of the fingers. Action of the two flexors. These muscles flex the third phalanx upon the second, the second on the first, this again upon the corresponding metacar- pal bone, and lastly, the hand upon the fore-arm. The flexor sublimis has no action upon the third phalanges. Its origin from the internal condyle of the humerus enables it to act upon the fore-ann and to assist in flexing it upon the arm. It is scarcely necessary to say that the bifurcation of the tendons of the flexor sublimis is intended to afibrd a sheath to, and bind down, those of the flexor profimdus. The flexor profundus flexes the third phalanx upon the second, the second upon the first, the first upon the corresponding metacarpal bone, and, lastly, the hand upon the fore-arm. The Lumbricales. The lumbricales (^x,figs. 119, 120.) are small fleshy tongues which may be regarded as accessories of the flexor profundus. They are four in number, distinguished as the first, second, &c. counting from without inwards. They extend from the tendons of the flexor profundus to the first phalanges of three or four fingers. They arise from the tendons after these have passed through the annular hgament; the first and the second, in front of the tendons for the index and middle fingers; the third, in the interval between those for the middle 1 vlfi^ nngers; and the fourth, in the interval between those for the rine tprf;.lii ^^Tl ^^^'^ ^^^y proceed, those near the median linl vertica ly, and those at either side obliquely downwards, to the outer side of the metacarpo-phalangal articulations of the corresponding fingers, where thev erminate by a broad tendinous expansion inserted into the fdges of he ex tensor tendons, and completing the sheath which those tendon! foi-m on theMYOLOGY. 330 back of the first phalanges. The tendon of the third lumbricalis appears to me to be almost always inserted, not into the outer side of the ring finger, but into the inner side of the middle finger; an arrangement that cannot well be ac- counted for. It is not uncommon to find this third lumbricalis bifurcated, and attached not only to the inner side of the middle, but to the outer side of the ring finger. delations. They are placed between and upon the tendons of the flexor pro- fundus, and have, therefore, the same relations as those tendons in the palm of the hand; they are also in relation with the sides of the metacarpo-phalangal articulations, and the tendons of the interosseous muscles Action. It is difiicnlt to determine their actions precisely. Vesalius has de- scribed them as adductors, and Spigelius as flexors. I agree with Riolanus in regarding them as specially intended to keep the extensor tendons closely ap- plied to the phalanges, and to serve instead of a proper sheath. They are of use also in binding together the extensor and flexor tendons, and preventing the displacement of either. The Flexor Longus PoUicis. Dissection. The same as that of the flexor profundus. The flexor longus pollicis {I, fig. 119, 120.) is situated upon the same plane as the flexor profundus digitorum, of which it may be considered a division; it is thick, elongated, and penniform. Attachments. It arises from the upper three-fourths of the radius, from the contiguous portion of the interosseous ligament, from the anterior border of the radius, and not unfrequently by a prolongation, tendinous at its extremities and fleshy in the middle, from the flexor sublimis digitorum. It is inserted into the upper end of the second phalanx of the thumb. The fleshy fibres arise directly from these origins, pass vertically downwards, and are attached to the posterior surface of a flat tendon, which forms a continuation of the series of tendons of the flexor profundus on the outside, and like them is divided into bands. The fleshy fibres accompany the tendon as far as the anterior annular ligament of the carpus; it then passes beneath this ligament, is reflected over the inside of the trapezium, and proceeds obliquely outwards along the first metacarpal bone. When it reaches the metacarpo-phalangal articulation of the thumb, it is received in an osteo-fibrous sheath, resembling ' in every respect that of the tendons of the other fingers, and, like them, is in- serted in front of the upper extremity of the ungual phalanx of its corre- sponding finger (Z,^jr. 120.). . . , „ • J- 1- Relations. It is covered by theflexor sublimis, the flexor carpi radialis, the supinator longus, and the radial artery; it covers the radius and the inter- osseous Ugament, from which it is separated above by the interosseous vessels and nei-ves, and below by the pronator quadratus. Its tendon is the most ex- ternal of those which pass under the anterior annular Ugament of the carpus, after leaving which it is received into a deep muscular groove formed by the muscles of the baU of the thumb, and is ultimately enclosed in its own osteo- ^^Sf^lt flexes the last phalanx of the thumb upon the first, this upon the firf metacarpal bone, and then the hand upon the fore-arm In order to Serstand its action precisely, we must suppose the muscu ar force to be ^ncentrated upon the upper end of the reflected portion; it is then easy to see that it dr^ws the phalanges inwards, while flexing them. It is therefore an opponens muscle. The Pronator Quadratus. Dissection. Cut across aU the tendons occupying the lower part of the anterior region of the fore-arm, and this muscle will be exposed.THE SUPINATOR LONGUS. 331 This small muscle (le petit pronateur, Bichat, m,figs. 119,120.) is situated at the lower part of the anterior region of the fore-arm, and forms the deepest layer of this region. It is regularly quadrilateral, and thicker than at first sight it appears to be. „ , . , -l j /. ^i. Attachments. It arises from the lower fourth of the internal border of the ulna, which is directed so decidedly backwards inferiorly, that the muscle is rolled round the bone; also from an aponeurotic layer much thicker below than above, directed obliquely upwards and outwards, and occupying the inner third of the muscle, upon which it terminates in a number of elegant inter- sections ; lastly, from all that portion of the anterior surface of the ulna, upon which it lies. From these origins the fibres proceed horizontally outwards (le pronateur transverse, Winslow), becoming longer as they are more super- ficial, to the lower fourth of the external border, anterior surface, and internal border of the radius. Relations. It is covered by the flexor profundus digitorum, the flexor longus pollicis, the flexor carpi radialis, and the radial and ulnar arteries, and it partially covers the two bones of the fore-arm and the interosseous ligament. Action. The pronator quadratus tends to approximate the two bones of the fore-arm ; but as it is rolled around the ulna, which is immoveable, it causes the radius to turn upon that bone, and is therefore a pronator. Its action in much more energetic than would at first sight appear: this depends on the number of its fleshy fibres, which are arranged in several layers, the most superficial being the longest. The Muscles of the External Region of the Fore-arm. The muscles of this region are, the supinator longus, the extensores carpi radiales, longior and brevior, and the supinator brevis. The Supinator Longus. Dissection. The brachial portion of this muscle is exposed in the dissection of the brachialis anticus and the triceps, and the portion situated in the fore- arm, by removing the fascia from the outer and anterior aspect of the muscles of this region. The supinator longus (f,Jigs. 118.121.), which is the most superficial muscle of the external and anterior aspect of the fore-arm, belongs both to the arm and the fore-arm (brachio-radialis, Scemmering), and constitutes in a great measure the oblique ridge forming the external boundary of the bend of the elbow. It is a long flat muscle, fleshy in its upper two-thirds, and tendinous in its lower third. Attachments. It arises from the outer border of the humerus, and from the external inter-muscular septum of the arm ; the extent of its humeral attach- ment vari^ from the lower fourth to the lower third of that bone, and is limited above by ttie groove for the musculo-spiral nerve. It is inserted into the base of the styloid process of the radius. The fleshy fibres proceed from their origins downwards, forwards, and a little inwards, to form a fleshy belly, which is flattened from without inwards, and is applied to the brachialis anticus. After reaching the lower end of the humerus, the fleshy belly becomes flattened from before backwards, and passes vertically downwards. At first it is thick, but, during its progess, it expands and becomes thin, until its fibres terminate suc- cessively upon the anterior surface of an aponeurosis, which becomes entirely tree from fleshy fibres above the middle of the fore-arm, and is graduaUy con- tracted into a flat tendon that is inserted into the styloid process of the radius. Helalions. It is covered by the fascise of the arm and fore-arm: in the arm It is enclosed in the same sheath with the brachialis anticus, from which it is separated by the radial or musculo-spiral nerve; in the fore-arm it has a sheath proper to itself: it is in relation with the brachialis anticus, which is at first wiihm and afterwards behind it; then with the extensor carpi radiaKs longior332 MYOLOGY. the tendon of the biceps, the supinator brevis, the pronator teres, the flexor carpi radialis, the flexor digitorum sublimis. the flexor longus poUicis, the radial artery and veins, and the radial nerve. Its inner border limits the bend of the elbow on the outside : the radial artery emerges from beneath this border, and then lies parallel to it. Its outer border is separated from the extensor carpi radialis longior by cellular tissue, and inferiorly is in contact\yith the dorsal branch of the radial nerve, which, at first, was situated beneath it. The most important of aU these relations is that with the radial artery, of which the long supinator may be considered the satellite muscle, and might be designated the muscle of the radial artery. Action. It might be asked. Why does the supinator longus form an exception to the general rule, in being inserted into the lower end of the lever which it is intended to move ? for while the fore-arm is in a state of supination, the axis of the muscle is vertical, and its action appears limited to that of flexing the fore-arm; but if the limb be pronated, the direction of the muscle becomes obUque from without inwards, and, therefore, supination is the result of its contraction. After this efi^ect has been produced, if the muscle stiU continues to act, the fore-arm is flexed upon the arm. It is needless to state that the dis- tance of its insertion from the fulcrum gives the muscle great power, notwith- standing its disadvantageous angle of incidence. The Extensor Carpi Radialis Longior. Dissection. This muscle, as well as the succeeding one, wiU be ^posed at the same time as the supinator longus, beneath which it is placed. The lower end of its tendon occupies the dorsum of the wrist, and should also be exposed. The extensor carpi radialis longior premier ou long radial externe ; radialis extemus longior, Albinus, n, figs. 119. 121.) is situated on the external and posterior aspect of the fore-arm, below the supinator longus, of which it seems to be a continuation at its origin from the humerus : like that muscle it is flat- tened from within outwards in the arm, and from before backwards in the fore-arm : it is fleshy in its upper third, and tendinous m its lower two-thirds. Attachments. It arises from the rough triangular impression terminating the external border of the humerus, from the external mtennuscular septum and from the anterior surface of the common tendon It is inserted into the back of the upper end of the second metacarpal bone The fleshy fibres arising directly from the parts mentioned constitute a bundle, at first flattened on the sides, and forming a continuation of the supinator longus from which it is often difficult to separate it: it afterwards becomes flattened from before back- wards.

It is inserted into the back part of the upper end of the third metacarpal bone. The fleshy fibres, thus arising from the ex- ternal condyle by means of an aponeurotic pyramid, are attached to the pos- terior surface of a tendon which becomes gradually narrower and thicker as it receives them. The fibres themselves terminate about the middle of the fore- arm, and then the fiat tendon passes backwards into the same groove on the radius as that of the last-named muscle, the two tendons being retained in it by the same fibrous sheath, and lubricated by the same synovial membranes, but separated from each other by a small vertical ridge of bone. After leaving the common sheath, the tendon of the short separates from that of the long radial extensor, passes stUl more posteriorly, and is inserted into the third metacarpal bone {o',figs. 121,122.). Relations. It is covered by the preceding muscle, and like it is crossed ob- liquely on the outside by the long abductor, the short and then the long ex- tensor muscles of the thumb : it covers the external surface of the radius, from which it is separated by the supinator brevis above, and the pronator teres in the middle. Its tendon covers and protects the back of the wrist. In con- sequence of the different length of their fleshy fibres, the supinator longus and the two radial extensors of the carpus are arranged one above the other, the highest being the supinator longus, and the lowest the extensor carpi radialis brevier. Action of the two radial extensors. These two muscles, which from their in- sertions might be called the posterior radials, extend the second row of the carpus upon the first, and this upon the fore-arm; they are also abductors of the hand, for they incline it towards the radial side of the fore-arm. The extensor carpi radialis longior being attached to the humerus, can assist in flexing the fore-arm. The Supinator £revis. Dissection. _ Pronate the fore-arm forcibly. In order to expose this muscle completely, divide the two radial extensors of the carpus, and even some of the muscles of the superficial layer on the back of the fore-arm. The supinator brevis (p,fgs. 119, 120. 122.) is a broad muscle curved into the form of a hollow cylinder, and rolled round the upper third of the radius: It forms by itself the deep layer of the external region of the fore-arm. Attachments. It arises from the external lateral Ugament of the elbow, with which It IS blended, and by this means from the external condyle ; from the annular hgament of the radius; from the external border of the ulna, which is provided with a projecting ridge for this purpose; from a deep triangular exca- vation, in front of this ridge, and below the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna: and, lastly, from the deep surface of an expansion of its tendon of origin and the external lateral hgament, which covers the greater part of the muscle. From these difi-erent origins (fig. 122.) the fleshy fibres pass round the radius, into the posterior, external, and anterior surfaces of which bone they are inserted. i?q "ton ? ^^<='P^*^^ ^'^^^'■''^^ a°<i *e tendon of the biceps (figs. t^^'JiVf ^^f^ afieshy prolongation of this muscle, covering the an- 2i extensor '''' ^'6^^"*°^ *e radius, of which it might be regarded nin^tSl^' supiJiator brevis is covered by the radial extensors, the su- tensor H J^r""'- .pronator teres, the extensor communis digitorum, the ex- ar?e^ tflTT' ''^''P' anconeus, and the radial iTgament the elbnw T^T '^'^ '^^^'^ also its annular Keep bran?n7ti 'v","^ '^"^ mterosseous ligament.

No muscle in the body is so completely rolled around the lever that it is intended to move, for it forms five sixths of a cylinder; it is therefore the chief agent in supination, and the supinator longus can only be regarded as an accessory. Muscles of the Posteeiok Region of the Foee-aem. The muscles of the posterior region of the fore-arm constitute two very dis- tinct layers, one superficial, comprising the extensor communis digitorum, the extensor digiti minimi, and the extensor carpi ulnaris; the other deep, com- prising the abductor pollicis longus, the extensor brevis and extensor longus pollicis, and the extensor indicis. Muscles of the Superficial Layer. One mode of dissection is common to all these muscles. Make a circular incision through the skin at the lower part of the arm ; pronate the arm, and make a perpendicular incision from the external condyle of the humerus to the third metacarpal bone, entirely dividing the sub-cutaneous cellular tissue down to the fascia; remove this fascia by careful dissection, except where it is very adherent. Trace the tendons of the extensor muscles along the back of the fingers. TTie Extensor Communis Digitorum. The extensor communis digitorum (6, fig. \2l.), situated at the back of the Fib 121 fbre-arm, simple above and divided into four portions ■ below, arises from the external condyle of the hume- rus, and is inserted into the second and third phalanges of the four fingers. Its origin consists of a tendon common to it, and to the extensor carpi radialis brevior, extensor digiti minimi, and extensor carpi ulnaris. This tendon consists of a four-sided pyra- mid, and is formed by the fascia of the fore-arm, by a lamina separating this muscle from the extensor carpi radialis longior, by another lamina separating it from the extensor digiti minimi and the extensor carpi ulnaris, and lastly by another situated between it and the supinator brevis. The fleshy fibres arising from the interior of this pyramid form at first a thm, but afterwards a much larger muscle, which becomes flattened from before backwards, and soon divides into four fascicuU. The two middle fasciculi, mtended for the middle and the ring fingers, are stronger than those destined for the index and Uttle fingers, z. e. the two extreme fascicuU, which, lower down, become placed in front of the middle fascicuU. In this manner they all pass under the dorsal ligament (r fin 121.) of the carpus in a proper shea,th After leaving this sheath, in which they are provided with a synovial capsule* extending both above and below the dorsal Ugament, the four tendons become situated on the samfXne and diverge from each other ; the two SidKdons proceed along the backs of the cor- resDonding metacarpal bones; the external and in- Sal tendons (6' b',fi9.121.) correspond to the inter- V Pross obliquely in order to assume a posiUon behind osseous spaces, which they cro h ^ Having reached the the heads of the metacarpal bones to wm j-THE EXTENSOR DIGITI MINIMI. 335 * See note, p. 389 metacarpo-phalangal articulations, the tendons become narrower and thickened, and eive off on each side a fibrous expansion, attached to the sides of the jointj they then enlarge again so as to cover the dorsal surface of the first phalanges, receive and are re-inforced by the tendons of the lumbricales, and opposite the articulation of the first with the second phalanx, they divide into three portions, one median, which is implanted upon the upper end of the second phalanx, and two lateral, which pass along the sides of the second pha- lanx, approach each other at the lower half of the dorsal surface of the second phalanx, unite by their neighbouring edges, and are inserted into the upper end of the third phalanx. Opposite the metacarpal bones they sometimes split into two or three small juxta-posed tendons, and at the lower end of these bones the tendons for the Uttle, ring, and middle fingers communicate with each other by expansions of variable size, and sometimes by a true bifurcation (see Jig. 121.). The tendon for the index fimger is alone free. The communica- tion of the tendon of the little with that of the ring finger takes place opposite the metacarpo-phalangal articulation, by means of a transverse band, which forms a projection under the skin. Lastly, we not uncommonly see a tendinous prolongation arising from the anterior surface of these tendons, and inserted into the upper end of the first phalanx. Belations. The extensor communis digitorum is covered by the fascia of the fore-arm, from which a great number of its fibres arise superiorly, by the dorsal ligament of the carpus and the dorsal fascia of the metacarpus, which separate it from the skin : it covers the supinator brevis, the three long muscles of the thumb, the extensor proprius indicis, the lower radio-cubital articulation, the carpus, the metacarpus, and the fingers. Action. This muscle extends the third phalanx upon the second, the se- cond upon the first, the first upon the corresponding metacarpal bone, then the carpus, and lastly the radio-cubital articulation. It is necessary for me to mention the independence of the muscular fasciculi proceeding to each finger: this is peculiar to man, and is much more remarkable in some individuals than in others. By continual exercise, the faculty of extending one finger without the others may be acquired. The tendon for the index is generally the only one not united to the others, and therefore the movements of this finger are by far the most independent. The Extensor Digiti Minimi' This is a very slender muscle (extensor proprius auricularis, Albinus, c, jig. 121.) placed on the inner side of the common extensor, to which it appears to be an appendix. It is difficult to trace its origin as far as the common tendon, with which it is connected only by an aponeurotic prolongation. Its fleshy fibres arise from this prolongation, and from a fibrous pyramid which separates it from the muscles of the deep layer, from the extensor communis digitorum externally, and internally from the extensor carpi ulnaris, and is completed superficially by the fascia of the fore-arm. The fibres constitute a small fu- siform fleshy belly, which accompanies the tendon (at least on one side), as far as the head of the ulna; there the tendon enters a special fibrous sheath formed behind the head of that bone ; it is then reflected inwards to the fifth metacarpal bone, behind which it is retained in a thinner sheath, which, like the preceding, is lined by a synovial membrane.* The tendon then splits into two bands, of which the external (or radial) receives the inner bifurcation of the extensor communis. The three tendinous prolongations becoming united, envelop, as in a sheath, the dorsal aspect of the first phalanx of this hnger ; having reached the articulation of the first with the second phalanx, they divide into three portions, which are attached precisely in the same manner as the tendons of the extensor communis. Actum. As its name indicates, this muscle extends the little finger. ItMYOLOGY. 336 might at first sight be imagined that this finger might be moved independently, since it receives a separate muscle; but the connection of its tendon with that of the extensor communis, renders any such independent action as difficult as in the other fingers, and much more so than in the index finger. The Extensor Carpi Ulnaris. The extensor carpi ulnaris (e, fy. 121.), the most superficial and the most internal * of the muscles on the back of the fore-arm, arises from the external tuberosity of the humerus ; from the posterior surface of the ulna, which is a little excavated for this purpose; from the middle third of the posterior border of-that bone ; and from the anterior surface of an aponeurosis covering the muscle behind. It is inserted behind the upper end of the fifth metacarpal bone. Its origin is effected by means of a fibrous pyramid, the apex of which is attached to the outer tuberosity of the humerus. From the interior of this pyramid, and from the other origins above-mentioned, the fleshy fibres pro- ceed to a tendon, which by a very uncommon arrangement extends through the substance of the muscle, even from its superior attachment, without com- mencing in the form of an aponeurosis. At the lower third of the fore-arm, this tendon appears on the posterior border of the then semi-penniform muscle, and continues to receive fleshy fibres on its anterior edge until it enters the groove intended for it on the ulna. This oblique groove is continued as far as the insertion of the tendon into the metacarpal bone, by means of a long fibrous sheath, and is lined throughout by a synovial membrane. Relations. The extensor carpi ulnaris is covered by the fascia of the fore- arm : it covers the ulna, the supinator brevis, and the muscles of the deep layer. Action. It extends- the second row of the carpus upon the first, and this upon the fore-arm. It is at the same time an adductor of the hand, which it inclines towards the ul- nar border of the fore-arm. The Anconeus. The anconeus (brevis anconeus, Eustacliius; le petit ancone, Winslow, g, figs. 121, 122.) is a short triangular muscle, so named from its situation (ayKiiv, the prominence o£ the elbow). It appears to be a continuation of the ex- ternal portion of the triceps, from which it is only separated by a very slight cellular interval. Attachments. It arises from the back part of the outer tuberosity of the humerus, and is inserted into the outer side of the olecranon, and a triangular surface bounded in- ternally by the posterior border of the ulna. Its origin from the condyle consists of a tendon quite distiuct from that common to the muscles on the back part of the fore- arm. This tendon splits into two diverging bands. The fleshy fibres arismg from these proceed inwards, the upper horizontally, the lower obliquely downwards, and are in- serted directly into the outer side of the olecranon so as to be continuous with the triceps, and into the surface of the ulna. , . » ^i.

Action. It extends the fore-arm upon the arm, aild vice versa; from its oblique direction, it can also rotate it inwards. Muscles of the Deep Layer. Dissection. This is the same for all the muscles of the deep layer of the fore-arm, and consists in removing the muscles of the superficial layer, espe- cially the extensor communis digitorum and the extensor digili minimi. The Abductor Longus Pollicis. The abductor longus pollicis (extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, i,figs. 121,122.) is the broadest, thickest, and most external muscle of the deep layer (le grand abducteur, Bichat). Attachments. It arises from the ulna below the origin of the supinator brevis, from the interosseous ligament, from the radius, and from a tendinous septum between it and the extensor longus pollicis. It is inserted into the upper end of the first metacarpal bone. From the above-mentioned origins the fleshy fibres proceed obliquely downwards and outwards, constitute a flattened fusi- form belly, and are successively attached to the posterior surface of an apo- neurosis, which becomes condensed into a flat tendon ; this tendon turns round the radius, crossing over the radial extensors of the carpus, and at the same time ceasing to receive any fleshy fibres; it is then received into the outer groove on the lower end of the radius, conjointly with the tendon of the ex- tensor brevis pollicis, a small fibrous septum intervening between them, and finally is inserted into the first metacarpal bone. This tendon is almost always divided longitudinally into two equal parts, and not unfrequently the division extends up to the fleshy portion. Of these two divisions one is inserted into the first metacarpal bone, the other furnishes attachments to the abductor brevis poUicis. Relations. It is covered by the extensor communis digitorum and extensor digiti minimi: it lies immediately under the fascia, from the outer side of the radius to its termination. It covers the interosseous ligament, the radius, the tendons of the radial extensors of the carpus, and the outer side of the wrist joint, where it may be easily distinguished under the skin. Action. It extends and abducts the first metacarpal bone : for a long time it was called the extensor of the thumb; but its chief use is, as Albinus first remarked, m abduction. Winslcw observes that, from its obliquity, it can act as a supinator ; lastly, it assists in extending the hand. The Extensor Brevis Pollicis. This muscle (extensor primi internodii poUicis, I, figs. 121, 122.) is situated internally to the preceding, which it exactly resembles in figure and direction, and with which It was for a long time confounded (partie du premier extenseui^ du pouce SaO ' ^""^ '^^'^'^^^ <^P«^^* extenseur ^""T^^-^ '■'""'i'; occasionally from the ulna, and from the interosseous TtfSj "T'f'^ ""^^ ''PP^'' ^""^ °f the first phalanx of the thumb. tendinous fibres, the fleshy fibres proceeding from f"""^^" fasciculus, having a similar arrangement to thatTf he preceding muscle ; its tendon is received into the same fibrous shea h biU rhet^phlirxl''"'"" ^ "P'^' ^""^ iusSdi Relations.

It extends the first phalanx upon the first metacarpal bone, and then ■becomes an abductor and extensor of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. The Extensor Longus Pollicis. This muscle (extensor secundi internodii pollicis, m.,figs. 121,122.) is much larger than the extensor bre-vis, within and parallel to which it is situated. It arises from a considerable extent of the ulna, from the interosseous ligament, and from the tendinous septa dividing it from the extensor carpi ulnaris, and the extensor proprius indicis : it is inserted into the upper end of the second phalanx of the thumb. The fleshy fibres form a flat fusiform bundle, directed obliquely like the preceding muscle; they terminate in succession around a tendon, which emerges from them at the carpal extremity of the ulna, enters a special osteo-fibrous sheath, and crosses obliquely over the tendons of the two radial extensors, being separated from the tendons of the abductor longus and extensor brevis pollicis by an interval which may be readily distinguished through the integuments, and gives rise to the hollow on the outer side of the wrist, commonly called the salt-cellar. The tendon next crosses obliquely over the first interosseous space, gains the inner edge of the first metacarpal bone, and then that of the first phalanx, upon which it is expanded, and pro- ceeds to be inserted into the second or ungual phalanx of the thumb. Relations. Its general relations are the same as those of the preceding muscle. Action. Its uses are also the same ; but it acts in a special manner upon the second phalanx of the thumb, which it extends upon the first before exerting any influence upon this last-mentioned bone. It has less power in abduction than the preceding muscles. The Extensor Proprius Indicis. This is an elongated fusiform muscle (indicator, Albinus, r, fig. 122.) like the preceding, below and paraUel to which it is situated. It arises from the ulna, the interosseous ligament, and a septum intervening between it and the extensor longus polUcis : it is inserted into the two last phalanges of the index finger The fleshy fibres proceed obliquely from their origins and terminate around a tendon, which they accompany as far as the sheath of the extensor communis digitorum : into this sheath the tendon enters, and, havmg escaped from it, crosses obliquely over the carpus and the second interosseous space, becomes situated on the inside of the tendon given off to the mdex finger by the extensor communis, unites intimately with that tendon opposite the lower end of the metacarpus, and terminates with it in the manner already indicated. Its re?a«w;(s are the same as those of the precedmg muscles. Action. It enables the index finger to be extended independently of the others, and hence, without doubt, arises the particular use of that fanger. 1 should add, that the union of its tendon with the one furnished by the com- mon extensor is so intimate, that its independence of action would have been much kss had not the fleshy fasciculus of the common extensor destmed for it been itself almost isolated.

The pabnaris brevis may be included m this region. described with the tendons of the flexors of the fingers. Muscles of the Thenar Eminence, or Muscles belonging TO THE Thumb. I divide these into three muscles inserted into the outer side of the first phalanx of the thumb, or into the first metacarpal bone, and a single muscle inserted into the inner side. The former are the abductor brevis, the op- ponens, and the flexor brevis; the latter consists of the adductor, m which 1 include a part of the flexor brevis of authors generally. Muscles inserted into the Outer Side of the First Phalanx of the Thumb, or into the First Metacarpal Bone. Dissection Make an oblique incision from the middle of the annular liga- ment of the carpus to the outer side of the first phalanx of the thumb, and a circular incision round the wrist; detach the flaps, raise the external and middle paknar fasciae, and then cautiously separate the muscles of this region, which are recognised by the following characters. The Abductor Brevis Pollicis. This is the most superficial of the muscles constituting the ball of the thumb {q,fig- 119.). It arises by tendinous and fleshy fibres from the os sca- phoides, from the upper, anterior, and external part of the anterior annular ligament of the carpus, and almost always.from an expansion of the tendon of the abductor longus pollicis. It is a small, thin, flat muscle, passing out- wards and downwards, and inserted by a flat tendon into the outer side of the first phalanx of the thumb. A very narrow cellular line separates it on the inside from the flexor brevis, which is situated on the same plane. It is co- vered by the external palmar fascia, and it covers the opponens muscle, from which it is distinguished by the direction of its fibres, and by a thin inter- vening aponeurosis. Action. It draws the thumb forwards and inwards, and therefore might be termed the superficial opponens. From its attachments it might be called scaphoido-phalangal. The Opponens Pollicis. The opponens pollicis (r,figs. 119, 120.), a small triangular muscle, ai-ises from the trapezium, and the anterior and external part of the anterior an- nular ligament of the carpus, in front of the sheath of the flexor carpi radi- alis. From these origins, which are partly fleshy and partly tendinous, the fleshy fibres radiate downwards and outwards, the highest being the shortest and the most horizontal. They are inserted into the entire length of the outer border of the first metacarpal bone. This muscle is covered by the abductor brevis, which projects a little be- yond it on the outside, and from which it is separated by a more or less dis- tinct aponeurosis. It covers the first metacarpal bone and its articulation with the trapezium. Action. It draws the first metacarpal bone inwards and forwards, thus op- posing it to the others, as its name indicates. From its attachments it may be called trapezio-metacarpal.340 MYOLOGY. The Flexor Brevis Pollieis, It is difficult to point out the limits of this muscle, or rather they have hither- to been quite arbitrary. Its inferior attachment has been usually divided be- tween the external and the internal sesamoid bones (Boyer, TraiU d'Anatomie. torn. ii. p. 307.; Bichat, Anatomie Descriptive, torn. ii. p. 272.); but vre shall consider that portion only which is attached to the external sesamoid bone, as belonging to this muscle, referring the entire fleshy mass that is inserted into the internal sesamoid bone to the adductor poUicis.* This division is moreover established by the tendon (I, Jig. 120.) of the flexor longus poUicis. Proceeding then from below upwards, in the dis- section of the flexor brevis (,t,Jigs. 119, 120.), we shall see that it is triangular, much larger than the preceding two muscles, bifid above, and channelled in front. It arises by tendinous and fleshy fibres from a process on the trape- zium, from the lower edge of the annular ligament, from all the reflected portion of that ligament forming the sheath of the flexor carpi radialis and extending as far as the os magnum, and from the os magnum itself by a por- tion which is usually distinct. From these different origins the fleshy fibres proceed downwards and outwards, the internal being the most oblique; and, converging so as to form a thick fasciculus, are inserted, through the medium of the external sesamoid bone, into the first phalanx. Relations. It is covered by the external palmar fascia, which is prolonged in front of it: it covers the tendon of the flexor longus poUicis, and more internally those of the common flexor. It also covers a small portion of the outer border of the adductor poUicis, and the tendon of the flexor carpi radi- alis. Its outer border, or rather side, is in relation with the short abductor, from which it is easily separated, and with the opponens, sometimes being con- tinuous with it. Its inner border is distinct from the adductor below, but is confounded with it at its origin. Its tendon of insertion into the phalanx is covered by that of the short abductor, which lies externally to it. From its attachments it might be caUed trapezio-phalangal, and, from its uses and posi- tion, the opponens internus. Action. It is evidently not a flexor poUicis, but, like the preceding muscles, it draws the thumb forwards and inwards ; and it acts more decidedly in pro- ducing the latter efi"ect, because it is inserted in a more favourable manner than the other muscles. This, therefore, is also an opponens muscle. Muscle hiserfed into the Inner Side of the First Phalanx of the Thumb. The Adductor PoUicis. This is the largest of all the muscles of the thumb («, figs. 119, 120.); it is very irregularly triangular ; and arises from the entire extent of the ante- rior border of the third metacarpal bone, from the anterior surface of the os magnum, from the anterior and upper part of the trapezoides, from the ante- rior part of the trapezium by a tendinous and fleshy fasciculus, and from the palmar interosseous fascia near the third metacarpal bone. From these dif- ferent origins the fleshy fibres proceed, the lower horizontally, the rest more • The arranEement T have adopted Is founded upon the inferior attachments of the muscles; fnr at their orieins they are so blended that their division is more or less arbitrary.

Relations. Its inner two thirds are deeply situated, and covered by the tendons of the flexor profundus digitorum, by the lumbricales, and by an apo- neurosis, which, becoming continuous with the deep interosseous fascia, con- stitutes the sheath of the muscle. It is subcutaneous near its lower border. It covers the first two interosseous spaces, from which it is separated by a very strong aponeurosis. It is again subcutaneous behind, also along its lower border, which may be easily felt under the fold of skin, extending from the thumb to the index finger. Action. It is an adductor; it draws the thumb towards the median line or axis of the hand, represented by the third metacarpal bone. Muscles of the Hypothenar Eminence, or Muscles belonging to the Little Finger. These muscles correspond exactly to those of the thumb : the reason that three only are described is, that the one which represents the adductor of the thumb is situated in the fourth interosseous space, and is, therefore, classed with the interosseous muscles, to be hereafter described. All the muscles of the hypothenar eminence are inserted into the inner side of the first phalanx of the little finger, or into the third metacarpal bone. We find also a cuta- neous muscle in this region, viz. the palmaris brevis. The Palmaris Brevis. This is a very thin square muscle (caro qusedam quadrata, 6 118.) situ- ated in the adipose tissue covering the hypothenar eminence. It arises from the anterior annular ligament of the carpus, and the inner edge of the middle pabnar fascia, by very distinct tendinous fasciculi, succeeded by equally dis- tinct fleshy bundles, which pass horizontally inwards, and terminate in the skm. Relations. It is covered by the skin, to which it adheres intimately, espe- pecially by its inner extremity (le palmaire cutan^, Winslov}) ; it covers the muscles of the hypothenar eminence and the ulnar artery and nerve, from all of which it is separated by the internal palmar fascia. Action. It corrugates the skin over the hypothenar eminence. The Abductor Digiti Minimi.

This muscle is often wanting, but the fleshy fibres which usually constitute it are then always found in some measure blended with the other muscles. Action. It produces slFght flexion of the little finger. The Opponens Digiti Minimi. This muscle (f,Jig- 119.) is generally distinct from the preceding, and is the representative of the opponens pollicis. It arises from the hooklike process of the unciform bone, and from the contiguous part of the annular ligament: from these points the fibres proceed downwards and inwards (i. e. towards the ulnar border of the hand), the highest being the shortest and the most hori- zontal : they are inserted into the whole length of the inner or ulnar margin of the fifth metacarpal bone. Relations. It is covered by the preceding muscles and by the internal palmar fascia: it covers the fifth metacarpal bone, the corresponding inter- osseous muscle, and the tendon of the superficial flexor proceeding to the little finger. ... Action. It opposes the little finger to the thumb by drawmg it forwards and outwards. The iNTEROssEons Muscles. Dissection. Remove the tendons of the extensor muscles behind, and those of the flexor muscles in front, together with the lumbricales, preserving at the same time the digital insertions of these small muscles. Dissect and study the deep palmar fascia, a fibrous layer covering the interosseous muscles in the palm of the hand, which sends prolongations between the two kinds of these muscles and is inserted into the anterior borders of the metacarpal bones, m- closing each interosseous muscle in a proper sheath. After havmg studied the palmar and dorsal fascia, separate the bones of the metacarpus by tearmg their connecting ligaments, and the interossei will then be completely exposed The interossei, so named from their position, and distmguished from each other bv the numerical appellations, first, second, third, &c. are divided into palmar (p p p,fig. 123.) and dorsal (d d dd), according as they are situated nearer to the palm or to the back of the hand. They are also distmgoished into adductors and abductors of the fingers. wt, > There are two in each interosseous space, one occupying its dorsal, the other its palmar aspect; and as there are four interosseous spaces, it would seem that there should be eight interosseous muscles • nevertheless seven only are ad- mitted by modern tnatomists in consequence of the first palmar interosseous muscle which belongs to the thumb, being separately described as the adduc- tor pol icis. This separation is founded upon the pecuhar arrangement pre- sented by that muscle, which is not attached from the first to the second, hu extends from the first to the third metacarpal bone, an important fact, that pxnlains the great extent to which the thumb can be adducted. A mbiute description of the interosseous muscles would be both useless and tedious I shall content myself with pointing out their general conformation, inrl the law which regulates their arrangement. In takS r general view of the interrosseous muscles, they must be consi- dered with^regfrd to theadduction or abduction of the fingers : but Aese terms aerea '^"^'^e'"'^ , • reference to the axis of the skeleton, but to the must 1 i^s reS^^^^^ Passing through the third axis of the ^^^^-i'Jj^^j/'^^^'e Ser. This being admitted, all the dorsal343 THE DORSAL INTEROSSEI. extends from the third and fourth metacarpal bones to the inner or ulnar side of the phalanx of the middle fingers, and is also an abductor of the same, because it separates it from the supposed axis of the hand. The fourth extends from the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones to the inner or ulnar side of the first phalanx of the fourth finger, and it again is an abductor of that finger from the axis of the hand, although, as well as the preceding muscle, it is an adductor as regards the axis of the body. In order to render this view more intelligible, I have been accustomed to represent the five fingers by five lines (see diagram d), to prolong the middle line for the axis of the hand, and then to draw other lines (the four fine lines), representing the axes of the muscles ; the demonstration is thus rendered complete. In the same manner, all the palmar interossei are adductors as regards the axis of the hand. Thus the first, which is represented by the adductor pollicis, and extends from the third metacarpal bone to the inner or ulnar side of the first phalanx of the thumb, is an adductor as regards the axis of the hand as well as that of the body; the second, extending from the second metacarpal bone to the inner or ulnar side of the first phalanx of the index finger, is an adductor both as regards the axis of the hand and that of the body; the third, extending from the fourth metacarpal bone to the outer or radial side of the first phalanx of the ring finger, is an adductor as regards the axis of the hand; and lastly, the fourth, extending from the fifth metacarpal bone to the outer or radial side of the first phalanx of the little finger, is an adductor as regards the axis of the hand, but an abductor in reference to the axis of the body. A similarly constructed figure, as that employed for the dorsal interossei, will always keep this arrangement in the memory (see diagram p ; the four fine lines represent the axes of the palmar muscles). The general disposition of the interossei may be summed up in the following very simple law:—all the dorsal interossei have their fixed at- tachments/uriAer from the axis of the hand than their moveable one; all the palmar interossei have their fixed attachments nearer to the axis of the hand than their moveable one. We may now consider the general arrangement of these little muscles. T7ie Dorsal Interossei. These are short, prismatic, andtriangular muscles {diod,fig. 123.), extending li^^r J ^'s-123. from the two metacarpal bones, between which they i are placed, to the first phalanx and the extensor tendon of one of the corresponding fingers. They arise by a double origin, between which the perfo- rating arteries pass. But while one of these origins IS limited to the back part of the lateral surface of one of the metacarpal bones, the other occupies the whole length of the corresponding lateral surface of ^ 1^ ^ J" metacarpal bone. From this double origin V\ the fleshy fibres pass obliquely forwards round a tendon, which only emerges from them near the meta- carpo-phalangal articulation ; it then expands, and is and nartlv t„ ti,o , ^ P'"'*^^ *° "PP^"" «^ first phalanx anopartly to the outer edge of the corresponding extensor tendon. t!11 1 1ZZ^ interossei correspond behind with the dorsal surface of fin nnnr,^'''^ ^''^r^"" ^''"'^ ^^ich they are separated by a verv thin aponeurosis; m front, they are visible in thepahn of the hand by the sldZ of the palmar interossei, and, like the latter, are covered by the musol-s S tendons of the palmar region, being separated from those'par sTtt deepMYOLOGY. 844 palmar fascia. A distinct cellular line, or rather an aponeurotic septum, in- tervenes between one of their lateral surfaces and the corresponding pahnar interosseous muscle ; the other lateral surface is in relation through its entire length with the metacarpal bone on -which it is implanted. Action. These muscles are evidently abductors of the first phalanges of the fingers, the axis of the hand being taken as the point of departure. Their insertion into the extensor tendons explains why previous extension of the fingers is necessary to the movement of abduction. Theirs* dorsal interosseous muscle merits a special description. It is larger than the others, on account of the greater size of the space occupied by it; it is flat and triangular, and arises by two origins, separated not by a perforating branch but by the radial artery itself. A fibrous arch completes the half ring formed by the interval between the first two metacarpal bones for the passage of this artery. The external head of the muscle arises from the upper half of the inner border of the first metacarpal bone; the internal from the entire length of the external surface of the second metacarpal bone, and from the ligaments which unite it to the trapezium. From these points the fleshy fibres proceed, forming two thick bundles, which are perfectly distinct above, and converge to a tendon, that is attached to the outer side of the first phalanx of the index finger. Relations. It is covered behind by the skin; it corresponds m front to the adductor and flexor brevis pollicis, excepting below, -where it is subcutaneous. Its lower edge, directed obliquely downwards and inwards, is immediately subcutaneous, and crosses the corresponding edge of the adductor pollicis at a very acute angle. The Palmar Interossei. These, like the preceding, are short, prismatic, triangular, and penniform muscles. They are three in number ( p p p, fig. U3.) according to most authors, but four if we include the adductor poUicis. They all occupy the palm of the hand as their name indicates, and extend from the entire length of one of the metacarpal bones bounding the interosseous space in which they are situated, to the first phalanx of one of the corresponding fingers, and to its extensor tendon. They arise from about the anterior two thirds of the lateral surface of only one metacarpal bone; they are therefore covered behind by the dorsal inter- ossei which, being attached to the entire lateral surface of the other metacarpal bone', project equally into the palm. Lastly, their insertions into the phalanges and their extensor tendons correspond precisely withthoseof the dorsal interossei. Relations They are covered by the flexor tendons and by the muscles ot the palmar region : each is in relation behind with a dorsal interosseous muscle ; on one side, with the dorsal muscle of the corresponding finger ; and on the other, with the metacarpal bone from which it arises. Action They are evidently adductors, as regards the axis of the hand, ana, like the dorsal interossei, they bind down the extensor tendons ; they can only act effectually when the fingers have been previously extended. MUSCLES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. Thb muscles of the lower extremity may be arranged in four groups, vi.. those of the pelvis, of the thigh, of the leg, and of the foot. MUSCLES OF THE PELVIS. Action of these muscles. . , 1 \.f thp nplvis are divided into those occupying the posterior and Sre^c^^/inlttafi-gtn. The former are very numerous, consisting345 THE GLUTiEUS MA.XIMITS. of the three glutei, maximus, medius, and minimus, the Pyriformis, the ob- turator interfus, the gemelli, the quadratus femoris, and the obturator ex- The Uiacus, which may with propriety be considered as belonging to the pelvis, and as forming its anterior region, has been already described, together with the psoas, under the name of the psoas-iliac muscle. The GlutcBUS Maximus. Dissection. Having placed the subject on its face, raise the pelvis by a block, flex the leg forcibly, and rotate it inwards; then make an obhque in- cision along the middle of the buttock, from the sacrum towards the great trochanter, dividing both the skin and fascia covering the muscle : dissect up the two flaps, one from below upwards, the other from above downwards, fol- lowing the direction of the muscular fibres. The glutceus maximus {a, fig. 124.) is the most superficial of the muscles on the posterior aspect of the pelvis: it is broad, thick, and pretty regularly quadrilateral; it is the largest muscle of the human body—in this respect coinciding with the great size of the pelvis and femur in man ; it causes the prominence of the buttocks. Its great size is one of the most dis- tinctive characters of the muscular system of man, and has reference to his biped position. Attachments (see a, fig. 125.). It arises from the posterior semicircular line of the ilium, and the portion of the bone behind that line; from the vertical sacro-iliac ligament, and the outer mar- gin of the common aponeurosis of the posterior spinal muscles; from the crest of the sacrum, sometimes only from the tubercles which form a continuation of the transverse processes of the vertebrae on the outside of the posterior sacral foramina; from the edges of the coccyx, and the notch terminating the crest of the sacrum below, —this origin being often effected by means of a tendinous arch under which the last posterior sacral nerves pass; from the posterior surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament; and, lastly, from the posterior surface of the aponeurosis of the glutaeus medius. It is inserted (a,fig. 125.) into the rough line leading from the great trochanter to the linea aspera of the femur. The fleshy fibres arise either directly or by short tendinous fibres, and proceeding parallel to each other outwards, and a little downwards, unite into large distinct fasciculi, capable of being se- parated through their entire length and constitut- ing an extremely thick, quadrilateral, and very egular muscle, which, having reached the outside of the thigh, terminates by tendinous fibres. These are received between two layers of the fascia lata, which is here very thick; in passing downwards they converge, escape from the fascia lata, curve round the base of the great trochanter, or rather the tendon of the vastus extemus, from which they are separated by a synovial bursa, and are succes- sively inserted by so many large fasciculi into the series of tubercles and depressions, extending from the great trochanter to the linea aspera, and from the external bifurcation of that line. The lower fleshy fibres are attached di-'346 MYOLOGY. * See note, p. 389, rectly to tte linea aspera, and a certain number are inserted merely into the fascia lata. In order to obtain a good view of the femoral insertions of this muscle, its tendon must be separated from the fascia lata. Relations. It is covered by a large quantity of fat, bemg separated from it by an expansion from the aponeurosis of the glutseus medius, from which are given off the cellular prolongations that divide the muscle into thick, parallel, and easily separable fasciculi. It covers the gluteeus medius, the pyrifonnis, the gemelli, the obturator internus, the quadratus femoris, the great sciatic uotch, and the tuberosity of the ischium, together with the muscles attached to it, viz. the semi-tendinosus, the semi-membranosus, and the long head of the biceps. It covers also the great trochanter, the adductor magnus, and the triceps femoris, the glutaeal, ischi- atic, and internal pudic vessels and nerves, and the great sciatic nerves. Its upper border is very thin, and rests upon the glutaus medius ; its lower border forms a very marked prominence beneath the skin, that affords the surgeon very precise indications, both in the diagnosis of many diseases of the hip joint; in operations performed for the purpose of reaching the tuberosity of the ischium, -when it is either carious or necrosed; in those for the relief of sciatic hernia; or lastly, in searching for the sciatic nerve, whenever it be- comes necessary to operate upon it. Several bursse mucosse, which have been well described by Monro, separate the glutseus maximus from the eminences ■which are covered by it. One of these separates it from the great trochanter, and is almost always multi-locular : I have seen it filled with a sanguineous synovia. A second exists over the tuberosity of the ischium, but is often want- ing ; and a third between the tendon of this muscle and the vastus extemus.* Action. The glutseus maximus is an extensor, an abductor, and a rotator of the thigh outwards. "SVhen the femur is fixed, as in standing, it acts upon the pelvis, which it draws backwards and to its own side, and rotates so that the anterior surface of the trunk is turned to the opposite side. Besides this it is easy to see that the lower fibres can act as adductors. By its connections with the fascia lata it is one of the principal tensors of this structure; by its attach- ment to the coccyx it tends to prevent that bone from being thrown backwards, forwards, or to one side. The GlutcEus Medius. Dissection. Make a vertical incision through the middle of the glutseus maximus, or detach that muscle from the pelvis: remove the adipose tissue from the subcutaneous portion of the muscle, and also the fascia lata : dissect the tPHSor vagina femoris, which covers the anterior fibres of this muscle. The qlutcBus medius (6, figs. 124. to 127.) is intermediate to the other two elutEei both as regards size and position ; it is a broad, thick, radiated muscle, situated more deeply than the preceding, beyond which it projects upwards and forwards (fig 124.). The glutaeus maximus is attached to a small portion only of the iliac fossa: the glutsei medius and minimus share almost the whole of it ^^^AttMhme^. It arises from the whole extent of the curved triangular sur- face included hetween the superior semicircular line behind, the anterior three fourths of the crest of the ilium above, and the inferior semicircular line below; from the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the notch immediate y below if from the deep surface of a dense aponeurosis, which is inserted mto the outer lip of the crest of the ilium, covers all the upper portion of the muscle, and becomes continuous with the fascia lata: opposite the junction of the an- terior^ the middle third of the crest of the ilium, at which pomt a brge tubercle exists upon the bone, this aponeurosis is so dense as to resemble a iendon The muscle also arises from a deep aponeurosis, extending from the ZtvioT nart oT the inferior semicircular line, and giving attachment, on its txfernd s^fece, to a great number of fleshv fibres ; and lastly, from the fasciaTHE GLUTiEUS MINIMUS. 347 * Seo note, p. 38'J. •lata internally to the tensor vaginse femoris. It is inserted into the external surface of the great trochanter 125. 127.)- . ■,■ • ■ From these numerous origins the fleshy fibres proceed in different directions; the posterior forwards, the middle verticaUy, and the anterior backwards, be- coming more and more horizontal in front. They all terminate upon the two surfaces and edges of a radiated aponeurosis, the fibres of which are gradually concentrated and folded upon themselves, so as to form a flat tendon, inserted, not into the upper border, as it is generaUy said, but into the external surface of the great trochanter, along an oblique line ininning downwards and for- wards, so that the anterior fibres of the muscle are inserted into the anterior extremity of the lower border of the great trochanter, and the posterior fibres into the back part of the upper border ; at this latter point a well marked pro- jection sometimes exists, the size of which generally indicates the power of the glutaeus medius. A synovial bursa intervenes between the tendon and that part of the great trochanter over which it passes.* Relations. It is covered by the glutseus maximus, the tensor vaginse femoris, and the skin : it covers the glutseus minimus, with which its outer border is blended, and the glutaeal vessels and nerves. Its lower border is parallel with the pyriformis {Jig. 125.). Action. The glutEeus medius is both an extensor and an abductor of the thigh. Moreover, the anterior fibres rotate the femur inwards, and the posterior outwards; but the former have the greater power, for they are more numerous, the muscle being twice or thrice as thick in front as behind; it is therefore an extensor, an abductor, and a rotator inwards of the thigh, Winslow denies that it is an extensor, and considers it only as an abductor; this is only true in the position of standing upon both feet. In the sitting posture, again, this muscle in some degree loses its power as an extensor and abductor, and acts merely as a rotator. When the femur is fixed, as in standing, the glutseus medius extends the pelvis, draws it to its own side, and rotates it, so that the front of the trunk is turned towards the same side. It co-operates with the glutseus maximus in the first two motions, but antagonises.it in the last. Finally, its anterior fibres appear to me calculated to flex the thigh upon the pelvis; especially when the flexion has been already commenced by other muscles. The Glutceus Minimus. The gluteus minimus (c, Jig. 127.) is exposed by simply cutting across the preceding muscle, beneath which it lies; it is thinner and more regularly radiated. It arises from the anterior part of the crest of the ilium below the glutseus medius, from the outside of the sciatic notch, and from all that part of the external iliac fossa situated below the inferior semicircular line : from these points the fibres converge, the middle passing vertically, the posterior forwards, and the anterior backwards, to the deep surface of a radiated aponeurosis, the fibres of which are collected together into bands, that are in- serted separately into the anterior border and anterior half of the upper border of the great trochanter. Most commonly the posterior band is intimately attached to the tendon of the pyriformis. Relations. It is covered by the glutseus medius with which its anterior fibres are blended; it covers the external iliac fossa, the reflected tendon of the rectus femoris, and the upper part of the hip joint, from which it is separated by some fatty cellular tissue. Action. It is much more directly an abductor than the preceding muscles. Us anterior half rotates the thigh inwards, and its posterior half outwards. If the temur be fixed, it extends the pelvis, inclines it to its own side, and turns the anterior aspect of the trunk to the same side; by its anterior fibres it assists shghtly in producing flexion. General remarks upon the action of the glutai. The three muscles we haveMYOLOGY. S48 just examined, generally have their fixed points upon the pelvis ; and, in this point of view, are of the greatest importance in the standing posture. By their means the pelvis, firmly held down from hehind, is enabled to resist the effects of the weight of the trunk which tends to throw it forwards : hence the enormous developement of these muscles in man, evidently proving his destin- ation for the erect position. These same muscles are the principal agents in the position of standing upon one foot, inclining the pelvis to their own side, and balancing the entire weight of the opposite side of the trunk. They also rotate the trunk, when the individual is standing upon one foot. They are all extensors and abductors; the glutaeus maxim us is a rotator outwards ; the other two are rotators inwards. Hence we may understand how the thigh can be so powerfully rotated inwards, although there are no direct muscles for that purpose; while a great number are specially intended to produce rotation outwards, which movement, indeed, is performed much more ener- getically than rotation inwards. Tht Pyriformis. Dissection. Detach the glutaeus maximus, and separate the pyriformis from the lower border of the glutseus medius to which it is parallel. In order to see the sacral attachments of the muscle, make an antero-posterior section of the pelvis. . . a The pyriformis or pyramidalis {d,fig. 125.) is sometimes double: it is a tlat muscle of a pyriform or rather pyramidal shape, lying almost horizontally along the lower margin of the glutaeus medius, with which it seems to be con- tinuous, and is sometimes intimately united: it is partly situated in the cavity of the pelvis, and assists in filling up the sciatic notch. Attachments. It arises from the anterior surface of the sacrum (p, ^^.111.), in the intervals between the grooves forming the continuations of the an- terior sacral foramina, and also opposite those grooves by three or four digit- ations, which are sometimes traversed by the great sciatic nerve: these origins are sometimes concentrated into a smaU space around the second and third anterior sacral foramina. It also arises from the anterior surface of the ereat sacro-sciatic ligament, and from the upper part of the sciatic notch. It is inserted into the back part of the upper edge of the great trochanter. The fleshv fibres pass from their origins ahnost horizontally outwards and a little backwards, a^d form a muscle which fiUs up the upper part of the great sciatic notch and becoming much narrower immediately after emerging from the nelvis from the convergence of its fibres, terminates on the posterior surface and edges of an aponeurosis, which is afterwards converted mto a round tendon, and is fixed to the upper border of the great trochanter behind the glut^i^ Sm^, and above the gemelli and obturator intemus with which it is almost XSlurface is in relation with the rectmn the sciatic nlexus and the hypogastric vessels within the pelvis, and with the hip joint outS that cavity ; its posterior surface with the sacrum and the gluteus •?fn« itrunner margin with the gluteal vessels and nerves, which se- from thfglutrs'iedius; its l^wer margin with tbe ischiatic vessels «ml with the great and smaU sciatic nerves.

SI,?Svt'o'Se l-S^^- — «a direcU.. dike re- markable.THE GEMELLI, SUPERIOR ET INFERIOR. 349 * See note, p. 389. Attachments. It arises from the posterior surface of the obturator ligament, from the pelvic fascia lining the inner surface of this muscle, and from the tendinous arch which converts the sub-pubic groove into a canal; also, from the entire circumference of the obturator foramen, viz. from the internal surface of the descending ramus of the pubes and the ascending ramus of the ischium, and from the whole extent of the quadrilateral surface situated between the obturator foramen and the sciatic notch ; and lastly, by a few fibres from the brim of the pelvis. It is inserted into the digital cavity of the great trochanter. The fleshy fibres arise directly from this extensive surface, and converging downwards and outwards, pass out of the pelvis through a triangular opening formed by the spine of the ischium and lesser sacro-sciatic ligament above, by the great sacro-sciatic ligament on the inside, and by the body of the ischium on the outside. At its exit from the pelvis the muscle becomes much narrower, is reflected at a right angle over the body of the ischium as over a pulley, is next received into a groove formed for it by the gemelli, and proceeds horizontally outwards to be inserted into the digital cavity of the great tro- chanter below the pyriformis. In order to obtain a good view of the structure of this muscle. it must be detached from its insertion and turned inwards. We shall then perceive that the tendon divides into four or five diverging portions upon the deep surface of the muscle, which are lost in its interior. A well marked synovial membrane* intervenes between the tendon and the trochlear surface on the body of the ischium, which is covered with cartilage that is streaked, as it were, in the direction of the movements. Cowper and Douglas alluded to the presence of this bursa when they named the muscle marsupialis vel huraalis. Relations. In the pelvis the obturator internus is in relation with the ob- turator ligament and the circumference of the obturator foramen, by its anterior surface; and with the pelvic fascia and levator ani muscle, which separates it from the bladder, by its posterior surface. During its passage through the ori- fice I have described, it is in relation with the internal pudic vessels and nerves; externally to the pelvis, it is covered by the great sciatic nerve and the glutaeus maximus, and it covers the hip joint. From the great extent of the pelvic origins of this muscle, almost the whole of the anterior and lateral parietes of the pelvis are covered internally by a layer of muscular tissue j the posterior wall is also in a great measure covered by the pyriformis. The origins of the muscular fibres from the tendinous arch of the obturator ligament are so arranged, that the contraction of the muscle can have no effect in diminishing the size of the sub- pubic foramen intended for the passage of vessels and nerves. There are sometimes two small tendinous arches; one foi the nerve, the other for the artery and vein. TTie Gemelli, Superior et Inferior. The gemelli (gemim,Albinus; lespetits jumeaux, Winslow, f and g, Jig. 125.), two small fleshy fasciculi, accessories to the obturator internus, are generally distinguished by anatomists into the superior (/) and the inferior (g) ; they are separated from each other by the tendon of the obturator internus, for the reception of which they form a groove. Above and below this groove they take their origin, the superior from the spine of the ischium, and the inferior, which IS the larger, from the tuberosity of that bone immediately above the attachment of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, and even sUghtly from the liga- ™fi?

The gemellus superior is often wanting, and the inferior is fre- quently double. I have several times seen the superior terminate in the tendon of the pyriformis, and the inferior in the tendon of the obturator internus. Action.. They rotate the thigh outwards. Their relations with the synovial capsule of the obturator internus led to their being designated marsupiales by Cowper; and by Portal, le muscle capsulaire de la capsule du tendon de I'obtu- rateur interne. The Quadralus Femoris. This muscle (i, fig. 125.), shaped like a parallelogram, is situated immediately below the gemellus inferior. It arises from the external border of the tu- berosity of the ischium, in front of the semi-membranosus, from which it is separated by adipose tissue. From this point the fibres proceed horizontally outwards, parallel to each other, and are inserted into " an oblong ridge * pro- jecting partly from the back of the root of the great trochanter, and partly from the femur immediately below it;" but above the attachment of the adductor magnus, with which, at first, it appears to be continuous, but from which it is always separated by the internal circumflex vessels. This muscle is sometimes wanting; but very frequently its pelvic attach- ments are prolonged as far as the ascending ramus of the ischium; in which cases it is twisted inferiorly upon itself so as to oppose a surface, not a border, to the adductor magnus. Its relations behind are the same as those of the preceding muscles; in front, it covers the obturator externus and the lesser trochanter, from which it is often separated by a synovial capsule. The Obturator Externus, Dissection. The lower or horizontal portion of the obturator externus is exposed, by dividing the quadratus femoris into two equal parts by a vertical incision. In order to see the upper or pelvic portion, it is necessary to detach the gracilis, pectineus, psoas, iliacus, and adductor brevis. This is a triangular flat muscle (e, fig. 127.), of the same shape, but thinner and smaller, than the obturator internus, and like it reflected, though at an ob- tuse angle. It arises from the circumference of the obturator foramen, from the obturator ligament, and from the tendinous arch which completes the sub-pubic canal for the vessels and nerve. It is inserted into the deepest and lowest part of the digital cavity of the great trochanter. The fleshy fibres arise directly, the lower ones proceed horizontally outwards, and the upper obliquely downwards, backwards, and outwards; thus converging they form a fleshy belly which turns round the neck of the femur, and terminates in a tendon that passes horizontally outwards, to be inserted into the digital cavity below the gemelli and the obturator internus. Relations. Its outer and anterior surface is in relation with the pectineus, the adductors, the psoas and iliacus muscles, and more externally with the neck of the femur and the lower part of the capsular ligament of the hip joint. Its inner and posterior surface is in contact with the obturator foramen and the quadratus muscle. Action of the preceding Muscles. The last six muscles are evidently rotators of the thigh outwards. The pyri- formis the gemelli, and the obturator internus, which are ahnost always united at their insertions, would deserve the name of quadri-gemini, given by the older anatomists to the gemelli, the pyriformis, and the quadratus. When they take their fixed point upon the femur, as, for example, in standing upon one * rM Cruveilhier states the insertion of the quadratus femoris to be into the iiiter-trochan- teric line The description in the text, copied from Albinus, gives a more accurate idea of the insertion of this muscle.]THE BICEPS CRURIS. 351 foot, they become rotators of the pelvis, and turn the anterior surface of the trunk to the opposite side. They are only rotators when the limb is extended; in the sitting postui-e, they become abductors Winslow, who first demon-, strated their use in abduction in the semiflexed position, attached great importance to the connection of so many of these muscles with the capsular ligament, which he believed prevented pinching of the capsule during the 'different movements of the joint . . „ ,, t,t The insertion of these muscles is exceedmgly favourable. Moreover, we shall find that besides the glutaius maximus and the posterior fibres of the elutaius medius and minimus, they have many other muscles as accessories m rotation. The effects produced by the contraction of the two obturators can be easily understood, if we bear in mind that the action of a reflected muscle is to be calculated from the point of reflexion, leaving the rest of the muscle out of consideration. Thus, with regard to the obturator intemus, the sciatic notch acts as a pulley, and may be regarded as the fixed point. MUSCLES OF THE THIGH. The biceps cruris. — Semi-tendinosus. — Semi-membranosus. — Tensor vagince femoris. — Sartorius. — Triceps extensor cruris. — Gracilis. — Adductor muscles of the thigh. The muscles of the thigh are divided into those of the posterior region, viz. the biceps, the semi-tendinosus, and the semi-membranosus ; those of the external region, viz. the tensor vaginas femoris and the vastus extemus; those of the anterior region, viz. the sartorius, the rectus, and the triceps extensor cruris of authors; and lastly, those of the internal region, viz. the gracilis, the pectineus, and the three adductors. PosTEEioE Region. T/ie Biceps Cruris. Dissection. This is the same for the biceps, the semi-tendinosus, and the semi-membranosus. Place the subject upon its face, with a block under the pelvis, and allow the leg to hang over one side of the table. Make an incision from the middle of the space between the tuberosity of the ischium and the great trochanter, to the interval between the two condyles of the femur. Both the skin and the fascia of the thigh must be divided in this incision. Cau- tiously remove the cellular and adipose tissue suiToundingthe subjacent muscles, the relations of which with the popliteal vessels and nerves must be carefully studied. In preparing the superior attachments of these muscles, the gluteus maximus must be divided in the middle, perpendicularly to its fibres. The biceps femoris (biceps cruris, Albinus, I, figs. 124, 125.), so named be- cause it consists of two fleshy bodies or heads above, is a long large muscle, situated on the posterior and external aspect of the thigh. Attachments. It arises from the tuberosity of the ischium and the linea aspera of the femur ; and is inserted into the head of the fibula, and slightly into the external tuberosity of the tibia. Its origin from the ischium (I, fig. 125.) is common to it and the semi-tendinosus ; it takes place not from the tuberosity properly so caUed, but from the highest and most external part of the tube- rosity, above and behind the adductor magnus, and immediately below the gemeUus inferior. It arises by a tendon which is seldom completely free from muscular fibres. This tendon, at first very thick and separated from the tuberosity of the ischium by a synovial bursa, expands into an aponeurosis which gives origm to the fleshy fibres of the biceps by its external edge and posterior surface, and to those of the semi-tendinosus by its internal surface Lp to this point the biceps and semi-tendinosus are blended together so as to iorm a single fleshy belly, which, after extending from two to four inches is divided into two portions : one posterior and external, constituting the Zo«« W or ischial^ portion of the biceps; the other anterior, forming the origin of the semi-tendmosusrwhich we shall next describe. Arising thus in succtssion, the fleshy fibres of the long head of the biceps form a futiform belly passing XMYOLOGY. 352 Itquely downwards and a little outwards, and terminating on the anterior surfece of an aponeurosis which extends for a considerable distance on the posterior surface of the muscle, and which gradually becomes contracted so as to form the terminal tendon. Just where these fleshy fibres are about to terminate (Z, Jig. 125.), the aponeurosis receives upon its anterior surface and external edge the fleshy fibres of the short head, or femoral portion of the biceps. This por- tion of the muscle {V, fig. 125.) arises from the greater part of the interval between the two mar- gins of the linea aspera, and the posterior surface of the external inter-muscular septum of the thigh ; it passes downwards, inwards, and back- wards, to be attached to the' common tendon al- most as far as its insertion. This insertion is not confined to the head of the fibula, but extends also to the external tuberosity of the tibia by means of a strong division of the tendon, which, at the same time, gives off an expansion to the fascia of the leg. The insertion into the fibula is ef- fected on the outer side, in front of and behind the external lateral ligament of the knee joint, which ligament it embraces in a bifurcation. Relations. The biceps is covered by the glu- taeus maximus and the femoral fascia. It covers the semi-tendinosus, semi-membranosus, and vas- tus externus. It is in relation, also, with the great sciatic nerve, which is placed at first ex- ternally, then in front, and lastly on the inside of the muscle; finally, its short head is in relation with the popliteal vessels. The biceps forms the external border of the: popliteal space; near its termination it is in re- lation with the outer head of the gastrocnemius and with the plantaris longus muscle. Action. The biceps flexes the leg upon the thigh. When this movement is completed its long portion extends the thigh upon the pelvis. From its obliquity downwards and outwards, it rotates the leg outwards during semiflexion; but this rotation is impossible when the leg is extended, in consequence of the tension of the crucial ligaments. The fixed point of this muscle is as often below as above, and it then performs an important part in the mechanism of standing ; for it tends to prevent the in- dividual from falling forwards, because it holds back the pelvis. When the pelvis is thrown quite backwards, this muscle can then flex the thigh upon the leg. The Semi-tendinosus. The semi-tendinosus (m, figs. 124, 125.) so named on account of the great length of its tendon, is situated on the posterior and mternal aspect of the thigh. Attachments It arises from the tuberosity of the ischium, and is inserted into the anterior tuberosity of the tibia. Its origin (m fig 125.) consists of a tendon common to it and the long head of the biceps, which is prolonged m the form of an aponeurosis, upon the external (or popliteal) border of the muscle. Some of the fleshy fibres are attached directly to the tuberosity of the ischiuni. Having arisen in this manner, it enlarges and constitutes a fusiform buncUe, which passes at first verticaUy downwards and then obhquely inwards. About four or five fingers' breadth above the knee joint it termmates m aTHE SEMI-MEMBRANOSUS. 353 long thin tendon, which turns round the internal tuberosity of the tibia, de- scribing a curve having its concavity directed forwards, and is then reflected horizontaUy forwards to be inserted into the anterior tuberosity of that bone, behind the tendon of the sartorius, and paraUel with the lower edge of that of the gracDis to which it is united. The union of these three tendons constitutes the patte d'oie (goose's foot). . . » The length of its tendon of insertion is the most characteristic feature of the muscle; and hence its names, semi-nervosus {Spigelius), and le demi-nerveux ( Winslow'), for which, the term semi-tendinous has now been substituted. The structure of this muscle is remarliable. The fleshy fibres are interrupted across the middle by a tendinous intersection, analogous to that of the great complexus, which gives origin to new fleshy fibres. Relaticms. It is covered by the glutseus maximus and the femoral fascia, and it covers the semi-membranosus and part of the upper portion of the ad- ductor magnus. Its tendon is first placed behind the semi-membranosus, and then, before it turns round the internal tuberosity of the tibia, between the tendon of that muscle and the inner head of the gastrocnemius. Action. The same as that of the biceps. It is a very powerful flexor, on account of the reflexion of its tendon. Its oblique direction enables it to rotate the tibia inwards during semiflexion of the leg. It is, therefore, a con- gener of the popliteus. TTie Semi-membranosus. The semi-membranosus (n, figs. 124, 125.) is situated upon the posterior aspect of the thigh, thin and aponeurotic above, thick and fleshy below. Attachments. It arises from the upper and outermost part of the tuberosity of the ischium, in front of the biceps and semi-tendinosus; and is inserted into the internal tuberosity of the tibia, and also, by an expansion of its tendon, into the femur. It arises by means of a very thick tendon, which becomes wider immediately after its origin. From its inner border is given off an aponeurotic lamina, that splits into two layers from the interval between which the superior fleshy fibres arise. Lower down, the muscular fibres proceed directly from the tendon itself which runs along the outer (or po- pliteal) border of the muscle, as far as the lower fourth of the thigh, but is afterwards buried in its substance. The union of all these fibres constitutes a very thick four-sided fleshy belly, which is received into a tendinous semi- cone, open on its outer side, and soon becoming converted into a thick tendon, which, after a passage of a few lines, separates into three divisions, terminating in the following manner : —the posterior division passes inwards and upwards, formsL the chief part of the posterior ligament of the knee joint, and is inserted into the femur; the middle division is attached to the back of the internal tu- berosity of the tibia, below the articular surface; the third is horizontal, and turns round the internal tuberosity of that bone in the horizontal furrow existing there, and is inserted on the inner side of liie tuberosity. A synovial bursa intervenes between it and the bone. Relations. The semi-membranosus is covered by the glutseus maximus, the semi-tendinosus, the biceps, and the femoral fascia: it covers the qua- dratus femoris, the adductor magnus, and the inner head of the gastro- cnemius. A synovial membrane separates it from the knee joint. It also covers the popliteal artery and vein, which soon come into relation with its outer or popbteal border. The sciatic nerve lies parallel with its outer border through the whole of its extent; the gracilis is in contact with its inner border. I shall reniark here, that the biceps on the outside, and the semi-membranosus and semi- tendinosus on the mside, constitute the lateral boundaries of a cellular interval which extends along the whole of the back of the thigh, and is continuous with the popliteal space. This large ceUular interval communicates above with the VOL. I. ^ ^MYOLOGY. 354 cellular tissue of the pelvis at the sciatic notch, and below with the fossa of the ham. It is in this direction that purulent matter so readily escapes from the pelvis. The greater part of this interval is destined for the great sciatic nerve, which, however, is soon accompanied by the popliteal vessels. Actio7i. Precisely similar in nature to that of the preceding muscle, but much more powerful. The momentum of all these flexor muscles occurs, on the one hand, during semi-flexion of the leg upon the thigh; and, on the other (j. e. when their lower attachments are fixed), during semi-flexion of the thigh upon the pelvis. External Region. The Tensor VagincB Fenioris. Dissection. In order to expose this muscle, it is sufficient to make a vertical incision through the thick tendinous layer given off from the anterior portion of the crest of the Uium, and to dissect back the two flaps of that aponeurosis. The tensor vagina femoris (le muscle du fascia lata, o, fig. 126.) is the largest of all the tensor muscles of aponeuroses: it is a short, flat, quadrilateral muscle, contained vrithin the substance of the fascia lata, and occupying the upper third of the external region of the thigh. It arises from the anterior part of the outer margin of the crest of the ilium, and from the outer border of the an- terior superior spinous process of the ilium, between the sartorius and the glutseus medius, by means of a tendon which also furnishes some points of attachment to the anterior fibres of the last named muscle. From these points the fleshy flbres proceed downwards and a little backwards, and, at about the upper fourth or third of the thigh, terminate in a series of small tendinous bundles, the anterior of which become continuous with the fascia lata, while the posterior cross obliquely over the vertical fibres of the fascia, with -which they are very soon blended. Relations. It lies between two layers of the fascia lata, the external layer being much thicker than the internal. It is covered by the skin, and it covers the glutffius medius, the rectus, and the vastus extemus. Its anterior border is in contact with the outer edge of the sartorius, but is soon separated from it by a triangular space, in which the rectus femoris may be seen. Action. It is a tensor, not only of the entire femoral fascia, but particularly of the very dense portion or band of the fascia lata, which, being continuous with it may be regarded as an aponeurotic tendon to this muscle (muscle aponeurotique de la bande large, Winslow), and which is inserted into the outer tubercle of the anterior tuberosity of the tibia, and into the adjacent part of its external tuberosity. When the tensor vagina; is in action, this band com- presses the vastus externus, which has so great a tendency to displacement; by means of this band also the muscle acts upon and extends the leg. Lastly, as a rotator of the thigh inwards ; it is but httle concerned, however, m the production of this movement, which, as I have already said, is chiefly efl'ected by the anterior fibres of the glutsei medius and minimus. Anterior Region. The Sartorius. n;<,<,eciion This is common to all the muscles of the anterior and inner rerions of the thigh. Make a horizontal incision along the femoral arch, and another perpendicularly from the middle of that to the anterior tuberosity of tC tibia Dissect the fascia of the thigh with care.

If the vein should be opened, it must be tied above and below the.orifice, and then cut across. When the superficial muscles have been studied, they must be divided in the middle, in order to expose the muscles of the deep layers. The sartori^us (p, Jig. 126.), so named on account of its uses, crosses diagonally over the anterior and then the inner part of the thigh to the top of the leg. It is the longest muscle in the body, both as regards its total length, and more especially in reference to the length of its fibres ; whence the name of longus given to it by Riolanus. This is the case even although it be measured by a line stretched di- rectly between its two extremities. '■ Attachments. It arises from the anterior supe- rior spinous process of the Uium, from the upper half of the notch below that process, and from a tendinous septum between the muscle and the fascia lata. It is inserted into the inner margin of the crest of the tibia, situated beneath the liga- mentiun pateUee. Its origin consists of some ten- dinous fibres which are more marked behind and on the outer side than in front and within. The fleshy fibres commence almost immediately, and form a flat riband-like muscle (fascialis, Spigelius), which in reality is prismatic and triangular, as well as the tendinous sheath in which it is en- closed. The muscle increases in breadth as far as the lower third of the thigh, and passes ob- liquely downwards, inwards, and a little back- wards; it becomes internal and vertical at the lower third {p, figs. 124, 125.), and reaches the back part of the inner condyle of the femur, to turn round the knee joint, tendinous fibres having already commenced on the anterior edge of the muscle. The fleshy fibres terminate precisely where the muscle changes its direction to pass for- wards. The flat tendon by which they are suc- ceeded is at first narrow, but becomes considerably . expanded, to be inserted into the crest of the tibia, m tront of the tendons of the semi-tendinosus and gracilis muscles, with which It IS united, so as to form what is called thepatte d'oie (goose's foot). A synovial membrane separates it from the tendons of these muscles. A considerable tendinous expansion is given ofi' from its lower edge, and contributes to form the inner part of the fascia of the leg. Relations The sartorius is the most superficial muscle in the anterior aspect of the thigh: it lies beneath the feboral fascia, and covers the psoas ana macus, the rectus, the vastus internus, the adductor longus, the gracilis, the adductor magnus, and the internal lateral ligament of the knee joint.

In the middle third of the thigh, the ar- tery IS in relation, farst, with the inner border, then with the posterior surface366 MYOLOGY. and lastly with the outer border of the muscle. In the lower third, the sar- torius occupies a deep groove, formed by the gracilis and vastus internus; from the latter muscle it is separated below by an interval containing adipose tissue, of which circumstance advantage may be taken in the application of issues. It also covers the saphenus nerve (a deep branch of the anterior crural), which emerges from beneath its anterior border, opposite the lowermost point of insertion of the adductor magnus. Near the knee joint, the saphena vein is in relation with the posterior border of the muscle. The structure of the sartorius is very simple. The fleshy and tendinous fibres are all parallel, and the former correspond exactly with the length of the muscle. Action. The sartorius flexes the leg upon the thigh, which it draws in- wards, so as to cross one leg over the other. When this movement is pro- duced, it flexes the thigh upon the pelvis. If the fixed point of the muscle be at the leg, it then flexes the pelvis upon the thigh, and rotates it, so that the anterior surface of the trunk is directed to the opposite side. The Rectus Femoris and Triceps Extensor Cruris, or the Triceps Femoralis. I have included under the name triceps femoralis the two muscles, or rather the two parts of the same muscle, which are described separately in most anatomical works. The reasons for this arrangement will be understood after the following description of the muscle: — I shall consider the triceps femoralis as composed of three portions viz. a middle or long portion, the rectus femoris of authors : an external and an in- ternal portion, which constitute together the triceps cruris of authors; for these I shall retain the names of vastus internus and externus, including in the former the middle portion or crureus, properly so called, of most anatomists. The long portion of the triceps femoralis, or the rectus femoris (r,fig. 126.), is situated in the anterior region of the thigh, extending from the anterior in- ferior spinous process of the ilium to the patella: it is vertical in its direction, thick and broad in the middle, and narrower at its extremities. It arises by a very strong tendon (,r,Jig. 127.), which embraces the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium, and is proportioned to the power of the muscle. This tendon receives on its outer side another flat tendon, arising from a groove upon the rim of the cotyloid cavity, and following its curvature: this is the reflected tendon, which is blended with and strengthens the straight tendon. It then expands into a broad aponeurosis, the outer portion of which is very thin and prolonged over the anterior surface of the muscle as far as the middle, while the inner portion is very thick, and penetrates into its sub- stance nearly as far as its insertion. The fleshy fibres arise from the pos- terior surface and edges, and also from the anterior surface of the mner portion of this aponeurosis; they aU pass downwards and backwards, the internal inwards and the external outwards, and form a fleshy beUy, which increases as it proceeds downwards, and then terminates on the anterior surface of a broad, thick, and shining aponeurosis, occupying the lower two thirds of the posterior surface of the muscle, and soon becoming contracted into a flat tendon, which receives upon its inner edge the superficial fibres of the vastus internus, again expands, and is finaUy blended with the common tendon of the two vasti. rp. • „ ,„> Triceps femoris of authors, or vastus internus and externus. 1 his is a vo- luminous mass of muscular tissue, situated behind the preceding muscle, and extending from the three surfaces of the shaft of the femur to the patella and tibia It is commonly but erroneously considered to be divided above into three heads which are described under the names of vastus internus, vastus ex- ternus, and crureus. I have searched in vain for the middle portion, tut have never been able to find more than two separate parts ; one external, very largeTHE TRICEPS FEMORALIS. 357 and superficial, viz, the vastus externus; the other internal, anterior, and even external, viz. the vasttis interims : it is much smaller than the vastus externus, and is partly covered by it and by the rectus. The external portion or vastus externus (5, figs. 124. to 127.). . This is the largest portion of the triceps femoralis. It arises from a projecting border or horizontal crest, situated at the base of the great trochanter, and from a ver- tical edge in front of that trochanter, which forms a continuation of its an- terior border, and sometimes presents a very prominent tubercle: in the angle formed by these two attachments is situated the tendon of the glutaeus medius. It also arises along a line running from the great trochanter to the linea as- pera; and from the whole extent of the external lip of the linea aspera itself. All the preceding origins are effected by means of a broad aponeurosis which covers the superior three fourths of the muscle, and from the deep sur- face of which almost all the fleshy fibres proceed. Lastly, some of these arise from the tendon of the glutaeus maximus, and from the tendinous septum in- tervening between the vastus externus and the short head of the biceps. From these origins the fleshy fibres proceed, some vertically downwards, the others somewhat obliquely downwards and forwards, the lowest being the shortest and the most oblique ; they form a large bundle, which partiaOy covers the an- terior portion of the vastus intemus, but is separated from it by vessels, nerves, and cellular tissue. After a course of variable length, some of the fleshy fibres are attached to the deep, but the greater number to the superficial, surface of another equally strong aponeurosis: this becomes thickened and contracted into a flat tendon, which is sometimes divided into thick parallel bands, emerges from the fleshy fibres at the external margin of the rectus, and is in- serted into the outer half of the upper border of the patella, being blended on the inner side with the rectus and the vastus intemus. The lower fleshy fibres which arise from the inter-muscular septum are attached directly to the outer border of the patella.* The internal or anterior portion, vastus intemus (t and u, fig. 127.), is much smaller than the external, and surrounds the femur. Its inner portion lies im- mediately under the fascia, and is the only part which is generally described as the vastus internus (t,figs. 126. 127.). Its anterior portion is covered by the rectus, or long portion, and is usually called the crureus (cruralis, Alb., u, fig. 127.) Its outer portion is covered by the vastus externus, with which many of its fibres are blended ; but they may always be separated by cutting along the outer margin of the middle aponeurosis. Thus defined, the vastus intemus arises from a rough oblique line, extending from the front of the neck of the femur to the linea aspera, and from the internal lip of the linea aspera itself, in front of the adductor muscles : both of these origins are efi'ected bv means of an aponeurosis, which is weaker and smaller than that of the vastus ex- ternus, and is blended with that of the adductors, concurring with it in the formation of a canal for the femoral artery. It also arises from almost the whole of the intemal, anterior, and external surfaces and from the two anterior borders of the femur; lastly, the lower fibres arise from the internal inter- muscular septum. From these different origins, the fleshy fibres pass in various directions; the external inwards, the middle vertically, and the intemal, wh:ch are the most numerous, downwards, forwards, and outwards; they thus torm a fleshy belly, thicker below and within, than above and without, and are successively attached to both surfaces, and especiaUy to the posterior surface ot a broad aponeurosis, which is covered by the tendon of the vastus externus, but can be easily separated from it. The inner fibres are attached to the anterior surface of the aponeurosis, and terminate very regularly opposite a vertical line, running parallel to the inner margin of the rectus femoris. ihe aponeurosis extends over the anterior surface of the middle portion of rectu^I'Xch"l°ine7bfk^n\'S'"''r '^f^^^-perfectly di.stinct from the tendon of the lus, wnicn 18 lined by it; and also from the expanded tendon of the vastus intemus A A 3353 MYOLOGY. the muscle, which lies behind the rectus : this fact has doubtless given rise to its division into two parts, viz. a middle or the crureus, and an internal called the vastus internus. The superficial layer of the internal fleshy fibres is attached below to the inner margin of the rectus, or long portion of the triceps femoralis: the lowest of these fibres, which arise from the inner and inferior bifurcation of the linea aspera, and from the corresponding inter-muscular septum, are almost horizontal, and accompany the tendon as far as its insertion into the inner border of the patella. Lastly, the terminating aponeurosis is prolonged in- wards to the internal tuberosity of the tibia, below which it is inserted, being covered by the tendons of the semi-tendinosus, semi-membranosus, and gracilis muscles, on the inner side of the internal lateral ligament of the knee. This very strong aponeurotic insertion represents the fascia lata on this aspect of the limb, and forms an accessory internal lateral ligament. From the above description it follows, that the triceps femoralis is composed of three muscles and three tendons, super-imposed upon each other, viz. the rectus femoris, the vastus extemus, and the vastus internus. Relations. The long portion of the triceps, or the rectus femoris, is covered by the fascia lata in its lower three fourths. Its upper part is covered by the sartorius, by the anterior fibres of the glutseus medius, and by the psoas and iliacus. It covers the hip joint, the anterior circumflex vessels, and the two vasti muscles. The vasti surround the femur as in a muscular sheath, and have relations with all the muscles of the thigh. They are superficial in a great part of their extent: in front, they are in relation with the psoas and iliacus, the rectus femoris, and the sartorius, and they lie immediately under the fascia, in the triangular spaces left between these muscles: behind, they are in relation with the biceps and semi-membranosus; on the inside, with the adductors, with the femoral artery, the sheath of which the vastus internus contributes to form, and with the sartorius; on the outside, with the gluteus maximus, which glides over the upper end of the vastus extemus, and is separated from it by a synovial bursa; and lastly, with the tensor vagina; femoris and the fascia lata. It is necessary to allude here to a small fleshy bundle, formed by the deepest and lowest fibres of the vastus internus, which is always distmct from the rest of the muscle, and is inserted into the upper part of the synovial membrane of the knee. This bundle has been regarded by Wmslow as an articular muscle, intended to prevent the synovial membrane from being pinched between the surfaces of the joint. . • ^ -i- Action. This muscle extends the leg upon the thigh ; its action is tacili- tated by the existence of the patella, which serves to mcrease the angle ot insertion, and which we have described as a sesamoid bone, developed in the substance of the tendon. We must, therefore, regard the triceps as inserted into the anterior tuberosity of the tibia, or rather into th? lower part oi that tuberosity. It should be observed, that the tendon is inserted into the patella, in front of its base, and not into the base itself in the same manner as the lieamentum patellse is attached to the anterior surface of that bone, and not to the rouffh mark on its posterior surface: this important arrangement increases the angle at which the moving power operates. The triceps femorahs is the most powerful muscle in the body, no other havmg such large sm-faces of Snf and consequently so great a number of fibres. By itse^ it supports m a stafe of equilibriiim, the entire weight of the body m standing, and may be adduced al a striking example of the predominance of the extensors over the flexor it is also this muscle which raises the whole trunk m progression and in thl act of leaping.

Professor Ant. Dubois has in- formed me of an individual whose knees were bent very much inwards, who could not contract the triceps femoralis with any force without dislocatmg the patella outwards. Internal Region of the Thigh. The muscles of the internal region of the thigh are the gracilis and the adductors, among which I include the pectineus. The Gracilis. The gracilis (le grele interne, ou droit interne, Winslow, v,figs.. 124, 125,126.; is a long, straight, and slender muscle, and the most superficial of those situ- ated on the inside of the thigh. Attachments. It arises from the symphysis pubis, between the pubic spine and the ascending ramus of the ischium, and is inserted into the spine of the tibia. It arises by some long, shining, and parallel tendinous fibres, which bind down a perpendicular fibrous bundle that lies on the inner side of the line of attachment. The fleshy fibres succeeding to these are at first parallel, and form a broad thin bundle; they then converge towards each other, so that the entire muscle resembles a much elongated isosceles triangle. It is rounded below, and terminates in a long thin tendon, which runs for a considerable distance upon its posterior border, and receives all the fleshy fibres in succes- sion. This tendon becomes free immediately above the knee joint, is then situated behind the internal condyle of the femur, turns round this process and the corresponding tuberosity of the tibia, and is inserted into the spine of the last mentioned bone, behind the tendon of the sartorius, and above that of the semi-tendinosus, with both of which it is united so as to form the trifid aponeurotic interlacement, denominated la patte d'oie (goose's foot). Relations. The gracilis is covered by the femoral fascia, and slightly by the sartorius at its lower part: it covers the three adductors, the inside of the knee joint, and the internal lateral ligament, from which it is separated by a sy- novial bursa common to it and the semi-tendinosus : the vena saphena interna crosses the inner surface of this muscle obliquely, near its lower extremity. Action. It flexes the leg, and carries it slightly inwards at the same time by means of its reflection round the knee ; in this part of its action it assists the sartorius ; it also adducts the thigh. In the position of standing its move- able point is at the pelvis. The Adductor Muscles of the Thigh. There are three muscles on the inner aspect of the thigh which are called adductors, with these the older anatomists were acquainted under the collective name of the triceps adductor. Modern writers, however, describe them either in the order of their super-imposition, as the first, second, and third {Boyer); or in the order of their size, as the middle, small, and great adductors {Bichat). These vague denominations are the source of mucli confusion, for tlie one which occupies the middle place as regards size is the first as regards its po-MYOLOGY. 360 sition. I haye therefore thought it right to modify these names, and have at the same time included the pectineus among the adductor muscles. I consider therefore that there are four adductors, which I shall divide into superficial and deep; the two superficial are the pectineus and the first or long adductor; these I shall term the first and second. Superficial adductors. The two deep are the short and the great adductors, which 1 shall denominate the small deep adductor, and the great deep adductor. Strictly speaking we could only admit the existence of two adductors, one su- perficial, the other deep; and this mode of division would perhaps he preferahle. Dissection. This is common to all the adductors. Ahduct the thigh so as to render these muscles tense. Make an incision through the integuments from the middle of the femoral arch to the patella, and a semicircular incision at either end of this; preserve the vessels and nerves in order to examine their relations; tie and cut across the vena saphena where it enters the femoral vein ; divide the fascia lata, and dissect the muscles, which will then he brought into view. TTie First Superficial Adductor, or Pectineus. The pectineus (pecten, the pubes) is a square iv\^»g-127. muscle (w, fig. 126.), situated at the upper anterior and inner aspect of the thigh, on the inner side of the psoas and iliacus (c). Attachments. It arises (to, fig. 127.) from the spine and crest of the pubes, from the triangular surface in front of this crest, and from the lower surface of a very strong tendinous and arched pro- longation of Gimbemat's ligament, which is at- tached to the crest of the pubes, and is continuous with the fascia covering the muscle. It is inserted (w,fig. 127.) below the lesser trochanter, into the ridge extending from that process to the linea aspera. With the exception of the spine of the pubes, where there are always some weU. marked tendinous attachments, the fleshy fibres commence directly from the several origins: they proceed downwards, backwards, and outwards, and con- stitute a bundle which is at first flattened from be- fore backwards, and afterwards from without in- wards : the fibres of this after a short course converge, and are inserted into the internal bifur- cation of the linea aspera, in part directly, and partly through the medium of an aponeurosis which occupies the anterior surface of the muscle. Relations. The pectineus is covered by the deep layer of the femoral fascia and by the femoral vessels. It covers the capsular ligament of the joint, the small deep adductor, and the obturator extemus, from which it is separated by the obtu- rator vessels and nerves. Its outer border is pa- rallel with the inner border of the conjoined por- tions of the psoas and Lliacus, and is separated from them by a cellular interval, over which the femoral artery passes; so that were it not for the projection of this outer border, this vessel would be in im- mediate contact with the bone. Its inner border is in relation with the second superficial adductor, and is sometimes blended with it except below, where it is separated by an interval in which the smaU deep adductor may be se ;seen. It has361 THE ADDUCTOR MAGNUS. an important relation with the anterior orifice of the sub-puhic canal, which corresponds with the posterior surface of the muscle. AVhen hernial pro- trusions therefore take place at the foramen ovale the displaced parts are always covered by the pectineus muscle. The Second Superficial Adductor, or Adductor Longus. The adductor longus of Albinus (le premier adducteur, Boi/er; le moyen ad- ducteur, Bichat, x,fig. 126.) is a flat triangular muscle, situated on the same plane as the pectineus, of which it seems to be a continuation, and with which it is often blended above. For this reason Vesalius made of these two muscles his eighth pair of muscles of the thigh, under the name of pars octava femur moventium. It is certain that there is a sort of consolidation between these two muscles, and that a small pectineus is always observed in conjunction with a large adductor longus. Attachments. It arises Qc,fig. 127.) from the spine of the pubes, and is in- serted (x) into the middle third of the linea aspera of the femur. Its origin consists of a narrow flat tendon, which expands anteriorly, and gives origin to a thick and broad fleshy belly; this passes downwards, backwards, and outwards, and is inserted into the middle third of the linea aspera of the femur, between the triceps femoralis in front, and the great deep adductor behind: with the latter of these muscles it becomes blended at its insertions. It is at- tached to the bone by means of two tendinous layers, beween which the fleshy fibres are received. A number of foramina, intended for the perforating ar- teries, are observed in the neighbourhood of this attachment. Relations. Its upper part lies immediately under the fascia, and it becomes gradually deeper as it passes downwards. It is in relation with the sartorius, from which it is separated by the femoral artery and veins. This relation is one of great importance, as I shall hereafter have occasion to point out. The Small Deep Adductor, or Adductor Brevis. The adductor brevis of Albinus (le second of Boyer; le petit of Bichat, y,fig 127.) is of the same form as the preceding muscle, and is the second in the order of super-imposition, but the smallest in size. It arises below the spine of the pubes on the outer side of the gracilis, and the inner side of the obturator ex- temus from a variable extent of surface. The fibres proceed outwards, down- wards, and a little backwards, and form a thick bundle, at first flattened from within outwards, and then from before backwards, which increases in breadth, and terminates at the middle of the linea aspera of the femur, in front of the great deep adductor, and behind the two superficial adductors, with which it is blended at its insertion. Relations. It is covered by the superficial adductors, and it covers the great deep adductor, or adductor magnus. Its outer border has a relation with the obturator extemus, and the conjoined psoas and iliacus muscles; its inner border is at first in contact with the gracilis, and is then applied to the ad- ductor magnus, from which it is sometimes difficult to separate it. The Great Deep Adductor, or Adductor Magnus. Dissection. In order to obtain a good view of this muscle, it is not sufficient to study its anterior surface only, which is exposed after the preceding muscles have been divided; its posterior surface must also be examined; and for this pur- pose it is necessary to remove the three muscles of the posterior region of the thigh, viz. the biceps, the semi-tendinosus, and the semi-membranosus. The adductor magnus o{ Albinus (le troisicme of Boyer; le grand of Bichat, 2 z'. Jigs. 124. to 127.) is a very large triangular muscle, extremely thick in- ternally, where it constitutes almost the entire substance of the inside of theMYOLOGY. 362 thigh (^Jig. 127.). It arises from the whole extent of the ascending ramus of the ischium, from a small part of the descending ramus of the pubes, and from the apex, i. e. the lowest portion, of the tuberosity of the ischium. It is inserted into the whole extent of the interval between the two lips of the linea aspera, and into a very prominent tubercle upon the inner condyle of the femur, above the depression for the insertion of the tendon of the inner head of the gastrocnemius. Its origins, especially those from the ischium, which are the principal, can only be seen on the posterior surface of the muscle (see Jig. 125.). They consist of tendinous bundles, giving origin im- mediately to fleshy fibres, which form an extremely thick mass, directed downwards and outwards, and presenting coarse bundles, almost as large and as easily separable as those of the glutaeus maximus. The muscle soon divides into two portions, or rather into two distinct muscles—an internal and an external. The internal portion (2, Jigs. 125. 127.) forms the inner border of the ad- ductor magnus, the original course of which it foUows. About the lower third of the thigh, its fibres are received into a tendinous semi-cone, open on the outside, and terminating in a shining tendon, which is inserted into a well marked tubercle on the upper and back part of the internal condyle of the femur. Throughout its whole course, this tendon lies close to the aponeurosis of the vastus internus. The external portion (2', Jig. 125.) abandoning the primitive direction of the muscle, is directed outwards, and separates into thick bimdles, which are in- serted into the whole extent of the interval between the lips of the linea aspera, by means of a very large aponeurosis, which is intimately united to the tendons of the other adductors, and forms a series of arches (see Jig. 125.) for the pas- sage of the perforating arteries. These two divisions of the adductor magnus are separated below by the femoral artery and veins and their sheath, and are generally distinct for a con- siderable extent, and sometimes entirely so. 1 have met with a case of this kind. That portion of the muscle which was inserted into the internal con- dyle arose entirely from the apex of the tuberosity of the ischium ; whilst the origin of that portion which was attached to the linea aspera, took place from a prominence situated on the external side of that tuberosity, and pro- jecting outwards from it, and also from the ascend^g ramus of the ischium, and the descending ramus of the pubes, externally to the gracilis muscle. The superior fibres (^Jig. 125.) are horizontal, and forming a distinct and, as it were, a .radiated bundle, turn in front of the succeeding fibres, and are inserted into the line leading from the great trochanter to the linea aspera internally to the glutsBus maximus. Relations. The adductor magnus is covered by the superficial adductors and by the small deep adductor : it covers the semi-tendinosus, the biceps, the semi-membranosus, and the glutaeus maximus. Its inner border is bounded by the gracilis above, and by the sartorius below : its upper border is in contact with the obturator externus (e,Jig. 127.) on the inside, and with the quadratus femoris (i,fig. 125.) more externally. Its most important relation is that with the femoral artery and vein, which pass through it before reaching the pop- liteal space At the place where this perforation occurs, we observe a ten- dinous arch, or rather canal, into which the fleshy fibres are inserted; and so, also, where the perforating arteries pass through this muscle. Action of the adductor muscles. The muscles we have just described are both flexors and rotators outwards; but their principal office, as their name indicates, is to perform adduction, a very energetic movement as might be anticipated from the strength of the muscles concerned m its production. M e have seen, indeed, that the line of origm extends from the il»o-Fctine^ eminence, as far as and including the tuberosity of the ischimn; and ^at the insertions occupy the entire length of the hnea aspera, the two branches of its uperS bif^^^^^^^^ and the inner condylo of the femur. These muscles are363 THE TIBIALIS ANTICUS. powerfully exerted diiriug equestrian exercise; it is by their means that the horse is fii-mly grasped between the knees. The two superficial adductors and the adductor brevis are also flexors, because their insertions are posterior to their origins. All the adductors are, as it were, rolled around the femur during rotation inwards. MUSCLES OF THE LEG. The tibialis anticus.—Extensor communis digitorum.—Extensor propriuspollicis. — Permmis longus and brevis. — Gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus. — Popliteus. — Tibialis posticus. —Flexor longus pollicis. The muscles of the leg may be divided into those of the anterior, those of the external, and those of the posterior regions. Muscles of the Anterior Kegion of the Leg. The muscles of the anterior region of the leg are the tibialis, the extensor communis digitorum, and the extensor proprius pollicis pedis. The anterior peroneus, or peroneus tertius, when it exists, is nothing more than an accessory fasciculus of the extensor communis. The Tibialis Anticus. Dissection. Make a vertical incision through the skin trom tne anterior tuberosity of the tibia to the middle of the inner border of the foot; dissect back the two flaps of skin, and expose the fascia of the leg; divide this fascia vertically, commencing from the middle of the leg, and terminating at the lower end of the tibia, taking care to preserve the annular ligament: prolong the dissection and separation of the fascia as far upwards as possible ; lastly, remove the fascia on the dorsum of the foot, which covers inferiorly the tendon of the tibialis anticus. The tibialis anticus (a, fig. 128.) is a long, thick, prismatic, and triangular muscle, placed superficially along the outer side of the tibia. Attachments. It arises from the crest which bounds the anterior tuberosity of the tibia on the outside, and from the tubercle terminating this crest above; from the external tuberosity of the tibia, and the superior two thirds of its external surface, which presents a depression proportioned to the strength of the muscle; from all that portion of the interosseous ligament situ- ated to the inner side of the anterior tibial vessels and nerves ; from the deep surface of the fascia of the leg; and lastly, from a tendinous septum intervening be- tween this muscle and the extensor communis digit- orum. It is inserted into the tubercle on the first or internal cuneiform bone, and sends off a tendinous expansion to the first metatarsal bone. It arises from the internal surface of an osteo-fibrous ' quadrangular pyramid formed by the tibia, the fascia of the leg, the interosseous ligament, and the inter- muscular septum; from these points the fleshy fibres proceed vertically downwards, and terminate around a tendon which commences in the substance of the muscle above its middle third; the anterior fibres cease at the lower third of the muscle, the posterior accompany the tendon to the point where it passes under the dorsal ligament of the instep (seen in fig. 128.). As soon as the tendon appears on the anterior border of the muscle, it is deflected forwards in a similar manner to the external surface of the tibia, and follows the same ob- Ftg m.364 MYOLOGY. lique course, after having left the common sheath of all the muscles of the anterior region of the leg. Another sheath, which is nothing more than the condensed dorsal fascia of the foot, receives the tendon at the point where it passes vertically downwards, to be inserted into the tubercle of the first cunei- form bone. Relations. The tibialis anticus is covered by the fascia of the leg and the dorsal fascia of the foot; on the inside it is in relation with the external surface of the tibia; on the outside, at first with the extensor communis digitorum, and then with the extensor proprius pollicis, from which it is separated behind by the anterior tibial vessels and nerves. Action, It flexes the foot upon the leg ; and from the obliqmty of its tendon it raises the internal border of the foot, and consequently produces that sort of rotation inwards at the articulation of the two rows of the tarsus which we &ave already alluded to. It tends also to adduct the ankle joint, and is con- sequently opposed to dislocation outwards. The absence of a proper sheath for this muscle, explains the considerable projection formed by its tendon during contraction, which may serve as a guide to the preliminary incisions in liga- ture of the dorsal artery of the foot. Spigelius called this muscle the musculus catenee, because fetters applied around the ankles of criminals press chiefly upon the projection formed by its tendon. The Extensor Longus Digitorum Pedis, and the Peroneus Tertius vel Anticus. Dissection. Remove the fascia of the leg and the dorsal fascia of the foot. This is an elongated, semi-penniform, and reflected muscle (be. Jig. 128.), flattened from within outwards, single above, and divided into four or five tendons below. Attachments. It arises from the external tuberosity of the tibia, on the outer side of the tibialis anticus ; from the whole of the internal surface of the fibula in front of the interosseous ligament, and slightly from that ligament; from the upper part of the fascia of the leg, and from the tendinous septa interposed be- tween this muscle and the tibialis anticus within, and the peroneus longus and brevis without. It is inserted into the second and third phalanges of the last four toes. . •,• • From these numerous origins the fleshy fibres proceed m different directions; the superior vertically downwards, the rest obliquely downwards and forwards, the lowest being the most oblique ; they all terminate around a tendon, which appears upon the anterior border of the muscle below the upper third of the leg. This tendon soon divides into two portions : one internal, and itself sub- divided into three tendons for the second, third, and fourth toes; the other external, and generally split into two tendons, one of which is intended for the flfth toe,'while the other is flxed to the posterior extremity of the correspond- ing metatarsal bone. This last subdivision is often wanting; it is but im- perfectly separated from the fasciculus belonging to the fifth toe, to which it almost always sends off an accessory tendon : it has been generaUy described as a separate muscle, under the name of the peroneus tertius or anticus ic,fg. 128.). I have thought it right, however, to connect this muscle with the extensor longus digitorum (6), from which it can be so imperfectly separated that it has been designated by Cowper, pars extensoris digitorum pedis longi; and by Morqagni, quintus tendo extensoris longi digitorum pedis .... ^ . The extensor communis is directed vertically as far as the ankle jomt, where it enters a sheath common to it and the fle*er-proprius polhcis, is next re- flected under this sheath, becomes horizontal, passes obhquely inwards and opposite the tarsus, is received into a much stronger proper sheath after leavmg which the five tendons separate so as to cover the dorsal surface of the meta- Tar ^ bone of the toes, to which they correspond. In this course they cross he extensor brevis dig torum at a very acute angle, reach the dorsal surface ofTHE EXTENSOR PROPRIUS POLLICIS. 365 the metatarsal phalangal articulations, apply themselves to the inner edges of the corresponding tendons of the extensor hrevis, receive some expansions from the interossei and lumbricales, and are arranged in precisely the same manner as the extensor tendons of the fingers, forming a fibrous sheath on the dorsal surface of the first phalanx of the toes; and like these, havmg arrived at the articulations of the first with the second phalanges, each divides into three portions; one median attached to the posterior extremity of the second pha- lanx, and two lateral, which unite upon the dorsal surface of the second pha- lanx to be inserted into the posterior extremity of the third. Relatims. InternaUy this muscle is in relation with the tibiahs anticus, from which it is soon separated by the extensor proprius pollicis, and exter- naUy with the peroneus longus and brevis. It is covered by the fasciae of the leg and foot, and it covers the fibula, the interosseous ligament, the ankle joint, the extensor brevis digitorum, which separates it from the tarsus and metatarsus: lastly it covers the toes. Action. As in all reflected muscles, we must suppose the power to be exerted immediately after its reflexion, and in the direction of the reflected portion: in this way it will be seen, that it extends the third phalanges upon the second, and the second upon the first; and having produced this effect, it flexes the foot upon the leg. From its obliquity it also draws the toes out- wards, and turns the sole of the foot inwards. The Extensor Proprius Pollicis, The extensor proprius pollicis (rf, 128.) is an elongated, thin, flat muscle, placed in front of the leg, between the extensor longus digitorum, and the tibialis anticus. Attachments. It arises from the internal surface of the fibula, and slightly from the adjacent part of the interosseous ligament, within and behind the ex- tensor communis. This origin is situated at variable heights, but commonly not above the middle third of the leg. It is inserted into the posterior ex- tremity of the second phalanx of the great toe. The fleshy fibres arise di- rectly from the fibula and the interosseous ligament, and proceed at first vertically around, and then obliquely behind a tendon, which occupies the an- terior border of the muscle, and to which the fleshy fibres are aU attached in a sloping manner, like the barbs of a feather, as far down as below the proper sheath formed for it at the tarsus. From thence the tendon is re- flected at a right angle, proceeds obliquely and horizontally forwards and inwards upon the dorsum of the foot, passes along the dorsal surface of the first metatarsal bone and first phalanx of the great toe, to the latter of which it gives off a prolongation on each side, and is then inserted into the second phalanx. Rehtions. Internally, it is in relation with the tibialis anticus, from which it is separated behind by the anterior tibial nerve and vessels; and externally, with the extensor longus digitorum. Its anterior border, at first concealed between the preceding muscles, is soon situated immediately beneath the fascia, and during its contraction forms a projection, which it is important to know, because it serves as a guide in searching for the dorsal artery of the foot, which will always be found on the outer margin of the tendon: it may be called the muscle of the arteria dorsalis pedis. In the foot it crosses super- ficially to the extensor brevis digitorum. Action. It extends the second phalanx of the great toe upon the first, and that upon the metatarsus; when this is accomplished, it flexes the foot upon the leg. In consequence of its obliquity, it tends, like the preceding muscle, to turn the toes outwards, and slightly to elevate the inner border of the foot.366 MYOLOGY. External Region of tue Leg. la this region are found the peroueus longus and peroneus brevis muscles. The Peroneus Longus. Dissection. This is common to both muscles. Remove the skin on the outer side of the leg ; make a vertical incision through the fascia ; reflect the two flaps, in orderto arrive at thetendinous septa dividing the peronei from the muscles of both the anterior and posterior regions of the leg. To expose these muscles in the foot, remove the outer portion of its dorsal fascia, and divide obliquely inwards and forwards all the muscles of the plantar region, from the groove of the cuboid to the posterior extremity of the first metatarsal bone. The peroneus longus (,e,figs. 128. to ISO.) is a long thick muscle, prismatic and triangular at its upper part, and superficially situated on the outer side of the leg (peroneus primus, Spigelius). Attachments. It arises externally from the outer and anterior part of the head of the fibula; from a small portion of the contiguous part of the external tuberosity of the tibia; from the upper third of the external surface of the fibula ; and from the anterior and posterior borders of that bone, by means of very strong tendinous septa, interposed between it and the anterior and pos- terior muscles of the leg ; lastly, from the fascia of the leg superiorly. It is inserted into the posterior extremity of the first metatarsal bone, on the outer side of which a process exists for this purpose. From these very numerous origins, the fleshy fibres proceed vertically and form a bundle (e,fig. 130.), thick above, thin and flat below, and terminating in a tendon which is at first concealed in the substance of the muscle, but ap- pears in the form of a band on its outer side a little above the middle of the fibula, and becomes narrower and thicker as it proceeds. The tendon soon leaves the fleshy fibres, and accompanies the external sui-face ot the fibula as it turns backwards (peroneus posticus. Rial), then passes behind the external malleolus in a groove common to it and to the peroneus brevis, and is reflected forwards and downwards to the outer side of the os calcis, upon which it is held by a separate sheath. Having reached the outer side of the cuboid bone it is again reflected, enters a groove running obliquely inwards and forwards upon the lower surface of that bone {e,figs. 132, 133.), where it is retained by a very strong and compact sheath, and continues its oblique course without any deviation, along the lower surface of the tarsal bones as far as the pos- terior extremity of the first metatarsal bone. In this way the tendon of the peroneus longus undergoes a double reflection, first, behind the external mal- leolus, in which situation a thickening or knot is often seen, and secondly at the cuboid bone, opposite which a sesamoid bone almost always exists. There are also three fibrous sheaths, and three synovial membranes belonging to this tendon, one behind the external malleolus, one upon the outside of the OS calcis, and a third under the cuboid bone. Relations. In the leg, the peroneus longus is covered by the skin and the fascia of the leg: it covers the peroneus brevis. In front, a tendinous septimi intervenes between it and the extensor longus digitorum: behind, another in- termuscular septum exists between it and the soleus above, and the flexor proprius below. On the outside of the foot, its tendon corresponds to the skin externally, and to the os calcis internally. In the plantar region, it is covered below by" the entire thickness of the soft parts, and corresponds above to the inferior tarsal ligaments. Action. As we have already so frequently observed, a reflected muscle acts as if the power were applied at the point of reflection. In this way, by trans- ferring the power to the outer end of the groove on the cuboid bone, we shall find that the foot is abducted, or rather rotated outwards by this muscle; by367 THE GASTROCNEMIUS, next supposing the power to act from the other point of reflection, i. e. from behind the external malleolus, v/e may observe that the foot is extended upon the leg, and its outer border turned upwards. In this movement the lower end of the external articular surface of the astragalus tends to carry the ex- ternal malleolus outwards, and to increase the curvature of the fibula, which is sometimes fractured in consequence. It may be easily conceived that if the fibula be fractured, the contraction of this muscle will no longer be counter- acted, and accordingly will turn the sole of the foot outwards, and may luxate the astragalus inwards. This is the mechanism of luxation of the foot oc- curring after fracture of the fibula, the only species of lateral dislocation of this part which has ever been observed.* The Peroneus Brevis. The peroneus brevis of Albinus (peroneus secundus, Splgel; le petit peronier, Winslow, f. Jigs. 129, 130.), is a flat, penniform, and reflected muscle, smaller and shorter than the preceding, beneath which it lies. Attachments. It arises from the lower half, sometimes from the lower two thirds of the external surface of the fibula, which is more or less excavated for this purpose ; from the anterior and posterior borders of the same bone, and from the tendinous septa existing between this muscle and those of the anterior and posterior regions of the leg. It is inserted into the posterior extremity of the fifth metatarsal bone, and sometimes even by a tendinous expansion into the fourth metatarsal bone ; it often gives ofi' a prolongation to the extensor tendon of the little toe. The fieshy fibres proceed successively from their different origins to the in- ternal surface and edges of a tendon, situated upon the outer surface of the muscle; the bundle which they form gradually increases in size, and then diminishes, is at first penniform and afterwards semi-peuniform, and ac- companies the tendon as far as the fibrous sheath behind the external mal- leolus : after leaving the sheath, the tendon enters another proper to itself, upon the outer side of the os calcis, above that for the tendon of the peroneus longus, and passes somewhat obliquely downwards and forwards, to be inserted into the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. Relations. It is covered by the peroneus longus, and covers the fibula and the outer side of the os calcis. It is, therefore, only in comparison with the peroneus longus, that Riolanus and others have called this muscle the anterior peroneus. Action. The same as that of the peroneus longus, with the exception of that of its subtarsal portion. Thus, supposing the power to be applied at the external malleolus, we have extension of the fifth metatarsal bone upon the cuboid; extension and rotation inwards of the second row of the tarsus upon the first; rotation of the calcaneum upon the astragalus; extension, and a tendency to abduction of the entire foot, which is therefore considerably everted when the fibula is fractured. Posterior Region. There are two layers in this region, one superficial, formed by the gastro- cnemms and soleus (or triceps suralis) and the plantaris; the other deep, con- sisting of the popliteus, the tibialis posticus, the flexor longus digitorum, and the flexor longus pollicis. TJie Gastrocnemius and Soleus, or Triceps Suralis, and the Plantaris. Dissection.

Dupuytron, on fracture of the fibula.MYOLOGY. 368 semi-circular incision, embracing the back part of the thigh j divide and dissect the fascia of the leg. The gastrocnemii will then he exposed, and must be dissected very carefully at their origins. In order to study the struc- ture and attachments of these muscles properly, they must, be cut transversely in the middle, and the superior half turned upwards. In dividing the outer head of the gastrocnemius, be careful not to cut the plantaris, which seems to be merely a small fasciculus detached from that muscle. The soleus is exposed by simply removing the gastrocnemius ; but, in order to study its structure and attachments, it must be divided vertically from behind forwards at the side of a median tendinous raphe, and the fibres which conceal this median aponeurotic lamina of the muscle must be scraped away. From this division we have a fibular and a tibial portion of the soleus. The gastrocnemius (_g g') and the soleus (i i',fig. 129)together constitute avery powerful triceps muscle (musculus suree. Seem.'), which by itself forms the fleshy part of the leg, commonly called the calf. The great developement of these muscles is one of the most marked characteristics of the muscular ap- paratus of the human subject, and is connected with his destination for the erect position. The three portions of the triceps suralis are united together below in a common tendinous insertion, constituting the tendo Achillis (<, fig. 129.), but are divided above into two very distinct planes : one, anterior or deep, formed by the soleus; the other, posterior or superficial, consisting of the two heads of the gastrocnemius. We shall describe these in succession. Gastrocnemius. The gastrocnemius, from yaarrip, a belly, and (fv^/iTj the leg (gemellus, Albinus; primus pedem moventium, cum secundo, Vesalius), is the most superficial muscle on the back of the leg : it consists of two heads above (g g', fig. 129.), but forms a single fleshy belly, which is thick and flattened from before backwards. It arises from the condyle of the femur by two perfectly distinct but similar heads, viz. an outer or smaller, called the gemellus extemus (jr), and an inner or larger, named the gemellus internus (g'). They take their origin from the bone by two very strong and flat tendons, which are attached on the outer side and be- hind the condyle of the femur to two well-marked digital impressions, that for the outer head being situ- ated above a much deeper impression for the popliteus muscle, and that for the inner head immediately be- hind the tubercle into which the adductor magnus is inserted, so that the inner head is situated upon a plane a little posterior to that of the outer head. They also arise by tendinous fasciculi from the rough triangular surfaces surrounding the digital impression, and termi- nating at the inferior bifurcation of the linea aspera. Each tendon of origin (that for the inner being much larger than that for the outer head) expands into an apo- neurosis upon the posterior surface of that portion of the muscle to which it belongs. The aponeurotic ex- pansion of the inner head is, moreover, thicker and longer than the other, and embraces the mner border of that part of the muscle, like a tendinous semi-cone. The fleshy fibres arise from the anterior surface of these tendinous expansions, and are disposed in the foUowmg manner: those in the middle, which are few m number, are strengthened by fleshy fibres proceeding from theTHE SOLEUS. 369 rough projections of the bifurcation of the linea aspera, pass inwards and downwards, and are united together like the limbs of the letter V opening upwards, upon a median raphe, which consists either of a simple thickening of the terminating aponeurosis, or of a small tendinous septum : the other fibres, constituting almost the entire muscle, arise from the anterior surface of the tendons of origin, and from the aponeurosis in which they terminate, and pro- ceed vertically downwards to the back of another very dense aponeurotic ex- pansion, which covers the whole anterior surface of the muscle. This last aponeurosis commences above by two very distinct portions ; at first it is of equal breadth with the muscle, then becomes narrower and thickened, and finally closely united with the terminal tendon of the soleus. At the lower part of the calf the fleshy fibres terminate suddenly upon the posterior surface of this aponeurosis, forming a V opening downwards. Although the two portions of the gastrocnemius become intimately united shortly after their origin, they are not confounded together, and the internal portion forms on the inside of the tibia the greatest part of the fleshy mass called the calf of the leg. 1 Relations. The gastrocnemius is covered by the fascia of the leg, and it covers and adheres intimately to the capsular ligament, which envelops the back part of the condyles of the femur. It is also in relation with the popli- teus and the soleus. The tendon of the inner head corresponds to the posterior surface of the internal condyle; that of the outer head to the outer side of the external con- dyle. We often find at the upper part of the tendon of each head, but most commonly in the substance of that of the outer head, a sesamoid bone, that glides upon the back of the condyle, and belongs to the sort of fibrous capsule or hood, by which the back of each condyle is covered. (Vide Syndesmologt, Articulation of the Knee.) The Plantaris. This little muscle (le plantaire grele, W, fig. 129.), should be regarded as an accessory of the outer head of the gastrocnemius, or rather as a rudi- mentary muscle in the human subject. Its small fusiform fleshy belly, vary- ing much in size, is found beneath the outer head of the gastrocnemius.' It arises (I) from the fibrous capsule covering the external condyle, and sometimes from the lower part of the external bifurcation of the linea aspera. From these points, it passes obliquely downwards and inwards; and after a course of from two inches and a half to three inches, ends in a lono- flat and slender tendon, which is at first situated between the gastrocnemius and soleus and afterwards (/') hes parallel with the inner edge of the tendo AchUlis and is inserted into the os calcis, either at the side, or in front of that tendon. Sometimes, however, it is lost in the subcutaneous adipose tissue.

The tibial origins (i') take place from the oblique line on the posterior sur- face of the tibia below the popliteus, and from the contiguous portion of the aponeurotic expansion of that muscle; from an aponeurosis which arises from the middle third of the inner border of the tibia, and is prolonged upon the anterior surface, within the substance of the muscle; and lastly, by a few fleshy fibres from a tendinous arch extending between the head of the fibula and the oblique line on the posterior surface of the tibia. From these different origins, the fleshy fibres pass in different directions to the anterior surface and edge of an aponeurosis, which covers the posterior surface of the muscle, be- comes narrower and thickened as it proceeds downwards, unites with the terminal tendon of'the gastrocnemius about the middle third of the leg, and is soon blended with it to form the tendo Achillis. In order to study accurately the structure of the soleus, divide it longi- tudinally at the side of the raphe or tendinous septum, existing in the middle of the lower half of this muscle, and then by scraping off some of the fleshy fibres, it will be seen, that a dense fibrous septum given off by the terminal aponeurosis, separates the muscle into two equal halves, and forms with that aponeurosis two tendinous senai-cones, in the interior of which the fleshy fibres are received. It will now be understood why Douglas, who had de- signated the gastrocnemius the two external and superficial heads of the great extensor of the tarsus, should call the soleus the two internal and deep heads of the same muscle. There are, in fact, two principal aponeuroses of origin, and two hollow tendons of insertion; each aponeurosis of origin covers almost the entire anterior surface of the corresponding half of the muscle. Relations. It is covered by the gastrocnemius, which projects beyond it on both sides, but especially on the inner side, and from which it is separated by the plantaris. It is thickest immediately below the largest part or belly of the inner portion of the gastrocnemius, and consequently it prolongs the swelling of the calf downwards. It covers the muscles of the deep layer, viz. the flexor communis digitorum, the flexor proprius pollicis, and the tibiahs posti- cus • it also covers the posterior tibial and the fibular vessels and nerves. The tendo Achillis. The tendo AchilUs (Z, fiys.}29, 130.) results from the union of the tendons of the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus. It is termed ' =n the following manner: the terminal aponeurosis of the gastrocnemius, shortly after leaving the fleshy fibres, is intimately united to that of the soleus, which still continues to receive fleshy fibres upon its anterior surface and its edges, and gradually becoming narrower, is soon joined by the antero-posterior sep- tum of this muscle. All these tendinous fibres are coUected together to form the strongest and largest tendon in the body, known by the name of the tendo i/X which after a course of about an inch and a half or two inches glides ^ver th; smooth surface presented by the superior two thirds of the back of the OS calcis, with the intervention of a synovial bursa, and is expanded a l.ttle in order to be inserted into the rough surface on the lower part of the same ^°^c<ion of the qasb-omemius and soleus.

Hence it is not surprising, that occasionally an energetic contraction of these muscles may rupture the tendo Achillis, or fracture the os calcis. Frequent exercise ap- pears to be necessary for these muscles; for when they remain inactive, they become atrophied, and are speedily affected with fatty degeneration. The action of the soleus, which reaches only from the leg to the heel, is limited to extension of the foot; but the gastrocnemius, which is attached to the femur, after having extended the foot, can flex the leg upon the thigh ; but from its proximity to the fulcrum, this last action is very slight. When the foot is fixed, as for example in standing, the soleus acts upon the leg, and tends to prevent one from falling forwards, to which there is a constant tendency from the weight of the body ; the action of the gastrocnemius, on the contrary, is to flex the thigh, and in this respect it is altogether independent of the soleus. The plantaris can only be regarded as rudimentary in man ; in the lower animals it is a tensor of the plantar fascia; it has been, as it were, cut short in man, in consequence of his destination for the erect position. Sometimes, as we have already stated, it is lost upon the fatty tissue covering the os calcis. This is a The Popliteus. small triangular aiid very thin muscle fig. 130.), situated in the popliteal space. _ It arises from a deep fossa, resembling a groove run- ning from behind forwards, on the back of the external condyle of the femur, below the origin of the outer head of the gastrocnemius. It is inserted into the entire extent of the triangular surface on the upper part of the posterior aspect of the tibia. It arises by a very strong tendon, which bears no proportion to the diminutive size of the muscle. Thiu tendon, at first concealed by the external lateral liga- ment, contained as it were in the cavity of the joint, and completely enveloped by the synovial membrane) passes obliquely behind the articulation, and after ex- tondmg for about one inch, divides, like the tendon of the obturator internus, into four or five small diverging bundles, which soon surround the fleshy fibres on all sides. The latter then become attached in succession to the triangular surface of the tibia, the lowest being the longest and the most obUque. The superficial fibres are inserted into a tendinous expansion from the semi- membranosus, which covers the posterior surface of the po^teus muscle, and forms a very strong sheath for it. Relations. It is covered by the gastrocnemius and the plantaris, from which it is separated by the pop- liteal vessels, and the internal popliteal branch of the sciatic nerve. It covers the tibio-fibular articulations and the back of the tibia. Action. It flexes the leg upon the thigh, and at the same time rotates it inwards (oblique movens tibiani, bpujehus). In this last respect, it antagonises the biceps' -/ Fig. 130. T}ie Tibialis Posticus. Dissection.

The tibialis posticus (n, fig. 130.) is the most deeply seated of all the muscles on the back of the leg; it is very thick, and occupies the whole depth of the excavation between the tibia, fibula, and interosseous ligament. Attachments. It arises from the tibia, the fibula, and the interosseous liga- ment, and is inserted into the scaphoid bone. Its tibial and fibular origins form a bifurcation for the passage of the posterior tibial artery. Its tibial attach- ment takes place on the oblique line situated below the popliteus, soleus, and flexor longus digitorum. Its fibular origin is from the inner border of that bone, below the soleus, and from all that portion of its inner surface, which is behind the interosseous ligament. It also arises from the entire posterior surface of this ligament. Lastly, a few fibres take their origin from the deep surface of an aponeurosis, which separates the deep from the superficial layer of muscles, and from the tendinous septa interposed between this muscle itself and the flexor longus digitorum on the inside, and the flexor proprius pollicis on the outside. From these numerous origins the fleshy fibres proceed vertically downwards, around a tendon which may be distinguished near the upper extremity of the muscle under the form of a tendinous sheaf, which afterwards appears along its posterior border, and receives the fleshy fibres on its anterior surface, like the barbs of a feather upon the shaft. This tendon, however, is nothing more than the thickened posterior edge of an aponeurosis occupying the entire sub- stance of the muscle from before backwards, and receiving the fleshy fibres upon its two lateral surfaces as far down as opposite the internal malleolus. The thick tendon resulting from the union of these aponeurotic fibres then becomes free and enters a proper sheath on the outer side of that belonging to the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, in front of which it then passes behind the internal malleolus, where it is also inclosed in a separate sheath (71, fiy. 129.). On the inner side of the internal lateral ligament of the ankle and below the lower calcaneo-scaphoid ligament it enters another sheath, and is finally inserted (n, fig. 133.) into the tubercle of the scaphoid hone, a very thick sesamoid bone existing near its insertion. In some subjects this sesa- moid bone is found at the point of insertion; in others it is situated opposite the calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. Besides this the tendon of the tibiahs posticus gives oS a very strong expansion to the first cuneiform bone, and on the outside an oblique expansion to the second and third cuneiform bones, and even to the third or fourth metatarsal bones. a Belations. It is covered by the flexor longus digitorum, shghtly by the flexor proprius polUcis, and entirely by the soleus : it covers the interosseous liga- ment and the adjacent parts of the tibia and fibula. Action The tibialis posticus extends the foot upon the leg. As it is a re- flected muscle, aU the fibres must be considered as acting from the pomt ot reflection that is behind the inner ankle. It is evident, then that this muscle extends the foot, both by its action upon the astragalo-scaphoid articulation, and S bv that upon the ankle joint. It also tends to turn the sole of the foot ffward^s andrconsequently, it cooperates with the tibialis anticus in this re- inwaros , J:"^, peroneus longus and brevis.

This is a penniform, elongated, and reflected muscle (o, figs. 130.132.), situ- ated along the posterior surface of the tibia and in the sole of the foot; it is the most internal muscle of the deep layer, is flattened from before backwards, and terminates below in four tendons. Attachments. It arises from the tibia, and is inserted into the last phalanges of the last four toes. It arises from the oblique line of the tibia, below the po- pliteus and the soleus, and from the middle three fifths of the posterior surface of the same bone. Some fibres also proceed from the tendinous septum inter- vening between it and the tibialis posticus. From these different origins the fleshy fibres proceed obliquely backwards and downwards to the anterior sur- face and edges of a tendon, which commences near the upper end of the muscle, and gradually disengages itself from the fleshy fibres, being accompanied by them anteriorly as far as the internal malleolus. It passes behind this projection in the same sheath as the tendon of the tibialis posticus, from which it is se- parated by a fibrous septum; it soon leaves that tendon, passing to its outer or fibular side (o, fig. 129.), and is then reflected at an obtuse angle upon the internal malleolus. It now becomes horizontal, and is buried under the astra- galus and the small anterior tubercle of the os calcis, where it is contained in a proper sheath. Having thus reached the sole of the foot (o, figs. 131,132.) it pa.sses obliquely outwards and forwards, crosses under the tendon of the flexor longus poUicis at a very acute angle, receives from it a strong tendinous com- munication, and at the same time becoming expanded is joined by its accessory muscle, and finally divides into four tendons for the last four toes. The tendon for the second toe proceeds directly forwards. The tendons for the other toes in succession pass more and more obliquely. Having reached the metatarso- phalangal articulations these tendons are received, together with those of the flexor brevis digitorum, into the sheaths upon the first and second phalanges • and they have precisely the same relations to the tendons of the last mentioned muscle, as the flexor profundus is observed to have with regard to the flexor subhmis digitorum in the hand; and hence the name of perforans given by Spigebus to the long flexor of the toes.

From these numerous points of origin, the fleshy fibres pass obliquely downwards and backwards, around a tendon which occupies the en- tire length of the muscle, and may be seen at the lower part of the leg, through a thin layer of muscular fibres. These fibres terminate abruptly behind the ankle joint, at the oblique groove on the astragalus, in which the tendon is lodged; it then turns into a groove on the os calcis, forming a continuation of the preceding {fig. 133.), and situated below that for the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, and dips into the sole of the foot. It is retained in these two grooves, which run obliquely downwards, inwards, and forwards, by a very stronn- and continuous sheath {fig. 132.). In the sole of the foot, the tendon is deeply situated (p.^jf. 131.), passes forwards, and crosses {p,fig. 132.) at an acute angle above the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, to which it gives off a considerable fibrous prolongation. It is then received in a groove formed between the flexor brevis digitorum, and the oblique adductor of the great toe, passes below the anterior glenoid ligament of the metatarso-phalangal articu- lation of that toe, between the two sesamoid bones, and is received into the osteo-fibrous sheath of the first phalanx, to be inserted into the posterior extremity of the second. . Relations. It is covered by the soleus, being separated from it by a tascia, which increases in thickness as it passes downwards; it is also covered by the tendo AchiUis ; it covers the fibula, the tibialis posticus, the peroneal artery, and the lower part of the interosseous ligament. Externally, it is in relation with the peroneus longus and brevis ; internally, with the flexor longus digi- *°™™iow. It flexes the second phalanx of the great toe upon the first, and this upon the first metatarsal bone ; having produced these movements, it then extends the foot upon the leg. From the obliqmty of its fleshy belly at has a tendency to turn the great toe and the foot outwards. In this respect it anta- gonises ihe flexor longus digitorum and the tibiahs posticus The very strong fendinous expansion which unites it to the long flexor of the toes consohda es the two muscles; in fact, it is very uncommon to find either of them acting m- dependently.

The Extensor Brevis Digitorum. Dissection. Remove the dorsal fascia of the foot, and the tendons of the muscles of the anterior region of the leg. , ., , , The extensor brevis digitorum {q,fig. 128.) is a thin, flat, quadrilateral muscle, situated on the dorsum of the foot; it is divided into four portions anteriorly, and is an accessory of the extensor longus digitorum. It arises from the os calcis, and is inserted into the first four toes. It arises, by a roimded extremity, from a small excavation on the outside of the foot, formed by the os calcis and the astragalus {the astragalo-calcanean fossa), and from the os calcis in front of that excavation. Its origin from these parts is both fleshy and tendinous. The muscle then passes forwards and in- wards, and soon divides into four fleshy fasciculi, each representing a little penniform muscle, and terminating quickly in a small tendon, the size of which is proportioned to the strength of the fasciculus. The internal tendon is the largest, because it is intended for the great toe; it is situated below the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis, which it crosses at a very acute angle, and is inserted into the dorsal surface of the proximal end of the last phalanx. The second, third, and fourth tendons, intended for the second, third, and fourth toes, are subjacent to the corresponding tendons of the extensor longus digi- torum, which they cross at a very acute angle. Having reached the metatarso- phalangal articulations, the tendons of the short extensor are situated to the outside of those of the extensor longus, and are blended with them, so as to com- plete the fibrous sheath on the dorsal surface of the first phalanx, and to ter- minate in a similar manner. Relations. It is covered by the dorsal fascia of the foot, by the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and extensor proprius pollicis ; it covers the second row of the tarsal bones, the metatarsus, and a small portion of the in- terosseous muscles, and the phalanges. The arteria dorsalis pedis runs at first along the inner border of this muscle, which overlaps the artery, where the latter perforates the first interosseous space, in order to reach the sole of the foot. Action. It extends the fii'st four toes; it acts upon the first phalanx only of the great toe. Its obliquity enables it to correct the contrary oblique move- ment communicated to the toes by the contraction of the extensor longus digi- torum ; so that the opposite actions of these two muscles are mutually destroyed, and the foot is extended directly. Not uncommonly, the extensor brevis pre- sents a fifth fasciculus, which is lost upon some one of the metatarso-phalangal articulations. Internal Plantar Region. The muscles of the ball of the great toe may be divided, like those of the thumb, into two orders, viz. those which pass from the tarsus to the inner side of the first phalanx, and those which pass from the tarsus to the outer side of the same phalanx. Here, as with the muscles of the thumb, the tendon of the flexor longus divides the flexor brevis pollicis pedis of authors into two parts,—one internal, forming the flexor brevis of the great toe, properly so called; the other external, which is found to be connected with the oblique adductor of this toe. Muscles inserted into the inner Side of the First Phalanx of the Great Toe. Dissection, In order to expose the abductor brevis, it is sufficient to remove the internal plantar fascia; the flexor brevis will be found under, t. e. deeper than the tendon of the abductor brevis. B n 4376 MYOLOGY. The muscles inserted into the inner side of the first phalanx of the great toe, are the abductor brevis and the flexor brevis. They are distinct at their origins, but are often blended at their insertions ; so that Winslow united them together under the name of le thenar du pied. The Abductor Pollicis Pedis. This muscle (le court adducteur,* Cruveilhier, r, fig. 131.) is the most super- ficial in the internal plantar region ; it arises on the inside, from the internal posterior tuberosity Fig. 131. of the OS calcis; from the internal annular liga- ment imder which the posterior tibial vessels and nerves pass ; from the upper surface of the internal plantar fascia; and from the lower surface of a tendinous expansion, which occupies the entire extent of the deep or superior surface of the muscle. From these points, the fleshy fibres pro- ceed to the circumference of a tendon (r,figs. 132, 133.), which emerges from them inferiorly near the first cuneiform bone, but is often accompanied by them superiorly as far as its insertion into the internal sesamoid bone, opposite the first phalanx of the great toe. Belations. It is covered below by the uitemal plantar fascia, and is divided from the muscles of the middle plantar region by a tendinous septum which gives attachment to some of its fleshy fibres. It is superficial to the flexor brevis pol- licis, the flexor accessorius, the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum and that of the flexor longus poUicis, the tarsal insertions of the tibialis anticus and posticus, the plantar vessels and nerves, and the internal articulations of the tarsus. Action. It is, properly speaking, a flexor of the great toe. The Flexor Brevis Pollicis Pedis. Adopting a similar plan in the definition of this muscle as in that of the short flexor of the thumb, I shall describe as the short flexor of the great toe, that portion (s,fig. 133.) only of the flexor brevis of authors, which ex- tends from the second row of the tarsus to the internal sesamoid bone of the metatarso-phalangal articulation of the great toe, and shall refer to the oblique adductor that portion (t) which is attached to the external sesamoid bone. This change appears to be warranted by the rule already laid down for the distinction of muscles. Community of the fixed points of origin is not suffi- cient to establish the unity of two muscles, provided their moveable insertions are distinct. A cellular interval and the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis establish anteriorly the line of demarcation between the flexor brevis and the adductor obliquus pollicis. According to this view, the flexor brevis pollicis (s, figs. 131, 132, 133.) arises from the second row of the tarsus, particularly from the cuboid and the third cuneiform bones, by some tendinous fibres which are formed by a con- tinuation of the inferior ligaments of the tarsus, and are common to this muscle and the internal portion (0 of the oblique adductor of the great toe. The tendon of the tibialis posticus (n,fig. 133.), or rather the prolongation which this tendon gives off to the fourth metatarsal bone, also furnishes some points of origin. The fleshy fibres proceeding from these difi'erent attachments form * See note, next page.THE ADDUCTOR POLLICIS PEDIS. 377 a bundle that gradually increases in size, becomes separated from the oblique adductor, and terminates in a tendon which is inserted into the external sesa- moid bone and also into the glenoid ligament of the metatarso-phalangal ar- ticulation.

They are exposed by cutting across, and turning forwards the flexr f brevis digitorum, the tendons of the flex-or longus digitorum, and the fle-.or accessorius: particular care should be taken, when the dissection has pxtended as far as the heads of the metatarsal bones, to avoid cutting the small transverse adductor. The Adductor Pollicis Pedis. This (I'abducteur oblique, Crtiveilhier, tt',fig. 133.) is the largest of all the plantar muscles ; it is prismatic and triangular, and occupies the great hollow formed by the last four metatarsal bones, and is bounded by the first metatarsal bone on the inner side. It extends from the second row of the tarsus to the external sesamoid bone of the great toe. It arises by two very distinct portions, the smaller {t,figs. 131, 132, 133.), common to it and to the flexor brevis, pro- ceeds from the cuboid bone; the other (t') is much larger and arises from the sheath of the tendon of the peroneus longus (e), from the posterior ex- tremities of the third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal bones, and from the trans- verse ligaments by which they are united. From these different origins the fleshy fibres pass more or less obliquely inwards, and are inserted by a ten- dinous bundle into the external sesamoid bone of the metatarso-phalangal ar- ticulation of the great toe, and into the posterior edge of the glenoid ligament of the same joint.

Cruveilhier to the muscles of the great I toe, from their respective actions upon it, m reference to the axis of the body ; the muscle [attached to the inner side of that toe being called its adductor, and those to the outer side its ^abductors. In the translation, however, the nomenclature of Albinus has been adopted, in ■ "hich the terms adductor and abductor have reference to the axis of the li?nb ; first, because it i. followed by the majority of authors, and, secondly, because it is in accordance witli the pn'ciple observed by M. Cruveilhier himself, in describing not only all the muscles of the nanu. but some even of those of the foot, viz. the interossei, which are classed by him as ab- ductori, or adductors, according as they draw the several toes from or towards an imaginary axis pass.ng through the second toe. By this change much risk of perplexity will be avoided, and a unif(.-m principle of nomenclature preserved as regards all the muscles of the hand and foot. In the description of each muscle of the great toe, the synonymes of Cruveilhier are given lietwcen braclcets ; but in all instances, both here and hereafter, where these muscles have in- cidentally to be mentioned, the names adopted from Albinus will be strictly adhered to.

Action. It is a powerful adductor and flexor of the great toe. The Transversus Pollicis Pedis. This small transverse bundle (I'abducteur transverse, Cruveilhier, u. Jig. 133) forms an appendage of the preceding muscle, and is represented in the hand by the transverse fibres of the adductor pollicis; it extends from the fifth me- tatarsal bone to the external sesamoid bone of ^he metatarso-phalangal articu- lation of the great toe. This muscle, which is of variable size, arises externally from beneath the head of the fifth metatarsal bone, by a tendinous and fleshy tongue, which is directed transversely inwards, is strengthened by other fibres arising from the anterior transverse ligament of the metatarsus, and from the interosseous aponeurosis, and is inserted into the outer side of the first phalanx of the great toe, where it is often blended with the attachment of the oblique adductor. Relations. It is in relation below with the tendons of the long and short flexors of the toes and with the lumbricalis, and above with the interosseous muscles. It is lodged in the anterior part of the deep concavity of the me- tatarsus, and is provided with a proper sheath. Actions. It adducts the great toe, and draws the head of the metatarsal bones towards each other. External Plantar Region. The Abductor Digiti Minimi. Dissection. This is common to the abductor and the flexor brevis. The first is exposed by simply removing the external plantar fascia, and the second by removing or reflecting down the first. The abductor digiti minimi (v,fig. 131.) is of the same form, the same struc- ture and almost the same size as the abductor pollicis, and extends from the OS calcis to the first phalanx of the litttle toe. It arises by tendinous and fleshy fibres from the external posterior tuberosity of the os calcis, from the outer side of the internal posterior tuberosity, and from an aponeurosis occupying the upper surface of the muscle. The fleshy fibres having arisen in succession from these different points, proceed obliquely round a tendon, from which they emerge, opposite the posterior extremity of the fifth metatarsal bone. 1 he fleshy beUy of the muscle appears to end at this point, but it is continued by other fibres, arising from the upper surface of the external plantar fascia, and inserted either into the common tendon, or separately by the side of this tendon into the outer part of the first phalanx of the Uttle toe A small fleshy bundle is frequently detached from the body of the muscle, and im- planted into the posterior extremity of the fifth metatarsal bone, together with a prolongation of the external plantar fascia, which serves as a tendon for it. Action. It is an abductor and flexor of the little toe.379 THE FLEXOR BREVIS DIGITORUM. riiis is 77(6 Flexor Brevis Digiti Minimi. a small fleshy fasciculus {x, figs. 131, 132 133.), situated along the a small ncsny ^^^^^^^^ )^^^^^^ gfth metatarsal bone, and forming a continuation of the series of interosseous muscles, with which it was for a long time con- founded (interosseus, Spigelim): it extends from the second row of the tarsus, and from the f-Jth me- tatarsal bone, to the first phalanx of the little toe. It arises from the ligamentous layer covenng the plantar surface of the metatarsal row of the tarsal bones, and from the posterior extremity of the fifth metatarsal bone; it is inserted into the outer side of the first phalanx of the little toe, or, more cor- rectly, into the posterior edge of the glenoid liga- ment of the metatarso-phalangal articulation of that toe. Some of the fleshy fibres will he found at- 7 tached to the entire length of the external border of the fifth metatarsal bone; and these sometimes form a small and very distinct muscle, representing the opponens digiti minimi of the hand. Relaiims. It is covered below by the plantar fascia, which is here very thin, and also by the ten- don of the abductor digiti minimi; it is in relation above with the fifth metatarsal bone and the first plantar interosseous muscle. Action. The same as that of the preceding muscle with regard to flexion, but its action is less powerful and less extensive. Middle Plantar Region. The Flexor Brevis Digitorum. Dissection. Remove the plantar fascia, which is intimately united to this muscle posteriorly. The flexor brevis digitorum (y, fig. 131.) a short thick muscle, narrow behind, and divided into four tendons in front. It arises from the inside of the external tuberosity of the os calcis, from the upper surface of the middle plantar fascia, from a special tendinous expansion occupying the lower surface of the muscle, and appearing to be a dependence of the plantar fascia; and, lastly, from an aponeurotic septum, situated between it and the muscles of the external plantar region. It forms a fleshy belly, which is narrow and thick behind, passes directly forwards, increases in breadth, and soon divides into four, some- times only into three fasciculi, constituting as many small and perfectly dis- tinct penniform muscles, the long and delicate tendons of which emerge from the fleshy fibres before reaching the metatarso-phalangal articulations, be- come flattened, and are then situated below and in the same sheath with the tendons of the flexor longus. Opposite the first phalanx each tendon of the short flexor bifurcates, to allow the passage of the corresponding tendon of the flexor longus, is formed into a groove, becomes re-united above the latter tendon, and once more bifurcates, in order to be inserted along the borders of the second phalanx (hence it was named perforatus by Spigelius, and le perfore du pied by Winslow). The short flexor of the toes is therefore analogous to the superficial flexor of the fingers. Relations. It is covered below by the plantar fascia and the skin ; it is in relation above with the plantar vessels and nei-ves, with the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, and with the flexor accessorius and the lumbricales, fromMYOLOGY. 380 which it is separated by a tendinous lamina. On its outer and inner side it IS completely isolated from all the adjacent muscles by prolongations of the plantar fascia. Action. It flexes the second phalanges of the last four toes upon the first phalanges, and these upon the corresponding metatarsal bones. The Flexor Accessarius. This is a flat quadrilateral muscle, foi;piing a considerable fleshy mass (massa carnea, Jacobi Sylvii, z, fig. 132.) ; it arises by a bifurcated extremity from the lower part of the groove of the os calcis, and a small part of the cal- caneo-scaphoid ligament by fleshy fibres, and by means of a tendon from the lower sujface of the same bone, this tendon sometimes extending as far as the external posterior tuberosity of the os calcis. From these points the fleshy fibres pass directly forwards, and terminate in the following manner: the lower fibres become inserted into the outer margin, and a small portion of the inferior surface of the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum; whilst the upper are inserted into several small fibrous bundles, which unite together, receive a considerable expansion from the tendon of the flexor longus poUicis, and are ultimately blended with, and increase the size of the divided tendon of the flexor longus digitorum. Relations. This muscle is in relation below with the flexor longus digitorum and the plantar vessels and nerves, and above with the os calcis and the inferior calcaneo-cuboid ligaments. Action. It is a muscle of re-inforcement, and assists in flexing the toes : from its obliquity it rectifies the oblique action of the flexor longus digitorum in the opposite direction. The Lumbricales. The lumbricales (I I, figs. 131,132.), which form a second class of accessory muscles belonging to the flexor longus digitorum, exactly resemble the lum- bricales of the fingers ; they consist of four small fieshy tongues, decreasing in size from within outwards, the two outer of which are not unfrequently atro- phied : they extend from the angles formed by the division of the tendons of the flexor longus to the inner or tibial borders of the first phalanges of the last four toes, and to the corresponding margins of the extensor tendons. They are distinguished by the numerical names oi first, second, third, and fourth. The first is situated parallel with the flexor tendon of the second toe. Relations. They are covered below by the flexor brevis digitorum; they emerge from beneath the plantar fascia, in the interval between the sheaths furnished by it to the flexor tendons, gain the inner side of the corresponding metatarso-phalangal articulation, and terminate upon the first phalanx and inner margin of the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum. They have the same action as the lumbricales of the hand. Interosseous Region. The Jnterossei. The interrosseous muscles of the foot correspond exactly with those of the hand, and require the same consideration. . ^. ^ They arise from the lateral surfaces of the interrosseous spaces m which they are placed • and are inserted into the sides of the first phalanges and the corresponding margins of the tendons of the extensor muscles. They are seven in number, viz. four dorsal (three of which are seen at d rf d,fig. 133.), and three plantar ifpp); to latter, however, the oblique adductor of the great toe may be added, for it is nothing more than a very large plantar inter- osseous muscle.PHYSIOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT OP THE MUSCLES. 381 As in the hand, the dorsal interrossei are abductors, their origins heing situated externally to the axis of the foot; the plantar interrossei again are adductors: hut the axis of the foot must be supposed to extend through the second, and not through the middle toe. As we observed in the hand, the dorsal interossei project into the plantar region, by the side of the plantar muscles; and so narrow are the interrosseous spaces in the foot, that these dorsal muscles are much more completely situ- ated in the plantar, than those of the hand in the palmar region. The plantar interossei corresponding to the fourth and fifth toes, arise not only from the lower two thirds of the internal or tibial side of the corresponding metatarsal bone, but also from the lower surface of the posterior extremity of the same bone. It follows, therefore, that the interosseous muscles, viewed from below, appear one continuous muscle, in which it would be difficult to separate the muscles of each space, if the interosseous plantar fascia did not give off prolongations between them ; elsewhere, a cellular line defines the limit between each plantar and dorsal muscle. Again, as in the hand, the dorsal interossei arise from two corresponding metatarsal bones at once, but more especially from the lateral surface of that metatarsal bone, which is directed from the axis of the foot: as in the hand, also, their posterior ex- tremities are perforated by the posterior perforating arteries, the first being perforated by the arteria dorsalis pedis. The plantar interossei arise from only one of the metatarsal bones, and from the lateral surface that is directed towards the imaginary axis of the foot; moreover, they do not arise from the entire thickness of the bone, but only from its inferior two thirds, since the upper third is covered by the dorsal muscle. The following are the general relations of the interossei: they are separated above, from the tendons of the extensors, by a layer of fibrous tissue, and by the dorsal interosseous fascia; and below from the proper muscles of the foot, by the deep plantar interosseous fascia, which is much stronger than the corresponding structure in the hand, and gives off septa between the different pairs of interosseous muscles. PHYSIOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE MUSCLES. However important it may be to become acquainted with the order of super- imposition, or the topographical arrangement of the muscles, it is no less ne- cessary to study the retrospective uses, in other words, the physiological arrangement of these organs.* In order to obtain as much as possible the advantages of each of these two methods, having already described each muscle in its topographical order, I shall now give a table of the muscles, ar- ranged according to their physiological relations. It is important to observe that the terms, muscles of the arm, of the thigh, Sfc. have not the same accept- loLa"arrTM Jp^'ln^'*'Tv!^ '"'^L"?^^ '° P"'"''''"" topographical to the physio- no^ Dcrmit T?f,P ™n Ji^^ only objection which can be urged against the'latter is, that it does oKT few reXZ^^^^^^^ be dissected upon the same subject; but this objection applies miiht surelv h? sTrifi^,?

Thus, by the term muscles of the arm, in the topographical order, we mean the muscles which occupy the region of the arm, as the deltoid, biceps, &c.; but in the physiological arrangement, the same term is applied to the muscles which move the arm, viz. the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, &c. Muscles of the Vertebro-cranial Column. These are divided into the extensors, the flexors, and the lateral muscles or lateral flexors, which incline the vertebral column to one side or the other. There are no rotators ; for rotation is performed by the extensor muscles. Extensors. These occupy the posterior region of the vertebral column. They consist on each side of, 1. the posterior spinal, or long muscles of the back, divided into the sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, and transverso-spinalis; 2. of the transversalis colli and the trachelo-mastoideus, which may be re- garded as accessory fasciculi to the longissimus dorsi; 3, of the splenius, or representative of the longissimus dorsi of the neck and head; 4. of the com- plexus, or transverso-spinalis of the head; 5. of the inter-spinales, in which the two recti postici of the head may be included; 6. of the obliquus major, or spino-transversalis of the atlas ; 7. of the obliquus minor, or transverso-spinalis of the head. Flexors. These are situated on the anterior region of the vertebro-cranial column. The most important of these muscles are carried forwards, and at- tached to the sternum, and to those long transverse processes called the ribs. They are on each side, 1. the rectus abdominis; 2. the sterno-cleido-mas- toideus. The other muscles that cooperate in flexion occupy the deep ante- rior cervical region, viz. 1. the rectus capitis anticus major; 2. the rectus capitis anticus minor ; 3. the longus colli. Lateral muscles. These are, 1. the inter-transversales of the neck and loins, among which I include the rectus capitis lateralis ; 2. the scaleni anticus et posticus ; 3. the quadratus lumborum. Muscles of the Ribs, or of the Thoracico-abdominal Parietes. These are I the inter-costales, externi and interni, which are both elevators and depressors ; 2. the small accessory muscles, viz. the infra-costales of Ver- heven and the supra-costales, or levatores costarum, the latter being always elevators; 3. the serrati postici superiores, which are elevators; 4. the serrati Dostici inferiores, depressors; 5. the triangularis sterni, or small anterior serratus also a depressor; 6. the diaphragm, a muscular septum, the contraction of which increases the vertical diameter of the thorax, and draws the ribs inwards. The muscles of the abdominal parietes are so intimately connected m action with those of the thorax, that the description of the former naturally follows that of the latter. The abdominal muscles, then, may be regarded as muscles of expiration, and are aU depressors of the ribs. There are, 1. the obliquus extemus which is nothing more than a large external intercostal muscle, ex- tSS between the ribs Ld the pelvis ; 2. the obliquus mternus, which may fe Srded as a large internal intercostal muscle, of which the cremaster is •i drpSnce; 3. the transversalis, which we may consideT as forming with the diaphragm a single muscle, interrupted by its costal attachments.

These are divided into elevators and depressors. AUthe e/emtora belong to the supra-hyoid region, and are, l.the stylo-hyoidei; 2. the mylo-hyoidei; 3. the genio-hyoidei. _ The depressors consist of the muscles of the infra-hyoid region; viz. 1. The sterno-hyoidei; 2. the stemo-thyroidei; 3. the thyro-hyoidei; 4. the omo- hyoidei. Muscles which move the Pelvis. There are no muscles proper to the pelvis. The ischio-coccygeus is the only intrinsic muscle. The extrinsic muscles attached to the pelvis do not be- long to its cavity, but merely take their fixed points from its parietes. It is only under particular circumstances that the pelvis changes its usual office and becomes the moveable point; for example, in the horizontal position, in the action of cUmbing, and in the reversed attitude of a tumbler, the pelvis is moved upon the vertebral column on the one hand, and upon the femur on the other. Muscles which move the Shoulder. The muscles of each shoulder are divided into elevators and depressors ; both of which are also rotators. The elevators are, 1. the trapezius; 2. the rhom- boideus ; 3. the levator anguli scapulae. The depressors are, 1. the pectoralis minor; 2. the subclavius; 3. the serratus magnus. The elevators and de- pressors of the entire shoulder must be carefully distinguished from those which raise or depress its apex. Muscles which move the Thigh upon the Pelvis. These muscles are divided into extensors, flexors, adductors, abductors, and rotators. The extensors and abductors are the same. viz. the three glutaei. The conjoined psoas magnus, iliacus, and psoas parvus constitute the only Jlexor. Adduction is performed by four muscles, viz. ihe pectineus and the three adductors. Rotation outwards is performed by six muscles, viz. the pyriformis, the two gemelli, the obturator internus, the quadratus femoris, and" the obturator ex- tomus. Rotation invmrds is performed by the tensor vaginse femoris, and especially by the anterior fibres of the glutmi, medius et minimus. Muscles which move the Arm upon the Shoulder. These muscles are divided into abductors, which are at the same time flexors, and into adductors and rotators. There are no proper muscles for the move- ment forwards or flexion, nor for the movement backwards or extension, both of which motions are effected by the adductors and abductors. The abductors are, 1. the deltoideus ; 2. the coraco-brachialis ; 3. the sunro- spmatus. ^MYOLOGY. 384 The adductors are, 1. the pectoralis major; 2. the latissimus dorsi; 3. the teres major. The rotators are, 1. the external, -viz. the infra-spinatus, and the teres minor; 2. the internal, viz. the sub-scapularis. Muscles which move the Leg upon the Thigh. These are divided into flexors and extensors. The flexors are, 1. the biceps femoris ; 2. the semi-tendinosus ; 3. the semi-membranosus; 4. the popliteus ; 5. the sartorius ; 6. the gracilis. ExtensioTt is performed by one muscle only, viz. the triceps femoralis, the long head of which is formed by the rectus femoris, and the other two heads by the triceps cruris of authors, viz. the vastus externus and vastus internus, including the crureus. I should remark that aU these muscles which arise from the pelvis perform the double function of moving the leg upon the thigh, and the thigh upon the pelvis. 3Iuscles which move the Fore-arm upon the Arm. These are divided into flexors and extensors. The flexors are the biceps and the brachialis anticus. The extensors are, 1. the triceps (of which the Icmg head resembles the rectus femoris); 2. the anconeus. Muscles which move the Radius upon the Ulna. These are rotators inwards, or pronators, viz. 1. the pronator teres, 2. the pronator quadratus ; and rotators outwards, or supinators, viz. 1. the supinator longus, 2. the supinator brevis. The pronators occupy the anterior region, the supinators the posterior region of the fore-arm. Muscles which move the Hand upon the Fore-arm. These arc divided into flexors and extensors. The flexors are, 1. the flexor carpi radialis; 2. the palmaris longus ; 3. the flexor carpi ulnaris. The ex- tensors are, 1. the extensores carpi radiales, longior et brevier; 2. the extensor carpi ulnaris. Adduction and abduction are also performed by these muscles. Muscles which move the Fingers. These are divided into extensors, flexors, adductors, and abductors. The extensors are, 1. the extensor communis digitorum; 2. the extensor digiti mi- nimi ; 3. the abductor longus pollicis; 4. and 5. the extensor brevis and extensor longus pollicis ; 6. the extensor proprius indicis. Tte flexors are, 1. the flexor sublimis digitorum; 2. the flexor profundus digitorum, and its accessories the lumbricales ; 3. the flexor longus pollicis. The extensors and the flexors of the fingers are all situated m the fore-arm; the adductors and abductors belong to the hand: they consist of the interossei, which are seven in number, four dorsal, constituting the abductors, and three palmar, which are adductors. , , , o m. Other muscles are also superadded to the thumb and the httle fanger. Ihe muscles superadded to the thumb are, 1. those which constitute the thenar eminence (baU of the thumb), viz. the abductor brevis, the opponens, and the flexor brevis; 2. the adductor poUicis, which is nothing more than a palmar interosseous Muscle. The muscles superadded to the little finger constitute the hypothenar eminence (ball of the little finger), and form, as it^^ere, si repetition of those of the thenar eminence, viz. the abductor brevis, the flexor brevb, and opponens. But although three only are thus described, it is becausePHYSIOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE MUSCLES. 385 the palmar interosseous muscle of the little finger, which represents the adductor pollicis, presents no peculiarities, and is therefore classed with the other palmar interossei. Muscles which move the Foot upon the Leg. These are divided into flexors and extensors: the same muscles also pro- duce, at the articulation of the two rows of the tarsal bones, movements of rotation, which correspond to adduction and abduction. The extensors are, 1. the gastrocnemius and soleus, or the triceps suralis, with which we describe a small rudimentary muscle, the plantaris ; 2. the tibialis posticus; 3. the peroneus longus et brevis. . There is only one flexor, viz. the tibialis anticus. The peroneus tertius, when it exists, is merely a dependence of the extensor longus digitorum. There are no muscles in the leg analogous to the pronators and supinators of the forearm. Muscles which move the Toes. These are divided into extensors and flexors. The extensors are, 1. the conjoined extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius ; 2. the extensor proprius pollicis ; 3. the extensor brevis digitorum. The flexors are, 1. the flexor longus digitorum and its accessories, the lum- bricales; 2. the flexor brevis digitorum ; the flexor longus poUicis. Contrary to what we have seen with regard to the fingers, many of the flexors and extensors of the toes form part of the intrinsic muscles of the foot. As in the hand, the adductors and abductors of the toes occupy the thenar' hypothenar, and interosseous regions. ' The interosseous muscles are adductors and abductors of the toes; they are seven in number, four dorsal, being the abductors, and three plantar, acting as adductors. The superadded muscles of the great toe are, 1. the muscles of the thenar eminence, viz. the abductor brevis and the flexor brevis; 2. the adductor obUquus, and the adductor transversus. The muscles superadded to the Uttle toe are the muscles of the hypothenar eminence, viz. the abductor and the flexor brevis. Cutaneous Muscles.

General observations on the aponeuroses. — Structure,—Uses. The aponeuroses are fibrous membranes, arranged in the form of inexten- sible textures, which constitute sheaths for the muscles, and, at the same time, afford them broad surfaces for attachment. The aponeuroses are generally known, at the present day, by the name of fascia (fascia, a band), an expression which was at first applied exclusively to the strong broad aponeurotic band, forming the termination of the tensor vaginae femoris and part of the fascia lata of the thigh. The aponeuroses constitute important adjuncts to the system of locomotion They were for a long time neglected, or rather studied independently of each other, and then only partially, until Bichat gave a general view of them, in his division of the fibrous system, including the membranous forms of that tissue of which the aponeuroses form the greatest part. As the aponeuroses have now become the object of numerous researches, and even the subject of some special treatises *, I have considered that it would be useful to offer a description of all the aponeuroses of the human body under the head of Aponeurology. This grouping together of analogous parts will have the double advantage of simplifying the description of the particular aponeuroses by making them elucidate each other, and of bringing into pro- minent notice a system of organs, the study of which is generally neglected in anatomical lectures. General observations. The aponeuroses are divided by Bichat mto two dis- tinct classes, one serving for the insertion of muscles, viz. the aponeuroses of insertion; the other for investing or containing the muscles, called the investing or confining aponeuroses. Many aponeuroses serve both these purposes at the same time ; but, in general, one or the other function predominates in each. The aponeuroses of insertion f are subdivided into those formed by the ex- panded continuations of tendons, and those which do not origmate in tendons. The aponeuroses of the gastrocnemius and soleus belong to the first class; those of the broad muscles of the abdomen are examples of the second : in the latter case the aponeuroses serve both for the insertion and investment of the muscles. Sometimes the aponeurosis occupies the middle of a muscle; as, for example, the cordiform tendon of the diaphragm, and the aponeurosis of the occipito- frontalis The use of the aponeuroses of insertion evidently has reference to the great number of muscular fibres, aU of which could not have been attached to the limited superficies of the skeleton. r i. The investing aponeuroses occasionally form a sheath for the entire limb, sometimes for only a single muscle, and at others for several muscles. Ihe firot set are called general, the other two partial aponeuroses. The aponeuroses are found not only in the extremities where they perform such important offices, but also in the trunk. As a general ru e, wherever there exists a muscle fulfiUing any special purpose, and susceptible of displacement Sff itT contraction, we find an aponeurosis, or rather an aponeurotic sheath ; tlicSess of this sheath is proportioned to the length and strength of ti,o miKiMe and especially to its tendency to displacement. E^ch ap^nrurosTs presents for our consideration an eternal a^i ^-'"'7" suf£ a^superior border or circunferen^e, sometimes termed its origin, and an i^erior border or circumference, sometimes caUed its terminution. 1.

The skin is therefore moveable upon these aponeuroses, excepting in some situations, as in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, where it is intimately united to the fascia by prolongations from the inner surface of the cutis. What, indeed, would be the consequences with regard to the sense of touch, or in the attitude of standing, if the skm over those regions were as moveable as it is upon the thigh ? The same ad- hesion is also observed between the hairy scalp and the subjacent aponeurosis. The mobility of the skin upon the aponeuroses depends upon the following contrivance. From the inner surface of the skin are given off a great number of prolongations, which, having intercepted the areolffi containing the adipose tissue, unite together and expand into a membrane, which glides over the apo- neuroses and the superficial vessels and nerves: the subcutaneous membrane thus formed bears the name of the fascia superficialis: it is only distinctly seen in regions that are traversed by superficial vessels and nerves, as in the lower part of the abdomen, and on the extremities. 2. The deep surface of a general investing aponeurosis presents fibrous pro- longations passing between the different layers of muscles, and even between the muscles of which these layers are composed. Moreover, this surface and its several prolongations sometimes afford attachments to the superficial muscles, and sometimes it glides over the muscles and their tendons by means of a very loose filamentous cellular tissue—an arrangement that prevails throughout the greater part of the extent of this surface. Lastly, amidst aU these sheaths for the muscles, there exists a proper sheath for the principal vessels of the extremities. These aponeui'otic sheaths are not so exactly moulded upon the muscles as not to admit of the accumulation of a certain quantity of fat in their interior; nevertheless, their capacity is so far proportioned to the size of the muscles, that the latter, during their contraction, experience a degree of pressure from them which is highly favourable to their action, at the same time that it prevents aU displacement. In emaciated individuals these sheaths are no longer filled by their respec- tive muscles; and, without doubt, the want of a due compression upon the muscles has some influence in producing the weakness experienced by con- valescents, or by those wasted by some chronic disease. 3. The borders or circumferences of aponeuroses, incorrectly named their origin and termination, are either continuous with the aponeuroses of the ad- jacent regions, or are attached to the processes on the articular extremities of the bones, or result, in part, from the expansion of tendons. The aponeuroses are perforated by vessels and nerves, which, in such cases, are guided and protected by arches, rings, or canals of fibrous tissue : of this nature are the sheaths of the femoral artery and vein, and of the brachial artery and veins, the femoral arch, the canal and arch of the adductor muscles of the thigh, the arch of the obturator foramen, and the aortic arch of the dia- phragm ; these canals and arches tend to prevent any injury to the vessels and nerves by which they are traversed during the contraction of the muscles. We must not suppose, however, that the vessels are exempt from all pressure; for experience has proved that arteries are particularly liable to become affected with aneurism in the neighbourhood of such arches; as, for example, the po- pliteal and femoral arteries and the aorta. The muscular fibres, in fact, are not attached to these arches in such a manner as to dilate them in all direc- tions during their contraction, but rather in such a way as to elongate them in one direction and contract them in another. All the aponeuroses, whether of insertion or of investment, have their ten- sor muscle. With regard to the aponeuroses of insertion, this requires no proof; for the action of the muscle or muscles to which they afford attach- ment must necessarily render them tense. It is no less true, however, of the mvestmg aponeuroses, some of which have even a separate muscle for this purpose. Thus the occipital and frontal muscles are tensors of the occipito-APONEUROLOGY. * Sco note, p. ;i8"J. frontal aponeurosis. The fascia lata is rendered tense by the tensor vagina; lemons, the palmar fascia by the palmaris longus, &c. The aponeuroses of both kinds are inextensible, resisting, and insensible membranes, their thickness and strength being exactly proportioned to the re- sisting power and strength of the muscles which are invested by them, or to which they afford the means of insertion. Thus, the fascia of the thigh is very much stronger than that of the arm: the thickness of the aponeu- roses increases from the upper to the lower part of the limbs; and again the powerful vastus externus is provided with a much stronger sheath than the muscles of the posterior, or of the internal region of the thigh. We may then consider it as a general law without exception, that the aponeurotic system invariably presents a corresponding degree of developement to that of the muscular system. We should therefore study the aponeuroses, as well as the muscles, upon robust subjects; their pearly aspect is destroyed in individuals wasted by chronic diseases. The aponeurotic and muscular systems are both most fully developed in camivora; in which class of animals the pearly ap- pearance is peculiarly well marked, and the cellular tissue is often replaced by a fibrous texture, a transformation which proves the analogy of the cellu- lar and fibrous tissues in organisation, vitality, and function.* The thinner fascies are composed of a single layer of parallel fibres, which have between them intervals of different sizes: stronger aponeuroses are com- posed of several planes, the fibres of which intersect each other at various angles. The vessels and nerves of the aponeuroses are little known ; but I believe that I have traced nerves into them. I have certainly done so with regard to the dura mater.* I shall include among the aponeuroses the fibrous sheaths of tendons*, which are sometimes presented imder the form of imperfect rings, or canals of differ- ent lengths, which retain the tendons in contact with the bones. They serve to confine the tendons, to keep them applied against the bones, and to favour their reflection. The periosteum * must also be annexed to the aponeurotic system; it is a true aponeurosis, covering every part of the bones, and constituting a fibrous sheath for them. We may consider the periosteum as the central point of the aponeurotic system, proceeding from which, we find either tendons expand- ing upon the surface or in the substance of muscles, and constituting the apo- neuroses of insertion ; or else those fibrous cones or pyramids, from the interior of which the fleshy fibres take their origin. From the periosteum, or rather from the ridges or clefts by which the surfaces of bones are marked, both the partial and general investing aponeuroses arise. In this way the muscles of the extremities are situated between two fibrous layers; the deep layer consisting of the periosteum, the superficial layer of the general investing fascia: numerous septa pass from one to the other, and divide the limb into a number of compartments, intended to isolate, confine, and protect the different muscles. Use of the aponeuroses. Forming as they do an important division of the fibrous textures, they partake of the physical, chemical, anatomical, physiolo- gical, and pathological properties of that tissue. 1. From their gi-eat strength they are enabled to resist the powerful traction and distension exercised upon them by the muscular fibres. Their division or destruction is accompanied by displacement of the parts which they are in- tended to bind down. Between the different layers of the regions of the body, they establish very precise limits, a knowledge of which is of the greatest im- portance, in enabling us accm-ately to account for many morbid phenomena, and in guiding us in the performance of surgical operations. 2. They are inextensible; hence the resistance which they oppose to the developement of subjacent parts, and the tension produced by inflammation ofGENERAL REMARKS ON THE APONEUROSES. 389 c c 3 organs situated beneath them. They yield to gradual distension, but then be- come thinner and weaker, and can only imperfectly fulfil their proper offices. 3. They are totally inelastic, and therefore when distended beyond a certain point never return to their original dimensions. Of this we have an example in the condition of the abdominal parietes after utero-gestation, or ascites. 4. The low degree of vitality they possess, explains why they are so slightly involved in inflammation or other morbid conditions of the adjacent structures, and also the fact of their establishing limits beyond which these diseases seldom pass. They are insensible to all ordinary stimuli, but become painful when they are violently overstretched. The plantar fascia, under such circumstances, becomes extremely sensitive. Having made these general remarks, we shall now describe, in succession, the principal aponeuroses of the human body.* * Note on Aponenrology. [The analogy existing between the cellular and aponeurotic invest- ments of various organs, renders it advantageous to consider in this place the general anatomy of the CL'lhtlar ixndjibrurai tissues. The ultimate elements of both these kinds of tissue are precisely similar, though somewhat diS'erently arranged in each ; they consist of delicate transparent lilaments, varying in diameter from jjjijijth to ugj;];"' of ^° imh, and having a peculiar sinuous or undulating direction ; they are insoluble in cold water, but by long continued boiling are almost entirely converted into gelatine. In cellular tissue these undulating filaments are arranged side by side, either into larger com- pound and flexuous fasciculi, or into thin transparent laminae, which cross and intersect one another in all directions, so as to leave interstitial cavities or areolae, freely communicating with each other, and moistened by an albuminous fluid. The tissue thus formed, more properly called areolar, or filamentous, is of a greyish aspect, and highly elastic ; the latter property depending not on any innate elasticity in the ultimate filaments, but on the sinuous disposition of those filaments, and of the fasciculi into which they are collected. But few vessels, and still fewer nerves, are believed to terminate in this tissue. It is continuous over the whole body ; hence the great extent to which it may be affected with diffuse inflammation: it also invests' and isolates parts, forms the matrix of nearly all organs, and the basis of many membranes ; and is called, according to its position, investing, intermediate, penetrating, parenchymatous, or submembranous. The characters above described are most strongly marked in the loose cellular tissue, examples of which are met with in the axilla, under the subscapular muscle, between the free surfaces of muscles and their sheaths, behind the kidneys, &c. In other situ- ations it is more condensed, as in the subserous, submucous, and subcutaneous cellular tissues • in the latter of these, or the superficial fascia, and also in the cutis itself, it approaches to the fibrous tissue both in density and in the mode of arrangement of its elementary filaments, and IS therefore termed Jibro-cellutar tissue. From this variety the transition is natural to the fibrous tissues, properly so called. }n fibrous tissue the undulating primitive filaments are also arranged side by side into fas- ciculi, which differ from those of cellular tissue in being much larger, more dense and more opaque, and in being straight instead of flexuous. They are white, shining, strong, and almost inelastic, qualities depending on the compact parallel disposition of the component filaments and the slight amount ot elasticity in particular on the absence of sinuosity in the compound tasciculi. According to the manner in which these fasciculi or fibres (as they are termed) are arranged and combined, we have either the membranous or the fascicular form of fibrous tissues In the mcmhrimous form there are some which closely resemble the fibro-cellular membranes already alluded to, and consist of the shining fibres crossing each other in all directions (with- out anastomosis), and intermixed with more or less condensed cellular tissue : for example the thinner investing aponeuroses, the capsular ligaments, the pericardimn, tunica albuginea, peri- ?nH n™,;- '"""'"s, again, the fibres are more parallel, though still intersected, and commned with cellular tissue, as in the fascia lata of the thigh, and in other strong invest- ng aponeuroses In the aponeuroses of insertion of the broad muscles, and in the expanded terminations of tendons there is scarcely any cellular tissue, whilst the parallel arrangement is ^ Vri"""'l'-'^' I'ltter attains its utmost perfection in the round ligaments, itself ""^^ "'"'^'^ constitute thejascicular form of fibrous tissue, and the type of the tissue Pr-m'?nf^'®'''1''^fK™1^'''" "^"^ few nerves and vessels.

Superficial fascia Aponeuroses of the cranium—of the face—of the neck—of the thorax—of the abdomen—of the pelvis—of the thigh, leg, and foot—of the shoulder, arm, forearm, and hand. The Supeeficlax Aponeurosis, or Superficial Fascia. From every point of the deep surface of the skin, fibrous cellular lamellae arise, which intersect each other in various directions, so as to form meshes or areolse, containing adipose tissue in ordinary circumstances, and a serous fluid in oedema.* The cutaneous muscle {panniculus carnosus) of the lower animals, is developed in these laminae ; and amongst them are situated the subcutaneous vessels and nerves, and the lymphatic glands. The name of fascia superficialis has been of late applied to this assemblage of lameUse. It was pointed out in a particular manner by Glisson, who described it under the name of the general investment of the muscles, proceeding from the spine, and covering the whole body; Camper, Cowper, Scarpa, Hesselbach, Law- rence, J. Cloquet, &c. have described it upon the abdomen, in its relation with hernise ; Godman has spoken of its existence over the entire surface of the body; M. Paillard, in his inaugural dissertation, traced it with still greater exactness ; MM. Velpeau and Blandin, in their Traites d'Anatomie Chirur- gicale, consider it as existing in almost all regions of the body. But if the word aponeurosis be employed in its ordinary acceptation, it will be found that a fascia superficialis, consisting of a fibrous texture capable of anatomical demonstration, exists only in two kinds of situations, viz. in those where the skin is extremely moveable, and in those where there is a layer of subcutaneous vessels and nei*ves: in both these cases the fibrous prolongations from the skin are expanded into a thin lamina, constituting a superficial cover- ing for these vessels and nerves, and separated from the fibrous investment of the muscles by a layer of cellular and adipose tissue of variable thickness. In all other parts, the fibro-cellular prolongations of the skin become continuous either with the investing aponeuroses, or with the proper fibro-cellular sheaths of the muscles, or are lost in the subcutaneous cellular tisue. So true is this, that this thin areolar layer, which can with difBculty be separated from the skin in emaciated persons, disappears altogether in those whose cellular tissue is distended by fat or serous effusion. Having made these remarks, I shall describe the superficial fascia in those regions only where it can be easily demonstrated, viz. in the lower part of the abdomen, and in the extremities. The Superficial Fascia of the Abdomen. This aponeurosis, from its constituting the first subcutaneous covering of hernise, has particularly engaged the attention of authors who have specially treated' of the pathological anatomy of those diseases. It becomes evident in the neighbourhood of the umbilical region, but is much more distinct at the fold of the groin, where it divides into two layers, one of which is attached to the femoral arch, and the other is prolonged upon the lower extremity. It is bounded on the inside by the median line, and on the outside bv another line, extending perpendicularly upwards from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium. It is prolonged over the inguinal rms and over the spermatic cord in the male subject. it has been said that in the foetus, before the descent of the testicle the su- perficial fascia dips into the inguinal canal, and forms an infundibuhform pro- * TAflinnso tissue is never deposited in the subcutaneous tissue oftlic eyelids, nor in the male organ of'^encrS!^'^^^ parts, however, may become mueh distended from serous mfil- tration.]THE CRANIAL APONEUROSES. 391 longation, reaching up to the lower part of that gland ; and the dartos has been supposed to relult from the expansion of this fascia-a description ^vhlch can be regai-ded only as an ingenious speculation, which has not been confirmed \Sy, ?he external surface of the superficial fascia of the abdomen is in re- lation with the skin, separated from it, however, by a layer of adipose tissue of variable thickness, in which the subcutaneous vessels and nerves are situ- ated. Its deep surface corresponds with the aponeurosis of the external ob- lique muscle, and with a portion of its fleshy fibres : from these parts it is separated by a layer of serous ceUular tissue, which enables it to be moved easily upon this muscle and the subcutaneous vessels and nerves. The Superficial Fascia of the Upper and Lower Extremities. These are thin fibrous sheaths, separated from the skin by a greater or less quantity of adipose tissue, and from the investing aponeurosis of the muscles by the subcutaneous vessels and nerves. It does not exist around the joints, nor in the pahns of the hands and soles of the feet, for in these places the skin adheres to the subjacent aponeuroses. The Aponeuroses of the Cranium. The Occipito-frontal or Epi-cranial Aponeurosis. This is a sort of tendinous or cutaneous cap (£alea capitis), stretched between the two frontal and two occipital muscles. Its superficial surface is intimately adherent to the skin, by means of very short and strong fibrous prolongations, between which the fatty matter is deposited: the frontal, occipital, temporal, and auricular vessels and nerves, traverse this adipose tissue. Its deep surface glides upon the periosteum of the skull {pericranium), by the intei-vention of a very delicate cellular tissue, in which fat is never found. Its anterior margin receives the fibres of the frontal muscles, forming a triangular point between them; its posterior margin receives the fibres of the occipital muscles, and also occupies the interval between them. These two muscles act as tensors of the aponeurosis. Its outer margin gives attachment to the superior and ante- rior auricular muscles. It is composed behind of shining fibres, which seem to form a tendon of insertion to the occipitalis muscle, but it soon loses its pearly appearance, and becomes more adherent to the skin: it is thick and strong at the upper part of the head, but thin and almost cellular at the sides: it may be regarded as a dependence of the superficial fascia. It gives rise to the tension which is so common and so dangerous in inflammations of this region. Its adhesion to the skin explains the shallow character of ulcers, and the flatness of the small abscesses occurring in these parts. The Temporal Aponeurosis. Besides the tendinous origin of the temporal muscle, which has been already described, there is also a very strong investing aponeurosis, arising from the upper border of the zygomatic arch, and inserted into the curved line bound- ing the temporal fossa above. This aponeurosis completes the sort of case in which the muscle is contained; and the space between it and the temporal fossa corresponds with the thickness of the muscle. It difiers from the epicranial aponeurosis, which is more superficial and covers it superiorly, in not adhering to the skin, which glides very easily upon it. Its deep surface adheres to the upper part of the muscle, and furnishes it with numerous points of attachment; below it becomes free, and is separated from the fleshy fibres by a considerable quantity of fat; hence the depression formed in this situation in emaciated persons. It increases in thickness from above downwards ; it divides below into two layers—one superficial and thinner, inserted into the outer edge of the upper c c 4392 APONEUROLOGY. border of the zygoma; the other deep and thicker, attached to the inner sur- lace of that process. In tolerably stout persons a considerable quantity of fat IS situated between these two layers, and a remarkable branch of the temporal artery also occupies the same situation. This fat must not be confounded with the larger mass which lies beneath the aponeuroses. The resistance of this fascia explains the reason why abscesses in the temporal fossa never point out- wards, but rather tend downwards into the zygomatic fossa. The Aponeukoses of the Face. The Parotid Aponeurosis. This is a sheath of great thickness, especially that part which covers the outer surface of the gland; it is continuous below with the cervical fascia. It belongs especially to the gland, for which it forms a framework by means of fibrous prolongations from its deep surface. The density of this sheath explains both the pain caused by inflammation of the gland, and the diflSculty with which pus makes its way from within it to the surface. The Masseteric Aponeurosis. This is a thin tendinous layer covering the masseter muscle, and continuous below with the cervical fascia; it appears to divide behind into two layers, one of which constitutes the parotid fascia, and the other penetrates between that gland and the masseter; above and anteriorly it becomes merged into the cel- lular tissue. Purulent matter situated beneath this fascia tends downwards into the neck, but when situated superficially to it points towards the skin. The Buccinator Aponeurosis. The buccinator is covered by a closely adherent fibrous layer, which is regarded as the expansion of the fibrous sheath of the Stenonian duct; it is thickest behind, where it is termed the buccinato-pharyngeal aponeurosis, because it gives attachment behind to the superior constrictor of the pharynx, and to the buccinator in fi'ont. This aponeurosis prevents superficial abscesses from opening into the mouth, and is also opposed to the extension outwards of diseases attacking the mucous membrane. The Cekvicai, Aponeurosis, or Ceryicai Fascia. In the cervical region we find, 1. the cervical fascia; 2. the prevertebral aponeurosis. The Cervical Fascia. The cervical aponeurosis covers the whole anterior region of the neck; it extends from the base of the lower jaw to the sternum and clavicles, and is insensibly lost on either side in the subcutaneous cellular tissue. It is thick in the median line, and forms a sort of cervical linea alba. From this linea alba two layers proceed in the supra-hyoid region, and four in the infra-hyoid region, which are arranged in the following manner: — 1. The superficial layer, or the superficial cervical fascia, covers the whole anterior and lateral regions of the neck, is prolonged downwards in front of the clavicle, to become continuous with the pi-oper aponeurosis of the pectoralis major, is attached above to the masseteric and parotid fasciae, and, internally to the masseter muscle, is fixed to the base of the lower jaw. It fills up the interval between the two platysmata, and is prolonged behind these muscles to form the anterior layer of the sheath of the sterno-mastoid. The external jugular vein is superficial to this layer in the sub-hyoid, and lies beneath it in the supra-hyoid region.393 THE INTERCOSTAL APONEUROSIS. 2. The deep layer passes beneath the sterno-mastoid, on the outer border of -which it unites with the preceding layer, and completes the sheath for that muscle. It covers the internal jugular vein, the common carotid artei7, the pneumogastric nerve, the great sympathetic, and its cervical ganglia. Its upper margin is attached to the base of the lower jaw ; its lower margin to the posterior surface of the clavicle, and to the posterior edge of the fourchette of the sternum. It is necessary to examine this deep layer, both in the supra- and sub-hyoid region. In the supra-hyoid region its middle portion is very strong, and occupies the triangular space between the anterior bellies of the digastric muscles: it is fixed by its lower margin to the os hyoides, and on each side to the tendon of the digastricus. The lateral portions of this aponeurosis pass beneath the sub- maxillary glands, and are attached to the rami of the lower jaw. Externally to these glands they join the parotid aponeuroses, and form a tolerably thick septum between the submaxillary and parotid glands of either side. In the sub-hyoid region this deep layer is divided into three very distinct parts, a middle and two lateral. The middle is the stronger ; it occupies the triangular space between the two omo-hyoid muscles, and becomes continuous with their median tendons: the muscles may therefore be regarded as the tensors of this fascia. It binds down the muscles of the infra-hyoid region: its arrangement explains why abscesses situated in front of it discharge their contents through the skin, and not into the thorax, as those do that are sub- jacent to it. The lateral parts of the aponeurosis constitute the supra-clavicular fascia, a very strong layer, in which the superficial layer already described, and the two which yet remain to be noticed, all terminate. It occupies the whole triangular space between the trapezius and the sterno-mastoid, is con- tinuous with the fibro-cellular sheath of the former muscle, and adheres below to the clavicle. The latter circumstance is of great importance in relation to surgical anatomy. The superficial and deep layers which we have now described, are common to both the supra- and sub-hyoid regions. In the sub-hyoid region there are two other aponeurotic layers; one, very thin, sepai'ating the superficial from the deep muscles, i. e. the omo- and sterno-hyoidei from the stemo-thyroidei and thyro-hyoidei; the other, thicker, passing between the stemo-thyroidei and the trachea. The latter is the fourth layer which Godman incorrectly de- scribes as continuous with the pericardium. The Prevertebral Aponeurosis. This aponeurosis covers the muscles of the prevertebral region, viz. the longi colli and the great and small anterior recti: it is prolonged on each side upon the scaleni, the levator anguli scapulae, and the brachial plexus; and is attached to the upper border of the scapula, and to the outer half of the posterior border of the clavicle. It completely separates the axilla from the neck, and is perforated by several vessels. It prevents large abscesses of the neck trom opening into the axiUa ; and in caries of the cervical vertebra it retains the pus poured out against it, so as to form abscesses by accumulation. The Thoracic Aponeuroses. The Intercostal Aponeurosis. Independently of the semi-tendinous structure of the intercostal muscles, we nna several fibrous layers in each intercostal space ; one layer, in front, con- tinuous with the external intercostal muscle ; another, behind, continuous with tne internal intercostal muscles ; and, situated within these muscles, a third layer, which lines them and separates them from the pleura. The existence ot tnis subserous aponeurosis accounts for the rare occurrence of the burstingAPONEUROLOGY. 394 of an external abscess of the chest, into the cavity of the pleura; and on the other hand, of the escape of collections in the pleura by external openings. The Aponeurosis of the Serrati Postici. In the dorsal region of the trunk, we find a very thin fibrous layer (some- times called the vertebral aponeurosis), extending between the two sen-ati postici. It is of a quadrilateral form ; its inner margin is attached to the summits of the dorsal spinous processes ; its outer margin to the angles of the ribs; and its lower margin to the upper border of the serratus posticus inferior ; it seldom terminates at the lower border of the serratus posticus superior, but generally passes beneath it, and becomes the investing aponeurosis of the splenius. The use of this aponeurosis is evidently to confine the posterior spinal or long muscles of the back. The Abdominai, Aponeukoses. The parietes of the abdomen are partly muscular and partly aponeurotic: the muscular portions are situated at the sides of the abdomen. The apo- neurotic portions occupy the anterior and posterior regions, and form the anterior and posterior abdominal aponeuroses. The extensibility, elasticity, and above all the contractility of the abdominal parietes, depend on the three in- tersecting muscular layers ; whilst to the aponeuroses must be attributed their capability of resistance and want of extensibility. Tlie Anterior Abdominal Aponeurosis. The anterior abdominal aponeurosis forms the greater part of the anterior wall of the abdomen. It consists, 1. of a fibrous column, which is continuous with the osseous column of the sternum, and 2. of two perfectly corresponding halves, one right, the other left. These two halves are united in the linea alba, which may be regarded as their common origin. TTie Linea Alba. The linea alba (i,figs. 109, 110.) is a tendinous raphe, extending from the ensiform cartilage to the symphysis pubis ; it constitutes the anterior median line of the abdomen. In a theoretical point of view it may be regarded as a continuation of the sternum, which, in some animals, is prolonged as far as the pabes.* . » , Anatomists are not agreed as to the acceptation of the term linea alba. According to some it is a mathematical line produced by the intersection of the aponeuroses of one side with those of the other : according to others, and this meaning appears to me preferable, it consists of the tendinous band com- prised between the inner borders of the recti. Thus defined, the breadth of the linea alba corresponds to the mterval be- tween these muscles, and as they are directed somewhat obliquely upwards and outwards, it follows that the upper or supra-umbilical portion of the Unea alba is broader than that portion which is below the umbilicus. This remark- able arrangement, by which the strength of the lower part of the abdomen is secured affords an explanation of the uniform occui-rence of hernise through the linea alba above, not below, the umbilicus. It should also be observed that during exertion, the viscera are chiefly forced against the lower part ot the kbdominal parietes, and also that the gravid uterus rests upon it. The sub-umbilical portion of the linea alba forms a mere Lne, while the • The amioffv has even been carried so far, that the tendinous intersections of the recti have been compa?i/tl the Hbs. for they seem to come off from the linea alba like abdommal r.bs.THE LINEA ALBA. 395 supra-umbilical is about a quarter of an inch in breadth Its transverse di- mensions are much increased in persons whose abdomen has been greatly dis- tended. Thus, during and after pregnancy and certain dropsies, it m some cases acquires a considerable breadth, and does not return to its original size even after the distension has ceased to exist. In a female who died a short time after deUvery, I found the linea alba three inches across at the ^^ilicus. and fifteen lines in the narrowest part. In cases of this kmd the hnea alba forms a sort of long pouch, which receives the mtestmes, and becomes very prominent dm-ine the contraction of the recti. The linea alba presents several elUptical openings for the passage of nerves and vessels. In these foramina round masses of fat are developed, which dilate them, and drawdown the peritoneum into them, or are absorbed m consequence of emaciation, and thus open an easy way for the production ot hernia of the linea alba. Of aU these orifices, the most remarkable is the umbilical ring, which gives passage to the umbUical vessels in the fcetus, but becomes cicatrised after birth, at least in the majority of subjects. _ The situation of the umbilicus varies at different ages. The middle point of the length of the body is situated above the umbilicus before the sixth month of fcetal existence, and corresponds with it after that period. In the adult it is situated below the umbilicus. Its situation with regard to the abdomen varies in different individuals. Thus, the umbilical cicatrix, which is generally a little below the middle of the abdomen, is sometimes exactly in the middle. I have even seen it at the point of junction of the lower with the upper two-thirds. This cicatrix, moreover, is much stronger than the neighbouring _ parts. Thus, an umbilical hernia, which in a new-born infant always occupies the navel itself, in an adult is almost invariably situated a little above the umbi- licus. Still it occasionally yields, either in cases of dropsy, or of hernia; and I have records of several instances of hernia in the adult, that have oc- curred through the umbilical ring. The linea alba is in relation, in front, with the skin, which adheres more closely to it than to the neighbouring parts, especially opposite the umbilicus. In the male it is separated from the skin below by the suspensory ligament of the penis, which sometimes extends as far as the middle of the space be- tween the pubes and the umbilicus: behind, it is in relation with the perito- neum, separated from it, however, by the remains of the urachus, and by the bladder itself, when that viscus is distended. It is, then, through the linea alba that the bladder is punctured in cases of retention of urine, and that the incision is made in the high operation of lithotomy. The peritoneum does not adhere more closely to the umbilicus than to the other parts of the abdo- men, and therefore umbilical hernise, like all others, are invariably provided with a proper sac. The upper extremity of the linea alba is attached to the ensiform appendix, a flexible, elastic, cartilaginous body, constituting, as it were, a transitional structure between the sternum and the part we are now describing. The lower extremity corresponds to the symphysis pubis. K we examine the structure of the linea alba, we shall see that it is formed by the intersection of the layers of the anterior abdominal aponeuroses. One remarkable circumstance is, that the intersecting fibres do not stop at the median line, but pass from one side to the other ; so that the tendinous fibres of the external oblique of the right side, become the tendinous fibres of the internal oblique of the left; and again, that the intersection occurs not only from side to side, but also from before ,backwards. Below the umbilicus the point of intersection is elevated by some longitudinal fibres, constituting a * Some cases are on record of the persistence ot the umbilical vein, and consequently of the umbilical ring.

We may add, that the fibres of the linea alba have no re- semblance to the yellow elastic tissue ; they are neither extensible nor elastic, at least in the human subject. Its uses entirely refer to its capability of offer- ing resistance. The pyramidales are its tensor muscles. The Four Layers of the Anterior Abdominal Aponeurosis. From each side of the linea albU {a, fig. 134., a diagram representing a ho- rizontal section of the abdominal parietes) two fibrous layers proceed outwards,—one anteriorly, the other posteriorly, to the rectus muscle (r). The anterior layer (6) having arrived near the outer border of the muscle, subdivides into two other layers,—one superficial, constituting the aponeurosis of the external oblique {d); the other deep, forming the anterior layer of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique (e). The % " posterior layer (c) is also simple as far as the outer border of the rectus, and then separates likewise into two layers,—one anterior, which becomes united with the aponeurosis of the in- ternal oblique (e), and is regarded as the pos- terior layer of that aponeurosis ; the other posterior, which continues its course outwards from the rectus, and forms the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle (/). We shall describe these different parts in succession. The aponeurosis of the external oblique. This is the most superficial layer, and is of a quadrilateral figure (a, fig. 109.); it is broad below, where it cor- responds to the interval between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium and the linea alba, becomes narrower immediately above, and again expands at the upper part, but to a less extent than below. It is covered by the skin and the superficial fascia, and it covers the apo- neurosis and the anterior portion of the fleshy fibres of the internal oblique. It adheres intimately to the aponeurosis of the internal oblique, as far as the vicinity of the outer border of the rectus, excepting below, where the two fasciae are perfectly distinct, and can be easily separated throughout their en- tire extent. Its external margin, slightly concave and denticulated, presents irregular prolongations, with which the fleshy fibres become continuous. A line extend- ing from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium to the extrem- ity of the cartilage of the eighth rib, will indicate with tolerable accuracy the direction of this margin, which appears to be divided into two layers,—one superficial, very thin, and continuous with the proper cellulo-fibrous sheath of the muscle; the other deep, and giving origin to fleshy fibres. Its upper margin is narrow, and cannot be exactly defined; it often gives attachment to some fibres of the pectoralis major. Its lower margin consists of two very distinct portions,—one extendmgfrom the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium to the spine of the os pubis, is caUed the femoral arch (p p',figs. 136, 137.) ; the other, stretching between the spine and the symphysis pubis, of^^rs for consideration the pillars and the ■cutaneous orifice of the 2njf«jWca7ia/(m,,^(7S. 109. 136, 137.). The aponeurosis of the external oblique is composed of tendinous fasciculi, directed obliquely downwards and inwards, like the fleshy fibres with which they are continuous. It is also perforated, especially in the neighbourhood of397 THE CRURAL ARCH. Not the linea alba, by a considerable number of bloodvessels and nerves, frequently the component fasciculi have between them especially near he femoril arch, Unear or triangular spaces of variable size, through which the fibres of the internal oblique are visible. The component fasciculi are also interspcted at riffht angles, and as it were bound down, by other tendinous S Swcf a^e mor^or L developed in different individuals, and are most usuaUy situated in the neighbourhood of the femoral arch. Having made these preliminary observations we shall now describe in detail 1. the lower margin of the aponeurosis of the external obhque or the femoral arch; and 2. the inguinal ring and canal. . „ ^ i ■ui;^,,^ The femoral, or crural, arch. When the aponeui-osis of the external obhque has arrived opposite aUne extending from the anterior superior spmous process of the ilium to the spine of the pubes, it suddenly terminates, becomes thickened and is reflected (a a', ;?^.137.) from before backwards upon itself. The reflected border ^5fs. 136, 137.) has been vari- ously denominated the femoral or crural arch, the reflected margin of the tendon of the external oblique, Poupart's ligament, and the ligament of Fallopius. This arch, which is stretched like a cord, corresponds to the fold of the groin, and defines the limits of the abdomen and the lower extremity : it forms the anterior border of a consider- able triangular space, which is completed by the ilium {\,fig. 136.) on the outside, and by the OS pubis (2) be- hind. This space establishes a communication between the lower extremity and the abdomen, and is occupied (proceeding from without inwards) by the psoas and iliacus muscle (i to i), the crural nerve (n), the femoral artery (a) and vein (v), and the pectineus muscle. * The crural arch is directed somewhat obliquely downwards and inwards ; and as its outer third is more oblique than the inner two thirds, it describes ex- ternally a slight curve, having its concavity directed upwards. Its lower or reflected border is continuous with the fascia of the thigh. This adhesion occa- sions the tension of the arch, as may be shown by cutting the femoral fascia at the point of its junction with the arch: hence the precept of Scarpa, who re- commended incisions to be made in this situation, in order to relieve the con- striction in femoral hernia. The free margin of the reflected portion of the aponeurosis, of which the femoral arch consists, is continued backwards into the iliac fascia («') ex- ternally ; and internally, into the fascia transversalis (0- Externally near the psoas and iliacus, (beyond a', fig.\37.) the posterior or reflected portion of the arch is closely blended with its anterior or direct por- * This is not represented in the woodcut.APONEUROLOGY. 398 tion, as -well as with the iliac fascia and the fascia of the thigh, so that in this situation there is a thickening rather than an actual reflection of the aponeu- rosis. Internally to the psoas and iliacus, however (at a), the direct and reflected portions are perfectly distinct, and form a groove with its concavity upwards, which we shaU find to assist in the formation of the inguinal canal. These two separate portions of the inner part of the femoral arch require a special description. The direct portion (part of which is shown turned downwards at d,fig. 137.), passes on to be attached to the spine of thepubes {p,figs. 136,137.),becomingmore and more prominent, so that it can be easily felt under the skin, especially when the thigh is extended upon the pelvis. The reflected portion, externally, is narrow, and as it were folded ; but internally it becomes expanded, from its fibres slightly changing their direction, and diverging, so as to be inserted into the spine of the pubes behind the direct portion, and also into the pecten or crest of the pubes. This reflected and expanded portion, described even in the oldest anatomical works, has become celebrated in recent times under the improper name of Gimbernat's ligament (g,fig. 136.), from a Spanish surgeon, who pointed out its importance as the seat of stricture in femoral hernia. It is triangular in shape; its anterior margin corresponds to the crural arch; its posterior margin to the crest of the pubes ; its outer margin is free, concave, tense, and sharp, and forms the inner part of the circumference of the crural ring (r). This con- cavity, against which the protruded intestine becomes strangulated, has ob- tained for the ligament the name of the falciform ligament or fold* Its strength is very considerable; but occasionally intervals are left between its fibres, through which hernial protrusions may take place.f From the lower surface of Gimbernat's ligament a fibrous prolongation is given off, which sometimes represents a second arch below the fenioral arch, and assists in forming the superficial layer of the fascia lata of the thigh. This tendinous expansion has a great effect in rendering the arch tense. We may add, that there is considerable variation in different subjects, both in the strength and developement of Gimbernat's ligament; varieties that must have great influence on the position of crural hemiae, and on the seat of strangulation m that disease. Behind the femoral arch, on the outer side of Gimbernat's Uga- ment, is an opening (a to r, fig. 136.) or ring, intended to give passage to the femoral artery (a) and vein (v), and to a great number of lymphatic vessels and glands : this is the crural ring-X The sub-peritoneal cellular tissue some- times acquires great strength opposite this ring, and constitutes what is called the crural septum (situated at r). The form of the crural ring is that of an isosceles triangle, the base of which is very long, and formed by the crural arch, the inner border by the pectineus, and the outer by the psoas and iliacus muscles. Of the three angles the internal is rounded, and corresponds to the concave mar- oin of Gimbernat's ligament; the external angle, opposite which the epigastric artery is situated, is very acute, and corresponds to the point at which the ie- moral arch separates from the iliac fascia; the posterior angle is very obtuse, and corresponds to the ilio-pectineal eminence (d). , , , c The femoral vein is in relation with the inner or pectineal border ot this triangular space; the femoral artery with the iUo-pectineal eminence and the » [This term is noiv generaUy applied (after Burns) to the external margin of the saphenous "^^WZ\&r^h3:sUtZ^^eZrd^^^^ of hernia through the fibres of Gimbernat's ligament.

On the inner side of the spme of the os pubis, between the spine and the symphysis, the aponeurosis of the external obhque divides into two almost paraUel, or at least very shghtly diverging, bands, which leave between them an opening for the passage of the spermatic cord m the male, and of the round ligament in the female. This opening is the in- guinal ring (m, figs. 109. 136, 137.), and the bands which form its hmits are called the pillars (o p, figs. 136, 137.). The inguinal ring is oval or trian- gular ; its greatest diameter has the same direction as the fibres of the external oblique, viz. obliquely downwards and inwards. Its base corresponds to the interval between the spine and symphysis pubis. Its apex is not always well defined, and is generally truncated by fibres which pass at right angles to its pillars. From the upper part of the margin of the ring a tendinous prolong- ation is given ofi", which accompanies the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female. Of the pillars one is external or inferior, the other internal or superior. The external pillar {p) is attached, not to the spine of the os pubis, but into the fore part of the symphysis : this pillar is nothing more than the internal ex- tremity of the direct portion of the femoral arch. Moreover, some anatomists consider Gimbernat's ligament as the reflected portion of the external pillar. The internal pillar (o) is broader than the external, and intersects the cor- responding structure of the opposite side in front of the symphysis, not unfre- quently some fibres of the right internal pillar intersecting those of the left external pillar. • See note, p- 398.APONEUROLOGY. Inguinal canal or passage. The inguinal ri?ig (in) is the anterior or cuta- neous orifice of an oblique passage, formed in the substance of the lower edge of the inferior parietes of the abdomen opposite the crural arch, and destined to transmit the cord («) of the spermatic vessels in the male, and the round ligament of the uterus in the female. This passage, which modern writers only have correctly described, has been styled by them the inguinal canal (t c m). Its length varies from an inch and a half to two inches and a half; it is di- rected obliquely downwards, forwards, and inwards. The inguinal canal is formed in reality by the groove resulting from the reflection backwards of the aponeurosis of the external oblique (at a), the posterior border of which groove is continuous with the fascia transversalis, and its anterior border with the aponeurosis of the external oblique itself. We may then consider this passage as having an inferior concave wall (at a) formed by the groove of reflection; an anterior wall, formed by the aponeurosis of the external oblique (shown turned downwards at d) ; and a posterior wall, formed by the fascia transversalis (c). There is no superior wall, or rather it is supplied by the lower margins of the internal oblique (e) and transversalis (/) muscles, ■which occupy the groove of the crural arch, and receive from it externally numerous points of attachment. Internally the margins of these muscles are separated from the groove by the spermatic cord, or the round ligament. It has been supposed that this canal is lined by a funnel-shaped prolongation of the fascia transversalis. The peritoneal or internal orifice (t. Jigs. 110. 137.) of the inguinal canal is much less accurately defined than the external, or rather its inner border alone is well defined, consisting of a concave fibrous edge formed by the fascia transversalis, and somewhat analogous to the concave edge of Gimbernat's ligament. The strangulation of the intestine in inguinal hernia sometimes occurs against this edge. The peritoneal orifice of the inguinal canal is closed by the peritoneum, and the epigastric artery runs along its inner border. The testicle, which is originally situated within the abdomen, descends through the inguinal canal; so also do those herniae, commonly called oblique inguinal hernise, in order to distinguish them from the direct or internal inguinal hernise. The anterior aponeuroses of the ohliquus internus and transversalis. The apo- neurosis of the internal oblique commences at the Unea alba, and immediately divides in its upper three fourths into two layers, one of which passes in front, and the other behind the rectus {r,fig. 134.). The lower fourth passes entirely in front of the same muscle without division (as shown in fig. 135.). The anterior layer is very closely united with the aponeurosis of the external oblique (at b), from which it can be distinguished only by the direction of its fibres. In some parts there is even a true interlacement between the tendinous fibres of these two muscles; the lower or undivided portion of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique may, on the contrary, be easily separated from that of the external oblique. The posterior layer of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique is no less intimately blended with that of the transversalis (at c), from which, also, it is to be distinguished by the direction of its fibres only. At the outer border of the rectus muscle the anterior layer of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique separates from that of the external oblique, and the posterior layer from that of the transversalis, and then immediately unite together, and give origin to the fleshy fibres. The outer margin, therefore, of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique exactly con-esponds to the outer border of the rectus, and is directed vertically. - . , ■, ^ i The aponeurosis of the transversalis (ffigs. 134, 135.) is the deepest layer of the anterior abdominal aponeurosis : it is very narrow above, increases in breadth as far down as opposite the crest of the ilium, and then progressively diminishes towards its lower portion. It commences at the Unea alba, and is divided into two portions,—one inferior (below s,fig. 110.), consisting only otTHE FASCIA TRANSVERSALIS. 401 the lower fourth of the aponeuroses, and passing in front of the rectus (as in Jig. 135.); the other superior (above s, fig. 110.), which passes behind the rectus (as mjig. 134.), and is formed by the upper three fourths of the apo- neurosis. Its external margin is convex, and gives origin to the fleshy fibres of the muscle. Its anterior surface is closely united to the aponeurosis of the internal oblique, beyond which it passes on the outside : its posterior surface is loosely connected with the peritoneum, excepting in its lower fourth, which, as already stated, passes in front of the rectus muscle. The tendinous fibres of the transversalis, which have the same direction as its fleshy fibres, are oc- ca.sionally found not to terminate abruptly behind the lower part of the rectus ; but the aponeurosis merely becomes thinner, and its fasciculi separated from each other. The Fascia Transversalis and Sub-peritoneal Aponeurosis. In order to complete the description of the anterior abdominal aponeurosis, it only remains for me to describe the fascia transversalis, which I regard as a I thickened portion of the sub-peritoneal fascia. The fascia transversalis (seen at a' and c,fig. 137.) was first pointed out by Sir Astley Cooper, but has been more correctly described by Lawrence and J. Cloquet: it commences below at the reflected border (a a') of the crural arch, so that it may be regarded as a thin prolongation of the reflected portion of the tendon of the external oblique. It also frequently arises from the brim of the pelvis, as weU as from the crural arch. From these points it passes upwards, becoming more and more attenuated as it approaches the umbilicus, at which point it cannot be distinguished from the sub-peritoneal aponeu- rosis. The fascia transversalis is situated between the abdominal muscles and the peritoneum. Its internal margin is continuous with the outer border of the rectus muscle ; and its external margin, which gradually becomes thinner, is blended with the sub-peritoneal aponeurosis. The only part deserving a special description, is that portion which lies between the outer border of the rectus muscle and the abdominal opening of the inguinal canal. In this si- tuation it assists in strengthening the parietes of the abdomen, -which are here remarkably weak ; and it is to the existence of this fascia that we may attri- bute the extreme rarity of direct inguinal hernise *, which, in fact, can only result from a congenital weakness, or a relaxation of this fascia. A very interesting portion of the fascia transversalis is an infundibuliform prolongation, given off fi-om it to the spermatic cord. It is impossible, in- deed, to conceive the descent of the testicle to occur without its pushing before it a portion of the fascia, which then constitutes the immediate investment of the cord, upon which the cremaster muscle (Jb,fig. 137.) is spread out. The peritoneal orifice of the inguinal canal is, therefore, the superior opening of the infundibuliform process, furnished by the fascia transversalis to the tes- ticle and its cord. The Sub-peritoneal Aponeurosis. The peritoneum, throughout the whole extent of the abdominal parietes, is strengthened on its outer surface by a very thin tendinous layer, the existence of which may serve to explain why abscesses, formed in the parietes of the abdomen, so seldom open into the cavity of the peritoneum; and on the other hand, why collections within the peritoneal cavity so seldom open externally. - * f ■ ^"""'^ occurring dir(!c% downwards and forwards tliroiigli the inguinal rine (m 78^.1.37.), and not di'scending along the inguinal cnn«/.] ® ' vol,. I.402 APONEUROLOGY. The Posterior Abdominal Aponeurosis. The posterior abdominal aponeurosis is much smaller and of less importance than the anterior : it consists of three layers, one anterior {h, in diagram, fig. 134.), and very thin, which commences at the base of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and passes in front of the quadratus lumborum (17) ; another, middle (i), and much stronger, commencing at the summits of the same transverse processes, and passing behind the quadratus lumborum ; and a third, posterior (A), -which arises from the summits of the lumbar spinous processes, and passes behind the sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, and transverso-spinalis muscles (s). This last mentioned layer is connected both -with the internal oblique (e) and -with the transversalis muscles (/), and is blended -with the aponeuroses of the serratus posticus inferior, and of the la- tissimus dorsi (I). The two anterior layers are connected with the transver- salis only. The posterior abdominal aponeurosis has, therefore, nearly the same relation to the quadratus lumborum and the common mass of the sacro- lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, and transverso-spinalis muscles, that the anterior aponeurosis has to the rectus muscle. The Lumbo-iliac Aponeurosis. The lumbo-iliac aponeurosis, or fascia iliaca of modem authors, forms the tendinous sheaths of the abdominal portion of the psoas and iliacus muscles, and is therefore bifurcated at its upper part. That portion which invests the psoas commences at the tendinous arch of the diaphragm, already described as em- bracing the upper end of this muscle. The iliac portion arises from the whole extent of the inner border of the crest of the ilium. The circumflex ilu artery is situated in the substance of this iUac portion, at its ongm. The internal margin of the fascia iliaca is attached to the sides of the lumbar vertebra;, and lower down to the brim of the pelvis: it is arranged in arches, which give nassage to the lumbar vessels and to the nervous cords, establishing a com- munication between the lumbar plexus and the lumbar ganglia of the sympa- thetic nerve. The centre of each arch is opposite to the groove on one of the bodies of the lumbar vertebra, the intervals between the arches corresponding with the intervertebral substance. The largest arch extends from the last lumbar vertebra to the brim of the pelvis, and is opposite to the base of the sacrum. The obturator and lumbo-sacral nerves pass under it. Opposite the femoral arch, the fascia iliaca adheres intimately to the outer part of Poupart's ligament; but towards the median line it separates from that ligament, passes behind the femoral vessels, and forms the posterior half %'£titZ7lv^%e fascia is prolonged upon the thigh; on the out- side S) t completes the sheath of the psoas and ilmcus, accompanies them as far as the lesser trochanter, and becomes continuous with the ihac portion Ta fia 137 ) of the femoral fascia; on the inside, it forms the posterior wall ?sfiQ 136 ) of the canal for the femoral vessels, and forms the deep layer or xn ^<>'''''i''fZ^''l'XSX^^ are subjacent to this fascia, excepting one trv'sma 1 cord ^hir^erfSes it at the side of the sacrum and becomes verj small cora, ^""^ J; , rpiliilar tissue The femoral vessels are situated Structure, i he iPP^r P^" fpmoral arch It is formed of well marked in tWckness as It appro^^^^^^^^^^ ^ „f the psoas403 THE DEEP PERINEAL APONEUROSIS. D D 2 is distinguished from it only by the different direction of its fibres ; it is in- serted by spreading out at the side of the pelvic brim into a tendinous arch ■which lines this brim, and with -which the psoas parvus and the ihac fascia are continuous above, and the pelvic fascia below. Few aponeuroses are more deserving the attention of anatomists than this, on account of the practical consequences resulting from its arrangement. In fact, notwithstanding its tenuity, it forms a boundary between the sub-perito- neal and sub-aponeurotic cellular tissue, which is very rarely passed by inflam- matory action. When inflammation terminates in suppuration, the pus, whether it be beneath the peritoneum, or beneath this fascia, descends towards the fe- moral arch ; but if the inflammation be sub-peritoneal, the femoral vessels lie behind the purulent collection; and should it be sub-aponeurotic, the vessels will be in front of it. The latter is especially the case in abscesses, following caries of the vertebrae. The Aponeuroses of the Pelvis. The aponeuroses of the pelvis should be distinguished into the pelvic, properly so called, and the perineal: the former constitute essential parts of the pelvis, and are deeply seated. The others belong to that part of the floor of the pelvis which is called the perineum. I shall commence with the description of the latter. The Aponeuroses of the Perineum. These are two in number, —one superficial, the other deep. The Superficial Perineal Fascia.* Dissection. Remove the subcutaneous adipose tissue very cautiously, layer by layer, commencing the dissection along the edges of the pubic arch. Thjs aponeurosis (which is very distinct from the fibrous laminae, intercept- ing spaces filled by fat, and forming what is called the fascia superficialis), is of a triangular shape, and consists of well marked transverse fibres. The outer margin of each half of the fascia is attached to the descending ramus of the OS pubis and the ascending ramus of the ischium: its inner margin is lost at the raphe, along the median line : its posterior margin is bounded by a line, extending from the tuberosity of the ischium to the anus; it corresponds with the posterior edge of the transversus perinei muscle, and appears to be reflected behind it, so as to line the corresponding perineal or ischio-rectal fossa.f Relations. It is covered by a prolongation of the dartos, to a greater extent in the median line than on each side; also by the subcutaneous adipose tissue, which is thicker behind than in front, and by the sphincter ani, above which it terminates in the median line : it covers the transversus, the bulbo-caver- nosus, and the ischio-cavernosus muscles, the fibrous sheaths of which may even be regarded as a prolongation of this aponeurosis. It also covers the superficial perineal vessels and nerves, which are sometimes lodged within its substance. The existence of this membrane explains why, in cases of per- foration of the urethra, the urine is infiltrated forwards, and very rarely backwards. The Deep Perineal Aponeurosis. Dissection. Remove with great care the ischio- and bulbo-cavernosus and the transversus perinei muscles. This aponeurosis, which was well described by M. Carcassone under the name of perineal ligament, and called by modern writers the middle perineal fascia, appears to me perfectly distinct from the aponeuroses of the pelvis.

It is ver- tical near the arch, as far as the ball of the urethra, below ■which it becomes horizontal, or ra- ther oblique, from before backwards. Its lateral margins are attached to the descending rami of the ossa pubis, and the ascending rami of the ischia (rf </), above the attachment of the ischio-cavernosi muscles. Its posterior margin, becomes blended with the posterior margin of the superficial perineal fascia, behmd the transversi muscles, in front of the perineal fossse, of which it forms the anterior boundary. Relations. Its lower surface is in relation with the ischio- and bulbo-caver- nosus muscles, and gives off in the median line a fibrous septum, which passes between these muscles, and affords them points of attachment. Its upper sur- face is in relation with the artery or arteries (e e) of the bulb, which are sometimes contained within its substance : it is also in contact with a very re- markable plexus of large veins, with which it is very closely united, so that when divided they remain open : these veins are also frequently enclosed within its substance. It is also in relation with the levator am. There constantly exists another transverse muscle, very distinct froni the transversus perinei generally described, which is situated further behind. This muscle (transversus perinei alter, Alb.) is applied to the lower surface ot the perineal fascia, and passes transversely inwards to the bulbous portion of the urethra. , , , , ■ . The deep fascia of the perineum is perforated (at c) by the posterior pait of the bulb of the urethra, or rather by the point of umon(c,^jr. 181.) between its bulbous and membranous portions: it gives off prolongations upon the sides ot the bulb, and serves to support the membranous portion of the urethra: wbence the name, triangular ligament of the urethra, given to it by CoUes. It is also perforated beneath the arch of the pubes by a great number of vems, and by ^""c/seT^'This remarkable aponeurosis evidently supports the canal of the urethra.

The Superior Pelvic Aponeurosis, or Becto-vesical Fascia. Dissection. This aponeurosis must be studied both from the cavity of the pelvis and from the perineum. It is exposed in the pelvis by removing the peritoneum, and the loose cellular tissue beneath that membrane : this should be done without any cutting instrument. To view this fascia from the peri- neum, it is necessary to take away the adipose tissue that occupies the perineal fossse, and also the levator ani muscle. The superior pelvic aponeurosis forms a complete floor for the pelvis. An- teriorly it is remarkable for its strength and shortness; in fact, it does not reach the inlet in this situation, but arises on each side from the symphysis pubis, presenting the appearance of bands or columns, which are more or less separated from each other, and become attached to the front of the neck of the bladder whence the name of anterior ligament of the bladder, which the older anatomists gave to this part of the aponeurosis. More externally it forms a strong arch (the sub-pubic arch), which completes the posterior orifice of the obturator or sub-pubic canal {i, fig. 48.). This arch is not unfrequently double, and then one of the foramina gives passage to vessels, and the other to nerves. Still more externally it is attached to the brim of the pelvis, in the manner I have already pointed out. Posteriorly it is extremely thin, passes in front of the sciatic plexus, and is lost upon the sacrum. Sometimes it appears to be divided into two laminae, the posterior of which passes in front of the sciatic plexus, and the anterior in front of the internal iliac vessels, to which it would seem to furnish sheaths. Relations. Its upper surface is concave, and connected with the peritoneum by loose cellular tissue, containing more or less fat. Its lower surface is convex, and covered by the levator ani: it forms part of the great perineal excavation, and is in relation with the pyrLformis and obturator internus muscles, with the sacral plexus, &c. This aponeurosis is perforated by a great number of openings: in the male . it is pierced by the prostate {i,fig. 181.) and the bladder (Ji), on the sides of which it is prolonged and reflected on to the rectum, whence the name of the recto-vesical aponeurosis, given to it by M. Carcassone. In the female it is also perforated by the vagina. On each side of the bladder and prostate it is strengthened by two tendinous bands, which run from before backwards. These are sometimes very strong; they extend from the symphysis pubis (6), to the spine of the ischium (e), pass along the bladder and the prostate, and are reflected upon their sides. In front, it has some openings for the vesical and prostatic vessels. Behind, it presents a considerable opening, which corresponds to the out- let of the pelvis, and gives passage to the lumbo-sacral nerve and the glu- teal vessels. The extremity of the arch formed by it corresponds to the ante- rior border of the sciatic notch. It is through this opening that sciatic hernise protrude. We not uncommonly find larger or smaller openings in this fascia, of an oblong or circular shape, leading into conical culs-de-sac, which are filled with fat. Lastly, it is perforated behind by the ischiatic and internal pudic ves- sels. It does not appear to be intended for the passage of the vessels which are distributed in the interior of the pelvis, for it seems to invest these in fibrous sheaths.406 APONEUROLOGY. Uses. The superior pelvic aponeurosis forms the floor of the pelvis; it is puslied downwards by the action of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles, and tends to prevent the occurrence of perineal herniaj, which otherwise would be extremely common : it forms a boundary between the sub-peritoneal and the perineal cellular tissue, and also limits the progress of inflammation and infiltrations. Infiltration of urine above the fascia can only be caused by rup • tui-e of the bladder itself. The prostate (i, fig. 181.) is almost entirely below the fascia, and therefore in the lateral operation for stone, in which this gland is the principal structure to be divided, inflammation and infiltration of the cel- lular tissue are extremely rare. When they do occur, the section or laceration must have been prolonged into the body of the bladder. TJie Lateral Pelvic Aponeurosis, or Fascia of the Obturator Muscle. Dissection. This aponeurosis is more advantageously studied, at least in its most important part, from the perineum, than from the cavity of the pelvis : it is exposed on either side by removing the adipose tissue, which fills up the perineal fossa. This aponeurosis, which is quite distinct from the obturator ligament, commences at the upper part of the circumference of the obturator foramen and at the brim of the pelvis, in conuection with the superior pelvic aponeurosis, which it soon leaves, and is applied to the obturator internus muscle; it then unites below with the reflected portion of the great sacro- sciatic ligament, and is prolonged upon that portion of the anterior surface of the glutffius maximus which projects beyond the ligament, and also upon the coccygeus muscle. Relations. On the inner side and above it is only separated from the supe- rior pelvic aponeurosis by the levator ani, which is applied to that aponeurosis; lower down, the two aponeuroses are separated by a considerable interval, which is occupied by fat: this interval forms the perineal fossa. On the outside it is in contact with the obturator internus, and lower down with the internal pudic vessels and nerves. Uses. It binds down the obturator internus muscle, and protects the mternal pudic vessels and nerves, which are therefore rarely cut in operations in the perineum. It forms the external boundary of the perineal fossa. The perineal fossm. Situated between the superior pelvic aponeurosis (which is lined below by the levator ani) and the lateral pelvic aponeurosis, there is found on each side of the anus a conical space, the base of which is directed downwards, and corresponds to the skin: it is formed behind by the lower border of the glutseus maximus ; in front by the transversus perinei muscle ; on the inside by the levator ani and the superior pelvic aponeurosis; and on the outside by the tuberosity of the ischium.* Each of these fossae is filled by a large quantity of fat, and traversed by fibrous laminae, some of which extend verticaUy from the apex to the base, and divide the contained adipose cellular tissue into several distinct portions. When an abscess occurs in either of these fossa3, it may be easily conceived, how difficult it is for the inner surface of its parietes to come into opposition: hence the pathology of fistulse, and the modes of cure which are adopted.

D D 4 muscles of the leg, as they are passing upon the dorsal or plantar surface of the foot; the plantar and dorsal fascia of the foot; and, lastly, the fibrous sheaths, which maintain the tendons in contact w^th the phalanges of the toes. We shall describe these in succession. The Femoral Aponeurosis, or Fascia Lata, After the remarks which we have already made upon the aponeuroses ge- nerally, it may be easily conceived that the muscles of the thigh, which are so numerous, of such great length, and so loosely united together, and almost all of ■vrhich are reflected to a greater or less amount over the knee, require to be kept ia close contact with each other and with the bones; hence the necessity for the femoral aponeurosis, consisting of a large fibrous sheath, that confines without compressing the muscles, and the strength of which is directly proportioned to the force of the muscles, and their tendency to displacement. Its super- ficial or subcutaneous surface {g h,fig. 137.) is separated from the skin by a very thin fibrous layer, the fascia superficialis (not shown in fg. 137.), which can be more easily demonstrated immediately below the femoral arch, and along the saphenous vein. Between the femoral aponeurosis or fascia lata and this superficial fascia, which results from the union of the fibrous pi'olongations given oS by the deep surface of the skin, the subcutaneous vessels and nerves tske their course, and communicat e with the deep vessels and nerves, either by simple openings or by fibrous canals, of variable length. Under this fascia also are situated the superficial lymphatic vessels, and glands of the groin. A great number of the superficial nerves of the thigh have special sheaths, wlich are hollowed out, as it were, in the substance of this aponeurosis. The femoral aponeurosis is perforated with a great number of foramina op- posite the femoral vessels, from Poupart's ligament to the entrance of the vena saphena (x) into the femoral vein (y). These foramina, which occupy a trian- gular space, of which the base is above and the apex below, are intended for the passage of a great number of lymphatic vessels, which pass through it to join the deep set. This has been called the sieve-like portion of the fascia lata, or -he fascia cribriformis (v): it has been said by some, that the aponeurosis is altogether wanting in this situation.* We not unfrequently find a lymphatic gland occupying one of the foramina. The most remarkable of all these openings is undoubtedly that (i) for the vena saphena interna, where that vessel enters the femoral vein, at the upper part of the thigh, eight or ten lines below Poupart's ligament. The margin of this opening, which has been improperly called the inferior orifice of the crural canal, can only be demonstrated in its lower half, on account of the ahnost com- plete absence of the aponeurosis above it: this is the reason of the semilunar form of the portion of the fascia over which the vein passes. The deep surface of the fascia lata gives off a great number of prolongations, which pass between the muscles, and form their proper investments or sheaths. The largest of these prolongations form two lateral septa, called the inter- muscular septa, which extend from the fascia to the linea aspera ; each has the torm of a triangle, having its base directed downwards and its apex upwards ; tliey are extremely thick, especially below.

Its anterior surface affords attachments to the vastus internus, throughout its whole extent: its posterior surface is in opposition with the adductors, and is intimately united to their aponeuroses. Its outer margin is attached to the linea aspera: its inner margin is very thick, and prominent below, where it is strengthened by the inferior tendon of the adductor magnus, and may be felt under the skin like a cord. It appears to become continuous below with the internal lateral ligament of the knee. It is composed of very strong vertical fasciculi, passing somewhat obliquely downwards and inwards. These fasciculi are bound together above the inner condyle by others passing transversely, and are crossed almost at right angles by the tendinous fibres of the adductors. Lastly, the internal septum is perforated, near the linea aspera, by a number of orifices destined for the passage of vessels, and forming communications between the anterior and the internal sheath of the muscles of the thigh. The external intermuscular septum. This serves as a septum, an aponeurosis of insertion, and as a sheath for the vastus externus. It extends from the great trochanter to the external condyle, above which it forms a projecting cord: it afiords attachments to the vastus externus ia front, and to the short head of the biceps behind. Its inner margin is attached to the linea aspera: its outer margin forms a prominent cord, especially belov. It consists of fibres directed vertically, or somewhat obliquely outwards, and strengthened by transverse fibres above the condyle. Like the interral septum it is perforated, especially above and below: above, for the passage of the circumflex vessels ; below, for the passage of the articular vessels of the knee. We shall now examine the different sheaths furnished by the femoral apo- neurosis. One of the most important of these is, as it were, hollowed out of -he sides of the others, and belongs to the femoral vessels. The Sheath of the Femoral Vessels. The femoral artery (z, fig. 137.) and vein (y) are inclosed in a prismatic and triangular tendinous canal, which protects them in their course amidst ihe muscles of the thigh. The portion of the canal (laid open m fig. 137.), included between the femoral arch and the point where the vena saphena opens into the femoral vein, has received the name of the crural canal, a term to which t have always objected, since it was first introduced into anatomical nomencla- ture because it establishes a false analogy between the inguinal canal and this upper portion of the sheath of the femoral vessels; for, while an obhque mgmnal hernia traverses the entire length of the inguinal canal, crural herniae, as far at least as my own observation extends, never protrude through the saphenous opening, but escape immediately below the femoral arch, and bit up the cribri- form portion of the fascia lata.* , ■ r j v „o The anterior wall of the sheath of the femoral vessels is formed above by the ci'br^orm portion of the femoral fascia ig;fig. 137 ), then by the tascia itself! and lastly by the posterior layer of the sheath of the sartorius, m which ^^TL^iSlVi^fr:?above by the very strong layer cohering the pectineus, below by the weaker layer investing the adductors. „. , ,:„„.• u in this country, commonly limited to tlie space (r, &. 13C.), ■« [The term ^rura rmg .s m th s ^oum y, ^^^j., y generally uncTerstood situated interna ly ^Xd by M.

Lowei down, the external wall is foiTued by the aponeurosis of the vastus internus. The Three Great Muscular Sheaths of the Femoral Aponeurosis. By means of the internal and external inter-muscular septa the muscles of the Interior region of the thigh are separated from those of the enor and internal regions; a weaker septum than the precedmg mtervenes between the muscles of the internal and posterior regions. It follows, then, that the femoral aponeurosis presents three great tendinous sheaths,-an anterior, an internal, and a posterior. . . ^ ^i, r.- „„ The great posterior sheath is undivided: it is common to the biceps, the semi-tendinosus and the semi-membrauosus. , n The great anterior and internal sheaths are subdivided into a number ot se- condary sheaths, inmost cases corresponding with the number of the muscles. The great anterior sheath. The sartorius has a proper sheath, remarkable for its prismatic and triangular form. The rectus femoris, or long head ol the triceps, is separated from the two vasti by a tendinous layer, very thin below, but strong above, and composed of vertical fibres. The tensor vaginse femoris is'contained in the strongest sheath m the human body, for it is formed by the fascia lata itself. The deep layer of this sheath is much thmner than the superficial; it commences at the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium below the rectus, and may be regarded as the deep origin of the broad band in which the tensor vaginae femoris terminates : it is composed of vertical fibres, prolonged between the rectus and the vastus ex- ternus. Lastly, above and on the outside, we find the sheath of the psoas and iliacus (s'. Jig. 136.), which forms a continuation of the lumbo-iliac aponeurosis, or fascia iliaca. The great internal sheath furnishes a number of tendinous lamellae, which separate the different muscles of this region. Thus, there is a proper sheath for the gracilis, a common one for the pectineus and the adductor longus, one for the adductor brevis, and another for the adductor magnus. The sheath of the obtm-ator extemus is continuous with that of the adductor brevis; it com- mences by a very strong fibrous lamina or arch, which arises from the ante- rior edge of the pubes, and is directed obliquely outwards to the fibrous cap- sule of the hip joint. This arch conceals the anterior orifice of the obturator canal, and protects the obturator vessels and nerves. Lastly, the two vasti, which extend into all the regions of the thigh, have sheaths formed by the femoral fascia, where they are superficial, and by the internal and external intermuscular septa, and the posterior laminte of the other sheaths, in their more deeply situated portions. In the midst of the sheaths of the anterior and internal regions, we find the sheath of the femoral vessels already described. The Superior Circumference of the Femoral Aponeurosis. In front the femoral aponeurosis arises from the femoral arch, with which it is so perfectly continuous, as to render the arch tense : hence the plan, al- ready mentioned as proposed by Scarpa, of endeavouring to remove the con- striction in cases of strangulated crural hernia, by puncturing the femoral aponeurosis. But the mode of origin and continuity of this fascia with the femoral arch is not the same on the inner and outer sides. On the outside the iliac portion of the femoral aponeurosis (g,fig. 137.) arises by a single very thick layer; more internally, in the situation of the femoral vessels, it arises by two layers, one superficial, thin and perforated by foramina (the cribriform portion, d); tlicAPONEUROLOGY. ilWn ?f ^' "flf-.

This deep layer forms the posterior wall of the canal oi the femoral vessels. On the inside of the thigh, the femoral aponeurosis arises from the body ot the OS pubis, and the ascending ramus of the ischium. On the outside and behind, it arises from the crest of the ilium by very nu- merous vertical fibres, which are strengthened, especiaUy behind, by other horizontal fibres. Between the posterior superior spine of the iUum and the crest of the sacrum, there is a tendinous arch, which is common to the femo- ral fascia and the aponeurosis of the long muscles of the back. TTie Glutaal Aponeurosis. The glutseal aponeurosis forms the upper and back part of the femoral fascia. It covers the glutseus medius, in which situation it is extremely thick, and IS continuous with the broad band of the tensor vagina} femoris. Having reached the upper border of the glutaeusmaximus, it is divided into two layers,— one superficial and very thin, which covers the outer surface of the glutseus maximus, becomes thinner below, and continuous with the femoral fascia; the other deep and thicker, especially above and behind, where it affords attach- ment to the glutseus maximus, and is blended with the great sacro-sciatic liga- ment. It becomes very thin where it separates the glutseus maximus from the deep-seated muscles. A synovial capsule intervenes between this fascia and the great trochanter, and another between it and the tuberosity of the ischium. It presents a very remarkable opening, called the glutceal arch, for the pas- sage of the glutseal vessels and nerves. Lastly, over that portion of the glutseus maximus which enters into the formation of the corresponding perineal fossa, it acquires a great degree of thickness; and, at the lower border of the muscle, is blended with the superficial layer of the glutseal fascia. The Inferior Circumference of the Femoral Aponeurosis. The femoral aponeurosis terminates below, around the knee joint, where it becomes continuous, partly with the fascia of the leg, and partly with the fibrous structures covering this articulation. Concerning the arrangement of these fibrous laminae, we shall offer a few remarks. Behind, the femoral aponeurosis passes over the popliteal space, and is con- tinuous with the fascia of the leg. In front it is prolonged over the patella, from which it is separated by a synovial bursa; it is very thin, and is continued in front of the ligament of the patella, upon which it forms a thin layer of transverse fibres. On the inside it is at first blended with the sheath of the sartorius, and then with the horizontal portion of the tendon of this muscle ; it crosses the fibres of that portion perpendicularly, and becomes continuous with the fascia of the leg. Llnder this layer of fibrous tissue we find, on the inside of the knee, another very dense layer, formed by vertical tendinous fibres derived from the vastus internus, and inserted into the upper part of the inner suiface of the tibia, beneath the tendon of the sartorius. This fibrous layer, which may be re- garded as the lower or tibial insertion of the vastus externus, occupies the in- terval between the internal lateral ligament of the knee joint and the patella. Its vertical fibres are crossed by others at right angles, extending from the internal tuberosity of the femur to the corresponding margin of the patella. Lastly, under this we find another very thin layer, belonging to the synovial capsule On the outside the femoral aponeurosis is blended with the broad band ofAPONEUROSIS OF THE LEG. 411 the tensor vagina femoris, from which it can be distinguished only by the horizontal direction of its fibres. Beneath this very thick layer we find a thin one, composed of fibres stretch- ing from the external tuberosity of the femur to the patella; and, lastly, another thm layer belonging to the synovial membrane. Structure of the Femoral Aponeurosis. It is thin behind and on the inside, thicker in front, and extremely thick on the outside of the thigh, where indeed it may be said to exceed aJl other fibrous membranes in thickness and in strength. This thickened portion is bounded in front by a line extending vertically downwards from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium. Its limits behind are no less distinctly defined: hence the name given to it of the broad band {fascia lata). This great density is owing to some very strong vertical fibres, arising from the front of the crest of the ilium. It is connected with the great force and tendency to displacement of the vastus externus. We may add, that the femoral aponeurosis is composed of horizontal fibres, sometimes regularly parallel, as in its thinnest portions, and sometimes inter- secting each other. These horizontal fibres are even seen opposite the broad band on the outer side, from which they are distinguished by their direction. There is a very beautiful preparation of this aponeurosis in the museum of the Faculty of Medicine: similar preparations should be made by those who wish to obtain a good idea of the tendinous sheaths and the shape of the muscles of the thigh. It is to be made by removing all the muscles from their sheaths by means of longitudinal incisions, and substituting for them a quantity of tow, which must be taken out when the aponeuroses are completely dried. The form of the sheaths exactly represents that of the corresponding muscles. A tolerably accurate idea of these sheaths may also be obtained by cutting across each sheath and the muscle which it contains, in a fresh subject. The circumference of the section of the portion of the sheath that becomes visible after the retraction of the muscle, will give an excellent idea of the figure of the different sheaths, which are all angular and polyhedral like the muscles, but never rounded : during health they are completely filled by the muscles, which in emaciated persons, on the contrary, do not occupy more than a half, a third, or a sixth, of the area of their sheaths. Such is the femoral fascia. Its tensor muscles consist of the tensor vaginje femoris and the glutaeus maximus, the tendon of which is received between two layers of this fascia. Aponeuroses of the Leg and Foot. Aponeurosis of the Leg. The aponeurosis of the leg forms a strong general investment for the whole leg, excepting the internal surface of the tibia, which is covered by it only at its lower part, a little above the malleoli. Its external surface is separated from the skin by the superficial vessels and nerves, several of which perforate it, either directly, or after having run for a short distance in its substance. The external saphenous vein and nerve re- ceive from it a complete sheath. Its internal surface covers all the muscles of the leg, and does not adhere to them excepting above and in front, where it gives attachment to the tibialis amicus and the extensor communis digitorum. From the internal surface there proceeds on the outer side of the leg, two principal tendinous septa, one situated between the muscles of the anterior tibial region and the peronei the other between the peronei and the muscles of the posterior region of the leg. There are therefore three principal sheaths in the leg, —an anterior nn internal, and a posterior. The latter is subdivided into two other sheaths by a•11^ APONEUROLOGY, very strong transverse lamina, becoming still stronger^below, which separates the muscles of the deep posterior layer and the posterior tibial and peroneal vessels and nerves from the superficial layer of muscles, or the triceps suralis. Lastly, some tendinous laminae, more or less complete, are interposed between the different muscles of each region. Thus a tendinous layer separates the tibialis anticus, at first from the extensor communis digitorum, and then from the extensor proprius pollicis : this layer disappears in the middle of the leg. Another very strong tendinous lamina separates the tibialis posticus from the flexor longus digitorum on the one hand, and from the flexor longus pollicis on the other. Superior circumference. If we now examine the manner in which the apo- neurosis of the leg becomes continuous with that of the thigh, we shall find that, posteriorly, the femoral fascia is prolonged directly upon the leg, in order to form the posterior part of its aponeurosis, which in this situation also receives an expansion from the tendons of the biceps, sartorius, gracilis, and semi-tendinosus, and from the broad band of the fascia of the thigh. Anteriorly the fascia of the leg is continuous with that of the thigh over the patella, and appears also to arise directly from the outer edge of the anterior tuberosity of the tibia, from the head of the fibula, and from the tendon of the biceps, which, as we have already seen, gives off an aponeurotic expansion backwards. By its lower circumference this fascia is continuous with the annular liga- ments of the ankle, which we shall presently describe. Structure. On examining the direction of the fibres and the thickness of the fascia of the leg, it is found that it is much thicker in front than on the outer side of the leg, and still more so than behind ; that, in the first situation, in the upper three fourths of its extent, it is composed of obliquely interlaced fibres, some of which descend from the spine of the tibia, and others from the anterior angular surface of the fibula; and that in the lower fourth of the anterior region of the leg, and in the whole extent of the posterior region, it is composed of circular fibres. At the point wljere the muscles of the leg become tendinous, and are re- flected over the ankle, they require very strong sheaths to keep them in con- tact with the joint; the fascia of the leg, therefore, forms opposite this part the anterior, internal, and external, annular ligaments. The Annular Ligaments of the Tarsus. The annular ligaments of the tarsus are three in number,—an anterior or dorsal, an internal, and an external. The dorsal annular ligament of the tarsus. The aponeurosis of the leg is thicker at the lower and anterior part of the leg, and binds down the corre- spondino- portion of the muscles in that region. But there is in addition to this a dorsal annular ligament of the tarsus (see fig. 128.), which arises, by a narrow but thick extremity in front of the astragalo-calcanean fossa, becomes broader as it extends inwards, and is divided into two bands. The superior band passes upwards and inwards above the internal malleolus, and is split into two layers, in such a way as to form two complete sheaths,—one internal, for the tibialis anticus ; the other external, for the extensor longus digitorum and the peroneus tertius. Between these two complete sheaths, which are senarated from the synovial capsule of the joint by a layer of cellular tissue, we find an incomplete sheath (for the annular ligament is not split into two layers in this situation), intended for the extensor proprius pollicis and the anterior tibial vessels and nerves: the internal sheath is the higher, and «;<mtpd oDoosite the lower extremity of the tibia ; the external sheath is lowei, and oiesponds to the ankle joint. The injeri^r hand, or the lower bifurcation of the annular ligament, passes forwards and inwards to the front of the tarsus, and becomes continuous with the internal P'^!'*^''.'iP""^~ ^ lower band forms a second annular ligament, which t.rnishcs to each of theTHE PLANTAR APONEUROSES. 413 three preceding muscles, upon the dorsum of the foot, a less powerful sheath than that afforded by the upper band; it keeps the tendons closely applied to the bones. „ , x. j The external and internal annular ligaments of the tarsus are two fabrous bands continuous with the fascia of the leg on the one hand, and with the plantar apo- neurosis on the other. . The internal annular ligament arises from the borders and summit ot the internal malleolus, and proceeds in a radiating manner to the inner side of the OS calcis, and the inner margin of the internal plantar aponeurosis. Beneath this sheath, which is thicker below than above, and closes in the concavity on the inner surface of the os calcis, proceed the posterior tibial vessels and nerves, and also the tendons of the tibialis posticus, the flexor longus digito- rum, and the flexor longus pollicis. For these several parts there are four very distinct sheaths : the most superficial is that for the vessels and the nerves : two sheaths, placed one over the other (see fig. 130.), and behind the internal malleolus, belong, the anterior to the tibialis posticus (n), and the posterior or more superficial to the flexor longus digitorum.(o) These two sheaths soon separate as the two tendons diverge from each other towards their insertions: as the sheath of the tibialis posticus is continued as far as the insertion of that muscle, the sheath of the flexor longus digitorum accompanies it to where it gets beneath (i. e. deeper from the surface than) the plantar fascia. The sheath of the flexor longus pollicis {p) is lower than the preceding, and ex- tends obliquely along the astragalus and os calcis, to be covered by the internal plantar fascia. The external annular ligament forms a common sheath for the two peronei, longus et brevis: it extends from the border of the external malleolus to the os calcis, and is completed on the inside by the external lateral ligaments. It is at first single, but soon becomes subdivided into two other sheaths, one of which is destined for the tendon of the peroneus brevis, and the other for that of the peroneus longus. The Aponeuroses of the Foot. These are divided into the dorsal and plantar. The Dorsal Aponeuroses of the Foot. These comprise the dorsal aponeurosis properly so called, the pedal apo- neurosis (Taponeurose pedieuse), and the dorsal interosseous aponeuroses. Dorsal aponeurosis of the foot. While the upper margin of the annular liga- ment is blended with the fascia of the leg, which appears to be inserted upon it, the anterior margin of the same ligament becomes continuous with the dorsal aponeurosis of the foot. This dorsal aponeurosis is a thin layer, which forms a general sheath for all the tendons situated upon the dorsum of the foot: it gradually disappears in front, opposite the anterior extremities of the metatarsal bones, and is attached at the sides to the borders of the foot, be- coming continuous with the plantar fascia. These tendons again are separated from the extensor brevis digitorum by another and still thinner layer, which invests that muscle: this is the pedal aponeurosis : lastly, upon the same sur- face of the foot we find the four dorsal interosseous aponeuroses, viz. one for each interosseous space. The Plantar Aponeuroses. The plantar aponeuroses or fasciae are three in number, — one middle, the other two lateral. The middle plantar aponeurosis is very strong, is attached to the inner of the posterior tubercles of the calcaneum, becomes suddenly contracted, and after- wards gradually expands without diminishing perceptibly in thickness Op- posite the anterior extremities of the metatarsal bones, it divides into fourAPONEUROLOGY. 414 bands, -which are themselves bifurcated almost immediately, so as to embrace the flexor tendons of the four outer toes. Becoming moulded on the sides of these tendons, they furnish those of each toe with an ahnost complete sheath, ■which is attached to the upper and lateral borders of the anterior glenoid liga- ment of the corresponding metatarso-phalangal articulation, and becomes con- tinuous with the tendinous sheath of the corresponding toe. These four sheaths are separated by three arched openings, through which proceed the lumbricales and interosseous muscles and the plantar vessels and nerves. There is a perfect analogy between the middle plantar and the middle palmar aponeu- rosis ; but the former is by far the stronger. It constitutes, indeed, a true ligament for the foot, offers a powerful resistance to the forced extension of the phalanges upon the bones of the metatarsus, and supports the antero-pos- terior arch of the sole of the foot. I have known exceedingly violent pain to be produced by distension, and probably laceration of some of the fibres of this aponeurosis. The margins of the middle plantar aponeurosis are curved upwards, ■ so as to embrace the flexor brevis digitorum on each side ; they become con- tinuous with the external and internal plantar aponeuroses, and form septa between the muscles of the middle and those of the external and internal plantar regions: in front these septa are complete, but only partial behind. The upper surface of this fascia gives attachment, posteriorly, to the short flexor of the toes: the proper tendinous expansion of this muscle appears to be given off from the upper surface of the plantar aponeurosis. Some transverse fibres strengthen this fascia in front, and I shall also notice some other transverse fibres, perfectly distinct from the preceding, which form a true transverse ligament for the four outer toes : it is situated opposite the middle of the lower surface of the first phalanges, and is admirably adapted for opposing their dislocation. The external and internal plantar aponeuroses. The external plantar apo- neurosis, very thick behind and thin in front, gives attachment by its upper surface to the abductor muscle of the little toe, and is bifurcated at the posterior extremity of the fifth metatarsal bone. The external division of this bifur- cation is very strong, is inserted into the enlarged posterior extremity of the fifth metatarsal bone, and may be regarded as a powerful medium of connec- tion between that bone and the cuboid. The internal plantar aponeurosis is thin in comparison with the external; it commences behind. by an arch, ex- tending from the inner malleolus to the os calcis ; its inner margin is attached to the corresponding border of the tarsus, and is continuous with the dorsal annular ligament and with the dorsal fascia of the foot; its outer margin is blended with the middle plantar fascia, or rather is reflected upwards, to com- plete the sheath for the internal muscles of the foot. These three plantar fasciae just described form three sheaths, which are quite distinct in their anterior five sixths, but communicate with each other behind. The internal plantar sheath includes the abductor and the short flexor* of the great toe, which are separated from each other by a layer of fibrous tissue ; it also contains the internal plantar artery and nerves. The external plantar sheath includes the abductor and the flexor of the little toe, which are also separated by a tendinous layer. Lastly, the middle plantar sheath includes the short flexor of the toes, the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, the flexor accessorius, the lumbricales, the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis, the oblique adductor f, the transversus pedis, and the external plantar vessels and nerves. The sheath of the flexor brevis digi- torum is completed above by an aponeurotic layer, which separates it from the tendons of the long flexor and from the accessorius. A proper sheath exists tor the oblique adductor f, and a subdivision of the same sheath for the transverse * r/. e.

Lastly, the inferior interosseous aponeurosis is remarkable for its thickness, and for the septa which it gives off between the interosseous muscles The sheaths into which the flexor tendons of the toes are received opposite the phalanges, resemble so exactly those of the fingers, that I shall not an- ticipate what will be said hereafter regarding the latter. We find the same system of synovial membranes, and the same loose, membranous, and exten- sible cellular tissue for the flexor tendons of the toes, as for those of the fingers. In all sheaths that are partly osseous and partly tendinous, we find a synovial membrane * ; but, on the other hand, there is nothing more than a loose cel- lular tissue in situations where a tendon or muscle glides in the interior of a confining aponeurosis. The Aponeuroses of the Upper ExTREsnTT. These comprise the aponeuroses of the shoulder ; the brachial aponeurosis ; the aponeurosis of the fore-arm; the dorsal and anterior annular ligaments of the carpus ; the palmar aponeurosis ; and, lastly, the sheaths for the tendons of the flexor muscles of the fingers. The Aponeuroses of the Shoulder. These are the supraspinous, the infra-spinous, the sub-scapular, and the del- toid aponeuroses. The supraspinous aponeurosis is a thick layer of fibrous tissue, attached to the entire circumference of the supra-spinous fossa, and converting it into a sort of osteo-fibrous case, that serves as a sheath for the supra-spinatus muscle, to which it also afibrds several points of attachment. This tendinous layer is gradually lost, externally, under the acromio-coracoid arch. The infra-spinous aponeurosis is an equally dense and strong fibrous lamina, attached to the entire margin of the infra-spinous fossa, and completing the osteo-fibrous sheath of the infra-spinatus muscle: it is continuous on the out- side with the brachial fascia, and gives off from its anterior surface a thick septum intervening between the scapular attachments of the teres major and those of the teres minor, and also some thinner septa interposed between the teres minor and the infra-spinatus, and between the different portions of the infra-spinatus muscle itself. The deltoid aponeurosis. The infra-spinous aponeurosis having reached the posterior border of the deltoid muscle, splits into two layers : of these, the superficial layer invests the deltoid, and terminates in the brachial aponeurosis; the deep layer continues to cover the tendon of the infra-spinatus, and becomes attached to the tendon of the short head of the biceps. Some very loose cel- lular tissue, or even a synovial bursa, separates this aponeurosis from the head of the humerus, and the tendons inserted around it. The sub-scapular aponeurosis is a very thin membrane, which completes the sheath of the sub-scapularis, and gives the muscle some points of attachment It is fixed to the entire margin of the sub-scapular fossa. T7ie Brachial Aponeurosis. The brachial aponeurosis commences above at the clavicle, the acromion, and the spine of the scapula, and is continuous with the infi-a-spinous aponeurosis: on the inner side it arises from the tendons of the pectoralis major and the latissiinus dorsi; and, in the interval between them, from the cellular tissue of the axilla: it envelops the arm as far down as the elbow, where it becomes con- tinuous with the fascia of the fore-arm, and is attached to the different bony pro jections presented by the surface of that joint. Its superficial surface is separ- • Sec note on Aponeukology, p. 389.■^'^ APONEUROLOGY. ated from the skin by vessels and nerves, to which it furnishes sheaths of greater or less extent. We may admit the existence of a superficial fascia between the vessels and the skin. Its deep surface presents various septa dividing its interior into a certain number of thin sheaths for the several muscles. It is composed almost en- tirely of circular fibres, some of which have a somewhat spiral direction • these fibres are intersected at right angles by others passing vertically downwards to the fascia of the fore-arm. The brachial aponeurosis is so loose as to permit the free exercise of the muscles contained within it, yet sufficiently tense to prevent their displacement. It is slightly thickened on either side, along the outer and inner borders of the humerus, and gives off in those situations two very strong intermuscular septa,—one external, the other internal. These septa are in every respect ana- logous to those of the femoral fascia, and divide the brachial sheath into two great compartments,—an anterior, containing the muscles on the anterior aspect of the arm, viz. the biceps, the brachialis anticus, and the coraco-brachialis, also the upper or brachial portion of the supinator longus, and the extensor carpi radialis longior ; the posterior compartment belongs to the triceps. The external intermnscular septum arises from the anterior border of the bi- cipital groove, by a narrow and very thick extremity, blended with the poste- rior margin of the tendon of the deltoid: it reaches the outer border of the humerus, expands and becomes somewhat thinner, and separates the anterior from the posterior muscles, more especially the triceps from the brachialis an- ticus, affording atttachments to them both. It is perforated very obliquely by the musculo-spiral or radial nerve, and the superior profunda artery, which at first lie behind, but are afterwards in front of it. The sheath of this nerve and artery establish a free communication between the interior and posterior com- partments already alluded to. ^ The internal intermuscular septum, broader and thicker than the preceding, but like it of a triangular form, arises from the posterior border of the bicipital groove, below the teres major, is continuous with the tendon of the coraco- brachialis, crossing it at a very acute angle, and becoming partially united to and blended with it, proceeds along and adheres closely to the inner border of the humerus, and terminates at the inner condyle or epitrochlea of that bone. Both of these septa are formed by bands and fibres given off in succession from the corresponding borders of the humerus, and they both afford attach- ments to the brachialis anticus in front, and to the triceps behind. The ulnar nerve is anterior to the internal septum in the upper part of the arm, but perfor- ates it, and remains in contact with its posterior surface, passing between the attachments of the triceps. From these two great sheaths the proper sheaths of the muscles proceed. First, the deltoid has its proper sheath: another thin aponeurotic layer, gra- dually becoming thicker from above downwards, consisting almost entirely of vertical fibres, and forming one of the origins of the aponeurosis of the fore-arm, separates the biceps from the brachialis anticus : again, the brachial vessels and the median nerve have a special sheath, which also receives at its upper part the basilic vein, and the ulnar and internal cutaneous nerves ; this is the brachial canal, the counterpart of the femoral canal; it establishes a communi- cation between the cellular tissue of the axilla, and that in the bend of the elbow : lastly, a tendinous layer separates the upper half of the long head of the triceps from the other portions of that muscle : the sheath of the coraco- brachialis is given off from the inner edge of the biceps. We must consider as dependences of the common brachial investment, the several sheaths furnished by it to the cephalic, basilic, and median veins, to the branches of the internal cutaneous nerve, and to the superficial ramifica- tions of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. AVlien an artery or a vein previously situated under an aponeurosis becomes subcutaneous, the perforation in the aponeurosis is almost always of an arched form. The brachial aponeurosis has no muscle analogous to the tensor vagina;THE APONEUROSIS OF THE FORE-ARM. 417 femoris; the pectoralis major, and the latissimus dorsi, are sufficient to effect its tension. The Aponeurosis of the Fore-arm and Hand. The Aponeurosis of the Fore-arm. Dissection. Make a circular incision through the skin, immediately above the elbow, and from this let two vertical incisions be carried downwards to the wrist, one in front and the other behind ; let the incisions extend through to the fascia without dividing it: then cautiously remove the skin, being careful to take with it the subcutaneous adipose tissue ; the superficial veins and nerves may be preserved. The external surface of the fascia may be studied first, and its several sheaths afterwards opened in succession. The aponeurosis or fascia of the fore-arm forms a general sheath, entirely surrrounding or embracing that portion of the upper extremity, with the excep- tion of the posterior border of the ulna. It is semi-transparent, and hence can be seen to be traversed by white lines, generally vertical in their direction, which indicate a corresponding number of thickenings of the sheath, and intermus- cular septa given ofi' from them. It is separated from the skin by the superficial veins and nerves; by its upper part it gives numerous attachments to the subjacent muscles, and this renders the dissection very difiicult. By making a vertical incision, however, along the separate sheath which it furnishes to each of the muscles, and then carefully removing the latter, a good idea may be formed of the numerous angular compartments into which the common cavity of the fascia is sub- divided. In the first place, it will be seen that this fascia, like all other mvestmg aponeuroses, is composed of proper and superadded fibres- that the proper fibres are nearly or quite circular, are more or less oblique and more or less interlaced, but the superadded fibres are vertical. It will be found that it is twice as thick upon the dorsal as upon the palmar surface of the fore-arm; that its thickness and its strength increase from above down- wards ; and that it is strengthened by a great number of superadded fasciculi consisting of aponeurotic expansions from the tendons of the adjacent muscles' Ihus the brachiahs anticus on the outside, the biceps on the inside and in front and the triceps behind, give off tendinous expansions to this aponeurosis • of these the most remarkable is, without doubt, that given off from the biceps tiSLr' Tv'^ ?s the tensor of the anterior portion^of Iwn^ ^.1, expansion constitutes, in fact, one of the terminations of the biceps with the external fasciculi of which it is continuous, and moreover arises from the outer edge and the anterior surface of its tendon.

This fossa is lined by aponeui'otic lamina;; on the outside by the layer which covers the inner surface of the supinator longus, the radial extensors, and the flexor sublimis; on the inside by the layer which completes the sheath of the pronator teres : it com- municates above with the canal of the brachial artery, and below with the canals through which the radial, ulnar, and interosseous arteries and the median nerve proceed downwards to the fore-arm. From the internal surface of this fascia a number of laminae are given off, to form the following muscular sheaths : — In the anterior region of the fore-arm a transverse septum, thicker below than above, divides the superficial layer of muscles from the middle layer, consisting of the flexor sublimis, and also from the deep layer, composed of the flexor profundus digitorum and the flexor longus poUicis. Other septa, passing from before backwards, divide the muscles of the superficial layer from each other. Lower down the sheaths of the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus, which are perfectly distinct from each other, are situated in front of the remainder of the fascia; and this has led to the statement of some anatomists, that the fascia is perforated by the tendons of these muscles, especially by that of the palmaris longus. The radial artery has a special sheath throughout its whole extent, the ulnar artery and nerve have a proper sheath only in the lower part of the fore-arm. In the posterior region of the fore-arm, the fascia is much stronger than in the anterior. A transverse layer separates the muscles of the superficial from those of the deep layer ; and septa, passing from behind forwards, subdivide these common sheaths into several smaller ones, corresponding in number to that of the muscles. Thus we find a sheath for the extensor communis digi- torum, a second for the extensor digiti minuni, a third for the extensor carpi ulnaris, and a fourth for the anconeus. The supinator longus and the two radial extensors of the wrist appear to be in the same sheath: but a more or less distinct membrane surrounds the first of these muscles : the supinator brevis has also a proper sheath. We find a common sheath for the extensor longus pollicis and the extensor proprius indicis. The abductor longus and the extensor brevis pollicis, which, properly speaking, constitute but one muscle, have also a common sheath accompanying them as far as the dorsal annular ligament of the wrist. The Dorsal Annular Ligament of the Wrist, and the Dorsal Aponeurosis of the Metacarpus. The dorsal annular ligament of the wrist {r,fig. 121.) may be considered as a dependence of the fascia of the fore-arm, which in this situation is strength- ened by a great number of fibres. It is a band of six or eight lines in width, passing obliquely inwards and downwards over the extensor tendons of the hand perforated by a number of openings for the passage of vessels, and dis- tinguishable from the fascia of the fore-arm only by its somewhat greater thick- ness and by the paraUel arrangement of its fasciculi. It arises mternally fi'om the pisiform bone and the palmar fascia, passes first over the ulnar side, and then the posterior surface of the carpus, is interrupted by the outer margin ot the eroove for the two radial extensor muscles, takes a fresh origin from that marein, covers the radial side of the wrist, and is inserted partly into the radius and partly into the fascia of the fore-arm. From the anterior surface of this thick fibrous band arise several small prolongations, which are inter- nosed between the numerous tendons passing over the dorsal and radial aspects of the carpus, and convert the grooves upon the lower extremities of the radius and ulna into canals. Thus proceeding from without inwards, and from befo e backwards, we find, 1. a sheath for the united tendons of the abductor longusANTERIOR ANNULAR LIGAMENT OF THE CARPUS. 419 and extensor brevis pollicis; 2. and 3. two distinct sheaths opposite the radius,— one for the two radial extensors of the carpus, the other for the extensor longus pollicis, which sheaths become blended together lower down into a single completely fibrous sbeath ; 4. a fourth sheath, stronger than the prece- ding, for the extensor communis digitorum and the extensor proprius indicia; 5. an entirely fibrous sheath for the extensor digiti minimi; 6. a very strong sheath for the extensor carpi ulnaris, which is prolonged below the ulna, and accompanies the tendon as far as the fifth metacarpal bone. All these sheaths are lined by synovial membranes*, which extend some distance above the dorsal annular ligament, and, on the other hand, accompany the tendons very far down, sometimes even to their insertions. The dorsal aponeurosis of the metacarpus is a continuation of the dorsal an- nular ligament: it is composed of a very thin layer of transverse fibres, and separates the extensor tendons from the subcutaneous vessels and nerves. A very loose, extensible, and elastic cellular tissue takes the place of the synovial membranes over these tendons, and greatly facilitates their movements. The Anterior Annular Ligament of the Carpus. The deep groove upon the anterior surface of the carpus is converted into a canal by a very thick fibrous band, viz. the anterior ligament of the carpus (.9'fig- 118.). It commences internally by two well marked origins, separated from each other by the ulnar nerve, one being from the pisiform bone and the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, the other from the unciform bone. The first bundle passes downwards, the second transversely, and their united fibres some of which are transverse and others interlaced, terminate at the trapeziuru and the scaphoid, giving off an expansion to the fascia covering the ball of the thumb, with which they are continuous. This ligament is continuous above with the fascia of the fore-arm, which is much thickened in this situation: it receives, in front, the expanded tendon of the palmaris longus, and terminates below in the palmar fascia. Its anterior surface gives attachment to most of the muscles of the thenar and hypothenar eminences. A small portion only of this ligament is generally seen and described, viz. the free portion. If it is wished to obtain a perfect conception of it, the muscles attached to its' anterior surface should be carefully removed; it will then be seen, that on the outside It describes a curve having its concavity directed inwards, in order to be at- tached to the scaphoid and the trapezium, and that the sheath of the flexor carpi radiaUs is contained in its substance: this sheath is entirely fibrous above and partly fibrous and partly osseous below, where it converts into a canal the' groove on the trapezium. While there are almost as many synovial membranes as there are sheaths under the dorsal hgaments of the carpus, on the palmar aspect nine tendons with the median nerve form but a single bundle, which is lubricated by one or two synovial membranes. This synovial membrane* presents a curious ar- rangement, subject moreover to numerous varieties. It lines the posterior sur- face of the anterior annular ligament of the carpus, is prolonged above and below that hgament, and is reflected (without passing between the different ten- dons) upon the anterior surface of the bundle formed by them and by the median t^Zt ^ i° """^'^ t° ^'^'^urate idea of the m^nf'^T^^ membrane, cut across the tendons at the lower will "^,1 ^'"l*''™ "P«° the palm of the hand: it bordor'?t,^f K^^f '^''"^"^l membrane is reflected upon the ulnar Sn^more^^^^ "^^^ ^^^^ Posterior surface of this bmidle. passing more or less between the tendons, and separating them from each other ^rnln.

Nor is this all, for there is a special synovial membrane for the flexor longus pollicis. In order to expose this, the synovial membrane must be cut through where it is reflected, on its radial side, from the annular ligament on to the median nerve and the anterior surface of the bundle of ten- dons : a special and very extensive synovial membrane will then be seen to pass high up along the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis, and to be pro- longed downwards as far as the last phalanx of the thumb. The Palmar Aponeurosis. The palviar fascia ic,fig. 118.) forms a common sheath for all the muscles of the palm of the hand, and is divided into three portions,—a middle and two lateral. The middle portion. This is the only part generally described as the palmar fascia; it is triangular and strong, but of variable thickness : it binds down the numerous subjacent tendons. It arises from the anterior surface and lower margin of the anterior annular ligament of the carpus, and from the tendon of the palmaris longus, which may be regarded as its tensor muscle. Between these two origins the ulnar artery penetrates into the palm of the hand. Not unfrequently the expanded tendon of the palmaris longus forms a fibrous layer in front of the proper palmar fascia. This fascia is narrow and thick at its origin, but expands as it proceeds from above downwards, and, opposite the heads of the metacarpal bones, divides into eight prolongations for the four inner fingers. At the seat of this division we find very strong transverse fibres binding the prolongations together, and preventing disjunction of the fingers, and laceration of the fascia. By this arrangement four arches are formed, under which the tendons of the flexor muscles pass: between these four arches there are three smaller ones, giving passage to the collateral vessels and nerves of the fingers, and to the lumbricales, so that altogether there are seven arches. These arches are true fibrous canals. In order perfectly to understand their structure, make a vertical incision through the palmar fascia ; it will then be seen, that, opposite the arches, tendinous prolongations or tongues are detached from the deep surface of the fascia: these prolongations turn round the sides of the tendons so as to embrace them, and become continuous with the anterior or glenoid ligament of the metacarpo-phalangal articula- tions : the same arrangement obtains with regard to the three small arches for the vessels and nerves situated between the four principal tendinous arches. The palmar fascia is, moreover, intimately united to the skin by very nume- rous prolongations : its deep surface covers the superficial palmar arch of the arteries of the hand, the median and ulnar nei'ves, and the flexor tendons ; a very loose and extensible cellular tissue separates it from these parts, and facilitates the movements of the tendons. From its inner margin is given off a very strong layer, which becomes continuous with the interosseous aponeurosis, and separates the middle from the internal palmar region; a thinner layer proceeds from its outer margin, and passes down between the muscles of the thenar eminence and the first lumbricalis muscle. This small muscle, called the palmaris hrevis (b, fig. 118.), arises from the inner margin of the middle palmar fascia, and is merely a cutaneous muscle. The external and internal palmar fasciw, or the thenar and hypothenar apo- neuroses These consist of two rather thin fibrous layers, forming the sheaths of the muscles of the ball of the thumb and those of the little finger : they are both continuous with the middle palmar fascia: the external appears to con- sist in a great measure, of an expansion from the tendon of the abductor longus pollicis ; Ind the internal, of an expansion from that of the flexor carpi ulnans. At the limits between these aponeuroses and the middle fascia are formed two septa, passing from before backwards, and dividing the palm of the hand into three distinct sheaths,-one median, completed by the interosseous aponeurosis,SHEATHS OF THE FJ.EXOR TENDONS. 421 E ! S and intended for all the flexor tendons and the principal vessels and nerves of the hand; the other two placed on either side, and binding down the muscles of the thenar and hypothenar eminences. The Sheaths of the Flexor Tendons of the Fingers, and their Synovial Membranes. After leaving the arches, or rather the curious sheaths, formed by the pal- mar fascia immediately above the corresponding metacarpo-phalangal articula- tion, each pair of flexor tendons is received into a special sheath, by which they are accompanied down to the last phalanx. It will be remembered that the anterior surfaces of the first and second phalanges are marked by a longi- tudinal groove ; to the two borders of this groove is attached a very regular semi-canal of fibrous tissue, which is exactly large enough to contain the two flexor tendons. This very strong sheath preserves its shape when the tendons have been removed; and a correct idea of its importance may be obtained, by observing the effects of contraction of the flexor muscles after it has been di- vided. This sheath is formed of parallel semicircular laminae, placed one above the other, densely aggregated over the bodies of the phalanges, and for the most part forming a continuous sheath, but becoming more and more se- parated, and sometimes even completely disappearing opposite the articulations and the articulating extremities of the bones. It appears to me, that, in the movements of flexion, these articular rings are pushed into each other. The sheath ceases altogether above the articulation of the second with the terminal phalanx. A very remarkable synovial membrane *, which is prolonged upwards be- yond the arches formed by the palmar fascia, lines the whole length of each osteo-fibrous sheath on the one hand, and on the other is reflected upon the two flexor tendons, afibrding each of them a sheath, and forms two, often three or four triangular folds, having their bases directed upwards, and being per- fectly analogous to the so-called adipose ligament of the knee joint. Of these folds, the superior is situated opposite the upper extremity of the first phalanx, and extends from the tendon of the flexor sublimis to that of the flexor pro- fundus ; the inferior fold passes from the bifurcation of the superficial tendon to the deep tendon; the others are intermediate, and proceed from the phalanx to the two tendons. These synovial folds can be very well seen, by raising and separating the flexor tendons from the phalanges. Not unfrequently the synovial membrane forms a hernia between two of these tendinous rings, either opposite the body of a phalanx, or still more commonly over one of the articu- lations. We may add, that these synovial folds are probably intended to sup- port the nutritious vessels of the tendons, and not to connect these tendons together. * See note, p. 389.422 SPLANCHNOLOGY. General observations on the viscera.—External conformation.— Structure.— Developement.—Functions Dissection. Splanchnology, (from (nr\dyx''ov, viscus) is that division of anatomy which treats of organs more or less compound in their structure. Some of these are contained within the three great visceral cavities (the viscera), whilst others are situated without these cavities (organs, properly so called). * The brain, the spinal cord, the heart, and the organs of the senses, are ge- nerally included in this division. I have thought it advisable, however, to confine myself here to the description of the digestive, respiratory, and genito- urinary apparatus. The organs of the senses, the brain, and the spinal cord, will be studied more advantageously in connection with the rest of the nervous system, and the heart with the other organs of the circulation. As the organs we are about to examine have few relations with each other, they do not admit of such extended and important general remarks as those which preceded the osteological and myological divisions. I shall content myself with explaining briefly the method in which the description of each organ should be pursued. Every organ presents for consideration its external conformation, its in- ternal conformation or its structure, its developement, and its functions. The External Conformation of Organs. The description of the external conformation of organs includes that of their nomenclature, number, situation, direction, size, shape, and relations. Nomenclature. The nomenclature of organs has not been subjected to so many changes as that of the bones and muscles ; the names adopted by the oldest authors have been retained in modern science, and are even used in common language. The names of organs are derived, 1. from their uses, as the asophagus (from olio, I convey, and (payw, I eat); also, the lachrymal and the salivary glands: 2. from their length, as the duodenum: 3. from their direction, as the rectum -. 4, from their shape, as the amygdala (the tonsils): 5. from their structure, as the ovaries: 6. from the name of the authors who have best described them, as the Schneiderian membrane, the Fallopian tubes: lastly, they are conventional words, for example, the tongue, the liver. Sec. Nuviber. Some organs are single ; others exist in pairs. Varieties in number are very common, both by excess and by defect. Thus three kidneys have been found in the same individual, and there is often only one. Ex- amples have been recorded of individuals having three testicles; one is un- common. Lastly, varieties by excess almost always result from the division, and those by defect from the union or fusion, of organs. Situation. This must be considered with regard to the region of the body occupied by an organ, i. e. its general or absolute situation; and also with re- gard to its relations with neighbouring organs, i. e. its relative situation. Thus, when it is stated that the stomach occupies the left hypochondi-ium and the epigastrium, its absolute or general situation is indicated ; but when it is added that this viseus is situated between the oesophagus and duodenum, below the diaphragm, and above the transverse mesocolon, its relative situation is implied. . . ... , , . Many of the organs are subject to varieties of position ; and this constitutes * AH the viscera are organs, but all the organs are not viscera. The word viscus is probably derived from vescor, I eatj because a great number of the viscera are engaged m the tunctions of nutrition.423 E E 4 INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF ORGANS. au important point in tteir history. These varieties of position depend upon con-enital or upon accidental displacement, either affecting the particular orsan only, or consequent upon displacement of the neighhourmg organs ; or they may result from a change in the size of the organ itself. Size. The absolute size of an organ is determined by linear measurements, by the quantity of water which it displaces, and by its weight; its relative size, by comparison with bodies of a known size, or with other organs. The size of organs is subject to a great number of varieties. These depend either on age, as in the liver, testicles, and thijmus gland; on sex, temperament, or on individual peculiarities; also on the state in which an organ is found,—tor example the uterus, penis, and spleen. Lastly, there are some pathological variations, which should not be omitted in a treatise upon descriptive anatomy. Figure. The figure of the organs treated of in splanchnology appears to follow these rules. The double organs do not exactly resemble each other on the right and left sides of the body. The single organs, occupying the median line, are symmetrical; but most of those which are removed from that line are not symmetrical. Nevertheless, symmetry is not so completely wanting in the viscera belonging to nutritive life, as stated by Bichat, for the stomach and the small and great intestines may be divided into two equal halves. In regard to their forms, organs are compared in general either with familiar objects, or with geometric figures. Thus a kidnei/ is said to resemble a kidney- bean, and either lung, a cone. In very irregular organs, we merely describe the sm-faces and the borders. We shall not find in the viscera the same con- stancy of form as exists in the organs of relation. Direction. The direction of an organ is determined in the same manner as that of the bones and muscles, viz. by its relations with the imaginary planes surrounding the body, or with the mesial plane. Relations. The figure of an organ being determined, its surface is then divided into regions, the relations of which are accurately ascertained. These regions are generally termed surfaces and borders. As the situation of many organs is subject to great varieties, their relations must also vary. Too much cannot be said of the value of an accurate knowledge of these relations, from which a number of the most important practical inferences may be derived. The Internal Conformation or Structure of Organs, The surface of an organ being well understood, we next proceed to the study of its structure, comprising its colour, its consistence, and its anatomical elements. Colour. The colour both of the surface and the substance of an organ require to be studied. All variations of colour should be very carefully noted. Age and disease have much influence over it; and it is often difficult to dis- tinguish positively between its physiological and pathological condition. Consistence. The consistence, density, and fragility of organs are connected with their structure. The specific gravity or density of a single organ only, the lung, has been accurately studied, and that in a medico-legal point of view. In estimating the consistence and fragility of organs we can only approximate the truth. It is desirable that some more methodical and accurate means should be devised for the estimation of these qualities. Anatomical elements. The determination of the immediate anatomical ele- ments, or tissues, which enter into the composition of an organ, together with their proportions and their arrangement, constitutes the knowledge of its structure. Every organ has either a cellular, fibrous, cartilaginous, or bony framework. Some organs are provided with muscular fibres, or even with distinct muscles; they all contain the several kinds of vessels, viz. arteries, veins, and lymphatics; and they all possess nerves. The glandular organs have ex- cretory ducts. In explaining the structure of organs, we shall generally confine ourseh-esSPLANCHNOLOGY. !na! ^'"ief enumeration of their constituent parts, referring to works on tl„ anatomy of textures for details which would'be misplaced^in^refemrntlr; The Developement of Organs. The study of the developement of organs, and the changes which thpv nndergo at the different periods of intra- and extra-uterine^ life! is of the greatest interest, at east as regards some among them. The formation of he soft parts however, is not nearly so well understood as that of the hard tis ues because the most important phenomena of developement occur during the fim weeks after conception. The remarks upon this subject wiU therefore gene rally point out some hiatus to be filled up. ^ The Functions of Organs. The functions or uses of organs flow so naturaUy from their anatomical description, that we shall follow the example of the greaterTuLerTana tomists, m adding to such description, a short account of the fiinctions of an organ We shall only notice particularly those uses of organs which depend immediately upon their structure, referring to physiological works for^the details and discussions of yet disputed points in the science of functions No part of anatomy excites so much curiosity and interest as splanchnology in consequence of the importance of the organs of which it treats. Without a knowledge of this department of anatomy, it is impossible to understand the mechanism of functions the most indispensable to life ; and as the organs them- selves are the seat of the greater part of the lesions which are assimed to the physician as weU as of many of those which fall under the care of the surgeon most of the fundamental questions of the healing art require a profound luiow- ledge of these organs. Tlie Dissection of the Viscera. The dissection of organs does not consist in merely isolating them from sur- rounding parts, which, as far as regards those contained in the visceral cavities IS done by simply laying open the latter, but in the separation of their ana- tomical elements or tissues. For this purpose injections of the most delicate kind, maceration, boiling, preservation in alcohol, desiccation, the action of acids, m short, all the resources of his art, are employed by the anatomist. Having made these preliminary observations, we shall now describe in suc- cession the organs of digestion, the organs of respiration, and the genito- urinary apparatus. THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION AND THEIR APPENDAGES. ALIMENTARY OR DIGESTIVE CANAL. General observations.—Division.—Mouth and its appendages. Lips. Cheeks. Hard and soft palate. — Tonsils.—Tongue. — Salivary glands. —Buccal mucous membrane — Pharynx. — (Esophagus. — Stomach. —Small intestine. —Large intestine. —Muscles of the perineum—Developement of the intestinal canal. Thk organs of digestion form a long canal, the alimentary or digestive canal, extending from the mouth to the anus, which receives alimentary substances, induces in them a series of changes, by which they are rendered fit to repair the losses incurred by the body, and moreover presents a vast absorbent surface for the action of the lacteal vessels. The entire series of these organs consti- tutes the digestive apparatus. The existence of an alimentary canal is one of the essential characters of an425 GENERAL REMARKS. animal. In consequence of possessing it, animals may be detached from the soil, so as to move from place to place. In the lowest species, the entire animal is nothing more than an alimentary sac, having a single opening, and formed by a reflection of the skin ; so that, according to the beautiful observation of Trembley, when polypes are turned inside out, the digestive process is per- formed as well by their external as by their internal surface. Ascending in the scale of animals, the canal soon presents two openings, acquires larger di- mensions, becomes more or less convoluted, and is distinct from other sys- tems of organs. A skeleton clothed by muscles is interposed between it and the skin. It becomes more and more voluminous, in proportion as the nutritive materials and the textures of the body differ more widely in their chemical composition. What a difference there is, in this respect, between certain fishes, in which the alimentary canal is not nearly so long as the animal, and some herbivora; the ram for example, in which it is twenly-seven times the length of the body. Carnivorous animals, again, have a short and narrow alimentary canal. Man being destined to live, both upon animal and vegetable substances, occupies, as it were, a middle station between the hei'bivora and carnivora. General situation. The digestive canal is situated in front of the vertebral column, with the direction of which the straight portion of the canal accurately corresponds, whilst its tortuous part is distant from, though invariably con- nected with it by means of membranous attachments. It commences at the lower part of the face, traverses the neck and the thorax, penetrates into the ab- dominal cavity, which is almost exclusively intended for it, and the dimensions and mechanism of which bear strict relation to the functions of the alimentary canal; and it terminates at the outlet of the pelvis, anterior to the coccyx, by the anal oi'ifice. Its upper part is in immediate relation with the organs of respiration ; its lower, with the genito-urinary apparatus. Dimensions. The length of the digestive canal has been calculated to be seven or eight times that of the body of the individual. Its diameter is not equal through its whole extent; and its alternate expansions and contractions establish very distinct limits between its several portions. The largest portion is undoubtedly that which receives the name of the stomach; the narrowest parts are the cervical portion of the oesophagus, the pyloric opening of the stomach, and the ileo-caecal orifice. It is important to remark, that the trans- verse diniensions of an alimentary canal have to a certain extent an inverse ratio, to its length. Thus a very wide intestinal canal is generally less re- markable for length. This remark is illustrated by comparative anatomy in the fact, that in the horse, an herbivorous animal, the intestinal canal is shorter, but at the same time of a much greater caliber than in the ruminantia, which are also herbivorous. Direction. The upper or supra-diaphragmatic portion of the alimentary canal, through which the food merely passes, is straight; the sub-diaphrag- matic portion is very much convoluted upon itself, but again becomes straight before its termination. General form. The digestive apparatus forms a cyUndrical continuous canal, m which we have to consider an external and generally free serous surface, and an internal mucous surface. Structure. The digestive canal is composed of four membranes or tunics: — 1. The most external is the serous or peritoneal coat, also named the common tunic, because it is common to almost all the organs in the abdominal cavity. Ihis membrane, which may be regarded as an accessory tunic, is often incom- plete, and even entirely wanting throughout the supra-diaphragmatic portion ot the digestive canal. At the same time that it constitutes the external covering of this canal, it separates it from the neighbouring parts, facilitates Its movements, and forms certain bands, which maintain the several portions ot the canal more or less fixedly in their proper situations. The sei-ous membranes of which this external tunic is only a dependence, are shut sacs which, on the one hand, line the walls of the cavities to which they belong'SPLANCHNOLOGY. 426 and, on the other, are reflected upon the organs contained therein *, without, however, including them within their own proper cavity. A serous membrane may be compared to a balloon, or rather to a double night-cap; its internal surface is free, smooth, always moistened with serosity, and its parietal and visceral portions are in contact with each other : its ex- ternal surface is adherent.f 2. Beneath the serous coat is situated the muscular coat, consisting of two layers,—one superficial, composed of longitudinal fibres ; the other deep and composed of circular fibres. These fibres are colourless, like almost all the muscles of nutritive or organic life.f 3. The fibrous coat, interposed between the muscular and mucous coats, may be regarded as constituting the framework of the alimentary canal. It con- sists of dense areolar cellular tissue.§ 4. The mucous coat or membrane forms the internal lining of the digestive canal. Every cavity having a communication with the exterior is lined by a mucous membrane, so called on account of the mucus with which it is constantly lubricated. In mucous membranes generally, we find, 1. a dermis or chorion. 2. Papillce or villosities, which give them a velvety appearance; hence the designation papillary, villous, or velvety membrane frequently given to them. 3. On the outer surface of the dermis we find a very dense network of capillary vessels, which may be completely injected from the veins, but less easily and less completely from the arteries. 4. Either follicles or small closed sacs are seen here and there in the substance of mucous membranes ; but they are not essen- tial, as the name follicular, given to these membranes by Chaussier and some other anatomists, would seem to indicate. All mucous membranes are covered by an extremely delicate pellicle, which may be readily detected by means of a simple lens. Injections made by the arteries and veins never penetrate it, nor is it reddened by inflammation. I * [Hence the terms parietal and visceral, applied to these two portions of a serous membrane (,seejig. of the testis, letters p and v). In consequence of the existence of an aperture in the free extremity of each Fallopian tube, the peritoneal cavity in the female is an exception to the general rule, that serous membranes form shut sacs, not communicating with the external medium.] t [Serous membranes are transparent, colourless, extremely thin, and highly distensible and elastic. They are composed of a basis of cellular tissue, loose and connected to the adjacent tissues externally, more or less condensed towards the inner and free surface of the membrane, and covered with an extra-vascular epithelium, consisting of a single layer of nucleated cells, flattened into the form of scales, and arranged parallel to that surface. Cilia have been detected on many serous membranes, as on the peritoneum and pericardium of the frog; on the same parts, and also on the pleura and lining membrane of the ventricles of the brain in certain mammalia; and in the latter situation in man. Bloodvessels ramify in the subserous cellular tissue, but do not penetrate far towards the free surface, where they are entirely wanting. Lymphatics also exist in the subserous tissues, but have not been found in the membranes thera- seVes ; nor have nerves been traced into them. The fluid secretion found in serous cavities appears to be of an albuminous nature.] , ■„ t.t t, i n I [The involuntary muscular fibres of the alimentary canal (accordmg to Dr. W. Baly) consist of bands, varying from ^^th to j^th of an inch in diameter, apparently formed of flattened tubes in the parietes of which are seen, at irregular intervals, numerous transparent oval or linear bodies sometimes very diflicult of detection : they are believed to be the nuclei of the primitive cells, from which the fibre itself is developed. These fibres contain no varicose fila- ments nor do thev present any transverse stris, like those of animal life (see p. 249.). More- over although they have a parallel arrangement in the fasciculi into which they are collected, the fasciculi themselves are irregularly interlaced, at the same time that they all pursue a com- "'rhe'rauscular coat of nearly the entire alimentary canal consists essentially of these invo- luntary or organic muscular fibres ; but at the commencement and termination of the canal, where the mSscular systems of animal and organic life come into relation with each other this tunic appears also to consist of fibres resembling those of the voluntary muscles.

Vessels and nerves also enter into the formation of the alimentary canal: for example, we tind a very abundant supply of branches from the adjacent arterial trimks ; an immense number of veins, ot which those from the sub-diaphragmatic portion of the canal terminate in the venaportse; absorbent vessels, divided into lymphatics and lacteals ; and lastly nerves, ahnost aU of which proceed from the ganglionic system, excepting the pneumogas- tric and glosso-pharyngeal nerves. Division of the digestive canal. The digestive canal has been divided into several parts, from differences both in their anatomical characters and their functions. One principal division, which deserves to be retained, is into a supra-diaphrag- matic and a sub-diaphragmatic portion. The supra- diaphragmatic portion comprehends the mouth, the pharynx, and the cesophagus. The infra-diaphrag- matic portion includes the stomach (a h,fig. 139.); the small intestine, subdivided into the duodenum {b c), and the jejunum and ileum (c d); and the large intestine, somewhat arbitrarily divided into the ca:cum (d e), the colon (d h), and the rectum {h i). The appendages of the digestive canal consist of the salivary, glands, connected with the mouth; of the liver and the pancreas, connected with the duodenum; and of the spleen, which may be regarded as an appendage cf the liver. » FThe lining membrane of the digestive apparatus, forming part of the gastro-pulmonary system of the mucous membranes, extends not only throughout the entire aUmentary canal, but also along the ducts of the various glands which pour their secretions into it. Structure in general. Mucous membranes are usually soft, pulpy, incapable of great distension, easily lacerated, somewhat opaque, and, when free from blood, of a pale greyish or ashy hue. The dermis or chorion (analogous to that of the skin) is a basis of cellular tissue, ot very variable thickness ; its attached surface is connected to the subjacent textures, either immove- ably as in the nasal cavities and on the tongue, or loosely, as in the gullet and stomach, ibe pellicle or epithelium with which its surface is always covered (corresponding to the epiuermis of the skin), also varies much in thickness in different situations ; it consists of transparent nucleated cells, according to the form and arrangement of which it receives its name. 1 hus m the squamous epithelium there are generally (as in the mouth and gullet) several layers ot cells: of these the deepest are vesicular, and contain a comparatively large nucleus; those on the surface are flattened out into polygonal scales, from the centre of which the nucleus has nearly dis.ippeared, whilst the intermediate cells present intermediate transitional lorms. _ Ihe nucleated cells of the columnar epithelium (found, for example, in the stomach and intes- tines) are developed into oblong cylinders, arranged in a single series, like basaltic columns, perpendicularly to the surface of the dermis. In some situations, as in the nasal cavities and air passages, cilia are attached to the free extremities of the cylinders of the columnar epithe- lium, but no cilia have been detected in any part of the alimentary canal of man, or the warm- blooded animals : the superficial cells of the epithelium of mucous membranes are continually being thrown off by a process of desquamation. The different raucous membranes differ in428 SPLANCHNOLOGY. The MouTfi and its Appenbages. The mouth* is a cavity situated at the entrance of the digestive passages. It occupies the lower part of the face] and is situated between the two jaws below the nasal fossse, between the cheeks, behind the lips, and in front of the pharynx. It constitutes a very complicated apparatus, in which are performed the several acts of masti- cation, tasting, and insalivation, the commencement of the act of deglu- tition, and the articulation of sounds. The dimensions of the buccal ca- vity are greater than those of the succeeding portion of the alimentary canal; hence bodies may be intro- duced into it which are too large to pass through the constricted parts of that canal.f The size of the mouth presents every intermediate degree between complete closure with the jaws in contact, and leaving no in- terval between them, and extreme expansion, when the buccal cavity represents a quadrangular pyramid, the base of which is directed forwards, and the apex backwards. An increase in the capacity of the mouth may also be eflfected in the transverse direction by the distension of the cheeks, and in the antero-posterior direction by a projection of the lips forwards. In studying the relative proportions of the several diameters of the buccal cavity, it is found that none of them predominates in man, while in the lower animals the antero-posterior is by far the longest: this depends partly on the great size of their nasal cavities, and partly on the length of their jaws. In connection with this subject, we may remark that in the animal series there is an inverse ratio between the size of the cavity of the cranium and that of the gustatory and olfactory cavities. vascularity ; the network of capillary vessels in the dermis becomes closer or denser near its surface; the lymphatic vessels also form a network in the same situation ; but the epithelium, though organised, is, as stated in the text, perfectly extra-vascular. Mucous membranes are also more or less abundantly supplied with nerves. When boiled they yield no gelatine, or rather only as much as would proceed from the cel- lular tissue and vessels they contain. The fluid secreted by them, or mucus, is viscid, trans- parent, and colourless, miscible with, but not soluble in water, and not coagulated by heat. It contains, besides the desquamated epithelium scales, proper granular globules, inch in dia- meter, and having a very close resemblance to the globules of pus. According to Berzelius, mucus consists of water, a few salts, albumen, and a peculiar animal substance, which he cills mucous matter. This latter, when dried, swells on being placed in water, but, like fresh mucus, is insoluble in that fluid, either hot or cold ; it is slightly soluble in dilute acetic and nitric acids, and in caustic alkalies. The peculiarities presented by particular portions of the mucous membranes, and the struc- ture of the papillie, villi, follicles, &c. found in some parts of them, will be separately noticed, as opportunity offers.] * The meaning of the word mouth, in anatomy, differs from the ordinary acceptation ol the term, which is usually applied, not to the buccal cavity, but to its orifice. t As a general rule, the proportion between the different parts of tlio alimentary canal is such, that the upper portion will not admit bodies too large for the lower; and though the buccal cavity forms an exception to the rule, it is because the food, whilst it remains in that situation, is under the influence of the will.THE LIPS. 429 In man, the direction or axis of the mouth is horizontal- an arrangement ^vhich is connected with his destination for the biped position If man as- sumed the attitude of a quadruped, the axis of his mouth would be vertical; M hereas, in the lower animals, it is directed obliquely to the horizon. Form. The mouth (fig. 140.) represents a perfectly symmetrical oval cavity, the great extremity of which is in front. It has an upper wall, viz the arch of the palate (a) ; a loiaerwall, consisting principally of the tongue (6) ; a pos- terior tvull, formed by the velum palati (c) ; an anterior «;a//, composed of the lips (d) on one plane, and of the alveolar arches and the teeth (e) on another ; and two lateral walls, formed by the same arches, by the teeth, and by tbe cheeks. It has two openings—one anterior (m), constituting the orihceot the mouth; the other posterior (2, Jigs. 140, 141.), establishing a communication between the buccal cavity and the pharynx, and on account of its narrowness called the isthmus of the fauces. We shall now describe these parts in succession, excepting the maxillary bones and the teeth, which have been already treated of. The salivary glands which pour their secretions into the buccal cavity will be described as appen- dages to it. The Lips. The lips, forming the anterior wall of the mouth, are two moveable, exten- sible, and contractile curtains, which ciixumscribe its orifice. They are dis- tinguished into upper and lower. Their direction is vertical like that of the alveolar and dental arches upon which they are applied. This direction is peculiar to the human species, and is more marked in the Caucasian race; lips projecting forwards, like those of the lower animals, and not placed upon the same vertical plane, give a mean expression to the physiognomy. The depth of the lips is measured by that of the alveolar and dental arches. The upper is deeper than the lower lip. The two lips offer for our consideration an anterior or cutaneous surface, a posterior or mucous surface, an attached and a free border, and two commis- sures. The anterior surface. In the upper lip this surface presents along the median line a vertical furrow, the sub-nasal groove, commencing at the septum of the nose, and terminating below in a tubercle, which is more or less prominent in different individuals. This furrow is the vestige of a division in the lip, natural to many mammalia. The malformation, termed single hare-lip, always occupies one of the edges of this groove ; in double hare-lip both of them are affected. On each side, the upper lip is convex, and covered with a slight down in the female, and before puberty in the male, but after that period with long and stiff hairs directed obliquely outwards. The aspect of the anterior surface of the lower lip is inclined a little downwards ; the middle portion only of this lip, which presents no median depression, is covered with hairs. The posterior surface. Each lip is free behind excepting in the median line, where we find a small fold of mucous membrane called the frcenum labii.- it is more marked in the upper than in the lower lip. This surface is always moist, and is in contact with the alveolar and dental arches. The complete independence of the lips, as regards the maxillary bones, explains the extreme mobility of these membranous organs.* Adherent borders of the lips. The lips are bounded at their posterior surface by the reflection of the mucous membrane upon the jaw, so that there is a deep and vciy remarkable furrow between the lips and the maxillary bones, which may be regarded as an anterior buccal cavity, or the vestibule of the mouth. The upper lip is bounded in front by the base of the nose ; on each side it is separated from the cheeks by the projection of the inner margin of the levator * Mtunmalia alone have lips that are moveable, independently ol' the jaws: but this inde~ peiulcncc is still more marked in man.SPLANCHNOLOGY. labii superioris aloBque nasi: the lower lip is bounded in the median line bv a transverse depression situated between it and the chin, called the mcnto-labial turrow, which is remarkable for the perpendicular direction of the hairs grow- ing upon It; on each side it is separated from the cheeks by the proiectinir inner margin of the triangularis oris. • j b The line or furrow which separates on either side the lips from the cheek commences at the ala of the nose, and is called the naso-lahial line*: it would be more appropriately named the bucco-labial line or furrow. The boundaries between the lips and the cheeks are then entirely artificial: the two lips, taken together, represent an ellipse, the longest diameter of which is transverse. The free borders of the lips. The free borders of the lips are rounded, are covered by a red integument intermediate in character between skiu and mucous membrane, and are marked by folds or wrinkles directed at right angles to the length of the lips, and produced by the contraction of the orbi- cularis oris muscle. These free borders, which are as it were everted, espe- cially that of the lower lip, present anteriorly a well-marked line of separation between the skin and the mucous membrane; they describe an undulating line, which attracts the attention of the painter more than that of the anatomist. The chief characters of the free margin of the upper lip are, a slight pro- jection in the middle Line, and a slight depression on either side: those of the free border of the lower lip are a median depression and two lateral pro- jections ; on meeting together, these borders come into accurate contact, and completely close the opening of the mouth. The free margins of the lips are, moreover, their thickest part, and they are thicker in the middle than at each extremity; their thickness also varies greatly in different individuals. In general, thick lips are regarded as indicating a scrofulous diathesis; but in forming an opinion upon this subject, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between size resulting frorn hypertrophy of the muscular layer, and that which is caused by an excess of skin and cellular tissue. In the Ethiopian race, the size of the lips is entirely due to the great developement of the muscles. The commissures. The lateral extremities of the free margins of the lips are thin, and by their union form the angles or commissures of the lips (from committo, to join together). The anterior orifice of the mouth. The free edges of the lips intercept a transverse fissure, viz. the anterior opening of the mouth. The variable size of this orifice in man has given rise to the distinctions of middle-sized, large, and small mouths: the difference, however, is confined to the opening, and does not at aU affect the buccal cavity properly so called. The anterior opening of the lips is also exceedingly dilatable, and accordingly admits the introduction of very large bodies, and renders the exploration of every part of the cavity of the mouth comparatively easy. Structure of the lips. The lips are composed of two tegumentary layers, one cutaneous, the other mucous ; of a muscular layer; of a series of glands; and of vessels, nerves, and cellular tissue. The cutaneous layer. This is remarkable for its density and thickness, for the size of the hair follicles, which are partially situated beneath it, and for its intimate adhesion to the muscular layer; so that it is impossible to separate them by dissection without encroaching upon one or the other. This laj er may be regarded as the framework of the lips. It is endowed with an exqui- site sensibility, and, in many animals, possesses so delicate a sense of touch, that the slightest movement of the extremities of the long hairs with which it is provided, at once warns the animal of the presence of approaching objects. The mucous layer. This is remarkable from the existence of an epithelium upon it, which can be very easily demonstrated. It covers the free edge of * Mucli importance is attached to this furrow in semeiology. It is termed the abdominal line, because it becomes remarkably distinct in diseases of the abdomen431 THE LIPS. the lips so that by a rare exception a portion of this mucous membrane is habiUially exposed to the external air. It adheres more firmly at the free ^dffe of the lip than elsewhere.* . , , The glandular layer. This is a thick layer, situated between the mucous and the muscular layers, and causing an elevation of the former. It consists of small spheroidal glands, of unequal size, placed close to each other, but per- fectly distinct; when examined with a lens they resemble small salivary glands, each being provided with an excretory duct, opening by a separate orifice upon the posterior surface of the mucous membrane.f These are true labial salivary glands, and not muciparous follicles. The muscidar layer. This is composed essentially of a single proper muscle, the orbicularis oris, into which almost all the muscles of the face are in- serted, viz. the levator labii superioris aleeque nasi, the levator labii superioris, the depressor alse nasi, the naso-labialis, and the zygomaticus minor (where it exists) for the upper lip; the quadratus menti and the levator labii inferioris for the lower lip ; the buccinator (which we have regarded as forming the or- bicularis by its bifurcation extending to both lips), and the zygomaticus major, the triangularis oris, the levator anguli oris, and the risorius of San- torini (where it exists) to the commissures. Including the orbicularis oris, there are twenty-five muscles. The differences presented by the free edges of the lips in diflFerent individuals depend upon variations in the thickness of the corresponding portion of the orbicularis. No fibrous tissue enters into the composition of the lips and their commisr sures, which are exclusively formed of fleshy fibres: hence they are extremely extensible, a circumstance of which the surgeon avails himself in operating upon parts situated in the buccal cavity and pharynx. Vessels, nerves, and cellular tissue. Few parts are so abundantly provided with vessels and nerves as the lips. The arteries of the lips are derived from two principal sources : the coronary arteries arise from the facial; the buccal, infra-orbital, and alveolar arteries destined for the upper lip, and the mental artery for the lower lip, arise from the internal maxillary. The sub-mental artery, a branch of the facial, and the transversalis faciei, a branch of the tem- poral, also give off some ramifications to the lips. The veins bear the same names, and follow the same direction as the arteries; the lymphatic vessels, which are little known, terminate in the glands at the base of the jaw. The nerves are derived from two distinct sources, viz. from the fifth and the seventh pairs of cranial nerves. The cellular tissue contained in the substance of the lips is essentially of a serous nature. It is liable to a considerable amount of serous infiltration; but even in the fattest individuals, it contains only a very small quantity of adipose tissue. Developement. According to Blumenbach and most modern anatomists, the upper lip is originally developed from three points or three distinct parts—one median and two lateral. Some have even gone further, and have maintained that the median point itself is originally formed of two lateral halves, which be- come united at a very early period. This hypothesis is founded partly upon the nature of the divisions in simple and double hare-lip, each of which has been as- sumed to be nothing more than an arrest of devolopement; also, upon the mode of developement of the superior maxillary bones, the alveolar border of which, it is said, is composed of four pieces—two median or incisor, and two lateral; and lastly, upon the permanent existence of these divisions in some animals. In opposition to this view, however, we may state, first, the absence in the human foetus of distinct bony pieces, corresponding to the ossa incisiva of the lower * [The mucous membrane upon the free borders of the lip is provided with papillte.

The length of the lips of the new born infant is well adapted for the act of sucking, and depends upon the absence of the teeth. To the same cause and to the wasting of the alveolar borders, the length of the lips in advanced ase must be referred. ^ Uses. The lips, constituting the anterior wall of the mouth, form a sort of barrier in front of the teeth, and alveolar arches, by which the saliva is retained within that cavity. So great is the importance of the lips in preventing a con- tinual escape of the saliva, that in cases where they have been destroyed the constant draining away of that fluid may become a cause of exhaustion and even of death.f They are employed, also, in drinking, sucking, and blowing; in playing upon wmd-instruments, and in uttering articulate sounds. They are also of great importance in the expression of the passions, which, as we have seen, influence all the muscles of the face. Pride, contempt, joy, grief, anger, and every possible gradation of feeling, are depicted in a striking manner upon the outline of the lips. The mouth is more particularly the seat of grimaces, which are nothing more than the expression of passions ridiculously exagge- The Cheeks. The cheeks form the lateral walls of the mouth and the sides of the face. They are bounded internally by the reflection of the mucous membrane upon the maxillary bones : externally their limits are much less defined, and are thus determined on each side of the face ; in front, by the bucco-labial furrow, which separates them from the lips ; behind, by the posterior border of the ramus of the lower jaw ; above, by the base of the orbit; and below, by the base of the lower jaw. The cheeks then comprise three very distinct regions : the malar, the masseteric, and the buccal, properly so called. Each cheek is quadrilateral in form, and presents, 1. an external or cutaneous surface on which is observed, above, the projection of the cheek, called the malar eminence, and lower down, a surface, which is convex and smooth in stout persons, but hollow and wrinkled in the emaciated ; 2. an internal or mucous surface, free and con-esponding to the alveolar and dental arches. On this surface is situ- ated the orifice of the Stenonian duct, opposite the interval which separates the first from the second upper large molar tooth. Structure. Each cheek, properly so called, is composed of the following parts: the malar bone and the ramus of the lower jaw; a cutaneous layer, increased in thickness by a great quantity of fat; a mucous, a glandular, a muscular, and an aponeurotic layer; some vessels and nerves, and an ex- cretory duct. "We shall make a few remarks upon these difierent layers, com- mencing with the skin. The skin is remarkable for its firmness and vascularity over the cheek bone, and also for the facility with which it is injected, or becomes pale under the influence of the moral feelings : it is covered with hair on the lower and back part in the adult male. * The admirable researches of M. Velpeau upon embryology fully confirm the results at which I have arrived. t This use is principally confined to the lower lip, and it is remarkable that this lip is never affected by congenital fissure. Another singular and also totally inexplicable fact is, that cancer, which is so common a disease, never affects the upper, but invariably the lower lip.THE CHEEKS. 433 The mucous membrane is a continuation of that of the lips, and presents the same characters. The glandular layer is formed by the buccal salivary glands, which exactly resemble the labial glands, but are smaller, and like them cause projections of the mucous membrane, upon Avhich they open by distinct orifices. Two of these glands have obtained a particular appellation, because they are not sub- jacent to the mucous membrane, but are situated between the buccinator and the masseter muscles: they are called the molar glands. Their excretory ducts open opposite the last molar tooth. The muscular layer is formed, in the masseteric region, by the masseter and a part of the platysma; in the malar region, by the orbicularis palpebrarum; in the buccal region, properly so called, by the buccinator, and the two zygo- matici. The aponeurotic layer is formed by the aponeurosis of the buccinator muscle. The adipose layer is thin in the malar and masseteric regions, and very thick in the buccal region, properly so called. Bichat has, moreover, pointed out a mass of fat in the substance of the cheek, between the buccinator and the mas- seter. It is highly developed in the infant, and vestiges of it are found even in the most emaciated individuals, and in extreme old age. The arteries of the cheeks come, partly, from the facial and the transverse artery of the face, and partly from the internal maxillary : the branches from the internal maxillary belong to the infra-orbital, the inferior dental, the buccal, the masseteric, and the alveolar arteries. The veins bear the same name, and follow the same course as the arteries. The lymphatic vessels pass into the cervical and parotid lymphatic glands. The nerves of the cheeks, like those of the lips, are derived from two sources, viz. the buccal and malar nerves, from the portio dura of the seventh pair, and the buccal, masseteric, infra-orbital, and mental branches of the fifth pair. The cheek is perforated by the duct of Steno (s,fig. 144.), -which runs hori- zontally foi-wards below the malar bone. Developement. The absence of the teeth, the presence of a large quantity of fat (more especially the great size of the mass above noticed), the want of height in the superior maxilla, from the non-developement of the sinus, and lastly the obtuse angle of the lower jaw, give to the cheek of the infant its characteristic fulness. The loss of the teeth and the wasting of the alveolar borders in the aged diminish the inter-maxillary space; so that their emaciated cheeks become disproportionately long, and consequently display a looseness, which forms one of the chief peculiarities in their physiognomj-. At puberty, the cheeks of the male are covered with hair. Uses. The cheeks form lateral active walls of the mouth, which, closely applying themselves against the alveolar arches and teeth, force the food be- tween the latter, and thus assist in mastication. They are employed, also, in suction, in the articulation of sounds, and in playing upon wind-instruments. In the expression of the passions they assist rather by changes in their colour, than by any distinct movements. The cheeks and the lips constitute the outer wall of a supernumerary buccal cavity, of which the inner wall is formed by the alveolar borders and the teeth. This cavity, a sort of vestibule to the buccal cavity, properly so caUed, is very dilatable. It may be considered as a kind of reservoir, in which the food IS deposited, in order to be submitted in successive portions to the action of the masticatory organs. This vestibular buccal cavity is provided with labial and buccal salivary glands. It is also interesting to find that the parotid glands, the largest of all the salivary glands, pour their secretion into this cavity. roj,. I.SPLANCHNOLOGY. 434 The Palatine Arch and the Gums. The palatine arch, or the hard palate ia,fiy. 140.), constitutes the upper wall of the buccal cavity. It has the form of a parabolic arch, bounded in front and on either side by the teeth, and behind by the velum palati, into which it is continued without any distinct line of demarcation. Upon it we observe, in the median line, an antero-posterior raphe, at the anterior extremity of which is a tubercle corresponding to the lower orifice of the anterior palatine canal. This tubercle has been incorrectly stated by physiologists to be endowed with a peculiar sensibility ; on each side and in front there are transverse ridges, more or less marked in different individuals, which represent the still more highly developed ridges, bars, or calcareous concretions, which render the surface of the roof of the palate in some animals so rugged. Posteriorly the roof of the palate is perfectly smooth. Structure. The constituent parts of the palatine arch are, an osseous frame- work, a fibro-mucous membrane, a layer of glands, with vessels and nerves. The framework consists of the bony palate already described: it is thicker in front than behind, and is held up in the middle by the sort of column formed by the vomer and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, and behind and on each side by the vertical portions of the palate bones, and by the pterygoid processes. We have already noticed the asperities which it presents, and which appear to have no other object than to secure the intimate adhesion of the fibro-mucous membrane to the bones. The palatine and gingival membrane. This mucous membrane is remarkable for its whitish colour; for the thickness of its epithelium, especially in front; for the thickness and density of its chorion, which even approaches to that of the corresponding tissue in the skin; for its close adhesion to the bones, into which the chorion sends off well-marked fibro-cellular prolongations ; and lastly, for the great number of orifices with which it is perforated, especially behind. This excessive thickness of the palatine membrane, however, is ob- served only anteriorly, and most particularly so behind the incisor teeth. The glandular layer. In the median line the palatine membrane is blended with the periosteum of the bones, but on each side it is separated from it by a very thick layer of glands, which are sometimes arranged in regular rows along the antero-posterior groove presented by the palatine arch. These palatine salivary glands are exactly similar to the labial and buccal glands already described; they are much more numerous behind than in front, and open upon the membrane by a number of orifices, visible to the naked eye. There are often two openings much more distinctly marked than the rest, situated one on either side of the posterior extremity of the median raphe. The gums. The description of the peculiar tissue of the gums, to which some allusion has been made in speaking of the teeth, naturally follows that of the palatine membrane. The term gums {qvKo) is applied to those portions of the buccal mucous membrane which surround the teeth. They are dis- tinguished from the rest of that membrane by their intimate adhesion to the periosteum, by their thickness, and especially by their almost cartilaginous density, which enables them to resist the shocks of hard bodies during masti- cation. ' In this latter respect, and in regard to their want of sensibility, the gums closely resemble the contiguous portions of the palatine membrane. They commence about a line from the base of the alveoli, their limits being marked by a scalloped ridge. Having reached the free margins, i. e. the base of the alveoli, the gums continue their course for the space of about a line beyond that point, as far as the neck of the teeth, where they become reflected upon themselves. The point of reflection is a free border of a semi- lunar shape, corresponding to the indented, and as it were festooned, border of each alveolus. The denticulations or longest portions of the gums correspond to the intervals between the teeth, in which situation the processes of the gum,THE VELUM PALATI. 435 F F 2 covering the anterior and posterior surfaces of the alveoli, communicate with each other. The reflected portion of the gum, though not adhering to, is in contact with, all that portion of the root of the tooth which projects above the alveolus ; it then dips into the cavity of the latter, so as to form the alveolo- dentalperiosteum, which, as we have already seen, is a powerful means of con- necting the fang of the tooth to its socket. The tissue of the gums appears to be provided with particular follicles for the secretion of the tartar.* It varies much in different individuals, both in colour and in density. One of its most peculiar characters is the singular effect produced on it by scurvy and by mercury, under the influence of which agents it becomes softened and fungous, easily bleeds, and furnishes a large quantity of tartar. * Another, but purely anatomical character consists in its largely developed openings or pores, which in a particular light are even visible to the naked eye. The gums are almost insensible when divided by cutting instruments; but the pressure exerted upon them by the teeth during the eruption of the latter, often gives rise to the most serious affections. Vessels and nerves of the roof of the palate and the gums. The arteries arise, some from the internal maxillary, viz. the posterior palatine, the alveolar, the infra-orbital, and the mental branches ; others from the facial, viz. the superior coronary for the gums of the upper, and the sub-mental branches for those of the lower jaw; the sublingual artery also supplies the latter. The veins bear the same name. All the nerves proceed from the fifth pair, viz. the palatine and the superior and inferior dental branches. The naso-palatine nerve sends ramifications to the small median tubercle upon the roof of the palate. Few parts have so little cellular tissue as the gums. Developsment. According to the best authorities the bony and membranous portions of the hard palate are developed from two lateral points which unite aJong the median line, so that the malformation, known by the name of hare- bp with cleft palate, is said to be an arrest of developement. The fissure may be either smgle or double in front. If the cleft be double, that portion of the upper jaw, which supports the incisor teeth, is separated on both sides from the rest of the bone. Such divisions always seem to me to be absolutely depar- tures from nature t, for at no period of its growth can such separations or clefts be detected m a naturally formed fcetus. Uses of the gums and hard palate. The hard palate separates the buccal cavity from the nasal fossa. It serves as a fulcrum for the tongue in the act of tasting, m mastication, deglutition, and the articulation of sounds. Before the eruption of the teeth, the gums completely close the alveoli and serve as the .t^^f ^r^^*' of mastication ; and they become hard, and supply the place of the teeth after the loss of those organs.

The velum palati, or soft palate (c, fig. 140.), is a muscular and membranous valve, which prolongs the palatine arch backwards, and therefore might be called the membranous palatine arch. It is a sort of incomplete septum (septum staphylin, Chauss.), dividing the buccal cavity from the nasal fossse and the pharynx. Its direction is curved : its upper portion is horizontal, but it soon becomes curved and passes almost directly downwards (velum pendulum palati). In the act of deglutition, the velum becomes horizontal during the passage of the alimentary mass, but immediately afterwards returns to its oblique and pen- dulous position, and thus tends to prevent the return of the food into the mouth. In several pathological conditions the velum is thrown backwards and upwards, and adheres to the posterior orifices of the nasal fossse. AU these changes of direction affect the oblique and not the horizontal portion of the velum. The velum palati is broad, quadrilateral, and perfectly symmetrical Its inferior or buccal surface is concave, and continuous with the hard palate without any line of demarcation. This surface is very well seen when the mouth is opened, and is therefore easily accessible to the surgeon. In the median line it presents a white raphe, which is a continuation of the median raphe of the hard palate; it is formed by a small fibrous cord, causing a projection under the mucous membrane. The superior or nasal surface of the velum (^fig. 141.) is convex : it prolongs the floor of the nasal fossa;, and, from its obliquity, directs the mucus into the pharynx. This surface presents a median projection produced above by the palato-staphylin muscles (azygos uvulae (o) ), and below by a mass of glands. Congenital division of the velum is always situated in the median line, and is followed by so great a retraction of its two halves, that, in some cases, the entire absence of the velum has been suspected. Its upper border is thick, and firmly united to the posterior border of the hard palate. Its lower border is free, extremely thin and concave, and forms the upper boundary of the isthmus (t,fig. 141.) of the fauces : it presents, in the middle line, a sort of appendix or prolongation, call the uvula (u,fig. 140.) : this is of a conical shape, and of very variable size and length; it is capable of consider- able elongation, and may then reach the base of the tongue, but not, as has been supposed, the upper orifice of the larynx.* It is not very uncommon to find it ViM, and sometimes it is entirely wanting. The two lateral borders of the velum limit it on each side, and separate it from the cheek. This boundary is indicated (on each side) by a prominent ridge (before ffig. 140.), extending from the posterior extremity of the upper to the corresponding part of the lower alveolar border. This prominence corresponds to the anterior margin of the internal pterygoid muscle, and is formed in a great measure by a series of smaU glandular structures, which are collected behind the last great molar tooth of the lower jaw into a considerable mass resembling a small gland. , , , n The pillars of the velum palati. These are two lateral columns or pillars, having an arched form, and distinguished into anterior (behind /, fig. 140.) and vosterlor (o), which pass down on either side from the uvula. Each of the anterior pillars (the two forming together the anterior arch of the fauces) pro- ceeds from the base of the uvula outwards, and then vertically downwards, de- scribino- a curve with its concavity directed inwards, and terminates at the sides of the tongue, opposite the anterior extremities of the V-shaped series of pa- pilte vallaL fouiid upon that organ. Each of the posterior pdlars t°ge- [her form the posterior arch of the fauces) commences at t^e apex of the uvula, and immediately curves into an arch, having a smaUer diameter than that * ,n consultation upon a case of chronic larvngUis 1 w^^^^ eeHororf«c'e\??L'V^^^^^^ Z^yfa fe^^ Une, in adv^ance of the epiglottis.THE VELUM PALATI.

In order to have a good idea ot it, it is necessary to make a vertical section of the head from before backwards A sort of recess wiU then be observed, narrow and shallow above but very broad and deep below, especiaUy when the tonsil (n) is smaU. The base of this tossa corresponds anteriorly to the base of the tongue (6), then to the epiglottis {i), the larynx, and the walls of the pharynx: the bottom of the fossa corresponds to the angle of the lower jaw and the lateral portion of the supra-hyoid region, where it is separated from the skin only by a thin layer of soft tissues. Ihe dunensions of this fossa always remain the same above, but are very variable below, according as the tongue is retained in the mouth or protruded. The isthmus faucium. The posterior orifice of the buccal cavity is caUed the isthmus fawium (2, figs. 140, 141.). It is a sort of passage between the buccal and the pharyngeal cavities, bounded below by the base of the tongue, above by the free margin of the velum palati, divided into two arches by the uvula in the middle, and the two piUars on each side. This posterior orifice of the mouth, though very dilatable, is less so than the anterior opening of the same cavity. It may be contracted, and even completely closed, not only from inflammation of the tonsils and arches of the fauces, but also from the con- traction of the muscles which enter into the formation of the velum and its pillars. This may be seen by watching the movements of the isthmus of the fauces, in a person who will submit to such an examination. These differences in the dimensions of the isthmus are concerned not only in deglutition, but also in the modulations or articulations of the voice. Structure. In the velum palati we find an aponeurotic framework; also certain muscles by which it is moved, which are either extrinsic or intrinsic. The intrinsic muscles are those constituting the azygos uvulffi, viz. the palato- staphylini; and the extrinsic muscles are four on each side, two descend- ing, viz. the levator palati, and the circumflexus or tensor palati, and two ascending, viz. the palato-glossus and the palato-pharyngeus. We also find in the soft palate a thick layer of glands, vessels, nerves, and cellular tissue ; and lastly, a covering of mucous membrane. The aponeurotic portion. The aponeurotic portion, or rather the principal aponeurosis, is extremely dense, and continues the hard palate backwards: it is generally regarded as an expansion of the reflected tendons of the tensores palati, but it is in a great measure formed of proper fibres continuous with the fibrous tissue, which prolongs backwards the septum narium, the outer borders of the posterior orifices of the nasal fossae, and the fibrous portion of the Eustachian tube. Below this aponeurotic membrane there is another fibrous lamella, continuous with the fibrous tissue found in the hard palate. The framework of the upper half of the velum palati may therefore be said to be formed of two fibrous layers, one superior, the other inferior, between which the glandular layer is situated. Lastly, a small fibrous band extends from the nasal spine to the uvula, along the median raphe upon the lower surface of the velum, producing a slight elevation of the mucous membrane. This little band sends off a prolongation between the glands of the velum, which separates the right half of the soft palate from the left.SPLANCHNOLOGY. 438 The Muscles of the Velum Palali. Dissection. This is common to all the muscles of the soft palate It is merely necessary to remove the mucous membranes and the subjacent elands in order to study the arrangement of these muscles, and to follow the £cend- mg and descending fibres which emerge from or enter into the velum. The Azygos Uvuloe, or Palato-slaphylini. The palato-staphyUni (a, fig. Ul.) are two smaU, fleshy, cylindrical bands Fiif. u\. P^^<=ed in contact, one on each side of the median • line, and extending from the posterior nasal spine, or rather from the aponeurosis continuous with it^ to the base of the uvula. They are covered by the mucous membrane of the nose, under which they form a projection, and they cover the leva- tores palati. The two muscles, from their juxta- position, appear, at first sight, to form a single rounded muscle, to -which the names, azygos uvulce, columella musculus teres, have been given. Action. To raise the uvula. The Levator Palati, or Peristaphylinus Intemus. Dissection. Remove the mucous membrane from a vertical ridge which exists along the outer border of the posterior orifice of one of the nasal fossa;, behind the Eustachian tube; then re- move the mucous membrane covering the upper surface of the soft palate. The vertical portion of the levator palati (le petro-salpingo staphylin, Winslow; petro-staphylin, Chauss., c,figs. 141. 146.) is situated upon the outer side of the posterior orifice of the corresponding nasal fossa; its horizontal portion is in the substance of the velum: it is thick, narrow, and rounded above, expanded and triangular below. It arises by short tendinous fibres from the lower surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone near its apex, and from the contiguous part of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube. From these points its fibres pass obliquely downwards and inwards, turning round the outer side of the tube. At the outer border of the velum palati the muscle becomes horizontal, and its fasciculated fibres diverge, so as to cover the whole extent of the antero-posterior diameter of the velum. The anterior fleshy fasciculi are inserted by short tendinous fibres into the posterior border of the aponeurosis of the soft palate. The others also ter- minate by very short tendinous fibres, which are blended in the median line ■with those of the opposite side, immediately below the azygos uvulae. Relations. It is covered by the mucous membrane of the pharynx and soft, palate ; its vertical portion is in relation, on the outside, with the circumflexus palati and the superior constrictor muscles, and its horizontal portion with the palato-pharyngeus. It forms the uppermost muscular layer of the soft palate. Action. It raises the velum (elevator palati mollis, Albin., Soemm.). The length of its fibres, its direction, and its shape, render it well fitted for this pur- pose. It should be remarked that the tendinous portion of the velum scarcely participates in the movement of elevation. The Circumflexus or Tensor Palati, or the Peristaphylinus Extemus. This is a thin, flat, and reflected muscle (le pterygo- or spheno-salpingo sia- \i\\y\\n,Winsl.; pterygo-staphylin, Chauss.'), and is tendinous for a considerable439 THE PALATO-GLOSSUS. part of its extent; its vertical portion {d, fig. 141. 146.) is situated along the internal plate of the pterygoid process, to the inner side of the internal ptery- goid muscle (b\ and its horizontal portion {d) in the substance of the yelum. Attachments. It arises from the fossa navicularis, at the base of the internal pterygoid plate, from the contiguous part of the great wing of the sphenoid, and from a small portion of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube. From these points the muscle, which forms a thin fasciculus, flattened at the side passes verticaUy downwards: near the hamular process of the internal pterygoid plate it becomes a shining tendon, which changes its direction, and is reflected at a right angle under that process: it is retained m this situation by a small Ugament, and its motions are facilitated by a synovial membrane. The tendon then passes horizontally inwards, expands, and becomes blended with the aponeurotic membrane. . , , . Relations. Its vertical portion is in relation on the outside with the internal pterygoid, and on the inside with the levator palati, from which it is separated by the superior constrictor of the pharynx {g,fig. 141.) and by the internal pterygoid plate. Its horizontal or aponeurotic portion is anterior to the levator palati, and has the same relation as the aponeurotic portion of the velum. Action. It is a tensor of the aponeurotic portion (tensorpalati), but does not otherwise move the velum. As Haller has remarked, when its fixed point is below, it can dilate the Eustachian tube. The Falato-pharyngeus, or Pharyngo-staphylinus. This muscle (thyro-staphylinus, Douglas, ee,fig. 141.) is narrow and fascicu- lated in the middle, where it is situated in the posterior piUar of the fauces, broad and membranous at its extremities, one of which is in the velum and the other in the pharynx. Attachments. It arises from the whole extent of the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage. From this point it passes vertically upwards, and forms a broad and thin muscular layer, the fibres of which are first collected into a fasciculus or muscular column, which enters the posterior pillar of the fauces, and then again expanding occupy the whole extent of the antero-posterior diameter of the velum, and unite in the median line with the muscle of the opposite side, so as to form an arch. The anterior fibres are inserted into the posterior border of the aponeurosis of the velum. Relations. It forms the lowest muscular stratum of the velum : it is separated from the mucous membrane below by the layer of glands: it is in relation above with the muscular layer formed by the expansion of the levator palati. In the posterior pillar it is in relation with the mucous membrane, which covers it in all directions, excepting on the outside. In the pharynx it forms the innermost muscular layer, i. e. it lies between the constrictors and the mucous membrane. Action. The two palato-pharyngei draw the velum downwards, and press it strongly against the alimentary mass during deglutition; they therefore form a constrictor of the isthmus of the fauces. When they take their fixed points above, they raise the posterior wall of the pharynx. They are important agents in deglutition. The Palato-glossus, or Glosso-staphylinus. This is a small fleshy bundle (p,fig. 141.) situated in the anterior pillar of the fauces, narrow in the middle, and broad at the extremities. Its lower ex- tremity is expanded upon the side of the tongue, and is united with the stylo- glossus. Its upper extremity spreads out in the velum palati, and becomes blended with that of the palato-pharyngeus. Its middle portion is very slender; it forms the anterior pillar, and is visible through the thin mucous membrane by which it is covered. J? F 4SPLANCHNOLOGY. Action. The two muscles depress the velum palati, and raise the edges of tne base ot the tongue; they consequently constrict the isthmus faucium i ne glandular layer of the velum palati. Under the mucous membrane cover mg the upper surface of the velum palati, there are some scattered glands which are more numerous on the sides than along the middle. But on the lower surface of the velum there is a much more obvious collection of glands particularly dense, opposite the aponeurotic portion of the velum, and forming a continuation of the glandular layer of the hard palate. Similar glands are found in the uvula, the size, and in some measure the form, of which they determine. These smaU glands in the velum exactly resemble the salivary glands already described as existing in the lips, the cheeks, and the roof of the palate. The mucous membrane. Both surfaces of the velum are covered by mucous membrane, which constitutes, as it were, its integuments. These two mucous layers are remarkable, inasmuch as each presents the peculiar characters of the cavity to which it belongs. Thus the lower layer preserves the characters of the buccal mucous membrane, and the upper layer those of the nasal.* The two layers are continuous with each other along the free margin of the velum palati; the fold of mucous membrane, forming this margin, passes beyond the other constituent tissues, so that for the space of half a line or a line the two mucous layers are in contact. The same occurs in the uvula, the apex, and sometimes the lower half of which consists of a duplicature of mucous mem- brane, containing some loose cellular tissue, which is very susceptible of in- filtration. Either serous or sanguineous infiltration of the uvula produce an elongation of this part, called relaxation of the uvula. I should not omit to mention the great difference, in regard to sensibility and liability to inflam- mation, that exists between the mucous membrane of the free and adherent borders of the velum palati. Vessels and nerves. These are very numerous in proportion to the size of the part. The arteries arise from the palatine and the superior and inferior pharyngeal. The veins are similarly named, and follow the same course. The lymphatic vessels, which have been Uttle studied, enter the lymphatic glands at the angle of the jaw. The nerves are derived from the palatine branches given off by Meckel's ganglion, and from the glosso-pharyngeus. Develnpement. We have here again the question, whether the velum is formed originally from two halves, which afterwards become united in the median line: in favour of this view we may adduce those cases in which the uvula and the velum are bifid, either with or without fissure of the hard palate and lip. In the youngest embryos which I have examined, I have always found the velum undivided. Uses. The velum palati is a contractile valve, which fulfils very important functions in deglutition, in the utterance of articulate sounds, and in the modu- lation of the voice; it is capable of being elevated and depressed. Elevation affects its muscular, but not its aponeurotic, portion : this movement cannot be carried so far as to revert the velum upwards. Depression may be carried to such an extent as to close the isthmus faucium by the approximation of the velum and the base of the tongue. The contraction of the palato-pharyngei, which are curved muscles, may be so complete as to bring the posterior pillars of the fauces into contact, and thus close the isthmus in a transverse direction. The uvula moves independently of the velum. When the aponeurosis of the velum palati is rendered tense, the velum itself is enabled to resist both elevation and depression. * [According to the recent researches of Dr. Henle, the ciliated columnar epithelium (like that of the nasal mucous membrane) is found upon the upper surface of the velum, only in the neighbourhood of. and a short distance below, the expanded orifice of the Eustachian tube ; the remaining portion of the upper surface, as well as the free border, and the whole of the lower snrface, are covered with the squamous epithelium, similar to that of the buccal mucous mem- brane.]THE TONGUE. 441 The Tonsils, or Amygdala. The terms amygdala {afivySaXia, an almond) or tonsils, are applied to a group of mucous foUicles {n, fig. 140.), which occupy the interval between the pillars of the fauces on each side. They are placed there on account of the necessity of lubricating the isthmus during the passage of the alimentary mass. Their form pretty nearly resembles that of an almond; they are directed ob- liquely downwards and forwards, and their size is exceedingly subject to either congenital or accidental variation. In some subjects they can scarcely be said to exist; in others theyfill up the whole amygdaloid fossa, and project more or less into the isthmus of the fauces, so as to impede deglutition, or even re- spiration. The compound tonsil results from its component follicles being collected into several distinct masses. The internal surface is free, and may be seen when the base of the tongue is depressed ; it is perforated by foramina, like the ligneous shell of an almond. These foramina, which vary in number and size, have been frequently mis- taken for syphilitic ulcerations. They lead into small cells, in which mucus sometimes collects, and is then ejected in hard fetid lumps, which have been erroneously supposed to be pulmonary tubercles. Its external surface is covered immediately by the aponeurosis of the pharynx*, and then by the superior constrictor. The tonsil corresponds to the angle of the lower jaw. Compression behind this angle, therefore, affects it at once, and causes pain in cases where it is in- flamed. It has an important relation with the internal carotid artery, especi- ally when that vessel describing a curve with the convexity directed inwards touches the tonsil. In front the tonsil is in relation with the anterior pillar of the fauces, and therefore with the palato-glossus muscle ; behind, with the posterior pillar, and accordingly with the palato-pharyngeus muscle. Structure. In structure the tonsils are intermediate between mucous foUicles and glands: they consist of an agglomeration of follicles, continuous with those at the base of the tongue. Groups of these follicles open into small cells or lacunae, which again open upon the internal surface of the tonsil by the fora- mina already described. The mucous membrane covers the inner surface of the tonsil, and, penetrating through the foramina, lines the interior of all the cells. The arteries are very large, considering the size of the organ. They are derived from the labial, the inferior pharyngeal, the lingual, and the superior and inferior palatine. The veins form a plexus round this organ, called the tonsillar plexus : it is a dependence of the pharyngeal plexus. The lymphatic vessels terminate in the glands found near the angle of the jaw ; hence the in- flammation or enlargement of those glands in consequence of inflammation of the tonsil. The lingual and glosso-pharyngeal nerves form a plexus outside the tonsil, which gives off some branches to it. The Tongue. The tongue, the principal organ of taste, is situated within the buccal cavity, and consequently at the commencement of the digestive passages ib,fig. 140.) behmd the lips, which in many animals are organs of prehension ; also behind the teeth, the organs of mastication, and below the organ of smell, which pos- sesses the sense of taste in the lower tribes, and is necessary in all animals for the perception of flavours. It is a muscular organ, free and moveable above before, and on the sides. It is retained in its position by ligaments which attach It to the os hyoides ; and, by muscles connecting it to the same bone, to „=n ""^J'''* aponeurosis explains why the tonsil always becomes cnlarjted inter, nally, and also why abscesses of this part never open externally. »-ui<irgea inter-'^^^ SPLANCHNOLOGY. »ng«e, as some hijlor,™ h„e rel.t.i Nor do I bdLe, ZwiS.io'; The «ze of the tongue, though variable in different individuals is alwavs fo fi^r.r'V'^ '° '^'^"''''^'^ 1°^" j'^^ = it is not large enough to fiU the buccal cavity completely when the jaws are closed.

Its form is determined; and as it were measured, by the parabolic curve of the lower jaw, by which it is circumscribed When separated from the neighbouring parts it represents an ellipse, with its long diameter from before backwards. It is perfectlv symmetrical, flattened above and below, narrow and thin in front, and in- creasing m thickness and in breadth from before backwards. Its figure which has Itself become a term of comparison, does not appear to be essential tor the articulation of sounds, a function that would at first appear to be peculiarly connected with this form. The tongue presents for our consideration an upper and a lower surface two edges, a base, and an apex. ' Tlie upper surface or dorsum of the tongue. This is free in the whole of its extent, corresponds to the roof of the palate, and is divided into two lateral halves by a median furrow, which often limits the progress of disease. It is covered by in- numerable eminences, which render it very rough; these should be distinguished into such as are per- forated, viz. the glandular eminences, and such as are entire, and have no orifice, viz. the papilla (papilla, a nipple). The perforated eminences, or lingual glands, im- properly classed among the papillae, and known under different names, may be distinguished by their circular openings, which are perfectly visible to the naked eye ; by their being situated only at the base of the tongue; by their rounded form, and their having no pedicle ; by the arrangement of the mucous membrane, which passes over with- out adhering to them * ; and lastly by dissection, which most distinctly reveals their glandular na- ture. These lingual glands, moreover, are not follicles, but true glandular organs, analogous to the labial and buccal glands. They form a V- shaped ridge, strongly marked in some subjects, and bounded in front by the ridge (a a, Jig. 142.) of the same shape, formed by the caliciform papillae. • [/. e. without being closely united to their outer surface, as it is to that of the papills. The mucous membrane, as in all glands, is really prolonged into their interior.]443 THE TONGUE. All the other eminences of the tongue are papiUaj which we may describe as the larqe and the small. ,. , Thelarge vapillw are called caliciform : they are arranged in two hnes (a a, fig. 142.), united like the Umbs of a V, open in front. Their number varies from sixteen to twenty, some of which are placed n-regularly. HaUer has seen them forming two rows on each side. Their size is also variable, but they are larger than all the other papiUas. Each papilla forms a truncated and inverted cone, the base of which is free, and the truncated apex adherent, fpapiUEE truncata;, Haller; papilles boutonnees ou a tete, Boyer}. Ihey are placed in a sort of calyx or cup, or surrounded by a circular trench : hence the name of papiUse circumvallatse (papilles caliciformes, Cuvier). The border or rim of this cup is itself a circular papilla.* • ^an At the angle of union of the two rows of these glands is a blind opening which is frequently wanting, and generally known as the foramen caecum of Morgagni (lacune de la langue, Chaussier). Several anatomists of the last century affirmed that certain supposed salivary ducts, which were afterwards shown to be merely veins, had their termination in this foramen ; it is now generally considered to be a cul-de-sac for the reception of the secretion from several follicles; but it appears to me to be only the cavity of a calyx, the papilla corresponding to which is very imperfectly developed. When the papilla is more developed, or the calyx less deep than usual, the foramen cajcum is said to be wanting. The small papillcB. These occupy all that part of the dorsal surface of the tongue, which is in front of the V-shaped ridge formed by the papillae cir- cumvaUatae ; they present many varieties. Some of them are conical, others filiform; some are pointed like a reed, and others are lenticular or fungiform, that is, flattened at the top and supported by a narrow pedicle: but the conical or filiform are evidently the most numerous, for they occupy of themselves the anterior portion and the apex of the tongue, whilst all the other varieties are disseminated between them. They are directed obliquely backwards, so that by rubbing the tongue slightly from behind forwards, they may be brushed up, and their exact shape and length ascertained. This oblique direction is much more marked in the lower animals than in man. The conical papiUse are sometimes arranged in regular or irregular lines, so as to give the tongue a fissured appearance. Sometimes even several papillae are united in a line, so as to form a jagged ridge. We may add, that there is very great variety both in the shape and arrangement of the lingual papiUaj.f The lower surface of the tongue is free only in its anterior third, the muscles which connect the tongue to the neighbouring parts being attached to the posterior two thirds. On the free portion, which we shall alone notice here, is observed a median furrow, more distinct than that on the upper sur- face. At the posterior part of this furrow is a fold of mucous membrane, called the frcenum lingua, which is sometimes prolonged to the apex of the tongue, and prevents the movements of that organ, both in the act of sucking and during articulation: hence the necessity for the operation, known as the di- vision of the fraenum. On each side of this furrow are seen the ranine veins, on which the ancients performed venesection; also an antero-posterior pro- jection formed by the lingual muscle. * The want of an uniform nomenclature for the papilla of the tongue has occasioned great oliscurity. I do not know two authors who agree in this respect. M. Boyer calls the lingual glands, ■papiUes lentimlaires ; the caliciform papillae, papilles boutonnees ou H t4te ; and applies the term papilles conigucs to the papillse generally known by that name. Gavard called the glands, papilles muqueitses ; and the caliciform papittsE, papilles fungiformes. M. H. Cloquet appears to have contounded both the glands and the caliciform papillae under the name of pa- pilles lentieulaires; the papilles fungiformes, according to him, are irregularly disseminated over the edges and apex of the tongue. The use of the term conical papilla, is the only point in which they are all agreed. t [AH these kinds of papilla; are extensions of the mucous membrane, and are therefore com- posed of similar elements. The papillae vallata: contain many loops of vessels, the papilla> conica; in general only a few ; all are abundantly supplied with nerves.]SPLANCHNOLOGY. The edges of the tongue are thick behind, and thinner to-wards the point. The papillas are prolonged in a regular manner upon their upper half in a series of vertical and parallel lines. The actual base is fixed to the os hyoides: the apparent base, -which is seen at the back of the dorsal surface, presents three glosso-epiglottid folds, of which the median (above b,f g. 142.) is much larger than the other two. The apex is situated immediately behind the incisor teeth ; the median fur- rows of both surfaces are prolonged upon it. Having thus examined the peculiarities ofiered by the external surface of the tongue without the aid of dissection, we shall now examine its structure. Structure of the tongue. The tongue being the organ of one of the senses, and being also capable of various movements, we must examine its structure •with reference to both these objects. But after the example of Haller *, we shall be principally occupied here with its structure as a moveable organ. The tongue is essentially composed of muscular fibres, and in this respect the heart is the only organ which can be compared to it. Its framework con- sists of the OS hyoides, of a median cartilaginous lamina, and of its papillary membrane. Framework of the tongue. The os hyoides, already described (seen in fg. 143.), is truly the bone of the tongue : hence it has been called the lingual bone by some anatomists. In man it is not prolonged by a process into the substance of the tongue, as in the lower animals, but is united to it by the hyo-glossal membrane, which commences at the posterior lip of the body of this bone ; and again, since the os hyoides is united to the thyroid cartilage (*) by ligaments, it follows that all the movements of this bone are commu- nicated both to the tongue and to the larynx, between which parts it is situated. From the middle of this fibrous membrane the median cartilaginous lamina of the tongue, described by M. Blandin, proceeds. This lamina, which is per- fectly distinct from the cartilage described by M. Baur in the dog and the wolf f, is situated in the median line ; it is directed vertically, and gives attach- ment to some muscular fibres by its two lateral surfaces ; its upper edge is thin, and reaches the middle of the dorsal region of the tongue; its lower edge is seen between the genio-hyo-glossi, where it is either free or covered by a few muscular fibres which interlace below it. It is thick behind, but thin in front, where its fibres have a number of intervals between them, like those in the septum of the corpora cavernosa penis. I regard the papillary membrane as part of the framework of the tongue, on account of its density, which is so great, that it is with dif5culty cut by the scalpel. Moreover, a great number of the muscular fibres terminate in it. The Muscles of the Tongue. These are either intrinsic or extrinsic. The intrinsic muscles. The ancients regarded the tongue as a single muscle, the structure of which they did not attempt to unravel. Columbus was the first to consider this organ as composed of two juxtaposed muscles. If the texture of the tongue be examined by means of sections made in different directions, it wiU be found to be composed of an interlacement of muscular fibres, which will, indeed, appear to be inextricable. Among these different sections, I would principally call attention to a vertical section, made at right angles to the axis of the tongue. This section presents a pale muscular tissue in the centre, in which successive layers of vertical and transverse fibres may be distinguished. A soft fatty substance, the lingual adipose tissue, is interposed between these muscular fibres ; it is analogous to the fat formed at » Haller treats of the muscles of the tongue when describing the orgaii of voice (Hb. ix. sect. ii. D 421 1 and of the papillary membrane with the organs of the senses (lib. xm. sect.i. p. 99 ). + The rartilase described by Baur is a fibrous cord, subjacent to the raucous membrane, and occupying the median line on the lower surface of the tongue. It extends from tlic ijpcx of the latter where it is very well marked, to the base, where it termmates in a cellular raphe.THE TONGUE.

ThoughMalpighi*, in amemoir of great interest, had very exactly described and figured the arrangement of the three order^ of fibres in the tongue of the calf; though Steven proved their existence in the human tongue, and Bidloo had carried his observations stiU fui-ther; and although Massa had recommended that to facilitate tms investigation the tongue should be previously boiled, or should be examined after putrefaction had commenced; still almost aU anatomists, including Mailer, neglected this subject, until MM. Baur, Gerdy, and Blandin directed attention to It ahnost at the same time. From the examination of the boiled tongues of the ox, the sheep, and man, I have observed the foUowmg facts : — 1 Under the papillary membrane, which, as I have said before, has aknost the density of cartilage, there is a series of fibres running from before back- wards. These fibres appear to rise in succession from the papillary membrane,, and form a layer, which is thicker in front, where the fibres are coUected into a small space, than it is behind, where they are scattered and pale. In the ox they traverse the yellowish glandular-looking substance found at the base of the tongue. This thin layer is described by Malpighi, and has been called the superior or superficial lingualis muscle :— 2. On the lower surface of the tongue, between the genio-hyo-glossus and the hyo-glossus, we find a longitudinal bundle, reaching from the base to the apex. This thick bundle was first described by Douglas under the name of the lin- gualis muscle; it might be called the inferior lingualis. The lingual muscle of authors generally! is a small muscular fasciculus, situated on the lower surface of the tongue, between the stylo-glossus (u, fig. 143.) and the genio-hyo-glossus (a). It arises from the base of the tongue, in an indistinct manner, amidst an intricate mass of muscular fibres; from thence it passes forwards, and ter- minates at the apex of the tongue, where it unites with the fibres of the stylo- glossus. It shortens the tongue, and depresses its point. 3. On either side of the tongue we find two layers of oblique and very thin fibres, crossing each other. The superficial layer consists of fibres passing forwards and downwards, the deep layer of fibres running obliquely forwards and upwards. These two layers can only be seen towards the base. They are more easily shown in the ox than in man. "We also find along each side some antero-posterior fibres, continuous both with the stylo-glossus and the palato-glossus. 4. Lastly, the dissection of the lingual nucleus of a boiled tongue enables us most distinctly to separate the vertical and transverse fibres already noticed as being seen in the difierent sections of the tongue. The transverse fibres form a slight concavity above ; the vertical fibres converge a little from above down- • It is not unwortiiy of notice, tliat Malpiglii commenced upon tlie tongue tliat series of re- searclies into tlie structure of organs, which has made hira as it were the founder of textural anatomy. t [From this statement Albinus must be excepted; the «aWj of that anatomist corresponds exactly with the muscle described by Douglas.]446 SPJ.ANCHNOL0GY.

TVie Stylo-Ghssus. The *<2/Zo-i,W(„,y?i,..ii4.143.146.) is a smaU, slender muscle, cylindrical above, thm, triangular, and bifid below. It arises trom the styloid process by some tendinous fibres surrounding the lower half of that process, and slightly also from the stylo-maxUlary ligament. The fleshy fibres proceeding from these points form a rounded fasciculus, which passes downwards, inwards and forwards. At the margin of the tongue, oppo- site the anterior pillar of the fauces, the muscle becomes flattened, expanded, and triangular, and di- vides into two parts, —one external, which runs along the corresponding margin of the tongue, from the base to the apex; the other internal, which passes between the two portions of the hyo-glossus, assumes a trans- verse direction, and is blended with the transverse fibres of the tongue. Relations. On the outside it is in relation, successively, with the parotid ' the internal pterygoid muscle, the sublingual gland, the lingual branch 01 tbe faith nerve, and the mucous membrane of the tongue. On the inside it has relations with the stylo-hyoid ligament, the tonsil, the superior constrictor 01 the pharynx, and the hyo-glossus muscle. Action. The stylo-glossus draws the corresponding edge of the tongue, and consequently the entire organ, upwards, and to its own side. When the two stylo-glossi act together, the tongue is increased in breadth, and carried upwards and backwards: it therefore assists in retraction of the tongue. The Hyo-glossus. This is a thin quadrilateral muscle (t,figs. 113, 114. 146.) arising from the OS hyoides by two very distinct origins,—one from the body of the bone, near the great cornu; the other from the whole extent of the anterior border of the great cornu; and also from its point. From this double origin the fleshy fibres pass upwards parallel to each other, forming a quadrilateral muscle, which expands a little in order to terminate upon the sides of the tongue, between the stylo-glossus and the lin- gualis. There is an evident continuity between this muscle and the vertical fasciculi of the tongue. The direction of this muscle varies according to the .positions of the tongue. It is vertical when the organ is contained in the buccal cavity, and is directed obliquely upwards and forwards when the tongue is protruded. The hyo-glossus is almost always divided into two portions corresponding to its double origin, which are separated below by a cellular interval, and above by the posterior fasciculus of the stylo-glossus. Albinus described them as two distinct muscles ; the portion arising from the body of the os hyoides, as the basio-glossits; and under the name of the cerato-glossus, the portion arising from the great cornu. He also admitted a third portion, under the name of the chondro-glossus, described as proceeding from the small cornu. HaUer, who considered this latter fasciculus a distinct muscle, states that he has always been able to find it. Relations. On the outside it is in relation with the stylo-glossus, the mylo-hyoideus, the digastricus, the sublingual gland, the hypo-giosgal nerve,447 THE GENIO-HYO-GLOSSUS. and lingual branch of the fifth. On the inside, it corresponds to the lingual artei-y, which never passes between the two portions of the muscle, to the genio-'hyo-glossus, and to the middle constrictor of the pharyux. Action. It depresses the corresponding edge of the tongue, and draws it towards the os hyoides. When the tongue has been protruded from the mouth, it assists in drawmg it backwards. When the two muscles act together, the tongue is depressed and contracted in its transverse diameter. The Gmio-hyo-glossus. This is the largest of the extrinsic muscles of the tongue: it is thick, triangular, and as it were radiated (a, fig. 143.). It arises from the superior genial process of the inferior maxilla by a sort of tendinous tuft, from which the fleshy fibres immediately proceed as from a centre, radiating backwards in different directions. The posterior fibres are attached to the os hyoides, either directly or through the medium of a membrane. They constitute the superior genio-hyoideus of Ferrein. The more anterior fibres expand upon the sides of the pharynx, occupy the interval between the os hyoides and the stylo-glossus, and immediately cover the corresponding portion of the pharynx, or rather the amygdaloid excavation. These fibres, which are very distinct (I was acquainted with them before I was aware that they had been described by others), constitute the genio-pharyngiens of Winslow. The fibres, which are next in order, proceeding forwards, all belong to the tongue, and traverse the whole length of that organ. The most anterior fibres, which are the shortest of all, having reached the lower surface of the tongue, curve forwards, and terminate near its point. All the others pass perpendicularly upwards and turn a little outwards, so as to terminate in the papillary mucous membrane at the side of the median line. Relations. On the inside it corresponds to its fellow, being separated from it by cellular tissue frequently loaded with fat. The two muscles are perfectly distinct, and separable until they enter the substance of the tongue, beyond which point they cannot be separated from each other. On the outside it is in relation with the sublingual gland, the mylo-hyoideus, hyo-glossus, stylo- glossus, and lingualis muscle. The hypo-glossal nerve perforates this muscle between its genio-pharyngeal and lingual portions. Its lower margin corre- sponds to the genio-hyoideus, from which it is separated by a very delicate layer of cellular tissue. Its upper margin is subjacent to the mucous membrane, of which it occasions a prominence on each side of the frEenum. Action. By its hyoid fibres it raises the os hyoides and carries it forwa.rds ; by its pharyngeal fibres it draws the pharynx forwards and compresses its sides ; by its posterior lingual fibres, as well as the hyoid, it carries the base of the tongue, and consequently the whole organ forwards. This is the muscle by which we are enabled to protrude the tongue from the mouth. By means of its anterior or reflected fibres, the tongue, when protruded, is drawn back into the mouth; lastly, by its median liagual fibres, the tongue is made into a groove ; when one muscle acts alone, it is protruded to the opposite side. Such, including the palato-glossus, already described, are the extrinsic muscles of the tongue: I shall not include among them the mylo-glossus of the older anatomists, and described also by Heister and Winslow, because it ap- pears to be nothing more than that portion of the superior constrictor of the pharynx, which is inserted into the mylo-hyoid ridge; nor yet the glosso- epigloitideus, a veij large muscle existing in the lower animals, which has been described by Albums in the human subject as a dependence of the genio-hyo- glossus. After the most careful examinations I have never been able to meet with it. Vessels, nerves, and cellular tissue. The cellular tissue of the tongue re- ceives arteries and veins, and from it issue both veins and lymphatics.448 SPLANCHNOLOGY. The arteries consist of the proper lingual, which are very large in com- parison to the size of the organ, the palatine, and the inferior pharyngeal. rhe veins form two sets, as in the limbs, and for the same reason—a super- ficial set independent of the arteries, and a deep set accompanvine those •vessels. r j o The lymphatics enter the deep lymphatic glands of the supra-hyoid region. The 7ierves are very large, and are derived from three sources, viz. from the ninth pair or hypo-glossal; from the lingual branch of the fifth pair ; and from the glosso-pharyngeal division of the eighth pair.* The cellular tissue of the tongue is partly serous and partly adipose; the serous portion is chiefly situated in front, the other is more abundant behind. The tegumentary membrane and glands. The tegumentary membrane of the tongue is a continuation of the mucous membrane of the mouth. It is thin and slightly adherent in almost all its non-papillary portion, and becomes very thick and strongly adherent wherever the papillae exist. The edges of the tongue are occupied by numerous small glands, continuous with the sublingual glands, and opening upon the lower wall of the mouth by small excretory ducts. Developement. The tongue is visible in the youngest embryos. Its early developement has reference to its functions, for it is an essential agent in suction, and is consequently brought into use immediately after birth. The tongue is not double or bifid at first; in the earliest embryos it presents the appearance of a single tubercle. Uses of the tongue. The tongue has two very distinct uses. It is the organ of taste, and it is also a moveable organ. In this place we shall consider it in the latter capacity only. The movements of the tongue are concerned in the prehension of food, in suction, in mastication, in tasting, in deglutition, in ar- ticulation, and in playing upon wind-instruments. In order to fulfil such a variety of uses, it is organised so as to be capable of moving in every direction. Its movements are either extrinsic or intrinsic. The extrinsic movements, or those of the whole tongue, may be ascertained from our knowledge of the single or combined actions of its extrinsic muscles. Thus it may be protruded from the mouth, drawn back into that cavity, in- clined to the right or to the left side, directed upwards or downwards, or carried into any intermediate position. In its intrinsic movements it may be con- tracted transversely by the transverse fibres, diminished in length by its lon- gitudinal fibres, and contracted vertically, and rendered concave by its vertical fibres ; lastly, its apex can be carried upwards by the superior, and downwards by the inferior longitudinal fibres. By far the most varied, precise, and rapid motions of this organ are required in the articulation of sounds, in which it is one of the chief agents. In con- sequence of this use, which is by no means the result of a special conformation (for by constant practice, animals, whose tongues are very different from ours, may be taught to articulate), the tongue is associated with, and becomes one of the principal instruments of the mind. It is the organ by which thought is most commonly expressed. This use is peculiar to man. * The ninth nerve is distributed to the muscles, the lingual nerve to the mucous membrane of the anterior part and sides, and the glosso-pharyngeal to that of the base of the tongue. (See Organ of Taste.) . . . ^ T have lately seen a considerable branch of the facial nerve termmating m the tongue ; it was "iven off from the facial nerve at its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen, crossed obliquely in front of the styloid process with which it was in contact, passed in front of the stylo-pharyngeus muscle externally to the tonsil, and parallel to the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which was situ- ated behind it, communicated with that nerve by several arches, and divided into two branches at the base of the tongue, one of which ran along the edge of that organ, and the other anas- tomosed by a loop with the glosso-pharyngeal: from this loop some filaments passed off, to be distributed in the usual manner. The opposite side did not exhibit a corresponding arrangement.449 THE PAROTID GLAND The Salivary Glands. ^hich by most anatomists ^l^J^^J^^^^ ^^^^^ypartic glandular apparatus, parous crypts, there exists svmmScllly exteiided\long the rami and forming a sort of cham ^^^^^tn upted so as to form six glandular ^iLftt^o^SVn'reS^ and sub-lingual glands.* The Parotid Gland. The parotid gland {p,fig. 144.), so called from being situated below and in ine paroua giaau jy ^^^^^ ^^^^^ external auditory meatus Qrrapa, near, ods, iiros, the ear), fills the parotid ex- cavation. It is bounded in front by the 144. pogtgrioj. edge of the ramus of the lower ^ jaw ; behind, by the external auditory me- atus and the mastoid process; above, by the zygomatic arch; below, by the angle of the lower jaw ; and on the inside, by the styloid process and the muscles which pro- ceed from it. This gland has given its name to the region occupied by it. It is the largest of all the salivary glands, and even exceeds all the rest put together. Its foi-m is irregular, and is determined by that of the surrounding parts, upon which it is moulded like a piece of soft wax. Its superficial portion is broad, but it suddenly becomes contracted when it dips behind the ramus of the jaw. In order to obtain a good idea of the size and shape of this gland, it must be removed entire from the irregular mould in which it is lodged. It has been compared to a pyramid, of which the base is directed outwards, and the apex inwards. Relations. Its external surface, or base, is broad, oblong from above down- wards, irregularly quadrilateral, and lobulated at the edges; it is subcuta.neous, being separated from the skin, however, by the parotid fascia and the risorius of Santorini, when that muscle exists, f Its anterior surface is grooved so as to embrace the posterior edge of the ramus of the lower jaw. A bursa, or some loose cellular tissue facilitates the movements of these parts. This surface is also in relation with the internal pterygoid muscle, the stylo-maxillary ligament, and the masseter muscle, on the external surface of which it is prolonged to a greater or less extent (see fg. 144.) in diflferent individuals, and is separated from it anteriorly by the ramifications of the facial nerve, by some loose cellular tissue, and by the transverse artery of the face. Its posterior surface is in relation with the cartilaginous portion of the ex- ternal auditory canal, being moulded upon its convexity, and. adhering to it by very dense cellular tissue: it corresponds also to the mastoid process, the stemo-cleido-mastoid and digastric muscles, and indirectly to the transverse process of the atlas. This surface is extremely irregular, adheres by means * The continuity of this glandular chain, admitted by some anatomists, is only apparent. A fibrous septum always intervenes between the sub-maxillary and the parotid glands. t In a female in whom I dissected the parotid gland, the risorius arose from the superior semicircular line of the occipital bono by two distinct fasciculi, which, passing downwardsand forwards, united opposite the apex of the mastoid process, and then proceeding horizontally, expanded upon the parotid gland. Some of the fibres reached the commissure of the lips, but the greater number were lost upon the parotid fascia. VOL. I.

On the itiside it is reduced to a mere border, -which corresponds to the styloid process, and the muscles and ligament connected with it. It sends off a con- siderable prolongation into the space which separates the styloid process and its muscles from the internal pterygoid ; but the most important relation of this border is with the external carotid artery, for which it furnishes a groove and sometimes even a complete canal. Its upper extremity corresponds to the zygomatic arch and the temporo-max- illary articulation. Its lower extremity fA\s up the interval between the angle of the jaw and the sterno-mastoid, and is separated from the sub-maxiUary gland (m) by a very thick fibrous septum. Besides the relations already indicated, the parotid has others with the ves- sels and nerves which traverse it at different depths : these may be called its intrinsic or deep relations. Thus the external carotid artery almost always perforates the gland near its inner side ; the temporal artery (see fig. 144.), the transversalis faciei, and the anterior auricular, which commence in the sub- stance of the gland, also traverse it in various directions. We also find within it the temporal vein, which is a communicating branch between the external and internal jugulars; the tmnk of the facial nerve is at first placed behind the gland, then penetrates it, and divides into two or three branches, which again subdivide and traverse it in all directions. The auricular nerve, a branch of the cervical plexus, also passes through it very superficially.* The parotid gland, by a remarkable exception, always contains in its substance, a little below the surface, several lymphatic glands, which may be readily distin- guished by their red colour from the proper tissue of the gland. It may be imagined that a morbid developement of these glands may have often been mistaken for disease of the parotid itself. Structure. A thick fibrous membrane covers the parotid glands, and sends prolongations into it which divide it into lobes, and these again into glandular lobules. The actual structure of the gland, therefore, depends upon the nature of these lobules; and without entering into details which belong more properly to general anatomy, it may be stated that it has been shown, by the aid of the simple microscope, that each lobule is a porous spongy body, some- thing like the pith of the rush, and provided with afferent vessels, viz. the arteries; and efferent vessels, i. e. the veins and excretory ducts, f The relations of the nerves and lymphatic vessels with these granules have not been accu- rately determined. The parotid arteries are very numerous : some of them arise directly from the external carotid; others from its branches, more particularly from the superficial temporal, the transversalis faciei, and the anterior and posterior auricular. The veins have similar names, and follow the same direction as the arteries. There is a parotid venous plexus. * These relations prove the almost absolute impossibility of cx- P' M!^ ./ia tirpating this gland by a cutting instrument, and of comjiression I'lg.

See MUllcr's Physiology, translated by Baly, p. 447., and MiiUer on the Glands, translated by Solly, p. 69—(Tr.) In the early embryo of the sheep, this gland consists of a canal which opens into the mouth by one extremity, but is closed at the otlier, and has nnmerous short hollow branches projecting from it into a granular blastema ; as developement advances, the blastema is absorbed, and the ramified canal, increasing in length, becomes still more ramified, so as to form the ducts with their closed vesicular iMayniiUil lifty limes. terminations.]THE PAROTID GLAND. 451 The lymphatic vessels are little known : they terminate partly in the glands at the angle of the jaw, and partly in those which lie in front of the auditory meatus. I have already said that one or more lymphatic glands are alwa_y s situated in the parotid gland, a few lines below its surface. The nerves are derived from the anterior auricular (a branch of the cervical plexus) and from the facial nerve : they seem to be lost in the substance of the gland. The parotid duct. A small excretory duct (resulting from the union of its terminating vesicles) proceeds from each lobule, and unites almost immediately, at a very acute angle, with the ducts of the adjacent lobules. From the suc- cessive union of all these ducts a single canal results, which emerges from about the middle of the anterior margin of the gland: this is the parotid duct (s,fig. 144.), called also the duct of Steno, although it had been previously de- scribed by Casserius. It passes horizontally forwards, about five or six lines beneath the zygomatic arch, across the masseter, and at right angles to its fibres. At the anterior border of the masseter it changes its direction, curves in front of a mass of fat situated there, dips perpendicularly into the fat of the cheek, perforates the buccinator in the same direction, and glides obliquely, for the space of several lines, between that muscle and the mucous membrane of the mouth, which it pierces opposite the interval between the first and the second upper great molar teeth, almost on a level with the middle of their crown. The mode in which the Stenonian duct opens into the buccal cavity does not appear to me to have been sufficiently well understood. It exactly resembles the manner in which the ureters enter the bladder. Thus it glides obliquely for a certain distance beneath the mucous membrane, a fact that may be easily determined by perforating the cheek at the point where the duct passes through the buccinator, and then measuring the interval between this perfo- ration and the buccal orifice of the canal: this interval varies from two to three lines in extent. Again, the buccal orifice is oblique, like the vesical opening of the ureter, so that it is extremely easy to pass a fine probe into it. The duct of Steno is often accompanied by an accessory gland* (glandula socia parotidis, see;?^'. 144.) situated between it and the zygomatic arch. The duct of this little gland opens into the main canal. I have seen two small accessory glands situated above the canal, one at the middle and the other at the ante- rior part of the masseter. Lastly, as the parotid duct is passing through the buccinator, it is surrounded by a series of glands continuous with those of the cheeks, called violar glands, the ducts of some of which appear to open into the canal, and those of others directly into the mouth. Although it is not flexu- ous, the canal when separated from the surrounding parts will be found much longer than it appears at first sight. Relations. The Stenonian duct is subcutaneous and superficial where it passes over the masseter; it is protected by a large quantity of fat, and in tront of the masseter by the zygomaticus major. A considerable branch of the facial nerve, and some arteries derived from the transversaUs faciei, run along this canal. Structure. An exaggerated idea is generally enteitained of the thickness ot the duct of Steno; it is only thick at its anterior part, where it is strength- ened by an expansion of the aponeurosis of the buccinator muscle. When treed from the surrounding fat it is not thicker than most other ducts, the ureters for example. The notion that it is inextensible is also incorrect. It IS true, however that the diameter of its canal is not in proportion to the size ot me gland. It is formed by two membranes,—one external, the nature of which IS not well known; the other internal, consisting of a prolongation of the mucous membrane of the mouth. Its arteries and veins are very large. • atroJ?,ied"" '""""'^ ^^""'^ ^'^''^ "^^^^ ^"''J'"^' ^"ere the corresponding parotid was462 SPLANCHNOLOGY, The Suh-maxillary Gland. The sub-maxillary gland (m,fiff. 144.) is situated in the supra-hyoid region, and partly behind the body of the lower jaw : it is bounded by the reflected tendon of the digastricus, below which it almost always projects. Size and figure. It is much smaller than the parotid, but larger than the sub-lingual. It is oblong from before backwards, elliptical, irregular, and di- vided into two or three lobes by some deep fissm-es. Relations. On the outside and helow it corresponds to a depression on the inferior maxillary bone, in which it is completely lodged when the jaw is depressed. When, on the other hand, the head is bent backwards upon the neck, the gland appears almost entirely in the supra-hyoid region, and is in relation with the platysma, being separated from it by the cervical fascia, to which it is imited by cellular tissue of so loose a texture, that it may be called a synovial bursa. This surface of the gland is also in relation with the in- ternal pterygoid muscle and the numerous lymphatic glands situated along the base of the jaw. On the inside and above, it corresponds to the digastric, mylo-hyoid, and hyo-glossus muscles, and to the hypo-glossal and lingual nerves. The sub-maxillary gland almost always forms a prolongation of variable size and shape above the mylo-hyoideus. Sometimes the lobules of which it is composed are situated in lines, so as to appear like the Whartonian duct, or rather a second canal running parallel to it Most commonly this prolongation is of considerable size and irregular, and forms, as it were, a second sub-max- illary gland. . , . . , ^ ^ I.- u The most important relation of the gland is to the facial artery (a), wbicli runs in a groove on its posterior border, and upon the contiguous part of its ex- ternal surface. Sometimes this groove is prolonged forwards, and divides the gland into two unequal parts. We cannot avoid seeing the great analogy between this arrangement and that of the external carotid artery, with regard to the parotid gland. ., t ■ Structure This is identical with that of the parotid. Its investing fibrous membrane is weaker, and still more difficult of demonstration. The arteries are numerous, and arise from the facial and the lingual. The veins correspond to them. The lymphatic vessels are Uttle known, and enter the neighbouring glands The nerves are derived from the lingual and the myloid branch of the dental. I should remark that all the nerves proceeding from the sub- maxillary ganglion are destined for this gland. . , . The excretory duct of the sub-maxillary gland is called the Whartonian duct, although it was reaUy discovered by Van Home. It is formed by the suc- cessive union of all the small ducts proceeding from the lobules; it leaves the eland at the upper bifurcation of its anterior extremity, and consequently above the mylo-hvoideus, and is directed obliquely upwards and inwards, parallel to to the great hypo-glossal and lingual nerves. It is at first placed between the mylo-hyoid and hyo-glossus muscles, and then glides between the genio- hyo--lossus and the sub-Ungual gland, to the inner surface of which it is attached * I have never succeeded in determming whether it receives anj ex- cretory duct or ducts from this gland. Having reached the side of the fraenum Wu J the duct, which is sub-mucous in the whole of the portion corresponding to Ewrnguar gland, changes its direction, passes forwards and opens by an extremely narrow orifice upon the summit of a promment and moveable mnma f^und behind the incisor teeth.

The Sub-lingual Gland. The sub-lingualgland) I, Jig. 146.), which may be regarded as an agglomeration of smaller glands analogous to those of the _^Fig. 146. palate, is situated in the sub-lingual fossa of the lower jaw, at the side of the symphysis menti: it is much smaller than the preceding gland, with which it is sometimes continuous. Its shape is oblong, like that of an olive flattened at the sides. The following are its relations:—It is subjacent to the mu- cous membrane, beneath which its upper edge forms a prominent ridge, running from before backwards along the sides of the frsenum; its lower edge rests upon the mylo-hyoid muscle; its external surface corresponds, partly to the mucous membrane and partly to the sub- lingual fossa; its internal surface is in rela- tion with the mucous membrane, with the genio-hyo-glossus (from which it is separated by the lingual nerve), with the Whartonian duct (which we have seen closely adheres to it), and with the ranine vein. Its anterior extremity touches the gland of the opposite side. Its posterior extremity and its lower edge are embraced by the lingua,l nerve, which gives numerous filaments to it. A small glandular prolongation also proceeds from its posterior extremity, and runs along the edge of the tongue. Structure. Precisely similar to that of the other salivary glands. Its arteries arise from the sub-mental and sub-lingual. Its veins bear the same name. Its nerves are numerous, and are derived from the lingual. Its excretory ducts, called also the ducts of Jtivinus from their discoverer, are seven or eight in number. They open along the sub-lingual crest: their ori- fices may be shown by placing a coloui'ed fluid in the mouth. Most ana- tomists state, that several of the ducts of this gland open into the Whartonian duct. 1^1 General characters of the salivary glands. The salivary glands present the following general characters : — 1. They are situated around the lower jaw, extending along its body and rami, from the condyles to the symphysis ; they are in relation on the one hand with the maxillary bone, and on the other with numerous muscles, so that they are subjected to considerable compression during the movements of the lower jaw. 2. They all have direct relations with large arteries, which com- municate their pulsations to them. 3. They receive vessels from a great number of points, and the vessels themselves are very numerous. 4. They are penetrated by many of the cerebro-spinal nerves, of which some only pass through, but a certain number terminate in them. 5. In structure they re- semble the pancreas and the lachrymal glands ; they have no special fibrous investment to isolate them completely from the surrounding parts; they have no precise form, and they are subdivided into lobes and lobules. 6. Their • This was observed in a shoemaker ; the bristle had become' the nucleus of a salivary c.il. cuius. 'SPLANCHNOLOGY. excretory ducts pour their secretion into the mouth, i. e. the parotids hetween the cheeks and the teeth, the sab-maxillary and the suh-lingual glands behind the lower incisors on each side of the apex of the tongue. This distribution of the means of insalivation between the two cavities into -which the mouth is divided, deserves the attention of physiologists. The Buccal Mucous Membrane. The buccal mucous membrane is continuous with the skin at the free edges of the lips ; it lines their posterior surface, and is reflected from them upon each of the maxillary bones forming a cul-de-sac or trench, and in the median line a small fold called the frsenum of the lips. About a line and a half, or two lines, fi-om the free border of the lips, it changes its character and constitutes the gums, which are reflected upon themselves so as to become continuous with the fibro-mucous membrane, called the alveolo-dental periosteum. In the lower jaw the mucous membrane passes from the alveolar border to the lower wall of the mouth, and from it to the under surface of the tongue. At the point of reflection Ln the median line, it forms the frsenum lingua;. From the under surface of the tongue, the mucous membrane passes over its edges and upper surface, where it presents the peculiarities already described ; and in being reflected from the base of the tongue to the epiglottis it forms three folds, the glosso-epiglottid, so as to become continuous on the one hand with the mucous membrane of the larynx, and on the other with that of the pharynx. In the upper jaw it is extended from the upper alveolar border upon the roof of the palate, passing over the anterior and posterior palatine canals, which it closes but does not enter. From the roof of the palate it passes upon the velum, and is continuous with the nasal mucous membrane at its free edge. On the sides it forms two large folds for the pillars of the fauces, lines the amygdaloid excavation, covers the tonsil, and becomes continuous with the mucous membrane of the base of the tongue and of the pharynx. At the sides of the buccal cavity the mucous membrane is reflected from both the alveolar borders upon the inner surface of the cheeks, and thus foi-ms two trenches. At the anterior edge of the ramus of the jaw, behind the molar teeth, it is elevated by a salivary gland which marks the limit between the cheeks and the pillars of the fences. Inside this prominence it forms a cul-de- sac. The buccal mucous membrane sends off prolongations into the numerous canals which open into the mouth. Thus on the floor of the mouth there are two for the Whartonian ducts and several for the small ducts of the sub-lingual glands. Two others are seen on the inner sides of the cheeks for the ducts of Steno ; and it is also clear that it must penetrate into the thousands of other orifices with which the mouth is studded (those of the buccal, labial, palatine, and other glands). But in all these prolongations its structure is modified, and it becomes exceedingly thin. It has been proved that it lines not only the larger ducts, but even their minutest subdivisions. Thus there is a kind of parotitis which consists in inflammation of the lining membrane of the ex- cretory ducts of that gland; and then all the canals are filled with muco- puriform secretion, which escapes by the buccal orifice when the gland is com- pressed. The numerous openings on the surface of the tonsil are formed by the prolongations of this membrane into the cavities situated in its interior. Although the different parts of the buccal mucous membrane are continuous, they do not all possess the same characters. Compare for instance, in regard to their density, thickness, and closeness of adhesion to the subjacent tissues, the mucous membrane of the gums and palate with that of the bps and cheeks, or the membrane covering the lower with that upon the upper surface of the tongue, or the mucous membrane of the free edge of the velum palati with that of the arches and the amygdaloid excavation.THE PHARYNX. 455 G G 4 The two principal charactei's of the buccal mucous membrane are the follow- ing : 1. The presence of an epidermis or epithelium* (as it is called in mucous membranes). This can be distinctly demonstrated by maceration, or by the action of boiling water or some acid ; by any of these means a pellicle is raised having all the characters of an epidermis. It is very thick upon the gums, the roof of the palate, and upon the tongue, where it forms a horny sheath to each papilla. To the existence of this membrane, and of the fluid with which it is constantly kept moist, we must attribute the possibility of applying, or rather running, a red hot iron over the surface of the tongue without burning the part. 2. The multiplicity of small subjacent glands so near to each other in some parts as to form a continuous layer. These glands should be carefully distinguished from the muciparous follicles or crypts, with which many modern anatomists have commonly confounded them. To these two characteristics a third may be added, peculiar to some portions of the buccal mucous membrane, viz. that it is supported by a very dense fibrous tissue, with which it is completely united. This fibrous layer is perfectly distinct from the periosteum, and from its presence the mucous membrane should be arranged among the fibro-miicous membranes. The Pharynx. The pharynx ((pdpvy^, the throatf ; 1, 2, 3, fig. 140.), long confounded with the CBSophagus under the common name of gula or oesophagus, is a muscular and membranous semi-canal, perfectly symmetrical, and situated in the median line: it is a sort of vestibule, common to the digestive and the respiratory passages, intermediate between the buccal and nasal cavities on the one hand, and between the oesophagus and larynx on the other. It is situated deeply in front of the vertebral column, extending from the basilar process of the occi- pital bone to opposite the fourth or fifth cervical vertebra and the cricoid cartilage. It therefore corresponds to the parotid, and partly to the supra- hyoid regions. Its dimensions deserve particular attention. It is smaller than the mouth, but larger than the oesophagus, which, compared to it, resembles the tube of a funnel. Hence it follows, that foreign bodies which have been able to pass along the mouth and pharynx, may be arrested in the oesophagus. In length it is from 4 to 4^ inches, which may be increased to 5^ or even 6^ by distension, and reduced to 2| by the greatest possible contraction, which is limited only by the contact of the base of the tongue with the velum palati rendered horizontal. The length of the pharynx, therefore, may be made to vary about 4 inches. The pharynx undergoes these extreme variations both in deglutition and in modulating the voice; in effecting which latter purpose it acts in the same way as the tube of a clarionet or flute. Thus considered, the entire length of the pharynx maybe divided into three parts—a nasal (1,^^. 140.), a buccal or guttural (2), and a laryngeal (3) portion. It may be easily seen that the variations m length afi"ect almost exclusively the buccal portion, into which the air IS received after escaping from the larynx. Now these variations in the length of the pharynx have the same influence over the compass of the human voice, as the differences in the lengths of the tubes of wind-instruments have upon the sounds produced by them. The breadth of the upper or nasal portion of the pharynx is measured by the interval between the posterior margins of the internal pterygoid plates • it IS about one inch, and is invariable. In the buccal portion the same diameter IS measured by the interval between the posterior extremities of the alveolar borders, and is about two inches : it may be diminished to one inch by the caviij'rorthe^^ "~ membranes ; that of the buecal t The term pharynx had no well defined meaning among the ancients : they sometime. „.»h It to designate the pharynx, properly so called ; sometimes the larynx. " used456 SPLANCHNOLOGY. contraction of the constrictor muscles. The breadth of the laryngeal portion is measured, first, by the interval between the summits of the great cornua of the OS liyoides, where it is about one inch and near two lines ; then by the interval between the superior cornua of the thyroid cartilage, which is an inch and two or three lines; and lastly by the interval between the inferior cornua of the same cartilage, about eleven or twelve lines. The contraction of this laryngeal portion may be carried to complete obliteration of the cavity. Both the buccal and laryngeal portions, therefore, are capable of contraction, and this always takes place in deglutition, in order to force down and compress the alimentary mass. Contraction of the buccal portion also takes place in the modulation of sounds : it exerts the same influence over the compass of the human voice as the contraction of the tubes of the flute or clarionet does over the notes of those instruments. The antero-posterior dimensions of the pharynx are not subject to the same variations as the transverse and vertical, on account of the presence of the vertebral column. Its enlargement in this direction is produced during that period in the act of deglutition when the larynx and os hyoides are carried forwards and upwards, and its diminution at the time when the same parts are carried upwards and backwards. The antero-posterior diameter of the pha- rynx depends upon the length of the basilar process of the occipital bone. Figure. The pharynx does not form a complete cavity with distinct and separate walls, but rather half or two thirds of a canal, which is completed in part by several organs otherwise not belonging to it. Moreover the pharynx, from its commencement down to the larynx, is habitually open, and in a state of tension ; its walls are never in apposition—an important circumstance in re- ference to the continual passage of air through its nasal and buccal portions. This -tension depends on its attachment to the basilar process, and to the fixed points at its sides, and also upon the tendinous structure of its upper portion. Opposite the larynx, the tension ceases to exist. The pharynx, as well as all other hollow organs, presents an external and an internal surface. The external surface. This is in relation behind by a plane surface with the vertebral column (see fig. 140.), from which it is separated by the long muscles of the neck and the anterior recti of the head. It glides by means of some very loose cellular tissue upon the fascia covering the muscles of that region ; and when from the effect of inflammation this cellular tissue becomes dense, the movements of deglutition cannot be performed, and dysphagia is the result. The relation of the pharynx to the vertebral column accounts for congestive abscesses of the neck sometimes opening into the pharynx. At the sides the pharynx is separated from the internal pterygoid muscle by a triangular space,' broad below and narrow above, occupied by the internal carotid artery, the interaal jugular vein, and the pneumogastric, glosso-pha- ryngeal, hypo-glossal, and spinal accessory nerves, all being surrounded by very loose cellular tissue. The sides of the pharynx are also indirectly in relation with the parotid gland and the styloid muscles. Lower down, the pharynx corresponds to a great number of lymphatic glands, and to the external caro- tid artery and its branches. _ _ The internal surface. In order to examine this surface it is necessary to open the pharynx from behind by a vertical incision. We shall then perceive that this structure only exists behind and at the sides, but that in front it pre- sents agreat number of openings {see figs. 140,141.), the arrangement of which is of great interest. „ , , Proceeding from above downwards, we find 1. the two posterior openings of the nasal fossse (1), quadrilateral in form, having their longest diameter vertical, and separated from each other by the posterior edge of the septum. On looking into them we see the posterior extremities of the turbinated bones and the terminations of the several meatuses. 2. The upper surface of the velum palati (c a), forming an inclined plane, which directs the mucous secretionsTHE PHARYNX. 457 into the throat. 3.

The posterior smface of larynx with its two lateral and triangular grooves, broad above and narrow below, which have been regarded as specially intended for the swallowmg of liquids, which thus pass on each side of the laryngeal opening. It is extremely curious and highly important to study aU the objects dis- played in the complicated mechanism of the pharynx: by so doing we learn how the air passes from the nasal fossa and mouth into the pharynx, and thence into the larynx, into which it is drawn by the active expansion of the thorax, without ever entering the a?sophagus; how the mucous secretions of the nose, or blood, can pass from the nose down into the mouth and throat; how instru- ments may be introduced from the nasal fossae and buccal cavity into the oesophagus and larynx, or drawn from the nose into the mouth ; and lastly, how solids and liquids can pass into the oesophagus without entering the air- passages, or why they sometimes take this irregular course. The posterior wall of the pharynx is broader in the buccal region than either above or below: it may be partially seen through the isthmus of the fauces in the living subject. There is no folding of the membrane upon any part of this wall, we only find a few glands forming projections beneath the lining mem- brane. On each lateral wall is seen the expanded orifice of the corresponding Eusta- chian tube {4:, fig. 140.), and a groove leading from it downwards and inwards. This orifice corresponds precisely to the posterior extremity of the lower tur- binated bone ; an important relation, because it serves as a guide in the now common operation of introducing a catheter into the Eustachian tube. The roof of the pharjux corresponds to the basilar process : it may be reached by the finger introduced into the mouth, if it be curved directly upwards. There is no very distinct line of demarcation, either internally or exter- nally, between the pharynx and the oesophagus {y,fig. 140.). Their limits are established by a sudden narrowing of the tube *, by a change of colour in the lining membrane, and by a change in the direction and colour of the mus- cular fibres, which are red in the pharynx and much paler in the oesophagus. Structure of the pharynx. The pharynx is composed of an aponeurotic por- tion, of muscles, of vessels and nerves, and of a lining mucous membrane. The aponeurotic portion, or framework, of the pharynx is composed of the cephalo-pharyngeal aponeurosis and of the petro-pharyngeal aponeurosis. The cephalo-pharyngeal or posterior aponeurosis of the pharynx arises from the lower surface of the basilar process, from the Eustachian tubes, and from the contiguous parts of the petrous portions of each temporal bone: it is con- tinuous above with the thick periosteum, which covers the basilar process; is prolonged vertically downwards, and, gradually diminishing in thickness, is lost after extending about an inch and a half or two inches. On this membrane the constrictor muscles of the pharynx terminate. The petro-pharyngeal or lateral aponeurosis of the pharynx arises from the petrous portion of the temporal bone internally to the inferior orifice of the carotid canal, by a very thick tendinous bundle, continuous at a right angle with the cephalo-pharyngeal aponeurosis t; it then descends along the sides of the pharynx, and splits into bundles, which are inserted into the pterygoid fossa between the internal pterygoid muscle and the circumflexus palati, sepa- rating these muscles from each other. From thence it gives off to the posterior * [This occurs exactly opposite the cricoid cartilage.] t The superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic nerve lies upon the angle formed by these two aponeuroses.^'^o SPLANCHNOLOGY. extremity of the inferior alveolar border a fibrous prolongation, to the front of which the buccinator muscle is attached. This aponeurosis covers the tonsil, to which it is closely united. It is prolonged downwards as far as the upper border of the os hyoides, in order to form the framework of the side and lower part of the pharynx. Muscles of the Pharynx- The muscles of the pharynx are divided into intrinsic and extrinsic. The Intrinsic Muscles. The intrinsic muscles have a membranous form, and are arranged in three successive imbricated layers. Santorini described a great many muscles in the pharynx, on account of their numerous attachments ; but Albinus has reduced them to three on each side, named constrictors, distinguished into an inferior, a middle, and a superior. Chaussier united all the muscles which enter into the composition of the pharynx, under the collective name of les stylo-pharyngiens. The division of Albinus has been generally and justly preferred. The Inferior Constrictor. This is a membranous muscle (w,figs. 141.147.) of a lozenge or rather a Fig. 147. trapezoid shape, the most superficial and the thickest of all the muscles of the pharynx, and is situated at the lower part of that cavity. It is attached, on the one hand, to the cricoid and the thyroid cartUages ; and, on the other, to the fibro-eeUular raphe along the posterior median line of the pharynx (crico-phai-yn- gien and thyro-pharyngien, Valsalva, Winslow, and Santorini). It might be called the crico-thyro-pha- ryngeus. It arises upon the side of the cricoid car- tilage, from a triangular space bounded in front by the crico-thyroideus (a, fig. 147.), from which it often receives some fibres, and behind by the crico-aryte- noideus posticus (i, fig.XiX.'). Its thyroid origins are much more extensive, and take place from an imaginary oblique line on the outer surface of that cartilage, from the two tubercles at the extremities of that line, and from the entire surface behind it; also from the upper and posterior bor- ders, and from the corresponding inferior cornu of the same cartilage. Having thus arisen by two very distinct digitations, the fleshy fibres pass in different directions : the inferior fibres, short and horizontal, proceed directly inwards; the superior become longer, and are directed more obliquely upwards, in pro- portion as they approach the upper part of the muscle: they terminate by an expanded border of much greater extent than the outer border, and the upper extremity of which rarely extends above the middle of the pharynx. The transverse direction and the shortness of the inferior fibres have obtained for them the name of the oesophageal muscle ( Winslow, Santorini). Relations. Covered by a dense cellular membrane which surrounds the entire pharynx, and which might be regarded as the proper sheath of its muscles, the inferior constrictor has the same relations posteriorly as the pharynx itself. Externally it is covered by the sterno-thyroid muscle and the thyroid body. It covers the middle constrictor, the stylo-phai-yngeus, and palato-pharyngeus, and for a great part of its extent it is in contact with the mucous membrane of the pharynx (see figs. 141. 147.). The recurrent laryngeal nerve passes under the lower margin of this muscle, near its cricoid attachment, in order to enter the larynx. Its upper margin is well defined from the other constrictors by a tolerably distinct ridge, and by the passage of the superior laryngeal nerve beneath it. Winslow states that he has seen some fibres of the muscle arise from the thyroid body ; and Morgagni, that he has traced some from the first ring of the trachea.MUSCLES OF THE PHARYNX. 459 Action. It is simply a constrictor in its lower portion : its upper fibres act as a constrictor, a depressor, and a tensor of the posterior wall of the pharynx; it can also raise the larynx and carry it backwards. The Middle Constrictor. This is a membranous triangular muscle (v,figs. 141. 147.) situated in the middle of the pharynx, upon a plane anterior to the preceding. It arises from the oshyoides, and is inserted into the posterior median raphe (hio-pharynqeus). It arises from the os hyoides inthe following manner:—1. trom the whole extent of the upper surface of the great cornu below the hyo-glossus (0, from which it is separated by the lingual artery ; a great many fibres arise by a tendinous origin from the apex of this cornu; 2. from the lesser cornu and the contiguous part of the stylo hyoid ligament. From these different origins, which form the external truncated angle of the muscle, the fleshy fibres diverge in various directions; the inferior passing downwards, the middle transversely, and the superior upwards: the latter are much more oblique and more numerous than the others, and terminate in a pointed extremity, which never reaches as high as the basilar process. Relations. Its external surface is in a great measure superficial, and is in relation with the muscles of the prs-vertebral region, through the inedium of the cellular investment of the pharynx. It is covered, in the rest of its extent, by the inferior constrictor and the hyo-glossus. It covers the mucous mem- brane of the pharynx, the superior constrictor, the stylo-pharyngeus, and the palato-pharyngeus. Its upper margin may be distinguished from the superior constrictor by its projecting slightly behind that muscle, and by the stylo- pharyngeus (r), which lifts up this border in penetrating into the pharynx. Action. It is a constrictor of the pharynx, and can draw the os hyoides upwards and backwards. The Superior Constrictor. This is a quadrilateral muscle (g,figs. 141. 147.) occupying the upper part of the pharynx: it arises from the pterygoid process, the mylo-hyoid ridge, and the base of the tongue ; and is inserted into the posterior median raphe, (jpterygo-pharyngeus, buccinato-pharyngeus, mylo-pharyngeus, and glosso-pharyn- geus, Santorini). It arises, 1. by tendinous fibres, from the lower third of the margin of the internal pterygoid plate and its hamular process ; 2. from the contiguous por- tion of the palate bone, and the reflected tendon of the circumflexus palati; 3. from the buccinato-pharyngeal aponeurosis, which extends from the ptery- goid process to the posterior extremity of the inferior alveolar arch * ; 4. from the posterior extremity of the mylo-hyoid line ; 5. the fibres which are said to arise from the base of the tongue are nothing more than those fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus, which Winslow has described as le genio-pharyngieru These are the same fibres, so difficult to demonstrate, which Valsalva and Santorini have regarded as forming a particular muscle, denominated by them the glosso-pharyngeus. From these different origins the fleshy fibres curve backwards, and then pass transversely inwards ; the superior form a sort of arch, having its con- cavity directed upwards {see figs. 141.147.), and are inserted into the cephalo- pharyngeal aponeurosis: they fonathecephalo-pharyngeus muscle of some authors, which is said to be continued from one side to the other without any inter- mediate raphe. This muscle forms a very thin layer, the fibres of which are paler and less distinct than those of the other constrictors. Relations. Its external surface is partly covered by the preceding muscle, and has behind, and on the sides, the same relations as the phaiynx. This * As this same aponeurosis gives attachment to the buccinator, it may be conceived tliat the contraction of that muscle cannot be altogether without effect upon the pharynx.SPLANCHNOLOGY. muscle forms the inner side of a triangular space already described (p. 456 ) (.tne muxillo-pharyngeal), the outer side of which is formed by the ramus of the lower jaw and the internal pterygoid muscle (6, fig. 141.), and which is oc- cupied by the internal carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, and the pneu- mogastric, hypo-glossal and spinal accessory nerves. Its internal surface {fig. 141.) is in relation with the pharyngeal mucous membrane, with the levator palati (c), which it separates from the circum- flexus palati (rf), and with the palato-pharyngeus (e). Action. It is a constrictor. Remarks. From the preceding description it follows, 1. That the constric- tors of the pharynx form three super-imposed or rather imbricated muscular layers. This imbrication, or overlapping, is so arranged, that the projections (very slight it is true) formed by the upper margins of the constrictors are on the outer not on the inner surface of the pharynx; and this has perhaps some relation to the downward course of the alimentary mass.* 2. That the thickest part of the muscular layer formed by the constrictors is opposite the buccal portion of the pharynx, where the lower and middle constrictors overlap ; and that the thinnest part is in the nasal portion, which is formed by the superior constrictor alone. 3. That the pharyngeal insertions of all the constrictors are upon a single line, the median raphe, whilst their points of origin are exceed- ingly numerous, viz., commencing from below, the cricoid cartilage, the thy- roid cartilage, the great and lesser cornua of the os hyoides, the base of the the tongue, the mylo-hyoid line, the buccinato-pharyngeal aponeurosis, and lastly the pterygoid process. The Extrinsic Muscles, The extrinsic muscles of the pharynx are generally two in number, the stylo-pharyngeus and the palato-pharyngeus. The latter has been already described among the muscles of the velum palati. It is by no means un- common to find several supernumerary muscles. The Stylo-pharyngeus. This muscle (r,figs. 143. 147.), which is round above and broad and thin below, arises by tendinous and fleshy fibres from the inner side of the base of the styloid process, or rather from the vaginal process suiTounding that base. From this point it passes downwards and inwards, becomes wider and flattened as it enters the pharynx between the middle and superior constrictors, to spread out beneath the mucous membrane. Its upper fibres ascend, the middle are transverse, and the lower fibres descend to terminate along the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage f (see fig. 143.). These fibres, together with those of the palato-pharyngeus, form the fourth muscular layer of the pharynx. Rela tions. Before entering the pharynx, the stylo-pharyngeus is in relation on the outside with the stylo-glossus muscle (a), the external carotid artery, and the parotid gland; on the inside with the internal carotid and the internal jugular vein. Its most interesting relation is with the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which runs along its outer side. Some branches of the nerve often pass through it. In the pharynx it is covered by the middle constrictor, and it lies outside the superior constrictor, the palato-pharyngeus, and the mucous membrane. Action. It raises the larynx and the pharynx. Supernumerary Muscles of the Pharynx. Among the supernumerary extrinsic muscles of the pharynx, I shall notice 1. a fasciculus pointed out by Albinus, which I have often met with : it arises * In the construction of pipes or tunnels for the conveyance of water, &c. each piece is re- ceived into that below it; an opposite arrangement would facilitate the blocking up of the pipe. t Some anatomists affirm that they have seen fibres from this muscle reaching the base of the tongue, the epiglottis, and the os hyoides.SUPERNUMERARY MUSCLES OF THE PHARYNX. 4C1 «f tiifl tpmnoral bone, and passes into the walls of the from the P^™ ^^^^^^^^^^ 'authors. 2.

Phan/nqeal mucous membrane. The muscular semi-canal of the pharynx is Unedbv a mucous membrane continuous with the buccal and nasal mucous membranes on the one hand, and with those of the larynx and oesophagus on the other This membrane, which is of a reddish colour, presents some pe- cuUarities at different parts of its extent. Above, near the basilar process, it is thick, and as it were fungous, and closely united to the periosteum, from which indeed it cannot be separated ; in this region it is very Uable to become the seat of fibrous polypi. Near the posterior orifices of the nasal fossae and the openings of the Eustachian tubes, it is, in some respects, similar to the pituitary membrane.* It forms a sort of rim around the trumpet-shaped orifice of the Eustachian tube, into which it is prolonged in a remarkable manner, gradually becoming thinner, and at length continuous with the hnmg membrane of the cavity of the tympanum. This continuity of the mucous membrane of the pharynx and Eustachian tube explains the close sympathy between these parts, and also the deafness which so frequently follows chronic sore-throats and coryzse, in consequence of the obstruction of these tubes. In its buccal portion it exactly resembles the mucous membrane, upon the the lower surface of the velum palati: the part covering the posterior surface of the larynx is pale, and forms several folds. The mucous membrane of the pharynx adheres to the subjacent muscles, only through the medium of very loose cellular tissue, which is never loaded with fat, nor infiltrated with serosity. It is still less intimately adherent to the posterior surface of the larynx. Its surface is raised by a great number of small glands, chiefly occupying the upper part of the pharynx near the posterior nares : we shall divide them into agglomerated and solitary. Two agglomerated glands are always situated around the orifices of the Eustachian tube ; they open upon the mucous mem- brane, either separately or together. These glands are sometimes arranged in a line, sometimes in several parallel rows. Haller believes that the salpicgo- pharyngeus of Santorini and Winslow is nothing more than a series of these glands united together by fibrous tissue. The solitary glands are scattered over the whole extent of the pharynx. Lastly, the pharyngeal mucous mem- brane is provided with a thin epithelium f, which can be easily demonstrated by maceration and the action of acids. » See note, infrd. t [According to Dr. Henle, the upper part of the mucous membrane of the pharynx is co- vered with a ciliated columnar epithelium, as far down as a horizontal line extending from the lower border of the atlas to the floor of tiic nasal fossaj; below that line the epithelium assumesSPLANCHNOLOGY. yiPZtT^ "'T- P'^'^''^"'' ^ P^n^P^'l "'•"^'•i/ on each side, n 11""" Pj^'i'-y'igeal, a branch of the internal carotid.

This abundance of nerves, and also the sources from which they are derived will serve to explain, 1. the great sensibility of the pharynx ; to which part we reter the feeling of thirst, which some have, therefore, proposed to term the pharyngeal sense; 2. the part which it performs in the perception of certain flavours, for example, those of acids ; 3. the sympathy between the pharynx, the base ot the tongue, and the stomach ; 4. the feelings of constriction and strangu- lation, so common in the pharynx ; 5. the spasms with which it is affected in tetanus and hydrophobia; and 6. the nature of the globus hystericus, &c.* Developement. The developement of the pharynx offers no remarkable phe- nomena ; still It IS an exception to the general law of bilateral development, laid down by some anatomists. Uses of the pharynx. The pharynx is one of the principal organs of deglu- tition. It serves also for the passage of air in respiration, and as a tube for niodulating the voice. The importance of the pharynx in this last point of view and the influence which its different degrees of shortening and con- striction exercise upon the compass of the voice, do not appear to me to have sufficiently engaged the attention of physiologists. The (Esophagus. The oesophagus (olaai, I will convey, and <pa.yw, I eat) is a musculo-membra- nous canal, an organ of deglutition, intended to convey the food from the pha- rynx into the stomach. It occupies the lower part of the cervical region and all the thoracic region, and perforates the diaphragm in order to terminate in the stomach. Directions. It is situated in the median line, resting against the vertebral column: its general direction is straight, for the food does not remain in it; nevertheless, it presents several slight curves : at its commencement it is ex- actly in the middle line, but inclines somewhat to the left side in the neck ; in the upper part of the thorax it deviates slightly to the right side, then again becomes median, and lastly inclines to the left, where it passes through the diaphragm. The general direction of the oesophagus permits the introduction of straight probangs into the stomach. The inflection which it undergoes at its entrance into the thorax, explains the reason why these instruments are sometimes arrested opposite the first rib. Dimensions. The length of the oesophagus corresponds to the interval the squamous form, and is not ciliated. In tlie Eustachian tube it is also columnar, and pro- vided with cilia, but in the cavity of the tympanum it is squamous, and destitute of those organs.] ... * We cannot explain why the syphilitic virus has so serious a predilection for tnc mucous membrane of the pharynx.THE ffiSOPHAGUS. 463 between tlie pharynx and the stomach, i. e. the space hetween the fifth cervical vevtebi or?he cricoid cartilage, and the tenth dorsal vertebra In regard to lis S.r ov diameter, the cEsophagus is the narrowest pai-t of the alimentary canal lis diameter is not uniform throughout, the cervical portion* being certainly the narrowest; and therefore foreign bodies which are too large to Ss through the alimentary canal, are generally arrested in the neck. Thewidest nortion of the oesophagus is its lower end. . ^ The « ophagus'is capable of a certain degree of dilatation as is P/oved ^ the passage of large foreign bodies for a considerable distance through it (Mel. d'Hevin, A?ad. Roy. de Chirurgie), sometimes even as far as the stomach. That this dilatability, however, is very limited, may be inferred from the pain caused by swaUowing too large a morsel, and also from the stoppage of foreign bodies in the gullet. Nevertheless, in some cases, from external pressure upon, or from stricture of, some part of this canal, it becomes greatly enlaro-ed above the seat of obstruction, and forms a sort of ampuUa or dilata- tion resembling the crop in gallinaceous birds. In one case I found a sort of pouch, or diverticulum, of the mucous membrane, of considerable size, pro- truding between the separated muscular fibres, and at first sight resembling the crop of gallinaceous birds. An example has been recorded of dangerous suffocation occasioned by the pressure of alimentary matters in a cavity of that kind. Figure. The oesophagus is cylindrical, and differs from the rest of the ali- mentary canal in never containing any air, so that (when at rest) its parietes are always in contact. It is somewhat flattened, and as it were compressed, at its upper part; but below it always presents the appearance of a solid cylinder, or a dense firm cord. This appearance exists through its whole extent in some animals, the horse for example. Like all hollow organs, the oesophagus presents two surfaces, an external and an internal. The external surface. In its long course the oesophagus has many relations, all of which are of great importance, and must be examined in the neck, in the thorax, and in the abdomen. In its cervical portion {y,figs. 114. 140.) the oesophagus is in relation in front with the membranous portion of the trachea (x), beyond which it projects a little on the left side. The cellular tissue uniting these two canals is most con- densed above. All that portion which projects beyond the trachea comes into relation with the left sterno-thyroid muscle (n, .^jf. 114.), the thyroid body (2), the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, and the inferior thyroid vessels, which cross it at right angles. The relation of the oesophagus to the trachea explains how foreign bodies arrested in the former passage may compress the trachea, and impede or even prevent respiration. The deviation of the oesophagus to the left is the reason for selecting that side for the performance of oesopha- gotomy. Behind, it corresponds to the longi colli muscles and to the vertebral column, being united to them by loose cellular tissue, so that it is enabled to execute those movements, which are necessary for the performance of its func- tions. Laterally, it corresponds to the thyroid body, the common carotid artery, and the internal jugular vein ; hut these relations are somewhat modified on each side in consequence of the deviation of the oesophagus. Thus the relations of the oesophagus with the left common carotid are much more immediate than those with the right. The left recurrent nerve lies in front of the oesophagus, the right nerve a little behind it. Its thoracic portion (o,fig. 161.) is situated in the posterior mediastinum, and is in relation in front, commencing from above, with the trachea, then with its bifurcation, and slightly also with the left bronchus, which crosses it obliquely, and which may be compressed by it during the retention of a foreign body, (an example of this accident has been recorded by Habicot); lastly, it is [Opposite the cricoid cartiljige.]SPLANCHNOLOGY. 464 situated opposite and behind the ascending portion of the arch of the aorta, and the base and posterior surface of the heart, from which parts it is separated by the pericardium. Behind, it is in relation with the longus colli and the vertebral column, to which, however, it is not so closely applied as in the neck; nor does it follow the curvature of the spine in the dorsal region, but is sepa- rated from it by a space filled with cellular tissue, lymphatic glands, the vena azygos, and the thoracic duct, the latter being placed to its right side at tfie lower part of the thorax, but passing behind it above, so as to reach the left side. Below, at the point where the oesophagus deviates to the left side in order to gain the opening of the diaphragm, it lies in front of the aorta. On each side it forms a projection along the wall of the mediastinum, which is thus brought into relation with the corresponding lung; it is much more pro- minent on the right than on the left side. On the left side it is also in contact, in its entire extent, with the thoracic aorta {h,fig. 161,), which is situated a little behind it. Above, it has immediate relations with the arch of the aorta, as that vessel is passing backwards and to the left side of the vertebral column. It is commonly, at this point, that aneurisms of the aorta open into the (Eso- phagus. In all this region the oesophagus is enveloped by a serous cellular tissue, extremely loose and very abundant; it is surrounded by a great number of IjTnphatic glands, which have been improperly named oesophageal. These glands when enlarged sometimes compress the gullet so much as completely to arrest deglutition. Lastly, the two pneumogastric nerves run along each side of the oesophagus ; inferiorly the left comes in front and the right retires behind the canal: they communicate with each other throughout their course by loops or arches, which perhaps explains the pain caused by swallowing two large a mass of food. In its abdominal portion (if such can be said to exist) the oesophagus is in relation with the oesophageal opening of the diaphragm, below which it is entirely covered by the peritoneum. On the right side and in front it is em- braced by the left extremity of the liver; behind, by the lobulus Spigelii. In some subjects the abdominal portion of the oesophagus is an inch in length, but this I think is occasioned by descent of the stomach. The internal surfaceis remarkable for its pale colour, which contrasts strongly with the rosy hue of the stomach and the upper part of the pharynx, for the wrinkling of its parietes and their contact with each other, and la.stly for its longitudinal folds, which seem to have reference to the necessity for its mo- mentary distension during the mere passage of the food through it. Structure. The oesophagus is essentially composed of two cylindrical mem- branes, one internal or mucous, the other external or muscular. The muscular coat is remarkable for its thickness, which greatly exceeds that of any other part of the alimentary canal, and is connected with the ne- cessity for the rapid passage of the alimentary mass from the pharynx into the stomach. It is susceptible of hypertrophy, as we find in cases of strictm-e of the lower part of the gullet. I have seen it five or six lines thick. In all herbivorous animals in which the oesophagus is almost incessantly in action, in those in which the food is carried upwards in opposition to gravity during the act of deglutition, in the horse and in ruminants, the muscular coat is still more developed than in man. The muscular coat is of a red colour immediately below the pharynx, and rosy through the rest of its extent, but of a darker tint than in the succeedmg portion of the alimentary canal. It is of a vivid red in herbivora.* This coat is composed of two very distinct layers, the external consisting of longitudinal fibres regularly disposed upon all sides of the oesophagus ; the inter- nal of circular fibres, in which we shall in vain seek for the spiral arrangement . [It consists of involuntary muscular fibres (note, p. 42G.), intermixed with fibres possessing transverse strite.]THE (ESOPHA.GUS. 405 described by some anatomists as existing m animals and in man.* The longi- tudinal fibres seem to arise, at least in pait, from the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage, in the median line, between the two posterior crico-arytenoid mTelesTthey e;idently become continuous below with the longitudinal mus- cular fibres of the stomach. The first muscular ring of the cesophagus appears to arise from the cricoid cartilage ; it has been designated the crtco-cesophageus. There is no sphincter, as some anatomists have affirmed, round the lower ex- tremity of the oesophagus. , , , u, „ „ The mucous membrane. As Bichat has remarked, the mucous membiane of the oesophagus is perhaps, next to the buccal, the thickest in the alimentary canal. By a remarkable exception (also observed m the rectum) its outer surface is united to the adjacent membrane by a very loose cellular tissue; so that the whole mucous cylinder may be removed entire from the sort of mus- cular sheath in which it is contained. It has even been said that the muscular coat can force the mucous membrane downwards by its contraction, so as to produce a projecting rim around the cardiac orifice of the stomach, analogous to that which is formed at the anus in prolapsus. The longitudinal folds of the mucous membrane are not caused by the contraction and elasticity of the cir- cular fibres of the muscular coat, but depend upon a peculiarity of structure. If the first hypothesis be correct, why should not the mucous membrane also present transverse folds from the action of the longitudinal fibres, for the ex- tremities of the oesophagus are not so fixed, nor is its tension so great that it could not be shortened by the action of these fibres. Besides the longitudinal folds, there are also in the oesophagus a number of wrinkles analogous to those of the skin, and therefore irregular; they appear to me to be caused by the elasticity of the muscular fibres. The mucous membrane of the oesophagus has a thick epithelium, which may be easily shown by maceration and the action of acids, or even without pre- paration, and which terminates at the cardiac orifice of the stomach by an irregularly fringed or festooned border, f When examined by the microscope the free surface of the mucous membrane presents a number of small linear ridges, running vertically, and united toge- ther by other oblique ridges, so that the whole surface has a reticulated aspect. These ridges are formed by papillae or villosities, the arteries and veins of which have been accurately figured by Bleuland. The surface of the mucous membrane is raised in various places by small, oblong, and flat glands found here and there over the entire oesophagus. They were first described by Steno, and should be carefully distinguished from the oesophageal lymphatic glands: the latter are external to the oeso- phagus, and in certain animals frequently contain small entozoa : they have been supposed to open into the oesophagus, and to deposit within it a fluid containing these animalcules, which some physiologists have regarded as the chief agent in digestion. Any communication, however, between these lymph- atic glands and the cavity of the gullet is purely accidental. The true oesophageal glands are very numerous. \ In the oesophagus there is only a trace of the fibrous membrane, which forms the framework of the alimentary canal; it adheres to the muscular coat, and is, therefore, but loosely attached to the mucous membrane. There is no external serous membrane; it would not have yielded to the instantaneous dilatation required in the oesophagus. The two laminae of the posterior mediastinum corresponding to its sides, may be regarded as forming the rudiment of a serous coat. Vessels and nerves. The oesophageal arteries are numerous, and arise from several sources. They may be distinguished into the cervical, proceeding * [These fibres are obviously spiral in the ruminant, and many other mammalia.] t [The epithelium is, in fact, continued on through the rest of the alimentary canal, but be- comes thinner, and assumes a dift'erent character : in the cesopliagus it is squamous.] t [Especially around the lower extremity of the gullet.] vol..

H H \466 SPLANCHNOLOGY. from the inferior thyroid; the thoracic, given off either directly from the aorta or troni the bronchial and intercostal arteries, and sometimes from the internal mammary ; and lastly, the abdominal, arising from the coronary artery ot the stomach, and the inferior phrenic. ' The veins terminate in the inferior thyroid, the superior cava, the azygos the internal mammary, the bronchial, the phrenic, and the coronary of the stomach. •' The lymphatic vessels enter the numerous glands which surround the oeso- phagus. The nerves are very numerous, and are derived from the pneumogastrics, which surround the oesophagus with a series of loops; these are joined by some branches from the thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic. The developeme/it of the oesophagus presents nothing worthy of notice. Functions. The oesophagus is intended to convey the food rapidly from the pharynx to the stomach. This function is performed by its longitudinal fibres shortening the passage, and by its circular fibres contracting it successively from above downwards during deglutition ; in vomiting or regurgitation, the contraction proceeds from below upwards. The Stomach. The stomach (yacrriip, ventriculus), one of the principal organs of digestion, is that wide dilatation (s, fig. 139.) of the alimentary canal, intervening be- tween the oesophagus (a) and the duodenum (6 e), in which the food is col- lected and converted into chyme. Situation. It is situated at the junction of the upper tenth with the lower nine-tenths of the alimentary canal, between the organs of deglutition and those of chylification. It occupies the upper part of the abdominal cavity (s,figs. 155. 161.), almost entirely fills the left hypochondrium, and advances into the epigastrium, as far as the limits of the right hypochondrium.* It is maintained in its place by the oesophagus and duodenum, and also by some folds of the peritoneum, which connect it with the diaphragm, the liver, and the spleen. The stomach is, therefore, less subject to displacement than most of the abdominal viscera. It may even be generally stated, that almost all the changes in the relative situation of this organ, are the results of dis- placements or alterations in the size of those organs which are conuected with it. I do not here refer to examples of complete transposition of the viscera, nor to those cases of malformation of the diaphragm, in which the stomach has been found in the thorax. Fig. 148. » [In order to facilitate the description of the vis- cera contained in the abdominal cavity, anatomists have adopted the following artificial division of that cavity into several regions: — The abdomen is first divided into three zones by two horizontal lines, one (a a,fl^. 148.) extending bet^veen the most pro- minent points of the cartilages of the ribs, and the other (4 b) between the crests of the iliac bones. The superior zone is called the epigastric, the mid- dle the umbilical, and the inferior the hypogastric. These three zones are then subdivided by two ver- tical parallel lines, drawn from the cartilages of the eighth rib down to the centre of Poupart's liga- ment. The epigastric zone is thus divided into two hypochondriac (11) and a middle epigastric region (2); the umbilical into two lumbar (3 3), and a middle umbilical region (4); and the hypogastric into two iliac (55), and a middle hypogastric region (G).]THE STOMACH. 467 n H 2 Direction. The stomach is directed obliquely downwards to the right side, and a little forwards; this direction affords some explanation of the almost constant habit of lying on the right side during sleep, and why the rest is dis- turbed, and digestion rendered difficult in those who lie upon the left side. Changes in direction of the stomach depend upon the same causes as changes in its situation. Thus, dragging produced by displacement of the small intestine or the omentum, enlargements of the liver or spleen, or the use of too tight stays *, must necessarily affect the direction of this organ. We not unfrequently find stomachs having a vertical direction. Number. The stomach is single in the human subject as well as in the greater number of animals. The examples of double or triple stomachs in the human subject are merely cases of single stomachs having one or more circular constrictions.f The essential character of a double stomach is not an accidental or even a congenital contraction, but a difference in structure. Bilocular stomachs, indeed, are very common ; but this form (resembUng that of some kinds of calabash-gourds), though sometimes extremely well marked when the stomach is empty, disappears almost entirely when it is much dis- tended by inflation. Size. In all animals, the stomach is the most capacious part of the ali- mentary canal; so that in many species, where its limits are not so clearly de- fined as in man, the existence of a stomach is determined only by the presence of a dilatation. It is of considerable size in herbivora, but comparatively much smaller in carnivora. The himian stomach is intermediate between these extremes — a fact which affords evidence of its adaptation to both vege- table and aliment diet. The himaan stomach, however, presents innumerable varieties in size, from a state of extreme contraction in which it scarcely ex- ceeds the duodenum, to such an enormous degree of dilatation that it occupies a third, a half, or even almost the whole, of the abdominal cavity. These differences depend less upon original variations, than upon its peculiarly dilatable and elastic structure, which enables it to contain a large quantity of food, and to contract more or less completely upon itself when empty. Thus the stomach has a much greater capacity in those who adopt the bad habit of eating only one very full meal in the twenty-four houi-s, than in those who eat more frequently but less abundantly. In some cases of stricture at the py- loi-us, it becomes enormously distended. Long continued abstinence occasions such an amount of contraction, that it has even been asserted, that pain re- sulting from the rubbing of its parietes together gives rise to the feeling of hunger; but this completely mechanical hypothesis should be rejected. In a great number of cholera patients the stomach was found to be exceedingly small. In a female, who died a month after having volimtarily swallowed a small quantity of sulphuric acid, the contracted stomach was not larger than a moderately sized gaU-bladder. Figure. The stomach resembles a flattened cone, curved upon itself back- wards and upwards, and having a rounded base ; it has been compared to the bladder of a bagpipe. Sections made at right angles to its axis represent circles gradually decreasing in size from the entrance of the oesophagus to the pylorus. We have to examine its external and its internal surface. The external surface. From the pecuUar form of the stomach we are enabled to consider an anterior and a posterior surface, a convex border or nml iLn '^possible to insist too strongly upon the influence of too tight stays on the situation 'oH^^ ? 1 J- °\ viscera occupying the base of the thorax.

The anterior surface {upper surf ace of some anatomists, s,fig. 155.), is directed forwards, and a little upwards. When inflated in the dead body with the abdomen open, it is turned directly upwards ; but such cannot take place, either in the living or dead subject, when the abdominal parietes are entire ; m which case the distended stomach passes in the direction of the least re- sistance, i. e. forwards and downwards, and its anterior surface cannot then be completely turned up. This surface is in relation with the diaphragm, and is separated by it from the heart; with the liver, which is prolonged upon it to a greater or less extent*; with the last six ribs, being separated from them by the diaphragm ; and with the abdominal parietes in the epigastrium — hence the name given to that region. It is not uncommon to find the great omentum turned upwards be- tween tlie stomach and the liver. When distended, the stomach has much more extensive relations with the epigastrium, or rather with the abdominal parietes, both in a vertical and transverse direction. All these relations are of the greatest importance ; and with the exception of those which concern the epigastrium, they are constant. In fact it rarely happens that the stomach precisely corresponds to the substernal or xiphoid depression, which has been called the pit of the stomach or the scrobiculus cordis, but which belongs neither to the heart nor the stomach. In exploring this depression, it is almost always the liver which is felt; the stomach lies lower down, and is generally below the ensiform appendix. The posterior surface {htferior surface of some anatomists, seen turned up at s,fig. 154.) is directed downwards and backwards, and is seen in the sac of the omentum, of which it forms the anterior wall. It has relations with the transverse mesocolon, which serves as a floor for it, and separates it from the convolutions of the small intestines ; with the third portion of the duodenum (e' to 6), by some of the older anatomists called the pillow of the stomach (ventriculi pulvinar); and lastly, with the pancreas (o). The duodenum, the pancreas, the aorta (a), and the pillars of the diaphragm (dd), separate it from the vertebral column, upon which it rests obliquely. These relations are modified by the emptiness or fullness of the stomach. The great curvature (the inferior or anterior border of some anatomists, cad, fig. 149.) is convex, and directed almost vertically downwards in the empty con- dition of the organ, and almost directly forwards when it is full; it gives at- tachment to the two anterior layers of the great omentum. It is in relation with the abdominal parietes and the car- tilages of the lower ribs, and lies along the transverse arch of the colon {t, fig. 155.), in front of which it advances when considerably distended; hence it was termed the colic border by Chaussier. In the distended state its relations with the abdominal parietes become much more extensive ; but even then I can scarcely believe the assertions of some, that the pulsations of the gastro-epiploic arteries can be felt by the finger in emaciated individuals.

H H 3 is full; and it then embraces the vertebral column in its curvature, being separated from it by the aorta and the pillars of the diaphragm (see fig. 154.) ; it also embraces the small lobe of the liver or the lobulus Spigelii, the coeliac axis (0, and the solar plexus of nerves. The great extrmiity or great cul-de-sac of the stomach (the bottom or great tuberosity, from c to the dotted line,^5'. 149.), comprises all that portion which is to the left of the cardiac or oesophageal opening ; it is a sort of semi-sphe- roid, applied to the base of the cone formed by the rest of the stomach ; it is the highest and the largest portion of that organ ; it is almost entirely absent in camivora ; it is very large in herbivora, and of a medium size in man. There are also many individual varieties in the size of this portion of the stomach; I have met with some instances in which it was not larger than it is in car- nivora. It is in contact with the spleen (Ay^5'. 154.), (hence it is called the splenic extremity by Chaussier), with which it is connected by a fold of the peritoneum, called the gastro-splenic omentum, and by the vasa brevia. When the stomach is distended it comes into close contact with, and is as it were moulded upon, the spleen (see fig. 161.). From this relation a great number of physiological inferences may be deduced.* The great cul-de-sac occupies the left hypochon- drium, and corresponds also in the greater part of its extent to the left half of the diaphragm, which is in accurate contact with it, and separates it from the lungs above and from the last six ribs in front. It is more or less elevated, according to the degree of distension of the stomach ; and from this we can easily understand that difficult respiration may be caused by too large a meal. Lastly, it may be stated that the great extremity of the stomach has relations behind with the pancreas, and with the left kidney and suprarenal capsule. The (esophageal extremity (o, fig. 149.). The oesophagus opens into the stomach at different angles, according to the emptiness or fullness of that or- gan. The situation of this opening, which is improperly denominated the cardia (cor, heart), is at the left extremity of the lesser curvature, to the right of the great cul-de-sac, and opposite the oesophageal opening in the diaphragm. It is embraced (c,fig. 154.) in front by the left extremity of the liver, which sometimes forms a half circle round it, and behind by the lobulus Spigelii-. It is surrounded by a circle of vessels and some nerves. Examined exter- nally the lower end of the oesophagus is continuous with the stomach, with- out any other line of demarcation than that depending upon a difference in size and direction. The peritoneum is directly reflected from the diaphragm upon the (Esophagus and the stomach, and forms the gastro-diaphragmaticfold (hgamentum phrenico-gastricum, Soemmering).-^ The pyloric extremity (pylorus, from iriiArj, a gate, and oSpoy, a keeper ; p, figs. 149, &c.) is situated at the right extremity of the stomach. It forms the apex ot the cone, and presents a circular constriction or strangulation, which exactly defines the limits between the stomach and duodfenum. About an inch from this constriction the stomach is much curved, so as to form a de- cided 6enc?, and presents a dilatation, on the side of the great curvature corre- sponding to an internal excavation, called by Willis the antrum pylbri, and by others the small cul-de-sac of the stomach (from d to the dotted line e). Not un- commonly we find a second dilatation near the first, and a third, still smaller, on the side of the lesser curvature, resulting from the bend formed by the stomach The pyloric extremity of the stomach is directed to the right side backwards and upwards, and sometimes even a little to the left when the stomach is much distended. foUows allTplaTelemfoVS o^^^ I'h'"'^ connected with the spleen, that it necessarily four times its'^ naS size wi, K^ri in^M."

The relations of the pyloric extremity with the abdominal parietes are very variable, for the changes in the situation of the stomach chiefly affect this ex- tremity. It corresponds to the limit between the epigastrium and the right hypochondrium; sometimesit is in relation with the gall-bladder, andhence may become stained; in some cases it passes to the right of the gall-bladder, to the extent of an inch or an inch and a half I have seen it occupying the hori- zontal fissure of the liver, the edges of which were separated for its reception. Very commonly we find the pylorus in the umbilical region. I have seen it in the hypogastrium in a female who was alfected with schirrus of the pylorus, and I have also found it in the right iliac fossa. It is, therefore, extremely diificult to determine the seat of an organic lesion of the pylorus from external examination. The relations of the pylorus with the abdominal viscera are more constant: above, it corresponds to the liver and the lesser omentum ; below, to the great omentum ; in front, to the abdominal parietes ; and behind, to the pancreas. It is not uncommon to find it adhering to the gall-bladder. The internal surface. This presents the same regions as the external sur- face : all its peculiarities may be referred to the mucous membrane, which will be noticed when the structure of the stomach is described. Besides these, however, we observe here the two orifices of the stomach. The (esophageal orifice (cardiac, left, or superior orifice oslium introitus; o, fig. 150.) is remarkable for its radiated folds (ad stellffi similitudinem. Holier'), which are effaced by distension; for the irregu- larly fringed border and the change in colour which mark the limits between the mucous membrane of the oesophagus and of the stomach; for its size and its capability of dOatation ; and lastly, for the total ab- sence of any valve or sphincter. The duodenal or pyloric orifice (right or anterior orifice, janitor, sphincter, ostium exitus; p} is remarkable for an in- ternal rim or circular valve, which in a distended and dried stomach forms a sort of diaphragm (in speciem diaphragmatis, qualia sunt in tubis telescopicis, Morgagni) ; for the narrowness of the passage, which, with difiiculty, admits the little finger in most subjects; for its slight dilatability; and lastly, for the existence of a muscular ring, which may be regarded as a true sphincter. It is of importance to remark that this orifice, independently of any disease, presents a great number of varieties in its dimensions, and it is probable that these congenital or acquired variations may have some influence upon its diseases. The relative position of these two orifices is an important anatomical point. Upon this we should observe, i. that they are but little apart from each other, considering the size of the stomach, and that the interval between them does not increase in proportion to that size ; 2. that the oesophageal orifice is di- rected upwards, the pyloric opening backwards and a little upwards ; 3. that the two openings are not upon the same plane, the oesophageal being higher and more posterior than the pyloric. The structure of the stomach. In order to study the structure of the stom- ach, it is necessary in the first place to distend it. Two stomachs are indis- pensable for this purpose, one to be dissected from without inwards, and the other from within outwards. One of the stomachs should be everted, and then inflated. The parietes of the stomach are formed by the super-position of four mem- branes or coats, differing in texture and properties. These, proceeding from without inwards, are the serous, the muscular, the fibrous, and the mucous coats. We must also examine the vessels, nerves, and cellular tissue, which enter into the composition of these parietes.471 THE STOMACH. 1 The serous or peritmieal coat. Like almost all the moveable viscera of the abdomen, the stomach receives a complete covering from the peritoneum (mem- brana communis of the ancients ; la membrane capsulaire, Chauss.). It is formed in the following manner. Two layers of the pentoneilm in contact with each other, pass from the transverse fissure of the liver to the lesser cur- vature of the stomach.—there they separate, so as to leave between them a triangular space, the base of which corresponds to the lesser curvature ; the anterior layer then passes over the anterior surface of the stomach, and the posterior covers it behind; they again approach each other at the great cur- vature, along which they form another triangular space, exactly resembling that which we have already described as existing at the lesser curvature, and then unite so as to form the two anterior layers of the great omentum (see description of Peritoneum). The same arrangement takes place at the great extremity of the stomach. Bloodvessels pass round the stomach, along the line where the two layers of the peritoneum are applied to each other at its two curvatures. The peritoneum, therefore, forms a complete covering for the stomach, ex- cepting at the curvatures, where we find triangular spaces, into which the stomach is forced during its distension. I doubt whether these triangular spaces can afford sufficient space for the stomach when greatly distended, and I believe that, in such cases, the two anterior layers of the great omentum se- parate, and are applied upon that organ. It is evident, besides, that distension of the stomach chiefly affects its great curvature. The peritoneal coat does not adhere firmly to the subjacent tissues of the stomach, in the neighbourhood of either curvature; but it is closely united to them at the middle points of both surfaces. The imperfect extensibility of the peritoneal coat requires such an arrangement as exists along the curvatures. I have observed some small fibrous bands in the sub-serous cellular tissue along the lesser curvature, which must be intended to maintain the shape of that part. The uses of the peritoneal coat, in reference to the stomach itself, are merely mechanical; it strengthens, preserves the shape, and facilitates the movements of this organ. The muscular coat. This coat has engaged much of the attention of anatomists, since the time of Fal- lopius, who was the first to give a correct descrip- tion of it; and to whom Morgagni (Advers. Anat. iii. p. 6.) has attributed the honour of discovering it, in opposition to the claims of Willis. Helvetius made it the subject of a special work. (^Hist. Acad. Roy. des Sciences, 1719.) "We shall describe, in accordance with HaUer {Elem. Phys. torn. vi. lib. xix. sect. i. p. 126.), and the majority of anatomists, three layers of muscular fibres. The superficial or longitudinal layer {\,fig. 151.) is formed by a continuation of the longitudinal fibres of the oesophagus, which spread out in a radiated manner from the cardiac orifice of the stomach. They are scattered thinly over its surfaces, the great curvature, and the great extremity, but are collected into a band along the lesser curvature, the shape of which they assist in preserving. On ac- count of this arrangement they have received the name of cravate de Suisse. These fibres form a continuous plane of considerable thickness over the contracted portion of the stomach near the pylorus. In this situation they are stronger, and fasciculated, and appear partly to terminate in the pyloric constriction, and partly to be continued upon the duodenum. II u 4 Fig. 151^"^^ SPLANCHNOLOGY. second or circular layer (2, fig. 151.) is composed of fibres which cross me axis ot the stomach at right angles, so as to form a succession of rings trom the oesophagus to the pylorus. They are few in number at the great ex- tremity of the stomach, but become much more numerous towards the pylorus, throughout all the contracted portion of the stomach. At the pylorus itself they form a thick ring, which forms a sort of rim, projecting in the interior. I have always found this more developed in old age than at any other period of life. It is a true sphincter, which by its contraction efFectuaUy opposes the passage of food and gas from the stomach into the duodenum. It is not un- common to find the whole of this ring, or a half, or two thirds of it, increased to the thickness of three or four lines, independently of any organic lesion. The older anatomists admitted also an oesophageal ring (or esophageal sphincter), similar to that at the pylorus, and having the power of closing the oesophageal orifice. This, however, does not exist; the last circular fibres of the oesophagus do not form a thicker layer than the others. Lastly, the different rings formed by the circular fibres of the stomach in- tersect each other obliquely at very acute angles. The spiral arrangement admitted by Santorini cannot be demonstrated. The third muscular layer (3, fig. 151.), which I have only been able to see distinctly upon hypertrophied stomachs, is composed of looped or parabolic fibres, the middle portions of which embrace the great end of the stomach, extending from tha left side of the cardiac orifice obliquely downwards towards the great curvature, while their anterior and posterior extremities are situated upon the corresponding surfaces of this viscus. The superior loops reach the lesser curvature, the inferior the great curvature, and the intermediate loops seem to be lost upon either surface, or rather to become blended with the circular fibres. This layer of fibres appears intended to compress the great extremity of the stomach, and to push the food into the body of the organ, towards the pylorus. From what has been stated it follows, that, excepting in the vicinity of the pylorus, the muscular layers of the stomach do not form a continuous plane, but have an areolar disposition : the areolae or spaces between the different fibres are of considerable size; hence the necessity for a strong membrane, like the fibrous coat, which, as we shall find, constitutes the framework of the stomach. The muscular fibres of the several layers are much paler than those of the oesophagus.* They have a pearly appearance when seen through the peritoneal coat, which has led to the supposition that they are tendinous. Hence the error of Helvetius, Winslow, and others, who regarded the two white lines running along the two surfaces of the stomach, between the curvatures, as ligaments of the pylorus; they are nothing more than longitudinal muscular fibres. Other authors have merely admitted some tendinous intersections of these fibres. The muscular coat is not uniformly thick at all points. It is very thin at the great cul-de-sac, and becomes much thicker towards the pylorus. It also pre- sents many varieties in different subjects ; it is but slightly developed in large stomachs, and much more so when this organ is contracted. There is a physi- ological as well as a pathological hypertrophy of the muscular coat. In the latter it has been found seven or eight lines thick. The fibrous coat. This coat, the existence of which has been alternately admitted and denied, is situated between the muscular and the mucous coats, and is quite distinct from both. It was known by the ancients as the membrana nervosa f ; it constitutes, properly speaking, the framework of the organ. In order to demonstrate this coat it is sufficient to remove the peritoneal and mus- [They are principally of the involuntary class, but have a few striated fibres .imong them nntf . n. 42fi.l1.

This experiment will also very clearly show the great strength of the fibrous coat, which, even thus unsupported, can bear considerable distension ; while, on the other hand, when this coat has been divided, the remaining membrane or membranes burst through the opening thus made. This coat should not be confounded with the dermis of the mucous meni- brane, for it adheres much more strongly to the muscular coat, into which it sends numerous prolongations, than to the mucous membrane, with which it is connected only by loose cellular tissue. The fibres of this coat have not a parallel arrangement like those of aponeu- roses and fibrous sheaths, but they form a very dense network, the filaments or lamellae of which can be separated by inflation or infiltration. It is con- cerned in a very important manner in chronic diseases of the stomach : it is very liable to hypertrophy; and, in certain cases, acquires a thickness of several lines. The mucous membrane. The history of this membrane is curious. It was for a long time confounded with the mucus, by which it is covered, being re- garded as merely a dried layer of that secretion.* It was pointed out by Fal- lopius, who applied to it the very appropriate appellation of the velvet-like tunic'; but it was first described as a separate membrane by Willis, under the title of the glandular tunic. The discovery was confirmed by the beautiful injections of Ruysch, who gave it the name of epithelium; to which term, however, he did not attach the same meaning as modern authors. It was afterwards regarded as an epidermic membrane, analogous to the epidermis of the skin f, and capable of being thrown oS and renewed. In recent times it has been supposed "to be concerned tanquam omnium lerna malorum; and has become in the present day the object of a great mmiber of most interesting researches. The mucous membrane of the stomach presents an adherent and a free sur- face. The adherent surface is united to the fibrous coat by cellular tissue, so loose as to permit very free motions. The free surface has the following cha- racters. When the stomach is strongly contracted, it forms a number of folds (seefig. 150.), the principal of which are longitudinal; these folds disappear when the organ is distended, as may be shown in an everted stomach. Their only use is to allow of the rapid distension of this organ, a condition that could not have been attained in any other mode, in consequence of the .slight elasticity of the mucous coat. These longitudinal and temporary folds, which are perfectly distinct from the permanent folds observed in other parts of the alimentary canal, are most strongly marked near the pylorus; they are extremely regular, sometimes straight and sometimes flexuous ; and they proceed parallel to each other from the cardiac towards the pyloric orifice. They are intersected more or less obliquely by other winding folds of different degrees, which often give an areolar appearance to the internal surface of the stomach. _ From this arrangement it follows that dilatation of the stomach occurs prin- cipally in a direction across its long axis ; the resources for dilatation in the direction of its axis are much less numerous. Of all the folds of the mucous membrane, the most important is undoubtedly that called the pijloric valve, which is often nothing more than a mere elevation of the membrane by the sphincter muscle. J This circular fold is equally opposed to the regurgita- tion of food from the duodenum into the stomach, and to its passage from the stomach into the duodeniun ; it is completely effaced bv distension, and it be- longs as much to the duodenum as to the stomach. Its upper half has the characters of the gastric ; the lower half offers those of the duodenal mucous • Riolanus states positively (Anthropol, l.ii. c. xii. p. 171.) that the stomach, like the intes- tines, IS composed ol three coats, viz. a common external membrane, a nervous, and a muscuHr on\h'e"inside " " adherent mucus, consisting of the thickest part of the chyle, lines it t Such was the opinion of Haller, lib.xix. p.

We may add, that the folds upon the internal surface of the stomach are termed by the mucous membrane alone, the fibrous coat does not enter into them. Besides these folds, the mucous membrane presents numerous slight and tor- tuous/«?to«;s, dividing it into smaU spaces or compartments, which are either lozenge shaped, hexagonal, polygonal, circular, oblong, or irregular. Examined by the naked eye, the mucous membrane has a soft, spongy, to- mentose, or velvety appearance ; hence the name of villous or velvet-like mem- brane, by which it is still generally known. It is covered by a layer of mucus of variable thickness, which may be detached by friction with a coarse cloth. In order to avoid the inconveniences arising from this method, which is more or less injurious to the texture of the membrane, I have been accustomed to use a gentle stream of water, which at the same time that it completely washes away the mucus', clearly displays the papillary structure of the surface of the membrane. There are some stomachs which might be called granular or glandular, be- cause the mucous membrane has a granular appearance, so that at first sight it might be imagined that some small glandular bodies (like the salivary glands) were scattered over the internal surface of the stomach; but this glandular as- pect is merely apparent, depending upon the circular or semicircular direction of the furrows in the mucous membrane, which give a spheroidal character to the kind of islets that are intercepted between them. This granular appearance is seldom observed over the entire stomach; it rarely exists at the great ex- tremity. I have found it limited to the great curvature ; most frequently it occurs in the vicinity of the pylorus ; sometimes it is observed over all that part of the stomach which is to the right of the ossophagus. These granula- tions are particularly developed in the stomach of the pig. There is one remark upon which too much importance cannot be placed; and that is, the difference in the appearance of the mucous membrane of the great extremity of the stomach, and of the part situated to the right of the oesophagus. Sometimes the line of separation forms a perfect circle ; and this is a very remarkable fact, because in man, who has a single stomach, it may be considered as a rudiment of the division into the compound stomachs found in the lower animals ; for a multiple stomach results rather from some dif- ference in the structure of the mucous membrane, than from the existence of different compartments or distinct cavities. It will not be uninteresting to connect this remark, with what has been already stated regarding bilocular stomachs. We shall now examine the characters of the mucous membrane in the aso- phageal and in the pyloric portion of the stomach. In the oesophageal portion it is thinner, softer, and more vascular, and can only be separated in flakes from the subjacent parts. When the stomach con- tains any liquid after death, this part is converted into a sort of pulp, which becomes of a blackish colour from the action of the acids in the gastric fluid upon the blood contained in the vessels of the stomach. This is the vultaceous softening, which I regard as a post mortem change, but which has been erro- neously confounded with the gelatiniform softening. The second portion of the mucous membrane, i. e. the part situated to the right of the oesophagus, is thicker, stronger, and whiter, and may be separated entire from the other coats. Diseases often observe the line of separation between the right and the left portions of the stomach. Modem pathologists having attached great importance to the condition of the gastric mucous membrane, it has become highly interesting to determine its characters in the healthy state; these characters relate to its colour, its con- sistence, and its thickness. Colour. It is extremely difiicult to determine what is the natural colour oj this mucous membrane. The opinion generally maintained by tlie best author-THE STOMACH. 475 ities that it is either primarily or secondarily affected in the majority of di'jeases compels us to reject all observations made upon persons who have died from acute or chronic diseases, or even from wounds or mjuries of long standing We are therefore obliged to have recourse to cases of accidental death i^' persons previously in health. In such cases, for example, in criminals who are executed whilst the stomach is empty, the mucous membrane is found of a greyish white colour, with a sUght tint of yellow and pink. * When death has occurred during digestion, the mucous membrane is found to vary from a delicate pink to the most vivid red. After putrefaction has made some little progress, we find a red or port wine colour, or a brownish black tint prevailing over the great extremity of the stomach, and at the free edges of the folds or wrinkles to which the vessels correspond; again, it is often found marked with blackish patches, or marbled ; but these discolourations are the result of post mortem transudation. In the pultaceous and blackish softening of the mucous membrane, the co- lour is owing to the action of the acids in the gastric juice. When the sto- mach contains bile, the mucous membrane is tinged with yellow or green, and the stain sometimes remains after the longest maceration. If the mucous membrane be rubbed with a rough cloth, so long as the ves- sels contain blood, we may produce a red punctuated appearance, which has been often mistaken for a sign of inflammation. Lastly, in the aged we not unfrequently observe a slate grey colour, either in points or in patches, or dif- fused over the surface. This colour occupies the papillae, and may afford proof of some former irritation, but is certainly not due to any diseased action during the later periods of life. These different discolourations of the stomach must not be confounded with the alterations in its colour resulting from disease. Thickness. It is difficult to estimate the exact thickness of the gastric mu- cous membrane. Like the muscular coat it varies in diflferent individuals ; in chronic inflammation it is twice or three times its natural thickness. In de- termining the thickness of this membrane, it is important to bear in mind the difference in this particular, between the oesophageal and pyloric portions; the former being extremely thin, and the latter twice or three times as thick as that. Consistence. The same remarks apply to its consistence, for there are many individual varieties in this respect. The oesophageal portion may be torn with great ease; but the pyloric portion is so dense that the back, and even the edge of a scalpel may be drawn over it with considerable force without wounding it. If there has been any liquid, or even food in the stomach, in however small quantity, the mucous membrane of the oesophageal portion, when macerated, is converted into a pulp; moderate distension wiU then rupture the walls of the stomach, which may be broken through by the point of the finger. From want of sufficient reflection upon this subject, men of great merit have committed serious errors in the appreciation of- morbid lesions. In the gelatiniform softening the gastric mucous membrane, as well as the other coats of the stomach, become dissolved and resemble a solution of gelatine. In many old people, and in some adults, I have found the mucous membrane so thick and so strong, that it could be dissected off entire, and removed in one piece. This condition co-existed with the slate colour, either accompanied or not with chronic inflammation. The papilla. If we examine the mucous membrane of the stomach, placed under water, and exposed to the direct rays of the sun by the aid of a power- ful lens, we shall find that its surface is very irregular, mamillated, and fur- rowed, so as to present an appearance very like the convolutions of the small * In a great number of jnchviduals who have died from acute or chronic diseases the eastrip mucous membrane is found in the same state as in those who have died accidentallv • it is tlierelore, not always affected, either primarily or secondarily, in disease.

The alveoli, or pits, are separated from each other by small projections or papillae {fig. 153.), of which the papillae of the tongue con- MagniHed 32 diameters. ygy an eXCeUcUt idea.* Should these papillae be distinguished from other projections that have been termed villi, by Ruysch, for example, who called the entire membrane villoso- papillaris ? After the most minute examination, I have only detected one order of eminences f, viz. the papilla, the existence of which I regard as the es- sential character of all tegumentary membranes, whether mucous or cutaneous, which might all, therefore, be designated papillary membranes. We shall return again to the structure of the papillae. K we examine with a lens or simple microscope, a perpendicular or ob- lique section of the mucous membrane of the stomach, we shall perceive that it consists essentially of a strong membrane, the mucous dermis, from which arise an immense number of small eminences closely pressed together, and of unequal lengths, like the pile of velvet. These eminences are the papillae; they are liable to great enlargement in cases of hypertrophy, and then the structure just described becomes very apparent. The follicles. The follicles of the stomach can be very easily demonstrated in the pig \, and in the horse. In the last-mentioned animal, entozoa are fre- quently found in the centre of these follicles, which then become developed into hard, and sometimes very large, tumours. It is so difficult to demonstrate them in the human subject, that, with most anatomists, I for a long time doubted their existence. Haller only saw them once or twice § ; but in some individuals they are very distinct. I found them well marked in a great number of cholera patients. || They are not situated in the submucous cel- lular tissue, as is generally stated, but in the substance of the membrane itself, so as to form a projection on the inside of the stomach, but not on the outer surface. They are rounded, flattened, and perforated by a central foramen, which is usually visible to the naked eye. I have observed them upon all points of the mucous membrane, but they appear to be most numerous near the oesophageal orifice, and along the lesser curvature.^ * [The alveoli are from jijth to j^th of an inch, and, near the pylorus, yfe'h of an inch In diameter. At the bottom of each alveolus is seen a group of minute apertures (fig. 152.), which are the open mouths of small tubes placed perpendicularly to the surface of the membrane, and closed at tlie other end. In a vertical section of the membrane these tubes, which average about jnjjth of an inch in diameter, are seen to rest upon the submucous tissue by their closed extremities. In the cardiac portion of the stomach they are short and straight; near the py- loric end they are longer, and convoluted, or irregularly dilated, and are sometimes bifurcated. Bloodvessels pass up between these tubes, and form a capillary network round the borders of the alveoli. The membranous projections, sometimes found between the alveoli (fig. 153.), form irregular fringes, broader than the lingual papilla;, and seem rather to be imperfectly developed villi (see note, p. 4^7 ), and are usually so called. The epithelium covering the entire mucous membrane of the stomach, consists of a single layer of minute columnar cells; it is very del icate, and invisible except by a high magnifying power ; hence its e.xistence was formerly denied.] t Upon this subject see the Memoir of Helvetius. (Hist. Acad. Roy. des Sciences, 1720.) 1 [In the pig these follicles appear to be nothing more than prolongations of the mucous membrane, or small diverticula; so that, aft r having detached the mucous membrane, they may, by slight pressure, be turned inside out.] ,.„,.■ n § " Neque rejici debent, etsi non semper possmt ostendi."

Schmiedel ( Variet. Vasormn, No. xix p 26 ) has seen the coronary vein of the stomach anastomose with the renal vein ; the pyloric with the vena azj gos, and one of the vense breves with the phrenic vein. . ■ i i, The lymphatic vessels are very numerous, and terminate in the lympnatic glands, situated along the two curvatures of the stomach. The peculiar ducts, said to proceed from the spleen to the stomach, and supposed by the ancients to be passages for the atra bilis, are purely imaginary. The nerves are of two kinds, some being derived from the eighth pair, and others from the solar plexus. The nerves of the eighth pair form a plexus round the cardiac orifice ; the left nerve being distributed upon the anterior, and the right upon the posterior surface of the stomach. They may be followed as far as the muscular coat, where they seem to be lost; division of them paralyses this coat. By means of the nerves of the eighth pair, the stomach is connected with the oesophagus, the lungs, the pharynx, the larynx, and the heart. Through the nerves de- rived from the central epigastric plexus, and named after the arteries that support them, the stomach is connected with the ganglionic system, and is brought into relation with the numerous viscera of the abdomen. Lastly, a very delicate serous cellular tissue unites the different coats of the stomach. There are three layers of this tissue, viz. one between the peritoneal and the muscular coats, another between the muscular and the fibrous, and a third between the fibrous and the mucous coats. The last of these is the most distinct; it is liable to both serous and sanguineous effusions, and may become the seat of diffuse inflammation. I have lately seen it infiltrated with pus to a considerable extent, the mucous and the fibrous coats being both per- fectly healthy. Developement of the stomach. The stomach of the foetus is remarkable on account of its vertical position, which is due to the great developement of the liver, especially of its left lobe. An unnatural developement of that lobe will also occasion a similar position of the stomach in the adult. The relative smaUness of the stomach, and the slight developement of its tuberosity, are also characteristic of its foetal condition.* Nevertheless, from the first moment of its appearance, it is distinguished from the rest of the alimentary canal by its greater size. The changes which the adult stomach undergoes, and the variations in size which it presents, are perhaps less dependent upon congenital differences than upon particular habits. The differences in the two sexes are manifestly due to the pressure, to which the stomach of the female is subject, either from the use of stays, or from the gravid uterus. I may here advert * [At early periods of foetal life, villi are found on the mucous membrane of the stomach ge- nerally, afterwards on the pyloric portion only ; and, subsequently to birth, the only traces of these are the irregular fringes observed here and there between the alveoli.]SPLANCHNOLOGY. bo,^in?^^^?P'^'?^^°* °^ muscular ring of the pylorus, and of the neigh- bouring part of the stomach in aged persons. i-ttncijoB The stomach is the organ of chymification, or of that process by wnicn the tood is converted into a homogeneous grey pulp, called chyme. For mat purpose it is evidently necessary that the food should remain for some tune in this organ, and the elasticity of the muscular coat of the oesophagus and ot the ring at the pylorus, are sufficient to prevent its regurgitation into tne gullet, or its passage into the duodenum. When the process is completed, however, the peristaltic contraction of the muscular fibres of the stomach over- comes the resistance of the pylorus ; in eructation, regurgitation, and vomiting, the same peristaltic movements are assisted by the contraction of the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles. Chymification is a chemical, or at least a molecular, action, and is effected by means of the gastric juice, mixed with the salivary and oesophageal secre- tions. These fluids are acid.* The influence of the nerves upon digestion has been ascertained by inge- nious experiments, the results, of which however have been interpreted in various ways. The Intestines in general. The term intestine, in its widest signification, is applied to the whole ali- mentary canal; but, in a more limited sense, it means that long and frequently convoluted tube, extending from the pylorus to the anus, and occupying al- most the whole of the abdominal cavity. The intestines have been divided according to their caliber into the small (b to d,fig. 139.) and the large (e to i); this distinction, which is applicable to most animals, is anatomically established in man, by a difference in size, by the sacculated character of the large intes- tine, by a difference in direction, by the presence of a valve, by the existence of a csecum and of a vermiform appendix, and, lastly, by a difference in structure, especiaUy in the muscular and mucous coats. The same distinction is recognised in physiology, and upon equally good grounds, for the small intestine is essentially concerned in the formation and absorption of the chyle, while the large intestine is the organ of defecation, f These differences will be rendered more apparent from the description of these two important parts of the alimentary canal. The Small Intestine. The small intestine includes all that part which is situated between the stomach and the large intestine (6 to d,fig. 139.). According to HaUer, Bichat, and their followers, the upper portion, called the duodenum (b to c), should be abstracted from the small intestine, which, according to them, would commence at the termination of the duodenum. It appears to me that the former defini- tion should be adhered to, on account both of the absence of any real line of separation between the duodenum and the rest of the small intestine, and of their similarity in structure and function. The small intestine is divided into three parts, the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The division between the duodenum and the rest of the small intestine is definite, but that between the jejunum and the ileum is altogether arbitrary; so that we shall follow the example of Haller, Soemmering, and others, in describing the jejunum and Ueum together (c to d), under the name of the small intestine, properly so called. * [The saliva, though sometimes acid, is usually alkaline.] t The division into a small and large intestine exists among all vertebrated animals; but no animals, excepting the ourangs and the wombat, have both a ca;cum and an appendix vermi- formis. In some we find one caecum, or several ca;ca; in others one or more vermiform ap- pendices ; others have neither ctecum nor appendix, but a valvular fold and a well-marked change in diameter indicate the limit between the small and l.irgc intestines. In some, again, the only diflerence consists in a change of diameter.479 THE INTESTINES. The Duodenum. Dissection When the abdomen is opened, the first portion only of this intes- tine is visible ; the second is hid by the ascending colon; the third is seen m the cavity of the omentum. The second is brought into view by turning aside the colon The third portion, which is the most difficult to demonstrate, may be exposed in two ways, either by cutting through the inferior layer of the transverse mesocolon, or by turning the stomach upwards after havmg di- vided the layers of the great omentum, which are attached along its greater *^"^Thrrf«orfe7!Mm {m^Ka UktvXov, p b,fig. 154.), so caUed by Herophilus (Galen, Administr.

Its fixed position, its structure, and its curvatures, have led to its being described separately.* It is difficult to determine its precise situation with regard to the abdominal parietes. It is not exclusively confined to any one region, but occupies in suc- cession the adjacent borders of the right hypochondrium and the epigastrium, of the right lumbar and the umbilical regions, and of the epigastric and um- bilical regions. The duodenum is found more deeply situated in proportion as we recede from the pylorus, and hence the difficulty of exploring it through the parietes of the abdomen. It is fixed firmly in its place by the peritoneum, by the me- senteric vessels and nerves, which bind it down, and by the pancreas. This fixedness is one of its principal peculiarities, and is indispensable in conse- quence of its relations with the ductus communis choledochus; for had it been moveable like the rest of the small intestine, incessant obstructions to the flow of the bile would have occurred. It follows also that the duodenum can never form part of a hernia; its first portion may, indeed, be displaced, for it IS less firmly fixed than the remainder, and is sometimes dragged out of its proper situation by the pyloric extremity of the stomach. tl.o S™,™"'"'""' of ductus communis choledochus, as the lower limit ofSPLANCHNOLOGY. Dimensions. It is eight or nine inches in length; its caliber is somewhat greater than that of the rest of the small intestine, but the difference is not so decided as to warrant the names of second stomach, or ventriculus succenturialus, which have been given to it. I have even met with subjects in whom the duodenum, when moderately distended, was five inches, while the succeeding portion of small intestine was six inches in circumference. It has been supposed that this part is more dilatable than the rest of the small intestine ; this has been attributed to the absence of the peritoneum. The fact and the explanation are equally without foundation. It is the fibrous membrane, and not the peritoneal coat, which is opposed to dilatation of the intestines. Direction. This is very remarkable. Commencing at the pylorus, the duodenum passes upwards to the right side and backwards ; having reached the neck of the gall bladder, it suddenly changes its direction, and becomes vertical, forming an acute angle with the former portion; this \s its first curva- ture (e) : then, after proceeding vertically through a variable space, it passes transversely from the right to the left side, and becomes continuous with the rest of the small intestine. This change in its direction takes place at a right angle, and is, therefore, less abrupt than the former; the point at which it occurs is called the second curvature (e ). ^ It follows then that the duodenum describes a double curve, or rather one single curve, of which the concavity is directed towards the left, and the con- vexity to the right side. Haller has ingeniously compared the course of the duodenum to two parallel lines, intersected by a perpendicular. This double change in the direction of the duodenum, which is probably intended to re- tard the passage of the food, enables us to consider it as composed of three portions, distinguished as the first (p e), second (e e), and third (e'd). Relations. These should be studied in each of the three portions. Relations of the first portion. Above, with the liver (I', fig. 154.* ) and the gall- bladder {g), to the neck of which it is imited by a fold of the peritoneum. It is not uncommon to see the gall-bladder and the duodenum closely adherent to each othei', and to find an opening through which biliary calculi have passed into the gut. In front, with the gastro-colic omentum and the abdo- minal parietes. Behind, with the hepatic vessels, and the gastro-hepatic omen- tum. This portion of the duodentun, which may be denominated the hepatic, is about two inches in length. Relations of the second portion. In front, with the right extremity of the arch •of the colon (t,fig. 161., e being the duodenum), which crosses it at a right angle. Behind, with the concave border of the right kidney, along which it descends to a greater or less distance, together with the vena cava inferior and the ductus communis choledochus. Sometimes this portion is not in re- lation with the kidney, but rather with the vertebral column. The ductus com- munis choledochus {c,fig. 169.) and the pancreatic duct («) enter the intestine at the posterior and inner surface, and below the middle of this portion of the duodenum. The relations of the duodenum behind are direct, i. e. without the intervention of the peritoneum. On the right, this portion of the duode- num is in relation with the ascending colon (a, fig. Ifil.). On the left, with the pancreas ( o, fig. 154.), which is closely united to it, and embraces it in a sort of half groove. This second portion is two or three inches in length; it may be called the renal portion. Relations of the third portion. The third portion is situated in the substance of the adherent border of the transverse mesocolon. Beloiv, it rests upon the lower border of that fold. Above, it is bounded by the pancreas, which adheres closely to it. In front, it corresponds to the stomach, from which it is separated by the layer of peritoneum which lines the sac of the great omentum. Behind, it corresponds to the vertebral column, from which it is separated by the aorta (a), the vena cava, and the pillars of the diaphragm {d d). f » In ivhii'h fiffiirp the liver and stomach are turned upwards. . t n subjfct I found a fourth portion which passed upwards, and wa, about one inch ,n length, 80 that the duodenum described a tlnrd curve with its concavity directed to the right.THE INTESTINES. 481 As the internal surface and the structure of the duodenum are very analogous to those of the jejunum and ileum, I shall postpone their description until I have noticed the external conformation of the rest of the small intestine. The Small Intestine^ or Hie Jejunum and Jkunu The small intestine, properly so called (c d,Jig. 139.; i i i,fig. 155.), or the je- junum and ileum, consists of that portion of the alimentary canal which fills almost the whole of the ahdomen, occupies the umbilical, hypogastric, iliac, and lumbar regions, and is surrounded, as it were, more or less completely by the large intestine (e/5rA,^if. 139.; atd,fig. 155.). Its upper extremity (j",^^'. 161.), is continuous, without any Fig. 155. line of separation, with the duodenum. The distinction between the two parts is established by the angle which the mesentery forms with the mesocolon, or rather by the point where the superior mesenteric vessels cross over the small intestine. Its lower extre- mity (rfj^gr. 139.; ijig.l&\.) enters at a right angle into the large intestine. The old division of the small intestine into the jejunum and ileum should be ba- nished with other anatom- ical niceties, for it is found- ed only upon trivial dis- tinctions ; and although the upper part of this intestine differs in many respects from the lower, still the alteration takes place by imperceptible gradations. * So that Winslow, unable to find any real diiference, established a purely con- ventional distinction, by proposing to call the upper two fifths the jejunum, and the lower three fifths the ileum. No portion of the alimentary canal is so moveable as the small intestme, properly so called. It is exceedingly loosely attached, or, as it were, sus- pended from the vertebral column by a large fold of the peritoneum, called the mesentery (the attached portion of which is seen at m, fig. 161.), which, being broader in the middle than at either extremity, gives an unequal mobility to the different parts supported by it. The smaU intestine is displaced with great facility. The circular boundary described around it by the large intestine, is only ex- act above, where the mesocolon and the arch of the colon {t, fig. 155.) com- pletely separate it from the stomach (s), the liver (? ), the spleen {k), and the duodenum.

I. 11SPLANCHNOLOGY. 482 of the colon (/), it descends into the pelvis, and, extending laterally, passes in front of the colon in both the right and left lumbar regions. This excessive mobility is one of the most characteristic and important facts re- garding the small intestine, which, in some measure, floats iu the abdominal cavity, yielding to the slightest impulse or concussion. Of all the viscera it is the most frequently involved in hernia. It is liable to invagination, i. e. one portion may be received, as into a sheath, into that immediately succeeding it. When any organ in the abdomen becomes enlarged, the small intestine yields, and passes in the direction where there is least resistance. It appears to partake of the mobility of fluids. It collects together, or spreads out; it moulds itself upon the adjacent parts, and fills up every space, so as to elude all causes of compression ; and by means of this admirable contrivance, the abdomen ac- commodates itself without inconvenience to the occasional enormous develope- ment, either natural or diseased, of the organs contained within it. Direction. We have seen that the upper or supra-diaphragmatic portion of the digestive canal is straight. The stomach presents one slight curve. The duodenum has two decided curves, and the rest of the small intestine pursues a not less flexuous course. The following is the direction of this intestine : commencing at the duodenum (j, fig. 161.), it passes forwards and tothe left side; it is then folded a great number of times upon itself, and, at its lower part, it passes transversely from the left to the right side, and a little upwards, in order to enter at a right angle (i) into the great intestine. The numerous foldings or turnings (gyri) of the smaU intestine upon itself have received the name of convolutions; they are moulded upon each other, without intermixing or becoming entangled, so as to form a mass which so closely resembles the surface of the brain, that the term convolutions has also heen applied to the winding eminences of that organ. Each convolution represents an almost complete circle. In the complexity presented by the numerous windings of the small intestine, it appears to be very difficult to assign to it any general direction ; nevertheless, if we con- sider that the small intestine commences to the left of the second lumhar ver- tebra, and terminates in the right iliac fossa, it wiU be seen that its general direction coincides with that of the membranous fold (m,fig. 161.), which sup- ports it; that is, it may be expressed by an oblique line running downwards from the left to the right side. If, however, we examine the particular di- rection of the convolutions, we shall find that they all present a concavity towards the mesentery, and a convexity towards the panetes of the abdomen, so that each resembles the half of the figure 8. In consequence of this arrange- ment, the intestine may become folded without much change in its position either in advance or otherwise ; and hence the great number of folds which can be placed between two points so near each other as the left side of the second lumbar vertebra and the right iliac fossa, the distance between which is not more than four inches. , , „ , „•...• i Dimensions The determination of the length of the small intestine, properly so caUed, has at aU times been a subject of interest. Meckel says that it vanes from thirteen to twenty-seven feet, including the duodenum. According to my observations, it varies from ten to twenty-five feet in the adult* The length of the small intestine, compared to that of the large intestine, is generally as five to one The different results which have been obtained by various authors may be exDlained partly by individual varieties, and partly by the mode in which ?he mtsureme'n^ made. Thus, a more or less Pe^f ^epar^tion o the Jut from the membranous folds which support it would lead to different re- mits Zt another and less understood cause of difference is the influence of he caUber of the intestine upon its length. The caliber and the length have always an inv rse ratio to each other. Of this we may be easily convinced by strongly inflating a portion of gut which has been previously measured. I have in another M ; m a third 18 ; in a fourth20 ; and in a hfth 2i.483 THE INTESTINES. I I 2 often been struck with the shortness of the small intestine in cases of hernia, accompanied with retention of the contents of the gut above the strangulation. Some authors have attempted to establish a relation between the length of the intestine and the stature of the individual; and it has been affirmed, that the former is four or five times the height of the body. But differences in stature have not a uniform relation to the length of the alimentary canal. Lastly, individual varieties in the length of the small intestine do not appear to have any influence upon the activity of the digestive process. Caliber. The caliber of the small intestine, properly so called, is not the same throughout. It is greater at the commencement than at the termination of the intestine. When moderately distended by inflation, I have found it six inches and four lines in circumference at its commencement, four inches and two lines at the middle, and three inches and a half a little above its entrance into the large intestine; but at the point of entrance itself it is dilated to about four inches and a half. The small intestine, therefore, is funnel-shaped—a form Avhich must facili- tate the rapid passage of its contents, by causing them to proceed from a wider into a narrower space. Lastly, the caliber of the small intestine presents many varieties. When any obstruction occurs to the passage of its contents, it may attain the caliber of the large intestine. In certain cases of marasmus, when it contains no gases, it becomes so contracted that the tube is completely obliterated. Figure and relations. The smaU intestine is cylindrical; a section of it is al- most circular. Its posterior border, to which the mesentery is attached, is con- cave ; it is thrown into slight folds, as every straight cylinder must be, when it is bent into a curve. Its anterior border is convex, free, and corresponds to the abdominal parietes, being separated from them by the great omentum *, which seems intended to contain the whole mass of the intestinal convolutions. When the omentum is wanting, as in the foetus, or in cases of displacement from its being rolled up into a cord, the small intestine is in immediate contact with the parietes of the abdomen. The lateral surfaces of the different convolutions of the small intestine are in contact with each other. As these surfaces are convex, they intercept tri- angular spaces before and after them, in which either effused blood, or serum, or pus, or false membranes, are sometimes collected. The small intestine corresponds to all the regions of the abdomen, excepting those of the upper zone. Not uncommonly we find it escaped from under the omentum, and situated between the liver and the abdominal parietes, or reaching into the left hypochondrium. It is immediately forced, as it were, in any di- rection in which there may be an opening.f More or less of the small intestine is always found in the pelvis ; in the male between the bladder and the rectum, in the female between the bladder and the uterus, and between the uterus and the rectum. In several persons who were emaciated from chronic diseases, and in whom the vertebral column could be plamly felt through the parietes of the abdomen, I have found almost the whole, and, m some cases, even the whole, of the small intestine within the pelvis, con- tracted and ahnost entirely void of air. When one portion only of the smaU mtestme is m the pelvis, it is invariably the lower part. When any large mass is developed in the abdomen, as in pregnancy, or in encysted dropsy of the ovarium, the small intestine passes upwards and late- rally, becomes diffused, fills up every space, and ahnost always escapes com- pression in the most remarkable manner. r uncommon to find in the small intestine, appendices or diverticula, lUce the lingers of a glove, which are sometimes two or three inches in length, t U?-^-' M^-.*^® ^reat omentum has been removed.] it i.

These divierticula are usually much nearer the lower than the upper part of the small intestine. They are formed by all the coats of the bowel, and are very different from mere protru- sion of the mucous membrane through the muscular coat, of which I have seen one example in the duodenum, and which I have often met with in other parts of the small intestine. In a subject which I recently examined, the small intestine presented about fifty spheroidal tumours, of unequal size, all situated along the mesenteric side of the gut, and formed by protrusions of the mucous membrane through the muscular fibres. Structure of the Small Intestine. Dissection. This structure must be studied upon a distended and moist por- tion of intestine, upon a distended and dried specimen, and also upon one in- verted and distended. It is also of importance to study the mucous membrane under water, with the assistance of a strong lens. Injections thrown in first by the veins and then by the arteries, are also useful in developing its structure.* The small intestine, as well as the stomach, is formed of four coats or membranes, which, proceeding from without inwards, are the serous, muscular, fibrous, and mucous coats. The serous coat. The arrangement of this coat upon the duodenum differs from that upon the rest of the small intestine. The peritoneum is applied to the first portion of the duodenum in the same way as upon the stomach, i. e. it covers it entirely, excepting in front and be- hind, where there is a triangular space devoid of this coat. Like the stomach, this first portion gives attachment to the great omentum in front, and to the small omentum behind. The fold of peritoneum which passes from the liver to the duodenum has been improperly called the hepatic ligament of the duode- num. The peritoneum merely passes over the front of the second and third portions of the duodenum, so that the posterior surface of the intestine is in immediate contact with the parts with which it is in relation, and is very per- fectly fixed. The peritoneum forms a complete sheath for the small intestine, properly so called, excepting along its concave border, where the two layers which consti- tute the mesentery separate from each other, so as to include the bowel. In this situation we find a triangular cellular space, exactly resembling those which we have already described along the curvatures of the stomach, and performing a similar ofl5ce, viz. that of remedying the slight extensibility of the peritoneum, and permitting the intestine to imdergo sudden dilatation to a great extent. We should have a very incorrect notion of the dilatability of the intestine if we imagined that it is limited by the triangular space along its concavity, for when the bowel is much distended, the mesentery itself becomes separated into its two layers to allow of such distension. Of this I am con- vinced, from having measured the antero-posterior diameter of the mesentery both before and after inflation of the bowels. The cellular tissue which unites the peritoneal to the muscular coat is extremely delicate, and its adhesion to the latter coat increases in proceedmg from the concave to the convex border of the intestine. Although the peri- toneal coat is very thin, and so transparent that the muscular fibres may be seen through it, yet it has considerable strength. The muscular coat is composed of two layers of involuntary muscular fibres, one superficial, the other deep. The superficial layer is the thinner; it consists of loneitudinal fibres placed around the bowel in a very regular manner, and forming a continuous plane. I have never found these fibres more numerous at the mesenteric than at the convex border. This layer of fibres is almost alwavs removed with the peritoneal coat, to which it adheres very mtimately. From their white colour and shining appearance under the serous membrane, they have been supposed to be of a tendinous nature. * The internal surface qfthe small intestine will be noticed witli the mucous membrane.THE INTESTINES. 485 11 .3 It is difficult though by no means important, to determine exactly whether the sme fibre 'reach the whole length of the intestine or whether they are m- en4pTed atTntervL.

They appear to me to describe complete circles, and to have their ends united. Thpv have no tendinous intersections. . The JibrZ coat is intermediate between the muscular and mucous tunics, and presents the same characters as m the stomach. , The mucous or papillary membrane. Its extaiial surface adheres to the fabrous membrane by a loose cellular tissue, which is Uable to serous, sanguineous, and purulent infiltration. The emphysematous or (Edematous condition may be imitated in the dead body, by everting a portion of bowel and distending it either with air or water. The tenuity of the mucous membrane displayed in these experiments has led to the opinion that this coat is nothing more t^ian an epithelium, a continuation of the epidermis of the skin, and that the fibrous coat represents the cutaneous dermis. Its internal surface is free, and is covered with niore or less mucus: it is remarkable for its duplicatures or valves, caMei valvules conniventes; for its highly developed papillcB, and for the ar- rangement of its/oZZt'cZes. TTie Valvules Conniventes (^Valvules Intestinales). Dissection. Evert the small intestine, so that its external surface becomes internal, and then plunge it in water ; or, what is better, lay open the bowel, and examine its internal surface under water. Also study a portion of intestine inflated and dried. Hitherto the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal has only presented to our notice certain folds which are intended to facilitate the dilatation of that canal, as in the oesophagus and stomach, and which are completely effaced by distension. The folds of the mucous membrane of the small intestine fulfil another purpose; and although they must, undoubtedly, in some measure assist in the elongation and dilatation of the bowel, yet they are never entirely effaced, however far this extension in length or width may be carried. These folds deserve a special description. They are called valvules conniventes or the valves of Kerkringius, although Fallopius had given a complete description of them before that anatomist. Kerkringius gave them the name of conniventes (conniveo, to close partially). They commence in the duodenum (see fig. 169.), an inch or sometimes two inches from the pylorus; and it is not un- common to find them preceded by some vertical folds. They are few and small at first, but become very numerous and very large towards the end of the duodenum and the commencement of the small intestine properly so called. From the upper two fifths of that intestine they gradually diminish in number, and become less regular and less marked towards the lower part of the small intestine ; sometimes they are altogether wanting in the last two or three feet of the bowel. In some rare cases I have seen valvulae conniventes as far down as the ileo-cEBcal valve ; in no part are they sufficiently numerous to have a true imbricated arrangement. These valves are placed perpendicularly to the axis of the intestine, and describe one half, two thirds, or three fourths of a circle ; but they seldom form a complete ring. They are broader in the middle, being from two or three lines in width, than at their extremities, which are slender. In order to ascertain their dimensions, they must be placed under water, or studied upon a fresh portion of intestine. They are generally parallel, incline towards each other by their extremities, bifurcate, and send off small verticular oblique prolongations. Sometimes we find small valves placed be- tween the larger ones. Some of them are suddenly interrupted so that they might be supposed, at first sight, to have undergone some loss of substance.SPLANCHNOLOGY. Several of them are alternate, and seem to be disposed in a spiral manner • but there is no general rule in this respect; their free edge is sometimes directed towards the pylorus and sometimes towards the ileo-ciEcal valve. Their di- rection is very irregular; they yield to any impulse that maybe communicated to them, and their free edge passes either upwards or downwards, according to circumstances. When examined upon a dried specimen, they resemble very much the diaphragms in optical instruments. _ The valvulae conniventes are fonned by folds of mucous membrane, with- in which we find some loose cellular tissue, different kinds of vessels and nerves. Inflation, by raising the mucous membrane, completely effaces them. The fibrous coat presents a slight thickening opposite the bases of these valves. The valves, notwithstanding the ease with which they are moved, must in some manner retard the passage of the food, without offering any decided re- sistance to it, for that would become a cause of obstruction, and give rise to serious accidents. Their chief use, perhaps, is to increase the extent of sur- face : according to Fabricius they double the surface of the intestine, Fallopius says they increase it three times, and Kew six times. Soemmering has given the somewhat conjectural opinion, that the surface of the intestinal mucous membrane is greater than that of the entire skin. {Corpor. Hum. Fabrica. t. vi. p. 295.) Although not peculiar to the human species, they are much more developed in man than in the lower animals. Besides the valvulse conniventes, the mucous membrane of the small intestine presents some irregular folds, which are effaced by distension. The Papillx, or Villi. _ Preparation. \. Place the opened intestine in water, exposing it to a strong light, and agitate the fluid. A stream of water previously received upon the membrane, wUl remove the mucus, which sometimes forms a tenacious sheath around each papilla.* 2. Roll up a portion of the detached mucous membrane, taking care to turn the adherent surface inwards. 3. Evert a loop of intestine, so that the peritoneal coat may be on the inside: stretch it upon a cylinder, and then agitate it in a cylindrical vessel, so as to float out the valves. The papilla'., or villi, are much more developed in the small intestine than in any other part of the alimentary canal, with the exception of the tongue. Fallopius has the honour of having discovered them. They were well de- scribed by Helvetius, Hewson, and Lieberkuhn, but still more accurately of late by Albert Meckel. When examined by the naked eye and under the microscope, the internal surface of the intestine appears to be roughened by an immense number of prominences or villi (^figs. 157. 159.), resembling very close short grass, or a very hairy caterpillar. In some animals, as in the dog, and especially in the bear, the villi are so numerous and so long, that they in some degree re- semble the filamentous roots of plants. They are found through the whole length of the small intestine, and cover the valvulae confliventes, as well as the intervals between them. They vary in length: according to Lieberkuhn, they are one fifth of a line; their maximum length appears to be about four fifths of a line : and I have even found some in the duodenum, which when extended were a line in length. Their number is very considerable, and attempts have been made to determine it. Lieberkuhn computed them at 500,000. Several Germans have taken up the subject; allowing 4000 to every square inch, by a calculation, the exactness of which I have not verified, there would be a million altogether. I have not observed any well-marked difference as regards the number of the villi, between the commencement and the termination of the small intestine. It appears to me that the number and length of the viUi is much greater in carnivora than in herbivora. The otter has been said to have the largest villi of any animal. Their form varies much. In the majority of animals which I have examined, as the dog, cat, calf, and bear, they are filiform. In the * A. Meckel recommends that the mucus should be removed by plunging the intestine first in an arsenical solution, and then in water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen ; but the continued action of a stream ol" water is far preferable.487 THE INTESTINES. I I 4 human subject they are all lamellar or foliaceous, but with many varieties. In the duodenum they are curved upon themselves, presenting the appearance of a calyx or corolla, and sometimes adhering to each other by their extremities. In the small intestine, properly so called (Jigs. 157.159.), they are rectihnear, floating, cylindrical, conical, clubbed at the end, constricted, and sometimes bent in the middle. In the neighbourhood of ulcerations, they are, as it were, cut off close or truncated, without presenting any alteration in their structure. Structure. Brunner calls them membranous tubes ; Leeuwenhoek regarded them as muscular organs; Helvetius and Hewson considered them to be small valves, an idea which has been revived and carried out more lately by Albert Meckel. This anatomist, who has given representations of the villi in a great number of animals {Journ. Complement, t. vii. p. 209.), regards them as formed of small lamellse, sometimes twisted upon their axes, like the first leaf of a germinating grain of wheat, and sometimes folded into a semi-canal or groove; but he considers that all these varieties may be referred to that of a lamella, broad at the base and narrow at the apex, a fundamental form which may always be demonstrated with the aid of a needle.* Lieberkuhn states, that at the base of each villus there is an ampulla, which opens upon the summit of the villus by a single orifice; and he considers that both the ampulla and the orifice belong to the commencement of the lacteal vessels ; arteries and veins ramify round the ampulla; and each villus has an afferent artery and an efferent vein. According to Mascagni, the villi are composed of an interlacement of bloodvessels and small lymphatics, and are covered by an extremely thin membrane, composed of lymphatics. The fol- lowing are the results of my own observations. Having had occasion to ex- amine a subject in which the lymphatic vessels were filled with tubercular matter, I was able to trace a lymphatic trunk into each villus (vide. Anat. Path. avec planches, liv. 2.), which traversed its entire length. This perfectly agrees with Lieberkuhn's account. In another subject I injected mercury into one of the mesenteric veins, and then above the mercury I forced in a coarse black injection. The mercury and a part of the black injection passed into the cavity of the intestine, and a globule of mercury appeared upon the summits of the villi, which were blackened from the injection. From this I have concluded that the vLUi are perforated at their summits. I shall return to this subject again, f The duodenal glands and follicles. Preparation. Some intestines are not well adapted for the study of the follicles, which, indeed, seem to be entirely * [Many of the villi are certainly cylindrical, and therefore not referrible to the fundamental form described by Albert IVIeckel. In the foetus and young subject they are comparatively broader and flatter, and are connected at their bases so as to form folds having irregular mar- gins. In this stage of their developeraent they resemble the rugae in the intestines of birds and reptiles.] t [The villi contain all tlie elements of the intestinal mucous membrane : no nerves, how- ever, have been actually demonstrated in them. The bloodvessels are numerous, and form a very beautiful capillary network in each villus {3,Jig. 156.). Great differences of opin ion have existed and still exist as to the mode of origin of the lacteals in the intes- tinal villi: the best authorities, how- ever, agree in stating that they do not commence by open orifices. Rudol- phi and A.Meckel considered that they arose by a closed network; Dr. Henlefounda single dilated but closed lacteal in each villosity; and more recently, Krause observed that * - in each villus the lacteal arose by , . . . u 1 , several branches, some of which cnclea m iree but closed extremities, whilst others anastomosed together (2,fis. 156 ) The villi, and. It may be observed here, every portion of the intestinal mucous membrane are covered by a transparent columnar epithelium, consisting of elongated prismatic nucleated cor. The diigram ( arrangement of these upon the surface of a villus, is shown in 156.SPLANCHNOLOGY. wanting in them. Others, again, are very favourable for that purpose. The toUicles are rendered more apparent by plunging the intestine into acidulated water. They must be examined from the internal surface of the mucous membrane, and also from its external surface by removing the serous, muscular, and fibrous coats by which they are covered. In the study of the duodenal glands, this last method of investigation is absolutely necessary. The follicles are generally divided into two kinds, the simple or solitary and the agminaled; to these we shall add the duodenal glands. The duodenal glands. These, properly speaking, are the glands of Brunner. This anatomist, who had already made some curious experiments upon the pancreas, says, that, having partially boiled the duodenum, he observed upon its internal membrane some granular bodies, which he has had figured, resembling the solitary follicles in the neighbouring portion of intestine. To this collection of granules he gave the name of the second pancreas. Further observations have shown, that in the upper half, or upper two thirds of the duodenum, there is a layer of flattened granular bodies, perfectly distinct from each other, however close they may be. This layer must not be confounded with the glanduli- form arrangement of the duodenal villi; it can only be well seen after having removed the three outer coats. These granular bodies are nothing more than small (compound) glands, which, when examined with a powerful lens, present all the characters of the salivary glands. These glands do not cease abruptly, but become few and scattered towards the lower end of the duodenum; so that it is by no means inconsistent to admit that the solitary follicles of the rest of the intestinal canal may be of a similar nature.* The solitary follicles, or glandulce solitarice, are generally known in the present day as the glands of Brunner {Disput. de Gland Duoden. Heidelberg, 1687, 1715), although that anatomist only described the glands or follicles of the duodenum, which he said diminished in number below that portion of the intestine, and disappeared altogether in the jejunum. It is therefore by an extension of the author's meaning that we speak of the glands of Brunner as occupying the termination of the small intestine, the stomach, and even the large intestine. The gland ulae solitarise present the appearance of small rounded granula- tions, like millet seeds, projecting upon the internal surface of the mucous membrane, without any distinct orifice, and covered with villi (^fig. 157.) ; they are found upon the valvulse conniventes, as well as in the spaces between them. Their number is very considerable; so that in certain diseases where they become more prominent than usual, they might be mistaken for a confluent eruption. It is a mistake to say that they diminish in number from the upper towards the lower part of the small intestine, the contrary being nearer to the truth. When examined with the simple microscope, they have appeared to me to be hollow and filled with mucus, f The agminated follicles, or glandular plexuses, are more generally known as the glands of Peyer, although both the solitary and agminated glands were described by that anatomist. Pechlin noticed them under the name of vesicu- larum agmina. "Willis, Glisson, Malpighi, Duvemey, and Wepfer have given more or less complete descriptions of them ; but Peyer {De Glandulis Intes- tinorum. J. C. Peyer, 1667, 1673), when still a young man, and without any Fig. 157. » [According to Dr.Boehm (De Gland.Intestin. Strwct.penitiori), this is not tlie case, tlie compound glands of Brunner not exist- inc below the commencement of the jejunum.] t r Fie 157 is a solitary gland magnified; it is represented, after Boehmf'as a ctorrf vesicle, filled with whitish matter, which con- tains granules smaller than those of mucus. Villi are seen upon the free surface of its capsule, and it is surrounded by the crypts of Lieberkuhn (the mouths of which are indicated by the dark. i snots), which have no communication with the vesicle itsclt (suo also note, p. 490.).]THE INTESTINES. 489 knowledKe of the ^.ork of Pechlin, described and figured them under the title o{ glandular agminatm so accurately as to leave nothing to be desired These agminated glands are arranged in elhptica patches (y?^. 158 ) the long diameter of which corresponds with the Fig. 158. direction of the intestine: they are pierced with holes, or small depressions, so that they have a honeycombed appearance ; and hence has arisen the name of plaques gaufrees, under which I believe I was the first to describe them: they are all situated on the border opposite to that by which the mesentery is attached to the intestine; that is, along the convex border of the intestine, and never along the concave border, nor even upon either side. They are chiefly found toward the end of the small intestiae ; they become more and more scattered as we approach the duodenum, in which, however, Peyer once met with a single patch. Their number varies considerably, twenty, thirty, and even more having been counted. Are they ever entirely wanting ? The difficulty of detecting them in some subjects has led to their being rejected altogether, or considered as the results of a pathological condition; but this opinion is clearly at variance with observation. Again ; these patches are not constant either in situ- ation, form, or dimensions. Sometimes they assume the appearance of bands two or three inches in length {fig. 158.), and sometimes they form circular or irregular clusters. The largest are found near the ileo-csecal valve. It is not rare to find the termin- ation of the small intestine surrounded by a circular patch; in other cases, the patches terminate some inches above the ileo-csecal valve, and their place is supplied by simple follicles. These patches are generally contained in the substance of the mucous mem- brane, to which they give a much greater density, so that in these situations it will bear to be scraped. In some cases they appear to be imbedded in the fibrous coat. They should be examined both from the external and internal sur- faces of the mucous membrane.* When they are filled with their secreted fluid, and are examined by transmitted light, they may be compared to the vesicles in the skin of an orange: this observation may be easily made in the day. They evidently consist of collections of glands, exactly resembling the solitary glands (fig. 159.). Each depression appears to be the orifice of one of the follicles, which are quite independent of each other; so that we sometimes find two or three altered in the middle of a patch, which is otherwise perfectly healthy. Lastly, villi are found upon the patches of the glandulse agmi- nata;: they occupy the intervals between the depressions.f • [Thctir contents arc sometimes tr.insp.irent, and they are then very difficult of detection 1 t [In/g. 159., representing part of a patch of Payer's glands magnified, are seen some of the Fig. 159. IMagnified.SPLANCHNOLOGY. The follicles or corpuscules of Lieberkuhn. Lieberkuhn speaks also of in- numerable, rounded, whitish foUicles which are seen between the villi and ot corpuscules which are visible between these follicles. He calculates that there are eighty follicles for eighteen villi, and eight corpuscules for each lollicle. I am disposed to think that these foUicles and corpuscules, which have never been seen excepting by the microscope, should be referred to those glo- bules which are revealed in all the tissues by the aid of a magnifying power* The vessels and nerves. All the arteries of the small intestine properly so called are branches of the superior mesenteric. They are very numerous Those of the duodenum arise from the hepatic. The branches from the superior mesenteric are remarkable, for the numerous anastomotic loops which they form before reaching the intestine, for their flexuous course within its coats, and for the series of vascular layers formed by them between the peritoneal and muscular, the muscular and fibrous, and the fibrous and mucous coats. The last layer forms a very complicated network, from which the vessels of the mucous membrane are derived. The veins are much larger than the arteries, and present a similar arrangement, except in regard to the flexuous course' which is peculiar to the arteries ; they constitute the superior mesenteric vein,' which is one of the principal branches that contribute to form the vena ports. The lymphatic vessels are of two kinds, viz. lacteals and lymphatics properly so called ; they both enter the numerous lymphatic glands, situated in the mesentery ; those which belong to the duodenum enter the glands above the pancreas. The nerves are derived from the solar plexus. The developemeni of the small intestine will be noticed in conjunction with that of the large intestine. Uses. Chylification, i. e. the transformation of the chyme into chyle, is ef- fected in the duodenal portion of the small intestine. The essential agents of this process are the bile and the pancreatic fluid. In the remainder of the small intestine (the jejunum and ileum), the absorption of the chyle takes place. The numei-ous convolutions, the valvulae conniventes, and the villi, all tend to increase the extent of the absorbing surface. The products of exha- lation and of follicular secretion serve to complete the digestive process. The contents of the bowels are forced along by the shortening of the longitudinal, and the contraction of the circular fibres, the latter producing the vermicular motion of the intestines. The Large Intestine. The large intestine is that part of the alimentary canal which extends from the end of the small intestine (d,fig. 139.) to the anus (i). It commences in the right iliac region {c,fig. 161.), and passes upwards (a) as far as the right hypochondrium; then having reached the liver, it makes a sharp flexure (the right or hepatic flexure), and proceeds transversely (<) from the right to the left side (transverse arch of the colon); in the left hypochondrium, below the spleen, it again makes a sharp bend and becomes vertical (d), (left or splerac flexure). elevated white bodies described by Boelira as resembling the solitary glands, except in not ge- nerally having any villi situated directly upon thera. Each is surrounded by a zone of dark points, the elongated openings of the crypts of Lieberkuhn. Many of these crypts are also seen scattered irregularly between the numerous villi; none of them communicate >with the interior of the whitish bodies, in which, whether solitary or agminated, Boehm could discover no opening, at least not in a healthy human intestine. He considers them, therefore, to be closed vesicles, not follicles. More recently, however, Krause has observed that in the pig's intestine they are occasionally open, independently of disease ; and Dr. Allen Thomson has lately made a similar observation in reference both to the pig and to the human subject.] * [The foUicles, or crypts of Lieberkuhn,jire tubes placed more or less perpendicularly to the surface of the mucous membrane, like those in the stomach, but situated more widely apart; their open mouths are seen scattered over the whole surface of the membrane, or collected around the solitary and agminated glands {figs. Xfil. 159.). The corpuscules (corpora albicmilia), described by the same observer as being situated in the bottom of the crypts, are probably col- lections of desquamated epithelium within them.]THE INTESTINES. 491 In the left iUac region (/) it is twice bent upon itself, Uke the Roman letter S 07,-2 o! it then dips into the pelvis (r), and terminates at *^TheTaree intestine therefore, describes within the abdomen a nearly cora- pleTe ci df"^^^^^^^^^^^ th; mass of convolutions of the ^r - L and it occupies the right and left iUac regions, the right and left lumbar, tiie bLe of eacrhypoch^ndriac, and the adjacent borders of the eP'gast- umbilical regions Although it is much more firmly fixed in its place than the small intestine, and is therefore less liable to displacement, yet it presents some varieties in length and curvature which have a considerable influence over its position. The large intestine is more deeply situated than the smaU in one part of its extent, but in another is at least qmte as superficial From its long course, and from the different relations presented by its dif- ferent parts, it has been divided into the ccecum, the colon, which is itself sub- divided into several parts, and the rectum. Dimensions. The length of the large intestine is four or five feet, and, com- pared with the smaU intestine, is as one to four; but it vanes considerably, rather, it would seem to me, from the effects of repeated distension, than from any original conformation; for it may be easily imagined that the bowel can- not be distended transversely without losing somewhat in length, and that on returning to its former diameter it must be elongated in proportion to the dis- tension it had previously undergone. The large intestine has also generally appeared to me longer in persons advanced in age than in adults. Its caliber or diameter usually exceeds that of the small intestine, but may become so reduced, that the gut resembles a hard cord about the size of the little finger. In other cases it is so large, that it occupies the greatest part of the abdominal cavity: this is observed in tympanitic distension of the large intestine. It is not of uniform caliber throughout, as the following measure- ments will show. The circumference of the caecum, moderately distended, and taken unmediately below the ileo-csecal valve, was found to be eleven inches and there> lines in one subject, and nine inches and a half in another; the ' right colon in the loins and the right half of the arch were eight inches and nine Unes in the first, and five inches some lines in the second subject. The circumference of the left half of the arch of the colon, and of the left lumbar colon was six inches in the first and five inches and a half in the second. The circumference of the sigmoid flexure was five inches and a quarter; that of the rectum was three inches until near its termination, where it presented a dilatation four inches in circumference in one, and five inches in the other subject. It follows, therefore, that the large intestine, like the small, has an infundi- buliform shape; it resembles, indeed, two funnels, the base of the one cor- responding to the caecum, and its apex to the sigmoid flexure, whilst the base of the other is at the dilated portion of the rectum, and its apex is applied to that of the first. It is probable that this infundibuliform arrangement has some reference to the passage of the fsecal matters. It also follows that there is no uniform relation between the diameters of the different portions of the large intestine: thus a very large caecum and ascend- ing colon may co-exist with a small descending colon. In some cases we find in the large intestine considerable dilatations, separated from each other by such constrictions, that the caliber of the corresponding part of the gut is ob- literated. These strangulations from a contraction of the circular fibres are very different from those produced by organic diseases; they probably take place during life, and may account for the affection known as the windy colic. In some chronic diseases, accompanied with diarrhoea, the large intestine, con- tracted and containing no gases, is not as large as the small intestine. The ccBcum. The caecum (e, fig. 139.), so named, because it resembles a cul-de-sac, is the first part of the large intestine. The existence of a caecuin is one of the numerous indications of the line of separation between the largeSPLANCHNOLOGY. and the small intestine. Its upper boundary is altogether arbitrary ; it is de- termined by a horizontal plane intersecting it, immediately above the insertion ot the small intestine. It is single in the human subject, but is double in some species of animals. It is situated ic,fig. 161.) in the right iliac fossa, and oc- cupies It almost entirely. It is one of the most fixed portions of the alimentary canal, for the peritoneum merely passes in front of it, and binds it down into the iliac fossa. It is not, however, so firmly fixed in all subjects ; it is often enveloped by the peritoneum on all sides, and floats, as it were, in the region which it occupies, its capability of motion depending on the looseness of the right lumbar mesocolon. This arrangement of the peritoneum is not necessary, however, to explain the great amount of displacement which the caicom under- goes in certain cases. It is not uncommon to find it in the cavity of the pelvis : it occasionally enters into the formation of hernia;, and, what is somewhat remarkable, it has been at least as frequently found in hemise upon the left as upon the right side. ' Its direction, which is in general the same as that of the ascending colon, is not always Tertical, as may be seen by examining a moderately distended intestine, but it passes obliquely upwards and to the right side, so that it forms with the colon an obtuse angle projecting on the right side ; and I have even seen it form a right angle with the colon. This arrangement, connected with the obliquity of the plane of the iliac fossa, explains why, when its attachments are relaxed, it has less tendency to be displaced towards the right inguinal ring and femoral arch, than to the same parts on the left side. In some subjects, the csecum and its vermiform appendix are applied to the lower part of the small intestine, so that the caecum and the neighbouring part of the colon describe a curve, the concavity of which embraces the lower end of the ileum. In size it is generally larger than the portion of intestine which succeeds it: this perhaps depends less upon its primitive conformation, than upon the ac- cumulation of faecal matters resulting from the inclined position of this intes- tine, and from the direction in which its contents are moved. It may be said as a general rule, that, next to the stomach, the ca;cum is the largest part of the alimentary canal. There are many individual varieties in the length and capacity of this intestine, in which the fsecal matters are liable to be retained. These accumulations occasion great pain; they have been much studied lately, and have been often mistaken for inflammations. The caecum is very slightly developed in carnivora, but, on the other hand, it is very large in herbivora. Figure. The caicum is a sort of rounded ampulla, all the diameters of which are nearly equal; it is also sacculated like the rest of the large intestine. Upon it we observe the commencement of the three longitudinal bands, which I have already noticed: of these the anterior is, in the caecum, twice as broad as either of the two posterior ; some folds of peritoneum loaded with fat, which are called fatty appendages (appendices epiploica); and, lastly, some protu- berances, separated by parallel depressions, an arrangement which exists in the colon also, and is produced by the longitudinal bands. Relations. In front, the caecum is in relation with the abdominal parietes, through which it can be felt when it is distended with gases, or fsecal matters. When the caecum is collapsed, the small intestine is often interposed between it and the parietes of the abdomen. Behind, it rests upon the iliacus muscle, from which it is separated by the lumbo-iliac fascia. The cellular tissue uniting it to this aponeurosis is extremely loose, and therefore offers no opposition to displacement of the intestine. When the peritoneum forms a complete covering for the caecum, that intestine is of course in indirect relation with the iliacus. The vermiform appendix is often tuiTied back behind the CEecimi. On the inside, the caecum receives the small in- testine ; the angle at which they unite (the ileo-cajcal angle) varies much. Sometimes the small intestine is inserted at a right angle; most commonly the angle of incidence is obtuse above, and acute below (^Jig. 160.). Sometimes the493 THE INTESTINES. Ueum instead of passing upwards, is directed downwards, and then the angle nf rHdence is changed. A circular depression indicates the limit between the two intestines.

Upon this surface, to the left and a little behmd, we also find the ileo- cecal valve (a b,fig. 160.), and the orifice (o) of the vermiform appendix {v). The ileo-clcai valve. This is also caUed the valve of Bauhin, from the name of the anatomist to whom its discovery is attributed, although it had been described before his time. To obtain a perfect knowledge of it, it should be examined upon a fresh specimen under water, and also upon an inflated ana dried intestine. . , In a fresh specimen, when viewed from the caecum, it presents the appear- ance of a projecting cushion, oblong fi-om before backwards, and fissured in the same direction. It is a membranous and moveable cushion, and was incorrectly compared by Riolanus to the pyloric ring. It has two lips and two commissures ; the two lips are in contact, except during the passage of the contents of the bowels. Two folds, proceeding from the two commissures, one of which is anterior and the other posterior, are lost upon the corre- sponding surfaces of the intestine. The posterior fold is much longer than the anterior; Morgagni called them the freena of the valve. When viewed from the ileum it presents the appearance of a funnel-shaped cavity directed upwards, and to the right side. In a dried intestine, the ileo-csecal valve is seen to consist of two prominent valvular segments, projecting into the caecum, so as to form an angular ridge. The upper or ileo-colic segment (b,fig. 160.) is horizontal; the lower, or ileo- ccEcal (a), forms an inclined plane of about 45°, and both are parabolic. The upper segment is fixed by its adherent _^ convex border, to the semicircular line, along which the Fig. 160. ^^ /W upper part of the tube of the ileum is united with the ~ colon ; the adherent border of the lower segment, which is also convex, is continuous with the semicircular line of junction between the lower half of the ileum and the caecum. The free borders of the segments are directed towards the right side, and are semilunar ; they are united at their extremities, but in the middle leave between them (between a and b) an opening like a button-hole, which becomes narrower as the intestine is more distended. The diameter of this opening is in proportion to that of the small intestine. The free border of the lower segment is more concave than that of the upper. When examined from the ileum, the valve presents an angular excavation, exactly corresponding to the projecting edge found in the cavity of the large intestine. The lower surface of the upper valvular segment is slightly concave ; the corresponding surface of the lower segment is slightly convex. This double Ueo-csecal valve differs widely from the ring of the pylorus ; it ofiers no obstruction to the passage of the contents of the small into the large intestine; but in ordinary cases it wUl not permit their regurgitation from the latter into the former. The lower or ileo-caecal segment is elevated so as to prevent reflux from the cjecum, and the ileo-colic segment becomes depressed and opposes any return of the contents of the colon. Still, from a great number of experiments which I have performed on this subject, I am satisfied, that both water and air injected into the large intestine most frequently overcome theSPLANCHNOLOGY. diffeienrsuWtf X^'^'' ''^""eh with difierent degrees of facility in or Um^d St? ^" '•eg'^'-g'tation, however, only takes place with gaseous back^ann?h T' ^^''^ a greater degree of consistence cannot pass back and therefore the reflux of fajcal matter is impossible * ^ bv AlhilTf Tf' tte ileo-ceecal valve was perfectly demonstrated a dittpXH • I t .e^^'^Ple and remove the peritoneal coat from a distended intestine, at the point where the ileum enters the large bowel we twi ""''Vf ^'^'^e most distinctly, that the small intestine seems to sink in there; and if by means of careful and gradual force we attempt to disenga-e ^hfr^^Ju^ i"""^^- 'T'^'''''' " ""^y ^« it ^ere, from the colonic lf V,f°f '""^^ ^\'^''^ ^""^ ^ '^"•i t^en, on inspecting the inside of the large intestine, we shall find that the valve has altogether (Usappeared, and that the ileum communicates with the caicum and colon bv a laree aperture. The precise structure of the valve is as foUows : — it is composed of the cir- cular muscular fibres of the Ueum, which are prolonged as far as its free edge + • of the fibrous coat, and of the mucous membrane. A similar fact has been ob- served regarding this mucous membrane to one we have already several times noticed in descnbmg the alimentary canal, viz. a sudden change in its cha- racter opposite the free margin of the valve. That portion of the membrane which lines the surface turned towards the large intestine has aU the cha- racters of the mucous membrane of that bowel, while that lining the surface directed towards the ileum has those of the mucoug membrane of the smaU intestine. The limit between them is generally observed in diseases. The appendix vermiformis. The appendix vermiformis {v, figs. 139.160,161.), so named from its resemblance to an earth-worm, commences at the posterior lower and left portion of the caecum, of which it may be considered an ap- pendage {the cacal appendix) ; it resembles a small, hollow, and very narrow cord (duodecies nascente cob angustior says Haller). In length and in direction it presents much variation : its length is from one to six inches. It is some- what wider at its point of junction with the caecum, than in any other part, and is in general about the diameter of a goose-quill. Its direction is sometimes vertically downwards, sometimes upwards, and often tortuous. I have found it spiral, and at other times contained in the substance of the mesentery, parallel to the ileum, and only free at its extre- mity. In some subjects it is funnel-shaped, widening out to become con- tinuous with the caecum, which, in such cases, is very narrow. Its situation and relations are equally variable. Thus, most commonly, it occupies the right iliac fossa, near the brim of the pelvis : it is attached to the caecum and to the iliac fossa by a triangular or falciform fold of the peritoneum, which extends only to one half of its length, and allows it a greater or less capability of move- ment. It is still more moveable when it is entirely surrounded by the peri- toneum, and has no mesentery. From this it may be conceived, that it may enter into the formation of herniae, and may be twisted around a knuckle of the small intestine so as to cause strangulation. It is often turned back behind the ascending colon, between that intestine and the kidney: in one case of this kind I found the free extremity of the appendix in contact with the lower sur- face of the liver. I have also once seen it turned up behind the lower end of * Nevertheless, if we consider that the large intestine must always be very much distended in order to produce a reflux of gases and liquids, it may be questioned whether the passage of gaseous or liquid matters from the large to the small intestine can take place during life. I have been able to determine the mechanism of the resistance ofTered by the valve from the effects of distension. The two segments are turned back, the lower one upwards, and the upper one downwards; their corresponding surfaces become convex, and they are pressed to- gether the more and more forcibly in proportion to the amount of distension. In some sub- jects distension may be carried so far as to rupture the longitudinal bands, and yet not over- come the obstacle. In most cases the free edge of the lower segment glides from right to left under the upper one, which remains immoveable; and the gas and liquids escape with more or less facility, according to the degree of disturbance in the parts. t [The longitudinal mu.scular fibres and the peritoneal coat pass directly from the small to the large intestine, without entering into the formation of the valve.]THE INTESTINES. 495 „ .

It extends from the cfficum to the rectum, and as we have already seen, there is no line of demarcation between these different parts In the first part of its course it ascends vertically, then becomes trans- verse, next descends verticaUy, and is then curved like the Roman letter S, and becomes continuous with the rectum. From this long course, and also from its direction and numerous relations, the colon has been divided into four portions viz. the ascending or right lumbar colon, the transverse colon or arch of the colon, the descending or left lumbar colon, and the iliac colon or sigmoid flexure Each of these parts requires a separate description, at least with re- sard to its relations. Let us first point out the general form of the colon. The colon presents a sacculated appearance throughout, which gives it some resemblance to a chemical apparatus, consisting of a long series of aludels. The sacculi of the colon are arranged in three longitudinal rows, separated by three muscular bands. Each of these rows presents a succession of enlarge- ments and constrictions, or deep grooves, placed across the length of the in- testine. These enlargements and grooves are produced by the longitudinal bands, which being much shorter than the intestine, cause it to be folded in- wards upon itself at intervals. It follows, therefore, that division of these bands by means of a bistoury, or rather their rupture, from great distension of the gut, should destroy this sacculated appearance, and such, indeed, is the result of the experiment; at the same time, the large intestine becomes twice or three times as long as it was before, and forms a regular cylinder, like the small intestine. An incontestable proof of the relation between the cells of the colon and the muscular bands, is the concurrent absence of both in a great number of animals. Lastly, the three rows of sacculi vary much in different subjects, and also in different parts of the great intestine. The descending colon and the sigmoid flexure have only two rows of sacculi, and consequently two intermediate bands. The sacculi almost entirely disappear in the sigmoid flexure. The ascending or right lumbar colon (a, figs. 155. 161.). This portion of the colon is bounded below by the csecum, and above by the transverse arch, with which it forms a right angle, near the gall bladder. It is more or less firmly held in its place by the peritoneum, which in some subjects merely passes in • [Nevertheless, the structure of the mucous membrane in the two situ.itions is very difTerent (see notes, p. •190. 502.).]SPLANCHNOLOGY. It, and in others forms a fold or lumbar mesocolon. The ascending and descending colon may be included among the most fixed portions of the ali- mentary canal. In front of it are the parietes of the \ abdomen, from which, ex- \ cepting when greatly dis- \ tended, it is separated by \ the convolutions of the , small intestine. Behind, it / is in immediate relation 1 with the quadratus lum- borum and the right kid- ney, no layer of peritoneum intervening. It is united to these parts externally by loose cellular tissue. This relation accounts for the bursting of abscesses of the kidney into the colon, and explains the possibility of reaching the colon in the lumbar region, without wounding the peritoneum. On the left side, advantage has been taken of this fact in attempting to form an artificial anus. On the inside and on the outside it is in relation with the convolutions of the small intestine; and on the inside also with the psoas muscle, and with the second portion of the duodenum. The transverse colon, or arch of the colon. This (0 is the longest portion of the large intestine ; it extends from the ascending to the descending colon, from the right to the left hypochondrium, and generally occupies the adjacent borders of the epigastric and umbilical regions. It is not unfrequently found opposite the umbilicus, and even in the hypogastrium. Its right extremity corresponds to the gall bladder {g), its left is below the spleen (Ji). It de- scribes a curve having its convexity directed forwards, and its concavity back- wards I hence the name, arch of the colon. In some subjects it is two or three times its ordinary length, and hence it presents various inflections. I have seen its middle portion descending as low as the umbilical or hypogastric re- gion, and even reaching the brim of the pelvis: in other cases it descends parallel to, and on the inner side of, the ascending colon, and then passes up- wards again, or it describes curves of different extent. The arch of the colon is supported by a very remarkable fold of peritoneum, called the transverse ■mesocolon, which forms a horizontal septum between the small intestine below, and the stomach, the Uver, and the spleen above. The extent of this fold, which is one of the largest of all those formed by the peritoneum, explains the great freedom of the movements of the transverse colon, which, next to the small intestine, is the part of the alimentary canal most frequently found in hernia. Relations. Above, it has relations with the liver (t), which generally pre- sents a slight depression, corresponding to the angle formed by the ascending and transverse colon; with the gall bladder {g), whence the discolouration of the right extremity of the arch from the bile : it is not rare to find the gallTHE INTESTINES. 497 bladder opening into the colon; with the stomach («), which projects in front of it when distended, but is separated from it by a considerable interval when empty; and lastly, with the lower extremity of the spleen. (Jt) The two an- terior layers of the great omentum, which proceed from the greater curvature of the stomach, pass over the arch of the colon without adhering to it. I have seen a large loop of the arch of the colon interposed between the liver and the diaphragm. Below, the arch of the colon corresponds to the convolutions of the small intestine (^fig. 155.). In front, it corresponds to the parietes of the abdomen, beneath which it may sometimes be felt when distended with gas. It is separated from them by the two anterior layers of the great omentum. The two posterior layers of the great omentum are given off from the middle of its anterior border. Behind, it gives attachment to the transverse meso- colon. The descending or left lumbar colon. The descending colon (d,figs. 155. 161.) so closely resembles the ascending portion, both in situation and relations, that we can only refer to what has been already stated. We must observe, however, that it is more deeply situated above than the ascending colon, and that it is of less size. Advantage has been taken of its immediate relations behind, with the quadratns lumborum, in the operation for artificial anus in cases of imperforate rectum. It is preferred for this purpose to the ascending colon, simply from its proximity to the anus. The iliac portion, or sigmoid flexure, of the colon. The sigmoid flexure of the colon (/, fgs. 155. 161.) is situated in the left iliac fossa, and is continuous below with the rectum. The line of demarcation between it and the descend- ing colon IS determined by the commencement of a fold of peritoneum, called the iliac mesocolon, or rather by the change in the direction of the large in- testine, as it appears to detach itself from the parietes of the abdomen, oppo- site the crest of the ilium. It is continuous with the rectum at the point where it dips mto the pelvis, opposite the left sacro-iliac symphysis. But as It often happens that the lower portion, or even the whole, of the sigmoid flexure is contained in the cavity of the pelvis, it may be understood that such a defanition is not precise. It is retained in its place by a very loose fold of peritoneum, called the iliac mesocolon, and therefore, in some measure, partakes of the mobility of the small intestine. It has been found in almost aU the regions of the abdomen, but especially m the sub-umbilical zone. It has been seen in the umbilical region Its first curvature reaching even to the liver.

There can be no doubt that this double curve of the colon is connected with its uses as a receptacle for fajcal matters. The size of the sigmoid flexure varies considerably. In a case of imper- forate anus in an infant, which lived twenty days, it became enormously dis- tended. Retention of the faeces in the addt seldom causes so proportionally great an accumulation in the sigmoid flexure; the rectum is almost entirely the seat of the accumulation. Relations. The sigmoid flexure corresponds to the abdominal parietes in front. When empty, its relations with the latter are indirect, in consequence of the interposition of some convolutions of the small intestine; when it is distended, they are immediate; and hence we are recommended to make an artificial anus in the sigmoid flexure of the colon, in cases where the rectum is imperforate. It is in contact behind with the iliac fossa, to which it is fixed by the mesocolon: hence it can be easily compressed and explored by the fingers, for the purpose of detecting hardened masses of faeces. In the rest of its circumference it is in relation with the convolutions of the small intestine. The internal surface of the colon. On the internal surface of the colon are seen three longitudinal ridges, corresponding to the three muscular bands on its external surface ; three intermediate rows of sacculi, the concavities of which agree exactly with the protuberances on the external surface; and lastly, nu- merous ridges or incomplete septa, dividing the cells of each row from one another, and improperly called valves; they correspond to the grooves or de- pressions on the external surface. In order to comprehend the arrangement of the cells and the intervening septa, we must examine the large intestme, when moderately distended and dried. If the muscular bands have been previously divided, the cells and septa disappear. The internal saccuU, as well as the external protuberances, vary much m dif- ferent individuals, and even in different parts of the same colon. Thus, there are eeneraUy only two rows in the descending colon and the sigmoid flexure, because there are only two muscular bands in those parts. Sometimes, indeed, there are no cells in the sigmoid flexure. Lastly, the internal surface of the large intestine presents some irregular folds, which are completely effaced by ^''Sr°cJ«m. The rectum (7i i, fig. 139.), so called from its direction, which is generally less flexuous than that of the rest of the intestinal canal, is the last portion of the large intestine, and consequently of the digestive tube. It commences at the base of the sacinim, and termmates at the anus. It is situated in the true pelvis in front of the sacrum and coccyx (r,fig. Ul.; oo fig. 181.). We see then that the alimentary canal, after having abandoned the vertebral column in order to describe its numerous convolutions, is situated at its ter- mination in front of the lower part of that column, just as at its commencement, h i^ applied to the upper part of the same. It is firmly fixed especiaUy below, iw?ft is sSrounded on all sides by cellular tissue, and is also bound down by The super or JSvic fascia. This part of it cannot, therefore, suffer such displace- ments as occur in hernia; bat from its functions as an organ of expulsion the who e effort of the abdominal muscles is concentrated upon it, and it ,s, there- ^^e Sle to displacements of a different kind, viz. to invagination and eversion.

Particular attention should be paid to the direction of this bowel, as an anatomical fact from which practical inductions of the greatest interest may be derived. It is not straight, but is curved both in the antero- posterior and lateral directions. In the antero-postcrior direction it follows the curve of the sacrum and coccyx, to which it is closely applied; it is, therefore, concave in front and convex behind (see fig. 181.). Opposite the apex of the coccyx it bends slightly backwards, so as to terminate about an inch in front of that bone. By this very remarkable inflection, it is separated from the vagina in the female, and from the urethra in the male. The lateral inclination. On the left side of the base of the sacrum, and op- posite the sacro-iliac symphysis, the rectum passes downwards, and to the right side, until it reaches the median line opposite the third piece of the sacrum. It then passes forwards, still in the median line, and forms a slight curve with the preceding portion. It has been frequently said that the lower part of the rectum does not occupy exactly the median line, but deviates a little to the right: this is not unfrequently the case at the lower part of the sacrum, but it always regains its original position before its termination. There are, however, some important varieties in the curvature described by the rectum. Thus, it is not uncommon to see the upper part of the gut twisted like an italic /S before reaching the median line ; and in this case it is difficult to determine whether the twisted portion belongs to the rectum, or to the sigmoid flexure of the colon. In several of the cases of unnatural position of the sigmoid flexure, which I have already mentioned, the rectum com- menced ou the right side of the base of the sacrum, and passed downwards, and towards the left side. In one case, where the sigmoid flexure was in its natural position, the rectum passed almost transversely to the right side, as far as the right sacro-iliac symphysis, and then proceeded very obliquely to the left side. The situation of the upper part of the rectum on the left of the median line, has been often quoted in explanation of the relative frequency of inclinations of the uterus to the right side, and also of the greater or less amount of difficulty in parturition, according as the occiput of the foetus is turned towards the right or the left. Foi-m and size. The rectum is cylindrical, not sacculated, and has no bands like those observed in the other portions of the large intestine. Its external surface is covered with a uniform layer of well-marked, fasciculated, longitu- dinal fibres, which give it some resemblance to the oesophagus. At its com- mencement, its caliber is somewhat smaller than that of the sigmoid flexure, but it gradually increases towards the lower end. Immediately before its ter- mination at the contracted orifice, called the anus, the rectum presents a con- siderable dilatation, or ampulla, capable of acquiring an enormous size ; so that, in certain cases of retention of the fajces, it has been found occupying the entire cavity of the pelvis. Relations. Behind, the rectum corresponds with the left sacro-iliac sym- physis and the curve of the sacrum and coccyx ; it is attached to the sacrum above by means of a fold of peritoneum, called the meso-rectum, and is sepa- rated from the sacrum and the sacro-iliac symphysis by the pyriformis muscle, the sacral plexus of nerves, and the hypogastric vessels. Those portions of the rectum which project laterally beyond the coccyx are in relation with the levator ani muscles, which form a sort of floor for it. In front, the_ rectum is free in its upper portion, but is adherent below ; its relations vary m the two sexes, and are of the greatest importance in a sur- gical point of view. In the male its upper or free portion (o,fig. 181.) corresponds to the poste- rior surface of the bladder (h), from which it is separated, excepting in cases of retention of urine, or of considerable dilatation of the rectum by convolu- tions of the small intestines. Its lower or adherent portion is in immediate relation, m the middle line, with the inferior fundus (bas-fond) of the bladder K K 2 'SOO SPLANCHNOLOGY. at the triangular space intercepted between thevesiculae seminales (s); on each side, it is separated from tlie bladder by these vesicles. The extent to which it is in contact with this part of the bladder varies in different subjects, and according as the bladder and rectum are full or empty. We shall see in another place that the peritoneum (u u) forms a cul-de-sac of variable depth between them. In some subjects the cul-de-sac extends as far as the prostate, so that the whole of the inferior fundus of the bladder is covered by it. In front of the inferior fundus of the bladder the rectum is intimately united to the prostate, (i) In some cases the prostate projects beyoni the rectum, on one or both sides ; in other cases the rectum projects beyond the prostate, on one or other, or both sides, and receives the gland, as it were, in a groove. The rectimi has also relations with the membranous portion of the urethra (c), but on account of its inflection backwards, it is separated from it by a tri- angular space, the base of which is directed downwards and forwards, and the apex upwards and backwards. The practical inferences to be drawn from these relations are these,—that the bladder projects into the rectum in cases of retention of urine ; that the bladder can be explored from the rectum, and may be punctured and cut for the extraction of stone ; that the finger passed into the rectum can assist in the introduction of the catheter, and in examination of the prostate; that the rectum must be emptied before performing the lateral operation for stone ; and lastly, that the membranous portion of the urethra may be opened with- out injuring this bowel. In the female the free portion of the rectimi corresponds with the broad li- gament, the left ovary and Fallopian tube, the uterus, and the vagina. The peritoneum forms a cul-de-sac between the vagina and the rectum, analogous to that already described between the bladder and the rectum in the male, and subject to the same varieties. When the uterus and the rectum are empty, a certain number of convolutions of the small intestine are always interposed between the rectum and the vagina; and therefore, in lacerations of the poste- rior wall of the vagina, the small intestines escape through the wound. The uterus and vagina are not unfrequently found deviating to the left side, while the rectum deviates to the right, and then the free portion of the latter corresponds to the right broad ligament and ovary. Lastly, in retroversion of the uterus, which is so common, the fundus of that organ rests upon the rectum. . ■ j i. The inferior or adherent portion of the rectum is mtimately united to the vagina: hence vaginal cancer frequently extends into the rectum: below, on account of its inflection backwards, it is separated from the vagina in the same way as from the urethra in the male, by a triangular space, the base of which is directed downwards, and forms the perineum of the female. On the sides the free portion of the rectum corresponds to the convolutions of the intestines ; the adherent portion is surrounded by adipose cellular tissue, which is nowhere more clearly intended to fiU up intermediate spaces; the absorption or destruction of this tissue is an important circumstance m dis- eases of the anus. _ , ,, , , u f„i/i„ The internal surface of the rectum is remarkable for some longitudinal tolds, which are obliterated by distension, and somewhat resemble the longitudmal folds of the oesophagus. These folds, which have been inappropriately termed the columnce of the rectum, are intersected by other semi-circular folds also effaced by distension. This internal surface presents, moreover a dilatation corresponding to the enlargement seen from without, immediately above the ^"""structure of the large intestine. The same number of coats exist in the large as in the small intestine, but they present certain peculiarities in arrangement of which Zae are common to the whole bowel, while others exist only m par- ticular parts.501 THE INTESTINES. R K 3 The peritoneal coat. The peritoneum does not, in general, form so complete a covering for the large, as for the small intestine. Moreover, it forms a great number of duplicatures on the surface of the bowel, which usually contain fat, and are called the fatty appendices {appendices epiploic^). They are not con- stant, either in number, size, or length, but are sometimes arranged in regular series. Some of them are so long that they may form the contents of a hernial sac, or may even occasion strangulation, by forming a ring around the intestines; they are seldom entirely absent. They become lessened when the gut is distended, and are elongated by its contraction. They are sometimes loaded with an immense quantity of fat, of which they may be considered re- servoirs. They are found along the whole of the large intestine, including the free portion of the rectum. The peritoneum often envelopes the whole of the caecum; at other times it does not cover it behind. Most commonly it forms a fold, or mesentery, for the vermiform appendix. It only passes in front of the ascending and descending colon, which are always uncovered behind. It invests the whole of the trans- verse arch, excepting a triangular space behind corresponding to the transverse mesocolon, and in another triangular space in front corresponding to the great omentum. It completely surrounds the sigmoid flexure, excepting in a small space behind, corresponding to the iliac mesocolon. Lastly, at the upper part of the rectum, it is arranged in a similar manner, and then merely passes in front of that bowel, the lowest portion of which is entirely devoid of a peritoneal covering, and is surrounded by a large quantity of adipose tissue. From the arrangement of the peritoneum upon the large intestine it follows, that the latter is more favourably circumstanced than the smaU intestine for assuming a large size; and also that it may be penetrated in many places without injuring the peritoneum. The muscular coat. As in the small intestine, this coat consists of a circular and a longitudinal set of fibres. The circular fibres form the deep layer, and are arranged as in the small intestine ; the longitudinal fibres, which constitute the superficial layer, are not disposed equally around the bowel, but are collected into three bands, which we have already noticed. These bands have the pearly appearance of liga- ments when seen through the peritoneal covering *; they are continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the appendix vermiformis. The anterior is the largest; it becomes inferior along the arch of the colon, and again anterior upon the descending colon and sigmoid flexure, spreading out upon the latter. Of the posterior bands which are narrower, one is external and the other in- ternal ; they become superior on the arch of the colon, and again posterior upon the descending colon and sigmoid flexure, upon the latter of which they are often blended into one. I have already said that these bands, being not more than one third, or at most one half the length of the large intestine, occa- sion Its puckering, and arrangement into sacculi and intervening depression^ The muscular coat is remarkably modified in the rectum. In the sigmoid flexure the longitudmal fibres become scattered, and at its termination sur- round the whole intestine ; but this arrangement exists more particularly in the rectum, where they present the appearance of thick fasciculi forming an un- interrupted covering (r, fig. 161.). The deep or circular layer of the rectum IS much thicker than that of any other part of the alimentary canal, excepting the oesophagus; it may be separated into distinct rings, the lowest of which is so distinct that it has been described as a particular muscle, under the name of the sphincter mternus. It is arranged in precisely the same way as the cor- responding coat of the oesophagus, but is not so thick : this difi'erence depends upon the uses of the two canals, the oesophagus being intended to convey the food rapidly downwards, while the rectum is assisted by the abdominal muscles! strli«^Irrare7oun!/:r ' °' '^^t"™ ^0">o transverselySPLANCHNOLOGY. 502 "When the rectum is empty it coutracts upon itself like the oesophagus, and its walls are in contact. The fibrous coat of the large intestine offers no peculiar characters. The mucous coat of the large intestine has no valves: the semilunar crests, or ridges which separate the cells of the colon, are formed by all the coats. The irregular folds or wrinkles observed on this membrane are completely effaced by distension. The mucous membrane is not unfrequently protruded through the muscular fibres, so as to form small sacs having narrow necks, and containing masses of indurated faeces. At first sight such sacs resemble a varix. They are very common in the aged, and are probably the result of habitual constipation. When examined with the microscope and under water, in the same manner as the mucous membrane of the small intestine, the inner surface of the large intestine is seen to have no vUli, but we find exactly the same appearance as in the mucous membrane of the stomach, viz. an alveolar or honeycomb arrange- ment. * The openings or pores of this mucous membrane are innumerable; and supposing that they Eissist both in exhalation and absorption, it may be conceived with what rapidity these processes must be carried on in the large intestine. It is also studded with a number of follicles (tanquam stellae firma- menti, Peyer), which are depressed and perforated in the centre *, and in a great number of subjects, especially in the old, have a black colour. These follicles are never collected into patches, as in the small intestine, but are al- ways solitary. They are often inflamed, though the rest of the membrane is healthy. It is easy then to distinguish the large from the small intestine, simply from the characters of its mucous membrane. The limit between the two is at the free margin of the ileo-csecal valve; all preceding this has the characters of the mucous lining of the small, all that comes after, of that of the large in- testine. We find dense patches of follicles in the vermiform appendix, the whole of which is sometimes lined with them. The mucous membrane is more loosely united to the fibrous coat in the rectum than in any other part of the large intestine. This looseness is most marked at its lower part, and hence a protrusion of this membrane only may occur, as in the oesophagus; and this must be carefully distinguished from prolapsus of the entire rectum. I should also remark that the capillary veins are much developed at the lower part of the rectum, and, when much larger than usual, constitute what are called hsemorrhoidal tumours. Vessels and nerves. The arteries of the caecum, the vermiform appendix, the ascending colon, and the right half of the arch, are supplied by the superior mesenteric; the rest of the colon and the rectum receive blood from the in- ferior mesenteric. The rectum also receives a branch from the internal iliac, called the middle hsemorrhoidal, and a branch from the internal pudic, called the inferior hsemorrhoidal. Some small ramifications are also furnished to the great intestine by the gastro-epiploic, splenic, capsular, and spennatic arteries. The recttmi exceeds all other parts of the large intestine in the Pig 162 * [In the stomach this character is due to the presence of the al- veoli, in the bottom of which the perpendicular tubuli open. In the large intestine, however, there are no pits ; but the alveolar appearance is produced by the openings of numerous tubes, ana- logous in form and direction to the tubuli of the stomach, and to the crjrpts of Lieberkuhn in the small intestine. The follicles of the large intestine difler from the solitarj-glands of the jejunum and ileum, in being always open. Each follicle is much dilated below, but has a narrow orifice.

The word anus, borrowed from the Latm, sigmfies the lower orifice of the alimentary canal (the anal orifice); it is a narrow but dilatable opening, through which the faeces are expeUed. • . ^ It is situated in the median line, about an inch in front of the point of the coccyx, at the back part of the perineum, between the tuberosities of the ischium, and at the bottom of the fissure between the buttocks. The skin around the borders of this orifice, which is constantly closed, contains a great number of sebaceous follicles, and is covered with hair m the male ; it passes deeply into the orifice to become continuous with the mucous membrane, and presents a great number of radiated folds, which are efi'aced durmg dilatation. The point at which it becomes continuous with the mucous membrane is de- serving of notice ; it is within the rectum, at the distance of some hnes from the anus properly so called, and is marked by a waved line, which forms a series of arches or festoons having their concavities directed upwards. Some- times there are small pouches in the situation of these arches, opening up- wards. From the angles at which the arches unite, some mucous folds pro- ceed, and small foreign bodies detached from the faces ai-e often retamed in the culs-de-sac, and become the causes of fistulse. Structure of the anus. The anus, intended as it is to prevent the revolting inconvenience of a constant and involuntary escape of the fa3ces, consists essentially of a sphincter muscle, which is antagonised not only by the proper dilator, viz. the levator ani, with which I connect the ischio-coccygeus, but also by the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles. The absence of a sphincter is the great evil of every artificial anus. A fourth muscle, the transversalis perinei, must also be included among the muscles of the anus. The skin and the mucous membrane which cover these muscles are remark- able for the great developement of the erectile tissue, which forms the basis of all tegumentary membranes. The terminal branches of the hEemorrhoidal arteries are extended upon this portion of the skin and mucous membrane. From this erectile and therefore vascular tissue arise a great number of winding, twisted, and plexiform veins, which form the lowest roots of the vena porta;. A considerable number of cerebro-spinal and ganglionic nerves, derived from the sacral plexus and the hypogastric nervous centre, are dis- tributed around this orifice. Lastly, there are mucous crypts, or rather glands, a vestige of the highly developed glandular organ found in some animals. Muscles of the anus. We now proceed to the description of the muscles of the anus, which are six in number, viz. two single muscles, the sphincter and the transversalis perinei; and two pairs, the leva tores ani and the ischio-coccygei, which in fact form but one muscle. The sphincter internus of authors is nothing more than the last ring of the circular fibres of the rectum. The Sphincter Ani. Dissection.

It is not sufficient to 10we Van o^Th "'^S P^j^^r; the adipose tissue which surrounds tS lower pait of the rectum should be removed on each side. It is weU to stuff me ^wer part of the rectum preparatory to this dissection, as weU as that of the muscles of the penneum. The sphincter ani (a, fig. 163.) is an orbicular muscle situated around the lower end of the rectum. It is not a simple ring, but a muscular zone of nearly an inch in width. Its form is an ellipse, much elongated from before backwards, and terminating in a point in front and behind. The fibres which constitute the lower- most ring of the muscle arise from the subcutaneous cel- lular tissue in front of the coccyx, in the same manner as other cutaneous muscles; those which form the upper „, . . ' rings arise from a sort of hbrous tissue given off from the point of the coccyx. From these points the fleshy fibres proceed forwards, and form a semi-ellipse on each side, composed of parallel and superimposed muscular rings, which terminate in front of the anus m the following manner,—the lower rings in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, the upper rings in the sort of fibrous raphe, which gives origin to the bulbo-cavernosus. BelatioTts. The internal surface of the sphincter embraces the lower part of the rectum, the lowest circular fibres of which are seen within the sphincter, and are distinguished from it by their paleness. They constitute the internal sphincter. Its external surface is in relation with the adipose tissue of the pelvis. Its upper border is continuous with the antero-posterior fibres of the levator ani; so that it is very difficult to establish the limit between them. Its inferior border projects a little below the lowest annular fibres of the rectum, and only adheres to the skin by loose cellular tissue, which is con- tinuous with the dartos. Action. It is a constrictor of the anus. The contraction of the body of the muscle closes the lower part of the rectum ; the constriction produced by the inferior ring occurs below that bowel. The Transversus Perinei. Dissection. Remove with care the subcutaneous cellular tissue in front and upon the sides of the anus. The transversus perinei (6) is situated almost transversely in front of the anus. It arises from the internal lip of the tuberosity of the ischium, imme- diately above the ischio-cavernosus (^erector penis), by a broad and thin tendon, which is soon succeeded by fleshy fibres. These pass inwards and a little forwards, on to the anterior surface of the rectum, where they are usually de- scribed as becoming blended with those of the opposite side in a fibrous raphe, common both to the transversi, the sphincter, and the bulbo-cavernosi (accele- ratores urince). This does not appear to me to be the exact termination. I have seen this muscle evidently continuous with that of the opposite side, after having traversed the anterior extremity of the sphincter. According to this, the two transversi would constitute a single muscle, forming a half ring, the concavity of which being directed backwards would embrace the anterior part of the rectum, an arrangement well calculated to assist in expulsion of the faeces.THE INTESTINES. 505 Relations. This muscle is placed at the boundary between the Mial and perineal regions. It forms the posterior side of a triangle, of which the outer side is fon^ed by the ischio-cavernosus (c), and the inner by the bulbo-caver- nosus. (rf) It is subcutaneous excepting in the median hne, and is m relation above with the levator ani. . . Action. It tends to compress and force the anterior against the posterior surface of the rectum, which we shall see is pushed forwards by the levator ani. It therefore assists powerfully in defaecation. The Ischio-eoccygeus and Levator Ani. Dissection. These muscles must be studied both from the perineum and ^ from the interior of the pelvis. In the perineum : remove the adipose tissue, which occupies the interval between the rectum and the obturator internus ; in order to expose the whole of the ischio-coccygeus, cut the lower edge of the gluteus maximus, and carefully divide the great and small sacro-sciatic ligaments. In the pelvis: remove the peritoneum lining the sides of that ca- vity ; remove the superior pelvic fascia, which covers these muscles, and trace them very carefully backwards and upon the sides of the rectum, the bladder, and the prostate gland. The ischio-coccygeus and the levator ani constitute the floor of the pelvis. They form an uninterrupted muscular plane, from the lower border of the py- riformis muscle to the arch of the pubes. The ischio-coccygeus includes that portion which is inserted into the sides of the coccyx, the remainder is the levator ani. The Ischio-coccygeus, or Coccygeus. This is a flat, triangular, or rather a radiated muscl^ (o), situated at the lower part of the pelvis, in front of the sacro-sciatic ligaments. It arises from the sides and summit of the spine of the ischium, from the anterior surface of the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament, and often from the posterior part of the pelvic fascia; it passes in a radiated manner to the border of the coccyx and the lower part of the border of the sacrum. AU these attachments are effected by aponeurotic fibres, to which the fleshy fibres succeed. In this respect its structure has considerable analogy with that of the intercostal muscles, the tendinous portion exceeding the muscular. jRelations. Its upper surface io,fig. 111.) is slightly concave, and corresponds to the rectum ; its lower surface (^fig. 163.) is slightly convex, and is in relation with the sacro-sciatic ligaments and the glutasus maximus; its posterior margin is applied to the lower border of the pyriformis ; its anterior margin is continuous, without any line of demarcation, with the posterior margin of the levator ani (n), from which muscle it can be distinguished merely by its tendinous struc- ture. Action. It assists in forming the floor of the pelvis. It tends to draw the coccyx to its own side : when the muscles of both sides act together, the coccyx is fixed, and cannot be thrown backwards. It acts, therefore, in defaecation. The name levator coccygis, which was given to it by Morgagni, is altogether in- applicable. The Levator Ani. This muscle (n), so called from one of its chief uses, is situated in the cavity of the pelvis, and with its fellow forms a sort of muscular floor, which in many respects resembles that formed by the diaphragm. It is thin, curved, and quadrilateral, nan-ow in front and broad behind. It arises, hy its fixed or upper attachments, in front, from the pubis at the side of and sometimes even from the symphysis; behind, from the anterior border of the spine of the ischium, and in the interval between these extreme points from the upper part of the obturator foramen, and from the brim of the pelvis.506 SPLANCHNOLOGY. Its moveable attachvwnts are to the side of the prostate, the bladder and the rectum, to the point of the coccyx, and to the fibrous raphe extending from that point to the sphincter. The fibres arising from the symphysis pubis are concealed by the pubio-prostatic ligament * : they are few in number, short, and directed inwards, backwards, and downwards, to form a bundle (tha pronlalic), ■which was described by Santorini as the levator proslutce, and by Winslow as le prostatique superieur. The fibres arising from the spine of the ischium are blended at their origin with those of the coccygeus, and pass transversely in- wards to the point of the coccyx. The origins from the upper part of the oh- tui-ator foramen and from the brim of the pelvis take place by means of the pelvic aponeurosis, which divides and receives the muscle between its two layers (i. e. the superior pelvic and the obturator fascisB). These fibres, the hindermost of which are the longest, all pass inwards, describe a curve having its concavity directed upwards, and are divided into the vesical, anal, and prcE-coccygeal. The vesical fibres pass upon the sides of the inferior fundus (bas-fond) of the bladder. I have never seen them terminate on the vesiculffi seminales. The anal fibres having reached the sides of the rectum, above the sphincter, pass backwards, and meet behind the bowel. They constitute a half ring on each side, prolonging the sphincter upwards without any distinct line of demarcation. The prce-coccygeal fibres are directed backwards, and form a thick fleshy layer, occupying the interval between the coccyx and the sphincter, and completing the lower wall or floor of the pelvis. In the female there are also vaginal fibres. Relations. Its upper or internal surface is covered by the superior pelvic fascia, which separates it from the peritoneum and the organs contained in the pelvis. The obturator fascia intervenes between its lower or external sur- face and the internal obturator muscle, from which it is separated below by a large triangular space, narrow above and broad below, and fiUed with adipose tissue. Its posterior part is in relation with the glutaius. Action. It serves as a muscular floor for the pelvis. It raises the prostate, the inferior fundus of the bladder and the anus, and counteracts the effect of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles during violent exertions. It assists powerfully in the expulsion of the urine, the seminal fluid, and the faeces. As the largest portion of the muscle occupies the sides and the back of the rectimi, its especial use is to expel the contents of that bowel: this is efiected by the prse-coccygeal fibres of both muscles elevating the rectum, and by their anal fibres drawing it forwards and upwards, and compressing it on the sides. Functions of the large intestine. In the large intestine, the alimentary substances acquire the odour and all the other characters of the faeces; any remaining nutritious matter or chyle, which they may contain, is absorbed, and they be- come hardened and moulded in the cells of the colon. Absorption is suffici- ently active in the large intestine, to enable life to be supported for a consi- derable period by means of nutritive enemata, in persons who cannot receive food into the stomach. The large intestine acts also as a reservoir; its long course, its curvatures, and its easily yielding character, enable it to contain a great quantity of matter, and prevent the inconvenience of constant deffecation. The appendix vermiformis has no use in man ; it is merely the trace of a largely developed intestine in herbivorous animals. The rectum is the final reservoir, and one of the agents in the expulsion of the fajces, the presence of which gives rise to a sensation that informs us of the necessity for evacuating them. The sphincter, in general, opposes this evacuation, until it is determined upon by the wiU. The expulsion is effected by the action of the rectum, assisted by the diaphragm and the abdommal muscles. *n e bv tlie anterior folds of the recto-vesical fascia, from wliicii the fibres in question partly arise, and by which t\wy are separated from the levator aui: the posterior layer of the triangular ligament is in relation with tlieni in front.]507 THE INTESTINES. Developement of the Intestinal Canal. The developement of the intestinal canal offers two f^'^i^f^l'^^'.^^f^^^- tion viz the relations existing between it and that portion of the foeta rnem- Ses, eaUed the vesicula umbilicalis; and the developement of the canal itself, "tS::nc'efo\tfir1to^^^^ the anatomy of the. human fcBtus is stiU in- volved in much obscurity, authorities being divided m opinion on the subject Without entering here into a discussion which belongs to a higher department of anatomy, I would observe that the principal arguments adduced by those who admit the communication between the intestmal canal and the vesicula umbiUcalis, are drawn from analogy, and especially from what occurs in ovi- parous animals, whose viteUine membrane is regarded as analogous to the umbiUcal vesicle, and in which the most evident communication exists at all stages of foetal existence. . I would observe, also, that these same anatomists are not agreed respecting the point at which this communication occurs. According to Oken, it is at the junction of the small with the large intestine * : according to Meckel, it is at the lower part of the small intestine, and the diverticula so frequently observed in this place are vestiges of the canal of communication. The last named anatomist, after having discussed all the arguments on either side of the question, concludes thus : —" I think, then, that we must at present admit a continuity of substance between the umbilical vesicle and the intestinal canal, without pretending to decide whether the cavities of these two organs open into each other." {Manual d'Anatomie, torn. iii. p. 416. trad, par MM. Jourdan et Breschet.) But the communication of the cavities is evidently the entire question. The arguments of those who deny the existence of a communication in the human foetus and mammalia are founded upon direct observation. I must say with Emmert, Cuvier, and others, that I have never detected this commu- nication ; and though I am far from denying it altogether, yet I consider that facts are still wanting to prove its existence.f The developement of the intestinal canal itself presents, besides some ques- tions yet undetermined, certain positive facts, concerning which there can be no dispute. One of the undetermined questions relates to the mode in which the intestine is formed. Is the digestive tube originally an oblong vesicle, which becomes elongated, at the same time, at both its cephalic and its coccy- geal extremities, both being at first imperforate, but afterwards opening so as to form the mouth and anus ? Does it at first resemble a groove open in front, as Wolf has shown to be the case in birds; or is it developed from two lateral halves, subsequently united together according to the opinion of M. Serres ? Is the intestinal canal formed from one, or from several centres of develope- ment? Is it developed from several pieces, which afterwards meet each other, so to speak ? and are any grounds for this opinion afforded by the absence of different portions of the canal in acephalous monsters, or the occasional exist- ence of septa in different parts of its extent ? I think not. Upon the whole, these microscopical investigations into the first traces of the developement of organs, are still involved in great obscurity ; and I must say that, whenever I have been able to discern the intestinal canal, it has appeared to me to form a complete cylinder.| Another question, which yet remains undetermined, relates to the situation of the intestine in the early periods of intra-uterine existence. It is at first situated, as some authors * Ttie vermiform appendix and the ceecum are the remains of this communication, according to Oken. * t [Tlie communication has been distinctly seen and described by Dr. Allen Thomson. (EUin Med. and Suri; Jotirn. c\\. p. 132.)] t [In the ovum, No. II., described by Dr. A. Thomson (.loc. cil.), the future alimentary canal has the form of a groove.]SPLANCHNOLOGY. believe, in front of the vertebral column; or rather, as others imaffine, in that portion of the cord which is next the umbilicus. ^ Embryologists agree in stating that, in the earliest periods of its develope- nient, the mtestinal canal is not contained in the abdominal cavity, but onlv Its two extremities; all the intermediate part, i. e. almost the whole of the canal, is situated within the umbiUcal cord, which at that time is very con- siderably enlarged. The whole intestinal canal is not included in the cavity of the abdomen until towards the middle of the third month. This fact is quoted in explanation of congenital umbilical hernia, which would be considered merely an arrest of developement. I must here remark that this situation of the intestines, in a cavity formed within the umbilical cord, does not seem to me to have been clearly established; that there are a great number of cases where no such arrangement exists; that in other cases there is only a loop of the intestine in the substance of the cord; and lastly that the cases in which such an arrangement has been observed, if not ex- amples of actual disease, may at least be regarded as instances in which the developement of the anterior wall of the abdomen had been retarded.* Dimensions of the intestinal canal The earlier the period of developement, the shorter and narrower is the intestinal canal. Its length at first appears to correspond to that of the vertebral column, a relation which is natural and permanent in a great number of the lower animals. The canal soon becomes flexuous, and its vrindings become more numerous in proportion as it increases in length. From the third to the fourth month, its curves are analogous to those which it subsequently describes : at the sixth month, the due proportion between the different parts of the canal is established. At the earlier periods, the small intestine has a much greater caliber in proportion to the large in- testine, than it afterwards presents; and, on the other hand, the large intestine is relatively longer than at subsequent periods. The division into the large and the small intestines does not exist at first. There is no ileo-csecal valve, no cajcum, and no appendix vermiformis; but these three means of distinction appear simultaneously from the second to the third month.f The csecum and the vermiform appendix are not distinct from each other, but present the appearance of a sort of funnel. The appendix, though at first small, is gradually developed, and becomes proportionally greater than it is afterwards ; its caliber is nearly one half that of the small intestine. If it be not quite correct to say with Haller, that the csecum does not exist in the fcetus, yet it must be admitted that, at this period of existence, it is nothing more than the expanded base of the vermiform appendix; and the developement which it acquires after birth may, to a certain degree, be regarded as the mechanical effect of the weight of the fsecal matters in di- lating its cells. The anterior cells of the CiECum, on account of its vertical position, undergo a relatively greater amoimt of dilatation ; and from this the vermiform appendix, which corresponded at first to the centre of the lower end of the csecum, is turned backwards, inwards, and to the left side towards the ileum. The csecum and the appendix do not occupy the right iliac fossa until the fourth or fifth month ; before that time they are situated in the neighbourhood of the umbilicus. For the first four or five months of intra- uterine life, the large intestine is not sacculated; so that its external surface is exactly similar to that of the small intestine, the only means of distinguishing one from the other being the situation of the vermiform appendix. About the fil'th month, according to Morgagni, the three longitudinal depressions, and the transverse folds or depressions and intermediate protuberances, make their * [The presence of a portion of the intestinal canal within the umbilical cord, at some period of developement, is constant not only in man but in several quadrupeds, and cannot be merely accidental.] t Haller, who in this and many otlier passages seems to have foreseen the law of unity of organisation, says, "Eadem primordialis liominis fere fabricu est qua; quadrupedum."

These characters are first observed in the trans- verse arch of the colon. . . , . i-i * The valvulse conniventes of the smaU intestine do not appear until about the seventh month, and they are very slightly developed at birth. It is not uninteresting to remark, that the condition of the fcBtus, in th.s respect re- sembles that of animals, ^hich never have valvulae conniventes. The viUi however, can be observed as early as the third month. Meckel considers that they are developed from folds of the mucous membrane, the surfaces of which become notched. At the same period, according to that author, vilh are very apparent in the large intestine ; but, after the seventh month, they dimmish in number and size, while those of the small intestine remain, even if they do not increase. At first it is impossible to distinguish the several coats of the intestine: the serous and the mucous membrane can alone be recognised. The intestine is perfectly transparent. . , , .i. The threat omentum first appears during the third month, along the convex edo-e of the stomach, like a smaU and very thin border. Fat is never found within it before birth; nor are the appendices epiploiccE developed until after that event. . At birth, the intestinal canal presents the same characters as it afterwards possesses. The small intestine is already provided with rudimentary valvule conniventes, with well marked villi, and with very evident solitary and ag- minated glands. The large intestine, which is much developed, is distended with meconium ; the csecum is shorter than it afterwards becomes, the vermi- form appendix is larger, and the ileo-caecal valve has the same appearance as in the adult. The mucous membrane of the large intestine is already cha- racterised by its solitary follicles and alveolar appearance. In the large intestine of the foetus we find, instead of faecal matter, a thick, viscid, inodorous, and dark green substance, which fills the bowel more or less completely. This is the meconium, so called from the Greek word fj-i^Kcov a poppy, because it bears some resemblance in colour and consistence to the juice of that plant. Its quantity increases towards the period of birth. The time at which it first appears has not been ascertained : I have found it in foetuses of four or four and a half months, but then it only occupied the rectum. From the seventh to the ninth month it is accumulated in the sigmoid flexure, and diminishes in quantity towards the ileo-csecal valve. The vermiform ap- pendix is not unfrequently found distended with this matter. The small in- testine also contains a mucous substance; but it is less abundant and less viscid, sometimes colourless, and sometimes yellowish or greenish. The changes which take place in the intestinal canal after birth, affecting its caliber, its situation, and its length, appear to me to depend upon its be Jijr more or less distended with gas and fsecal matters, and on its being displaced in consequence of adhesions, increase of size, or displacement of other organs I have proved that in females who have had children, the intestines present more varieties in situation than in males. We may add, that these differences in position are much more frequently observed in the large than in the small intestine. APPENDAGES OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. The liver and its excretory apparatus. — The Pancreas. — The Spleen. The appendages of the sub-diaphragmatic portion of the alimentary canal are the liver and pancreas, two glandular organs which pour their secretions into the duodenum, and the spleen, which may be regarded as an appendage of the liver.510 SPLANCHNOLOGY. The Liver. The liver (tl'fiijs. 155. 161.) is a glandular organ intended for the secretion ot bile. Moreover, it is to this organ that the blood of the abdominal venous system is earned m the adult, and that of two systems of veins in the foetus It IS situated near the duodenum, L e. the portion of the intestinal canal into which the bile is poured ; it occupies the whole of the right hypochondrium advances into the epigastrium, and even sUghtly into the left hypochondrium' It IS protected by the seven or eight lower ribs on the right side, which defend It from external violence; and it is separated from the thoracic organs by the diaphragm. It is supported by folds of the peritoneum connecting it with the diaphragm, and regarded as suspensory Ugaments ; by the stomach and in- testines, which form a sort of elastic cushion for it; and by the vena cava, which is intimately adherent to it. These means of support and attachment allow of slight movements to and fro, and even of certain changes of position, not amounting to displacement. Thus it is depressed during inspiration, and'pro- jects a httle below the edges of the costal cartUages; it is raised during ex- piration ; it sinks slightly downwards during the erect posture, and backwards, or in the direction in which its own weight would drag it, according to the way in which the body lies during the horizontal position ; it is pushed up- wards by tumours in the abdomen, and downwards by effusions in the chest. The disturbed sleep to which many individuals are subject when lying upon the left side, is attributed to the pressure of the liver upon the stomach; and to the dragging of the liver upon the diaphragm has been ascribed the sensation of hunger, as well as the relief of that feeling produced by tying something tight around the abdomen. These notions are, however, purely hypothetical; and generally, in solving such questions, the exact state of ful- ness of the abdomen, and of the mutual action and reaction of the abdominal parietes and viscera, has not been sufficiently taken into account. True dis- placements of the liver are very rare, and hepatocele (hernia of the liver) is the result of an imperfect developement of the walls of the abdomen. Size. The liver is the largest and heaviest of all the organs of the body ; and indeed, in the human subject, it exceeds in weight and in size aU the other glands together. It is not true, as the ancients declared, that the liver is larger in man than in any other animaL But the opinion maintained by many natu- ralists, that there is, in the animal series, an inverse ratio between the size of the liver and the developement of the respiratory organs, so that this organ is much larger in reptiles and fishes, whose respiration is slight, than in birds and mammalia, which respire vigorously, is not altogether devoid of foundation. The liver weighs from three to four pounds, thus forming one thirty-sixth of the whole weight of the body according to Bartholin, and one twenty-fifth ac- cording to others. Its longest diameter, the transverse, is from ten to twelve inches ; its antero-posterior diameter is from six to seven inches; and its vertical diameter in the thickest part from four to five. These dimensions are extremely variable, but are always inversely proportional to each other. In a great many livers the transverse diameter is the shorter, and the vertical the longer. Few organs present a greater variation in size and form in different in- dividuals than the liver. I am certain that the relative proportion between different livers may be as much as one to three, in the absence of all disease. It is pretty generally believed, that a large liver occasions such modifications in the whole system, as will give rise to a particular temperament. But it may be doubted whether there is any proof, that the bilious and melancholic tem- peraments, are speciaOy accompanied by a large liver, or that hypochondriasis in particular is the result of a predominance of that organ.* Anatomical evi- * Hippocrates sometimes gave the name of hypochondria to tlic liver, and hence no doubt the term hypochondriac.THE LIVER. 511 dence affords but little support to such ideas, which are rather the result of preconeerved notions respecting tl,e functions of the liver and the influence of thP hilp than the fruit of positive observations.

I shaU point out the influence of age under the head of develope- ment We shaU then see that the liver is largest during mtra-uterme lite; and that it is proportionally larger at periods nearer to that of conception : hence it arises that the greatest relative size of the liver is coincident with the least amount of biliary secretion; and we may therefore conclude, that this organ has some other use besides that of secreting bile. When diseased, the liver has been found to weigh from thirty to forty pounds, but the enormous size in these cases is almost invariably owmg to the developement of accidental tissues. Some cases, however, have been recorded, of simple hypertrophy of the liver without any organic disease, in which the size acquired was prodigious. In opposition to this we must notice the state of atrophy * in which the liver is shrivelled, and not more than a third, fourth, or even a sixth of the natural size. In one subject in which the umbilical vein remained pervious, and the subcutaneous abdominal veins were dilated and varicose, the liver weighed only about half a pound. The specific gravity of the liver is, to that of water, as fifteen to ten. Figure. The liver is a single and asymmetrical organ, of such an irregular form as to defy description. We shall compare it, with Glisson, to a segment of an ovoid, cut obliquely lengthwise, thick at its right extremity, and pro- gressively diminishing towards the left, which terminates in a tongue. Its shape is represented by the sort of mould formed by the right half of the diaphragm, and bounded below by an oblique plane directed upwards, and to the left side (fig. 161.). No organ is more exactly moulded upon the surrounding parts, nor under- goes changes in form with greater impunity, either from external pressure, or from that exercised upon it by other viscera: it may even be said to be, as it were, ductile or malleable under the influence of a slowly-exerted pressure. The injurious effects of very tight lacing are chiefly experienced by the liver. A circular constriction and a fibrous thickening of this organ opposite the base of the thorax, sometimes afford evidence of this compression; its transverse and antero-posterior diameters become diminished, and its vertical diameter is increased ; it projects more or less below the base of the thorax, descends as low down as the right iliac fossa, and may even touch the brim of the pelvis without any structural lesion. In these cases its upper surface becomes ante- rior, and its lower surface posterior. There are but few female subjects without some deformity of the liver; and therefore the type of the organ must be sought for in the male, f No practical conclusions then can be derived from the shape of the liver ; and I am almost inclined to agree with Vesalius in saying, that it has no determinate form, but accommodates itself to the surrounding parts. In a few rare ex- ceptions we find the human liver divided into lobules by deep fissures, as it is in a great number of animals. The errors which have for a long time ex- isted upon this subject, even since the time of Vesalius, arise from a blind re- * We cannot admit the proposition of Soemmering,—" Quo sanior lioino, eo minus ejus liepav est." t Scemmcring, without giving any reason, says, " In scxu masculo magis, minus infeminco costis istis ledum latet."

The liver presents for consideration a superior or convex surface, an infe- rior or plane surface, an anterior and a posterior border, a base, and a sum- mit. The superior surface {pars gibba) is convex and smooth, and in contact with the diaphragm, which is moulded exactly upon it: this convexity is not regular, but much greater on the right than on the left side, where the sur- face is almost flat {fig. 161.). This surface is dirided into two unequal parts (Z /) by a falciform fold of peritoneum (1 to 2), called the falciform or sus- pensory ligament of the liver, which seems to be principally intended to protect the umbilical vein, and which is never put upon the stretch during the natural state of fulness of the abdomen. One or more fissures are not unfrequently found running from before backwards upon the upper surface of the liver; and I am sure that these fissures, in explanation of which Glisson and Femel have advanced some very singular opinions, are due, at least in some cases, to the pressure of projecting folds of the diaphragm. The falciform ligament forms the line of separation between the right (/') and the left {t) lobes, a purely nominal distinction, which results from the old habit of admitting several lobes in the liver, and is retained here only for the sake of conformity to custom. The portion of the liver situated to the left of the suspensory ligament is always smaller than that upon the right. The convex surface of the liver is bounded behind by the reflection of the peritoneum upon it from the diaphragm. It is separated by the diaphragm from the heart, the ribs, and the base of the right lung. Its relations with the base of the right lung are very extensive ; the base of the lung and the con- vexity of the liver are exactly fitted to each other: this may be shown by making a vertical section from before backwards, upon the right side of the trunk, when the liver will be seen to be received, as it were, into a deep exca- vation in the base of the lung. This relation explains why abscesses and cysts of the liver may burst into the lung, and why abscesses of the lung point towards the liver ; why the liver may increase in size in the direction of the thorax, and push up the lung as far as the third or even the second rib ; and why eS"usions into the pleura may force the liver downwards in the abdo- men ; and also why peritonitis, confined to the region of the liver, is sometimes mistaken for pleurisy at the base of the thorax. The relations of the liver with the seven or eight inferior ribs, account for the impressions which are often seen upon its surface ; and also explain the facts, that violent blows upon the ribs may bruise this viscus; that pointed instruments thrust into the inter- costal spaces on the right side may wound it; and that abscesses of the liver point and open between the ribs. The relations of the convex surface of the liver with the abdominal parietes, which are so extensive in the new-born infant, and still more so in the foetus, are generally confined in the adult to a variable extent of the epigastrium, and to a small space below the edges of the ribs on the right side {fig. 155.). In certain conformations of the liver (almost always acquired), and in such diseases as are attended with an increased size of the organ, these relations become much more extended; and even in the absence of any disease, the liver is not unfrequently found to extend into the neighbourhood of the um- bilicus, or even into the right iliac region. In the erect posture the liver has a tendency to project below the ribs ; and therefore the sitting posture, with the upper part of the body inclining forwards, and resting upon some object, is the most favourable one for exploring this organ.* It is by no means rare * In an old woman, whose liver was deformed but healthy, and projected below the ribs, I was able to diagnosticate, by mediate percussion, the existence of a knuckle of intestine be- tween the liver and the parietes of the abdomen. Very lately 1 found a large loop of the transverse arch of the colon between the right lobe and the abdominal parietes, and a loop of the small intestine between the left lobe and those parietes.513 THE LI VEIL to meet with accidental adhesions between the liver and the diaphragm, con- sisting either of cellular filaments in the form of bands, or ot cellular tissue of a greater or less density. rr..- ■ The inferior or plane surface (pars sima, 11, fig. 154. &ndjig. 164.). 1 his is much more complicated th'an the upper surface, and upon it the hepatic vessels enter and make their exit from the liver. Certain eminences and depressions, or fissures of variable depth, are met with here, which have led to the division of the liver into several lobes; but that kind of division, which in animals appears to enable the organ to adapt itself to the form of the viscera of the abdomen, and has probably some relation with the conformation of the heart, cannot be said to exist in man. * This lower surface is directed downwards and backwards, and sometimes directly backwards : it presents for our consi- deration, in the first place, an antero-posterior fissure, or fissure of the umbilical vein, called also the longitudinal or horizontal&ssare {uh,fig. 164.), which extends from the anterior to the posterior border of the liver, and is divided by the trans- verse fissure (d p), meeting it at a right angle, into two halves, one anterior, the other posterior. The an- terior half lodges the mi umbilical vein in the M fcetus f, or the fibrous cord (u), to which it is reduced in the adult: the posterior half •V tdim^wsiv L, lodges the ductus ye- nosus in the foetus, or the fibrous band (u), by which it is replaced after birth. The anterior half of the longitudinal fissure is much deeper than the posterior, and is often converted into a complete canal by a sort of bridge formed by a prolongation of the substance of the liver: when incomplete, this bridge is always situated near the transverse fissure: it often consists of a band of fibrous tissue. Even when quite com- plete, it invariably presents a notch near the anterior border of the liver.J The posterior half of the longitudinal fissure inclines more or less obliquely to the left of the lobulus Spigelii (3), gives attachment like the transverse fissure to the gastro-hepatic omentum, and communicates with the fissure for the vena cava superior (c), behind the lobulus Spigelii. The existence of this fissure has been the chief cause of the division of the liver into the right or great lobe (1), and the left lobe (2), also termed the middle-sized lobe by those anatomists who admit as a third lobe the small lobe, the lobule, or the lobulus Spigelii (3). This division of the liver into two lobes is also marked on, the upper surface, as we have already seen, by the sus- pensory ligament. Of these lobes the right is much larger than the left; the former occupies the right hypochondrium ; the latter the epigastrium and left hypochondrium (^9. 161.). The proportion between the right and the left lobe cannot be precisely determined. The left lobe is sometimes reduced to a thin tongue, while at other times it is almost half the size of the right lobe. » The ancients admitted four lohes in the liver, which they distinguished by the singular names of mensn, porta^ eladivs, and U7tp;n7.K. + [The term uml)ilical fissure is olten restricted to this part of the longitudinal fissure • the posterior half is then called the fossa of the ductus venosus.] t [This bridge was purposely divided in the liver from whU-hJlir. \M. was drawn.] VOL. 1. L 1,514 SPLANCHNOLOGY. Generally, the relative proportion between them is as six to one. This, however, is but of little consequence ; for as the distinction between the two lobes is quite imaginary, the substance of the left may without any incon- venience be included in the right, and vice versa. The transverse fissure or fissure of the vena portae (d p) is the true hiius of the liver, for through it the hepatic vessels enter and pass out. It is a very broad transverse fissure, from fifteen to eighteen lines in length, occupying ahnost the middle of the lower surface of the liver, a little nearer to the posterior than to the anterior border, and to the left than to the right extremity. It is bounded on the left by the longitudinal fissure, with which it communicates; to the right of the gall bladder (g), it is prolonged obliquely forwards by a deep and narrow cleft. In the transverse fissure we find the vena portae, or the sinus (/>) of the vena portee, the hepatic artery (a), the roots of the hepatic duct (rf), a great number of lymphatic vessels and nerves, and a considerable quantity of cellular tissue. The gastro-hepatic omentum is given off from this fissure. The transverse fissure is situated between two eminences, called by the an- cients the piUars of the gate (portal eminences'). All the peculiarities of the inferior surface of the Uver may be referred to these two fissures. Thus, to the left of the longitudinal fissure we observe the inferior surface of the left lobe, slightly concave behind, where it is applied to the lobulus Spigelii, from which it is separated by the gastro-hepatic omentum; concave in front, so as to be adapted to the convexity of the stomach, upon which it is prolonged to a greater or less extent. This relation of the liver with the stomach is of the utmost importance. Thus, when the stomach is distended, it pushes the liver upwards and backwards in such a manner, that its lower surface is directed somewhat forwards. In cases of chronic ulceration of the stomach, the tissue of the liver is not unfrequently found supplying the place of the destroyed coats of the stomach, and this to a considerable extent. The lower surface of the left lobe is often in relation with the spleen, which it oc- casionally covers like a helmet. To the right of the longitudinal fissure, and in front of the transverse fissure, we find, upon the lower surface of the right lobe, the fossa for the gall bladder, which is more or less deep, oblong, and directed from before backwards, up- wards, and to the left side, like the gall bladder (g) itself, for the reception of which it is intended. This fossa is not always prolonged as far as the anterior border of the liver. Between the fossa of the gall bladder and the longi- tudinal fissure is a square surface, the lobulus quadratus, anterior portal eminence or anterior lobule (4). This surface sometimes terminates be- hind in a distinct rounded prominence, which justifies the name of eminence applied to it; at other times, on the contrary, this portion of the liver is flat- tened. . Behind the transverse fissure we find the posterior portal eminence, or smalt lobe {posterior lobule or lobule), also called the lobulus Spigelii (3), from the name of the anatomist to whom its discovery has been attributed, although it was described, and even figured before his time by Vesalius, Sylvius, and Eustachius. It varies much, both in size and shape, and is situated between the transverse fissure and the posterior border of the liver, and between the fissure of the ductus venosus («) on the left, and the fissure of the vena cava inferior (c) on the right. It is situated to the right of the oesophageal orifice of the stomach, opposite its lesser curvature, by which it is embraced; its form is that of a flattened semilunar tongue, convex upon its lower and free surface, which corresponds to the upper border of the pancreas, and has a projection in the centre, surrounded by an arterial circle, formed by the coronary artery of the stomach with the splenic and hepatic arteries. This proiection (above 3), is called by Haller, major colliculus in magna papilla: similihidinek; and by Wxn^\ov,,Veminence Irian^iulaire. From its PO/t^/'O': e-^ tremity a prolongation is given ofl' opposite the posterior border of the liver, which converts the fissure for the vena cava mferior into a canal that is some-515 THE LIVER. L L 2 times complete.* A prolongation, or ridge (5) (Jhe right prolongation of the lobule), passes from its anterior extremity to the right of tlie transverse fissure, and proceeding obliquely forwards, separates the renal (r) from the colic (o) depression. This prolongation was minutely described by the older anatomists, and has been termed by Haller the colliculus caudulus. f At its junction with the lobule, this prolongation is marked in front by a groove (the groove of the vena porta:), sufficiently deep to lodge the vena portae and the hepatic artery (a) ; and it is still more deeply excavated behind for the vena cava infe- rior (c) (the groove of the vena cava inferior). Sometimes the right margin of the first mentioned groove has a papilla, similar to that of the lobulus Spigelii; and in this case it might be said, that there are two lobes of Spigelius ; opposite this groove, the vena portse is separated from the vena cava only by a very thin lamina. The lobulus Spigelii presents much variety in its size; but not such as to enable it to be felt through the abdominal parietes, unless the enlargement is the consequence of disease. Physicians who pretend to recognise by the touch obstruction, or adhesion of the lobulus Spigelii f, are certainly not anatomists. To the right of the longitudinal fissure, the lower surface of the liver pre- sents, behind, an excavation of variable depth and extent in different subjects ; this is the renal impression (r) : it corresponds to the kidney, upon which it is exactly moulded, and with which it is loosely united, and also, though more loosely, with the suprarenal capsule. Sometimes the impression for the cap- sule is distinct from that for the kidney. It may be conceived that this im- pression must vary according as the liver corresponds to the upper third, to the upper half, or to the whole of the right kidney. This impression is always directed backwards. In front of the renal impression is a slight one, termed the colic depression (o), which corresponds with the angle formed by the ascending and transverse colon with part of the transverse colon itself, and sometimes also with the first portion of the duodenum. Behind is the groove for the vena cava inferior (c), which advances slightly upon the lower surface of the liver, on the inner side of the renal and capsular impression. The accidental fissures sometimes observed upon the lower surface of the liver, are traces of the divisions which exist in a great number of mammalia. To recapitulate the numerous objects seen upon the lower surface of the liver, we find as follows: — the antero-posterior or longitudinal fissure inter- sected at right angles by the transverse fissure; on the left of the antero-pos- terior fissure is the lower surface of the left lobe, presenting the depression for the lobulus Spigelii, the gastric impression, and sometimes the splenic ; on the right and m front of the transverse fissure, are the fossa of the gall bladder, and the anterior portal eminence, or lobulus quadratus; behind the transverse tssure is the postenor portal eminence or lobulus SpigeUi, with its right pro- longation or lobulus caudatus, and the groove for the vena portaj; and still more to the right are the renal and coUc impressions, and the groove for the inferior vena cava. The circumference of the liver. The anterior border of the liver presents a very thm, and as it were, sharp edge, which is directed obUquely upwards and to the left side corresponding to the base of the thorax on the right side, and projecting below it opposite the substernal notch {fig. 155.). Upon this edge there is invarmbly found a deep notch (below 2, fig. IGl.) for the umb.hcal vein; and more to the right another notch, which is often larger foL'lflt'tL'Lt^^'r tr^^;llTac''';:;;a'^t.^e''^r'o'or'rH''"^ '-eitudinal fissure groove heing partly ^ollowcd^ut of he lob 1, SnloX ll ^^^^ l^^"""' !

Some- times there is merely a trace of this notch, and sometimes it is altogether wanting. In some subjects there is only one great notch common to the gall bladder and the umbilical vein, and the borders of it are sinuous, or cut into small notches. It is almost always possible, when the parietes of the abdomen are relaxed, to insinuate the fingers between the ribs and the liver. The posterior border of the liver is very thick in all that part -which corre- sponds to the right side, and becomes gradually thinner as it approaches the left extremity. This border, which is short, rounded, and curved, so as to fit the convexity of the vertebral column, adheres intimately to the diaphragm by rather dense cellular tissue. The peritoneum is reflected, both above and below this border, from the diaphragm to the liver, to form what is called the coronary ligament. The cellular interval between these two layers of perito- neum is of irregular form, and varies in size. This border is divided Into two parts by a deep notch, which forms two thirds or three fourths of a canal for the reception of the inferior vena cava (c, fig. 164.). This notch is con- verted into a complete canal, sometimes by a sort of fibrous bridge, and some- times by a prolongation from the posterior extremity of the lobulus Spigelii. In order to comprehend the arrangement of the liver opposite this notch for the vena cava, that vein should be slit open, and we then see at the bottom of a deep notch a large cavity, into which all the hepatic veins (A h) open. We observe, also, that the antero-posterior fissure is continuous with the fissure of the vena cava, behind the lobulus Spigelii. This lobule, viewed from behind, appears like a tongue detached from the rest of the liver, by cu-cumscribing fissures and grooves. On the right side the liver terminates in a thick smooth extremity, forming the base of the pyramid to which this organ has been compared. A triangular fold of peritoneum, caUed the right triangular ligament (/), is stretched from the middle of this thick extremity to the diaphragm. On the left side the liver terminates in an angular or obtuse tongue, more or less elongated, and sometimes reaching as far as the spleen, to which I have seen it adherent. This prolongation, which is attached to the diaphragm by a triangular fold of peritoneum, called the left triangular ligament (3, fig. 161. ; /, fig. 164.) is slightly notched behind for the lower end of the ossophagus, which is bordered by it upon the left side. In one subject I saw this tongue com- pletely separated from the rest of the liver, with the exception of a vascular pedicle about four lines in length. This peculiarity was probably owing to traction exercised by the spleen, to which the prolongation from the liver was intimately adherent. . . Colour. The liver is of a reddish brown colour, the depth of which varies in different individuals. Its surface, and also sections of it, resemble in appear- ance a granite composed of two kinds of grains, the one deep brown, the other yellowish ; and hence has arisen the distinction between the two substances ol the liver In no tissue in the body is there greater variety in colom-, than in that of the liver. Independently of the different shades which it is impossible to describe, the liver is sometimes of a yeUowish, or canary-yellow, or a cha- mois-yellow (hence the name cirrhosis given to a particular disease ot the liver); or it may be of a more or less deep olive green hue ; or of a slate colour. These differences in colour, which have not perhaps been sufiiciently investigated, are connected with more or less decided alterations of texture. The chamois- yellow colour almost always indicates the existence of fatty degeneration. ^ Fragility. The fragility of the liver is one of the most important particula s in its description, it is con,pact ^nd fragile and cannot therefore be to^^^^^ compressed without suffering laceration ; hence the danger of contusions m the region of the liver, and the rules laid down by accoucheurs for avoiding all compression of the abdomen of the foetus during the manipulations re- quired i^nprTrracted labours.

In fatty degeneration of this organ, the liver retains the im- pression of the finger, and its fragility is in a great measure lost. Olive green and slate coloured livers are dense, their molecules are much more closely united, and they are lacerated with difficulty. Texture. Before the admirable works of Glisson and Malpighi, anatomists were in the habit of saying with Erasistratus, that the liver, like all other organs of a complicated structure, was a parenchyma, a vague term intended to imply the effusion of a particular juice around a series of vessels. Mal- pighi showed, in opposition to the assertion of Warthon, that the liver is a conglomerate gland; he examined the glandular granules (the lobules of Kier- nan), which Ruysch subsequently, by means of his beautiful injections, appeared to convert into vessels. Anatomists are still divided between the opinions of these two eminent observers, concerning the intimate structure of the liver, as well as of all other glands, some believing it to be granular, others that it is vascular. We have to consider the coverings and then the proper tissue of the liver. The coverings of the liver. These are two in number, viz. a peritoneal coat and a proper fibrous membrane. The peritoneal coat forms an almost complete covering for the liver ; the posterior border, the transverse fissure, the groove for the vena cava, and the fossa for the gall bladder, are the only parts that are destitute of this coat The peritoneum, from being reflected upon the liver from the diaphragm, con- stitutes the several folds called the falciform, coronai7, and triangular ligaments, of which we have ah-eady spoken. By means of this membrane, which is always moist, the liver is enabled to glide upon the adjacent parts without friction. We frequently find cellular adhesions between the liver and sur- rounding structures, which do not positively impair its functions. The peri- toneal coat adheres intimately to the proper membrane^ The proper or fibrous membrane is very well seen over such portions of the liver as are not covered by the peritoneum, and from these points it can be easily traced over the whole of the remainder of the organ. It constitutes the immediate investment of the liver; its outer surface is adherent to the peri- toneal coat, and its inner surface is connected with the tissue of the liver by means of fibrous prolongations interposed between the granules (lobules), affording to each a distinct covering. It passes into and lines the transverse fissure, and is prolonged around the corresponding divisions of the vena portse, the hepatic artery, and the biliary ducts, so as to form cylindrical sheaths for those groups of vessels, and for all their further divisions and subdivisions. These sheaths constitute the cap- sule of Glisson, which we must therefore regard as a dependence of the proper fibrous coat. The internal surface of these sheaths is united to the vessels only by a very loose cellular tissue. Their external surface adheres inti- mately to the tissue of the liver by fibrous prolongations, which interlace in everj' direction, and form distinct coverings for the deep-seated granules, analogous to those which we have already stated are produced from the proper coat. The liver therefore is traversed in all directions by very delicate fibro- cellular prolongations, forming a vast network in which the granules are contained. This proper coat moreover is fibrous f, not muscular as Glisson be- lieved. It may be said with truth to constitute the skeleton or framework of the liver ; for it affords a general covering for the organ, it is prolonged around the vena porta;, the hepatic artery and the biliary ducts, and it furnishes a fibrous or cellular covering for each of the granules composing the proper tissue of the liver. The fibrous cells thus formed become very distinct in certain cases of hepatic disease. In fact, this fibrous tissue not unfrequently becomes ' [It is composed of dense cellular or fibro-celliilar tissue ; for its use, see note, p. 521.] I> L 3SPLANCHNOLOGY. 516 so much hypertropliied, that some of the glandular granules are compressed and atrophied; and then larger or smaller portions of the liver appear to be converted into a reticulated fibrous tissue. The arrangement of the fibrous tissue IS also very manifest in cases of softening of the granules, which may then be easily scraped out of their cells, and the surface of the section thus treated presents the appearance of the cells in a honeycomb. The proper tissue of the liver. The first thing that strikes an observer in examining the structure of the liver, is the smoothness of its external surface, ■which does not present any of the lobulated appearance of most other glands! If we attentively examine this surface, either before or after the removal of its coverings, we find that it is most distinctly composed of granules (lobules, Kiernan) : the same is also rendered evident by making sections of the organ! or by tearing it: the granular arrangement has, it is true, been supposed to be the result of laceration. Froni the mottled appearance of the liver (like granite), already noticed, anatomists have admitted the existence of two substances, or rather two kinds of granules in this organ ; viz. reddish brown and yellow granules. This dis- tinction was first made by Ferrein {Hist. Acad, des Sciences, 1735) ; it is now generally recognised, and has even served as the basis of several more or less ingenious explanations. This anatomist called the brown substance me- dullary, and the yellow cortical, names evidently derived from a rude analogy between them and the medullary and cortical substances of the brain. Others have reversed the meaning of these two words ; but that is of little consequence. " These two substances," says Meckel, " are not arranged as in the brain, one external and the other internal; but alternately throughout the whole liver, the yellow substance forming the mass of the organ, and the brown sub- stance occupying the intervals." This distinction into two substances does not appear to me to be well founded. The error has arisen from assuming as constant, the existence of two colourSj which however are far from being distinguishable in all subjects. The two colours, yellow and brown, when they do exist, do not belong to two distinct granules; but rather to the same granule, which is yellow in the centre, where the bile is found; and reddish brown at the circumference, where the blood is collected.* The granules of the human liver are so small, that excepting when they become considerably enlarged, it is not well adapted for examination. The liver of the pig, in which the granules are naturally very large, appears to me the best suited for this purpose. I have been accustomed to divide the liver in difi"erent directions, to slit up and remove the veins which have been cut across, and afterwards to examine the granules in the semi-canals (g g, Jig. 165.; c c,Jig. 166.) which they then form. The granules (111) may thus be sepa- rated with the greatest facility ; they are small ovoid, elliptical, or rather polyhedral bodies, having five or six surfaces, and shaped so as to be moulded upon the surface of the adjacent granules, without leaving any interval. It is evident, therefore, that there is only one order of granules ; that these gra- nules are not arranged in lobules, as stated by Malpighif, but are merely in juxta-position; and that each has its proper capsule formed by prolongations of the fibrous coat. And as these granules can be isolated, and detached from the capsules in which they are merely lodged, without adhering to them, except at the points by which they receive and emit their vessels, it follows that they are independent of each other, and that the most complete alteration of one or more of them may take place, without the adjacent or intermediate ^ aee noce, page o^. ..... , . i i t a t [This statement illustrates the confusion that has prevailed from the terms lobule ana acinus having been employed by anatomical writers in different senses to those att^hed to them by Malpighi; the lobule of Malpighi is, in fact, equivalent to the granule of M.

Physicians who have paid much attention to pathological anatomy, have often mentioned their increased de- v«lopement, by the Same of hepar acinosum. This disease is characterised by the simultaneous occuiTence of atrophy of the entire organ which is reduced to one-half or one-third its original size, and of hypertrophy of the granules themselves. In what is caUed cirrhosis, the greater number of the granules are atrophied.* . . , , j ^ ^i, j The investigation of the structure of the liver is then reduced to the de- termination of the arrangement of the granules with respect to each other, of the mode in which the vessels are arranged, and of the structure of each granide^^ armnjfment of the granules, with regard to each other, is revealed by the following fact: — In the disease of the liver called ramolhsement (Diet, de Med. et Chir. Pratiq., art. Maladies du Foie), in which that organ is reduced to a sort of pulp, as soon as the investing membranes are torn, the tissue of the liver escapes like a brownish yellow pulp, which, as it is not fetid, cannot be supposed to be the result of gangrene. If this pulp be placed in water, myriads of small and very distinct yellow granules will be seen, resembling small raisin stones, and appended to the ramifications of the different kinds of vessels by vascular pedicles. This fact, which I have several times observed, is confirmed by the ob- servations of Harvey, who in his work upon the generation of animals says, that the tissue of the liver is formed along the umbilical vessels like a grape on its footstalk, a bud on the end of a twig, or an ear of corn springing from its stalk; and also by reference to comparative anatomy, for M.Blainville has informed me, that, in certain species of animals, the liver is formed by rows of glandular granules attached along the vessels, f 2. The vessels of the liver. The study of the vessels of the liver is one of the most important points in the history of that organ. Besides the arteries and veins corresponding to those of other parts of the body, the liver receives also a special system of veins, viz. the system of the vena porta, which is dis- tributed in its interior like an artery. It presents also, in the adult, the re- mains of a venous system peculiar to the foetus, the system of the umbilical vein; and lastly, it contains canals intended for the conveyance of the bile, named the biliary ducts. The special venous system of the liver, or the system of the vena portce, will be described more particularly in another place. I shall only now observe, that the branches of origin of this system commence in aU the abdominal organs concerned in the function of digestion ; that the ventral vena portse, resulting from the union of these branches, reaches the transverse fissure of the liver, and divides there into a right and left branch, which constitute the * The ingenious explanation which has been given of cirrhosis is then destitute of foundation. In cirrhosis, as I have shown in another place, there is neither atrophy of the red substance, nor hypertrophy of the yellow, but rather atrophy of the greater number of granules, with hyper- Irophy and yellow discolouration of the remainder. t Arrangement of the lobules. [According to M. Kiernan, from whose paper in the Phil. Trans, for 1833 this and tlie succeeding notes on the structure of the liver are derived, the lobules (granules, Cruveilhier) of the human liver are many-sided bodies, flattened on one surface, called the base, and forming processes in every other direction ; hence in a longi- tudinal section they present a foliated, and in a transverse section a polyhedral form. The bases of all the lobules (cc,fe 166.) rest on certain branches of the hepatic vein, called SKA-lobular veins (A A), whilst their other surfaces, surrounded by the capsular investments are either in contact with those of the adjacent lobules, or appear on the outer surface of the liver, or in the portal canals (gg.Jig. 165.), which contain the venaportiE, hepatic artery and hepatic duct, or in those for the larger trunks (/i, fig. 160.) of the hepatic vein. The intervals between the sides of the lobules are the interlobular j?iSM>Ts, and the points at which two or more of these meet are the Interlobular spaces. The superficial lobules are imperfect or more or less flattened on their exposed side.] '520 SPLANCHNOLOGY. hepatic vena portaj {p, 164.); and that these branches subdivide and spread into all parts of the liver, some forwards, and others backwards, but all following a transverse direction. The capsule of Glisson, as we have seen, is developed around this vein; so that in sections of the liver, the branches of the vena portae can always be recognised by these two characters — a trans- verse direction, and the presence of the capsule. Remains of the umbilical vein. We can easily conceive the arrangement of these remains, if we consider that in the foetus, the umbilical vein {u,fig. 164*.), proceeds from the placenta to the longitu- dinal fissure of the liver; and at the point where this is intersected by the trans- verse fissure, divides into two branches, one of which, under the name of the duc- tus venosus (rf), passes directly to the veua cava (c), at the point where it traverses the posterior border of the liver; while the other is continuous with the hepatic vena portse (p), which, as we have seen, occupies the transverse fissure. The por- tion common to the umbilical and portal veins remains pervious in the adult; but it then belongs exclusively to the vena portse. The ductus venosus then becomes a mere fibrous cord (u, fig. 164*.), as weU as the trunk of the umbilical vein itself (u). It is not rare to find the trunk of the umbilical vein persistent in the adult, from an abnormal communication between it and the veins of the abdominal parietes. (See Anat. Path., avec planches, liv. xvii. pi. 6.) No example has been recorded of a persistent ductus venosus. Arteries. The hepatic artery is a branch of the cceliac axis {t,Jig. 154.), which also furnishes branches to the spleen and the stomach; and although a difference in the origin of an artery does not occasion any difference in the blood within it, yet this community of origin is not the less remarkable, for it seems to denote a community, a coincidence, or a connection of function. Moreover, as the nervous plexuses are supported upon the arteries, it follows that the nerves of the spleen, stomach, and liver, are derived from a common plexus, the coeliac. We frequently find a seconi hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric. I must not omit to mention the smallness of the hepatic artery in comparison with the size and mass of the liver. In this respect few organs present so great a disproportion: compare for example the kidney and the renal artery, look at the muscles, and I may almost say at the bones. The small caliber of the hepatic artery enables us to determine a priori, that it cannot serve both for the nutrition of the organ and for the secretion of the bile. Lastly, it exactly follows the ramifications of the vena portae and the biliary ducts, and the capsule of Glisson is common to it and to those two sets of vessels. The hepatic veins. The hepatic veins, the efferent vessels of the liver, are not proportional to the size of the hepatic artery, but to that of the vena portae. Proceeding from all points of the liver, and converging towards the fissure of the vena cava, the hepatic veins {hh',fig. 164.), empty themselves into that vein (c), especially near the posterior border of the liver. It follows, thereifore, that the direction of the hepatic veins and of their divisions is from before backwards, while that of the divisions of the vena portae is transverse.* This direction, and the absence of the capsule of Glisson, on account of which the walls of these veins are directly adherent to the tissue of the liver, so that the veins themselves remain patent, while the sections of the vena portae collapse, are the two charaqters by which the divisions of the hepatic veins * At least in the prineipal trunks ; for tliero ai n ii great miitiher of r.imifications of the hepatic veins wliieh pass tr.insversely.521 THE LIVER. may be distinguished from those of the vena portal on simply inspecting a ^cLn of Se liver. Do these anatomical differences between the t^vo kinds of ve'ns Dioduce any difference in the mechanism of the cireulation through them? ITd is the lnt^f immediate connexion of the divisions of the vena port^ to the issue of the liver, intended to permit them to contract so as to propel he Sood ? If we consider that the blood of the vena port^ proceeds from the trunk towards the branches, as in the arteries, we may conceive the advantages which must result from an anatomical arrangement, that would allow these vessels to exert a direct pressure upon the blood. „ , , . . , Another point of difference between the branches of the hepatic vein and of the vena port* is, that the walls of the former are perforated by a multi- tude of extremely smaU openings or pores, which are the orifices of very small The hmphatic vessels. The lymphatics of the liver are so numerous that these vessels were first discovered in that organ ; indeed, it was for a long time re- garded as the origin of the lymphatic system, just as it had been originally considered the origin of the veins. The lymphatics of the hver form a superficial and a deep set. The superficial lymphatics are arranged in an ex- tremely close network under the peritoneal coat. The deep set, which are very large and numerous, pass out of the transverse fissure of the liver, and terminate partly in lymphatic glands situated along the hepatic vessels, and partly in the lumbar glands. They communicate directly and freely with the thoracic duct, so that one of the best methods of injecting this duct, consists in throwing the injection into the lymphatics of the liver. The nerves. These are very small, considering the size of the liver. They are derived from two sources," the cerebro-spinal and the ganglionic systems. The former are branches of the pneumogastric nerves; the latter constitute the hepatic plexus, which is an offset from the solar plexus. They are inter- laced around the hepatic artery: some of these nerves however, by a spe- cial exception, accompany the vena portae. It is generally admitted that a few filaments of the phrenic nerve are given to the liver. The biliary ducts. Whatever may be the origin of the biliary ducts, their radicles, however small they may be, are always found in the capsule of Glisson, together with the corresponding branches of the vena portse and he- patic artery. These radicles are united like veins into smaller, and these into larger branches, which at length constitute the hepatic duct (d,fig. 164.). They can be readily distinguished from the other vascular canals of the liver by their yellowish colour, by the fluid which they contain, and by the ap- pearance of their parietes.* » Vessels, [The first divisions of the vena portse, hepatic artery, and hepatic duct, are situ- ated in tlie portal canals, which are tubular passages formed in the tissue of the liver, com- mencing at the transverse fissure and branching through the substance of the organ. The smallest divisions of the portal canals contain one principal branch of each of these vessels (P o 16.5.): from these proceed smaller branches called vaginal, from their situation within the capsule of Glisson. lu the larger canals the vaginal veins {p') form a plexus in the substance of the capsule, and then give off the inter-lobular veins (pp) which pass between the lobules opposite the inter- lobular spaces, ramify in the inter-lobular fissures {pp,fig. 167.), and after freely anastomosing ujjon the capsular surfaces of the lobules, divide into branches which penetrate the lobules themselves. In the smaller portal canals the vaginal venous plexuses are less apparent, forniany of the inter-lobular veins (4) arise at once from the principal branch of the vena portae : where this occurs, the capsule of Glisson is very thin ; and, indeed, the chief use of this structure, in other situations, ap- pears to be to form a web, on which the vessels may ramify, so as to enter the liver at a great number of points, a use ana- logous to that of the pia mater and periosteum, in reference to the brain and bones. Tlie hepatic artery also forms vaginal plexuses in the portal give ofl' inter-lobular branches; from these vessels the proper capsule of Ihe I'anals, whichSPLANCHNOLOGY. of n" I!"^-!^ '•'■"'f'"'' "^^^'^ yanuhs? In examining a section of the liver ot a pig with the simple microscope, I have seen most distinctly that each trra- nule has a porous and spongy appearance, like the pith of the rush or elder so that the proper tissue of the liver resembles a sort of filter. This appearance was much more distinct in livers which I had injected with walnut oil either pure or coloured blue. The colouring matter thrown into the vena portaj was as It were, mfiltrated into the spongy tissue of the liver. ' If we endeavour to ascertain the structure of the liver by means of injections we shaU see what was observed by Soemmering, that whichever vessel be injected, whether the hepatic artery, the duct, the vena porta>, or the hepatic vein (provided only the injection be thin, as for example coloured glue size or spirits of turpentine, or better still a strong aqueous solution of gamboee)' there will not be a single granule into which the injection will not have pene- trated ; and moreover, that the Uquid thrown into one vessel wiU pass either into one, two, or aU three of the others ; and the facility with which this takes place, proves that the different orders of vessels communicate with each other directly, and not through the medium of cells or small cavities.* In a foetus, or an infant that has died immediately after birth, an injection through the umbilical vein gives similar results. I have never been able to force the liquid into the lymphatic vessels, at least without rupturing the tissue of the liver. Air driven into the vessels penetrates more easily than hquids into the lymphatics, no doubt on account of its greater subtlety. It follows, then, that in each granule there is an arterial radicle, a radicle of the vena portae, one of the hepatic vein, and one of the duct, probably some lymphatic vessels, and a nervous filament. The aggregate has been represented by Soemmering as having some resemblance to the arrangement of a Damask rose.f All the different vessels communicate freely with each other.J ■' Fig. m. liver, the capsule of Glisson, the capsules of the lobules, and the coats of the different vessels derive their nutrient arteries, which terminate in veins that enter the vena porta;. But few arterial branches enter the lobules themselves. The hepatic duct also has its vaginal branches, but it is doubtful whether they anastomose ; they are formed by the union of the inter-lobular branches (d rf, fig. 168.), which do appear to anastomose, and are derived from the biliary ducts, which pass out at the surface of the lo- bules. The several divisions of the hepatic veins are termed the hepatic venous trunks, the sub- lobular veins, and the m<ra-lobular veins. The inft fl-lobular veins U,flg. 1G6.; /i,fig. 1C7.), of which but 07ie, independent of the rest, emerges from the centre of the base of each lobule, open into the sub-lobular veins (A A), through the thin walls of which can be seen the polyedral bases of the lobules, and the central orifices (i' i') of the inter-lobular veins. This appear- ance is peculiar to the sub-lobular veins, the canals for which alone are formed by the bases (c c) of the lobules. The portal canals (g, fig. 165.) are formed by their capsular surfaces, "and the openings (A) seen in the interior of the small divisions of the vena portae, correspond to the inter-lobular spaces, not to the centres of the lobules. The sub-lobular veins anastomose with each other (this the divisions of the vena porta; never do), and unite to form the hepatic venous trunks (//, fig. 166.), into which no intra-lobular veins open, nor do the bases of any lobules rest upon them.] * [From this statement the ducts must be excepted ; they do not communicate with the blood- vessels. (See note, p.524.)] t " Quilibet acinus hepatis e glomeroso constat, vel e particulis arterias, vena; portariun, veiiie hepatic!E, ductus biliferi et vasorum absorbentium, cujus formam rosa; sic dicta' Daniasccua; imaginem pingere nobis licet." {Corp. Hum. Fab. t.vi. p. 180.) % See note, p. 524.523 THE LIVER. The manner in which these different vessels are arranged in each granule can only be discovered by injecting them simultaneously, or rather succes- sively, for it is nearly impossible to inject all the vessels of the hver at the same time. I have accordingly injected the vessels m the foOowmg order : — the vena cava, and consequently the hepatic vems, with wax coloured with Pmssian blue—a certain quantity of walnut oil, also containing Prussian blue, had been previously thrown into the same vein ; the vena portae with a red injection; the hepatic artery with the same ; and then the hepatic duct with a yeUow injection. These injections were made m the liver of a pig, the liver being placed in warm water, and the injections pushed in with a gradu- aUy increasing force. During the injection of the vena cava and vena portae, the wrinkles of the Hver disappeared, and the central depressions of the super- ficial granules became, on the contrary, slightly prominent. It was therefore evident that each granule was hoUow, and that the space had been failed by the injected matter. The liver thus injected and submitted to different chemical agents gave the following results: —The blue injection, or that which had been thrown into the vena cava, had penetrated into the central part of each granule, which is generally called the yellow substance of the liver. In the middle of the central part was the yellow injection from the hepatic duct. Around the blue in- jection was found that colom-ed red, which had been forced into the vena portfB and the hepatic artery, and which occupied all the so-called red sub- stance of the liver. It follows, therefore, that each granule had a vascular appa- ratus thus arranged: in the centre, a biliary duct; further removed from the centre, a vascular circle formed by the ramifications of the hepatic vein ; and ex- ternal to this another vascular circle, formed by ramifications of the vena portae and hepatic artery. As to the manner in which the vena portje and hepatic artery are arranged in relation to each other, we shall find, if we trace them into the substance of the liver, that the ramifications of the hepatic artery correspond exactly to those of the vena portae and biliary duct, which, as we have already said, are all contained in the same sheath ; and that they ramify and are lost upon the parietes of the vein and duct, almost in the same manner as the bronchial arteries are distributed upon the divisions of the air tubes. I must therefore conclude that the hepatic artery furnishes for the liver the nutritious vessels (vasa vasorum) of the vena portae and hepatic ducts ; and this will ex- plain the disproportion between its caliber and the size of the liver. The subdivisions of the hepatic veins, which follow a separate course, pre- sent a similar peculiarity to that observed in the splenic vein, viz. a multitude of pores or holes, by which very small veins open directly into them. Their ramifications are much less numerous than those of the vena portae. The result of the injections described above also explains the difference in colour between the centre and the circumference of each granule; it shows, moreover, that one part of the gi-anule is impermeable to injections; and its spongy nature, resembling that of the pith of the rush or elder, is apparent even to the naked eye, in a section of a liver thus injected, when viewed by a strong light. To resume, then, it may be said, that the liver is composed of ovoid, ellip- tical, or rather polyhedral granules, moulded closely upon each other. Each granule has its proper fibrous capsule ; and all the capsules are united together by prolongations, which also connect them with the general cellular invest- ment of the liver, and with that extension of it called the capsule of Glisson. The granules are independent of each other. Each of them consists of a spongy tissue, impermeable to injections ; of a bUiai7 duct proceeding from its centre ; of a venous network formed by the hepatic veins ; of another venous network belonging to the vena portae ; and of a very delicate arterial network derived from the hepatic artery, which is ramified upon the parietes of the vena portas and biliary ducts. Such is the structure of the liver.* It remains for me now to examine its excretory apparatus.524 SPLANCHNOLOGY. The Excretory Apparatus of the Liver. The excretory apparatus of the liver consists of the hepatic duct, of the cystic duct, of the gall bladder, and of the ductus communis choledochus. The hepato-cystic canals f, admitted by some authors as constant or occa- sional in man, can be easily shown in the lower animals, but do not exist in tlie human species. The. hepatic duct. Tlie hepatic duct arises in the granules of the liver by hepatic mrfic/esj, which, by uniting successively like veins, constitute small and then larger branches. These latter all converge towards the transverse fissure of the liver, where they terminate ultimately in two trunks of almost equal size, which join each other at a very obtuse angle, and foi-m the hepatic duct {d,fig. 164.). The condition of the branches of the hepatic duct in the transverse fissure is extremely variable: thus, sometimes the trunk of the right side is larger than that of the left, and sometimes the opposite is the case. Frequently several branches join the trunks late in the transverse fissure ; but whatever be the nature of these variations, the right trunk never corresponds exactly to the right lobe of the liver, nor the left to the left lobe. All the divisions and subdivisions of the hepatic duct § are contained in the * structure of the lobules. [It appears from the preceding note, that whilst several branches of the vena porta; and hepatic artery enter, and several of those of the hepatic duct pass out at the capsular surface of each lobule, only a single branch of the hepatic vein emerges from its base: within the lobules, the following is the arrangement of these vessels: The branches from the interlobular (portal) veins ('ppp^fig. lti7.)formin the outer portion of each lobule a venous plexus {I I), consisting of branches radiating towards the centre, connected by others passing transversely : these veins become capillary, ramify upon tlie biliary ducts, and terminating in the branches of the in- tra-lobular (hepatic) vein (A), which correspond in number with the processes on the surface of the lobule, ultimately unite to form the central vein that passes out at its base. The lobular arteries are few in number, and, according to Kiernan, end in branches of the vena portae, and not directly in those of the hepatic vein. Miiller inclines to the more commonly received opinion, that the three kinds of blood- vessels communicate with each other. No communication however exists, as stated by M. Cruveilhier, between the bloodvessels and the biliary ducts, which like the ducts of other glands, are an independent system of vessels. According to Mr. Kiernan the ducts form a reticulated plexus, occupying principally the outer portion of each lobule (as shown at b b, Jig. 168., which is a diagram copied from Mr. Kieman's paper). Miiller expresses doubts as Fig. 16S. ^ to the anastomosis of the ducts, and thinks it probable, from ^ analogical observation, that they terminate in tufts of tubes having blind extremities. The islets formed between the radiating and transverse branches of the lobular (portal) veins {l,Jig. 167.), correspond to the acini of Malpighi, and contain the biliary ducts with their capillary bloodvessels, and also a peculiar tissue, which occupies all the intervals between the several kinds of vessels, and consists, according to Krause, of hexagonal nucleated cells, having several bright points in them, like globules of oily matter. The appearance of two substances in the liver can now be explained ; it does not depend on the biliary ducts being si- tuated In the centre, and the veins nearer to the circumference of each lobule (see p. 518.523.), but in a partial congestion of either the portal or hepatic system of veins. In portal congestion the margins of the lobules are dark, and their centres pale; it is very rare, and has been seen only in children. . Of hepatic venous congestion there are two stages; m the first the centre of each lobule is dark and the margin pale (fig. 166.); it constitutes passive congestion, and is the common state'of the liver after death : in the second the congestion extends to the portal veins in the inter-lobular &s«rei, but not to those in the interlobular spaces, or points at which those fissures meet which spaces are then seen to occupy the centre of each pale isolated spot: this is active congestion of the liver; it occurs in diseases of the heart, and in acute diseases of the lungs and pleura,] , ,. ... ,,,_, jj t + [/. c. canals passiug directly from the liver into the-gall bladder.] i See note, suprd. § [Excepting those within the lobules.]THE LIVER. •''^25 o.ps„l. ot GUsson, .oge.her ,,.h <^::^X^^ ^"^^ "ht <l.,ft r«1 to form the ductus communis choledochus (c; and a, Jig. lo^-j- fbTs^itsf tWuc?is contained in the E^^^-o-l^vfo o^lf^^^^^^ the vena uortEe which is behind it, and the right branch ot the hepatic aiteiy Ihich is fn Son7of it.

The gall bladder {cystis fellea, g,fig. 164.) is the reservoir of the bile. It is situated at the lower surface of the right lobe of the liver, occupying a particular fossa (the fossa of the gall bladder) on the right of the longitudmal fissure from wHch it is separated by the lobulus quadratus. It is held m this place by the peritoneum, which, in "the majority of instances, merely passes below it, but, in others, almost entirely invests it, and thus attaches it to the hyer by a sort of mesentery. In this latter case it is at some distance from the liver, as in certain animals. • j- ^ a Its form is that of a pear, or of a cone with a rounded base; it is directed obUquely, so that its great extremity {g, figs. 155. 161.) looks forwards, downwards, and to the right; and its smaU extremity, backwards, upwards, and to the left side. , . , , ^-u ^ Size. The small size of the gall bladder corresponds with that ot the rest of the excretory apparatus of the bile, and is strongly contrasted with the great bulk of the liver. This difference becomes still more striking if we compare, on the one hand, the kidney with the liver, and, on the other, the urinary bladder with the gall bladder. It is true, however, that aU the urine must pass through the former, while a part only of the bile is deposited in the The size of the gall bladder, however, is subject to considerable variety; it sometimes acquires three, four, or even ten times its usual size from retention of the bile, in consequence of obstruction in the ductus choledochus.* Cases have been recorded in which it contained six, eight, or ten pounds of bile, but this I can scarcely credit. On the other hand, it is sometimes closely con- tracted round a small calculus, whilst the cystic duct is completely obliter- ated, and reduced to a fibrous cord. It must undoubtedly have been such cases as these, that have been regarded as examples of congenital absence of the gall bladder. Relations. In order to facilitate our description, we shall consider the gall bladder as consisting of a body, z. fundus, and a neck. The fiorfy is conical, and has the following relations:—below, where it is covered by the peritoneum, it is in relation with the first portion of the duode- num, and the right extremity of the arch of the colon. It is not unfrequently found in contact with the pylorus, or even with the pyloric end of the stomach. Sometimes it is united by accidental or normal adhesions to the duodenum and arch of the colon. These relations account for the yellow or green discolour- ation which always takes place after death in those parts of the alimentary * Another cause of enlargement of the gull binder is the obstruction of its neck by a cal- culus; but instead of bile, it then contains a limpid serum, and in fact is converted into a serous cyst. The tumour thus formed may be compared to the lachrymal tumour in cases of obstruction of the lachrymal puncta or canals.SPLANCHNOLOGY. canal that are in contact with the gall bladder; and also for the passaire of biliary calculi into the duodenum, the colon, and the stomach. It is not vo^v thk r^f ""^'P'''" ^-h^l" to the right k"dne7 this relation can only occur after descent of the duodemmi and transverse colon. Above, the body of the gall bladder adheres to the cystic fossa by ^ more or less loose ceUular tissue * and by arteries and veins, Lrnever in the human subject by biliary, i. e. hepato-cystic, ducts. The fundwi of the gaU bladder (y, fig. 161.), entirely covered by the neri- toneum, generaUy projects beyond the anterior margin of the liver and comes into relation with the abdominal parietes, opposite the outer border of the r^ht ^TtvnfTrf' ';?°'-k'^ wl^'^^^ '^'/f'^.^ ""^''^^Ses near the anterior extre- ,K? 1""°^ ^-^° distended with bUe or calculi, the fundus of the gall bladder becomes promment, so as to raise the abdominal parietes, through which It has been felt in emaciated individuals. It has even been statfd that the noise made by the calculi may be heard on percussion. This relation explains the possibility of the occurrence of abdominal biliary fistula; and whv calculi may escape through such openings: on it also is founded the scheme tor extracting the calculi by an operation analogous to that performed for stone in the urinary bladder, and which I should not have mentioned had it not been proposed by J. L. Petit. The relations as well as the size of the fundus of the gaU bladder present many varieties. The fundus, or that part which projects beyond the liver is sometimes as large as the body. I have seen this part of the gaU bladder turned back at a right angle upon its body, and reaching the umbiUcus. It may be conceived that the ditferences in the form and situation of the liver must greatly influence the situation of the fundus of the gall bladder, which I have found in the hypogastrium and in the right Uiac fossa, either with or without adhesion to the neighboui-ing parts. The neck or apex of the gall bladder is twice bent suddenly upon itself, like an Italic S, having its three portions in contact. It would appear, in some cases, that these two curves resemble the thread of a screw. This double curvature may be easily effaced by removing the peritoneum with the subja- cent cellular tissue. The limits between the neck and the body of the gall bladder on the one hand, and between the neck and the cystic duct on the other, are marked externally by a constriction. The internal surface of the gall bladder is tinged either green or yellow, ac- cording to the colour of the bile ; but this staining is the effect of transudation after death : its natural colour is a whitish grey. Moreover, the internal sur- face is irregular, like shagreen, and has some crests or prominences arranged upon it in polygons, and again subdivided by smaller crests, like the reticu- lum in the stomach of ruminantia ; so that when examined by a strong lens, it appears divided into a number of small and very distinct alveoli : some highly developed papillae or villi, of a very irregular shape, are also found upon it. As to the object of either the crests or the papillae, or whether they favour ab- sorption by multiplying the surface, we are altogether unable to decide. Opposite each of the two curves of the S, described by the neck of the gall bladder, we find a very large valve. The two valves, which are in opposite directions, as well as the curves, result from the alternate inflection of the neck itself, and are effaced by straightening that part. The portion of the neck between the two valves is not unfrequently dilated into an ampulla. A calculus is often formed in this intermediate portion, where it remains as it were en- cysted, and intercepts the course of the bile ; and that the more easily, because the valves greatly contract the openings from the neck into the body of the * This cellular tissue may become inflamed, and if pus be formed, it may pass into tlie gall bladder, whilst the bile escapes into the cellular tissue, and hence death may ensue.

Moreover, these valves are opposed neither to the entrance of the bile into, nor to its exit from, the bladder. Structure. Proceeding from -without inwards, we find that the gall bladder is composed of, 1. a peritoneal coat, which is reflected from the lower surface of the liver upon the bladder, completely invests its fundus, forms a more or less incomplete covering for its body and neck, and is continuous with the anterior layer of the gastro-hepatic omentum. 2. An areolar fibrous coat, which forms as it were the framework of the bladder, and prevents its sudden distension, though it will yield to a long-continued distending force ; but I have not been able to see the muscular fibres admitted by some authors, and which can be so easily demonstrated in the larger animals, the ox in particular. 3. An internal mucous membrane, the principal characters of which I have noticed when speaking of the internal surface of the gall bladder: it presents some folds, which may be easily distinguished from the borders of the alveoli, because they are readily effaced by distension. After the most attentive examination, I have been unable to recognise any crypts or follicles. The gall bladder receives one very considerable artery, the cystic branch of 1 the hepatic. The cystic vein terminates in the vena portee. The lymphatic vessels are very numerous and easily demonstrated; they are sometimes tinged by the colouring matter of the bile. Its nerves are derived from the hepatic plexus. The cystic duct. The cystic duct {s,fig. 169.), or excretory duct for the bile, is the smallest of all the biliary canals : it is not uncommon, however, to find it of an equal or even larger size than the others; in which case there has always been some obstacle to the flow of the bile through the ductus communis choledochus (c). It commences at the neck of the gall bladder, passes down- wards and to the left side for about an inch, and unites at a very acute angle with the hepatic duct (€). It is not straight, but inflected, and, as it were, sinuous. Relations. It is situated in the substance of the gastro-hepatic omentum, in front of the vena cava, the cystic artery being on its left side. Its internal surface is remarkable for its valves, which are indefinite in number ; according to Soemmering there are from nine to twenty, but this appears to me to be au exaggeration ; I have counted from five to twelve. These valves are concave at their free margins, irregular, alternate, oblique, transverse, sometimes even vertical, and united together by small oblique valves. In order to understand their structure, a cystic duct must be examined imder water, or rather an in- flated and dried specimen. This alternate arrangement of the valves, some- times gives a spiral appearance to the inner surface of the cystic duct. * These valves, which only exist in man, perhaps on account of the erect position pecu- liar to him, are not efi'aced, like the valves in the neck of the gall bladder, by such dissection as will allow of straightening of the duct. Small calculi are occasionally met with in the intervals between the valves, giving to the cystic duct a nodulated appearance, and intercepting the flow of the bile. More- over, the valves of the cystic duct are not more opposed to the descent than to the ascent of the bile. It is even probable that they facilitate the ascent of the bile into the gall bladder by supporting the column of liquid, like the valves of the veins. Perhaps they are also intended to retard the course of the bile from the gall bladder towards the ductus choledochus. From their appearing sometimes to have a spiral arrangement, M. Amussat has advanced a very ingenious opinion — that the ascent of the bile is effected by a contrivance like an Archimedes' screw. But an Archimedes' screw only causes the ascent of a liquid when a rotatory movement is communicated to it, and how can such a movement be performed by the cystic duct? f ^'''q'""" spiralis fiibrica: imaginem ferrc."

Another, and perhaps more simple, man- ner of viewing the excretory canals of the liver would be to consider the hepatic duct as giving off to the right, after a certain course, the cystic duct, which, after passing backwards, dilates into an oval ampulla to form the gall blad- der ; and the ductus chole- dochus as nothing more than the continuation of the he- patic duct. The direction of the ductus choledochus is in fact the same as that of the hepatic duct, i. e. obliquely downwards, a little to the right, and backwards : there is no line of demarcation between these two ducts: in the natural state there is no marked difference in their diameters : the ductus choledochus, when collapsed, is about as large as a moderately sized goosequill. The same causes give rise to dilatation of the ductus choledochus and of the hepatic duct. I have seen the former as large as the duodenum. {Anat. Pathol, avec planches.) Its length is from two to two inches and a half. Relations. In the first part of its course, before it reaches the duodenimi, the ductus choledochus is included in the gastro-hepatic omentum, in front of the vena portse, and below the hepatic artery, having the right gastro-epiploic artei'y along its left side, and surrounded by loose cellular tissue, a great number of lymphatic vessels, and several lymphatic glands. Having reached the duodenum, opposite the first flexure of that intestine, it passes behind and to the inner side of its second portion, and is there received into a groove, or more commonly into a complete canal, formed for it by the pancreas. Lastly, it penetrates very obliquely into the substance of the duodenum, about the middle of its second or vertical portion, perforates the muscular coat, passes between that and the fibrous coat, then between the fibrous coat and the mucous membrane, elevating the latter when distended with bile or by a probe, and after a course of about seven or eight lines between the coats, opens into the duodenum, about the lower part of the second portion, at the summit of a nipple-like eminence (above e'), which is more or less prominent in different subjects. In this third portion of its course the ductus choledochus is in relation with the pancreatic duct (m), which is situated on its left. Opposite the base of the eminence above mentioned, the two ducts unite, or rather the pancreatic duct opens into the ductus choledochus ; so that, at its termination, the latter may be regarded as a canal having a triple origin, viz. an hepatic, a cystic, and a pancreatic* into the gall bladder, has advanced very singular views concerning the formation and uses of the bile. The bile, according to him, is formed in the gall bladder, and carried by the cystic duct into the hepatic duct and the ductus choledochus. By his theory, the bile which readies the liver through the hepatic duct, assists greatly in sanguification. .This opinion, altogether erroneous as it is, has perhaps exercised a great influence in science, by contributing to cr.i- dicate the idea of the bile being an acrid, corrosive, and essentially injurious, excrementitial lluid. * Hence the definition of Soemmering: "Ductus choledochus,idesl.ductus hepalicus.ct/sUciis. el pnncrt'aticus, in mium conflali" {Cnrpor. Hum. Fabric, torn. vi. p. 18G.)529 THE LIVER. Internal surface of the ductus hepaticus and ductus choledochus. The internal surface of both the hepatic duct and the ductus choledochus is characterised by the absence of valves, though traces of valves are occasionally met with in the ductus choledochus ; by the absence of the alveolar structure observed in the gall bladder ; and by having a multitude of openings or well marked pores, which are considered as belonging to muciparous follicles, and are apparently formed by an interlacement of fasciculi, having a fibrous character, and in- tersecting each other at very acute angles. The ductus choledochus and the hepatic duct are of uniform caliber throughout their whole length. The ductus choledochus is contracted a little in its third or duodenal portion ; it dilates into an olive-shaped ampulla, opposite the base of the papilla in the duodenum, and opens by an extremely small orifice or mouth: hence the reason why biliary calculi are so frequently arrested in the ampulla of the ductus choledochus. From the narrowness of the duodenal orifice of the ductus choledochus, from the moveable or yielding nature of the eminence upon which it opens, and from the oblique course of the duct through the substance of the walls of the duodenum, it follows that the bile and the pancreatic fluid may pass freely from the ductus choledochus into the duodenum, but cannot regurgitate from the duodenum into the duct. On this subject I have made several experi- ments. I have forcibly injected both water and air into the duodenum, in- cluded between two ligatui'es, but nothing entered into the biliary canals: on the other hand, I have injected the same fluids from the gall bladder into the duodenum, which I was thus able to distend at pleasure. But then, on compressing the bowel thus distended with great force, I have never been able to cause the slightest reflux into the biliary canals.* At the union of the cystic and hepatic ducts there is a very long spur- shaped process, formed by the lining membrane reflected upon itself. At the junction of the ductus choledochus and the pancreatic duct there is also a similar process, which I have seen extending down to the duodenal orifice. In neither situation do these processes prevent the fluid of one canal from passing into the other. Thus, the cystic bile might flow back into the hepatic duct, the pancreatic fluid might regurgitate into the ductus choledochus, and on the other hand the bile might enter the pancreatic duct, if these canals were not habitually full. Moreover, the spur-shaped process, between the ductus choledochus and the pancreatic canal, cannot arrest the flow, either of the bile or the pancreatic fluid, by being applied to the orifice of the one or other duct. Structure of the biliary ducts. All the biliary ducts have a similar structure : - they have an internal mucous membrane, continuous on the one hand with the lining membrane of the gall bladder, and on the other with that of the duo- denum ; it is thin, and provided with slightly developed papillse f; a proper membrane, composed of a dense areolar tissue, generally regarded as fibrous, but which appears to me analogous to the tissue of the dartos condensed ; a cellular layer connecting these canals to the surrounding parts; and lastly the peritoneum, which forms a very incomplete accessory tunic for them. Thus constituted, the biliary ducts have very thin walls, so that they col- lapse like veins, and are extremely dilatable. In certain cases of retention of the bile we find the ductus choledochus and the hepatic duct as large as the duodenum, the divisions of the hepatic duct dilated in proportion, and the i„^^l°TiT»?'l-r°* another no less incontestable, viz. the pass.igc of lunibnci into the biliary ducts ? The reason is, that the lumbricus is a foreign body, which has a power of selection and is able to overcome an obstacle, to seek for the oriBce of the due us choledochus, and to introduce itself within it. uuccus + [Numerous follicles are found in the ductus communis and in the hepatic duct, and all its subdivisions; according to Mr. Kiernan, even in the smallest that can be examined In the ilofg^ppri?c?s&fThnucfo' '"'"^ "'""•■"'"'^ longitudi„al'?ow^ VOL. I.SPLANCHNOLOGY. 530 tissue of the liver more or less atrophied by tlie compression to which it has been subjected. Developement of the liver. The developement of the liver is one of the most important subjects in its history. Under this head we have several points to consider: — 1. The time of its appearance is anterior to that of any other organ *: in the first days of intra-uterine life it may be distinguished by its colour in the midst of the cellular mass ■which represents the foetus. 2. In size the liver is relatively larger as it is examined at an earlier period of developement. Thus, according to Walter, in the embryo of three weeks it forms one half the weight of the whole body. This enormous proportion is maintained during the first half of intra-uterine life. After this period its growth is slower, while that of the other organs is proportionally increased, so that at birth the weight of the liver is one eighteenth that of the whole body, f After birth the liver undergoes an absolute diminution; some authors have even affirmed that a comparison of the weight of the liver in new-born infants and in children of nine or ten months old, gives a difference of one fourth in favour of the former. It is generally said that the difference in size affects the left rather than the right lobe ; but this has not appeared evi- dent to me. Towards the age of puberty the liver has the same relative bulk as at later periods. Attempts have been made to ascertain the propor- tion between the weight of this organ and that of the body, and it has been said that it forms one-thirty sixth part of the whole body. But what relation can be established between two terms, one of which, viz. the weight of the body, is subject to continual variations ? In old age the liver is smaller than in the adult, a diminution apparently in unison with that which occurs in all the other organs. 3. The differences in the situation of the liver are connected with its vari- ations in size : thus, in the first half of iutra-uterine life, the liver occupies the greatest part of the abdomen, and is in relation with certain regions in which it is not found at more advanced stages. In the earliest periods it descends as low as the crest of the ilium, and when the abdomen is opened it presents the appearance of a red mass, beneath which are placed the other abdominal viscera. During the second half of intra-uterine life and at birth it occupies only a part of the abdomen ; but it still corresponds to a considerable extent of the abdominal parietes: hence the ease with which it is ruptured by pressure upon the abdomen of a new-born infant. One fact, on record, seemed to me to prove, that in a first labour, where the feet presented, the pressure of the genital organs of the mother was sufficient to produce this result. (Vide Proces-verbal de la Distribution des Prix de la Maternite, 1832.) In the earliest periods the falciform ligament of the liver corresponds to the median line of the body; at birth it is a little to the right of that line, and is afterwards removed still further in the same direction. 4. The great size of the liver during intra-utt-rine life is connected with the existence of the umbilical vein, by which the foetus receives the blood returned from the placenta, that is to say, all the blood necessary for its nutrition. The rapid diminution of the liver after birth is probably owing to the obliteration of this vein. It is a very remarkable fact, that the persistence of this vein m the adult is not accompanied by an unusually large liver. In one particular case of persistence of the umbilical vein the liver was of a very small size. (^Anat.

The tissue of the liver of the fcetus is of a pale red colour in the early periods, and of a deep brown near the full term of pregnancy; its colour be- comes lighter after birth. The liver contains a greater quantity of blood before than after birth. Its tissue is the less consistent, the earlier the stage of developement at which we examine it, and its softness is accompanied with great fragility. 6. The distinction between what are called the two substances of the liver is not appreciable during intra-uterine life. It only becomes apparent after birth. Functions. The liver is the secreting organ of the bile. The bile is secreted in the glandular granules by an unknown process. Doubts are still entertained as to whether the materials from which the secretion is formed are conveyed by the hepatic artery or the vena portse.* The opinion advanced by some modern authors, that the yeUow substance of the liver is the only part con- cerned in the secretion of the bile, and that the brown substance has other uses, is a purely gratuitous hypothesis. The bile traverses the several ramifications of the hepatic duct, and having arrived in the principal duct, it may either enter directly into the 'duodenum by the ductus choledochus, or it may pass into the gaU bladder by the cystic duct. This retrograde movement towards the gall bladder has much occupied the attention of physiologists: perhaps it may be explained by the narrowness of the duodenal orifice of the ductus choledochus, by the elas- ticity of that canal, and especially by the pressure exercised on its duodenal portion by the circular fibres of the duodenum. The gall bladder and the cys- tic duct are not indispensable to the elimination of the bile. Nothing is more common than to find the excretory apparatus of the liver in old subjects reduced to the hepatic duct and the ductus choledochus. Has the liver any other function besides that of secreting bile ? The dis- proportion existing between the size of that organ and of its excretory appa- ratus, and also the enormous bulk of the liver during foetal life, i. e. at a time when the secretion of bile is at its minimum of activity, are both in favour of the opinion that the liver has some additional function ; and if agam we consider that in the adult a very important system of veins is dis- tributed to the liver, and that in the foetus it receives the blood from the veins of the foetal portion of the placenta, we shall be led to presume that the un- known functions of this organ are in some way connected with the process of sanguification. The Pancreas. Dissection. The pancreas may be seen, through the gastro-hepatic omentum, after drawing down the stomach, without any dissection. In order to expose it turn the stomach upwards (see^?^. 154.), after having divided the two layers of peritoneum which proceed from its greater curvature to form the great omentum It may also be exposed by turning the arch of the colon upwtrds, and dividing the inferior layer of the transverse mesocolon. The excretorv duct IS situated m the mterior of the organ. In order to dissect it, the glandular substance which covers it must be very carefully removed, towards the middle and the right extremity of the gland. It may be injecied from the ductus choledochus, after the vertical portion of the duodenum has been in- cluded between two ligatures: when the duodenum is filled with the injection he pancreatic duct becomes filled in its turn. It may also be injected from t lT^' choledochus after having passed a ligature round the projectron or ampulla which is common to the two ducts "jci-uon The partcreas (,rav-«pe'as, all flesh) is a glandular organ annexed to the artery is only indirccll;/ concerned, i. e. after it has XrdPri nntriHnn ti^ i °^ '"'P»"<-" of the liver, and has entered the branche's'l^ Jl'^vl.^fjonlrand thus be^'o^'^taT'ul Ji^rf^SPLANCHNOLOGY. 532 duodenum, with which it has immediate relations : it is situated transversely and deeply behind the stomach, and in front of the lumbar vertebra;. Form and size. In form the pancreas resembles no other gland; it is transversely oblong, flattened from before backwards, large at its right ex- tremity, where it presents a sort of angular expansion like a hammer, and gra- dually tapering towards its left extremity : hence the division of this organ mto^ a head, body, and tail. Its long or transverse diameter is measured by the interval between the concavity of the duodenum (e e) and the spleen {li). The size and weight of the pancreas present many varieties. Its weight is generally from two to two and a half ounces, but may reach six ounces. The pancreas is sometimes found atrophied, and in one case of this kind it did not exceed an ounce in weight. Relations. Its anterior surface, convex and covered by the peritoneum, is in relation with the stomach, which moves freely upon it. In certain cases of dis- ease, adhesion between the pancreas and the stomach takes place; so that in chronic ulceration of the latter we find the pancreas supplying the place of large portions of the walls of the stomach which had been destroyed. When the stomach is situated lower down than usual, the pancreas has relations •either with the liver, or with the anterior walls of the abdomen, from which it is separated only by the gastro-hepatic omentum ; so that it may be felt with the greatest ease through the abdominal parietes.* In such cases even experienced practitioners have not unfrequently been led to infer the presence of scirrhus of the pylorus. The pancreas is also in relation in front with the first portion of the duodenum, and with the angle formed by the ascending and transverse colon. Its posterior surface is concave, and corresponds to the vertebral colimin, opposite the first lumbar vertebra: it is separated from the spine, however, by the splenic and the superior mesenteric veins, and by the commencement of the vena porta;. The two last mentioned veins are lodged in a deep groove, or rather almost complete canal, formed in the pancreas, which also includes the superior mesenteric artery and its surrounding plexus of nerves. A gi-eat number of lymphatic vessels and glands, the pillars of the diaphragm ((/ d), the vena cava on the right side, and the aorta on the left, also separate the pancreas from the vertebral column. To the left of the spine it is in relation with the left suprarenal capsule and kidney, and the corresponding renal vessels. The relation of the pancreas to the aorta is important; it is through the pancreas that the pulsations of that vessel are felt in the epigastrium, in emaciated individuals, and it is here that the vessel may be compressed. Its upper border is thick, and is grooved for the reception of the splenic artery, which often runs in a sort of hollow canal formed in the substance of the gland through its entire length. It also has relations with the first por- tion of the duodenum (e), with the lobulus Spigelii, and with the coeliac axis (0- The thickness of this border has led some anatomists to say, that the pancreas is prismatic and triangular. Its hwer border is much thinner than the upper, and is bounded by the third portion of the duodenum, from which it is separated on the left by the superior mesenteric vessels (m, the artery). Its right, or duodenal, or great extremity is in contact with the duodenum and the ductus choledochus. This extremity presents a very remarkable arrange- ment ; it is curved upon itself from above downwards, like the duodenum, by the concavity of which it is circumscribed; then, having reached the third portion of the bowel, it passes transversely to the left, behind the superior me- senteric vessels, and forms the posterior waU of the canal in which they are « This condition mav be foretold: it occurs whenever the vertebral column can be felt im- medi^telv behind theT^netes of the abdomen.

It is seen then, that, in its relations to other parts, the pancreas has a great analogy with the saUvary glands. Thus, large vessels are situated near and penetrate this gland, which forms a sort of covered passage for them, and is moved by their piUsations. The diaphragm, the duodenum, and the stomach also tend to disturb and press upon the pancreas. Structure. The analogies in structure between the pancreas and the salivary glands are no less numerous, and fully justify the name of abdominal salivary gland given to it by Siebold ; it has the same whitish colour, the same density*, and the same arrangement into lobes, which are themselves divisible into lobules. The identity is such that it would be impossible to distinguish a portion of the pancreas from a part of a salivary gland. When boiled, they both have the same aspect and the same taste. There is no fibrous capsule, properly so called, but some fibrous lamellae, which separate the lobes and lobules. Cellular tissue is tolerably abundant. Fat is not uncommonly met with, either on the surface or in the substance of the pancreas; I have even seen cases of atrophy of the gland, in which fat appeared to have been substituted for the glandular substance. The determination of the structure of the pancreas, like that of all glands, iuvolves two considerations, viz. the texture of each lobule, and the arrange- ment of the vessels and nerves in the substance of the gland. With regard to the first point, I shall merely refer to what has been already stated respecting the salivary glands.f The arrangement of the vessels is perfectly well known. As in the salivary glands, the arteries enter the pancreas at a great number of points. They are very numerous and very large, considering the small size of the organ : they arise from the hepatic, the splenic, and the superior mesenteric. The principal artery is called the pancreatico-duodenalis. The veins terminate in the superior mesenteric and the splenic. The lymphatic vessels are not well known; it is probable that they enter the nu- merous glands which are in the neighboui'hood. The nerves of the pancreas are derived from the solar plexus. The excretory duct («, fig. 169.) is called the canal of Wirsung, from the name of its discoverer, a young anatomist, who was too soon lost to science. By an arrangement, of which we have no other example in the body, this ex- cretory duct is contained entirely in the substance, we might even say in the centre of the gland; so that, in order to expose it, the superficial portion of the organ must be carefully divided. It is generally single, but sometimes double, and then there is a principal duct belonging to the body of the pancreas, and a small duct for the reflected portion, or lesser pancreas. The pancreatic duct measures the entire length of the gland; it is narrow at the splenic ex- tremity, which may be regarded as its origin, and gradually increases in size as it approaches the duodenal extremity ; there it bends downwards, to reach the ductus choledochus, to the left of which it is placed ; it runs along the side * The pancreas sometimes assumes an extreme density, strongly resembling tliat of scirrhus. In sucli a case it is necessary to malic sections of it, to be assured of the perfect soundness of the glanduLir tissue. This stony hardness generally occurs along with .atrophy of the org.m. -f- [The only observable difference between tlie lobules of the pancreas and salivary glands is, tliat the closed termination of the ducts are cylindrical in the former, and slightly dilated in the latter, (see note, p.

The ultimate ducts of the pancreas do not m fact unite into larger and larger branches like the veins ; but the smaU branches commg from each lobule, open directly and in succession into tne general duct —an arrangement which gives to the excretory apparatus of tue pancreas the appearance of those insects called centipedes. As to the structure of the pancreatic duct, its walls are very thin; it is col- lapsed, and of a milk-white colour, very distinct from the greyish white hue ot the proper tissue of the gland. Its internal surface is extremely smooth, like a serous membrane * ; its thinness renders the determination of its texture very ditticult; it is very extensible. Developemeiit. The developement of the pancreas presents no peculiarities excepting such as relate to its size, which is relatively greater in the foetus and the new-bom infant than in the adult. Examples have occurred of disease of the pancreas during intra-uterine life ; and I have found a scirrhous pan- creas in a foetus at the full term. Function. The pancreas is the secreting organ of a particular fluid called the pancreatic fluid, the physical and chemical characters of which have not been well known until very lately. I have met with two cases of retention of the pancreatic fluid. The dilated canal resembled a transparent serous cyst; the contained liquid was extremely viscid and transparent, but of a whitish hue, like a solution of gum arable ; it had a slightly saline taste ; the collateral ducts were extremely dilated. There were some white patches, resembling plaster, in the centre of many of the lobules. This substance was more abun- dant in some of the lobules, and, when removed, presented the appearance of small lumps of plaster or chalk. The pancreatic fluid submitted to chemical analysis by M. Barrael, proved to be an extremely pure mucus. M. Barruel even stated to me that it was the purest mucus he had ever examined. It pos- sesses in the highest degree the property of rendering water viscid, either by dissolving, or by being diffused in it. This mucus contains free soda, a trace of chloride of sodium, and a very slight trace of phosphate of lime. There is therefore an analogy between the pancreatic and salivary fluids, as the ana- tomical investigation of these glands had previously led us to suppose.f * [It is a mucous membrane, continuous with that of the duodenum, and covered with epi- thelium. In some subjects, Mr. Kiernan found mucous follicles in it, similar to those in the biliary ducts ; in others, no traces of them could be discovered. None were seen in the salivary ducts.] t [According to the best analyses, the pancreatic fluid differs from saliva in containing a greater amount of solid matter, and also in the character of its constituents: saliva is usually alkaline, and, besides other substances, contains salivine, mucus, and sulpho-cyanate of pntassa ; the pancreatic fluid contains albumen, casein, but little salivine and mucus, and no sulpho- cyanate : in other respects the two fluids agree.]THE SPLEEN. 535 M M 4 The Spi-een. The spleen (cr,rXV, lien; k, fig. 154.) is a spongy and vascular organ, the functions of which, though little known, appear to be connected with those of the abdominal venous system. x . , i, v j ■ v i,- j It is deeply situated (A, figs. 155. 161.) in the left hypochondrium behind and to the left of the great end of the stomach, to which it is united by a fold of peritoneum, called the gastro-splenic omentum. It is also retained in its place by the peritoneum, which is reflected upon it from the diaphragm *, and by the vessels which enter and pass out from it. Being suspended rather tlian fixed to certain movable parts, the spleen necessarily participates m their movements; and the contraction or relaxation of the diaphragm, as well as the alternate distension and collapse of the stomach, exert an undoubted influence upon it; but these slight and temporary changes of position do not constitute a true displacement. _ It may even be said, that displacements of the spleen, which are very rare, are almost always congenital. Thus Haller has seen this organ situated at the left side of the bladder, in an infant one year old ; Desault has found it in the right cavity of the thorax in a foetus at the full time, I do not here aUude to cases of complete transposition of the viscera, nor to cases where the change of situation depends on enlargement of the spleen, or on displacement of the stomach, f I have mentioned elsewhere that I have found the spleen in the umbilical region. Accidental adhesions of the spleen are so frequent, that they deserve to be mentioned. They are sometimes filamentous, and sometimes cellular, and they render painful the slightest changes of position in this organ, from vio- lent contractions of the diaphragm, or from great distension of the stomach : these adhesions are almost always the sequelse of intermittent fevers; Number. The spleen is single in the human subject. The supernumerary spleens occasionally met with near it are nothing more than small ovoid or spheroidal fragments of the spleen, which at first sight might be taken for lymphatic glands. I have never seen more than two supernumerary spleens in man. It is said that they are more frequent in the foetus than in the adult: this opinion is erroneous. % It has been said that ten, twelve, and even twenty-three supernumerary spleens have been observed. Without denying the possibility of the fact, I am inclined to doubt its occurrence. As the spleen is always multiple in a great number of animals, supernumerary spleens in man may be regarded as the last trace of such an arrangement. With regard to the examples of congenital or accidental absence of the spleen mentioned by some authors, it should be remarked, that they were ac- companied with serious diseases of the abdomen, and that small adherent spleens, lost in some measure among the surrounding organs, may easily have escaped notice in a not very close examination. Size and weight. There is no organ which varies more than the spleen in regard to size and weight. These differences may be referred to the follow- ing heads:— Individual differences. It is in vain to attempt to establish a relation be- tween the size of the spleen and that of the liver, or between the size of the spleen, and the stature, weight, constitution, and habits of the individual. § * [This reflection is called the ligamentum phrenico-Uenale. The spleen is also connected by the peritoneum to the arch of the colon.] + The great end of the stomach is the most fixed part of that viscus, on account of its con., nection with the (esophagus. Changes of position in this organ affect partly the portion be- tween the pylorus .ind the cardia, and partly the pylorus itself. % It is true that a greater number of cases of supernumerary spleens in the foetus have been recorded, than in adults ; but the fact is easily explained, if we consider th.it in the fcetus su- pernumerary spleens cannot escape notice, whilst they are often diiTicult to be seen in the adult on account of tlie fat with which the omenta are loaded. ' § The spleen is proportionally larger in man than in the lower animals. It has been said as ifSPLANCHNOLOGY. Differences from phjsiological conditions. The spleen is often found small wrinkled, shrunk, or as it were withered and collapsed; a state that certainly supposes the opposite condition of distension. In other cases the spleen is large, and looks as if it were stretched. Ought we then to admit with Lieu- taud *, that the pressure from the distended state of the stomach during diges- tion diminishes the size of the spleen, which on the other hand becomes the seat of an afflux of blood in the intervals between the occurrence of that pro- cess. This idea is perhaps erroneous as far as regards the periods of collapse and turgescence ; but it is correct as to the principal fact, viz. the alternation of those two opposite conditions. Differences from age. The spleen is proportionally smaller in the foetus than in the adult, and in the adult than in the aged. Differences from disease. The morbid differences in the size of the spleen suggest most important considerations. In a great number of patients suffer- ing with intermittent fevers, more especially when this organ is already en- larged from previous attacks, it is manifestly swollen during each access. Hypertrophy of the spleen may proceed to an extraordinary extent; so that this organ, which in the natural condition is withdrawn so deeply into the left hypochondrium as not to be seen on opening the abdomen, in certain cases fills almost the whole of the abdominal cavity ; while its weight, which varies from two to eight ounces in the healthy condition, may be as much as ten, twenty, or thirty pounds; one case, indeed, has been recorded, where the spleen weighed forty-three pounds. Atrophy of the spleen is very rare. I have seen it reduced to the weight of two drachms. The specific gravity of the spleen is, to that of water, as 1160 to 1000. The spleen, both upon the surface and in the interior, most commonly re- sembles in colour the dark lees of wine. This colour, however, presents many varieties from a deep brown red to a pale grey. When the surface has been some time exposed to the air, it becomes bright red, like the surface of venous blood soon after its abstraction. Age, the kind of death, and diseases, have much effect on the colour of this organ, the different parts of which are not always of a uniform tint. I have seen a spleen of a deep chesnut brown hue. Consistence. One character of the tissue of the spleen is its extreme fri- ability. In general it may be lacerated by the pressure of the finger, to which it commimicates a feeling of crepitation, and emits a sound, like the crackling produced by bending tin. The spleen may be regarded as the most friable of all organs excepting the brain. Thus examples have been recorded of its laceration from blows, or falls upon the abdomen, and even from a general concussion, or from the contraction of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles during violent exertion, &c. The consistence of the spleen also varies much in different individuals, and in diseases ; indeed, the most important alterations of this organ may be re- ferred to either increased or diminished consistence. In induration, which is o-enerally accompanied with hypertrophy, the tissue of the spleen is compact, brittle, and dry,- and breaks like a piece of compact resin. In softening, carried to its highest degree, the spleen is converted into an inorganic pulp, exactly resembling a healthy spleen broken down by the fingers, and contain- ing a greater quantity of fluid than natural. This state is often observed after it .were possible to establish a relation between two such variable terms as the weight of the spleen and the body, that the former is ^th of the latter. * Lieutaud asserts that he has constantly found the spleen larger when death has occurred whilst dieestion was going on in the stomach, th.m when it has happened after that process had been completed ; but the spleen varies so much in size, tliat we cannot compare the spleen of one subject with that of another. An nigenious expcrunent has been made the result ot which is opposed to Lieutaud's opinion : out of four newly born puppies, bclongmg to the same litter, two were Itept without food, whilst to tlie other two milk was given: on kUUng tiiem tlieir spleens were all found of the same size.THE SPLEEN. 537 malignant fevers* and when the membranes are torn, the substance of the spleen escapes spontaneously. _ . ^. , . Fiqure The spleen has a crescentic form; its long diameter is vertical, its concavity directed to the right, and its convexity to the left side. It may be compared, as was done by HaUer, to a segment of an elhpse cut longitudinally. It presents for consideration an external and an internal surjace, and a cir- Ctlttl fCTCTlCB The external or costal surface is convex, smooth, and in relation with the diaphragm, which separates it from the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs f; hence arises the influence of contractions of the diaphragm upon the spleen, and the possibility of its being ruptured during a violent effort. This relation also accounts for the pain felt in the region of the spleen after quick running, and the difficulty and pain attendant on a strong inspiration made whilst running by persons in whom the spleen is hypertrophied. "We frequently find a prolongation of the liver abnost completely covering the external surface of the spleen. The internal or gastric surface is concave in all directions, and presents, at the junction of the two anterior thirds with the posterior, a somewhat irregular series of openings, which are themselves irregular in form and number, are sit- uated at greater or less intervals, and arranged longitudinally. This row of openings is called the fissure, or hilus {h,fig. 154.), of the spleen. The gastro- splenic omentum is attached near this fissure. Some varieties are observed in the arrangement of the internal surface of the spleen. Thus, it sometimes pre- sents an uniform concavity, and sometimes there is a sort of projecting ridge opposite the hilus, which divides it into two unequal parts, one anterior and larger, the other posterior and smaller: in the latter case, which is common, the spleen is of a prismatic and triangular form. The following are the relations of the internal surface : — the part situated in front of the hilus has relations with the great cul-de-sac of the stomach, and, on the right and behind this cul-de-sac, with the gastro-splenic omentum and the vasa brevia situated within it: the left extremity of the liver, which, as we have seen occasionally, covers the external surface of the spleen, is more fre- quently in relation with the internal surface of that organ. Behind the hilus the spleen corresponds with the left kidney, suprarenal capsule, and pillar of the diaphragm, which separate it from the spine, and with the small extremity of the pancreas. The circumference is elliptical; its posterior border is thicker above than be- low, and is in relation with the kidney, which it sometimes covers through its entire length ; its anterior border is thinner, and is applied to the stomach ; its upper extremity is thick, often bent upon itself, and in contact with the diaphragm, from which however it is occasionally separated by the liver; its inferior ex- tremity is pointed, and rests upon the angle formed by the transverse and descending colon, or upon the portion of transverse mesocolon, which sup- ports that angle. The circumference of the spleen is notched, and sometimes marked more or less deeply by fissures, which are prolonged upon both its surfaces, particularly upon the external surface, and which divide it into a greater or less number of distinct lobules. This lobular arrangement is the last indication of the multiple spleens, of which we have already spoken. The description of the relations just given applies when the stomach is empty; when that viscus is distended, they are somewhat different. The spleen, which before was separated from the stomach by the gastro-splenic omentum, is then applied directly to it, and is moulded upon it, so as it were to cover its walls. It has no longer any relations with the kidney and the vertebral column, but * Vide Atiat. Path.avec. planches, liv. ii.,art. Maladies de la Rate.

Structure. Besides two investing membranes, one serous, the other fi- brous *, the spleen consists of cells having fibrous parietes, and filled with a grumous fluid t of the colour of port wine dregs, of certain corpuscules not very distinct in the human subject, of a very large artery and still larger vein and of lymphatic vessels and nerves. ' The serous or peritoneal coat invests the whole spleen with the exception of the hilus, which corresponds to the gastro-splenic omentum. It gives a smooth appearance to the spleen, lubricates its surface, and, at the same time, fixes it to the neighbouring parts by the bands which it forms. Its internal surface adheres closely to the fibrous membrane. The proper coat of the spleen forms a sort of fibrous shell, which is strong notwithstanding its tenuity and transparency. This membrane is the seat of those cartilaginous plates which are so often found upon its surface, and which conceal its true colour. It is intimately united to the peritoneal membrane by its outer surface, and adheres still more closely by its inner surface to the tissue of the spleen by means of exceedingly numerous and dense fibrous pro- longations, which penetrate it in all directions, and interlace in every way, so as to form areolae or cells, the arrangement of which we shall hereafter examine. Further, the proper coat is not perforated at the hilus for the passage of the vessels ; but by an arrangement similar to that already no- ticed in the liver, it is reflected around the vessels opposite the hilus, like the capsule of Glisson, and is prolonged upon both the arteries and veins, forming sheaths which divide and subdivide like the vessels themselves, and receive the prolongations given off from the inner surface of the proper coat. This arrangement has been very well described by Delasonne (^M6m. Acad, des Sciences, 1754), and especially by Dupuytren (These de M. Assolant). It follows, therefore, that the basis of the spleen is composed of a fibrous struc- ture, consisting of an investing fibrous membrane, of fibrous sheaths which accompany the vessels in their divisions and subdivisions even to their ter- minations, and of prolongations arising from the inner surface of the mem- brane, interlacing in all directions, and attached to the outer surface of the sheaths. % The internal framework of the spleen is, therefore, an areolar tissue, which may be very well displayed by washing away the pulpy matter of this viscus by means of a stream of water; there will then remain a whitish areolar and spongy tissue. This is also very clearly shown by injecting it either with mercury or some coloured liquid, or even by inflating it with air blown through a puncture. The coats are then raised in different places, and after desic- cation the areolar structure becomes evident. This experiment also shows that the spleen is divided into a number of compartments, for without rupture only a small portion of the organ can be injected in this way. It appears then that the proper tissue of the spleen is composed of an areolar fibrous network and of a pultaceous matter, of the colour of port wine lees, — the splenic juice or matter, regarded by the ancients as one of the fundamental humours of the body called atra bills, and which modern chemists have not yet sufliciently examined. We have now to determine the arrangement of the cells, and the relation between these cells and the arteries, veins, and nerves. The splenic artery. No organ of so small a size, receives so large an ar- * See note, infra. t See note, p. 539. . I [This basis or framework is more or less developed in the different species of animals: it is much stronger in the horse than in the ox. The proper coat of the spleen, together with the sheaths for the vessels, and the prolongations or trabecula; given off from it, are highly elastic, and are generally stated to consist of yellow elastic tissue, not of ordmary fibrous tissue.]THE SPLEEN. 539 tery. The splenic artery is in fact the largest branch of the coeliac axis, and, on this account, ruptures or wounds of the spleen are almost always foUowed by fatal hemorrhage. It is also remarkable for its tortuous course; when re- duced to half its origmal size, from having given off several branches, it enters the spleen by four or five branches at greater or less distances from each other. These branches divide in the usual manner in the substance of the organ, and preserve their tortuous character even to their terminations. One peculiarity well worthy of attention is, that the arteries constantly divide in a radiating manner, so that air, or water, or tallow, thrown into one arterial di- vision, does not pass into the branches of the others. This mode of division is observed not only in the larger, but also in the smaller arteries*, so that the spleen may be considered as an aggregate of a considerable number of smaU spleens, united together by a common investment; and accordingly, if in a living animal one division of the splenic artery be tied, the portion of the spleen to which it is distributed becomes bUghted, whilst the rest remains in the natural state. This arrangement of the arteries may be shown in a very striking manner by injecting their several divisions with differently coloured substances. The injected matters will not mix, and the line of demarcation between the lobes will become evident. This structure explains how multiple spleens may occur in man and the lower animals, and why there are so many varieties in this respect in the animal series. Some branches from the splenic, lumbar, and spermatic arteries enter the spleen through the folds of the peritoneum. The splenic vein is four or five times larger than the artery : it forms one of the principal roots of the vena portae, and is almost equal to the other root formed by the superior mesenteric vein. The venous communication between the spleen and the liver has, in a great measure, given rise to the opinion that they are connected in function. The spleen is fiUed by the numberless and large divisions of this vein; it might even be said that the texture of the spleen is essentially venous, that it is composed of a venous plexus or an erectile tissue, and that it bears the same relation to the veins that the lymphatic glands do to the lymphatic vessels. All the splenic cells communicate with the veins, or rather they are nothing more than these veins themselves sup- ported by the fibrous colimins and sheaths already described: this is shown by the following considerations and experiments : — 1. If, according to the exa:mple of Delasonne f, we examine the spleen of the ox by laying open the splenic veins and their divisions by means of a grooved director, we shall find that these veins are almost immediately reduced to their lining membrane, and perforated with very distinctly formed foramina, through which the dafk reddish brown splenic matter is visible. These foramina soon become so numerous, that the veins are converted into cavities or cells, the walls of which are perforated with openings of various sizes, filled with the splenic pulp. This arrangement, which is most manifest under water, proves that the tissue of the spleen is composed of venous cells J, like the corpora ca- vernosa of the penis. In man, the horse, and the dog, the great veins are not perforated with foramina, but the cellular and areolar arrangement of the splenic veins at a certain depth is not less manifest. 2. If we inject the splenic artery, the spleen will become very slightly in- creased in bulk at first, i.e. as long as the injected matter does not pass into the venous system; but as soon as this occurs, and it does so readily, the increase » [The minute arteries ramify In tufts, or penicilli.] subject'^""""" '•«'5<="''ed the structure of the spleen in the ox as belonging to the human to Mr Kiernan these venous cells are lateral dilatations, which communicate wi h the venous trunlc by sma 1 branches.

We can very seldom meet with a human spleen sufficiently healthy, for the following experiment. It will succeed perfectly with the spleen of a horse, which is of a much denser structure. The spleen ought in the first place to be freed from the liquid which it contains ; this must be accomplished by forcing water into the splenic artery. The water will return by the veins, at first turbid, then merely tinged, and at last limpid and pure.f I have in vain attempted to force the injection from the veins into the arteries. After tlie water, air should be blown into the artery, so as to empty the spleen as much as possible of any liquid which it may contain. If we examine a spleen thus freed of its contained matter, we observe that it is wrinkled and as it were shrivelled on the surface, and remarkably dimi- nished in bulk; and on making a section of it, we find a white spongy tissue, composed of laminae or fibres interlacing in every direction. The following preparation J exhibits this structure most fully :—The spleen of a horse, prepared in the way I have indicated above, and weighing one pound, could receive ten pounds of tallow. The injection was thrown in by the veins : at each stroke of the piston, the spleen swelled up readily, an evident proof that the splenic cells communicate directly with the veins ; while in order to obtain the same effect by injecting through the arteries, very considerable force was required. The injection of the spleen by the veins did not take place in an uniform manner, but successively; in one injection, the upper part was injected before the lower, and the anterior border before the posterior. The independence of different portions of the spleen on each other exists in regard to their veins as well as their arteries. I have been enabled to observe the resistance offered by the tissue of the spleen to the distending power ; a re- sistance which caused the injection to flow back whenever the impelling force was discontinued. The cells are extensible to a certaili degree, beyond which they resist very powerfully : it does not appear that they possess any elasticity. § After some days when desiccation was complete, the spleen thus injected was divided into several portions, which were then immersed in spirits of tur- pentine moderately heated. The tallow by which all the cells were distended, and which had taken the place of their contentb, having been dissolved out, the sections presented a spongy, areolar structure, like that of erectile tis- sue, as found in the corpora cavernosa, or the substance of the placenta: and this cannot be considered, as Meckel would have it, as the artificial result of the insufflation and injection, which lacerate, as he believes,'a part of the * It has been erroneously asserted that the communication between the artery and vein is more direct in the spleen than in any other organ. The great anastomoses, visible to the naked eye between the splenic artery and vein, admitted by Spigelius, Diemerbroeck, Bartholin, and others is purely imaginary. The precise mode of communication is still unknown. + This injection which requires considerable force, continued without interruption for a lone time occasions an exudation of a perfectly transparent fluid upon the surface of the <inlpRn even when the water returned by the vein is still turbid. Here we have an imitation of in pxh'alant process. And as this transudation takes place without rupture, it is evident that there are a set of vessels by which it is efifected.* Instead of making an injection, which is alwavs troublesome, we may attach the splenic artery to a tube, which is itself adapted to ■ nofher tube running from the bottom of a cistern ; the column of water will overcome the resistance offered to its passage from the arteries into the veins, and in twenty-four hours it raode^f prem suggested to me by the plan adopted with the corpora ca- vernosa nv Bogros; prosector to the Faculty, who died a victim to Ins zea for science.

This spongy cellular structure explains why the spleen, as well as the corpora cavernosa is susceptible of such great variations in bulk ; and why it is sometimes found collapsed and wrinkled", and sometimes distended, and as it were swollen. Are the splenic cells Uned by the internal membrane of the veins? if so, the mem- brane is so thin as to be incapable of demonstration. . . . ^, , Corpuscules of the spleen. Malpighi described, as existing in the spleen, certain corpuscules, regarded by him as the prmcipal elements in this orgun, and believed by him to effect some important changes m the splenic blood. These corpuscules, which Ruysch considered to be essentially vascular, have been again brought into notice by Delasonne, who demonstrated them by maceration. HaUer denied their glandular nature, because, as he said, there can be no glands where there is no secretion and no excretory ducts. The question is not, how- ever whether these corpuscules are glands or not, but rather whether they exist at all. It is certain that in many animals, in the dog and the cat for example, a great number of granules may be seen scattered through the spleen, and which, according to a calculation, the accuracy of which I do not guarantee, woidd seem to form two fifths of the weight of the organ. These corpuscules are soft, whitish or reddish, and vary in diameter from a fourth of a line to a line. They do not appear to me to exist in man.* The lymphatic vessels of the spleen are divided into the superficial and deep. The superficial only are well known ; a certain number pass from the spleen to the stomach ; they all terminate in lymphatic glands situated opposite the' hilus, within the layers of the gastro-splenic omentum. Nerves. The nerves are derived from the solar plexus, and are termed the splenic plexus. It has been stated that some terminal divisions of the pneu- mogastric have been seen distributed upon the spleen. Several of the nerves are remarkable for their size, which enables us to examine in them the peculiar structure of the ganglionic nerves, and also to trace the splenic nerves them- selves deeply into the substance of the organ.f We are completely ignorant of their mode of termination. As to the proper ducts of the spleen, said to pass directly from that organ to the great cul-de-sac of the stomach, or even to the duodenum, and to pour into these parts a peculiar liquid, it may be confidently stated that they are purely imaginary. And again, the three kinds of vascular communication between the spleen and the stomach cannot in any way explain the afflux of liquids from the spleen to t]ie stomach ; in fact, the arterial vasa brevia of the stomach are given off from the splenic artery before it reaches tte spleen ; nor do the venous vasa brevia enter the splenic vein until after it has left the hilus of the spleen ; the lymphatic vessels alone pass directly from the spleen to the stomach, but they are superficial, and have no connection with the splenic cells. There is no cellular tissue, properly so called, in the spleen, which never- theless is liable to inflammation. Developement. In opposition to the liver, the spleen is smaller in proportion as it is examined nearer the period of conception. It appears late ; it begins to be distinguishable towards the end of the second month, and it then resem- bles a clot of blood. I have never seen it developed from separate lobules, * [The corpuscules here described are not those discovered by Malpighi, but large soft greyish bodies, rarely found in the human spleen, and tlie nature of which is not understood. The Malpigliian corpuscules are much smaller ; they are very evident in the ox, sheep, and pig; they lie in the red pulpy matter externally to the venous cells, and are attached by short pe- dicles, or without pedicles, to the minute arteries, which, however, have not otlierwise any special relation to them ; they contain greyisli granules, similar in size and form to those of the red pulpy miitter. In the human spleen they are very difficult to distinguish. The extremities of the divided trabecula; may be mistaken for white corpuscules.] t The sensibility of the spleen is very important.

It is therefore extremely probable, that the spleen perforins an important office in the abdominal venous system; but what this oflice is we do not know ; and what tends to confound aU our calculations is, that extirpation of this organ in animals does not seem to have any marked eflect upon their health, that the most complete atrophy of the spleen is consistent with the most regular performance of all the functions, and that hy- pertrophy even to such a degree that the organ occupies ahnost the whole ot the abdomen, merely produces a discolouration of the skin, diminished nutrition, and, in young subjects, an arrest of growth. The spongy and vascular texture of the spleen, and the absence of valves, which aUows the venous blood to regiu-gitate into the spleen when there is any obstacle to the circulation, has led to the opinion that the spleen is nothing more than a diverticulum intended to restore the equilibrium of the abdominal venous system whenever it is deranged; and this opinion, which we owe to Haller, is pretty generally admitted.! A modification of this opinion is, that the spleen fulfils, with regard to the circulation in general, and especially to the abdominal circulation, the office of the safety-tube of Wolf in chemical apparatus. It is certain that compression of the splenic vein in a living animal causes tumefaction of the spleen, which gives place to a quick collapse, as if by elastic contraction, when the pressure on the vein is removed : it is certain that the whole structure of the spleen indicates that this organ may undergo alterations of expansion and tm-gescence and of collapse and flaccidity ; and it is known, that, during intermittent fever, the spleen may be felt below the false ribs, &c. But all this leads to presumptions, and not to certainty. From the preceding considerations it would follow, that the spleen is only an accessory organ. ' * We cannot state with Malpighl, that the spleen is the preparatory organ of the bile, be- cause we have seen that it is extremely probable that the liver is concerned in the process of sanguification. t May we not quote in support of this view, the pain felt in the region gf the spleen, after violent running, which can only be referred to extreme distension of this organ.THE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION. General observations.-The Lungs and Pleura. - The Trachea and Bronchi -Developement of the lungs.-The Larynx-its structure, developement, and functions.—The Thyroid gland. After describing the digestive apparatus, the object of which is to elaborate solid and Uquid materials for the reparation of the waste that occurs in the body, and at the same time to present a vast surface for the absorption of those materials, we naturally turn to the consideration of the apparatus of respiration, the object of which is to renew the vital properties of the blood by the action of atmospheric air in the lungs. This latter apparatus, which is much less complex than the former, is com- posed, 1. of the lungs, the essential organs of respiration ; 2. of the thorax, a cavity forming a sort of bellows, and having walls capable of alternately ex- panding and contracting ; 3. of a tubular apparatus, by which the lungs com- municate with the external air, and which consists of the bronchi, trachea, larynx, pharynx, and nasal fosses; for it is only accidentally, so to speak, and in order to render respiration more certain, that air is allowed to pass through the mouth. The thorax has been already described (see Osteology and Myology), and also the pharynx, which is common to both the respiratory and digestive passages. The nasal fossae, situated at the entrance of the respiratory passages, form the natural passages for the introduction of the air, and at the same time serve for the reception of the organ of smeU, by which sense we may consider the qualities of the air are examined. Their bony framework^ has been al- ready described under osteology. The pituitary membrane which covers the irregular surfaces of these fossae will be described in the article devoted to the organs of the senses; we shall only consider, in this place, the lungs, the trachea, and the larynx. The Lungs. The lungs (jpulmones; irveu^wi/, from wew, to breathe; p p,figs. 155.170, 171.) are the essential organs of respiration. WhUst the presence of an alimentary canal is the attribute of all animals, that of lungs is limited to those ver- tebrata which live in the air, different modes of respiration prevailing in the other classes. Number. The lungs are two in number; but as the air which penetrates them is received from one tube, and the blood circulating through them is de- rived from one vascular trunk, they must be regarded as separated parts of a single organ; by ihis arrangement, respiration is rendered certain, and its unity maintained. Situation. The lungs are situated (p p, fg. \55.) in the thoracic cavity, which is in a great measure occupied by them, and effectually protects them from the action of external agents ; they are placed on each side of the heart (/i, figs. 155. n-e, 171.), with which physiologically they are so directly con- nected ; they are separated from each other by the mediastinum (m) ; hence the independence of the two cavities in which they are contained. Being separated by the diaphragm from the stomach, the liver, and all the other ab- dominal organs, they are so inclosed in all directions as not to be liable to dis- placements, or rather such displacements are only partial, and due to a loss of substance in the walls of the cavity in which they are placed. Size. The size of the lungs necessarily corresponds exactly with theSPLANCHNOLOGY. capacity of the thorax, and therefore, like it, is subject to variations; and as on the one hand, the size of the lung is generaUy a measure of the energy of respiration, and, on the other, the energy of respiration is a measure of the muscular strength, one cannot be astonished that a capacious chest, coinciding with broad shoulders, should be the characteristic of a sanguine temperament and athletic constitution. In the natural state there is neither air nor watery fluid between the parietes ot the thorax and the surface of the lung. The absence of air or other fluid may be shown after death as weU as upon a living animal, by raising the inter- costal muscle from the costal pleura, so as to preserve the latter *, or by removing the muscular fibres of the diaphragm. It is then seen that the lung is alwayi m contact with the parietes of the chest; in some subjects it even appears as if ready to escape ; but scarcely is the thorax opened when the lungs instan- taneously collapse, in consequence of the expulsion of the air from their inte- rior. It is very common to find a small quantity of serum in the cavity of the pleura, but it is probable that this fluid did not exist during life. There is no space to be filled up here as in the cranium. The differences in the size of the lungs depend, 1. on the state of inspiration or expiration. Attempts have been made to determine the difference from this cause by estimating the volume of air inspired or expired; it is about thirty cubic inches, and may be increased to forty in forced inspiration or expiration : 2. on age ; thus, in the foetus, the lungs are relatively much smaller than after birth ; 3. on some morbid condition. The lungs diminish in size, ■when the abdominal viscera encroach, upou the thorax, either in ascites, in pregnancy, or in diseases of the liver, which organ has been found in some cases to become enlarged entirely by encroaching on the chest, and to extend as high up as the second rib. They diminish also when the heart is enlarged in aneurism, or when a large quantity of fluid is accumulated in the pericardium. In effusions into the thorax, the fluid takes the place of the lung; the latter gradually wastes, and is reduced to such a thin lamina, or to so small a mass, that it has sometimes been overlooked in a superficial examination ; but if in such cases air be blown into the trachea, the organ appears of its full size, and gradually fills the remainder of the cavity. This extreme diminution of the lung without any alteration of its substance, proves that the size of the organ is essentially dependent upon the air within it. Attempts have been made to calculate exactly the quantity of air contained in the cavity of the lungs, or, in other words, the capacity of these organs : according to one estimate, which can only be regarded as an approximation to the truth, it would seem to be about 110 cubic inches after expiration, and 140 inches after an ordinary in- spiration. When an effusion in the thorax has been very slowly absorbed, the lung of the affected side remains atrophied, and the thoracic cavity contracted, whilst the other lung acquires a very considerable size, so that the mediastinum is pushed to one side, and the healthy lung passes beyond the median line, f In certain cases of acute pneumonia, and in rickets affecting the thorax, we often see one of the lungs reduced to very small dimensions, whilst the other is very much enlarged, f The size of the two lungs is not absolutely the same. In consequence of the heart projecting into the left cavity of the thorax, the transverse diameter of the left lung is not equal to that of the right; and on account of the projection of the liver into the right cavity, the vertical diameter of the right lung is less than that of the left. After allowing for these facts, the difference is in favour * In order to demonstrate the absence of air, we may also repeat another experiment per- formed by Ilaller, wliich consists in opening the thorax of a dead body under water. t In a case of chronic induration of tlie left lung the deviation of the mediastinum was so great, that the right lung was in relation with the lel"t costal cartilages. t The lungs become less increased in size from inflammation, than most other organs ; luul this peculiarity is explained by the vesicular structure of the lung, the increase in size benig effected at the expense of the cavity of the air-vesicles.THE LUNGS, 545 of the right hmg. In determining the size of the lungs, we must hear in mind, that the lung as well as the thoracic cavity gains in one direction what it loses in another: elongated lungs, which are regarded as particularly liable to phthisis, have not seemed to me to be smaller than the lungs of a person of similar stature but having a broad chest. The weight of the lungs must be examined with reference to their specific gravity and to their absolute weight. The specific gravity of the lungs is less than that of any other organ, and even much less than that of water. Their lightness depends on the great quantity of air which penetrates them in every direction, so that the lungs rise to the surface of the fluid in which they are im- mersed. The specific gravity of the lungs presents some important differences depending on age. Thus, before birth, and in an infant that has died during- birth without having respired, the lungs sink in water; on the contrary, they swim when the infant has breathed ; not because any change has taken place in the intrinsic nature of the organ, but because the air has insinuated itself into the cells. The estimation of the specific weight of the lungs constitutes what is called in legal medicine the hydrostatic test. In the adult the lung always floats, notwithstanding any efforts which may be made to expel the air contained in the pulmonary cells; it seems as if the air enters in some way into the composition of the lung, and even in vacuo it cannot be completely extracted. The specific gravity of the lungs varies also from disease. Thus, lungs infiltrated with serum, or indurated by inflammation, being completely or partially deprived of air, on the presence of which their lightness depends, assume, in a greater or less degree, the appearance of compact organs, such as the liver or the spleen. The absolute weight of the lung varies from similar causes. From age : thus, although the specific gravity of the foetal lung is much greater than that of the adult, yet its absolute weight is considerably less. In infants that have not breathed, the weight of the body is to that of the lungs as 60 to 1 on an average, whilst in those that have breathed, the proportion is as 30 to 1, so that the changes in the lungs resulting from respiration are such as to double their weight. We may easily conceive the great importance of this fact in legal medicine. This method of estimating the weight of the lungs is known by the name of the static test. The absolute weight of the lungs varies much in disease. Healthy lungs are very light; diseased lungs may become eight or ten times heavier than natural, without increasing in size. The lungs almost always becoming engorged at their posterior border during the last moments of life, their weight must not be estimated from an ordinary corpse. It must undoubtedly have been from the examination of engorged lungs that authors have stated their average weight to be four pounds. Colour. The colour of the lungs varies according to age and disease. In the fcetus they are reddish-brown ; after birth rosy white ; in the adult and in the aged they are greyish-blue, and amost always marked by black spots, form- ing pomts, lines, or patches, and describing polygons more or less regular in figure. These black patches, which become much more numerous in advanced age, co-exist with the black deposits in the bronchial glands, and probably depend upon the same cause ; they lie below the serous covering of the lungs, and are very superficial, excepting in disease. The posterior part of the lung IS usuaUy of a reddish-brown colour, because it is distended with blood and serum. It has not been shown that this is altogether a post mortem con- dition, and the necessary consequence of the position of the corpse upon its back; many facts would, on the contrary, induce us to admit that it occurs antecedently to death. Density, crepitation, and cohesion. The lung, a spongy or aerial organ so to speak, is the least dense of aU the organs in the body; it yields to the pressure of the hand, and, if no cause prevents the escape of the air, it loses very much of its original size. I have remarked, when speaking of the spleen that, under pressure, that organ emitted a peculiar noise, or rather gave dse to VOL. I. N NSPLANCHNOLOGY. a sensation which might be compared to the crackling of tin, and that this sound was the result of rupture of the fibrous prolongations which traverse its tissue. Pressure of the lung causes a sensation and a sound somewhat analogous to the preceding ; this sound is called crepitation. It may, in fact, be compared to the sound produced by the decrepitation of salt, or the rattling of paper. This crepitati(m is only observed under a moderate pressure, and if the sensation communicated be strictly noted, we shall find that it is the feeling of a resistance overcome. On careful examination of the portion of lung which has thus crepitated, bubbles of air are found under the pleura; in fact, emphysema is produced. Notwithstanding its slight density, the tissue of the lungs possesses tolerable strength; it resists laceration 'to a certain point; and all its parts are pretty firmly bound together. Resistance to distension. The lung, though it yields to the finger without recovering itself at all, or only very imperfectly, is yet possessed of great elasticity, but such an elasticity as is in harmony with its functions. It also offers powerful resistance to any distending force. Thus, if a stopcock be adapted to the trachea of a dead body, and the lungs be inflated by means of bellows having double valves, the puhnonary tissue becomes extremely tense and hard; the eflFort necessary to rupture some of the air-cells and produce emphysema, is surprising. In opposition to those authors who speak of the dangers of artificial insufflation of the lungs of asphyxiated persons, I have in vain endeavoured with all the force I could employ in expiration, to pro- duce a laceration of some of the pulmonary cells: and how, it may be asked, without great means of opposing every attempt to dilate them beyond measure, could the lungs resist the force to which they are subjected during violent ex- ertions ? Elasticity. The lungs are very elastic, i. e. they have a constant tendency to collapse, and to free themselves of part of the air contained in their cells. It is this elasticity which maintains the vaulted form of the diaphragm after the abdomen has been opened, and occasions the lung to collapse suddenly, when an opening is made in the parietes of the thorax: before the chest is opened, the atmospheric pressure operating through the trachea, prevents the elasticity of the lungs from being brought into action.* This elasticity is also shown by the quick collapse of inflated lungs. I have been accustomed to demonstrate in my lectures, perfectly healthy lungs preserved in alcohol. After having shown how far the inflation of the lungs may be carried, I open the stopcock used in the experiment, and the limgs instantly collapse, driving out the air with considerable force. Shape and relations. The lungs are shaped like an irregular cone, deeply excavated on the inner side, with the base below and the apex above ; they present for consideration an external and an internal surface, an anterior and a posterior border, a base, and an apex. Outer or costal surface. This surface is irregularly convex, corresponding to the concavity of the thoracic parietes with which it is in contact, and on which it is exactly moulded; it is in relation with the costal pleura, which separates it from the ribs and the intercostal muscles. It presents a deep fissure, the interlobular fissure, which penetrates the entire thickness of the lung as far as the root. This fissure commences below the apex of the lung (v',fig. 171.), passes downwards and forwards {v',fig. 170.) as far as the an- terior part of the base, upon which it encroaches a little at its termination. It is simple in the left lung (u ), but is bifurcated in front in the right; the lower division of this bifurcation continues in the original direction ; the upper division {w) passes upwards and forwards. The left lung, therefore, is divided into two portions or lohes, distinguished as the superior («') and the * FTlIe luncs do not collapse until the chest is opened, because the atmospheric pressure is exerted onlti on the inner surface of the lungs, their outer surface beiiig protected from it hy the unyielding parietes of the tliorax.

N N 2 inferior (a'); while the right is divided into three lu/ie.s, the superior (s), the in- ferior and the middle (<). Of these lobes the inferior, comprising the base of the lung, is larger than the superior, -which forms the apex: the middle lobe is the smallest. The contiguous sur- faces of these lobes are plane, and covered bj' the pleura: they are often adherent,and sometimes puru- lent matter collects between them, and being surrounded on all sides by ad- hesions, it hollows out, as it were, a , cavity for itself, at ' the expense of the correspondingsur- faces of the lobes, and thus simu- lates an abscess of the lung. There are many varieties in the ar- rangement of these lobes. Thus, some- times the fissures, and more especially those which bound the middle lobe, do not reach as far as the root of the lungs, but are only slightly indicated. Three lobes are not unfrequently found in the left lung, or four in the right; there were four lobes m the lung of a negro lately presented to the anatomical society. _ Examples are on record of lungs with five, six, and even seven lobes, but in general this multiplicity of lobes is only rudimentary, and represents the normal condition in the majority of animals. The dog, the sheep, and the ox nave seven lobes in their lungs. Inner or mediastinal surface. This corresponds to the mediastinum (pp). On It we observe the root (r) of the lungs, that is, the part at which they communicate with the trachea, through the bronchi, and receive and emit their bloodvessels. This root occupies a very limited space upon the inner surface, one inch in height, and half an inch in breadth; it is situated at the junction of the posterior with the two anterior thirds of this surface, at an almost equal distance from the apex and the base. That part of the inner surface of the lung which is behind the root, cor- responds to the vertebral column and the posterior mediastinum, in which are tound on the left side, the descending aorta and the upper part of the tho- racic duct and on the right side, the vena azygos, the oesophagus, and the lower part of the thoracic duct. f b > All that portion of the inner surface which is in front of the root, corre- sponds with the anterior mediastinum, and is excavated to receive the heart (1) ■ tW fLtl , P^.-'f *° '^^^ than to the right side, it follows that the left lung, which corresponds to the left border and apex of the heart and higher up to the arch of the aorta (g), is more deeply excavated than the548 SPLANCHNOLOGY. nght lung which corresponds to the right auricle (m) and the vena cava su- perior(see^5r. 170.). We can obtain an accurate idea of the manner in which the lungs are excavated for the reception of the heart, only by examininir them when inflated; we are then struck with the propriety of the expression of Avicenna, who called the lung the bed of the heart. We can also under- stand how diseases accompanied with enlargement of the heart may directly influence the respiration, by reducing the size of the lungs. These organs, it may be remarked, are here in apposition with the heart through the me- dium of the pericardium and the pleura. I should not omit to mention their relation with the phrenic nerve, which is affixed closely to the pericar- dium by the pleura. In the foetus the lungs are in relation anteriorly with the thymus gland, which presses them backwards. The anterior border is thin and sinuous, presenting on the left side two notches, one inferior and very large, corresponding to the apex of the heart; the other superior and small, for the subclavian artery. On the right side there are also two notches, but smaller than those on the left; an inferior for the right auricle, and a superior for the vena cava superior. The posterior border {fig. 171.) is the thickest part of the lung. It fills the deep costo-vertebral groove situated at each side of the dorsal portion of the spine. The base is concave, and exactly moulded upon the convexity of the dia- phragm (x, fig. 170.); it is therefore a little more excavated on the right, than on the left side. Its circumference is very thin, and slightly sinuous. Like the diaphragm, the base of the lung forms an inclined plane from before backwards and downwards ; and it occupies the deep angular groove formed behind, between the diaphragm and the parietes of the thorax. On account of this obliquity of its base, the vertical diameter of the lung is much greater behind than in front; and as the posterior border is the largest part of the organ, it may be conceived that an examination of the lung should be directed chiefly to this part. It is of importance to form a correct idea of the manner in which the base of the right lung and the convexity of the liver are ar- ranged with regard to each other. The liver is, as it were, received into the concavity of the base of the lung so completely, that the posterior part of this base is almost on a level with the lower surface of the liver. The relation of the liver with the base of the lung, which is only separated from it by the diaphragm, explains how abscesses and cysts of the liver may burst into the lung. The apex is obtuse, and projects above the first rib, a very strongly marked impression of which is found on its anterior surface. I have observed that the height of the portion which passes above the first rib varies in different subjects. In several I found it from an inch to an inch and a half. In an aged female, in whom the base of the thorax was extremely constricted, the apex of the lung (i. e. the part bounded below by the depression corresponding to the first rib) was two inches in height. May not the mechanical pressure of the inner edge of the first rib upon the apex of the lung exercise some influence in the very frequent developement of tubercles in that region ? In order to form a correct idea of the apex of the lung, that organ must be pre- viously inflated. The whole surface of the lung is free, smooth, and moistened with serum; it is connected with the rest of the body only by its root, which attaches it to the bronchi and the heart, and by a fold of the pleura. It is very rare to meet with lungs free from adhesions upon their surface, so that the older ana- tomists regarded these adhesions, whether filamentous or otherwise, as natural formations.THE LUNGS. 549 N N 3 Structure of the Lungs. On examining the structure of the hmgs, we find in each an investing membrane or serous sac, formed by the pleura, and a proper tissue. We shall commence with the pleura. The Pleura. Dissection. In order to obtain a view of the costal pleura, saw through the six or seven upper ribs behind, near their angles; cut through the cartilages of the same ribs, at a distance of some lines from their sternal articulations ; remove the intermediate portions of ribs and intercostal muscles with great care, so as to leave the costal pleura untouched. The cavity of the pleura may be inflated. In order to see the mediastinal and pulmonary portions, the costal pleura must be opened, and its continuity traced. The pleura (ir\evpa, the side) is a serous membrane, and therefore a shut sac, which is extended partly over the parietes of the thorax, and partly over the lungs. There are two pleurae, one for the right and the other for the left lung. The following is their general arrangement: — The pleura lines the parietes of the thorax, the ribs, and the diaphragm, forming the pleura costalis (pp,fig. and pleura diaphragmatica; it invests the entire surface of the lung, constituting a sort of integument for it, and forming the pleura pulmonalis : lastly, it is applied to the pleura of the opposite side, so as to form a septum between the two lungs ; this part is the medias- tinal pleura. In order to facilitate the description of the pleura, we shall suppose it to commence at a certain point; and then following its course without interruption, shall trace it back to the point from which we started. If we thus commence at the sternum, we shall find that it lines the internal surface of the thorax, being applied to the ribs and the intercostal muscles, and covering the mam- mary vessels and lymphatic glands in front, the intercostal vessels and nerves behind, and the ganglia of the great sympathetic opposite the heads of the ribs : below, it is reflected upon the diaphragm, and covers the whole of its upper surface : above, it is reflected beneath the first rib, and terminates in a cul-de-sac, intended for the reception of the apex of the lung, and pro- jecting more or less above that rib. Having reached the sides of the vertebral column, the two pleurae are re- flected forwards as far as the root of the corresponding lung, and form, by their approximation, a septum, which is called the posterior mediastinum. This septum contains within it the aorta, the oesophagus, the pneumogastric nerves, the thoracic duct, the vena azygos, a considerable quantity of cellular tissue, a great number of lymphatic glands, and the trachea. We see then that the two pleurae are by no means in immediate contact. Arrested, as it were, by the root of the lungs, the pleura is reflected out- wards behind that pedicle, passes over a small portion of the pericardium, covers all that part of the inner surface of the lungs which is behind its root, and also its posterior border and its outer surface, dips into the interlobular fissure, so as completely to invest the contiguous surfaces of the lobes, is re- flected over their anterior margin upon their inner surface, reaches the root of the lung, and covers its anterior surface, is then reflected forwards upon the side of the pericardium, in front of which it is applied to the pleura of the opposite side, and at length arrives at the border of the sternum, from which we had supposed it to commence.* The antero-posterior septum formed by the two pleurae, between the ster- * [A fold of the pleura reaching from the lower edge of the root of the lung downwards to the diaphragm, is called the ligamentum latum pulmonis.

It foUows from this that the upper part ot the anterior mediastinum (pp,fig. 170.) is behind the sternum, whilst its lower portion is behind the left costal cartilages, and hence the interior of this mediastinum may be reached, without opening the cavity of the pleura by in- troducing an instrument close to the left border of the sternum, opposite the fifth rib. The anterior mediastinum is narrow in the middle, and expanded above and below, Uke an hour-glass. The upper cone or expansion is very much developed in the foetus, and is occupied by the thymus gland, which is afterwards replaced by cellular tissue: the lower cone or expansion is much larger, and contains the heart and pericardium, the phrenic nerves, and in front of the heart a large quantity of cellular tissue. This latter, which is so abundant in the anterior mediastinum, communicates freely above with the cellular tissue in front of the neck, and below with that of the abdominal parietes, through a triangular interval existing in the dia- phragm behind the sternum. This double communication explains how the pus of an abscess formed in the neck or in the mediastinum may reach the surface in the epigastric region. The pleura has two surfaces, one an external, the other internal. External or adherent surface. This does not adhere with equal firmness to all the parts which it covers. The pleura costalis is but slightly adherent, and may be separated from the ribs and the intercostal muscles with the greatest ease. It is sometimes raised in the situation of these muscles by subjacent adipose tissue. It is strengthened by a layer of fibrous tissue, which, notwith- standing its tenuity, performs an important part in diseases of the chest; it explains why abscesses formed in the parietes of the thorax so seldom open into the cavity of the pleura, and why effusions into the pleura are so rarely discharged externally. The diaphragmatic pleura is more adherent than the costal. We sometimes find here, especially round the pericardium, some large fatty appendages, resembling the appendices epiploicse of the great intestine. The pleura is extremely thin upon the lungs (pleura pulmonalis), where it is not strengthened by any fibrous tissue ; and although it is more adherent here than the parietal pleura, still it can be easily demonstrated. The me- diasiinalpleura is united to the parts contained within the mediastinum by very loose cellular tissue, but it adheres more firmly to the sides of the pericardium, to which the phrenic nerves are closely applied. The internal orfree surface is smooth f, moistened with serum, and in contact with itself throughout its entire extent, as is the case in all serous membranes. The adhesions so commonly met with here are altogether accidental. The structure of the pleura is cellular. J It is doutbful whether it receives any arteries and veins. The vascular network, which is sometimes so highly developed after pleurisy, does not belong to it, but is situated upon its external surface. No nerves have been traced into this membrane. Uses. Each pleura forms an investment for the corresponding lung, separates it from the parietes of the thorax and from the other viscera, and at the same time facilitates its movements upon the walls of the thoracic cavity by means of the serosity, which is constantly exhaled and absorbed at its intenial surface. * According to Meckel, the anterior mediastinum is the portion of the septum situated in front of the heart, just as the posterior mediastinum Is the part situated behind that organ. t [It Is covered with a squamous epithelium, and cilia have been observed upon it in some of the mammalia.] t [Beneath the pleura another cellular layer may be demonstrated: and m the lung of tlie seal and leopard an elastic coat is said to exist.]551 THE LUNGS. N N 4 The proper Tissue of the Lungs. The pulmonary tissue appears like a spongy or vesicular texture the cells of v hich are filled with air. This is rendered apparent by the most simple in- nection of he surface of an inflated lung, either with the naked eye or with a'len l iScroscopical examination of sections of a dried lung shows the existence of this cellular or vesicular texture in the most evident manner throughout the entire organ. The difPerent shapes of the ceUs and their un- equal size may also be distinguished. , , . But what are the relations of the cells with each other ? Do they communi- cate throughout the whole extent of the lung, or only within a determinate space, or are they independent of each other? In order to resolve these questions, it is necessary to examine the lung of a large animal, of the ox for example the sfucture of which is similar to that of the human lung, on which the same observations may be subsequently repeated. We then observe that the surface of the lung is traversed by lines, dividing it into lozenge-shaped compartments ; and if the lung be previously inflated, it will be seen that the surface is slightly depressed opposite these lines, but that it bulges out between them. If, by means of a delicate tube, air be blown under the pleura, or if the luug be forcibly inflated through the trachea, so as to rupture some of the vesicles and°produce emphysema, we then perceive that the lines bounding the-lozenge- shaped intervals correspond to thin layers of very delicate but tolerably loose cellular tissue, which divide the lung into a large number of groups or cells, which may be completely separated from each other by dissection, until at last we arrive at the pedicles by which they are united into a common mass. These groups of cells are the lohules of the lung; the cellular tissue uniting them is the interlobular cellular tissue, which is extremely delicate, never loaded with fat, but often infiltrated with serosity, and is subject to emphysema. A great number of lymphatic vessels traverse this cellular tissue : they are often visible to the naked eye, and are always easily injected; they pass deeply into the substance of the lung. The pulmonary lobules do not communicate with each other, but each is per- fectly independent of the rest. This fact is shown by inflation ; it is most dis- tinctly proved by dissection; and an examination of the lungs of the foetus will remove all doubts concerning it. The pleura and the interlobular cellular tissue having but little strength in the foetus, the lobules become separated without dissection, resemble grapes attached to their foot-stalks, and hang from a com- mon stem, formed by the divisions of the bronchi and the pulmonary vessels. This independence of the lobules is also proved by pathological anatomy : thus we continually find one lobule infiltrated with serum, with pus, or with tubercular matter, in the midst of perfectly healthy lobules. Each lobule then is a small lung, and may act independently of those by which it is surrounded. I have satisfied myself by a great number of experi- ments, that the lobules are not all equally permeable to the air, and that a moderate inflation of the lungs, made as much as possible within the limits of an ordinary inspiration, does not perhaps dilate one third of the pulmonary lobules. I have observed, and this fact appears to me of great importance, that the most permeable lobules are those of the apex of the lung; and this perhaps will explain the greater frequency of tubercles in that situation. * There are some lobules in the lung which are kept as it were in reserve, and only act in forced inspirations, f • It IS rather too much to say that pneumonia almost always attacks the base of the lungs ■ this disease has no special locality ; it perhaps as often affects the apex as the base. ' t In ordinary respiration, perhaps not more than one third of the lung is in action : exercise and yawning are probably required, from the necessity for bringing the whole lung into action I bus a great number of tubercles may exist in the lung, without manifesting their presence bv impeding ordin.iry respiration. It is in violent inspiration, in exercise, in efTorts of the voice and in all movements during which the whole of the lungs is called into play, that we dptei-f the existence of a lesion in the central organ of respiration.

' Ihe lung then is a collection of an immense number of lobules, placed alone the bronchial tubes and pulmonary vessels, which serve as a support and frame- work for them and to which they are appended by pedicles ; they are united to each other by serous cellular tissue, and are all covered by one great cell lormed by the pleura, which merely unites together this great number of parts' Ihe problem of the texture of the lungs reduces itself therefore to the determination of the structure of a single lobule ; but the difficulty is rather postponed than got rid of, for each lobule is a little lung, receiving an air-tube and an artery, and giving out several veins and lymphatics. Before describing the arrangement of the air-tube, and the vessels in each lobule, we shall say a few words upon the structure of the lobule itself Each lobule is an agglomeration of cells and of vesicles, all of which communi- cate with each other. * These cells are always full of air. Their size isnot always the same ; M. Magendie has already shown that the pulmonary cells are smaUer in the infant than in the adult, and smaller in the adult than in the aged.f Nor IS the size of the different cells in the same lobule constantly imifonn. All the cells of the same lobule communicate, but they are not all equally per- meable. * Thus, in a given degree of inspiration, some cells only are dis- tended, while others require a greater degree of dilatation. The septa between the cells of a lobule are incomplete *, and consist of filaments or lamella; and the reticulated arrangement of the cells, which is so evident to the naked eye in the lung of the frog, seems to me to represent with tolerable accuracy the ap- pearance of the human lung under the simple microscope. With regard to the structure of the cells *, we cannot admit the existence of muscular fibres round them ; the anatomist is unable to demonstrate them, and physiology rejects them. The most probable opinion is, that they are formed of dense cellular tissue, or of an elastic fibrous tissue, and that the bloodvessels are ramified upon their parietes. The Air-tubes. The air-tubes of the lungs consist of the trachea, the bronchi, and their divi- sio7is. The Trachea. The trachea (from rpoxus, rough), or aspera arteria (b,figs. 170, 171.), is the common trunk of the air-tubes of the lungs ; it is situated between the larynx (a. Jig. 171.), of which it is a continuation, and the bronchi (p p'), which are nothing more than its bifurcation in front of the vertebral column, extending from the fifth cervical to the third dorsal vertebra. | In this situation, however, it is moveable, and may easily be pushed to the right or left side. This mobility has occasioned serious accidents in tracheotomy, and has led to the invention of an instrument for fixing the trachea. § Its direction is vertical; it occupies the median line above, but appears to be slightly deflected to the right side below. I have often seen it somewhat flexuous, but these slight deviations * See note, p. .WG. t Diseases have a remarkable influence upon their size; in chronic catarrh, and in some varieties of asthma, we find the pulmonary cells excessively dilated. Laennec has called this dilatation pulmonary emphysema. t The term trachea is derived from the roughness produced by the projection of the carti- lages of the windpipe. The application of the term arteria, by the ancients, to the vessels which carry red blood, arose from a serious anatomical mistake. These vessels being ha- bitually empty in the dead body, it was supposed that they contained air during life; and hence the name artery, which they still retain. ^ By a surgeon of the name of Buchot.

The length of the trachea equals that of the space between the fifth cervical and the third dorsal vertebra, and is therefore from four to five inches ; but it varies according as the larynx is raised or depressed, and as the neck is flexed or extended. The difference produced in its length, by the utmost elongation and shortening, may be about half us entire length, i. e. from two inches to two inches and a half; its shortening is hmited by the contact of its cartilaginous rings. * • •■■ >• The diameter of the trachea is determined by that of the cricoid cartUage ot the larynx; it is much wider in the male than in the female, and after than before puberty. Individuals who have been many years labouring under chronic catarrh have the air passages remarkably large, especially the trachea. The mean diameter of the trachea is from ten to twelve lines in the male, and from nine to ten in the female. The trachea is not of equal diameter through- out ; it is almost always dilated at its lower extremity where it bifurcates. In some subjects it gradually increases in size from above downwards, and re- sembles a sort of truncated cone, with the base below. External surface, form and relations. In front and on the sides the trachea is cylindrical (^^.170.), but is flattened behind (^c?. 171.), so that it re- sembles a cylinder, the posterior fourth or third of which has been renioved. The external surface is rough, and as it were interrupted by circular ridges, which correspond to the cartilaginous rings. The relations of its external surface must be examined in the neck and in the thorax. Belations of the cervical portion {x,fig. 140.). la front the trachea is in rela- tion with the thyroid body, the isthmus of which being sometimes very narrow and sometimes very largely developed, covers a greater or less number of the rings of the trachea. In general, the first ring of the trachea is above the isthmus of the thyroid. Below the thyroid body the trachea is in relation with the sterno-thyroid muscles, the edges of which are separated only by the linea alba of the neck ; also with the cervical fascia, the thyroid plexus of veins, a considerable quantity of cellular tissue, the thyroid artery of Neubauer, when it exists, and the brachio-cephalic artery, which always passes a little above the supra-sternal notch. AU these relations are of the greatest importance in re- ference to the operation of tracheotomy. On the sides the trachea is embraced by the lateral portions of the thyroid body, and therefore, in diseases of that organ, the corresponding part of the trachea is deformed, flattened on the sides, and elliptical or even triangular. The compression of this canal may be carried so far as to produce suffocation. The common carotid artery and the pneumo- gastric nerve are in contact with it on either side ; and hence the possibility of wounding that artery in the operation of tracheotomy. A great number of lymphatic glands are situated upon the sides of the trachea, and may become so large as to prevent the passage of the air. Lastly, all the relations of the trachea, excepting those with the thyroid body, take place through the medium of a very loose cellular tissue in which this canal is embedded. Behind, the trachea is flat and membranous, and is in relation with the oeso- phagus, which projects a little beyond it on the left side, and separates it from the vertebral column. The left recurrent nerve is situated in the groove fonned between the trachea and the oesophagus in this direction ; the right recurrent nerve lies behind the trachea. The immediate relation of the trachea with the oesophagus explains why ♦ The elongation and shortening of the trachea is much more limited in man than in birds m which the rings of the trachea are moved by longitudinal muscles, and can be drawn within each other ; in the greatest possible degree of shortening three rings overlap each other so as to equal only one in height; and therefore the trachea of a bird may be diminished bv two thirds.

In the thorax, the trachea occupies the posterior mediastinum. It corresponds m front, proceeding from above downwards, with the sternum and the sterno-thyroid muscles; with the left brachio-cephalic vein (c, fig. 170.); with the brachio-cephalic artery (A), an aneurism of which may open into the trachea: its left side is as it were embraced between the braehio-cephaUc artery (/i), and the left common ca- rotid 0); ■with the back part of the arch of the aorta {g), which rests imme- diately upon it, and hence the dyspnoea which so generally accompanies aneu- rism of the aorta, and the frequency of its bursting into the windpipe; and lastly, lower down, with the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, which corre- sponds with that of the trachea. The trachea is in relation behind with the oesophagus, which separates it from the spinal column; and on the sides with those portions of the pleuras which form the mediastinum, with the pneumogastric nerves, and with the upper part of the recurrent nerves. In aU its thoracic portion the trachea is surrounded by numerous lymphatic vessels and glands, and by a loose and very abundant cellulai- tissue, which communicates with that of the cervical region. These lymphatic vessels and glands with the loose cellular tissue are the parts immediately adjoining the trachea; and it may readily be conceived that enlargement of the glands may be productive of serious consequences. Internal surface. The internal surface of the trachea is of a rosy colour, and presents the same circular ridges as the external surface, but they are more distinct. It is also remarkable in its membranous portion for the pro- jection of certain vertical fasciculi, to which we shall again refer when speak- ing of the structure of these parts. The Bronchi. The bronchi {^p6yxos, guttur, p, p, fig. 171.) are the two branches formed by the bifurcation of the trachea, which spread out from each other at a right or a slightly obtuse angle; one (p) is intended for the right, the other for the left (p') lung. A tolerably strong triangular ligament exists at the angle of the bifurcation, and seems intended to prevent too great separation of the bronchi. The bronchi differ/rom each other in many respects ; first, in width. The right bronchus is much wider than the left, and its diameter is not much less than that of the trachea. In a female, whose trachea was ten lines in diameter, the right bronchus was eight, and the left five. This difference in width corresponds with the difference in the size of the two lungs, and may afford a tolerably correct measure of that size: they differ also in length, the right bronchus being one inch in length, the left two: also in direction, the right bronchus passing less obliquely than the left, probably because it enters the corresponding lung sooner than the latter; and lastly, in their relations. Thus, the right bronchus is embraced by the vena azygos, whicli forms a loop immediately above it, in order to terminate in the vena cava superior. The left bronchus is embraced above by the arch of the aorta (g^)," and has an important relation with the oesophagus behind, which it crosses obliquely. Both are connected with the pulmonary plexus of nerves; bothTHE LUNGS. 555 are surrounded with lymphatic glands, remarkable for their black colour, and for being frequently tod, and which in some f^^^P,;\-£ furcation of the trachea; and lastly, both have the fol- lowing relations with the pulmonary artery and veins. Each pulmonary artery {kk') is si- tuated in front of the corresponding bronchus, then passes above, and finally behind it. The two pulmonary veins on each side Q I, m m) are situ- ated upon the same vertical plane as the corresponding artery; they pass upwards in front of the artery and the bronchus, which is, therefore, be- I hind the blood vessels. * The shape of the bronchi exactly resembles that of the trachea, i. e. they represent cylinders, the posterior fourth of which has been removed, and which are formed by parallel rings. The area of the two bronchi is greater than that of the trachea, in the same way as the area of the bronchial ramifications is greater than that of the bronchi themselves, so that the velocity of the expired air increases as it approaches the exterior. At the root of the lungs the bronchi divide into two equal branches, but in a somewhat different manner. The upper branch of the bifurcation of the right bronchus is the smaller, and is intended for the upper lobe of the lung, in order to reach which it is bent slightly upwards. The lower branch, which is larger, follows the original direction, and, after passing about an inch, divides into two unequal branches, a smaU one for the middle lobe, and a larger one for the lower lobe. I have once seen a small bronchus proceeding from the lower part of the trachea directly to the apex of the right lung; the vena azygos passed between it and the regular bronchus, f The secondary divisions are precisely the same in the two lungs; each branch of a bifurcation becomes bifurcated in its turn. All these ramifications pursue a diverging course, some ascending, others descending, and after pro- ceeding for a variable distance, they again bifurcate ; so that by separating a small portion of the pulmonary substance, we can see that several diverging series of tubes proceed in succession from a bronchial trunk, and pass outwards into the tissue of the lung. The prevailing mode of division of the air-tubes in the lungs is that called dichotomous, viz. a division into two equal branches, which we shall afterwards find to be the most favourable to the rapid trans- * [In consequence of the oblique direction of the left bronchus towards the root of the lung, the corresponding pulmonary artery is placed somewhat above it, and the pulmonary veins Iwlow it; on the right side, the pulmonary artery is in the middle, the bronchus above, and the veins below.] t This appears to be the natural arrangement in the sheep and the ox.SPLANCHNOLOGY. 556 that of the bronchi themselves and of the trachea. They represent, indeed a complete cyhnder, which is not truncated behind; and the cartilages, instead'of forming rings, have another arrangement, which I shall point out when speaking 01 their structure. ° Relations. The first divisions of the bronchi are surrounded even in the substance of the lung by very numerous and dark coloured bronchial Ivmphatic glands, enlargement of which is a very frequent result of chronic bronchitis and may cause suffocation. The bronchial ramifications, as I have said, support the pulmonary lobules which are applied to and moulded upon them, and are united to them by very loose cellular tissue. The following are their relations with the branches of the pulmonary artei7 and veins : — the artery always accompanies the bronchial ramification, and is situated behind it; the vein is often separated from it; the artery and vein are not unfrequently found interlaced around the corresponding bronchial tube. Relations of the bronchial ramifications with the pulmonary lobules. Each pul- monary lobule has its bronchial tube. This tube is cylindrical, of uniform diameter throughout, and entirely membranous; having entered the lobule, it dilates into a small ampulla, and disappears. There can be little doubt that these small ampullae have deceived Malpighi, Reisseisen, and others, who have stated that the bronchial tubes terminate in culs-de-sac ; so that, according to these authors, each pulmonary cell is the termination of a particular bronchial tube. But it is evident that such cannot be the case, for, on the one hand, the bronchial tubes are not sufficiently numerous, and on the other it can be shown that only a single bronchial tube enters into each group of cells or each lobule. If we inject with tallow a lung, which has previously been deprived of air, either by an effusion in the chest during life, or by an artificial one after death, it will be seen that the injection is divided into small globules or rounded tubercles, which correspond to so many pulmonary cells, and that these glo- bules are all connected with a common pedicle, corresponding to the bronchial tube. Reisseisen who has made this injection, thinks that the granular appearance of the injected matter represents the culs-de-sac, into which it had penetrated.* * [.\ccording to Reisseisen, each small bronchial tube, on entering its corresponding lobule, f divides and subdivides in a cer- tain uniform order into nume- rous twigs (I, Jig.\72.), which, extending towards the surface of the lobule, gradually decrease in diameter, but increase in num- ber, and at length terminate in clusters of short free closed and rounded extremities (cc); these are the pulmonary cells, which vary from ,'5th to j^jth of an This view of the minute struc- ture of the lung, which is opposed inch in diameter. Not only are the several lobules independent of each other, hut the cells of each lobule have no communi- cation with one another except indirectly through the twig or twigs from which they proceed.

Two rings are often united for a certain extent, and sometimes a ring is found bifiircated; in- deed it is probable that differences in the number of the rmgs depend upon their thus uniting or dividing. They are sufficiently thin to allow of being compressed, so that the opposite surfaces may touch without breaking. Iheir elasticity enables them to recover their original position immediately, and thus permit free access to the air. They can only be broken when ossified, which is frequently the case in the aged. . n^x. c ^ The first ring and the two lower rings present some peculiarities. _ i he farst is broader than any of the others, especiaUy in the middle line, and it is often continuous with the cricoid cartilage.* _ The last ring of the trachea, which forms the transition between it and the bronchi, has the following characters : —the middle part is prolonged consider- ably downwards, and curved backwards, forming a very acute angle, and is developed into a spur-shaped projection within the trachea, which separates the two bronchi. The two half rings resulting from this arrangement consti- tute the two first rings of the bronchi. The last ring but one of the trachea presents an angular inflection in the middle, less marked, however, than that observed in the lowest ring. The fibrous tissue of the trachea. This is arranged in the following manner:— a fibrous cylinder commences at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage; the cartilaginous rings are situated within the substance of this cylinder in such a manner, that the thicker layer of fibrous tissue lies on their exterior, so that at first sight their internal surfaces would appear to be in immediate contact with the mucous membrane. In the posterior part of the trachea, where the cartilaginous rings are wanting, the fibrous tissue alone forms its basis or framework. The muscular fibres of the trachea. If we carefully remove the fibrous tissue from the back of the trachea, opposite its membranous portion, we arrive at to the opinion of M. Cruveilhier, receives support from what is known concerning the develope- ment of the lungs, and from the analogy between these organs and the compound glands. In^. 172., after Reisseisen, o shows the natural size of the portion represented magnified about nine diameters in b. The bronchial twigs and pulmonary cells are seen distended with air; the knots or projections (d) on the sides of some of the twigs, indicate the commencement of other twigs into which no air has passed.] * I have met with one case in which the thin upper rings of the trachea and the cricoid car- tilage were joined together, but only on one side; the crico-thyroid muscle and the inferior constrictor of the pharynx evidently arose from the first ring of the trachea. This continuity of the cricoid cartilage with the trachea, manifestly proves that the rings of the latter are car- tilages, and not fibro-cartilages.SPLANCHNOLOGY. certain transverse muscular fibres, extending from one end of each rinir to the other, and also occupying the intervals between the rings. The existence 01 these muscular fibres, which I have seen forming a laye? half a Swck m certain cases of chronic catarrh, cannot be doubted. It is evident that their ZZ Z r *'l^^r^^-.-^l^ °f the rings towards each other, and tEte narrow the trachea, the aimmution in the width of which is limited bv the contact of the ends of the rings. ^^^uueu uy me The longitudinal yellow fasciculi. In the membranous portion of the trachea between the muscular and the mucous layer, are situated a great number of £ t yellow fasciculi, which at first sight resemble longitudinal tolds, but are not at all effaced by distension ; these fasciculi adhere to and produce an elevation of the mucous membrane, and opposite the bifurcation of the trachea they also divide, and are continued into the bronchi The nature of this tissue is not weU known ; it can only belong to the mus- cular or to the yeUow elastic tissue, though I would rather incline to the latter opinion. According to either supposition, its use is to prevent too great an elongation of the trachea and the bronchi; actively in the one casef and bv virtue of Its elasticity in the other. Not unfrequently some longitudinal fasci- culi are found behind the cartilaginous rings. The tracheal glands. If we carefuUy examine the posterior surface of the tracbea, we find a certain number of ovoid flattened glands (see Jig 171) placed upon the outer surface of the fibrous membrane ; and by removing this membrane we see a tolerably thick but not continuous layer of similar glands between the fibrous and the muscular coats ; and moreover, if either the inner or the outer layer of the fibrous tissue, situated between the cartilaginous rings, be removed, a series of much smaller glands wiU be found between these layers, occupying the intervals between the rings, and even extending behind them. The mucous membrane. This is a continuation of the mucous membrane of the larynx ; it is remarkable for its tenuity, which permits the colour of the subjacent parts to be seen through it, and for its intimate adhesion to the structures covered by it. The longitudinal folds of which some authors speak, do not exist; the yellow longitudinal fasciculi have been mistaken for them. Lastly, it presents a great number of openings, from which mucus can be ex- pressed. These openings are nothing more than the orifices of the excretory ducts of the tracheal glands.* The vessels and nerves. The arteries of the trachea are derived from the superior and inferior thyroid. The veins are generally arranged thus: some venous trunks running along the inner surface of the trachea beneath the mucous membrane, receive on each side, in the same manner as the vena azygos, small veins corresponding to the intervals between the cartilaginous rings, and then terminate in the neighbouring veins. The lymphatic vessels are very numerous ; they enter the surrounding glands, which are of considerable size. The nerves are derived from the pneumogastrics. Structure of the Bronchi. The structure of the bronchi is exactly the same as that of the trachea. The left bronchus has ten or twelve cartilaginous rings ; the right has five or six. They both possess transverse muscular fibres, longitudinal yellow fasci- culi, glands, &c. Their arteries generally arise directly from the aorta, and * SIructure of the trachea. [The muscular fibres of the trachea are of the involuntary class (see p. 426.), and are attached to the internal surface of the ends of the rings: the longitu- dinal fibres exist all round the trachea, but are collected into bundles on its membranous portion only; they are believed to consist of elastic tissue. The glands of the trachea and bronchi are compound ; its mucous membrane is covered with a columnar epithelium, and is-provided with cilia, which urge the secretions upwards towards tiie larynx.]559 THE LUNGS. named bronchial. The veins of the right bronchus enter the vena azygos ; oblong, curved, terminated by very elongated angles, and so arranged that they can overlap and be mutually received between each other. They are also united together by fibrous tissue. This arrangement of curved and angular seg- ments exists as far as the last bifurcations of the bronchial tubes ; but the size of the segments gradually diminishes, so that they soon form only narrow bnes, and ultimately mere cartilaginous points. The fibrous and membranous con- stituents of the cylinder preponderate more and more over the cartilaginous laminffi, which disappear beyond the ultimate bifurcations of the bronchial tubes, being found last at the several angles of bifurcation : the ultimate bron- chial ramifications are altogether membranous. The mucous membrane is prolonged to the very last ramifications, -where it becomes extremely thin. The longitudinal elastic fasciculi, which were limited to the membranous portion of the bronchi, are expanded over the entire surface of the bronchial tubes beyond their first subdivision. The muscxdar fibres, which are confined to the membranous portion in the trachea and bronchi, be- come circular on the inner side of the bronchial ramifications, and form an uninterrupted but very thin layer, precisely resembling the circular fibres of the intestinal canal.* When we consider, on the one hand, the arrangement of the cartilaginous segments, which appear as it were shaped expressly for the purpose of fitting between each other at their extremities, and of constituting an apparatus capable of being moved, and on the other the existence of circular contractile fibres on the inner surface of these segments, we cannot doubt that they are moved upon each other, the extent of such motion being measured by the space they have to traverse in order to come into contact. When this is effected, the canals must be almost completely obliterated.! Besides the trachea, the bronchi and the bronchial ramifications, which may be regarded as forming the framework of the lungs, these organs receive two sets of arteries, viz. the pulmonary and the bronchial; and give out two sets of veins, also called pulmonary and bronchial. A very great number of lymphatics arise from their interior, and from their surfaces, and they are penetrated by important nerves. The size of the pulmonary artery is equal to, if not greater than, that of the aorta; the bronchial arteries appear to be distributed upon the bronchi and their ramifications, which they exactly follow. The pulmonary veins correspond with the pulmonary artery : they are two in number for each lung. The bronchial veins correspond with the bronchial arteries, and terminate in the vena azygos on the right side, and in the su- perior intercostal vein on the left. * Structure of the bronchi and their branches. [According to Reisseisen, the fibrous cylinder gradually degenerates in the smallest bronchial tubes into cellular tissue ; according to the same author, the longitudinal elastic and the circular fibres can be traced as far as the tubes can be opened. The contractility of the pulmonary tissue on the application of galvanism, recently observed by Dr. C. J.B. Williams, establishes the muscularity of the circular fibres of the bronchial tubes. The mucous membrane, ns in the trachea, has a columnar and ciliated epithelium ; it of course enters into and lines the pulmonary cells ] t These anatomical facts explain, in a remarkabio manner, all the phenomena of nervous asthma, nervous suffocation, &c. The Pulmonary Vessels and Nerves.SPLANCHNOLOGY. Within the lung, as well as at its root, the pulmonary arteries and veins always accompany the bronchial tubes. The three vessels may be distin- guished from each other upon sections of the organ by the following cha- racters:—the ar<«-^ remains open, or rather so, and is of a white colour; thQ bronchus is also open, but of a more or less rosy colour, and contains a irothy mucus, which may be pressed out of it; the vein is collapsed, and much more difficult to be seen than the artery. The relations of these three kinds of vessels have not appeared to me to be constant. Notwithstanding the investigations of Haller, the arrangement of the bronchial with regard to the pulmonary arteries and veins is not well known.* I ought to notice the easy communication between the arteries and the pul- monary veins and bronchial ramifications. The coarsest injection pushed with moderate force passes with the greatest facility from the arteries into the pulmonary veins and the bronchial tubes f ; only inflamed portions of the lung have appeared to me to be impermeable. The hjmphatic vessels, both superficial and deep, are very numerous; they terminate in the bronchial and tracheal glands, the number and size of which sufficiently declare their importance. The black colour of these glands only begins to appear from the tenth to the twentieth year. The nerves of the lungs are principally derived from the pneumogastrics, but they receive some branches from the ganglionic system. They form a large plexus behind the bronchi, with the divisions of which they penetrate into the substance of the lung. I should observe that there is only one great pulmonary plexus common to the two lungs; and on this circumstance, the sympathy between the two is without doubt partially dependent. Developement. According to Meckel, the lungs are among the latest organs to appear in the foetus ; they can only be distinctly recognised amidst the other contents of the thorax, towards the end of the second month of intra- uterine existence. J The lung is smallest at the earliest period of its developement. Its place appears then to be occupied by the thymus, which is the only organ that is seen when the thorax is opened, the lungs being situated behind it, upon each side of the vertebral column. The developement of the lung takes place in an inverse ratio to that of the thymus; the lung increasing in proportion as * [The following are the results of Reisseisen's observations on this subject. The branches of the pulmonary artery accompany the bronchial tubes, and do not anastomose until their ter- mination in a dense network of capillaries upon the walls of the air cells: these capillaries have very thin coats ; they are about one twentieth the diameter of a pulmonary cell, and the meshes which they form are scarcely so wide as the vessels themselves. From this network arise the branches of the pulvionary veins, which unite into larger and larger trunks, so as to correspond with the divisions of the pulmonary artery; these veins have no valves, and their caliber is not greater, perhaps less, than that of the artery. Such is the chief mode of distribution of the pulmonary artery and veins; but both vessels, as indicated below, also communicate with the bronchial arteries. The bronchial arteries are the nutrient vessels of the lung ; some of their branches are dis- tributed upon the air tubes and to their lining membrane, even as far as the air cells, upon all the pulmonary vessels and nerves, and to the bronchial lymphatic glands; whilst others, passing between the lobules, or upon the surface of the lung, anastomose with twigs from the pul- monary artery, and form, with the branches of the pulmonary vein, a vascular network in those situations, but more particularly beneath the pleura. The branches distributed to the larger bronchia and vessels, and to the lymphatic glands, and also some of the vessels composing the superficial network, terminate in the bronchial veins, which, however, cannot be traced very deeply into the substance of the lung. But by far the greater number of the bronchial arteries end in the pulmonary veins; for example, those distributed deeply to the smaller air tubes and pulmonary vessels, and to the air cells, and nearly all the vessels which enter into the for- mation of the interlobular and superficial network.] t [This is due to rupture of the pulmonary vessels, which have exceedingly delicate coats, and are perhaps less supported by surrounding tissue than the vessels of other organs.] % [The developement of the lungs has been traced by various recent observers in frogs, birds, and mammalia, including man; according to Rathke and Miiller, it closely resembles, in its early stages, that of the compound glands. In mammalia, the lungs appear at first as a pro- tuberance upon the anterior part of the cesophagus, consisting of a soft mass, like the primitive blastema of a gland: within this substance a more opaque portion is formed, from which while lines extend, dividing and subdividing, and terminating in enlarged extremities; these are ac- companied by bloodvessels, and are at first solid, but soon become hollowed out, into the trachea, bronchi, bronchial tubes, and air cells.]THE LARYNX. 561 the thymus diminishes. In the last two months of pregnancy the lung is completely developed, and fit for performing respiration. The weight of the lung in the foetus and in the adult presents some differ- ences, -which are well worthy of attention. During the whole period of intra- uterine life, the foetal lung is specifically heavier than water; but as soon as the infant respires, it becomes much lighter, and floats in water. Yet the absolute weight of the lung is sensibly increased; because it receives a much greater quantity of blood than it did previously. Before birth, the absolute weight of the lung to that of the whole body is as 1 to 60 ; after biith, it is as I to 30. It follows, therefore, that lungs which float in water, and which have acquired a much greater absolute weight than they would have had in the foetus, must belong to an infant that has re- spired. After birth the lung participates in the developement of the rest of the body. At the time of puberty it acquires the proportions which it subse- quently presents. I have not observed that the lungs are smaller and lighter in the aged than in the adult. The colour of the lungs varies considerably at difierent periods. In the earlier periods of developement, the lung of the foetus is of a delicate pink colour ; subsequently it becomes of a deep red, like lees of wine, and remains so until the time of birth. After birth, it again becomes of a pink colour. StiU later, from the tenth to the twentieth year, black spots become visible at different points along the lines which form the lozenge-shaped intervals on its surface. These spots subsequently unite into lines or patches, which give to the greyish surface of the organ a mottled appearance. The developement of the black matter is so clearly the effect of age, that it is very rare not to find small masses of it in the apex or some other part of the lungs in the old subject. It is worthy of notice, that the black matter appears simultaneously on the surface of the lung, and in the lymphatic glands situated at its root, and along the bronchi. With regard to structure, it may be observed, that during the four or five earlier months of gestation, the pulmonary lobules are perfectly distinct from each other ; they may be separated by very gentle traction, on account of the weakness of the pleura and cellular tissue which unites them, as compared with the pulmonary tissue itself. The cartilaginous rings begin to be visible after the third month. Functions. The lungs are the essential organs of respiration ; that process by means of which the blood, though dark and unfit for supporting life be- fore entering these organs, becomes red and vivifying. For the accomplish- ment of this function, the lungs receive, on the one hand, the atmospheric air, and on the other, the venous blood, the whole of which, in the human subject, passes through the lungs. The air is not drawn in by any power resident in the pulmonary tissue itself, but by the muscular action of the parietes of the thorax; the blood is propeUed into it by the right ventricle of the heart. While the blood undergoes the changes above mentioned, the atmospheric air loses a portion of its oxygen, which is replaced by carbonic acid gas. The manner in which these changes in the blood are eff'ected is not yet well known. The Larynx.* It is necessary to have several specimens, from subjects of different ages and sexes, so as to be able to. examine the general relations of the larynx in its J.lTrZffS ^•''""gs essentially to the functions of relation, and therefore Bichat describes iu TufZl^w J^ apparatus of locomotion ; but the anatomical connectionsbetwVen tL lamfx and the respiratory organs are such that a animals provided with lunes have a larunv oi// i3w the larynx disappears where the lungs cease to exist ^ VOL.

The larynx is a sort of box (jyixis cava) or cartilaginous passage, consisting of several moveable pieces, which forma complex apparatus intended for the organ of the voice. It is situated {v, fig. 140.) in the median line, in the course of the air passages, opening into the pharynx (3) above, and being continuous -with the trachea (x) below : it occupies the anterior and upper part of the neck, below the OS hyoides, the movements of which it follows, and in front of the vertebral column, being separated from it by the pharynx : it is covered by the muscles of the sub-hyoid region which intervene between it and the skin ; and it is therefore very liable to wounds, and may easily be reached by the surgeon. Its mobility allows of its being raised, depressed, and carried forwards or back- wards ; all of which movements are concerned both in deglutition and in the production of different tones of the voice. It may also be carried to the right or left side ; but these lateral displacements are most commonly produced by external violence, or by the growth of timiours. Dimensions. The larynx appears like an expansion of the trachea, and has therefore been denominated its head, caput aspera artericB. The exact deter- mination of its dimensions, according to age and sex, or in different individuals, and their relations to the various qualities of the voice, would be extremely interesting in a physiological point of view. Its greater size in the male than in the female, and the developement it undergoes in both sexes, but especially in the male, at the period of puberty, are among the most remarkable phe- nomena in the hiunan economy. Form. It is cylindrical below, like the trachea, but is expanded above, and becomes prismatic and triangular. It may therefore be compared to a three- sided pyramid, the truncated apex of which is directed downwards, and the base upwards ; it is perfectly symmetrical. As the larynx is a very complicated organ, I shaU describe in succession the numerous parts which enter into its composition. Being intended to admit of the continual passage of the air in the act of respiration, it must therefore pre- sent a constantly pervious cavity, having strong and elastic walls ; but as it is also the organ of the voice, it requires to be provided with a moveable apparatus, subject to the will. We accordingly find in it a cartilaginous skeleton or framework, much stronger than that of the trachea; certain articulations and ligaments, and a vocal apparatus composed of four fibrous bands, or vocal cords ; muscles, which move the different pieces of the cartilaginous skeleton, and produce certain changes in the vocal apparatus indispensable for the production of sounds ; a mucous membrane, lining its inner surface ; glands, which pour out their fluid upon that surface ; and, lastly, certain vessels and nerves. We cannot enter upon a general description of the organ, imtil we have studied separately its constituent parts. The cartilages of the larynx. These are five in number ; of which three are median, single, and symmetrical, viz. the cricoid, the thyroid, and the epiglottis, and two are lateral, viz. the arytenoid, of which the cornicula laryngis are merely appendages. The cartilaginous nodules, described by some authors under the name of the cuneiform cartilages, and situated in the membranous fold extending from the arytenoid cartilages to the epiglottis, do not exist in the human sub- The cricoid cartilage. The cricoid or annular cartilage (c c', ^^^s. 173 to 177.) forms the base of the larynx ; it is much thicker and stronger than any of the others. Its form is that of a ring, whence its name (kpIkos, a ring); it is narrow in front (c, fig. 173.), where it resembles a ring of the trachea; it is three or four times broader or deeper behind (c' and c,fig. 175.), where it fonns by itself alone the greater part of the larynx, being there about an inch in height. Jn front, its external surface is subcutaneous in the median line; on each side, it gives attachment to the crico-thyroid muscle, and presents a smooth process (»n.THE LARYNX. 563 O O 2 Pig. m Jig. 177.) for articulating with the thyroid cartilage. Behind, where it is covered by the mucous membrane of the pharynx, it presents in the median line a vertical projection, which gives attachment to some of the longitudinal fibres of the oesophagus, and on each side, a depression for the pos- terior crico-arytenoid muscle. Its internal surface is covered by the laryngeal mu- cous membrane. Its lower border is perfectly circular, and slightly waved, and is connected by a membrane with the first ring of the trachea ; sometimes it is even united with it, and can only be distinguished by its greater thickness. Its upper border is not exactly circular, but is oblong from before backwards, as if the ring had been flat- tened laterally. It is cut very obliquely forwards and downwards, or rather it is deeply notched in front, where it is concave, and gives attachment to the crico-thyroid membrane in the median line, and laterally by its inner lip to a fibrous membrane, which is continuous with the inferior vocal cord, and in the rest of its thickness with the lateral crico-arytenoid muscle. Behind, and on each side, is an oblong articular facette, the arytenoid faceties (hh,fig. 173.), which are directed outwards and upwards, and articulate with the arytenoid cartilages. Between these two facettes, the upper border of the cricoid is horizontal, and very slightly notched, and gives attachment to the arytenoid muscle. The upper border of the cricoid cartilage is, therefore, horizontal behind, oblique at the sides, and horizontal and slightly concave in front. The arytenoid facettes are situated upon the oblique portion. The thyroid cartilage. The thyroid or scutiform cartilage (t,figs. 173 to 177.), so named because it has been compared to a shield {pvpe6s, a shield) *, occupies the upper and fore part of the larynx. It is formed by two quadrilateral plates (or alee), united at an acute angle in the median line, and embracing the cri- coid cartilage behind. Its anterior or cutaneous surface presents in tlie median line an angular projection (below e,fig. 173.), more marked and deeply notched above, and completely effaced below; much less distinct in the female, in whom it forms only a rounded surface, than in the male, in whom it has received the special appellation of the pomum Adami. This angular projec- tion does not appear until puberty ; it presents certain individual varieties, but these do not appear to me to have any relation with the qualities of the voice. On each side, the surface {t,figs. 173, 174.) is smooth and quadrilateral, and has two tubercles behind; one of which is superior (6), and the other inferior (d). The latter, or larger, is prolonged upon the inferior border of the cartilage. The two tubercles are united by an aponeurotic arch, but there is no oblique intermediate line, as has been generally afiirmed. These tubercles, and the imaginary line between them, separate the anterior three fourths of the surface, which are covered by the thyro-hyoid muscle, from the posterior fourth, which is covered by the inferior constrictor of the pharynx and the sterno-thyroid muscle. The tubercles give attachment to these three muscles. The posterior surface (fig. 175.) presents, in the median line, a retreating angle, which gives attachment to the thyro-arytenoid ligaments, or vocal cords, and to the thyro-arytenoid muscles. This angle is sometimes so acute, that the cartilage has the appearance of having been subjected to strong lateral pres- sure. On each side (t t), the posterior surface projects beyond the cricoid cartilage and forms part of the lateral groove of the larynx. It is lined by the pharyn- * The name may also hnve been derived from its use.564 SPLANCHNOLOGY. geal mucous membrane, and corresponds in part to the thyro- and crico-ary- tenoid muscles. Its upper border is horizontal and sinuous, and gives attachment to the hyo- thyroid membrane in its whole extent. It presents a notch {e,fig. 173.) in the median line ; which is shallower, but broader and more rounded, in the female than in the male. On the sides there is a small prominence, which forms a continuation of the superior tubercle, and is often wanting. More posteriorly we find on each side a slight notch, bounded by certain processes, called the great or superior cornua (s,Jig. 173, 174.) of the thyroid cartilage. The lower border is sinuous, and shorter than the upper, and hence the py- ramidal shape of the larynx. It presents a slight median projection, to wHch the crioo-thyroid ligament is attached; in the rest of its extent, it gives in- sertion to the crico-thyroid muscle, and presents a rough eminence, which forms a continuation of the inferior tubercle ; and more posteriorly, on each side, a slight notch, bounded by the lesser or inferior cornua (I, fig. 173. 175.) of the thyroid cartilage. Its posterior borders (s r, fig. 174.) are slightly sinuous, give attachment to the stylo-pharyngei and palato-pharyngei, and rest upon the vertebral column. As the thyroid cartilage projects behind the upper portion of the larynx, it may be regarded as protecting the larynx by its posterior borders resting upon the vertebral column. The cornua of the thyroid cartilage are four in number, two superior and two infer ior, and appear to be prolongations of the posterior borders of the cartilage. They are all rounded, and are bent inwards and backwards ; the upper or great cornua (s) are generally the larger, and are united by ligaments to the os hyoides'; the lower or lesser cornua (/) are usually smaller, and articulate with the cricoid cartilage. The arytenoid cartilages. The arytenoid cartilages (a, figs. 173.175 to 177.) are two in number*, are situated at the upper and back part of the larynx, and have a pyramidal and triangular form ; they are directed vertically, and bent backwards like the lip of an ewer, whence their name (apuTaim, a funnel). Their posterior surface ( fig. 175.) is triangular, broad, and concave, and receives the arytenoid muscle ; their internal surface is lined by the mucous membrane of the larynx; their anterior surface (fig. 173.) is convex, narrow, rough, and furrowed, and corresponds to the series of glands called the arytenoid glands, and to the superior vocal cord; their base is very deeply notched, articulates with the cricoid cartilage, and is terminated by two processes ; one posterior and external (/), which gives attachment to the lateral and posterior crico-arytenoid muscles; the other is anterior (a), pyramidal, and more or less elongated, has the inferior vocal cord attached to its point, and it forms a fourth, or almost a third, of the antero-posterior diameter of the alottis ; their apex is surmounted, or rather formed, by two very small and delicate cartilaginous nodules (</), which are bent inwards and backwards, and incurvated, so that they almost touch —they are called the conncula Thev were very correctly described by Santorini, under the name of the sixth and seventh cartilages of the larynx.

It must he separated from the neighbouring parts to he properly studied. . , , ^ . t. It varies much in size in different subjects, but always appears to me to hear some relation to the dimensions of the upper orifice of the larynx, heyond which it almost always projects when depressed. _ Its anterior or lingual surf ace presents a free and an adherent portion. The free portion surmounts the base of the tongue; it may he felt by the finger, and even seen by strongly depressing the tongue.* Three folds of mucous mem- brane, one in the middle and one on each side, pass from the epiglottis to the base of the tongue. The adherent portion corresponds in front with the hase of the tongue, the OS hyoides, and the thyroid cartilage. In order to expose it, it is necessary to have recourse to dissection. We then find a median glosso-epiglottid ligament, which is very strong, and composed of yellow elastic tissue, and which, I believe, assists in drawing back the depx'essed epiglottis: its place is occupied by muscular fibres in the larger animals ; also a hyo-epiglottid ligament, extending from the epiglottis to the posterior surface of the os hyoides; and lastly, beneath this ligament, a yellow fatty tissue, improperly called the epiglottid gland, occupying the interval between the epiglottis and the concavity of the thyroid cartilage. Moreover, the anterior surface of the epiglottis, examined in the vertical direction, is concave above, convex in the middle, and again concave below; it is convex in the transverse dii'ection. The posterior or laryngeal surface {figs. 175. 178.), the curvatures of which are the reverse of those on the anterior surface, is free in the whole of its extent, and covered by the laryngeal mucous membrane. Circumference. Its upper margin, or the base of the triangle which it re- presents, is free, bent forwards, slightly notched, and continuous, by two rounded angles, with its lateral margins, from each of which proceed two folds, viz. the aryteno-epiglottid (b, fig. 178.), extending from the epiglottis to the arytenoid cartilage, and inclosing a ligament (6, j?^. 176.), and the pharyngeo- epiglottid, situated anterior to the preceding, passing almost transversely out- wards, and lost upon the sides of the pharynx. The epiglottis tenninates below in a sort of pedicle, which is extremely slender, and is fixed (fig. 176.) into the retreating angle of the thyroid cartilage, immediately above the attachment of the vocal cords. This attachment is effected by means of a ligament, called the thyro-epiglottid. The epiglottis is remarkable for the great number of perforations found in it, which give it an appearance very much resembling that of the leaves of several of the lauracea. In these foramina we find small glands, which for the most part open on the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis. The so-called epiglottid gland has no relation with these orifices. It is also remarkable for its flexibility and elasticity; on account of which it is classed by Bichat among the fibro-cartilages, a sort of tissue which we have stated does not exist. Its yellow colour gives it an appearance like the yellow elastic tissue. It is brittle, and may be crushed between the fingers; this de- pends partly upon the nature of its tissue, and partly upon the numerous for- amina with which it is perforated, and which necessarily diminish its strength. The Articulations and Ligaments of the Larynx. The articulations of the larynx may be divided into the extrinsic and the intnnsic. » I attach great importance to inspection of the epiglottis in diseases of the larynx O o 3SPLANCHNOLOGY. The extrinsic articulations. The thjro-hjoid articulation consists of three lP™t° 'jT unite the thyroid cartilage to the os hyoides. The middle tlnjro-hijoid ligament (n, fig. 174.) is a loose yellowish membrane, extending from the upper border of the thyroid cartilage (<) to the os hyoides (a). Its vertical dimensions are much greater at the sides than in the middle; and therefore the cornua of the OS hyoides can be raised higher than its body, and hence the sides of the tongue can be elevated so as to form a groove, along which the food glides. This membrane is thick in the middle, and thin and as it were cellular on each side. Relations. It is subcutaneous in the middle, but is co- vered on each side by the thyro-hyoid muscle. It corre- sponds behind with the epiglottis, from which it is se- parated by some adipose tissue, and with the mucous membrane covering the posterior surface of the tongue. It is attached to the posterior lip of the upper edge of the OS hyoides, not to the lower edge, as is frequently asserted. It therefore passes behind the os hyoides. The lateral thyro-hijoid ligaments (o) may be considered as the margins of the thyro-hyoid membrane. They are small cords, extending from the great cornua of the thyroid cartilage to the tubercular extremities of the gi-eat cornua of the OS hyoides. We often find a cartilaginous or bony nodule in these liga- ments. There is a very distinct synovial capsule between the posterior surface of the body of the os hyoides and the upper part of the thyroid cartilage. Its pre- sence attests the frequent movements which take place between these parts, and during which the middle and upper part of the cartilage is placed behind the OS hyoides. The tracheo-cricoid articulation. The first ring of the trachea is connected with the lower border of the cricoid cartilage by a fibrous membrane of the same nature as that between the rings of the trachea. A small vertical fibrous cord is added to it in the median line in front. This membrane permits some movements between the cricoid cartilage and the first ring of the trachea, and in these the sides of the ring are buried behind the cricoid cartilage. The intrinsic articulations are the crico-thyroid and the crico-arytenoid. I need merely remind the reader of the articulation between the arytenoid cartilages and the comicula laryngis. The crico-thyroid articulations. These are arthrodial. Each of the lesser cornua of the thyroid cartilage terminate in a plane surface, directed down- wards and inwards, which rests upon a similar plane surface (rn, fig. 177.) on the cricoid cartilage, directed upwards and outwards. An orbicular or capsular ligament (r,figs. 174, 175.), composed of shining, fasciculated, and parallel fibres, surrounds the articulation, which is provided with a synovial membrane. The posterior fasciculus is remarkable for its length and shape, and extends nearly to the crico-arytenoid articulation. In some subjects the orbicular ligament is very loose, in others the articulation is exceedingly close. The movements are limited to simple gliding, combined with a forward and backward movement of the thyroid cartilage. The direction of the facettes upon the cricoid cartilage renders them fitted to support the thyroid. The crico-thyroid membrane, or middle crico-thyroid ligament. Besides the pre- ceding articulations, the lower border of the thyroid cartilage is connected with the upper border of the cricoid by a thick triangular membrane, the pyramidal or conoid ligament (v,fig. 174.); which is attached in the median line to the lower border of the thyroid cartilage, and the base of which is fixed to the upper border of the cricoid cartilage. This membrane is fibrous, thick, very strong, perforated with foramina for vessels, and is yellow and elastic. The lateral crico-thyroid ligament. This ligament ((/, fig. 176.) can be wellTHE LARYNX. 567 o o 4 seen only from the inner surface of the larynx.

Means of union. Properly speaking, there is only one ligament, the internal and posterior ie,fig. 175.). It arises from the cricoid cartilage, and is mserted in a radiated manner into the mner and back part of the Fig. 175. ^ase of the arytenoid cartilage, and to the inner side of its anterior process, behind the inferior vocal cord. This ligament is veiy strong, but yet sufficiently loose to allow of certain extensive movements. There is also a very loose synovial capsule, which can be easily demonstrated. The movements of this articulation, like those of all similar joints, take place in every direction ; but the movements inwards and outwards are much more ex- tensive than those which are performed forwards and backwards. On account of the mode of insertion of its muscles, the arytenoid cartilage is not moved in a direct line, but undergoes a partial rotatory movement, the centre of which is in the articulation. In the move- ment, which is oblique, on account of the obliquity of the articular surfaces, the apex of the arytenoid car- tilage is carried either outwards and backwards or inwards and forwards. These motions should be studied with the greater care, because they afford an explanation of the changes which take place in the glottis during the pro- duction of the voice. The aryteno-epiglottid ligament. This ligament (b, figs. 176, 177.) is con- stituted by some radiated ligamentous fibres contained within the aryteno- epiglottid fold of mucous membrane, and which pass from the anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage to the corresponding margin of the epiglottis. In some animals, this ligament is replaced by muscular fibres. TTie thyro-arytenoid ligaments, or chorda vocales. Although there is no imme- diate relation between the thyroid and the arytenoid cartilages, they are united by four very important ligaments, named the chorda vocales, which require a special description. The chorda vocales are also called the vocal bands, the ligaments of Ferrein, or the thyro-arytenoid ligaments, because they have a ligamentous appearance, and extend from the retreating angle of the thyroid cartUage to the arytenoid cartilages. There are two vocal cords on each side, a superior (s,figs. 176. 178.) and an inferior (r) ; the space between them is called the ventricle of the larynx (y), and the interval between the cords of the right and left sides is called the glottis (fi,fig. 178.) *. I shall speak of these parts again presently. * [In consequence of the voice being essentially produced opposite the ittferior cords, tlmy are termed the true vocal cords; the superior being called the false vocal cords ]SPLANCHNOLOGY. e lorm ot a rounded fibrous cord, stretched horizontaUy from the re- treating angle of the thyroid cartilage to the anterior pro- cess of the arytenoid cartilage. It is free in all directions exceptmg on the outside, where it is in contact with the thyro-arytenoid muscle. Its free portion is covered by the mucous membrane of the larynx, which adheres inti- mately to It, and is so thin that the white colour of the cord can be seen through it. This vocal cord is thinner than It appears at first sight, the projection which it forms bemg m a great measure due to the thyro-arytenoid muscle. Its structure is entirely ligamentous, and con- sists of paraUel fibres, running from before backwards, and not at all elastic* It is continuous below with the lateral thyro-cricoid ligament (rf). The superior vocal cord (s) is smaller, and situated farther from the axis of the larynx than the inferior one (see^^. 178.), and extends from the middle of the retreating angle of the thyroid cartilage to the middle of the anterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage: like the inferior cord, it has a fasciculated and fibrous appearance ; but the fascicuU are few in number, and are intermixed with a series of glandular masses. The superior vocal cord can only be dis- inguished from the rest of the parietes of the larynx, from the reflection of the mucous membrane below it, so as to form the ventricle. It is continuous demarcatio7^™°'^^'^'°"''^ ligament {b,fig. 176.) above, without any line of Muscles of the Larynx. These are divided into the extrinsic and the intrinsic; the former, which move the entire larynx, have been already described, viz. the sterno-hyoid omo-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and thyro-hyoid; to which we might add aU the muscles of the supra-hyoid region, and those muscles of the pharynx which have attachments to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. The intrinsic muscles are nine in number, viz. four pairs and one single muscle. Those which exist in pairs, are the crico-thyroidei, the crico- arytenoidei postici, the crico-arytenoidei laterales, and the thyro-arytenoidei. The single muscle is the arytenoideus. T7ie Crico-thyroideus. Dissection. This muscle is completely exposed by separating the larynx from the muscles by which it is covered. In order to gain a good view of the deep portion of the muscle, the lower part of the thyroid cartilage must be removed. The crico-thyroideus {a, figs. 147. 170.) is a short .thick, triangular muscle, situated on the anterior part of the larynx, on each side of the crico-thyroid membrane, and divided into two distinct bundles. It is attached below to the cricoid cartilage on each side of the median line, to the whole of the anterior surface, and even to part of the lower border of the cartilage. From these points the fleshy fibres radiate in different directions : the internal fibres pass somewhat obliquely upwards and outwards ; the middle ones veiy obliquely, and the lower fibres horizontally outwards, to the lower border of the thyroid cartilage (excepting to its middle portion), and to the lower margin of the corresponding lesser comu. The greatest number of fibres are inserted into * [The inferior vocal cords are certainly composed of elastic tissue, so also are the thyro- hyoid and crico-thyroid ligaments ; and, according to M. Lauth (Mi!»t de I'Acad, lioy.de Sled. 1835), the lateral crico thyroid membranes, the superior vocal cords, and the arrteno-epiglottid ligaments are also composed of this tissue, which, he says, exists even in the thyro.epiglottid, liyo-epiglottid, and glosso-epiglottid ligaments.]569 THE LARYNX. the posterior sui-face of the thyroid cartilage ; some of them are continuous with the inferior constrictor of the pharynx {w,fig. 147.). It is covered by the sterno-thyroid muscle and the thyroid gland, and it covers the lateral crico-arytenoid and the thyro-arytenoid muscles. The bnei borders o^^ crico-thyroid muscles are separated from each other by aTrkngular space, broad above and narrow below, in which the crico-thyroid "ThracirKot yet weU determined. By taking their fixed point upon the cricoid cartilage, it appears to me that they would move the Ayroid ca_r- tilage in such a way as to increase the antero-posterior diameter of the glottis, and thus act as tensors of the vocal cords. The Crico-arytenoideus Posticus. Dissection. This muscle is exposed by removing the mucous membrane from the posterior surface of thetorynx. , , , » It is a triangular muscle (g, \figs. 171. 177.), situated at the back of the cricoid cartilage. Its fibres arise from the lateral depression, which we have described on the posterior surface of the cartilage, and pass in different di- rections ; the upper fibres are the shortest, and are almost horizontal; the middle are oblique, and the lower are nearly vertical; they aU converge to- wards the posterior and external process on the base of the arytenoid cartilage, behind the crico-arytenoideus lateralis. Relations. It is covered by the mucous membrane of the pharynx, to which it is very loosely united, and it covers the cricoid cartilage. Action. It is a dilator of the glottis. It carries the base of the arytenoid cartilage backwards, outwards, and downwards, and thus renders the inferior vocal cord tense. Kg. 177. The Crico-arytenoideus Lateralis. Dissection. Remove with care one of the lateral halves of the thyroid cartilage (as in fg. 177.). It is impossible to separate this muscle from the thyro-arytenoideus. This is an oblong muscle (/), situated deeply under the thyroid cartOage. Its fibres arise from the side of the upper border of the cricoid cartilage, in front of the crico- arytenoid articulation ; from this point they proceed ob- liquely upwards and backwards, to be inserted into the posterior and external process of the arytenoid cartilage, by a tendon common to them, and to the thyro-ary- tenoideus. It is covered by the thyroid cartilage and by the crico-thyroid muscle, and it covers the lateral crico- thyroid membrane (d). The Thyro-arytenoideus. Dissection. The same as for the preceding. This muscle may be dissected from the interior of the larynx, by removing the vocal cords. I describe the thyro-arytenoideus and the crico-arytenoideus lateralis sepa- rately, merely in accordance with custom, for in no instance, not even in large animals, such as the ox, have I ever been able to separate them com- pletely. They have the same arytenoid insertion ; their fibres are situated upon the same plane, without any line of demarcation, and they fulfil the same uses. We might, therefore, unite them under the name of the thyro-crico- arytenoideus. The thyro-arytenoideus (e) is abroad muscle, very thin above, and very thick below. It arises on each side, from about the lower two thirds of the retreat- ing angle of the thyroid cartilage. The greater number of its fibres arise^'^^ SPLANCHNOLOGY. IhZ ?• l°Tr P^'"' ^°Sle, and form a very thick fasciculus. From these points they pass honzontaUy backwards and outwards, and terminate in the following manner. The thick fasciculus above mentioned is inserted into the outer surface of the anterior process of the arytenoid cartilage, and into a depression on the outer side of the base of that cartUage, between the two processes. The upper fibres are attached to the outer border of the arytenoid cartilage. In the larger animals, the upper fibres of the muscle evidently proceed to the epiglottis, and form the thjro-epiglottideus of some authors. Relations. On the outside it corresponds with the thyroid cartilage from which It IS separated by loose and sometimes adipose cellular tissue: on the vnsidsTX is in contact with the vocal cords and the ventricle of the larynx Ihe thickest part of the muscle corresponds with the inferior vocal cord and is almost the only cause of its projecting into the interior of the larynx This fasciculus may even be considered as contained within the substance of the inferior vocal cord, and the two structures are so closely adherent, that great care is required to separate them. Many anatomists, indeed, have thought that the fibres of the thyro-arytenoideus terminate in the vocal cord, which they therefore regarded as the tendon of the muscle; but the cord and muscle may always be completely separated. Action. It carries the arytenoid cartilage forwards, and would thus seem to relax the inferior vocal cord, as HaUer believed: " Cartilagines guttales (the ary- tenoid) antrorsum ducunt, glottidem dilatant, ligamentorum glottidis tensionem minuiint:' (Elementa Physiol, t. iii. liv. 9. p. 387.) But if we consider the mechanism of the crico-arytenoid articulations, and the mode of insertion of the thyro-arytenoid muscles into the outer side of the bases of the arytenoid cartilages, we shall perceive that, at the same time that these cartilages are carried forwards, they undergo a partial rotatory movement, by which their anterior processes are turned inwards. The ligaments of the glottis are there- fore rendered tense, and approximated towards each other. This movement may be carried to such an extent that the anterior processes may touch, and the antero-posterior diameter of the glottis be diminished accordingly. * The thyro-arytenoideus is then both a tensor and a constrictor of the glottis. This, moreover, was the opinion of both Cowper and Albinus, but Haller attempted to refute it. f The sudden action of the thyro-arytenoid muscle, pressing upon the ven- tricle of the larynx, may expel any mucus collected within it. The Arytenoideus. Dissection. Remove the mucous membrane and glandular masses which cover it behind. Detach it along one of its borders, so as to be enabled to examine its thickness. _ The^ arytenoideus (a, fig. 171.) is a single, short, thick, trapezoid muscle, situated behind the arytenoid cartilages, and filling up the concavity on their posterior surfaces, as well as the interval between them. It arises from the whole length of the outer border of the right arytenoid cartilage, and is inserted into the corresponding part of the left. Some of the fibres arise from the upper border of the cricoid cartilage. The fibres have a triple direction, and form three layers, which have been regarded as so many distinct muscles. The two more superficial layers are oblique, and cross each other; one pass- ing from the base of the right arytenoid cartilage to the apex of the left, and the other following the opposite direction; they constitute the arytenoideus obliquus of Albinus : both of these layers are thin. * [The effect of this will be as stated by Haller, to relax the vocal cords, which is considered by the latest observers to be the action of these muscles.] t Loc. cit.

It would appear, at first sight, that this muscle must forcibly ap- proximate the two arytenoid cartilages, and therefore constrict the glottis ; but if we remember that it is attached to the outer borders of these cartilages, we shaU understand that, besides drawing them together, it must produce in them such a movement as wiU carry their anterior processes outwards, and stretch the vocal cords, but at the same time separate them from each other. And if we caU to mind that the thyro-arytenoideus occasions an exactly op- posite movement, it will be understood that the simultaneous action of the two muscles must produce tension of the cords, and, at the same time, fix the processes. Having thus obtained a knowledge of the cartilages of the larynx, the arti- culations by which they are united, and the muscles which move them, we shall now proceed to give a general description of this organ. TTie Larynx in general. The larynx, the general position of which has been already described, pre- sents certain differences in its dimensions, depending either upon the individual, upon sex, or upon age. These differences affect both the whole of the larynx and its constituent parts. Thus, the larynx of the female may always be distinguished from that of the male, by being smaller, i. e. about two thirds the size of the male larynx; and by the angles and processes of its cartilages being less pro- minent, and their depressions less marked. These differences are connected with the characters of the voice, and affect principally the dimensions of the glottis. The individual differences in the size of the larynx have not been thoroughly examined. The differences depending on age wiU be noticed when speaking of its developement. The larynx presents for our consideration an external and an internal surface. Hie external surface of the larynx — anterior region {fig. 170.). In the me- dian line we observe a vertical ridge, formed by the angle of the thyroid car- tilage ; beneath this the crico-thyroid membrane, and stiU lower the convexity of the cricoid cartilage. On the sides we find the oblique laminae of the thyroid cartilage, a portion of the cricoid covered by the crico-thyroid muscle, and the thyro-cricoid articulation. Subcutaneous in the median line, where it is only separated from the skin by the linea alba of the neck, the external surface of the larynx is covered on each side by the muscles of the sub-hyoid region, the inferior constrictor of the pharynx, and the thyroid gland. The superficial position of the surface enables us to examine its different parts through the integuments, and renders it liable to wounds. Its still greater proximity to the skin in the median line has suggested the operation of laryngotomy. Foslerior region {figs. 141. 171.).

The internal surface of the larynx does not correspond either m shape or dimensions with its outer surface; and this depends principally on the fact, that the retreating angle of the thyroid is the only part of that cartilage which enters into the formation of the laryngeal cavity, the lateral lamina; being altogether unconcerned in it. Cylindrical below, where it is formed by the cricoid cartUage, the cavity ot the larynx is prismatic and triangular above, where it is constituted by the epiglottis in front, the arytenoid cartilages and the arytenoid muscle behind and on the sides by the two mucous folds which extend from the margins of the epiglottis to the arytenoid cartilages. The dimensions of the lower of these two portions of the laryngeal cavity undergo no change, always remaining the same as those of the cricoid cartilage; while the upper, on the contrary, which is broadest in front, varies much in size in consequence of the mobility of the epiglottis and the arytenoid cartilages. Between these two portions, and about the middle of the larynx, a fissure exists, which is narrower than the rest of the cavity, and oblong from before backwards; this is the glottis, or vocal apparatus properly so called. It can be seen without any dissection, by looking down into the larynx (fg. 178.), and requires a very particular de- scription. The glottis, or vocal apparatus. The glottis (yXwrrh, from yAda-rrii, the tongue), frequently confounded with the superior orifice of the larynx*, is a triangular p. ,.g opening or fissure (o,fig. 178.) (rima), elongated from be- s ■ fore backwards, and included between the vocal cords of the right and left sides. It represents two isosceles tri- angles, placed one above the other, and having perfectly equal borders, the base of each being directed backwards, and its apex forwards. The lower isosceles triangle is formed by the inferior vocal cords (r), and the upper one by the superior vocal cords (s). The inferior vocal cords are situated nearer to the axis of the larynx than the superior, so that a vertical plane let faU from the latter would leave the inferior vocal cords on its inner side, p Many authors limit the term glottis to the lower triangle. This view is supported by the absence of the superior vocal cords in a great number of animals, the ox in particular. * This error is perhaps to be attributed to the use of the word epiglottis, so much do words influence our ideas. It was committed even in Haller's time, who says, "Etiam hoc (lart/nfiis) ostium non bene pro glotlidc sumitur."THE LARYNX. 573 n.-fflPMcnrx! of the alottis. The glottis is the narrowest part of the larynx, and hefc th da^gCK^^^ introluction of a foreip hody into it and from the format on of fflse membranes in this situation. The only action of the mtnn^c muscles of the larynx is to dilate or contract the opening of the glo tis. We Tve seen that, wi^h the exception of the crico-thyroidei, they are aU in some mei^ure collected round the crico-arytenoid articulation, the movements of which determine the dimensions of the glottis. u ■* „^ -hocc The individual differences which constitute the tenor, baritone, or hass voices in singing depend upon the size of the glottis ; to which, also, must be attributed the difference between the male and female voice, and the change produced in its tone at the time of puberty. A deep voice coincides with a large glottis, and a shriU voice with a small one. In the adult male the antero- posterior diameter of the glottis is from ten to eleven hnes, in the female it is only eight lines ; in the male the greatest transverse diameter is from three to four lines, in the female from two to three lines.* From these dimensions it may be understood how a louts dor might pass edo-ewise through the glottis, and thus faU into the trachea. In a case of this kind, most of those who were called in consultation rejected the idea of the presence of the coin in the windpipe, because, said they, the glottis cannot admit it. The patient died in about a year, and the louis d'or was found in the Venlricle of the larynx. Between the superior and inferior vocal cords of each side there is a cavity, called the ventricle or sinus of the larynx {v,fig. 176. 178.) ; it is oblong from before backwards, and of the same length as the cords ; its depth is determined by the interval separating the cords from the thyroid cartilage, or rather from the thyro-arytenoid muscle, which forms the bottom of the corresponding ventricle. The opening of the ventricle is some- what narrower than the bottom, is elliptical in its longest diameter, and has admitted the introduction of a foreign body. To each ventricle there is a supplementary cavity, which is acciu-ately described and figured in the works of Morgagni.f This cavity resembles in shape a Phrygian cap; it has a broad base opening into the ventricle, and a narrow apex; it is found at the anterior part of the ventricle, and is prolonged on the outer side of the superior vocal cord between it and the thyroid cartilage, upon the side of the epiglottis. Its dimensions vary much. In one case its vertical diameter ■was six lines, and it was divided into two parts by a transverse band. The circumferences of the larynx. The superior circumference of the larynx {fig. 178.) is much wider than the inferior, and presents the following objects : —the superior angular border of the thyroid cartilage, and the great comua in ■which it terminates; behind the thyroid cartilage, the epiglottis (i); and between the cartilage and the epiglottis, a small triangular space filled by a compact fatty mass, which has been incorrectly described as the epiglottid gland. I have already said that this fatty mass is bounded above by a fibrous membrane, extending from the epiglottis to the posterior surface of the os hyoides. Behind the epiglottis, ■we find the upper orifice of the larynx, which must not be confounded with the glottis ; it slopes obliquely from before backwards and from above downwards, having the form of a triangle, with its base directed forwards and its apex backwards, consequently in the opposite direction to the glottis. This orifice is formed in front by the free margin of the epiglottis, which is slightly notched ; on each side by the upper part of the lateral margin of the epiglottis, and by the free edge of the aryteno-epiglottid fold (6); and be- * These measurements are taken at the level of the inferior vocal cords; the transverse diameter is rather longer opposite the superior vocal cords. t I first saw this cavity in a patient affected with larjjngeal phthisis, in whom it was very much developed. 1 then examined the larynx in other individuals, and found it to be con- stant. I did not then know tliat Morgagni had pointed it out and figured it. {Advcrs. i. Episi Anat. viii.) 'SPLANCHNOLOGY. hind by the cornicula laryngis, and by the summits of the arytenoid cartilaees (.a;, and the deep notch between them. The superior orifice is the widest part of the larynx, and admits foreign bodies which cannot pass through its lower portion. The epiglottis when de- pressed generally covers it completely, and may even overlap it at the sides. The inferior circumference of the larynx is perfectly circular, is formed by the cricoid cartilage, and is continuous with the trachea. Tlie mucous membrane and glands of the larynx. The mucous membrane of the larynx is a continuation of that of the mouth and pharynx. The larynx presents the only example in the body of an organ, part of whose external surface, namely the posterior, is covered with mucous membrane; and this de- pends upon the circumstance of its forming part of the parietes of the pharynx. The mucous membrane is disposed in the following manner: From the base of the tongue it is reflected upon the anterior surface of the epiglottis, forming the three glosso-epiglottid folds already described, one in the middle and one on each side; it adheres pretty closely to the epiglottis, is reflected over its free margin, covers its posterior surface, and penetrates into the larynx; on each side it passes from the epiglottis to the arytenoid cartilages, and becomes continuous with the pharyngeal mucous membrane, which covers the back of the larynx. At the superior orifice of the larynx it is reflected upon itself to form the aryteno-epiglottid folds, which con- stitute the sides of the supra-glottid region of the larynx ; it then covers the superior vocal cord, and lines the ventricle, sending a prolongation into its sup- plementary cavity. In the ventricle it is remarkable for its slight adhesion to the subjacent parts. It is reflected from the ventricle upon the inferior vocal cord ; there, as well as opposite the superior cord, it is so thin, that it does not conceal the pearly appearance of the ligament beneath, to which it adheres so closely that it is ditficult to separate them. Lastly, it covers the internal sur- face of the cricoid cartilage, and the middle and lateral crico-thyroid mem- branes. The laryngeal mucous membrane is characterised by its tenuity, its adhe- sion to the parts beneath it, and by its pale pink colour.* It is perforated by the openings of a number of mucous glands. Its extreme sensibility, espe- cially at the upper orifice and in the supra-glottid portion of the larynx, is well- known.f The aryteno-epiglottid folds, which include the ligaments of the same name, and some muscular fibres in the larger animals, are remarkable for the great quantity of very loose cellular tissue which they contain ; this fact explains their liability to a serous infiltration, called oedema of the glottis, which proves rapidly fatal. The glands of the larynx. The glands of the larynx are the epiglottid and the arytenoid. The thyroid gland, or body, cannot be considered as belonging to the larynx ; if it belongs to any organ, it must be to the trachea. The epiglottid glands. The name of epiglottid gland is generally given to the fatty mass already described as being situated between the thyroid carti- lage and the epiglottis ; and it has even been asserted that it opens by special ducts on the posterior surface of the epiglottis. But there is no other epiglottid gland, besides those situated in the substance of the epiglottis, which is perfor- ated with innumerable holes for their reception: these small glands are so numerous, that Morgagni (Advers. i. 2.; v. 68.) regarded them as forming a single gland; they aU open upon the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis by * TThe epithelium of the laryngeal mucous membrane is, in the greater p^t of its extent, columnar and ciliated. The cilia urge the secretion upwards ; according to Dr. Henle, they extend higher up in front than on each side and behind ; on the sides, for example as high as the border of the superior vocal cords, or about two lines above them, and ra front upon the posterior surface of the epiglottis, as high as its base or widest portion. Above these points the epithelium gradually assumes the laminated form, like that in t>e -"""'h P'>;Y^",VLp, .up t It has been observed, in experiments upon aninials and in introducing the canula after the operation of laryngotomy, that the sensibility of the mucous membrane beyond the glottis is much less acute.THE LARYNX. 575 very distinct orifices, from which a considerable quantity of mucus can be pressed.

Ve"nd nerves. The arteries are derived from the superior thyroid a branch of the external carotid, and from the inferior thyroid, a branch of the subclavian. The veins enter the corresponding venous trunks. The lymphalw vessels, which are little known, terminate principally m the glands of the supra- hyoid region, if we may judge from the frequency of their inflammation in cases of acute laryngitis, &c. _ . , „ • The nerves are branches of the pneumogastric, viz. the superior and the in- ferior or recurrent laryngeal. The superior laryngeal nerves are not exclusively distributed to the muscles caUed constrictors of the glottis (the arytenoideus and the crico-thyroidei) ; nor do the inferior laryngeals belong exclusively to those caUed dilators (the crico-arytenoidei postici and laterales, and the thyro- arytenoidei), as a celebrated physiologist has affirmed. (See Neurology.) The peculiar rotatory movement of the arytenoid cartilages somewhat interferes with any classification of these muscles into dilators and constrictors. Developement. The evolution of the larynx is remarkable in this respect, that after having attained a certain size, it undergoes no appreciable change until the time of puberty. The ventricles are as yet so slightly developed that their existence has been denied. The prominence of the os hyoidesin some measure conceals that of the larynx. M. Richerand {Mem. de la Societe Med. d' Emula- tion, torn, iii.) has proved that there is no very remarkable difference between the larynx of a child at three years of age and of one at twelve. Up to the age of puberty the larynx presents no trace of the sexual differences, which afterwards become so evident; and to these anatomical conditions are owing the shrillness and uniformity of the voice in the youth of both sexes. At the period of puberty, at the same time as the genital organs, the larynx increases so rapidly as to attain its full developement in the space of one year ; the voice then loses its uniformity, and acquires its peculiar timbre and quality, and then also the sexual differences in the vocal apparatus become manifest. Is it from an unequal developement of the different parts of the larynx, or from want of a certain degree of education, that the voice at this period is so discordant, especially in singing, or breaks, as it is said ? The simultaneous developement of the genital organs and the larynx has led to the opinion, that they stand to each other in the relation of cause and effect; and observation has established that the vocal apparatus is in some measure under the influence of the generative organs ; for in eunuchs the larynx re- mains as small as it is in the female. (M. Dupuy tren, Mem. de la Soc. Phil. torn, ii.) At the age of puberty the size of the glottis is increased by one third in the female, and is nearly doubled in the male. After puberty, any changes which the larynx may undergo are the result of exercise, not of developement properly so called. Ossification of the cartilages of the larynx is not always the effect of age. I have seen it at the thirtieth year, quite independently of disease. Chronic inflammation of the larynx induces a premature ossification of the cartilages. The thyroid has the greatest tendency to this change, then the cricoid, and lastly the arj-tenoid cartilages : I have never observed it in the epiglottis. " Gnomonis, sed obtusanguli figuram utervis acervus habot." {tlaller.)SPLANCHNOLOGY. Functions. The larynx is the organ of voice. Numerous experiments upon living animals, and many surgical facts, show that the vocal sound is produced exclusively in the larynx. The lungs, the bronchi, and the trachea perform, ■with regard to the voice, the office of an elastic conductor of air, capable of contraction and dilatation, of shortening and elongation. The thorax acts like a pair of bellows, by which the air is driven into the larynx with any wished for degree of force ; and hence the quantity of air passing through the larynx, and the rapidity with which it moves, may vary to a very great What then is the mechanism of the voice ? Is it the same as that of a horn {Dodart), of a stringed instrument {Ferrein), of a flute (Cuvier), of a reed in- strument (Biot and Mayendie), or of a bird-call* {Savart) ? Is it produced by the vibration of the tense vocal cords, or merely by the vibration of the air whilst passing through a narrow opening, which is itself incapable of vibrating ? We shall leave these questions to the decision of physiologists. It is sufficient for our purpose to know that the action of the muscles of the larynx and the ar- rangement of the vocal apparatus are perfectly fitted to produce either dilata- tion or contraction of the glottis ; and such is the mechanism of this part, that, from the rotatory movement of the arjrtenoid cartilages, the vocal cords are always rendered tense, whatever may be the other actions of the muscles. The voice as it issues from the larynx is simple, for the larynx is, with re- gard to the voice, what the mouth-piece is in the flute, or the reed in the bassoon; but during its passage through the vocal tube, composed of the epi- glottis, the pharynx, the isthmus of the fauces, the mouth, and the nasal fossae, the voice becomes modified. According to a very ingenious theory of M. Magendie, the epiglottis re- sembles those soft and moveable valves which M. Grenie places in the pipes of an organ, to enable the sound to be increased without modifying the tone. The isthmus of the fauces resembles the superior larynx of birds, which consists of a contractile orifice that can be diminished, and even closed at pleasure ; and it is principally owing to this mechanism, that the small glottis of birds can execute such an extensive range of notes. We know, in fact, that the tone of a wind instrument is reduced an octave lower, by completely closing the lower orifice of the tube, and that when it is only partially closed, the tone is depressed in proportion. Now the isthmus of the fauces acts ex- actly like the superior larynx of birds. On watching a person who wishes to utter a very low note, we see that he depresses and flexes the head slightly upon the neck, so as to approximate the chin to the thorax : by this means the vertical diameter of the isthmus of the fauces is diminished, the larynx being carried upwards, whilst the velum palati is depressed: and from this we may judge of the important part performed by the velum, in producing mo- dulations of the voice. If to this we add the changes which may be effected in the length and diameter of the pharynx (see Pharynx), and if we remember that by dimi- nishing by one half the length or diameter of the tube or body of a wind instrument, its tone is raised one octave, we shall be able to understand how the human voice can execute so extensive a scale of notes, although the glottis is so small. The voice is also modified while traversing the buccal and nasal cavities. Do the nasal fossae favour the resonance of the voice ? or does the air when passing through them, merely give rise to certain sounds denominated nasal? The latter opinion, which is supported by Mr. Gerdy, appears to me the most consistent with facts. MM. Biot and Magendie had already correctly » A bird-call is a cavity with elastic ■walls, perforated upon the two opposite sides. The cavity is represented by the ventricles, and the openings by the intervals between the vocal cords. It a tube capable of contracting and dilating be fitted to such an instrument, an infinite variety of sounds may be produced.THE THYROID GLAND. 577 observed that the voice becomes nasal, only when it traverses these pas- The voice becomes articulate in passing through the mouth, i. e. the vocal sound is interrupted, and modified by the more or less rapid percussion of the lips and tongue against the teeth and the palate. Articulate voice is very distinct from speech. Animals which differ much from man in the conformation of their vocal organs, the parrot for example, may be made to articulate; but speech is the peculiar attribute of man, be- cause he alone is possessed of intelligence. The Thyroid Gland. The thi/roid gland, or thyroid body, is a glanduliform organ, the uses of which are unknown : it is situated, like a crescent with its concavity directed up- wards, in front of the first rings of the trachea, and upon the sides of the larynx. In describing this organ in connection with the larynx, I follow the usual custom, which has arisen not from any direct relation between their func- tions, but from their contiguity to each other. The thyroid body varies much in size in different individuals; there are few organs which present greater varieties in this respect. The sexual differences in the size of this organ, like all those relating to the vocal apparatus, are very well marked, but in an inverse manner, that is to say, the thyroid body is larger in the female, in whom it forms a rounded projection, which assists in making the thyroid cartilage in that sex appear still less prominent. Climate, and more especially certain qualities in the water used as drink, have a remarkable influence upon its size, which, in many cases of goitre, is enormous. These differences in size affect either the whole of the gland equally, or only one lobe, or occasionally the middle portion alone. The weight of the thyroid body, which is about an ounce, may be increased to a pound and a half, or even more. Form. The thyroid body is generally composed of two lateral lobes or comua, united by a contracted portion, flattened from before backwards, and called the isthmus. The varieties in shape principally affect the isthmus, which may be very narrow, long or short, regular or irregular, or entirely absent, or it may be as thick and as long from above downwards as the lobes themselves. I have seen one case in which the thickest part of the thyroid gland was in the middle, and the lobes terminated above in a very narrow point. The opmion of the ancients, and which is also met with in Vesalius, that the human subject has two thyroid glands, no doubt arose from the narrow- ness or absence of the isthmus, or rather from the separation and complete independence of the two lobes in a great number of animals. The surface of the thyroid body is smooth and well defined, and sometimes divided into lobules by superficial furrows. We shall examine in succession the relations of the middle and lateral portions: — The middle portion or isthmus is convex in front, and is separated from the skin by all the muscles of the sub-hyoid region. Behind, where it is concave, it is in contact with the first rings of the trachea. Moreover, this middle portion descends to a greater or less distance in diflFerent subjects, and some- times so low, that there is not room to perform tracheotomy between it and the sternum. Each lateral lobe is convex in front, and corresponds with the muscles of the sub-hyoid region : in particular I ought to mention the sterno-thyroid bv which It is directly covered, and the breadth of which seems to be nronor VOL. I. p P ^ ^578 SPLANCHNOLOGY. tioncd to tlie size of the lobe: in many cases of goitre, I have seen this muscle twice or three times as broad as in the natural state. On the inside, each lateral lobe is concave, so as to be applied to the side of the trachea and cricoid cartilage, to the lower and lateral part of the thyroid cartilage, to the lower part of the pharynx, and to the upper part of the oesophagus. The two lobes, together with the middle portion or isthmus, form a half or sometimes three- fourths of a canal, which embraces all those parts ; an extremely important relation, which explains how, in certain goitres, the trachea is flattened on the sides, deglutition is impeded, and true asphyxia by strangulation is the final result. Behind, each lateral lobe corresponds with the vertebral column, from which it is separated, on the outside, by the common carotid artery, the in- ternal jugular vein, and the pneumogastric and great sympathetic nerves, which, according to the size of the gland, are either covered by it, or are merely in relation with its outer surface. The upper extremity of each lateral lobe terminates in a point, and hence the two-horned figure assigned to the thyroid body ; it is situated on the in- side of the carotid artery, in contact with the lateral and back part of the thyroid cartilage, and sometimes extends nearly to its upper border. Its lower extremity is thick and rounded, descends to a greater or less distance in dif- ferent individuals, and corresponds to the fifth, sixth, or seventh rings of the trachea: it is situated between the trachea and the common carotid. The inferior thyroid artery enters the gland at its lower extremity. Its upper border is concave and notched in the middle ; the superior thyroid arteries run along it. A prolongation extends from this border, which has been correctly represented by Bidlpo, and named the pyramid by Lalouette. It almost always exists ; it passes perpendicularly upwards, either on the right or left side of the median line, and presents numerous varieties in several respects Thus it varies in its origin, sometimes arising from the isthmus, and sometimes from one of the lobes at one side of the isthmus; also in its termination, sometimes ending opposite the notch in the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, sometimes opposite the thyro-hyoid membrane, and at other times even on a level with the body of the os hyoides; but always firmly adherent either to the membrane or the bone. It also vanes in its structure • sometimes it is a fibrous cord, and sometimes a reddish Unear band which has all the appearances of a muscular fasciculus, and has even been'described as a muscle ; it often consists of a series of granules arranged in a line; sometimes again we find, in the middle, or at one end of the cord a elanduliform enlargement, exactly resembling the tissue of the thyroid ffland • lastly, it may be double, or bifurcated, or even completely wanting; in which'case, however, there exists a glanduliform mass of a certain height This prolongation, in which I and many others have m vain attempted to fand an excretory duct, is evidently of a compact nature. Is it the remams of a foetal structure, or the trace of a normal disposition in some animals ? The lower border of the thyroid body is convex, more or less deeply notched in the centre, and is in contact with the inferior thyroid arteries. SMre The proper tissue of the thyroid gland is of a vanable colour, somftimes resembUng the lees of port wine, and sometimes of a yeUowish hue n of tolerably ^rl consistence, and feels granular. This organ presents all L anatomical characters of glands, and like them may be separated by dis- secti^ X glandular grains ; but with this difference, that these grains com- mSdcatrwith each other, whilst, in ordinary glands, they are independent ThToommmication of the glandular grains may be shown in the foUowing 2Ler~ e of a mercurial injecting apparatus be i-erted into tbe ^vrnid "jrland the mercury will enter into and distend the cells and after a Per aTn tfiTSl the g^^^^^^ be injected : it is easy to satisfy the mind that th mercury S no fnfiltrated into the ceUular tissue,, but i^eontamed >n ^le fssu^ of the gland itself, in the centre of the granulations. The right and left579 THE THYROID GLAND. lobes do not communicate, but all the granulations of each lobe communicate ■with each other. The thyroid gland has, therefore, a vesicular structure ; and we have seen that the glandular grains of all glands are spongy and porous, and that the products of their secretion may be accumulated in these pores. The glandular nature of the thyroid body is also shown by the viscid, limpid, yellowish fluid which pervades it in certain subjects, and which may be col- lected in sufficient quantity for chemical analysis; and also by the retention of this matter within a greater or less number of the vesicles when their orifices of communication with the neighbouring vesicles become obliterated. But in connection with this view regarding its glandular nature, we seek in vain for an excretory duct. If we examine the trachea and the larynx, or lay open the oesophagus, and then press the thyroid gland, we shall see that no fluid escapes into those canals. It has been asserted, indeed, that the excretory duct of the thyroid gland terminated in the foramen cacum of the tongue, in the. ventricles of the larynx, or in the trachea opposite its first ring; but, after the example of Santorini, we are compelled to reject these fancied and too hastily announced discoveries. I may here notice the intimate adhesion of the side of the thyroid gland to the first ring of the trachea. This can be very well shown by detaching the gland from behind forwards : it is of a fibrous nature, and I have sometimes thought that I saw a duct in the centre of it, passing through the membrane which connects the trachea with the cricoid cartilage, though I have never been able satisfactorily to demonstrate it. Still I do not think that the absence of an excretory duct should remove the thyroid from amongst the glandular organs; for I believe that there exist in the body glands without excretory ducts, as the thymus, the suprarenal capsules, and the thyroid body. The secretion of the gland is entirely absorbed, and fulfils certain unknown uses. Arteries. The size and the number of the arteries distributed to the thyroid gland indicate that somethiag more than a mere nutritive process must be carried on in it. The arteries are sometimes four, sometimes five in number : two superior arise from the external carotid; two inferior from the subclavian, and the fifth, or the thyroid artery of Neubauer, where it exists, arises from the arch of the aorta. The veins are proportionally as large as the arteries, and form so considerable a plexus in front of the trachea, as, in certain cases, to have prevented the com- pletion of the operation of tracheotomy. The lymphatic vessels terminate in the cervical lymphatic glands. The nerves are derived from the pneumogastrics, and the cervical ganglia of the sympathetic. A thin cellular membrane envelopes the gland, and sends very delicate pro- longations into its substance, where we find a very firm cellular tissue, always destitute of fat. Developement. The thyroid gland is developed in two lateral halves, which are afterwards united by a median portion. It is not uninteresting to re- mark, that this disposition, which is transitory in the foetus, represents the permanent condition of the gland in a great number of animals. During mtra-utenne life and infancy it is relatively larger than at subsequent periods Nevertheless, the changes \«hich it afterwards undergoes are not to be com- pared with those that occur in the thymus ; and we cannot say, as of the latter structure, that the existence of the thyroid body has any peculiar relations with foetal life. Functions. It is a secreting organ, but the uses of its fliiid are not known.580 SPLANCHNOLOGY. THE GENITO-URINARY ORGANS. I HAVE thought it proper to describe the genital and the urinary organs to- gether, because, although their functions are very distinct, yet they have the most intimate anatomical, physiological, and pathological connections. THE DRINARY ORGANS. Division.— The Kidneys and Ureters.— The Bladder.— TTie Suprarenal Capsules. The urinary organs form a very complex secretory apparatus, consisting of two secreting organs, the kidneys; of two provisional reservoirs, the calyces and the pelvis of each kidney; of two excretory ducts, the ureters; of a se- cond and final reservoir, the bladder; and lastly, of a second and final ex- cretory canal, which, in the male, is common to both the genital and the urinary organs, viz. the canal of the urethra. The Kidneys. The kidneys {vefpoi) are glandular organs, intended to secrete the urine. They are deeply situated {h k,fig. 199.) in the lumbar region, hence called the region of the kidneys, on each side of the vertebral column, externally to the peritoneum, which merely passes in front of them; they are surrounded by a great quantity of fat, and, as it were, suspended by the vessels which pass into and emerge from them. Fixed firmly in this situation, they are but little liable to displacement. Most of the changes in their position are congenital. The right kidney gene- rally descends a little lower than the left, doubtless on account of the presence of the liver. One of the kidneys may not uncommonly be found in front of the vertebral column, or even in the cavity of the pelvis; and this unusual arrangement may, in certain cases, render diagnosis very obscure.* 1 have frequently found the right kidney in the corresponding iliac fossa in females who had been in the habit of wearing very tight stays. This displacement happens when the pressure of the stays upon the liver forces the kidney out of the depression in which it is lodged in the lower surface of that organ. Number. The kidneys are,two in number. It is not very uncommon to find only one, which is almost always formed by the union of the two, by means of a transverse portion crossing in front of the vertebral column, and havmg its concave border directed upwards. , , v Sometimes the two united kidneys are situated in the right or left lumbar region or in the cavity of the true pelvis. Cases of union of the two kidneys should be distinguished from those in which one of them is atrophied. Again Blasius, FaUopius, Gavard, &c. relate examples of individuals having three kidneys ; in some of these cases, two were situated upon the same side, in others the supernumerary kidney was placed in front of the vertebral column Size The kidney is not subject to such great variations in size as most other organs. Its ordinary dimensions are from three and a half to four inches in length, two inches in breadth, and one inch in thickness.

Kcure The shape of the kidnev may be weU compared to a bean, with tne hiluf'rned inwards. This foiW enables us to consider its two surfaces and '''^SrThe anterior surface of the kidney is directed slightly outwards ; it is convex t, and is covered by the lumbar colon but sometmes only by the peritoneum, the gut lying to its inner side ; on the left side it is also in re at on with the spleen and the great tuberosity of the stomach, and on the right side with the liver and the second portion of the duodenum. _ The relations of the right kidney with the liver are more or less extensive ; sometimes it is entirely covered by the liver ; in other instances it is inclined downwards, and has no relation with that organ. The gall-bladder sometimes lies upon the anterior surface of the right kidney through the whole ot its ex- tent. Lastly, I have seen the kidney in immediate relation with the parietes of the abdomen, through which it could be easily felt. As practical inferences from these relations, we would notice the difliculty of exploring the kidneys from the anterior surface of the abdomen, on account of their deep situation, also the possibility of an abscess of the kidney opening into the colon. . The posterior surface is less convex than the anterior, and is turned inwards ; it corresponds with the quadratus lumborum, from which it is separated by the anterior layer of the fascia of the transversalis muscle ; with the diaphragm, which separates it from the two or three lower ribs; and with the psoas, which intervenes between it and the vertebral column. These relations explain the possibility of exploring the kidney in the lumbar region through the quadratus lumborum, account for abscesses of the kidney opening in the lumbar region, and for the escape of renal calculi in the same direction, and form the grounds on which the operation of nephrotomy has been proposed. It is of importance to remark, that the relations of the kidneys with the ribs are variable in extent, and that sometimes they do not pass beyond the last rib. The circumference of the kidney presents an external border, convex, semi- elliptical, and directed backwards ; an internal border, directed forwards, and deeply notched in the middle to form the fissure of the kidney (hilus renalis, h, fig. 179.). This notch is more marked behind, where it corresponds with the pelvis of the kidney, than in front, where it corresponds with the renal vein; it is from fifteen to eighteen lines in depth. If we separate the edges of this fissure, we expose a deep cavity containing fat, and called the sinus; in which are seen the pelvis of the kidney (p), the calices (cc c'), and the divisions of the renal artery and vein. The upper end of the kidney is directed inwards, and is more or less com- pletely embraced by the suprarenal capsule; it is generally larger than the lower end, which is directed sUghtly outwards, and projects beyond the last rib. * I do not speak here of enlargement of the kidneys from disease. Many examples of ex- treme enlargement will be found in my work on Pathological Anatomy, liv. i. xviii. t Not unfrequently the fissure of the kidney is found on the anterior surface of that organ. In one case of this Kind the right kidney occupied the ri);ht iliac fossa ; it had two arteries, a superior, which proceeded directly to the fissure, and an inferior, arising from the angle of the bifurcation of the aorta, In front of the middle sacral artery, and terminating at the lower ex- tremity of the kidney.SPLANCHNOLOGY. 582 Fig. 179.

The kidney has no peritoneal covering. The remarkable fetty mass m which it is embedded is called the fatty capsule of the kidnev ^ Pro^'ided with a proper fibrous coat, the external surface of which adheres to the fatty tissue, by means of fibrous lamelte passing through It; Its internal surface is adherent to the tissue of the kidney, throueh the medium of a number of small prolongations, which are very easily lacerated. The tissue of the kidney. The kidney differs from other glands, all of which present a homogeneous and granular texture, in being composed of two substances ; one of these is external, cortical, or glandular (a o), the other internal, medullary, or tubular (6 b b). Some anatomists have described a third substance, the mamillated; but the papillee (dd) of which it is composed belong to the tubular substance. The following is the respective arrangement of these two sub- stances :— The cortical substance forms a soft, reddish, sometimes yellow layer, of a granular appearance, and about two lines in thickness, which occupies the surface of the kidney, and sends prolongations, in the form of pillars or septa from one to three lines thick, between the cones of the tubular substance. The tubular or medullary sub- stance is redder, and presents the appearance of striated cones or pyramids, (the pyramids of Malpighi), the bases of which adhere to the cortical substance, while their free apices are turned towards the sinus, where they appear like papillEB. BeOini, and before him Berenger di Carpi, considered the fibres or striaj of the medullary substance as so many uriniferous tubes (the tubes of Bellini'), and hence the term tubular substance. It follows, then, that the kidney is divided into a number of compartments, corresponding to the number of cones of tubular substance ; there are from ten to twenty of these compartments, which represent the temporary lobules of the human foBtal kidney, and the permanent lobules in the kidneys of the greater ■number of animals.f The kidney, therefore, is formed by the union of a greater or less number of small kidneys, applied together, and connected within a common investment. We shaU see presently, that, in reference to the circulation, these small kidneys are entirely independent of each other. Although the distinction between the two substances is well marked, it is easy to see that some of the fibres or striae of the tubular structure penetrate the cortical substance in a flexuous course, and reach the surface of the organ. This fact was clearly shown by Ferrein, who considered the striae to be the excretory ducts of the granules. These cortical and flexuous portions of the tubes, which become straight a.s soon as Section of kidney.* * This figure is a plan, not an actual representation of the structure of the liidney. t In some animals tlie kidney resembles a bunch of grapes.THE KIDNEYS. 583 P P 4 they reach the mediiUary substance, are termed the cortical ducts, or the con- '''''Y:^rS^SS'^ei the tubes of BeUini under the mic^scope believed that each of them formed a pyramid analogous to those of the tubular sub- stance aSd that each of these secondary pyramids consisted of about a hmidred ducts hence the tubes of the tubular substance have been named the pyramids of Ferrein *, in contradistinction to the pyramids of Malpighi. , , We shaU now examine the structure of the tubular and the cortical sub- ^^'^Structure of the tubular substance. The tubular substance, which at first sight looks like muscular tissue, from its red colour and arrangement m lines, evidently consists of tubes or ducts. . In fact an examination under the simple microscope, of a section made per- pendicularly to the axis of the tubes, demonstrates the existence of a number of small openings, each corresponding to a tube; and if, while the eye is hxed upon the section, the kidney be compressed, urine wiU be seen to exude from all points of the cut surface. Direct injection of the ducts, by means ot a tube containing mercury, introduced at hazard into the tubular substance, will fill all the tubes in whatever direction the instrument may be dii-ected. The ingenious experiment performed by Galvani, who tied the ureters of birds, and by this means obtained an injection of the tubes with the white matter of their urine, leaves no doubt of the existence of these tubes. Lastly, the tubes themselves are collected together in the papillaj, and open either over their entire surface, or in a small depression which some- times exists at their summits. Structure of the cortical substance. The cor- tical substance is tubular and granular. The granules are regularly disposed around the con- voluted tubes of Ferrein. f On examining a thin slice of uninjected kid- ney by the simple microscope, we perceive a great number of oval and spheroidal granules {c",fig. 180.), the acini of Malpighi, which may be separated from each other by maceration; and those granules which have been cut through present that spongy appearance, resembling the pith of the rush, which seems to belong to all glands. When the section is vertical, these cor- I , ^ , puscules are seen appended to the tubes of. i-^ j\ / Ferrein, like grapes upon their stalk. § MaKnifiecuixtjtunlt V^^^els and nervcs.

At the base of the latter the fasciculi spread out, and the straight tubes become the convoluted tubes of the cortical substance (flg. ISO.)- In the human kidney, the tubuU uriniferi are said by Weber to be of a nearly uniform dia- meter throughout their entire course (averaging j^th of an inch); and all appeared to him to end in loops (6 ft), none in free and closed extremities (as at 6'): according to Krause, they ter- minate in both ways. In either case, however, they form a closed system of tubes, independentSPLANCHNOLOGY. 584 markable for its enormous size, in proportion to that of the kidney, for its origin from the aorta being at a right angle, and for its shortness. There are sometimes two or three renal arteries, and two are not unfrequently found twisted spirally around each other. When the kidney is situated in the iliac fossa or in the pelvis, the renal artery or arteries generally arise from the common iliac. The renal vein is as large in proportion as the artery, and passes in front of it into the vena cava. The lymphatic vessels are but little known. The nerves are very numerous, and are derived from the solar plexus; be- sides which, the lesser splanchnic nerve is distributed directly to the kidney. The spermatic nervous plexus is formed by branches from the renal plexus, and this may explain the close sympathy between the testicle and the kidney. The great number of ganglionic nerves distributed to the kidney may accoimt for the peculiar character of the pain experienced in this organ. Injection of the renal vessels. A very coarse injection thrown into the ar- tery will return by the veins. One thrown into the vein will return by the ureter, and not by the artery.* Having filled the artery with red injection, the vein with blue, and the ureter with yellow, I observed the following fects: — The renal artery divides into several branches within the sinus, where it is surrounded with fat; these branches pass between the calyces, and then be- tween the cones of the tubular substance, proceeding as far as the commence- ment of the cortical substance, without giving off any smaller branches: at that point, however, they divide and subdivide so as to form a vascular net- work, the meshes of which are quadrilateral, and of different sizes, inscribed within each other. The largest of these meshes embrace the entire base of each pyramid; the smaller pass in different directions through the substance of the bases. In order to obtain a good view of this arrangement, it is necessary to divide an injected kidney along its convex border, and scrape away the tubular sub- stance, which is so soft as to be easily removed. We shall then perceive that the arterial and venous network, corresponding to the base of each cone, is surrounded by a very thick fibrous sheath, apparently prolonged from the fibrous coat, which passes into the hilus. All the tubular substance being thus removed, the remaining cortical portion of the kidney presents the ap- pearance of a series of perfectly distinct alveoli, each of which corresponds to a cone of the tubular substance. A very beautiful preparation may thus be made. It remains for us to inquire how the arteries terminate. A number of vessels proceed from the convexity of the vascular network above described, traverse the cortical substance, become twisted like tendrils of the vine, and appear to terminate in small red masses, regularly arranged along the convo- luted tubes of Ferrein. These small red masses are formed by the penetration of the injection into the cavity of each granule, as may be seen by examining a section of the kidney with a lens, f If both the artery and the vein be in- jected in the same kidney (and it is of importance that the vein should be injected before the artery, in order to prevent a mixture of the two injections), we shall see that the matter injected by the vein circumscribes that injected by the artery. of the bloodvessels, which merely ramify on their parietes. They are hned with a mucous membrane, continuous with that on the papilla, and having a columnar epithelium. The acini of Malpighi, or granules of M.Cruveilhier (c"}, are not of a glandular nature ; they consist entirely of minute convoluted arteries, which terminate in the veins, but have no direct communication, as was formerly supposed, with the uriniferous tubes ; they arc caUed the glo- meruli.] * [This is the result of rupture.] , t See note, suprd.THE KroNEYS. 585 Almost aU the vessels are destined for the cortical substance, the tubular substance scarcely receiving any branches * : the vessels of any one lobule do not communicate mth those ofthe adjacent lobules.

" When the kidney is the seat of disease, and more particularly when it is distended from an accumulation of urine within the calyces and pelvis, the lobular arrangement re-appears. Each lobule is then converted into a pouch, which is perfectly distmct from those in contact with it. The kidney is proportionaUy larger m the foetus than in the adult. . ■ Functions. The kidneys are the secreting organs of the urine. Ihe urine is secreted by the cortical substance, and as it were filtered by the tubu- lar substance; for perfectly formed urine is found in the former situation. The mechanism of this is not better known than that of other secretions; its rapidity is explained by the great quantity of blood received by the kidneys. TJie Calyces, Pelvis, and Ureter. Dissection. Remove the fat from the sinus, and study the arrangement of the pelvis and calyces externally. Divide the kidney from the convex border towards the hilus. The calyces (c c c',fig. 179.) are funnels {ivfundibula), or rather small mem- branous cylinders, embracing the bases of the papillae by one of their ex- tremities, almost in the same manner as the corolla of a flower embraces the stamina and pistil, and uniting at their other extremity with the adjacent calyces to form the pelvis of the kidney. They vary in number like the papillae, or even more so, for two or three papillse frequently open into the same calyx. Whatever their number may be, they generally unite into three trunks, a superior, a middle, and an inferior, which correspond to the three groups of lobules, into which the kidney may be divided. These three trunks unite to form the pelvis. The external surface of the calyces is in relation with a great quantity of fat, and with the divisions of the renal artery and vein. The pelvis (p) is a small membranous pouch, situated behind the renal ar- tery and vein, opposite the deep notch in the posterior border of the hilus, so that when seen from behind, it projects completely beyond that fissure. It is elongated from above downwards, and flattened from before backwards, and may become greatly dilated from retention of the urine, or from renal calculi: almost immediately after its commencement it becomes smaller, and takes the name of the ureter. In certain cases it would appear that there is no pelvis, and that the ureter succeeds immediately to the two or three trunks formed by the union of the calyces. The pelvis is therefore nothing more than the expanded or infvmdibuliform commencement of the ureter. The ureter {ohphv, urine ; u,figs. 179. 181. 199.) is the excretory duct of the kidney, and extends obliquely from the pelvis of that organ to the inferior fundus (has fond) of the bladder. It is generally single on each side, but * [The vessels {c,flg. 180.) of the tubular portion run parallel with the tubuli from the cor« tical substance to the papilla;; they were mistaken by Ruysch for the tubuli themselves, which were, therefore, supposed by him to communicate with the arteries in the glomeruli.]586 SPLANCHNOLOGY. sometimes double, and that under two very different circumstances-, for example, -where the two kidneys are united into one, a double ureter is almost mvariably found; and, secondly, when, there being two kidneys, one of them IS divided into two very distinct portions. In the latter case the two ureters are often united into one, after a course of a few inches. There is then no pelvis properly so called, and the two ureters may be regarded as the prolonga- tion of the two trunks of the calyces, which remain separate longer than usual. The ureter is a cylindrical tube having whitish, thin, and. extensible pa- rietes. and varying in size from that of a crow's to that of a goose's quill. The most contracted portion of the canal is that situated in the substance of the parietes of the bladder. Occasionally.it presents at various parts of its extent some circumscribed dilatations, which seem to indicate that the course of the urine had been for a time arrested. This canal, is liable to extreme dilatation when any obstacle occurs to the passage of the urine : I have seen it as large as the small intestine. ., , j , Each ureter is directed obliquely downwards and inwards, as far as the, side of the base of the sacrum : from this point (fig. 181.) it passes downwards, forwards, and then inwards iu,fig. 186.), to the lateral part of the inferior fundus (a) of the bladder, where it enters between the muscular and mu- cous coats, and passes obliquely for about ten lines within the substance of that organ, to one of the posterior angles of the trigone, at which point it opens by an orifice narrower than the canal itself, and having the form of a parabolic curve with its concavity directed inwards. Relations. In proceeding from the pelvis of the kidney to the base of the sacrum, the ureter passes along the anterior margin of the psoas, and is co- vered by the peritoneum and by the spermatic vessels, which cross it very obliquely. The right ureter is in relation with the vena cava inferior, being situated on its outer side. Opposite the base of the sacrum, each ureter crosses the common iliac, and then the external Uiac artery and vein of its own side. In the pelvis, the ureter is applied to the parietes of that cavity, is covered by the peritoneum, and crosses in succession the umbilical artery, or the cord by which it is replaced, the obtm'ator vessels, the vas deferens (t,fig. 181.) in the male % and the upper and lateral part of the vagina in the female. That portion of it which is contained within the substance of the walls of the bladder corresponds indirectly with the neck of the uterus; and this im- portant relation explains why carcinoma of the neck of the womb is so fre- quently accompanied with retention of urine. I have also observed that the ureters of all females who have died after delivery, or during the last months of pregnancy, are remarkably dilated. Internal surface. The internal surface of the calyces, pelvis, and ureters is white, smooth, and has longitudinal folds, which are effaced by distension. There are no valves, either at the opening of the calyces into the pelvis, or of the pelvis into the ureter, or in any part of that canal. Structure. The calyces, the pelvis, and the ureter have all the same struc- ture : they are formed by two membranes ; an internal membrane, continuous with the vesical mucous membrane, very thin, and even having the appear- ance of a serous membrane ; it is reflected from the calyces upon the papillse, and is prolonged into the uriniferous tubes : an external membrane, which is very thick, and supposed to be a continuation of the external coat of the kidney, and therefore to be fibrous. Others regard it as muscular f ; I be- lieve that it is formed of a tissue analogous to the dartos. Some arteries and veins, probably also some lymphatics and nerves, are distributed upon the calyces, the pelvis, and the ureters, but do not require any special descrip- tion. * Passing to its outer side. , . . ■ , t [In some quadrupeds the ureter drstmctl.v contracts on applying a stnnnlus.]587 THE BLADDER. The Bladder. The bladder (Ji,fiy- 181.) is a musculo-membranous sac, which serves as a reservoir for the urine. It is situated in the cavity of the pelvis, upon the median line, behind the pubes (6), and is retained in that position by the peri- toneum (m), which only partially co- vers it, and by the urachus, a sort of liga- ment connect- ing it with the umbilicus. These means of attachment are in accord- ance with the great enlarge- ment of which the organ is capable; but they cannot prevent certain partial displacements, known as hernice of the bladder. When collapsed, it is completely protected from external injury ; but when filled, it passes above the osseous girdle in which it is contained, and enters the dilat- able cavity of the abdomen, where it can be distended to the utmost without inconvenience. Number. The bladder is always single; the examples of double bladder which have been recorded, are cases of protrusion of the mucous mem- brane through the separated muscular fibres. But, whatever may be the size of these accidental bladders (and I have seen them twice as large as the true bladder to which they were attached), they may always'be distinguished by their having no muscular coat. The cases of deficiency of the bladder are generally examples of that species of malformation, in which the viscus is open anteriorly, and is everted, so as to resemble a fungous mass. Dimensions. The bladder is the largest of all the reservoirs of secretion, but its capacity varies, from a number of circumstances; from habit — in persons who are accustomed to retain their urine for a considerable period the bladder is more capacious than in those who immediately attend to the desire to pass urine ; from se.r — thus in the female the bladder is generally larger than in the male, because she is more influenced by the customs of society ; from age— the bladder appears to be relatively larger before than after birth; from disease — in consequence of which it presents every variety betweeen a morbid state of contraction in which, from the contact of its parietes, it scarcely permits the accumulation of a spoonful of urine, and an extreme state of dila- tation in which it can hold several pints of that fluid. Direction. The direction of the bladder is determined by that of the anterior wall of the pelvis, so that its axis is oblique from above downwards and back- wards. On account of this obliquity, a slight inclination of the trunk forwards makes the neck of the bladder the most dependent part of the organ. The ob- liquity becomes still greater when the distended bladder has escaped from the588 SPLANCHNOLOGY. pelvis, and entered the cavity of the abdomen: its axis then exactly corre- sponds with that of the brim of the pelvis ; i. e. it is directed from the umbilicus to the lower part of the curvature of the sacrum. It has been said since the time of Celsus, that the upper part of the bladder is a little inclined to the left side, but I have not observed this. Shape. The bladder is ovoid, the great end being directed downwards, and the smaller upwards. Its shape diflFers according to age and sex, and in dif- ferent individuals. The sexual differences are not congenital; they seem to result from the pressure to which the female bladder is subjected during preg- nancy ; but the transverse enlargement and the vertical shortening of the bladder in a female who has borne children are not so weU marked as is generally said. Relations. In determining these, the bladder is divided into \he fundus, which is the highest and the narrowest part; the body, or middle portion, and the base, which is the lowest and the broadest portion. It has, moreover, like all hollow organs, an external and an internal surface. The external surface of the bladder is convex, and presents six regions 'for our consideration; the relations of which we shall now study, both in the col- lapsed and distended condition of the viscus. The anterior region, not covered by the peritoneum, is in relation with the symphysis and bodies of the ossa pubis, and with the internal obturator muscles, with which parts it is connected by a very loose serous cellular tissue, in stout persons more or less loaded with fat. Some fibrous bundles pass from the lower part of this region, and are at- tached to the sides of the symphysis ; they are called the anterior ligaments of the bladder, and are traversed by numerous veins ; they are a dependence of the superior pelvic aponeurosis {q,fig. 181.). (Vide Aponeukology.) In the female, on account of the absence of the prostate, the anterior region of the bladder passes below the symphysis, and advantage may be taken of this circumstance in the extraction of calculi. When the bladder is full, its anterior region cor- responds immediately with the parietes of the abdomen, and sometimes rises as high as the umbilicus. The practical conclusions to be derived from these relations refer to the examination of the bladder in the hypogastrium, to punc- ture of this organ in the same situation, to the high operation for stone, to the operation of dividing the symphysis, and lastly, to ruptui-es of the bladder in consequence of fracture of the pubes.* The posterior region of the bladder is covered by the peritoneum (a) throughout the whole of its extent; in the male it corresponds with the rectum (o), and in the female with the uterus. Some convolutious of the small intestine almost always intervene between the bladder and those parts. The lateral regions are also covered by the peritoneum; and passing upon each of them are found the umbilical artery in the foetus, and subsequently the ligament by which it is replaced, and also the vas deferens (<) in the male. When the bladder is perfectly contracted, there is some distance between it and that vessel and duct on either side. The relations of the lower region or base of the bladder, which are aU very important, differ in the two sexes. In the male it corresponds to the rectum, from which it is separated on either side in front by the vesicula seminalis (s) and the vas deferens, {t ) The only part in direct relation with the rectum is therefore the triangular space {fig. 186 ) comprised between the vesiculae (s s') and the vasa deferentia (/ /') of the two sides. It is of importance to remark, that the peritoneum, where it is re- flected from the rectum upon the posterior region of the bladder, forms a more or less deep cul-de-sac in the middle, and two smaU folds on the sides which have been improperly named the posterior ligaments of the bladder. W hen the bladder is much contracted, the peritoneum covers the whole of the space be- tween the vesicula: and the vasa deferentia; so that, properly speakmg, there is » \t has pven been nroposed to puncture the bladder through the symphysis, by means of a flattened troca? rbutrafficulty of coming exactly upon the symphysis w.U probably prevent the execution of this plan.THE BLADDER. , i^ofwPPn that organ and the rectum.

The vagueness and disagreement n the desciip- fons of thfs sphincter sufiiciently prove that no very distinct structure of he Mnd exists at the neck of the bladder. Winslow describes some fibres arising Lm the ossa pubis, and embracing the sides of the vesical orifice, as the sphincter muscle, but they evidently belong to the levator am. I is certain however that in the neck of the bladder there is a thm external layer of longitudinal muscular fibres, and also a deep and very thick layer formed of circular fibres; both layers seem to be continued into the prostatic portion of the urethra. The mucous coat is extremely thin *, of a whitish colour, and presents some smaU papiUffi. It is so difficult to demonstrate its follicles, that their existence has been denied; but, with a little attention, they may always be found m the neighbourhood of the neck of the bladder, and upon the trigone. I have seen them in all parts of the bladder, under the form of vesicles, m certain cases ot disease. The mucous membrane is moulded upon all the ridges of the mus- cular coat: it sometimes dips between the muscular bundles, and forms cells, in which calculi are often lodged. Bladders of this kind are called sacculated; and moreover are almost always fasciculated, i. e. the muscular fibres are so highly developed, as to raise up the mucous membrane into ridges. The cel- lular tissue uniting the muscular and the mucous coats is tolerably loose, se- rous, and extremely delicate. Vessels and nerves. The vesical arteries arise either directly from the hypo- gastrics, or from their branches. They are variable in number. The veins form a very remarkable plexus around the neck of the bladder, which is pro- longed upon the sides of the inferior fundus, and terminates in the hypogastric veins. The lymphatic vessels are, for the most part, situated between the mus- cular and the peritoneal coats, and terminate in the hypogastric lymphatic glands. The nerves are derived from the hypogastric plexus, which is composed both of ganglionic and spinal nerves ; and hence the bladder is partly subject to and partly beyond the influence of the will. Developement. The bladder of the foetus is remarkable for the predominance of its vertical over its transverse diameters, the latter being very short. This fact, added to the imperfect developement of the pelvis, explains why the entire bladder projects above the brim of the pelvis at this period of life. The inferior fundus does not exist. The summit is gradually continued into the urachus, which is then much larger than at subsequent periods, and of which the bladder appears to be merely an expansion. According to some authors, the bladder is relatively larger, and, according to others, smaller before than after birth. In the early periods of infancy the bladder retains the characters which it had in the foetus, and many important surgical inferences may, therefore, be drawn from its more extensive relations with the abdominal parietes. In proportion as the pelvis is developed, and, also, perhaps, in proportion as the * [This and all the other portions of the gcnito-urinary mucous membrane have an epithe- lium, which approaches to the columnar in character.]592 SPLANCHNOLOGY. frequently accumulated urine dilates the bladder in its transverse and antero- posterior diameters, this organ sinks into the pelvic cavity, and when com- pletely developed, presents the characters already assigned to it. The uraclms, which, we have seen, is converted into a muscular cord in the adult, and is sometimes lost before reaching the umbilicus, is much more de- veloped in the foetus: it may thfen be traced as far as the umbilicus, and even, according to some anatomists, through the whole extent of the umbilical cord! Analogy and some observations upon the human subject would seem to show that the urachus is hoUow in the foetus. In the lower animals the cavity of the urachus may be traced into a bag called the allantois, which is situated between the membranes of the ovum ; and it is stated by several authors, that they have caused mercury, injected into the bladder, to pass some distance (half an inch, one inch, or one inch and a half) into the urachus, and even for a greater or less extent into the umbilical cord. Moreover, in new-born infants, and even in adults, the urine has been seen to escape through the umbilicus ; but in these cases the urethra is always ob- literated. I have already said that I have met with a calculous concretion within the substance of the urachus, and I find that Haller and Harder have made a similar observation (arenulce in uracho visce). M. Boyer ( Traite (TAna- tomic, p. 477., Splanchnologib) says, that he has dissected the bladder of a man, twenty-six years of age, whose urachus formed a canal an inch and a half long, and contained twelve urinary calculi, as large as miUet seeds ; one of them was larger, and resembled a grain of barley. He convinced himself that the canal which contained these calculi was not formed by a prolongation of the internal membrane of the bladder through the other coats. On the other hand, a number of observers (myself among them) have found the urachus solid in the foetus. New facts are, therefore, necessary to settle this anatomical question ; although it is very probable that the urachus of the human subject is of the same nature as that of animals, but becomes obliterated at a much earlier period. Functions. The bladder is intended as a reservoir for the urine, and is also the principal agent in its expulsion. The urine constantly trickles drop by drop into the bladder, but cannot flow back by the ureters on account of the mechanism already described. When the bladder is distended it occasions a desire to evacuate its contents, and the urine is then eSpelled by the com- bined action of the bladder itself and the abdominal muscles. I have said that the bladder is the chief agent in this expulsion, for in cases of retention of urine from paralysis, or excessive distension of the bladder, the most powerful contractions of the abdominal muscles are not sufficient to expel it. The Suprarenal Capsules. The suprarenal capsules (c c,fig. 199.) are organs whose use is unknown ; they are situated near the upper end of the kidneys, and, like them, are outside the peritoneum. The proximity of the kidneys and suprarenal capsules has led to the sup- position, that there is some mutual relation between their functions; and hence they are generally described together, though not on perfectly just grounds.* The name renes succenturiati {Casserius) is sufficient evidence of the relation which has been supposed to exist between these organs. Never- theless, this connection of situation, which constitutes the most important and characteristic feature in the history of the suprarenal capsules is not con- stant ; and in the numerous cases in which the kidneys occupy some unusual position, the suprarenal capsules do not accompany those organs m their displacement. Thus, when the kidneys are situated higher than usual, the capsules are placed on their inner side, and correspond with the renal fissure; » Rustachius, who first described them, called them^tonrfuis qua renibus incumbunt.593 SUPRARENAL CAPSULES. when the kidneys occupy the pelvic region, the capsules undergo not the slightest change in their position, and no longer have any connection with ^^^iviimber. There are two suprarenal capsules: it is said that two have been found on each side. , Size They vary much in size in different individuals : sometimes they are so smaU that they can scarcely be distinguished from the fat by which the kidney is surrounded; at other times they are very large. In a case where the two kidneys were very smaU, I found the suprarenal capsules much larger than usual. It has been said that they are larger in the negro than in the Caucasian race. I have examined two negroes, and did not find them un- usually large. In the fcetus they are proportionally larger than in the adult. I have found them very large in several females far advanced in years. The two capsules are not of the same size. Eustachius affirms that the right is larger than the left; but I have generally found the reverse. Their weight is about one drachm. Form. I shall follow the example of M. Boyer, in comparing these supra- renal capsules to a helmet, flattened on its anterior and posterior surfaces, and embracing the upper end of the kidney by a narrow and concave surface. The relations of its anterior surface are different on the right and the left side. On the right side it is in relation with the liver, to which it adheres by a tolerably dense cellular tissue, so that the capsule is always removed in con- nection with that organ. This relation between the liver and the capsule is much more constant and intimate than that between the capsule and the kidney. A small depression, already described as existing on the lower sur- face of the liver, to the right of the vena cava ascendens, is intended for the reception of the capsule. On the left side the capsule is in immediate relation with the pancreas, and is indirectly connected with the spleen and the great end of the stomach. The posterior surface is in contact with the highest part of the pillars of the diaphragm, opposite the tenth dorsal vertebra. The great splanchnic nerves and the semilunar ganglia are situated behind, and on the inner side of the capsules, to which they send off so many branches, that Duvemoy regarded these organs as the ganglia of the renal nerves. Their convex, thin, and slightly sinuous border is directed inwards and up- wards. Their concave border is thick, and almost always deeply grooved. The surface of the capsules is invested by a thin layer of fat, which it is ex- tremely difficult to remove, on account of the numerous fibrous and vascular prolongations that pass into it from the capsule; certain furrows, either con- taining vessels or not, and varying in depth and extent, traverse the surface of this organ, especially in front. Cavity. It is still doubtful whether the suprarenal capsules have a cavity in their interior, as their name would seem to indicate. It is certain that in the gi-eater number of subjects, on dividing them in different directions, they are found to consist of two laminffi applied to each other, and united as by an adhesive substance, a sort of dark-coloured, false membrane; and that these laminEB are reflected inwards opposite the concave border, so as to form a projection like a cock's comb in the interior of the capsule. The colour of the external surface is yellowish, or rather mottled with large yellow and brown spots. The internal surface, or rather of the parts which are in contact, is chestnut brown, or bistre colour of different shades, so that I am induced to compare its appearance with that of an apoplectic cyst. It seems as if in this, as in the other case, blood had been effused, and then absorbed. The internal surface is also rough, and as it were lacerated ; a sort of yel- lowish, or chestnut-coloured pulp may be scraped off it. I have seen roundish, pulpy vegetations springing from several parts of this surface, sections of which presented a yellowish colour, mottled with brown. VOL. I. Q Q594 SPLANCHNOLOGY. The name of alrabiliary capsules, given to them by Bartholin, is undoubt- edly derived from the deep brown colour of their internal surface. That anatomist regarded them as small pouches or capsules, and thought that they were the reservoirs of the blackish fluid (sanguis niger, ^arCAoZzn; succus atrabiliaris, atramentum glandulosum, Lecat.), to which the ancients gave the name of atrabilis. Structure. The suprarenal capsules consist of two substances: one ex- ternal or cortical, yellowish, and striated, which forms almost the whole thick- ness of the capsule; and an internal or central portion, presenting the ap- pearance of a soft layer of a deep chestnut brown colour, and traversed by numerous vessels. The striated arrangement of the cortical layer, which is so easily seen in large animals, is frequently effaced in the human subject, where the capsule appears reduced to a thin yellowish lamella, folded back upon itself. The lobular character of the surface is only apparent, and de- pends upon the furrows formed in it for the vessels. The granular structure, admitted by most of the authors who have called these organs glands, has not been clearly demonstrated. A fibrous membrane, analogous to the proper coat of the kidney, covers the suprarenal capsules. The capsular arteries are very numerous and very large, in proportion to the size of the organ ; they are divided into the superior, arising from the phrenic, the middle, proceeding directly from the aorta, and the inferior, furnished by the renal arteries. The veins are very large, and soon pass into the vena cava; the anterior furrow is chiefly intended for them. It has been supposed that they open directly into the cavity of the capsule, on account of the facUity with which this latter may be distended by injecting air or any fluid into the veins. But it is probable that in such cases laceration has occurred. The veins of the right capsule enter the vena cava inferior directly ; those of the left enter the renal vein of the same side. The lymphatic vessels are little known. The are very numerous ; they are derived directly from the semilunar ganglia and solar plexus, and also from the renal plexus. It is in vain to search for the excretory duct, admitted by several anatomists; and de- scribed by some as entering the pelvis of the kidney, and by others as ter- minating in the testicle in the male, and in the ovary in the female. Developement. The suprarenal capsules are relatively much larger in the foetus than in the adult, and they are remarkable in this respect, that their size is inversely proportioned to that of the kidneys. They are distinct as early as the second month of intra-uterine life, and at that time exceed the kidney both in weight and size. This predominance continues during the whole of the third month; at the fourth, the kidneys and the suprarenal capsules are of equal size ; at the sixth month, the capsules are not more than half as large as the kidneys ; at birth, not more than one-third. The existence of a cavity is not more evident in the foetus than in the adult. In the aged, the suprarenal capsules are sometimes very large, and their colour is always yellow at this period of life. Uses. The uses of the suprarenal capsules are unknown ; we are even ig- norant whether they should be classed among the glands. The great number of vessels with which they are supplied, and the numerous nerves distributed upon them, sufiiciently prove that something more than mere nutritive changes must occur within these organs. Their pathological anatomy, which still re- mains to be investigated, may perhaps throw some light upon this obscure point of physiology.595 Q Q 2 THE GENERATIVE ORGANS. The eenerative apparatus presents this remarkable peculiarity, that the organs ?whTchTtis comjosed are divided between two individuals of the same spe- cies • and from this division results the difference of sex. The male sex is chiefly characterised by the faculty of producing a fecun- dating fluid, the sperviatic fluid, or semen. The female sex is characterised by the faculty oi producing certain ovules, which become fitted for the reproduction of an individual of the same species, as soon as they have been submitted to the fecundating influence of the fluid secreted by the male. The female sex is also characterised, in the human species, and m aU mammaha, by the pos- session of a gland (the mamma), which is intended to provide nutriment tor the newly born creature. . The genital organs occupy the lower extremity of the trunk ; they are situ- ated in contact with the termination of the digestive canal on the one hand, and of the urinary organs on the other, with the latter of which they have the most intimate connections, especially in the male. THE GENERATIVE ORGANS OF THE MALE. The Testicles and their coverings.—The Epididymis, the Vasa Deferentia, and Vesiculce Seminales.—The Penis.—The Urethra.—The Prostate and Cow- per's Glands. The genital organs of the male consist of a secreting and an excretory appa- ratus, composed of the following parts :—two glands, called the testicles; two provisional excretory canals, the vasa deferentia; two reservoirs for the sper- matic fluid during the longer or shorter intervals between the periods of its expulsion, named the vesiculce seminales; and certain ultimate excretory canals, the ejaculatory ducts and the urethra. To this latter canal is annexed an erec- tile structure, which enables it to assume the condition necessary for the ejec- tion of the fecundating fluid; together, they form the penis. The prostate gland and Cowper's glands yield secretions, the use of which is connected with the generative functions : they may be regarded as appendages of the urethra. The Testicles and their Coverings. The Coverings of the Testicle. The coverings of the testicle consist of several layers; which, reckoning from without inwards, are the scrotum, the dartos, the tunica erythroides, the fibrous coat, and the tunica vaginalis. There is a sixth testicular covering, named the tunica albuginea; but, as it forms an integral part of the testis, we shall describe it with that organ. The scrotum*, or cutaneous covering of the testicles, is a sort of pouch or bag common to both of those organs; the skin of which it is composed exhibits the following peculiarities. It is of a browner colour than that of other parts of the body, so that in some individuals a layer of colouring matter, similar to that existing in the negro, may be demonstrated beneath it; like the skin of the penis and the eyelids, it is very thin, on account of the tenuity of its chorion; it is much larger * From the Latin word scrotum, a sac, or purse of leather. The Greek term for the same part is SfxiDv, and hence the vrord oscheocele, which serves to designate every tumour developed \n the scrotum.SPLANCHNOLOGY, 596 than IS needed for containing the testicle; it is provided with scattered and obhquely inserted hairs, the foUicles of which are large, and project upon the surface ; and, lastly, its external aspect presents many varieties : thus, it be- comes flaccid and elongated under the influence of warmth, and in old and enfeebled persons, while during youth, in the robust, and under the influence of cold, it becomes contracted, wrinkled, and closely applied to the testicle. The scrotum is divided into two equal halves, by a sort of median line or ridge, called the raphe, from the Greek word ^dtrTw, to sew; because the two halves of the skin appear to be united at this part, as it were by a seam. The object of the great extent of the skin of the scrotum is, perhaps, to en- able it to cover the penis when in a state of erection. The dartus is a reddish filamentous tissue, traversed by a great number of vessels, which can be easily seen through the skin of the scrotum. This tissue envelopes both testicles, and furnishes a prolongation interposed between them, and forming the septum of the dartos. Upon the sides, and opposite the sper- matic cord, the dartos terminates abruptly, and is replaced by adipose cellular tissue. In front, it is continued around the penis ; behind, it is prolonged upon the median line, by an angvdar extremity, as far as the sphincter ani. It follows, therefore, that there is only a single dartos, within which are contained both testicles, a septum alone intervening between them. This se- paration in the middle line has led some to follow Ruysch, in describing a distinct dartos for each testicle. The dartos is closely united to the skin of the scrotum by its external surface, and it is very loosely connected by extremely delicate cellular tissue, with the subjacent coverings, upon which it glides with the greatest freedom. With regard to its structure, the dartos at first sight presents some analogy to cellular tissue, but it differs from it essentially in its aspect; for in no situ- ation does cellular tissue exhibit distinct reddish nodulated filaments, like those of the dartos. It is true that these filaments are irregularly interlaced, but the majority of them pass in a vertical direction; and when a single fibre is ex- amined, we are struck with its analogy to muscular tissue.* It also differs in its vital properties : thus, the dartos possesses the property of active contrac- tility, as is seen in the contraction of the scrotum, and the vermicular motions observed in persons exposed to cold, or under the influence of great dread, or of the venereal orgasm, and also in the much more evident contraction of the scrotum after an irritating injection has been thrown into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis. It is, therefore, intermediate between cellular and muscular tissue, and might be called the dartoid tissue. It was for a long time supposed to be confined to the scrotum, but it is met with in many other parts, viz. the vagina, the sub- stance of the nipple, and the parietes of the veins, of which it seems to me to form the external coat. Some anatomists regard the dartos as nothing more than the remains of the gubernaculum testis; but, in the first place, the dartos is found in the foetus, before the descent of the testicle ; and in an adult, whose testicle had not es- caped from the external abdominal ring, I satisfied myself that the gubernaculum and the dartos existed separately and independently of each other.f The dartos has also been incorrectly regarded as a continuation of the su- perficial fascia (see Aponeurology). The tunica erythroides. This name (derived from the Greek word ipvOphs, red) is given to a thin membrane, formed by an expansion of the fibres of the * [According to M. Jordan {MUUer's Archives, 1834), tlie tissue of the dartos is composed of uniform 'cylindrical filaments, which resemble those of cellular tissue in diameter, but are larcer than the varicose filaments of voluntary muscular fibre, and smaller than the uivoluntary muscular fibres, excepting those compo.sing the iris. They resemble cellular tissue, and not muscle in their chemical characters, and differ from the former only m presenting a reddish aspect and in being arranged into longitudinal fasciculi, instead of intcrl.acmg m all directions.] t The specimen from which this statement is taken has been presented to the anatomical society by M. IVlanec.597 THE TESTICLES. Q Q 3 cremaster. It is very well marked in the young and vigorous, but becomes partially atrophied in the aged* . . n .i, wi. We have already seen (vide Obliquus interims abdominis. Myology) that the cremaster is essentiaUy formed of fibres arising directly from the groove of the crural arch, on the outer side of the inguinal canal. The loops formed by the lower portions of the obliquus internus and transversalis are, where they exist, completely distinct from it. The cremaster and the tunica erythroides, which is an expansion of it, are the agents of the sudden upward movement of the testicle, which is very distinct from the slow vermicular motion resulting from the action of the dartos. In a patient whose urethra was extremely irritable, I found that the introduction of a bougie was followed by a sudden and long- continued elevation of the testicles, with a separation of their lower ends. This movement was entirely independent of the dartos and scrotum, which re- mained flaccid and pendent in front of the thighs. When the cremaster reaches the testicles, it expands into a number of fas- ciculi, distributed over the surface of the fibrous coat, and inserted, in the lower animals, by well marked tendinous fibres, which, however, I have never been able to discover in man. In hydrocele, these fibrous bundles resemble small cords, which, as Sir A. Cooper judiciously remarks, may be mistaken for veins. The common fibrous coat. This membrane is very distinct from the tunica vaginalis, which lines its inner surface ; it forms a common covering for the testicle and the spermatic cord; it is thin and transparent, narrow along the cord, and expanded below, so as to cover the testicle. At the inguinal ring it divides into two laminae ; one of which, almost always incomplete, is attached to the circumference of the ring, whilst the other seems to be prolonged within the canal, where it is, however, very difficult to follow it. Modern anatomists regard this fibrous tunic as a prolongation of the fascia transversalis, which would be dragged down with the testicle during its descent. The tunica vaginalis, or serous coat. The tunica vaginalis is a shut sac, and presents two portions; one, parietal (p, fig. 183.), lining the fibrous coat, the other, reflected or testicular (y), which covers the testicle, without that organ being contained within the sac. The intimate union of the serous and fibrous coats of the testicle affords an example of a fibro-serous membrane, analogous to the dura mater and the pe- ricardium. As the refiection of the tunica vaginalis upon the testicle takes place at a variable height, it follows that a greater or less portion of the cord is covered by this coat. The arrangement of the tunica vaginalis on one side of the epididymis differs from that on the other. On the outer side it immediately invests the epididy- mis, is then reflected from it, becoming applied to the part reflected from the opposite side of the epididymis, and forms a cul-de-sac, by which the middle of that body is completely separated from the upper border of the testicle. At the bottom of this cul-de-sac are some small openings, leading into a back cavity. It forms, therefore, a fold like the mesentery, at the middle of the epididymis, the two ends of which, however, are closely applied to the testicle. On the inner side it rises higher upon the cord than on the outer side, and is separated from the epididymis by the vas deferens and the spermatic vessels. It is easy to detach it from the fibrous coat, where it is reflected upon the testicle, but it adheres closely to the epididymis and to the tunica albuginea. Its internal surface, free and smooth, exhales a serous fluid, the morbid ac- cumulation of which constitutes the disease called hydrocele. In most animals the tunica vaginalis communicates with the peritoneum at all ages ; but in man this communication exists normally, only during intra-uterine life. Afterbirth the two cavities are perfectly distinct. If, from any cause, this separation is not completed, the tunica vaginalis may form either a hernial sac, containing * J-^u ;? extremely well developed in the stallion ; in which animal it is easy to establish the distinct.on between this muscle and the lower libves of the internal ob iouc the loops ol which do not exist in all subjects.

The testicles (testes) are two glandular organs, intended to secrete the sper- matic fluid. They are situated in the scrotum, at the sides of and below the penis, and are therefore exposed to external violence. They are supported by their coverings, and by the cord formed by the spermatic vessels, and are at a greater or less distance from the inguinal ring, according as the dartos and cremaster are in a state of relaxation or contraction. The testicles are not situated at exactly the same height, the left descending a little lower than the right. This arrangement, which has not escaped the observation of painters and sculptors, assists in protecting them from injury by enabling them to glide one above the other when the thighs are closely ap- proximated, and thus to avoid compression. Their situation is not the same at all periods of life. In the foetus, they are contained within the abdominal cavity. Sometimes they remain permanently, or much longer than usual in that situation, which, in the natural state, is merely temporary. Number. The varieties in the number of the testicles are most of them only apparent. Thus, for example, in almost all monorchides (persons having but one testis ; from ix6vos, single, and Spx'y, a testicle), that testicle which is absent from the scrotum is situated in the abdomen. Nevertheless, I have had occa- sion to dissect an individual who had only one testicle ; there was an atrophied vesicula seminalis on the side where the testicle was wanting; the vas de- ferens commenced at this vesicle, and was lost upon the side of the bladder. I was not able to examine the spermatic vessels. The examples of three, four, or five testicles are not well attested. * An epiploic, or fatty tumour, or a cyst, may have been mistaken for a testicle. Size. The testicles vary in size in diflferent individuals, and still more at different ages. At the period of puberty, the testicle, which up to that time had been as it were in a state of atrophy in comparison with the rest of the body, increases greatly in size. This atrophy, which is normal before puberty, may continue to a more advanced age. In a subject about twenty years of age, in which the penis and lai'ynx were highly developed, I found the two testicles atrophied: they weighed less than a drachm ; the epididymis, although it was atrophied, was larger than the body of the testicle. The two testicles are not exactly of the same size ; the left is generally larger than the right; but this difference is so slight and inconstant, that some anatomists have even thought that a slight predominance may be observed in the right. The following are the average dimensions of the testicle: — length, two inches ; breadth, one inch ; thickness, eight lines. Weight. According to Meckel, the weight of the testicle is four drachms; according to Sir Astley Cooper, one ounce. Consistence. It is extremely important, especially in a practical point of view, to judge of the natural consistence of the testicle. The character of this consistence is determined less by the proper substance of the testicle than by the degree of tension of its immediate covering ; and in this respect the con- sistence of the testicle very much resembles that of the eye. In the aged, the seminiferous ducts being empty, the testicle becomes soft, and, as it were, atrophied. It would be still less consistent, if it were not for the serous fluid with which the cellular tissue between these ducts becomes infiltrated. Figure, direction, and relations. The testicle is oval, but flattened at the sides. This form, added to the polished and slippery character of its surface, * I have been consulted concerning a child, wlio appeared to me to have two testicles upon one side, each of which was as large as that of the opposite side ; but it is impossible to decide with certainty upon such a matter until dissection has shown the true nature of pretended supernumerary testicles. Nevertheless, the kind of pain felt upon pressing the body imagmed to be a testicle may aftbrd tolerably satisfactory indications during life.THE TESTICLES. 599 « Q 4 enables it easily to avoid compression.

When the tunica al- buginea is carefully removed, filaments of the glandular Fig, 183. » //,, substance are seen escaping from these small ceUs, which are most numerous at the upper borders of the testicle. The strength of the vascular filaments which traverse the testicle, has led to the opinion that they are all en- veloped by a fibrous sheath derived from the tunica albu- ginea, but I have never been satisfied of the existence of these sheaths. | At the upper border of the testicle, the tunica albu- ginea becomes remarkably thickened, and forms the corpus Highmori, or mediastinum testis (^Cooper). In order to obtain a correct notion of this structure, it is necessary to make a vertical section of the testicle, at right angles with its long diameter: we then observe a nucleus (i, Jig. 183.), or fibrous thickening of a triangular shape, per- forated by bloodvessels, but do not at first sight discover any canals in it; so that we might be inclined to agree with Winslow (who » [M. Cruveilhicr differs from most other anatomists in applying the terms upper and lower to the opposite borders of the testicle, instead of posterior and anterior ; on the contrary, he de- scribes the two extretnitics of this organ as anterior and posterior, instead of upper and lower, as Is usuiilly the case.] t The existence Of numerous vessels within the substance of the tunica albuginea has led Sir Astley Cooper to describe two layers in it; — an external, which he compared to the dura mater, and an internal (the tunica vasculosa), which he likened to the pia mater. I cannot admit this analogy. The vessels contained in the tunica albuginea rather resemble the sinuses of the dura mater than the vascular network of the pia mater. t See note, p. 560.600 SPLANCHNOLOGY. Fig. 184. called it the nucleus of the testis) in denying that it contains any canals; or rather with Swammerdam, in regarding those canals that do exist in it, as destined exclusively for the arteries and veins. If, after dividing the testicle along its convex border, we reflect the tunica albuginea, we shall see that near the upper border the filaments (a a,fiq. 184 ) which constitute the substance of the testicle enter (6 b) numerous spaces existing in the tunica albuginea at this part, pass towards the thickening (i) ot the upper border, traverse it (c) from its posterior to its anterior extremity and then uniting together into a greater or less number of tubes, perforate (d) the tunica albuginea opposite the head of the epididymis (e). The corpus Highmorianum, moreover, exists only in the anterior half of the upper border of the testicle (see i.fig. 184.). All the bloodvessels reach the testicle at this point, and having entered it there, divide into two sets ; one of these is situated in the substance of the fibrous coat, so as to form its sinuses (the tunica vasculosa), and furnishes a multitude of vessels, which are given off from it in succession, and are distributed to the substance of the gland.* Among these vessels, I would particularly notice one tortuous artery which passes from before backwards along the upper border of the testicle. The other set of vessels perforate the corpus Highmorianum directly, and pass from the upper to the lower border of the testicle. The corpus High- morianum then is a thickening of the tunica albuginea, which occupies the anterior half of the upper border of the testicle, and is perforated by the filaments composing the proper tissue of the testicle, and also by a great num- ber of bloodvessels. Proper tissue. The proper substance of the testicle resembles a soft yel- lowish pulp, grooved by a multitude of small tense and strong columns, which divide it into a great number of masses or lobules (a a. Jig. 184.). These small columns are nothing more than the vessels given off from the tunica albuginea.f Each lobule represents a pyramid, the apex of which is directed towards the upper border of the gland, and the base towards its lower border. The lobules consist of a collection of extremely delicate fi^laments, folded a very great number of times upon them- selves, so as to resemble the granules of glands, and have in fact been described as such by some anat- omists.J These filaments are the seminiferous tubes, which were injected by Haller and Monro from the vas deferens. I have in vain attempted to perform the same expeMment; the mercury never passed be- yond the epididymis. It has been said that each lobule is formed by one or two tubuli, and the number of these tubes has been calculated at 300. Each tubulus is said to be 16 feet long, and ^^th of an inch in diameter. According to Monro's calculation there would be 5000 feet of tubuli seminiferi in the small space occupied by one testicle. * [According to Sir Astley Cooper, many of the arterial vessels pass along the septa, extend- ing from the inner surface of the tunica albuginea to the mediastinum, and then turn bacli and are distributed upon the lobes. The principal veins arise upon the larger ends of the lobes, pass up to the mediastinum, and perforate it.] t [Sir Astley Cooper has described fibrous columns which extend from the inner surface of the tunica albuginea, and unite with similar prolongations given off from the mediastinum testis, and forming the sides of the cells described by M. Cruveilhier (p. 599.). From these columns lateral membranes proceed, so as to form septa between the larger masses of glandular structure, whilst other finer membranous extensions enclose the small lobes in separate pouches. The larger bloodvessels are supported by the columns, and the smaller ones ramify upon the membranous septa and pouches.] , t Riolanus described a fibrous thickening of the proper coat of the testicle. The description given by Highmore is very confused ; he describes a hody obscure aut omntnd non cavum, which appears to perforate the tunica albuginea, and to convey the semen to the epididymis : he has also represented as opening into this canal certain parallel vessels, which he considered to be an artery and a vein.THE TESTICLES. 601 If we take hold of the suhstauce of the testicle with a pair of pincers, and then draw it out slowly, we shall raise a number of apparently knotted ma- ments from the common mass ; some of which wiU break immediately, whilst 0 hers may be drawn out to a foot, a foot and a half or two feet, without breakm^ 1 is particularly easy to pull out the filaments when the tissue of the tes icle is very mS The littfe knots disappear dm-ing this process andthe tubuli then assume the character of straight and almost transparent filaments The proper tissue of the testicle adheres to the tunica albuginea by the blood- vessels only, excepting near the upper border of the I"^*'!

The testicular artery, the principal division ot the spermatic, divides before entering the testis into several branches, which pass into the tunica albuginea along the upper border of the gland, and are dis- tributed, as I have already pointed out when speaking of the corpus Highmon. The veins are very numerous, are arranged in an analogous manner, and form the spermatic veins. The lymphatics are very numerous, and are divided into the superficial and deep. The nerves are derived both from the ganglionic and the cerebro-spinal system. They have not been traced into the interior of the testicle, and yet the sensibility of that organ is suflicient evidence of their existence there._ The serous cellular tissue, by which the seminiferous ducts are united, is so delicate, that it can only be shown by the aid of a very favourable light. The Epididymis. The epididymis (e.f,figs. 184, 185.) is the vermiform appendage which lies along the superior border of the testicle, like the crest upon a helmet. Its name is derived from its position (eTrl, upon, SiSu/ios, the testicle). It is so situated that it does not precisely occupy the superior border of the testicle, but encroaches a little upon its outer face (see ^^.18^>, a section of the ' U • right testis), so that when the tunica vaginalis is opened, and the inner side of the testicle examined, we cannot see the epididymis. It is closely connected with the testicle by its anterior extremity, which is remarkably enlarged, and is called the head, or globus major (e); its middle portion or body (_/") is separated from the testis ; and it again adheres by its posterior extremity, called the tail, or globus minor (g); which, after being prolonged as far as the posterior ex- tremity of the testis, turns upwards, by being reflected upon itself, and gives origin to the vas deferens (i). It is flattened from above downwards, concave below, and slightly flexuous; its two extremities are covered by the tunica vaginalis only above and on the outside, but its body is completely enclosed by that membrane, which forms a fold for it like the mesentery. (See Tunica Vaginalis.) * [The seminiferous tubes are of the same diameter throughout. According to Lauth, they most commonly terminate in loops, and by numerous anastomoses ; in one instance only did he observe a free clnsed extremity. In some animals, Miiller found the seminal tubes ending in free extremities ; and the same mode of termination was frequently seen by Krause in the human testis. Like the uriniferous tubes, the tubuli seminiferi termmate, therefore, in two ways.] t [Immediately before the tubuli pass into the corpus Highmori to form the rete, they become rather l.irger and straight, and are hence called the tubuli recti (dd. Jig. 184.) : the tubuli com- posing the rete are stated by Lauth to vary from seven to thirteen j they are tortuous, and, as supposed by Haller, anastomose.]602 Structure. SPLANCHNOLOGY. When the tunica vaginalis, which gives the epididymis a smooth appearance, is removed (as in fig. 185.), the latter resem- bles a cord, so twisted upon itself' that it would appear impossible at first sight to disentangle it. This cord is hollow, as may be shown by injecting mercury or a co- loured liquid into it through the vas deferens. The canal or duct which forms the epididymis is not unfrequently found distended with semen ; and then we may ascertain by simple inspection, as well as by injecting it, that it is of a determinate size, and that its parietes- are thin and semi-transparent. The epididymis is intimately connected with the body of the testicle by its head only; the other means of at- tachment between the two parts consisting exclusively of rather dense cellular tissue and a fold of the tunica vaginalis. The head of the epididymis is united to the testicle by several ducts, the number of which varies from ten to thirty. They form several groups, which emerge from the the corpus Highmori, and immediately afterwards become convoluted, so as to form the head or globus major of the epididymis. These vessels, which are called the vasa efferentia, or coni vasculosi (d), are per- fectly distinct at their exit from the corpus Highmori; but after a short course in the globus major, they unite into a single canal, the numerous convolutions of which constitute the vermi- form body called the epididymis. It is possible, by careful and minute dissec- tion, to unravel this duct, the folds of which, shaped like the figure 8, are united by very dense cellular tissue. Monro, who even counted the nimiber of its inflections, has calculated its length to be about thirty-two feet.* It is supplied with arteries, and some veins and numerous lymphatics issue from it. Its nerves are derived from the testicular, and accompany a small branch of the hypogastric artery, which has been named the deferential artery by Sir Astley Cooper. Not unfrequently a dense cord, having the same structure as the vas deferens, is found proceeding from the epididymis; this cord is the vas aberrans. (^Haller.) The supernumerary ducts of this nature, injected with mercury by Haller, extended for a few inches into the cellular tissue of the spermatic cord. The Vas Deferens. The vas deferens (t,figs. 181. 184—186.), the excretory duct of the tes- ticle, extends from the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct {fig. 186.), which may be regarded as a continuation of it. It commences at the point where the caudal extremity of the epididymis becomes separated from the testicle. The following is a description of its very complicated course. In its first or testicular portion it passes from behind forwards and upwards along the upper border of the testicle, almost parallel with the epididymis, from the inner edge of which it is separated only by the spermatic arteries and veins. In this first portion of its course, the vas deferens pretty closely resembles a braided cord, and is, moreover, folded a great number of times, like the canal of the epididymis. The second., funicular or ascending, portion of the vas deferens forms part * [The average length of the vasa efferentia is stated by Lauth to be eight inches ; they diminish in size as they approach the canal forming the epididymis, which they enter at inter- vals of about three and a quarter inches from each other. The length of tliat canal is, accord- ing to the same author, about twenty-one feet.]THE TESTICLES. ^03 of the sDermatic cord, and passes directly upwards towards the inguinal ring. ?heie it is if reSn with the spermatic artery and vems, which are placed ;n V n.t if -ind from which it is perfectly distinct, being surrounded by an Indt e^Jdl^'sWromoJ^'ntous cellular tLue^ It ;-oW^^^^^^^^ mrt for the sDace of an inch or an inch and a halt, but is stiaigm m me icm, ^f"i stJet^ThVtMrd or inguinal portion of the vas deft^rens^p^ses ^rougb the in<niinal canal to enter into the abdomen.

Having arrived opposite and internaUy to the entrance of the ureter into he bladder, it is directed horizontaUy inwards and a httle forwards hke the vesicula seminalis (s, figs. 181. 186.), internally to which it is situated, and graduaUy approaches nearer and nearer to its fellow of the opposite side, with which it seems to be joined. At the anterior extremity of the vesicda semi- nalis, it unites at an acute angle with the efferent duct (c, fig. 186.) of the latter, the union of the two forming the ejaculaiory duct (d). In its vesical portion, for about two inches above the vesiculse seminales, the vas deferens is con- siderably dilated, and at the same time its parietes become thinner. On the inner side of the vesicula seminalis the canal still continues dilated, and is sometimes sacculated, and has a flexuous appearance. Each sacculus is formed by a small ampulla, which opens into the cavity of the canal. The vas deferens forms, therefore, in this situation, a sort of provisional reservoir, resembling in its internal aspect and structure the vesiculse semi- nales. The spermatic cord, or cord of the spermatic vessels, is formed by the sper- matic artery * and veins, the lymphatic vessels, the spei-matic plexus of nerves, a branch of the genito-crural nerve, and the vas deferens, all being surrounded by the cremaster muscle and the common fibrous coat. Structure. The following are the principal points concerning the structure of the vas deferens. It is harder than any other excretory duct, and it can be recognised by the touch among the other constituent parts of the cord, both in the healthy and in the diseased state, in which latter condition it may become considerably enlarged. It is perfectly cylindrical. Its bore is so small that it is almost capillary, and will scarcely admit Mejan's probe. Its parietes are thick, and contrast singularly with the fineness of its bore. Several anatomists admit the existence of circular and longitudinal muscular fibres in this duct. Leuwenhoek demonstrated longitudinal fibres, with circular fibres beneath them. All that I have been able to discover in the human vas deferens, even by the aid of the glass, are circular. In their appearance, and kind of cohesion, they present much analogy to muscular fibres; but it is in the larger animals only, in the horse for example, that their muscularity can be clearly ascertained, and that we find distinctly a very thin longitudinal and superficial layer of fibres, with very thick and strong circular fibres beneath. The internal surface of the vas deferens is white, rough, and alveolar; its roughness is due to small and very white fibrous fasciculi, some of which are * [Also the deferential artery, and the cremaslLric branch of the epigastric artery.]SPLANCHNOLOGY. krlv o?il-r°!'i"^r"^' ^'•'^ which are either regu- lany or irregularly arranged. ^ to dc^momme l?^'^^'''"'^ ^^'^ '''' ^ef^'^™^ is «° thin that it is difficult The Vesicula Seminales. The vesiculee seminales are two membranous pouches, which serve as re- servoirs for the semen.* They are situated (s,fg. 181.) between the rectum and the bladder, on the outer p. side of, and parallel to, the vasa deferentia. As ^ 'S- they are directed obliquely inwards and for- wards (.s, fig. 186.), their anterior extremities are closely approximated, being separated from each other merely by the width of the vasa de- ferentia, while their posterior extremities are very far asunder; they thus form two sides of an isosceles triangle, within the area of which the bladder (a) is in immediate relation with the rectum. They are flattened and oblong, and are expanded at their posterior extremities, which sometimes project beyond the inferior fxmdus of the distended bladder, and always do so when that organ is contracted. Their ante- rior extremities are narrowed, and surrounded by the prostate, and their surface has a sac- culated appearance. They vary in size, which is not always equal on the two sides ; and they are much larger in the adult than in youth or old age. Their size also varies according to whether they are empty or full. They are from two inches to two inches and a half long, and about six lines broad, and two or three lines thick. Their relations with the bladder and the rectum are not direct; for they are surrounded with a filamentous tissue, consisting of transverse fibres, which separates them from the neighbouring parts, and appears to me to be analogous to the tissue of the dartos. When divided in various directions, the vesiculae seminales exhibit a col- lection of cells, communicating with each other, and filled with a yellowish brown, thick, viscid fluid, very different in appearance from semen as ejaculated during life. The sacculi of the external suflface, and the cells and septa of the interior of the vesiculaj, are formed by the extremely complicated convolution of a sort of intestinal tube, or narrow oblong sac, on which I have never been able to find any appendages, ramifications, or diverticula. When imravelled (as at s), its length varies from six to eight inches; its convolutions are attached to each other by fibrous tissue, but they may always be separated, either with or without maceration. I have seen an unfolded vesicle a foot in length; in other subjects I have seen two distinct pouches on each side, one of which was ex- tremely small. Lastly, the internal surface of the seminal vesicles has the same rough and alveolar appearance as that of the vasa deferentia. The structure of the parietes of the vesicles is also precisely the same as * [The semen, considered anatomically, consists, according to Wagner, of/(7«o) sc7Hi'«i.s, .sc- minal granules, and seminal animalcules; the latter were discovered by Ham, and described by Leuwenhoek. In the human subject, the seminal granules are round granulated bodies, about ^^th to ji^th of an inch in diameter; the seminal animalcules, or spermatozoa, have an elliptical body, about g^th to f.jjjjth of an inch in diameter, and a long caudal filament: their total length is from Jjgth to ^^th of an inch : their organisation is yet unknown ; but in the spermatozoa of the bear, Valentin has lately observed evidences of a definite internal structure ; thev perform very rapid movements, which continue some hours after evacuation or removal from the bodv They are not found before puberty, and then only in the vesicula; seminales, vas deferens and epididymis.

The Penis. The penis, the organ of copulation, is situated in fi-ont of the symphysis pubis. When collapsed, it is flaccid, and forms a curve with the concavity lo9king downwards; but during erection, it is large and hard, and forms a curve with its concavity turned upwards. ... .., It is cylindrical when collapsed, but has a triangular prismatic form, with blunt edges, when in the opposite condition. Two of these edges are lateral, and are formed by the projection of the corpus cavemosum; the other is anterior, and corresponds with the canal of the urethra. Its posterior extremity is at- tached to the pubis ; its anterior extremity forms a conical enlargement, caUed the glans, on which is seen the orifice of the urethra. Structure. The penis consists essentially of the corpus cavemosum and the canal of the urethra, the expanded extremity of which forms the glans penis. Some proper muscles are attached to it; it receives large vessels and nerves, and it is covered by integument. The skin of the penis and prepiwe. The skin of the penis has several pecu- liarities : thus, it is very thin, although not so thin as that of the scrotum and the eyelids. In this respect it contrasts remarkably with the thick hairy skin which covers the cushion of adipose tissue situated over the symphysis ; it is generally of a browner colour than that of the rest of the skin ; it has no hair bulbs visible to the naked eye ; it is extremely moveable, being capable of gliding forward upon the corpus cavemosum, of forming a covering for tumours in the scrotum, and also of folding upon itself when the penis is reduced to its smallest dimensions. This great mobility of the skin is owing to the loose- ness of the subcutaneous cellular tissue, which is continuous with the dartos, and appears to me to be of the same nature ; like that structure, it never con- tains fat, but may become infiltrated with serum. The prepuce. The skin of the penis forms a non-adherent sheath for the glans, upon which it advances, and either projects beyond it or not, according as that part is flaccid or distended. At the free border of this sheath the skin does not terminate abruptly, but is reflected upon itself, assumes the cha- racters of mucous membrane, and passes backwards as far as the base of the glans, so as to line the inner surface of the cutaneous layer. Opposite the constriction or neck surrounding the glans, the mucous membrane or reflected skin again becomes reflected over the glans, to which it forms a closely ad- herent covering, and at the margin of the orifice of the urethra becomes con- tinuous with the mucous membrane lining that canal. The non-adherent sheath which covers the glans is called the prepuce.' * [Beneath the mucous membnine covering the constriction behinil the corona glandis, are situated clusters of small sebaceous glauda, named ^landuUe Tysoni, or odorifcra:.}SPLANCHNOLOGY.

Ihe term fraimm prmputii is applied to a triangular fold of mucous mem- brane, which IS reflected from the prepuce upon the furrow on the lower surface of the glans, below the urethral orifice. Sometimes the prolongation of the fricnum as far as the orifice renders erection painful, and requires a slight operation, called section of the frajnum. ^ The cellular tissue, between the cutaneous and mucous layers of the prepuce partakes of the characters of the subcutaneous cellular tissue of the penis - its looseness enables the prepuce to be unfolded, and this takes place more or less completely dunng erection. The corpus cavernosum. The corpus cavernosum, so named on account of Its structure, forms the greater portion of the penis : it commences behind by a bifurcated extremity, forming its roots, or crura. Each root arises immediately on the inside, and above the tuberosity of the ischium, by a vei7 slender extre- mity, a.nd gradually increasing in size, passes forwards and inwards along the ascending ramus of the ischium and the descending ramus of the pubes, to both of which it adheres intimately. At the symphysis the two roots unite. The triangular interval between them is occupied by the canal of the urethra. The corpus cavernosum results, therefore, from the union of two distinct conical roots ; and on this account the older anatomists distinguished two cor- pora cavernosa: but the communications existing between its two halves are opposed to any such distinction. The corpus cavernosum is cylindrical, and presents a longitudinal groove above, in which are lodged the dorsal vessels and nerves of the penis, and a broad and deep groove below, in which the urethra is situated. The anterior extremity is obtuse, and is embraced by the base of the glans, with which it does not appear to have any vascular communication. Structure. The corpus cavernosum is composed of a very strong fibrous cylinder, filled with a spongy or erectile tissue. The fibrous cylinder. The external coat is of a fibrous nature, and is re- markable for its thickness, which is one or two lines; for its strength, which is such that the corpus cavernosum will bear the whole weight of the body without breaking, as may be proved experimentally upon the dead body ; and for its extensibility and elasticity, properties which do not belong intrinsically to the tissue itself, but depend upon the areolar disposition of its fibres, f Septum of the corpus cavernosum. The interior of the cavernous body is di- vided into two lateral halves by an incomplete septum, formed of very strong vertical fibrous columns, which are much thicker and more numerous behind than in front This median septum (septum pectiniforme, b,fig. 187.), between the two halves of the corpus cavernosum, is not complete : it appears to be in- tended to prevent too great a distension of this part during erection. The spongy or erectile tissue. An areolar tissue (a a), the meshes of which contain a greater or less quantity of blood, occupies the interior of the fibrous cylinder of the corpus cavernosum. This tissue, which is the chief agent in erection, consists of an interlacement of veins, supported by prolongations or trabecules, given off from the inner surface of the fibrous membrane. » When this malformation exists, if the prepuce be drawn back over the base of the glans it cannot be returned ; this condition of the parts, and the sort of strangulation resulting from it, constitutes what is known by the name oipara-phymosis. t [The outer coat of the corpus cavernosum and the trabeculs, in its interior, consist of ten- dinous fibres, mixed with some elastic tissue. In the penis of the horse there arc pale red fibres, differing from cellular, tendinous, and elastic tissue, but which, according to Miiller, do not possess muscular contractility.]THE PENIS.

The veins of the corpus cavernosum a,re — extremely large, and are divided into the dorsal veins of the penis and the proper veins of the cavernous body ; they all pass beneath the symphysis, and are received into fibrous canals, through which they are transmitted into the pelvis. These veins are provided with a great number of valves, so that injections thrown into the trunks cannot pass into the branches. . , i. . .t. The arteries arise from the internal pudic, and enter the substance ot tne corpus cavernosum. Injection of these arteries does not produce erection until the fluid has passed from them into the veins.* The lymphatic vessels are little known. No nerves have been traced into the interior of the corpus cavernosum. t The triangular suspensonj ligament of the penis. This ligament is composed of yellow elastic tissue, and extends in the median line from the symphysis pubis to the corpus cavernosum. Muscular fibres have been described as existing in it; but it is probable some fibres prolonged from the bulbo-caver- nosus, and now known as the muscle of Houston, have been regarded as forming part of this ligament. I have seen the suspensory ligament reach along the linea alba, half way up to the umbilicus. * [Miiller has described, besides the nutritious arteries of the corpus cavernosum, which ter- minate iis usual in the veins, a peculiar set of vessels, called the arterim helicinte. They are short curled branches, much larger than capillaries, and ending abruptly in free rounded ex- tremities ; they project either singly, or in tufts arising from one stem, rato the venous cells, by the lining membrane of which tliey are supported and invested. They are found princi- pally in the posterior portions of the cavernous and spongy bodies, and are more marked in man than in animals. Tn the horse they are very indistinct; in the elephant they do not exist at all. Miiller believes that the blood, during erection, is poured out directly from these vessels into the venous cells; but no openings through which the blood could escape have been de- tected, either in their sides or at their extremities, nor is .analogy in favour of their existence. According to Valentin, the so-called helicine arteries arc the divided branches of common arteries curled up (after h.iving been injected), in conse(]uenco of the retraction of the elastic trabeculffi on whicli they are supported; to this it is replied, by IMiiller, that these vessels may be seen in cells deeper than the surface of the section. Valentin further maintains that the arteries terminate in the veins by wide funnel-shaped orifices.] t [Numerous nerves enter tlie corpus cavernosum ; thoy are derived from the internal pudic and sympathetic nerves, and have been carefully traced by Miiller.]SPLANCHNOLOGY. 608 Muscles of the Penis. These are eight in number, four on each side, viz. the ischio-cavemosus, the oulbo-cavenwsus, the pubio-urethralis, and the ischio-bulbosus. The Ischio-cavernosus, or the Erector Penis. The ischio-cavernosus ic,fig. 163.) is an elongated muscle, situated upon the corresponding root of the corpus cavernosum ; it is curved upon itself, and is aponeurotic in part of its extent. It arises from the inner lip of the tuberosity of the ischium, below the trans- versus perinaai, by tendinous and fleshy fibres, and also from the surface of the root of the corpus cavernosum. From these points its fibres pass inwards, and are inserted, after a short course, into the edges of the upper surface of a very strong, shining, and fasciculated aponeurosis, having its fibres directed from behind forwards, which covers the corresponding root of the cavernous body, upon which it is then prolonged. The fleshy fibres, terminating at the edges of the aponeurosis, form two bundles ; one, internal, and extending upon the inner side of the root, the other external, which passes on the outer side of the same, and is prolonged, much further than the internal fasciculus, upon the ca- vernous body. In order to see the structure of this muscle, it is necessary to make a longitudinal incision into the aponeurosis, which entirely covers its lower surface; we then observe a muscular layer, which is tolerably thick behind, but thin in front, and is formed partly by the original fibres, and partly by others arising from the root of the corpus cavernosum itself. Relations. Below, with the cellular tissue and the dartos ; above, with the root of the corpus cavernosum, upon which it is closely applied; on the inside, with the bulbo-cavernosus, being separated from it by a triangular space, the base of which is directed backwards. Uses. It acts solely upon the corpus cavernosum, drawing the root of the penis downwards and backwards; instead of compressing the root of the corpus cavernosum by the contraction of its fibres, it tends, on the contrary, to dilate its cavity, by separating the lower from the upper wall, and in this manner facilitates erection. The Bulbo-cavernosus, or Accelerator Urince. This muscle {d,Jig. 163.) is much larger than the preceding; it is situated'm front of the anus, extending along the lower surface of the bulb and the spongy portion of the urethra, upon which it seems to be moulded. It arises in front of the sphincter ani by a median fibrous raphe, which is common to the two muscles of this name, and which appears to arise from the bulb, to which it adheres closely ; whilst the external fibres arise from the pos- terior margin of the triangular ligament, or deep perineal fascia, and frequently from the rami of the ossa pubis, opposite that margin. From this double origin the fibres pass forwards, and terminate in the following manner: the outermost fibres form a thin layer upon the lower surface of the triangular ligament, and are inserted by short tendinous fibres to the inner side of the root of the corpus cavernosum; the middle fibres, which are larger, are directed obliquely inwards, and are inserted by very distinct tendinous fibres im- mediately in front of the point of junction of the roots of the corpus cavernosum, in the sort of groove between that body and the urethra; the innermost fibres are the longest; thev pass directly forwards, and, at the point where the penis is bent in front of the pubis, are inflected outwards (,e,fg. 163.), pass upon the sides of the penis, and terminate on its dorsal surface, becoming continuous with the suspensory ligament. The last named termination appears to me to constitute the muscle described by Houston ; which, according to that anato-THE PENIS. mist is intended to compress the dorsal veins of the penis* in man and otlier SaJs but it is evident, on the one hand, that it cannot compress the veins of SVenis and on the other, as M.

The inner border ^on muous with the muscle of the opposite side; so that, at first sight, it might be thought that there is but one bulbo-cavernosus.. i,, Uses Its attachment to the inner side of the corpus cavernosum enables it to separate the lower waU of that body from the upper, and consequently to induce the entrance of the blood. It therefore contributes powerfully to erec tion. On the other hand, by compressing the urethra, it accelerates the ex- pulsion of the urine and semen. The Pubio-iireihralia. This muscle, known also as the muscle of Wilson, because it was described by that anatomist, may be regarded as the continuation of the levator am. The two muscles arise from the middle of the sub-pubic arch, and descend first upon the sides and then on the lower surface of the membranous portion of the urethra, which they surround as in a ring. They are situated behind the triangular ligament, or deep perineal fascia.% When spasmodicaUy contracted, it is said that they may arrest the point of a catheter. » rXhe cotnpressores vena? dorsalis penis, according to Houston {Dublin Hasp. Reports, vol V ) arise from the rami of tlie pubes above the erectores penis and the crura ot the corpus cavernosum, expand into a thin layer, pass upwards, inwards, and forwards, and unite in a common tendinous band over the dorsal vein. They are separated by the crura from the erec- tores penis, of which muscles, he says, they might otherwise be regarded as portions ; the an- terior layer of the triangular ligament and the pudic artery are interposed between them and the muscles of Wilson.] . , ... ^ j t. i, i . xt t Dissertation sur quelques Points d'Anatomie, de Physiologie, et de Pathologic, No. cccxv. 1833 [The dorsal veins return the greater part of the blood from the glans penis and corpus spongiosum, as well as the skin, and are also joined by brandies from the corpus cavernosum. (See M. Cruveilhier's own description of these veins ; Angeiology.)] t [In the description of the muscles given by Wilson himsell (Med. Chir. Tram. vol. i. pp. 176, 177.), it is stated, that "the line of tendon connecting the two bellies of these muscles is in, ceneral very distinctly seen running from the apex of the prostate gland, along the under sur- face of the membranous portion of the urethra, until it enters the corpus spongiosum penis." From this it would appear, that the muscles discovered by him are placed between the two layers of the ligament, not behind its posterior layer. On the same plane with Wilson's muscles, i. e. between the layers of the ligament, are situ- ated two small transverse muscles, which arise, one on each side, by broad thin tendons, from the rami of the ischia, near their junction with those of the ossa pubis, immediately above the crura penis and their erector muscles; from thence the fleshy fibres pass transversely inwards and upwards, and are inserted along the median line of the upper and under surface of the membranous portion the urethra by means of two tendinous structures ; which extend, one above the urethra, from the fascia covering the prostate to the union of the crura penis in front of the triangular ligament, and the other below that canal, from the fascia on the prostate to the central point of the perineum: to this tendinous structure the vertical muscles of Wilson are also attached. The pudic arteries run either above or below these transverse muscles, the lower fibres of which pass below Cowper's glands, i. e. more superficially, when viewed from the perineum. These transverse muscles are described and figured by Santorini (Observ. Anat. ex. \ viii. t. 3. fig. 5.; also Septemdccim Tabula:, 1.16. fig. 1.), who states, however, that they are at- tached only to the lower surface of the urethra, behind the bulb ; he named them elevatores urethras, or ejaculatores. It has been recently shown by Mr. Guthrie {Land. Med. and Surg. Journ. 1833, pp. 491, 492. ; also. On the Anatmny and Diseases of the Neck of the Bladder and of the Urethra, 1834, p. 34. &c.) that the transverse muscles of Santorini are inserted, as already described, both above and below the urethra; and that the vertical muscles of Wilson are blended with them at their insertions: he therefore proposes to regard them as one muscle^ which has been termed the compressor urethrte.] VOL. I. R BSPLANCHNOLOGY. 610 The Iscliio-bulloims. We may describe under this name a small muscle situated below the deep permeal tascia. It is stronger than the transversus periuEei; it arises from the ascendmg ramus of the ischium and the descending ramus of the pubis, and terminates on the sides of the bulb. This muscle, which is of a triangular shape, is separated from the one last described by the deep perineal fascL so that It cannot be regarded as a dependence of the levator ani.* The Urethra. The urethra is the excretory passage for the urine, and in the male it serves the same purpose in regard to the semen. Its direction has been particularly studied. Commencing at the neck of the bladder, it passes forwards and downwards ; having arrived beneath the sym- physis pubis, it describes a slight curve, with the concavity directed upwards embraces the symphysis, rises a little in front of it, and then enters the groove on the lower surface of the corpus cavemosum. Beyond this point its direction is determined by that of the penis; and it describes, with that organ, a second curve, much more marked than the preceding, having its concavity directed downwards, but only in the state of relaxation, for the curve no longer exists -when the penis becomes elongated, either from erection, or from direct traction. It follows, therefore, that, except during erection, the urethra describes two curves, like the letter S f; but when the penis is elongated, it forms only a single curve, which is permanent. Although the curvature of the urethra is not so rigid as to prevent the in- troduction of a straight instrument into the bladder, it would be wrong to con- clude that the canal itself is straight. It must be remembered that organic membranous ducts are sufficiently pliable to accommodate themselves to the direction of instruments introduced into them ; but the effacing, or the ar- tificial removal of the curves is very different from their non-existence. Moreover, the curvature of the urethra is demonstrated by the impossibility of drawing a straight line from the neck of the bladder, and passing a short dis- tance below the symphysis to the point where the urethra joins the corpus ca- vernosum; also by the curve acquired by bougies after remaining for some time in the urethra; and lastly, by the curvature presented by a mould obtained by injecting the bladder and urethra with any substance capable of becoming solid. Dimensions. The length of the urethra isfrom eight to nine inches ; it is some - times less than eight. The extreme dimensions noticed by Whately %, in mea- surements taken from forty-eight subjects, are nine inches six lines and seven inches six lines. It is difficult to estimate the width of the urethra. According to Home, it is four lines, except at the orifice, where it is only three. It is quite im- possible to judge of its width externally on account of the thickness of its walls, and especially on accoimt of their being unequal. The extreme dilatability of the canal allows the introduction of instruments of considerable caliber, as in the operation of lithotrity. The urethra is considered as divided into three portions, as different in their structure as in their relations; these are the prostatic, the membranous, and the spongy portions. The prostatic portion. This part of the urethra, which forms, as it were, a continuation of the bladder, and the commencement of the urethra, is called * [The description of this muscle corresponds exactly with that of the iransversus perinen alter of Albinus.] t It was this direction of the canal which suggested to J.

The prostate (i,fig. 181.), a whitish glandular body, is situated in front of the neck of the bladder, and embraces it; it is behind the symphysis pubis, and m front of the rectum. It is shaped like a cone, with its base turned backwards, and its truncated apex forwards. Its axis or long diameter is horizontal, but slopes a little from behind downwards and forwards. It has often a bi-lobed appearance in man, but it is never truly double, as in a great number of animals. The size of the prostate varies greatly in different subjects. The following dimensions have been taken from the measurements of the prostates of adults: vertical diameter twelve lines, transverse eig:hteen, antero-posterior, or length, fifteen. Sometimes it acquires three or four times its nominal size ; the increase may affect either the whole gland, or one half, or the middle lobe only. Relations. We shall examine the relations of the prostate with the parts corresponding to its outer sm-face, and with those which are situated within it. Relations of the outer surface of the prostate. The lower surface corresponds with the rectum, adhering to it by tolerably dense cellular tissue, in which there is never any fat or serum ; and hence the rule of examining the prostate by the rectum. In consequence of alterations in the condition of the rectum, that intestine sometimes projects on each side beyond the prostate, as during dis- tension ; and sometimes, as when it is contracted, the prostate projects beyond it laterally. The lower surface of the gland is smooth, and is traversed in the median line by an antero-posterior furrow, which is well marked in some sub- jects, and divides it into two equal portions. The upper surface is in relation with the recto-vesical fascia (q,fig. 181.), or rather with some very strong ligamentous bundles, which extend from the pubes to the bladder, and are called the ligaments of the bladder. This surface has no immediate relations with the arch of the pubes, behind which it is placed; it is always some lines distant from it. Nevertheless, by means of a silver catheter or sound, introduced into the bladder, we may draw the prostate under the pubes, and make it project in the perineum. The sides are embraced by the levator ani and levator prostata3. When the prostate is pushed downwards by the catheter its sides are embraced by the circumference of the arch of the pubes, and they then approach very near the trunk of the internal pudic artery. The base of the prostate embraces the neck of the bladder, and is prolonged a little upon that organ, so as to surround the vas deferens and the neck of the vesiculae seminales. The apex terminates behind the membranous portion of the urethra. Relations of the prostate with the parts situated in its interior. The prostate is perforated by the urethra, by the ejaculatory ducts, and by its own excretory ducts. The relations of the urethra with the prostate vary in different subjects: thus, sometimes its lower three-fourths only are surrounded by the gland, which is accordingly wanting above, and is merely grooved, not perforated by a canal; sometimes the prostate forms a complete hollow cylinder around the urethra. The portion of the prostate situated above the urethra is scarcely ever thicker than the part beneath it. In some cases, however, the urethra has been found occupying the lower part of the prostate, and only separated from the rectum by a very thin layer of glandular substance. When such is the case, the rectum is very liable to be wounded in the different steps of the operation of lithotomy. * In the natural state the prostate does not project into the urethra; but not unfrequently we find a prominence, of greater or less size, rising from the lower » The varieties in the situation of the urethra, in relation to the prostate, were well pointed out by M. Seiin, in an inaugur.il dissertation in 1825. According to his observations the por tion of the prostate situated below the canal is seven or eight lines thick in tlie middle and ten or eleven lines, when measured downwards and outwards. ' n. R 2612 SPLANCHNOLOGY. part of the urethra, opposite the base of the prostate, and obstructing more or less completely the commencement of that canal: this tubercle was named by Lieutaud, la luette vesicate {uvula vesicoe) ; by Sir Everard Home, an enlarge- ment of the middle lobe of the prostate. But, in the first place, this prominence only exists in disease; and, secondly, there is no middle lobe, unless that term be applied to the slightly grooved, and, therefore, thinner portion by -which the two lateral halves of the prostate are united. Relations of the ejacidatory ducts with the prostate. The ejaculatory ducts (d^fig. 186.), which lie close to each other, are received into a sort of conical canal, formed in the prostate. Some loose cellular tissue separates them from the substance of the gland, of which they are altogether independent; it was chiefly to the portion of the prostate which is situated above this canal that the name middle lobe was given by Home. Density. The density of the prostate is considerable, and yet the tissue of this gland is friable, and can be very easily torn after having been once di- vided. It is of the greatest importance to remember this friability in performing the operation of lithotomy. The prostate, in fact, is the only obstacle to the extraction of the calculus ; and when this gland has been divided in its antero- posterior diameter, the bladder itself may be torn with the greatest facility. Structure. The structure of the prostate can only be properly studied in the adult. In certain cases of hypertrophy without alteration of tissue, its cha- racters are, as it were, exaggerated. It consists of a collection of glandular lobules, which may be subdivided into granules pressed close to each other in the midst of a tissue that appears to me to be muscular, for it is continuous with the muscular coat of the bladder, and bears the most perfect resemblance to it in cases of hypertrophy. From these granules, which are generally of unequal size, small excretory ducts proceed, and unite into an irregular number of pro- static ducts, that open not upon the verumontanum itself, but upon its sides (see Jig. 182.), in the whole extent of the lower wall of the prostatic portion of the urethra, or prostatic siuus. I have assured myself of the existence of these ducts and their orifices in many cases where I have found them filled with in- numerable small calculi, resembling grains of brownish sand. The orifices of the prostatic ducts may be easily detected by pressing the gland, when the fluid secreted by it will be observed to exude at several points. The membranous portion. The membranous portion of the urethra (,c,fig. 181.) extends from the prostatic portion to the bulb, and passes upwards and for wards.* It is in relation above and laterally with the arch of the pubes, from which it is separated by some considerable veins, or rather by a sort of erectile tissue; below it corresponds with the rectum, but is separated from it by a triangular space, having its base directed forwards and downwards, and its apex back- wards and upwards. It is generally in this triangular space that the urethra is divided in the operation of lithotomy. Its upper concave surface is about an incli long ; its lower surface is from four to six lines. This difference in length is caused by the bulb projecting backwards upon the lower surface of the membranous portion of the urethra. This part of the canal is embraced laterally and below by the two muscular bundles which have been already described as the muscles of Wilson; and also by the transverse muscular fasciculi described by Santorini and Guthrie. The spongy portion. The spongy portion (Z) constitutes the greatest part of the length of the urethra; it commences opposite the symphysis pubis by a very considerable expansion, caUed the bulb (below I), and terminates at the extremity of the penis by another and stiU larger expansion, which constitutes the glans penis. * rThp membranous portion perforates both layers of the triangular ligament, about an inch hMoL thpTrch of the nSb"s (see^. 138.); but as the two layers are separated from each other H„ nw H^hpTrpa?er dL? of this ponion of he urethra is included between them ; a vep- small nanhsuLTed'Sd ?he posC[J,r layer: both layers are prolonged over the urethra, one forwards and the other backwards.]B B 3 THE URETHRA. ^'^^ The occupies the highest part of the pubic arch, and fills the interval r.e, por5»':.^ch -.^.Uy covered i. » ineUned to eonSder the melbr. to be mueb more curved th.. .t actually ... wp indo-pd of it onlv bv the external appearance oi the canal.

The glans, so called from its shape, is the conical enlargement which lorms the extremity of the penis. It is covered by the prepuce, which is united to it below by means of the fraenum ; its base projects considerably beyond the end of the corpus cavernosum, and forms what is called the corona glandis. This circular projection is grooved perpendicularly throughout its entire extent by somejarge nervous papillae, which are visible to the naked eye. The base of the glans is cut very obliquely, so that its upper surface is twice as long as its lower. Below, and in the median line, the corona glandis presents a groove in which the frsenum is received. At the extremity of the glans is situated the orifice of the urethra, meatus urinaruis, a vertical fissure, three or four lines in extent, and placed in the same line as the fraenum, from which it is separated by a very short interval. Some- times this orifice is placed exactly opposite the frsenum, and, like it, is directed downwards : this malformation constitutes what is called hypospadias. Internal surface of the urethra. Upon this surface {see fig. 182.) we find no trace of the distinction established between the different portions of the urethra, considered from without, except that the prostatic portion of the canal is of a white colour, whilst all the rest of it is of a more or less deep violet hue. ^ Dimensions. Opposite the prostate the urethra becomes dilated, sometimes to a considerable extent (sinus prostaticus); at the commencement of the mem- branous portion it suddenly contracts, and then continues cylindrical as far as the glans, where it again dilates so as to form the fossa navicularis (o), and terminates by an orifice, which is the narrowest part of the entire canal. J In order to obtain more exact ideas of the comparative dimensions of the different portions of the urethra, M.

The whole of the inner surface of the urethra presents a number of oblique orifices, which lead into culs-de-sac of variable depths. These sinuses, the orifices of which are always directed forwards, are sometimes large enough to receive the extrem- ities of bougies ; they were very well described by Morgagni, and therefore they are generaUy called the sinuses of Morgagni. 1 have seen them more than an inch long. No glands open into them.* The verumontanum, or crest of the urethra. The lower wall of the membranous portion of the urethra presents, in the median line, a crest, which has been named the verumontanum, caput gallinaginis, or urethral crest (o to d). This crest commences in front by a very delicate extremity ; is directed backwards along the median line, and terminates at the anterior part of the prostatic por- tion by an enlarged extremity (a), upon which the ejaculatory ducts open by two distinct orifices. From this posterior extremity several radiated folds pro- ceed on either side, called the frcena of the verumontanum, which are lost iu the opening of the neck of the bladder; they were carefully described by Lan- genbeck. The prostatic ducts open at the sides of the verumontanum. Structure of the urethra. A very fine transparent mucous membrane, of an epidermic character, lines the inner surface of the urethra; and is continuous, on the one hand, with the mucous membrane of the bladder, and on the other with that covering the glans. It is also continued through the ejaculatory ducts, into the vasa deferentia and the vesiculae seminales. f The structure of the urethra, as regards the coats external to the mucous membrane, is not the same in the different portions of the canal. In the prostatic portion, we find the same elements as in the bladder, which seems as if it were continued into the cavity of the prostate. The deepest layer of the muscular coat of the bladder is prolonged between the mucous membrane and the prostate, while the other layers form different planes which penetrate into the substance of the gland. The membranous portion would be more correctly denominated the muscular part of the canal, for it is surrounded by a layer of muscular fibres. A plexus of veins surrounds these muscular fibres. The spongy portion {If,fig. 182.; c,fig. 187.) has a similar appearance to that of the cavernous body; it is an erectile structure, composed of a fibrous frame-work, formed by numerous prolongations interlaced in all directions, so * [One of these sinuses or lacunse, larger than the rest, and situated on the upper surface of the fossa navicularis, is called the lacuna magna ; they appear to be mucous crj-pts.] t [It is prolonged into the ducts of Cowper s glands and the prostate, into the vesicula semi- nales, vasa deferentia, and tubuli seminiferi, and through the ureters into the uriniferous ducts ; in the female it also lines the vagina, uterus, and Fallopian tubes ; the whole forms the genito-iirinary system of mucous membranes : it is covered throughout with an epithelium, which in the male generative apparatus approaches the columnar form.]B R 4 THE OVARIES. as to resemble areolar tissue. It is probable that the internal coat of the veins Unes all the cells, which contain more or less blood, according to the ''In Se UsfuT of the corpus spongiosum, as well as in that of the corpus ca- vernosuma^eWlongitLinalmL L theTa^Ker animals, and the existence of which appears to be shewn by the microscope in the human subject. The structure of the glans (//) is exactly le same aVthat of the bulb, only its tissue is more dense. The corpus spon- giosum LthriB does not communicate with the corpus cavernosum although f first sight it appears to be nothing more than a continuation of it The b unt extremity of the corpus cavernosum is evidently embraced by the base of the glans but no communication exists between the erectile tissue composing these two bodies, so that it is possible to inject them separately. THE GENERATIVE ORGANS OF THE FEMALE. The Ovaries. — The Fallopian Tubes. —The Uterus. —The Vagina. —The Urethra. — The Vulva. The genital organs of the female consist of the ovaries, the Fallopian tubes, the uterus, the vagina, and the several parts forming the vulva. With these we may include the mamma, as appendages to the generative apparatus. The Ovaries. The ovaries (pvarid), so called on account of the small vesicular ova which they contain, are the representatives of the testicles in the male ; the product secreted by both the one and the other is absolutely indispensable for repro- duction. From this analogy between the ovaries and testes the ancients called them testes muliebres {Galen'). The ovaries (a a,,fig. 188.) are two in number, and are situated one on each side of the uterus, in that portion of the broad ligament (d d',) termed the posterior ala (6), and behind the Fallopian tube. They are retained in this position by the broad ligament, and by a proper ligament called the ligament of the ovary (c). Their situation varies at different ages, and also according to the state of the uterus. In the foetus, they are placed in the lumbar regions, like the testicles. During pregnancy, they are carried up into the abdomen with the uterus, upon the sides of which they are applied. Immediately after delivery, they occupy the iliac fossae, where they sometimes remain during the whole period of life, being retained there by accidental adhesions. It is extremely common to fi.nd them thrown backwards *, and adhering to the posterior surface of the uterus. The ovary has sometimes been found in inguinal or femoral hernise : by descending into the labia majora, they have simulated the appearance of tes- ticles. The size of the ovaries varies according to age, and according as the uterus is gravid or unimpregnated, healthy or diseased. They are relatively larger in the foetus than in the adult; they diminish in size after birth, again increase at the period of puberty, and become atrophied in old age. During the latter periods of pregnancy, they sometimes acquire double or triple their ordinary size.

The tissue of this ligament strongly resembles that of the uterus and seems to be a prolongation from it.* ' Structure. The ovary is composed externally of a dense fibrous coat, covered by the peritoneum, which adheres so closely to it, that it cannot be detached; and, internally, of a spongy and vascular tissue, the areola; of which seem to be formed by very delicate prolongations from the external coat; in the midst of this tissue (the stroma, from o-rpai/ia, a bed) the Graafian vesicles are depo- sited. These vesicles vary in number from three or four to fifty. The structure of the ovary is most evident in the recently delivered female. At that time its tissue, expanded, and, as it were, spongy, appears to me to resemble that of the dartos, and is traversed by a great number of vessels. I have also seen, in re- cently delivered females, the ovaries from twelve to fifteen times larger than usual, and converted into a sac, having very thin parietes, which were easily torn; the ovary itself was of a spongy, vascular, and diffluent texture, in the midst of which the vesicles were seen unaltered. The vesicles are nothing more than small cysts of variable size, with very thin transparent walls, adhering to the tissue of the ovary, and containing a limpid serosity, either colourless or of a citron yellow. According to Von Baer, the most superficial vesicles, which approach the expanded extremity of the Fallopian tube, contain a floating body, which was imperfectly seen by Malpighi, and constitutes the germ or ovum.f I have often met with ovaries destitute of vesicles ; but then they had un- dergone some change, that of induration for example. May the absence of these vesicles be regarded as a cause of sterility ? The corpora lutea, according to the observations of Haller, consist of the re- mains of vesicles that have been ruptured in consequence of the act of impreg- nation ; they are brownish-yellow masses, of a tolerably firm consistence, and which I have found as large as a cherry-stone in females recently delivered. These bodies have been ascertained to exist in females who have never borne children, and this anomaly has been explained by supposing that they may be produced in consequence of masturbation. We would remark, however, that there is no constant relation between the existence of these bodies and the oc- currence of fecundation. In some females who have had many children, no * It has even been stated that this so called efferent duct of the ovary divides into two branches, one of which opens directly into the uterus, while the other rups along its border, and opens near the os uteri. t [The vesicles of De Graaf vary from the size of a pea to that of a pin's head ; they have two tunics, one external and vascular, the other, called tlie ovi-cripstde, which, according to Schwann, is lined internally with epithelium (membrana granulosa, Baer). In each vesicle there is usually but one ovum; which at first occupies its centre, but in the mature condition approaches the inner surface of its internal coat, and surrounded by a granular covering (tunica granulosa, Barry), is held there by retinacula (.Barry). The ovum is a perfectly spherical body, of uniform size (about f^^th of an inch in diameter); it consists of a thiclc but very trans- parent coat (zona pellucida, Valentin; chorion, IVagner), which surrounds the substance of the yolk ; within the yolk is situated the germinal vesicle of Purkinj§ (about ,jlj,th of an incli in diameter), and within that the germinal spot of Wagner (about jj^th, or ^jlpth of an inch). The changes incidental to impregnation, according to Dr. Barry, commence in the germinal spot and vesicle.

Without precisely determining the part performed by the ovaries in repi^duction, it may be said that they are indispensable to that function. Extirpation of these bodies is followed by sterility. And, again ovarian foeta- tion proves that fecundation may occur withm the ovary. The use of the Graafian vesicles in generation is not well known.* The Fallopian Tubes. " The lubce uterinm (ff, fig. 188.) are two ducts, situated in the substance of the ■upper margin of the broad ligament. They are also called the tubse Fallopianse f, the Fallopian tubes, after Fallopius, who first gave a good description of them ; they extend from the upper angle of the uterus to the sides of the cavity of the true pelvis. Situation and direction. Floating as it were in the cavity of the pelvis, be- tween the ovaries behind, and the round ligaments (g g) in front, they pass transversely outwards, and at the point where they terminate, bend backwards and inwards, in order to approach the outer end of the ovary, to which they are attached by a small ligament. Each Fallopian tube is straight in the inner half of its course, but describes certain windings in the remaining outer portion, which are so considerable in certain cases, and especially when the tube has been the seat of chronic inflammation or of dropsy, as to resemble in some degree the windings of the vas deferens. Moreover, accidental adhesions of the expanded extremity very frequently give it an entirely different direction from the one it usually takes. The tubes may be drawn down with the ovaries into a hernial sac, as I have several times observed. The length of the Fallopian tubes is four or five inches, but it sometimes • varies on the two sides. The canal in their interior is very narrow along their inner half, but gradually enlarges as it proceeds outwards to their ter- mination, which is expanded and divided into irregular fringes, like the calyces of certain flowers: this expanded end constitutes the mouth of the trumpet, or the fimbriated extremity (e) of the Fallopian tube. lu order to obtain a good view of this structure, it is necessary to place the tube in water, and then a number of fringes or small shreds of unequal length will be seen floating in the liquid, and consisting of folds divided unequally, and sometimes forming two or three concentric circles. It is generally said that one of these fringes, longer than the rest, is attached to the outer end of the ovary ; but this con- nection appears to me to be effected by means of a small ligament. All these * See note, page 61G. t [Literally the Fallopian trunipcts, fvom their expanded abdominal extremities.]618 SPLANCHNOLOGY. folded fringes terminate around a circle somewhat narrower than the ad- joining portion of the tube: this circle constitutes the free orifice, or ostium abdommale of the tube. The outer portion of the tube will admit the end of a moderate-sized catheter, whilst the inner portion will scarcely admit a bristle. The diameter of that portion of the tube which traverses the uterine walls is capillary, and it is very difficult to detect with the naked eye its uterine orifice, or ostium uterinum (o o,fig. 189.). As the canal of the tube opens into the uterine cavity on the one hand, and into the cavity of the peritoneum on the other, it forms a direct communi- cation between the two ; and hence certain cases of peritonitis have been sup- posed to depend upon the passage of a flu'd from the uterus into the peritoneal sac. Not very unfrequently the fimbriated orifice of the tube is obliterated ; in this case the tube becomes dilated like a cone, having its base directed outwards, and it also becomes much more flexuous. When opened longitudinally, and placed under water, the outer or wide portion of the tube presents longitudinal folds of unequal breadth, and touch- ing by their free edges. There is no valve, either in the course or at the orifices of the tube. Its narrow portion is hard to the touch, inextensible, and closely resembles in appearance the vas deferens; its wide portion is collapsed, and its walls are thin and extensible. Structure. The peritoneum adheres closely to it, and forms its outer coat; it is lined by a mucous membrane, which can be easUy shown in the whole extent of the broad and folded portion, and appears to form of itself the lon- gitudinal folds already described. This lining membrane is continuous, on the one hand, with the uterine mucous membrane, and on the other, with the peritoneum, at the fimbriated extremity of the tube ; it thus presents the only example in the human body of the direct continuity of a serous and mucous membrane. Between the peritoneal and the mucous coats is found a proper membrane, which appears to be a prolongation of the tissue of the uterus, and is probably muscular.* Uses. The Fallopian tubes, which represent in the female the vasa defer- entia in the male, serve not only to transmit the fecundating principle of the male, but also to conduct the fecundated ovum into the uterus. These uses are proved by the sterility of females in whom the tubes have been tied; and lay the occurrence of tubal foetations, in which the fecundated ovum is arrested in the cavity of the tube, and there passes through the several stages of de- velopement. The fimbriated extremity of the tube is intended to embrace the ovary during the act of fecundation, and to apply itself to the spot from which the ovum is to be detached; it follows, therefore, that any adhesion of the ovary or of the tube, which prevents this, acts as a cause of sterility. The Uterus. The uterus (uter, a leather-bottle), matrix (mater), or womb, is the organ of gestation. It is situated (w, fig. 190.) in the cavity of the pelvis, in the median line between the bladder and the rectum, and is retained in that position by the round and broad ligament on each side, and by the upper end of the vagina below. The looseness and extensibility of its connections enable it to float, as it were, in the cavity of the pelvis, and to be moved to a greater or less extent. The facility with which it can be drawn towards the vulva in certain surgical » [MusculSr fibres have not yet been demonstrated in the human subject, though in some animals circular and longitudinal contractile fibres have been found.

Number The uterus is single in the human species -, it is double in most animals The cases of double uterus observed in the human subject are nothing more than bifid uteri, or such as are divided by a septum : this state may exist either in the body of the uterus alone, or at the same time m the body and neck, and even in the vagina. ^ • • i Size The size of the uterus varies according to age, and certain physiolo- gical conditions peculiar to this organ. It is very smaU until puberty, and then acquires the size which it subsequently presents. In females who have borne children it never returns to its original size. It becomes enormously enlarged during pregnancy, or from the developement of certain tumours. In old age it becomes atrophied, and is sometimes as small as it is in new-bom infants. The following are the measurements of the uterus after puberty : — length, two and a half to three inches; breadth at the fundus sixteen to eighteen Unes, at the neck six lines ; antero-posterior diameter, or thickness, six lines.* Weight. The weight of the uterus is from six to ten drachms at puberty, an ounce and a half or two ounces in females who have had children. I have seen it from one to two drachms in aged females, in whom it had become atrophied. At the end of pregnancy the weight of the uterus is from a pound and a half to three pounds. Form. The uterus is shaped like a small gourd, or a pear flattened from before backwards. It is divided into a bochj (m), and cervix or neck (A) ; the distinction between these two parts being established by a more or less marked constriction. Relations. These must be studied in front, behind, on the sides, at the upper border or fundus, and at the lower or vaginal extremity. The anterior surface is covered by the peritoneum in its upper three-fourths, and is indirectly in relation with the posterior surface of the bladder, from which it is often separated by some convolutions of the small intestine ; in its lower fourth it is in immediate contact with the inferior fundus of the bladder, and is united to it by rather loose cellular tissue. The latter relation explains why cancerous affections of the uterus so often extend to the base of the bladder. The posterior surface is entirely covered by the peritoneum, and is in relation with the anterior surface of the rectum, from which it is often separated by some convolutions of the small intestine. This surface is much more convex than the anterior; it may be examined from the rectum. Its sides are slightly concave, and give attachment to the broad ligaments (dd', dd'); which are two quadrilateral folds of peritoneum, extended trans- versely from the lateral borders of the uterus to the sides of the pelvis. Their upper margin is divided on each side into three folds or ridges, formed in the following manner—a posterior fold formed by the ovary (a) and its ligament (c), an anterior one by the round ligament {g), and a middle fold by the Fallopian tubes (./"). Hence some anatomists have described three wings (ate vespertilionis) in each of the broad ligaments. * [The body of the uterus at Its thickest part, viz. immediately below the fundus, is from eight to twelve lines thick.]SPLANCHNOLOGY. anil ramollissement of the body of the uterus, is so common that M.

Besides the broad ligaments there are also the ligaments of the ovary and the round ligaments, proceeding from the sides of the uterus. Ihe round ligaments (g g) have a fibrous appearance, but are evidently con- tinuous with the tissue of the uterus. They arise from the side of the uterus, below and in front of the FaUopian tubes, pass upwards and outwards in the anterior fold of the broad ligament, to the abdominal orifice of the inguinal canal, into which they enter, being accompanied by a prolongation of the peritoneum which forms around them a cylindrical sheath, called the canal of JSuck. In females far advanced in life, this sheath may be traced as far as the external orifice of the inguinal canal. Besides the uterine fibres which enter into its composition, the round liga- ment also contains a great number of veins, which may become varicose, es- pecially near the external orifice of the inguinal canal, where they sometimes simulate a hernia. The upper border, or fundus (i), of the uterus is convex, and is directed up- wards and forwards; it is covered by convolutions of the small intestine; when not distended it never reaches as high as the brim of the pelvis, and cannot therefore be felt by the fingers in the hypogastric region. The lower or vaginal extremity of the uterus, caUed also the os tinea from its shape, is directed downwards and backwards; it is embraced by the vagina, into which it projects, and is divided by a transverse fissure into two lips, one anterior, the other posterior. The os tinea is small, and perforated by an almost circular opening («), in females who have not borne children ; but in those who have been mothers, it forms a more considerable projection, and its fissure is more marked and longer transversely.* In some females the OS tineas is of considerable length, and as it were hypertrophied, although the uterus is healthy. The anterior lip is thicker than the posterior, which is a little longer than the other. It frequently happens that in old females every trace of the lips of the OS tincse disappears; the orifice alone remains, and in some cases even that is obliterated. In such a case the vagina terminates in a cul-de-sac, at the bottom of which a round and yielding point may be felt. This disappear- ance of the two lips is much more common than the elongation of the neck of the uterus, which was pointed out by my venerable colleague M. Lallemand. Cavity of the uterus. The cavity of the uterus is extremelj' small in com- parison with the size of the organ ; its figure is that of a curvilinear triangle; its walls are in contact, and are smooth, and covered with a layer of mucus. We shall examine it in the body and neck of the uterus. The cavity of the body of the uterus (u,fig. 189.) is of a triangular form, p;^ ]gg and has an opening at each angle. The inferior opening (ostium internum, h) establishes a free communication between the cavities of the body and neck; it is often obliterated in old women.f The other two orifices (o o) are those of the Fallopian tubes ; they are scarcely visible to the naked eye, and are situated at the bottom of two funnel-shaped cavities formed at the superior angles of the uterus, and constituting the remains of the division of the body of the uterus into two halves or cornua. This division, which is normal in many animals, is some- times met with in the human female. * I have seen the os tinea liicerated and assured in different directions, in consequence of •"t'This™bliteration, which c.iuses retention of mucus and blood and consequently distensionTHE UTERUS. 621 Pnn^Pnltal deficiency of the cavity of the uterus is very rare.

The internal surface of the body of the uterus is much more vascular than the neck This difference is particularly observed in females who have died during a menstrual period, in whom the vessels of the body of the womb are much developed, and that organ itself is swoUen and softened, while the cervix retains its accustomed whiteness and consistence. Another character of the uterine cavity is the existence of a greater or less number of transparent vesicles, which were mistaken by Naboth for ova (ova of Naboth), but are only muciferous follicles. They exist both in the body and neck of the uterus, but are more numerous in the neck, near the vaginal orifice, and only become apparent when the mucus accumulates in them from obliteration of their orifices. They are sometimes much enlarged, and have then given rise to the opinion that some more serious disease has existed. The orifices of the uterine sinuses, described by the older anatomists at the fundus of the uterus, cannot be detected. They are only to be seen after delivery in the situation where the placenta had been attached. The parietes of the unimpregnated uterus are from four to six lines in thickness. The thinnest part is at the entrance of the Fallopian tubes, where they are not more than two lines thick. The parietes of the cervix are thinner than those of the body. Structure of the uterus. The constituent parts of the uterus are, a proper tissue, an external peritoneal coat, an internal mucous membrane, and some vessels and nerves. The proper tissue is of a greyish colour, very dense and strong, and creaks under the knife like cartilage. The body appears less consistent than the neck, but this depends upon the fact of its being more frequently the seat of sanguineous congestion. It is composed of fibres, i. e, it has a linear arrange- ment. It may be asked, with regard to the nature of these fibres, do they consist of fibrous tissue ? are they muscular, or are they analogous to the yellow tissue of the arteries ? The following considerations will determine this question:— The walls of the unimpregnated uterus appear to be composed of a fibrous tissue, traversed by a great number of vessels. During pregnancy, or in con- sequence of the developement of tumours, or the accumulation of fluid in the cavity of the uterus, its proper tissue acquires all the properties of the muscular tissue, as it exists in the viscera of organic life, and, like it, is endowed with contractility. Can, therefore, the presence of a foetus or a foreign body in the uterus cause a transformation in the tissue of that organ ? f Assuredly not; but the great influx of blood into the uterus, and the consequent distension and de- velopment of its fibres, reveals a structure which before was concealed by the state of condensation and atrophy kept up by inactivity. * These rugiE, which vary considerably in their arrangement, have been described in detail by Haller, Boyer, and others. t 1 conceive that I have proved by facts, that only three tissues, viz. the muscular, the ner- vous, and the glandular, are never the products of organic transformations.

Some anatomists agree with Malpighi and Monro, that they have no regularity in their disposition, but are interlaced in an inex- tricable manner. It must be confessed that, in the unimpregnated uterus such is the case ; but during gestation, the arrangement of the greater number ot fibres can be traced.-f In the body the external thin layer is composed of two median vertical tascicub, one on each surface of the uterus ; of another fasciculus occupying the tundus, and of some obhque ascending and descending fibres, which converge towards the FaUopian tubes, the round ligaments, and the Ugaments of the ovaries, which contain prolongations of these fibres.f This first, or superficial layer, belongs exclusively to the body of the uterus. The deep layer of the body consists of two series of circular fibres ; each series forming a cone, the apex of which corresponds to the Fallopian tube, while the base is directed towards the median line, and is there blended with that of the oppo- site side. The neck is composed entirely of circular fibres, which intersect each other at very acute angles. The facts furnished by comparative anatomy perfectly accord with the pre- ceding description. Thus in the uterus of a sow, which had littered, I found that the cervix was composed exclusively of circular fibres; and that the cornua (aduterum of M. Geoffrey St. Hilaire), which represent the body of the uterus of the human female, were formed by two layers of fibres, one external and longitudinal, the other deep and circular. From this arrangement we may therefore conclude, that the human uterus results from the union of two cornua, which communicate directly with each other, instead of opening separately into the cavity of the cervix. When examined in the state of pregnancy, the tissue of the uterus is found to be traversed by venous canals, or uterine sinuses, which are of very con- siderable size, especially opposite the attachment of the placenta. This great number of vessels gives to the tissue of the uterus the appearance of an erectile or cavernous structure, having muscular parietes.§ The external or peritoneal coat. The peritoneum, after covering the posterior surface of the bladder, is reflected upon the anterior surface of the uterus, of which it covers only the upper three fourths, the lower fourth being in im- mediate contact with the bladder. At the fundus of the uterus, it passes to the posterior surface, which it covers entirely, is prolonged a short distance upon the vagina, and is then reflected upon the rectum. The broad ligaments are formed by a transverse duplicature of this coat. Two falciform folds, formed by this membrane betweeen the bladder and the uterus, are called the vesico-uterine ligaments, and two others, between the uterus and the rectum, are named the recto-uterine ligaments. The peritoneum adheres very loosely to the borders of the uterus, but much more closely as it approaches the median line. When enlarged during pregnancy the uterus becomes covered with the peritoneum of the broad * [The muscular fibres of the gravid uterus have been described by Dr. Baly (translation of Miiller's Physiology).

But the existence of a muTous membrane on the internal surface of the uterus appears to me in- contestablv proved by the following considerations:— • v j S every organised cavity which communicates with the exterior is hned by a mucoas membrane; why, therefore, should the uterus form an exception to this rule Secondly, by dissection it is shevra that the mucous membrane of the vagina is continued into the neck of the uterus, and then mto the body ; but in this latter situation it is destitute of epithehum.* Notwithstanding the difficulty of dissecting this membrane on account of its tenuity, and its close adhesion to the tissue of the uterus, its presence is demonstrated by the fol- lowing observations : under the microscope, the internal surface of the uterus presents a papillary appearance, but the papniaj are very smaU ; it is provided with follicles or crypts, from which mucus may be expressed by a number of points, and which 'form small vesicles when distended with mucus, m conse- quence of obstruction or obliteration of their orifices. Thirdly, it is extremely vascular, and presents a capillary net-work of the same appearance as that of the other mucous membranes; and lastly, it is constantly lubricated with mucus. Pathological observations also show, that the internal surface of the uterus, like all mucous membranes, is liable to spontaneous haemorrhages from exhalation, without breach of continuity, to catarrhic secretions, and to those growths which are denominated mucous, vesicular, and fibrous polypi: and it is generally admitted that, where there is an identity of disease, there is also identity of structure. During pregnancy the elements of the mucous membrane are separated; the vessels become penicillate, and greatly increased in size; but in proportion as the uterus returns to its original dimensions, the mucous membrane regains its primitive form, and its dissociated elements approach each other. It seems as if this membrane was destroyed by a true exfoliation, and then entirely reproduced. The arteries of the uterus are derived from two sources ; the principal, called the uterine, arise from the hypogastric ; the others proceed from the spermatic or ovarian arteries to the borders of the uterus, and are distributed upon it: both sets are very tortuous. The veins are remarkable for their enormous size during pregnancy and after parturition. The term uterine sinuses has been given to the large veins which are then found in the substance of the organ ; and this term is not altogether without foundation, for these venous canals are formed by the lining membrane of the veins which adheres to the proper tissue of the uterus, just as in the si- nuses of the dura mater it adheres to the fibrous tissue of that membrane. The lymphatics, which have been well examined only during pregnancy and after parturition, at which time I have often seen them full of pus, are, like the veins, extremely large (see Anat. Path, avee planches, liv. xiv.) ; they form se- veral layers in the substance of the uterus, the most superficial of which is the most developed. They terminate in the pelvic and lumbar lymphatic glands; some accompany the ovarian veins. The nerves, as seen in the pregnant condition, have been well described and figured by Tiedemann. Some of them are derived from the renal plexus, and * [The mucous membrane of the uterus contains numerous tubular glands, or crypts re- sembling, in form and direction, the tubuli of the stomach, and the crypts of Lieberkuehn found in the intestinal canal.

Developement. It is generally agreed that the body of the uterus is always bihd, or two-horned, in the embryo, up to the end of the third month ; and that towards the end of the fourth month the two halves are united to form a single cavity.^ I have not observed this in the earliest periods of intra-uterine life. Daring foetal life the uterus, instead of presenting the same form as it sub- sequently possesses, is decidedly larger at the neck than in the body : at this- period the broadest part of the uterus is its vaginal extremity. After birth, and up to the time of puberty, the developement of the uterus is almost stationary ; so that, according to the observations of Roederer, which are confirmed by Professor Duges, it is from twelve to fourteen lines long in the new-born infant, and only an inch and a half at ten years of age. At puberty the uterus rapidly acquires its full dimensions, and at the same time becomes the seat of a periodic and sanguineous exhalation, the occurrence of which constitutes menstruation. In old age the uterus becomes atrophied, and altered in shape; the cervix and body are separated by a much more decided constriction. These two parts of the uterus seem to become more independent of each other. The lips of the OS tincffi are generally effaced in old women. The tissue of the body preserves its softness, whilst that of the neck acquires an extreme density. The situation of the uterus is very different at di£Fei-ent ages. In the foetus it projects beyond the brim of the pelvis, and is in the abdominal cavity ; after birth, and in consequence of the developement of the pelvis, it seems gradually to sink into that cavity. At the age of ten years the fundus of the uterus is on a level with the brim ; afterwards it is lower down. In old women it is ge- nerally inclined to one side, or reversed upon the rectum. Functions. The uterus is the organ of gestation ; the fecundated ovum is deposited in its cavity, and there meets with the most favourable conditions for its developement. The uterus is also the principal agent in the expulsion of the foetus. The Vagina. The vagina is a membranous canal, extending from the vulva to the uterus ; it is the female organ of copulation, and also forms the passage for the men- strual blood, and the product of conception. It is situated in the cavity of the pelvis between the bladder and the rectum,, and is held in that situation by tolerably close adhesions to the neighbouring parts, but still is so loose that it can be everted like the finger of a glove. Direction. It is directed obliquely forwards and downwards, i. e. it coincides with the axis of the outlet of the pelvis ; and as the direction of the uterus cor- responds with the axis of the brim, these two parts form an angle or curvature with each other, having its concavity directed forwards. Shape and dimensions. The vagina is shaped like a cylinder, flattened from before backwards, and having its walls in contact, as may be seen upon apply- ing the speculum. It is from four to five inches long *; sometimes it is much shorter, I have seen it as short as an inch and a half. This congenital short- ness must be distinguished from the apparent shortness produced by prolapsus uteri. •£ • The vagina is not of the same diameter throughout. Its lower ormce is tnC; narrowest part, whUe its upper extremity is the widest. In females who have borne children the bottom of the vagina forms a large ampulla, in which the speculum may be moved about extensively, and in which, also, a considerable quantity of blood may accumulate during hfemorrhage. It is moreover a di- latable canal, as is proved during parturition ; and is at the same tune elastic, * [Trom the nature of the curve formed by the vagina, its anterior wall is shorter than the posterior.]THE VAGINA. 625 and contracts after delivery, so as almost to return to its original dimensions. It would appear, also, to be capable of a vermicular contraction Relations In front, wliere it is slightly concave, it corresponds to the infer or fundus of the bladder, to which it is united by very dense filamentous ceUuIar tissue resembling the dartos; it cannot be separated from the urethra, which anoears to be hoUowed out of the substance of its walls. The close adhesion of the va-ina to the bladder and urethra accounts for these latter organs always foUowfng the uterus in its displacements. Behind, the vagina corresponds with the rectum, through the medium of the peritoneum in its upper fourth, and im- mediately in its lower three fourths. It adheres to the rectum by cellular tissue resembUng the dartos, and analogous to that existing between it and the bladder, but much looser, so that the rectum does not follow the vagina in its displace- ment The sides of the vagina give attachment to the broad ligaments above, and to the superior pelvic fascia and the levatores ani below, and they are in relation with the ceUular tissue of the pelvis and with some venous plexuses. Internal surface. The internal surface of the vagina is covered with an epithelium whicb can be very easily demonstrated, and which is prolonged as far as the os uteri, where it terminates by a sort of indented margin, in the sanie manner as the epithelium of the oesophagus ceases at the stomach. * This surface presents on both walls, but especially in front and near the orifice of the vulva, some transverse ruga;, or rather prominences, which very nearly resemble the irregular ridges upon the palate; they all pass from a median prominent line, which is often prolonged like a median raphe along the whole anterior wall of the vagina; the raphe on the posterior wall is not so well marked. These two median raphes are called the columns of the vagina. They are the remains of the median septiim, which generally co-exists with a bifid uterus, but exists sometimes independently of it. The transverse rugae of the vagina are very numerous in the new-born infant and in virgins; they are partially effaced after the first labour, at the upper part of the vagina, but always remain at the lower part. These rugse are not folds, and do not appear to assist in the enlargement of the vagina. The upper extremity of the vagina embraces the neck of the uterus, upon which it is prolonged without any line of demarcation, and forms a circular trench around the os tincee, which is deeper behind than in front. The lower extremity, or opening into the vulva, presents a corrugated trans- verse projection in front, which is exposed by separating the labia and nymphfe; it narrows, and seems even to close the entrance of the vagina. In virgins, the orifice of the vulva is provided with a membrane, concerning the form and existence of which there have been numerous disputes; it is called the hymen, and is a sort of diaphragm interposed between the internal genitals on the one hand, and the external genitals and urinary passages on the other. This membrane is of a crescentic shape, having its concavity di- rected forwards, and closing up the posterior and lateral parts of the vagina: it sometimes forms a complete circle, perforated in the centre. Its free mar- gin is fringed; it varies in breadth in different individuals, and thus regulates the dimensions of the vaginal orifice. The hymen sometimes forms a com- plete membrane, constituting what is called imperforate vagina. The hymen is composed of a duplicature of mucous membrane, varying in strength, and containing within it some cellular tissue and vessels. The debris remaining after its laceration constitute the carunculce myriiformes, which vary in number from two to five. Structure. The walls of the vagina consist of an erectile spongy tissue in- terposed between two very strong fibrous layers, of which the external is the thicker. Around this erectile tissue we find a tolerably thick layer resembling the tissue of the dartos condensed. I cannot agree with some anatomists in admitting an identity of structure in the walls of the vagina and uterus, for in * [In both of these situations the epithelium does not cease, but is merely chansred in its cha- racter (see notes, p. 623.).] VOL. I. 8 S626 SPLANCHNOLOGY. no case does the vagina assume a muscular character like the latter organ. From the presence of the dartoid tissue an obscure vermicular movement may take place, and assist the elasticity of the walls of the vagina. The posterior wall and the upper part of the anterior wall are thin; the va- gina is very much thicker opposite the urethra, which seems to be hollowed out of its substance, and terminates by a rugous enlargement, which forms at the entrance of the vagina the projection already mentioned, and which is only a very dense spongy tissue. The mucous membrane of the vagina is remarkable for the thickness of its epithelium*, for its close adhesion to the proper membrane, and for its highly developed papillae, especially at the entrance of the passage, where the rugaj are nothing more than papillae in an exaggerated form. The mucous follicles can be easily demonstrated. The bulb of the vagina. Besides the spongy expansion at the orifice of the vagina, there is in front and on each side of this orifice an enlargement or cavernous body, occupying the interval between the entrance of the vagina and the roots of the clitoris. It is not very thick in the middle, where it is placed between the meatus urinarius and the union of the roots of the clitoris, but gradually enlarges from this point, and terminates below upon each side of the vagina by an enlarged extremity. The posterior wall of the vagina is the only part in which it does not exist. In position, as well as shape, it resembles the bulb of the m-ethra in the male, f The constrictor vagina. This consists of two muscles, one on each side of the orifice of the vagina, the arrangement of which very nearly resembles that of the bulbo-cavernosus in the male. Each muscle commences in front of the rectum by an interlacement of fibres common to it, to its fellow of the opposite side, and to the sphincter ani, passes forwards under the form of a flattened band, and terminates upon the sides of the clitoris, a portion being continued above it and blended with the suspensory ligament of that body. Relations. It is covered on the outside by the skin and the fatty cellular tissue of the labia majora; it corresponds on the inside with the bulb of the va- gina, which it must strongly compress. The proper vaginal arteries arise from the hypogastric. The uterine arteries also send numerous branches to the vagina. The veins are very numerous, form plexuses, and terminate in the hypogas- tric veins. The nerves are derived from the hypogastric plexus. Developement. The rugae of the vagina are not visible until about the end of the fifth month of intra-uterine life; from the sixth to the eighth they become much more developed than they are subsequently. The transverse rug£e are visible in the whole length of the vagina, and are placed closely to each other. The hymen does not make its appearance until about the middle of foetal life; it is directed forwards, and is rough and jagged. It is always present. The Urethra in the Female. This canal, which is, as it were, hollowed out of the anterior wall of the vagina, differs considerably from the male urethra, of which it represents the membranous portion only. It is about one inch in length. It is very difficult to determine its diameter on account of its dilatabdity; but it is about three or four lines when quite undilated. Its lower end is somewhat contracted. It is directed obUquely downwards and forwards, and is shghtly concave m front. * TThP pnithpliura in the vagina, and also in the vulva, is squamous.] + In one subject on"hrouter side of this vaginal bulb.

It is surrounded by a thick layer of circular muscular fibres, which seem to be continuous with the fibres of the bladder, some of the lon- gitudinal fibres of that organ being prolonged upon the outside of these. A thin layer of spongy or erectUe tissue Ues subjacent to the mucous membrane, which is very thin. The Vulva. Under the term vulva we include all the external genitals of the female; viz the mons Veneris, the labia majora and minora, the clitoris, and the meatus urinarius, to which we may add the orifice of the vagina already described. The mons Veneris is a rounded eminence, more or less prominent m different individuals, situated in front of the pubes, and surmounting the vulva; the prominence of this part is owing partly to the bones, and partly to a collection of fatty tissue beneath the skin; it is covered with hair at the time of puberty. The labia majora are two prominent cutaneous folds, which form the limits of an antero-posterior opening, by most anatomists named the vulva. They are flattened transversely, and are thicker in front than behind; their external surfaces are covered with hairs; their internal surfaces are moist and smooth, and in contact with each other; their free borders are convex and provided with hair ; their anterior extremities are continuous with the mons Veneris ; their posterior extremities unite to form a commissure called the fourchette, which is almost always lacerated in the first labour. The interval between the fourchette and the anus constitutes the perineum, which is generally from eight to ten lines long. The interval between the fourchette and the entrance of the vagina is called the foSsa navicularis. The constituent parts of the labia majora are, a cutaneous layer, a mucous layer, both provided with numerous sebaceous follicles, f In fat persons, a great quantity of adipose tissue, a layer of dartoid tissue next the mucous membrane, and some arteries, veins, lymphatics, and nerves. They are there- fore very analogous to the scrotum in the male, and, like it, are liable to serous infiltration in anasarca. The labia minora, or nymphts, are seen after separating the labia majora, under the form of two layers of mucous membrane; they are narrow behind, * [The female urethra perforates the triangular ligament precisely in the same way as the membranous portion of the urethra in the male ; and moreover, between the two layers of the ligament it is surrounded by muscular fibres corresponding exactly with the compressor urethra; in the male sex. The vertical fibres, or Wilson's muscles, were noticed by him (toe. cit.), descending from the symphysis, separating on the urethra, and passing around it; the transverse fasciculi, which are often very large, form together the depressor urethrce of San- torini, and were described and figured by that author (06s. Anat.) as arising by a broad tendon from the lower part of the rami of the pubes, above the crectores clitoridis, passing obliquely upwards and inwards, and uniting with each other above the urethra. Mr. Guthrie has shown (/oc. oil.) that the relations of the vertical and transverse fasciculi to each other, to the urethra, and to the layers of the trianguKar ligament, are precisely tlie same as in the male.] ■f- It is not rare to see small and very short hairs growing from the sebaceous follicles on the inner surface of the labia miijora ; they arc analogous to those of the caruncula; lachrymales.628 SPLANCHNOLOGY. where they commence upon the inner surface of the labia majora, and they enlarge gradually as they converge towards each other in front. At the cli- toris, they become slightly contracted, and bifurcate before their termination. I be lower division of the bifurcation is attached to and continuous with the glans of the clitoris; the upper division unites with that of the opposite side, and forms a hood-like fold above that body, called the preputium clitoridis. rhe nymphfE are provided with very large crypts, which are visible to the naked eye, and secrete an abundance of sebaceous matter. They vary much m size, according to age: thus, in new-born infants, they project beyond the labia majora, principally on account of the imperfect developement of the latter. They also vary in different individuals; in some females being extremely small, and in others always projecting beyond the labia majora; and lastly, in different countries; for in certain African nations, among the Hottentots for example, they are of a disproportionate length, and constitute what is called in females of that race the apron. The clitoris is an erectile apparatus, forming a miniature representation of the corpus cavernosum of the penis. Its free extremity is seen in the anterior part of the vulva, about six lines behind the anterior commissure of the labia majora, and resembles a tubercle situated in the median line, covered, as by a hood, with the upper divisions of the bifurcated nymphae, and continuous with the lower divisions of the same. This tubercle, which, though imperforate, has been compared to the glans penis (glans clitoridis), is generally very small. Sometimes, however, it is very long, so as to have excited a suspicion of the existence of hermaphrodism. In one instance that came under my observ- ation, the free part of the clitoris was two inches long, and extremely slender. Like the corpus cavernosum in the male, the clitoris arises from the ascend- ing rami of the ischia by two roots, which expand and converge until they arrive opposite the symphysis, where they unite and form a single corpus caver- nosum, flattened on each side ; this, after passing for some lines in front of the symphysis, separates from it, and forming a curve with the convexity directed forwards and upwards, and the concavity downwards and backwards, gradually becomes smaller towards its free extremity. It has a suspensory ligament precisely resembling that of the penis, and ischio-cavernosi muscles, similar to but smaller than those of the male. We have already said that the constrictor vaginae, which represents the bulbo-ca- vernosi of the penis, has a similar arrangement to those muscles, i. e. it passes upon the sides of the clitoris, and then becomes continued on to its suspensory ligament. The last circumstance which completes the analogy between the clitoris and the corpus cavernosum of the penis is the reception of the canal of the urethra into the V-shaped interval formed by the union of the two crura of the clitoris. The corpus cavernosum of the clitoris forms a longitudinal ridge between the labia majora, extending from the anterior commissure to the glans of the clitoris. The meatus urinarius. About an inch below and behind the clitoris, we find in the median line immediately above the projecting margin of the opening of the vagina the meatus urinarius, or the orifice of the urethra, which constantly appears closed. The mucous membrane of the vulva. The mucous membrane lining the vulva is continuous, on the one hand, with the skin at the internal surface of the labia majora, and with the mucous membrane of the vagina on the other ; upon the labia majora and nymphae it has a great number of sebaceous follicles visible to the naked eye, and yielding a cheesy odorous secretion; and also mucous follicles, which are most numerous near the meatus urinarius, and open into culs-de-sae, the orifices of which are visible to the naked eye, and are often large enough to admit the blunt extremity of a probe. Development. In the foetus the labia majora are small, and separated from each other by the nymphaj, which are much larger in proportion, and also byTHE MAMMiE, 629 s 8 3 the clitoris, which projects beyond them to a greater extent in the earlier pe- riods of developement. This predominance of the chtons is still so decided at birth, that it has occasioned mistakes concerning the sex of the mfant. THE MAMMJE. Number. — Situation. — Size. — Form. — Structure. — Development. The viammcB or breasts {tiaarhs, from tii^, to seek eagerly, because the in- fant seeks them for the milk) are glandular appendages of the generative sys- tem, which secrete the milk, and even after birth establish intimate relations between the mother and the infant. The important office performed by the mammse has led zoologists to arrange in the same class, under the term mammalia, all animals having an apparatus for lactation. We may mention here another character peculiar to this class of animals, because it is intimately connected with the existence of mammae, viz. that all mammalia are viviparous, that is to say, give birth to their young freed from all their foetal envelopes. The mammse exist in both sexes, but are rudimentary and atrophied in the male, and belong essentially to the female. Number. They are two in number in the human species, -which is uniparous; in the lower animals they are generally double the number of the young. Ex- amples of three or four mamma; in the human subject are very rare, and the supernumerary mammse are generally nothing more than simple nipples, or rather masses of fat. Situation. They are situated on the anterior and upper part of the chest, the transverse enlargement of which in the human subject is so favourable to their developement. In the lower animals they occupy the abdominal region. They are situated on each side of the median line, over the interval between the third and the seventh ribs. They are therefore placed at the same height as the arms, and occupy this region, says Plutarch, in order that the mother may be able to embrace and support her infant whUe she is suckling it. Size. In the male they are rudimentary during the whole of life; in the female until the period of puberty only, when they become much enlarged as the generative apparatus is developed more completely. They again increase in size during pregnancy, and especially after delivery; they become atrophied in old age. In some females who are still young, the size of the mammse by no means corresponds to their stature, strength, and soundness of constitution ; while, on the other hand, it is not uncommon to see thin, phthisical individuals with very large breasts. In judging of the size of the mammse we must not confound that depending upon the gland itself with that due to fat. The largest breasts are not always those which furnish the most milk, because their ex- treme size often depends on an accumulation of fat, the gland itself being small. The left mamma is almost always a little larger than the right. Form. The mammse represent a semi-sphere surmounted by a large papilla called the nipple. The skin covering the mamma is remarkably delicate. Surrounding the nipple is an areola or aureola of a pinkish hue in young girls, but of a brownish colour in most females who have borne children ; it has also a rough appear- ance owiug to a number of sebaceous glands, which yield a kind of waxy se- cretion that prevents the irritating action of the saliva of the infant. Mor- gagni, Winslow, and Meckel state, that they have observed milk to escape from them ; but if there was no error in their observations, it must be admitted that by some unusual anomaly a lactiferous duct opened at the side of one of these little glands.SPLANCHNOLOGY. 630 The mammilla or nipple is of a pinkish or browD colour, rough, and as it were cracked at the summit, and capable of undergoing a sort of erection ; it varies in form and size in different subjects ; it is either cylindrical or conical, and some- times so short that the lips of the infant cannot lay hold of it; in certain cases it is even depressed. In the centre of the nipple we observe one or more de- pressions, in which the lactiferous ducts open by a variable number of orifices. The papilla is provided also with a great number of sebaceous glands having the appearance of tubercles, and secreting a substance which prevents the nipple from being chapped by the act of sucking and the saliva of the infant.* Structure. The breasts consist of the mammary glandular tissue and of fat. The mammary gland. When freed from the fat by which it is surrounded, the marnmary gland appears like a mass flattened from before backwards, and thicker in the centre than at its circumference, which is irregular but less so on the inside than on the outside. Its base, which is plane, and even slightly concave, rests upon the pectoralis major, and sometimes beyond it upon the serratus magnus ; a continuation of the fascia superficialis separates it from these muscles, to which it adheres by very loose serous cellular tissue only, and hence it is very moveable. The cutaneous surface of the mammary gland is very unequal, and forms alveoli filled by fat, by which means the inequalities are concealed. The proper tissue of the gland is considerably denser than that of most glandular organs. It should be examined both during lactation, and when that function is not being performed. In the absence of lactation the gland has the appearance of a very com- pact, whitish, fibrous tissue, divided into unequal lobes, which cannot be com- pared to any thing better than to certain fibrous tumours of the uterus. The granular structure proper to the tissue of glands is not visible during this state. During lactation the granular structure becomes very evident. The fol- lowing are the results of my observations respecting it at this period : — The glandular granules or lobules are united into small clusters, forming flattened lobes, placed one upon another. From each little lobe proceeds an excretory duct, which may be recognised by its white colour, is easily injected, and is formed by the union of a number of smaller ducts corresponding to the number of lobules. Having had an opportunity of dissecting the mamma of a female recently delivered, in which the cellular tissue between the lobules was infiltrated with serum, the lobules themselves, as it were, dissected, and the lactiferous ducts injected with yellowish coagulated milk, I found that some of the lobules were isolated, and as it were pediculated, whilst others were collected into regular or irregular clusters. In one of these clusters the lobules had a circular arrangement, small ducts proceeded from each lobule, and passing from the circumference towards the centre of the circle like radii, opened into a common efferent duct, which issued from the central point. Another cluster was elongated and swollen at intervals, and in the centre was a duct which received the smaller ducts from the several lobules. Each lo- bule had a central cavity, from which a worm-shaped mass of coagulated caseous matter could be expressed. When examined by the simple micro- scope, the parietes of these cavities had a spongy aspect like the pith of the rush, a character which I have already noticed as belonging to all glandular organs, f Tlie fibrous tissue of the mamma. Besides the lobules, a large quantity of fibrous tissue also enters into the structure of the gland, forms a complete * rSir A. Cooper has described numerous cutaneous papilla; upon the nipple and areola ; they are hiEhly vascular and nervous.

Sometimes ilrergfm^eSttfTe — of puberty is confined entirely to Se fibrouf tLue ; in such a case the organ may acquire an enormous size, the ItndSissue d sappears, and the mamma is transformed mto a many-lobed fihrnus mass which has been sometimes mistaken for a degenerated lipoma. Th!aZos^fsL The alveoli on the outer surface of the mamma are finPd wS masses of fatty tissue, which are separated by fibrous lammsE ex- Sn/f^om the gland to the skin. The ceUs in which these masses are con- a£ do no^comlunicate with each other, and hence the frequency of circum- scribed abscesses in the mamma. The relative quantities of fat and glandular issue have aa inverse ratio to each other. The great size of the mamm^ n some men is owing to developement of the fatty tissue. HaUer says that i is anTsseTal element in the structure of the gland, and that he has several times seen lactiferous ducts arise from it. j • i TL Lci,/aro«. ducts. If the mamma of a female who has died dunng lac- tation be divided, the milk wUl be seen to exude from a number of points, as from the pores of a sponge; these points correspond to sections of the thin, whitish, semi-transparent excretory ducts of the mammary glands which are called lactiferous or galactophorous ducts. They arise from the lobules, and perhaps also from the fatty tissue, as was thought by HaUer *; they unite successively like the veins, converge from the circumference to the centre traverse the substance of the gland, and at length form a variable number of ducts, which reach the centre of the gland, opposite the areola. In that situation they acquire their utmost size, and form considerable ampulla; or dilatations, between which scarcely any intervals are left. According to some anatomists the number of these ampuUse is not less than twenty ; 1 have never counted more than ten. They are of unequal size. At the base of the nipple they become contracted, straight, and parallel, and open upon its sum- mit by orifices, which are much narrower than the ducts themselves. Thus then, although there is no reservoir properly so called in the mammary gland, the ampullce above described may be regarded as such; with this difference only, that instead of one reservoir there are several. The lactiferous ducts, moreover, are surrounded, both in the mammilla and opposite the areola, with a dartoid tissue, the existence of which explains the state of orgasm and erection of the nipple, as well as the expulsion of the milk in a jet when the gland is excited. There is no trace of the cavernous structure described by some anatomists as existing in the nipple. The lacti- ferous ducts do not communicate with each other in any part of their course; neither in their terminating canals, nor in their ampuUaj, nor in their smaller ducts ; this may be proved by mercurial injections, or by filling each duct with a differently coloured injection. The mammary gland, like most others, is therefore divided into a certain number of distinct compartments, which may perform their functions independently of each other. Injections also show that the lactiferous ducts have no valves. Their structure is little known. It is generally admitted that they consist of an internal membrane continuous with the skin, and which must be analogous to the mucous membranes, and of an external fibrous coat, which I am inclined to regard as analogous to the tissue of the dartos. The arteries of the mamma arise from the thoracic, especially that which is called the external mammary, also from the intercostals and the internal mammary. The veins are very large, and of two kinds, subcutaneous and deep; the latter accompany the arteries, the former are visible through the skin. The lymphatics are very numerous, and enter the axillary glands.

T/ie Sub-umbilical portion.—The Supra-umbilical portion General Description and Structure. The peritoneum (■Kepi, around, and r,hw, to extend) is a serous membrane which, on the one hand, lines the abdominal parietes, and on the other invests nearly all the viscera contained in the cavity of the abdomen. As it enters into the formation of almost all the abdominal viscera, it has been already partially examined whilst describing them. It remains for us to demonstrate these parts as a whole, and for this purpose we shall suppose the membrane to commence at one particular point, and shall trace it without in- terruption in a circular course until we again arrive at the point from which we started. The peritoneum is the largest and most compKcated of the serous mem- branes ; It forms, hke all of them, a shut sac, the external surface of which adheres to the parts over which it is reflected, whilst its internal surface is free and smooth. Taking the umbilical region as a point of departure, we shall divide the peritoneum into two portions, a superior, epigastric or supra-umbilical, and an inferior or sub-umbilical portion. The inferior or sub-umbilical portion of the peritoneum. The inferior or sub- umbilical portion, supposed to commence at the umbilicus, lines the whole of the parietes of the abdomen {a, fig. 190.) below that pomt. In so doing it is raised up by the urachus and the two umbilical arteries, or rather by the liga- ments replacing those arteries, so as to form three falciform folds, one median and two lateral, which converge towards their termination at the umbilicus, but diverge in the direction of the bladder; the peritoneum then dips into the pelvis, and covers the fundus, the sides, and the posterior surface of the bladder (6), but to a variable extent, according as that organ is distended or empty. When the bladder is contracted, the peritoneum descends behind the symphysis; * [It has been shown by .Sir A. Cooper, that the- maminary gland of the male has a system of ducts and cells like those of the female gland, but very much smaller.]633 THE PERITONEUM. ■when, on the other hand, it is distended and rises into the abdomen, the peri- ' toneum retires before it, and the bladder then comes into direct contact with the anterior wall of the abdomen, so that it can be reached by the surgeon without wounding the peritoneum. ' From the posterior surface of the blad- der the peritoneum is reflected upon the other pelvic organs, being arranged dif- ferently in the two sexes. In thfe- male it is reflected from the bladder upon the rec- tum, forming two lateral semilunar folds, called the posterior ligaments of the bladder, and a cul-de-sac between them of variable depth, which sometimes reaches as low as the prostate.* In the female it is reflected from the posterior surface of the bladder upon the neck of the uterus (m), forming a cul-de-sac between the two, so that the inferior fundus of the bladder is entirely uncovered by it. It then covers the two surfaces and the superior border of the uterus, and forms two lateral, broad, trans- verse folds (the ligamenta lata), each of which is subdivided superiorly into three smaller folds, the ala vespertilionis or alee of the broad ligament, the anterior fold corresponding with the round ligament, the middle one to the Fallopian tube, and the posterior fold to the ovai'y. The peritoneum has no relation with the front of the vagina (u), but it covers the upper third of that canal behind; from thence it is reflected upon the rectum (r), and has then the same arrangement in both sexes. Inferiorly it is limited to the anterior surface of the gut, but superiorly it entirely surrounds it, excepting behind, where it forms a dupli- cature known as the mesorectum. After leaving the cavity of the pelvis, the peritoneum continues to ascend, so as to cover the posterior wall of the abdomen; in this situation we shall ex- amine it in the middle and at the sides. In the viiddle it passes in front of the sacro-vertebral angle, then in front of the lumbar vertebrae, and having arrived opposite an oblique line, extending from the left side of the second lumbar vertebra to the right iliac fossa, it is reflected forwards to constitute the left layer (jn) of the mesentery (fi4aos, middle, evrepov, an intestine) ; it immediately expands, so as to correspond to the whole length of the small intestine (i), lines the left lateral half, the con- vex borders, and the right lateral half of that intestine, and then passing from before backwards (m') is applied to the back of the layer just described, and in this manner forms the mesentery (m m'), the largest of all the duplicatures of the peritoneum, and remarkable for its resemblance to a plaited ruffle. On the left side the peritoneum, after having formed the viesorectum, then forms the iliac mesocolon, a considerable fold, which allows great mobility to the sigmoid flexure of the colon. From the sigmoid flexure it is prolonged upon the left lumbar colon, covering the anterior five-sixths of that part of tlie intestine, and applying it against the kidney, but without forming any du- * The peritoneum, forming the cul-de-sac between the bladder and the rectum sometlmps had man^^hildrai''''""'^'' '""^ P""*^'"^ "'^ abdomen in women who have634 SPLANCHNOLOGY. plicature for it; so that the kidney and the colon are in immediate relation. Still the left lumhar colon is not unfrequently entirely surrounded by the peritoneum, so as to have a duplicature behind it, caUed the left lumbar meso- colon. Along the whole course of the great intestine, the peritoneum usually forms a number of small folds containing fat, and named the appendices epiploicce. On the right side the peritoneum arrives at the cajcum, and may be arranged in one of two modes; it either entirely invests that portion of intestine, which is then very moveable; or else, and thiis is the most common arrangement, it passes immediately in front of the caacum, which is thus applied against the right iliac fossa, and is attached there by rather loose cellular tissue. The peritoneum sometimes foi-ms a small mesentery for the vermiform appendix, sometimes fixes it against the posterior surface of the caacum, or against the ileum, or lastly against the lower portion of the mesentery. Above the csecum the peritoneum covers the right lumbar colon, and has the same arrangements as on the left side. Such is the course of the sub-umbilical portion of the peritoneum. The superior or supra-umbilical portion of the peritoneum. We shaU trace the superior or supra-umbilical portion from the umbilicus ito the posterior wall of the abdomen, opposite to the mesentery and the lumbar mesocolon, to which points we have already traced the lower portion. Commencing at the umbilicus and proceeding upwards, the peritoneum (e) lines the anterior abdominal parietes ; on the right side it meets with the umbilical vein, or the fibrous cord to which that vein is reduced in the adult, covers it, and forms a falciform duplicature, named the suspensory ligament of the liver, or falx of the umbilical vein; this fold is of a triangular shape, its apex corresponds with the umbilicus, and its base with the upper surface of the liver, which is divided by it into two lateral portions or lobes.* From the umbilicus then, as from a centre, proceed four peritoneal folds, one superior or ascending for the umbilical vein, and three descending, one for the urachus and two for the umbilical arteries. From the anterior waU of the abdomen, the peritoneum is continued upon the lower surface of the diaphragm (/), and is arranged differently on the right and left sides and in the middle. ^ TJie right-or splenic portion. The peritoneum, after having lined the lower surface of the diaphragm as far as the vertebral column, is reflected upon the posterior surface of the vascular pedicle of the spleen, covers the posterior half of the internal surface of that organ, its posterior border, the whole of its ex- ternal surface, the anterior half of its internal surface, and the anterior surface of its vascular pedicle, from which it is prolonged upon the great end of the stomach, and becomes continuous with the anterior layer of the great omentum. The two layers which are applied to each other, one in front of and the other behind the vessels of the spleen, constitute the gastro-splenic omentum. Below the spleen, the peritoneum forms a horizontal fold, or septum, by which that organ is separated from the viscera below it. The middle or gastro-epiploic portion. In the middle the peritoneum lines the lower surface of the diaphragm, as far back as the cardiac extremity of the oesophagus, is reflected over the anterior surface of the stomach (s), and descends into the abdomen in front of the arch of the colon and the convolutions of the small intestine to form the anterior layer (n) of the great omentum. After descending towards the lower part of the abdomen for a distance, which varies in difi'erent individuals and at difi'erent ages, it is folded back- wards upon itself, and passes upwards to form the posterior layer (o) of the qreat omentum. Having arrived at the convex border of the arch of the colon (c) it covers the lower surface of that intestine, and passes horizontally backwards (5) to the anterior surface of the vertebral column, in front of * [Its lower free margin incloses the urafcilical vein, anU its upper or anterior border is at- tacliud to tlie abdomiual parietes.]THE PERITONEUM. 635 which it is again reflected and becomes continuous with the right layer (w ) of the meseSery. The horizontal portion, which extends from the arch ot the colon to the vertebral column, forms the inferior layer (g) of the transverse '"It foUows then, that the portion of the peritoneum which is continuous with that upon the anterior surface of the stomach, forms below that organ a kind of bag, which has a direct or descending layer, and a reflected or ascending layer in the interval between which ai-e placed the stomach (s), the pancreas (p) the duodenum {d), and the arch of the colon (e). We shall afterwards fijad that each of these layers is lined internally by another layer of peritoneum, so that the great omentum consists of four layers of serous membrane. The right or hepatic portion. On the right side the peritoneum is reflected from the diaphragm upon the convex surface of the liver (/), and forms the coronary ligament of the liver (at g), being continuous with the suspensory ligament, the direction of which is at right angles to its own. From the convex sui-face of the liver, the peritoneum is reflected over its anterior margin, and then upon its concave surface, investing the gall bladder, sometimes almost entirely, but generally on its lower surface only. At the transverse fissui-e it is reflected downwards in front of the vessels of the liver, and to the left of those vessels reaches the lesser curvature of the stomach, and is continued upon the anterior surface of that organ. That portion of peri- toneum which extends from the transverse fissure to the lesser curvature of the stomach, constitutes the anterior layer (Ji) of the gastro-hepatic or lesser omen- tum. To the right of the vessels of the liver and to the right of the gall bladder, the peritoneum covers the lower surface of this viscus, and becomes directly continuous with the portion which covers the right lumbar colon. As the peritoneum is reflected from the diaphragm upon the right and left extremities of the liver, it forms two folds, one on each side, called the trian- gular ligaments of the liver. The foramen of Winslow and sac of the omentum. Behind the vessels of the liver, and under the anterior root of the lobulus Spigelii, is an opening which leads into a cavity situated behind the stomach and the gastro-hepatic omen- tum. This opening is the orifice of the omental sac, or the foi-amen of Winslow (in which a probe is placed in the figure) ; the cavity is called posterior cavity of the peritoneum, or the sac of the omentum (i.). The foramen of Winslow is semicircular, sometimes triangular in shape, and about one inch in its longest diameter. It is bounded in fi-ont by the vessels of the liver, behind by the vena cava inferior, below by the duodenum, and above by the neck of the gall bladder, or rather by the lobulus caudatus, or anterior root of the lobulus Spigelii, these several parts being covered with peritoneum. Through this opening the peritoneum enters the sort of pouch formed between the two layers of the great omentum. In tracing the course of the reflected portion of the peritoneum, we shall commence at this opening, and shall return without interruption to the same point. The peritoneum is first applied to the posterior surface of the anterior layer of the gastro-hepatic omentum already described, and forms the posterior layer (t) of that omentum; it then covers the posterior surface of the stomach ; below that organ it is applied (a;) to the descending or anterior layer of the great omentum, behind and parallel to which it passes down ; having arrived at the point where the anterior layer of the great omentum is reflected, the layer we are now describing is itself reflected {x) in the same manner, and becomes applied to the anterior surface of the posterior layer of that omentum ; con- tinuing to ascend, it gains the convex border of the transverse colon, covers the upper surface of that intestine, and further back is applied to that layer of the great omentum which is continued over the lower surface of the colon; it thus forms the upper {y) of the two layers, of which the transverse mesocolon IS composed. Having reached the front of the vertebral column it leaves the inferior layer of the transverse mesocolon, covers the anterior surface of the636 SPLANCHNOLOGY. third portion of the duodenum (d), the anterior surface of the pancreas (p) the lobulus Spigehi and the anterior part of the vena cava, and arrives at the transverse fissure of the liver, opposite the foramen from which we began to trace it. ° It follows, therefore, that the great omentum, notwithstanding its thinness and transparency, consists of four perfectly distinct layers, two of which united together in front and two behind constitute the parietes of a cavity called the posterior cavity of the peritoneum, or the sac of the omentum. We may, however, describe the omentum in a different mode, as follows : Two layers of peritoneum applied to each other pass off from the transverse fis- sure of the liver, separate along the lesser curvature of the stomach in order to inclose that organ, again unite along its greater curvature, then pass down- wards, and, opposite the brim of the pelvis, are reflected backwards upon them- selves, and proceed upwards. Having reached the convex border of the colon, they separate to receive that intestine between them, become re-united at its concave border to form the transverse mesocolon, and then separate finally. The inferior layer is reflected downwards to become continuous with the right layer of the mesentery ; the superior is reflected upwards to cover the third portion of the duodenum, the pancreas, and the lobulus Spigelii, and then be- comes continuous with the rest of the peritoneum at the foramen of Winslow.* General description of the peritoneum. From the preceding description it follows that the peritoneum forms a continuous membrane, so that if it were possible to unfold all its duplicatures, and to detach it entire from the surface of all the organs covered by it, it would form a large membranous sac without an opening. Nevertheless, in the female, there is a remarkable interruption at the point corresponding to the free extremity of the Fallopian tube ; in which situation we find the only example in the body, of a serous and mucous mem- brane being continuous with each other. The peritoneum has two surfaces, an external and an internal. The internal surface is free, smooth, and moist, and is the seat of an exhalant and absorbent process, which in the natural condition exactly counterbalance one another. The external or adherent surface lines the parietes of the abdominal cavity, covers most of the abdominal viscera, of which it forms the external or common coat, and is in contact with itself in the different folds formed by the perito- neum. The attachment of this surface is effected by means of cellular tissue, the character of which varies in different situations. We shall examine the external surface of the portion of the peritoneum applied to the abdominal parietes, or the parietal peritoneum; of that upon the viscera, or the visceral peritoneum; and also of that forming the different folds. The parietal portion of the peritoneum. Upon the diaphragm it is attached by a very dense cellular tissue ; nevertheless, it may be torn off in dissecting that part. Upon the anterior wall of the abdomen it adheres most strongly oppo- site the linea alba and the sheath of the rectus muscle, and more loosely op- posite the crural arches than in any other part. Still it is not very difficult to separate the whole of the membrane corresponding to the parietes of the abdomen. In the lumbar region the adhesion is extremely loose, and also in the iliac fossse on the front of the vertebral column : the same is the case in the cavity of the pelvis. The cellular tissue on the outside of the peritoneum, which most anatomists have regarded as forming the external tissue of that membrane, sends pro- longations through the numerous openings with which the walls of the abdomen are perforated. These prolongations connect the sub-peritoneal cellular tissue with that of the lower extremities on the one hand, and with the cellular tissue external to the pleura on the other. The peritoneum is supported throughout » In many subjects the existence of the sac of the omentum may he demonstrated bj; intro- ducing a l^/ge citheter into the foramen of Winslow, and hy blowing carefully through it; the air v"ll enter between the two anterior and the two posterior layers of the ef<^ato™f"^"^ form a large and more or less regular bladder.

The visceral portion of the peritoneum. Among the viscera of the abdomen some receive a complete investment from the peritoneum, always excepting the point at which their vessels reach them; to this class belong the spleen, the stomach, and the small intestines. Others have a less complete covering, so that a portion of their surface is in immediate relation with surrounding parts: of this number are the ascending and descending colon and the caicum. Lastly, others have only very slight relations with the peritoneum, which merely pass over them, and do not appear to enter into their formation : to this class belong the bladder, the lower part of the rectum, the pancreas, the two lower portions of the duodenum and the kidneys. To the last named organs the peritoneum is connected only by very loose cellular tissue. The visceral portion of the peritoneum is not strengthened by the fibrous layer met with in its parietal portion, and therefore, perforation of the serous coat of the viscera is much more common than perforation of the parietal portion of the serous membrane. The folds of the peritoneum. Among the folds of the peritoneum, most of which have been already described, and which need be only recapitulated here, some bear the name of ligaments, viz. the triangular, coronary, and falciform ligaments of the liver, the posterior ligaments of the bladder, and the broad ligaments of the uterus. Others are called mesenteries, viz. the mesentery properly so called, or the mesentery of the small intestine, the transverse mesocolon, the right and left lumbar mesocolon when they exist, the iliac mesocolon, and the mesorectum. With these we should include the duplicature extending from the transverse fissui-e of the liver to the lower curvature of the stomach, and known as the lesser omentum ; it really constitutes the mesogastrium. Lastly, there are certain folds, named omenta or epiploa (eTrl, upon, irAe'ai, to float), viz. the great or gastro-colic, small or gastro-hepatic, gastro-splenic, and colic omenta.* With this class we may connect the appendices epiploicaj. It may be well to make a few observations upon the great and lesser omenta. The great omentum. The great or gastro-colic omentum, so called because it is attached on the one hand to the stomach, and on the other to the colon, scarcely exists in the new-born infant; it is gradually developed as age ad- vances, and about the period of the termination of growth it reaches to the brim of the pelvis. It has been remarked, that it descends a little lower on the left than on the right side. When the stomach and the colon are distended, this omentum is reduced to a, more or less narrow border extending along the arch of the colon. It presents also a number of individual varieties ; sometimes it is vei7 re- gularly suspended in front of the intestinal convolutions ; sometimes it is folded upon itself, and carried to one side or the other; occasionally it ad- heres at some point, becomes stretched like a cord, and may then give rise to strangulation; and lastly, it is not very rare to find it turned upwards and backwards between the diaphragm above, and the stomach and liver below. It is so transparent and thin that it is difiicult to conceive it to be formed of four layers. In some individuals, it is even perforated with holes like a piece of lace. The great omentum is found, in very fat persons, to be loaded with an immense quantity of adipose tissue, deposited chiefly along the vessels; so that it may acquire a very considerable size, and a weight of several pounds. The great omentum has an anterior and posterior surface, both of which are free, an upper adherent border, a lower border, free, convex, and more or less sinuous, which corresponds with the crural arches, and the internal openings of the inguinal canals ; it is, therefore, very often found in hernial sacs. * [The colic omentum consists of two layers of peritoneum, with intermediate veswls inrt f=>f wh>c1. descend, behind the great omentum, from the upper part of the asceSg colon!]SPLANCHNOLOGY. 638 Ihe lower border is more liable to adhesions than any other part of the omentum. The lateral borders have nothing remarkable; they proceed pa- rallel to the ascending and descending portions of the colon, which are some- times covered by them. The arteries of the great omentum are furnished by the right and left gastro-epiploic arteries, they descend vertically between its two anterior layers, scarcely diminishing in caliber. At its lower border they turn up- wards, and ascend between the two posterior layers as far as the arch of the colon, where they communicate with the arteries of that intestine. The veins follow the same course as the arteries, and assist in forming the vena portaj. Some lymphatic glands are found in the great omentum along the curvatures of the stomach and the arch of the colon. Nerves. Some nervous filaments from the solar plexus can be traced upon the arteries of the omentum; it is doubtless from them that the epiploon de- rives its peculiar sensibility, and on them that the phenomena of strangulation depend when it is constricted in a hernia. The uses of the omentum are not known. The lesser omentum. The lesser omentum, a true mesentery, the meso- gastrium, presents a lower concave border, attached to the lesser curvature of the stomach, and an upper border attached to the transverse fissure of the liver, to that part of the antero-posterior fissure which is behind the transverse fissure, and also to the oesophagus and the diaphragm; its right border con- tains the ducts and vessels of the liver, and behind the border thus formed is seen the foramen of Winslow; on the left it is bounded by the oesophagus.* Structure of the peritoneum. The peritoneum, like all other serous mem- branes, has neither arteries, veins, nor nerves. Those which are contained within the omenta and the mesentery do not properly belong to this mem- brane. The finest capillary injections, either natural or artificial, form an extremely delicate network below the peritoneum, but never penetrate itf * [The cellular tissue surrounding the vessels, ducts, and nerves, contained between the layers of this small omentum, has been described as giving origin to Glisson's capsule.] t [The basis of the peritoneum is cellular tissue; its smooth surface is covered with a squa- mous epithelium.] END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.

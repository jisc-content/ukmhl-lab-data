ARTHROLOGY. 168 ARTICCUiVTIONS OF THE FACE. The articulations of the face comprise those of the upper and of the lower jaw. Articulations of the Bones of the Superior Maxilla with each other, and with the Cranium. All these articulations are sutures, but they have not such large indentations as the bones of the cranium ; almost aU are united by harmoma or ]uxta-po- sition At the same time it should be remarked that a true dovetaihng exists in these articulations, as may be seen in the junction of the superior maxiUary boups (the fundamental articulation of the face), which is effected by means of thick furrowed surfaces, mutually and firmly adapted to eaoh other. No suture in the whole skull is stronger than that between the malar and tbP maxiUarv bones ; indented sutures are most common on the sides of the face The manner in which the vertical portion of the palate bone is re- ceived into the furrow in the opening of the maxiUary smus, affords an Ulus- tratTon of the suture by reception. There are some weU-marked indentations n he articulations of the bones of the face with those of the cramum ; as m the articulation of the nasal bones of the ascending processes of the superior mai and of the malar bones with the frontal; in that of the sphenoid with the'malar bones ; and of the latter with the zygomatic processes of he remooral bones. Simple juxta-position is met with m the junction of the etW d\.?th the roof of the orbit; of the palate bone with the P erygoid pro- ceSs ; and of the vomer with the ethmoid; but there is a mutual reception in t>,o nrtSpuIation of the vomer with the sphenoid. ™ reS to the means of miion, in addition to the firm muon resultmg from Ihe configuration of the articular surfeces, there is also a thin layer of irmSe contS^ous with that which fonned the matrix of the bones, and which is itS afterwards obliterated during the progress of ossification.

Its nerves are very numerous, and form a remarkable plexus —the p/iar!/ngrm/, ^vhich I regard as one of the largest in the body 1 hey are derived from two sources :— 1. from the cerebro-spinal axis, viz the pharyngeal nerve a branch of the pneumogastric, which appears to be princi- pally distributed to the mu.scular layer; the glosso-pharyngeal, which appears to be chiefly destined for the mucous membrane; and lastly, some branches ot the superior laryngeal and the spinal accessory : 2. from the ganglionic system, several large, grey, and soft branches being distributed to it from the superior cervical ganglion. This abundance of nerves, and also the sources from which they are derived will serve to explain, 1. the great sensibility of the pharynx ; to which part we reter the feeling of thirst, which some have, therefore, proposed to term the pharyngeal sense; 2. the part which it performs in the perception of certain flavours, for example, those of acids ; 3. the sympathy between the pharynx, the base ot the tongue, and the stomach ; 4. the feelings of constriction and strangu- lation, so common in the pharynx ; 5. the spasms with which it is affected in tetanus and hydrophobia; and 6. the nature of the globus hystericus, &c.* Developement. The developement of the pharynx offers no remarkable phe- nomena ; still It IS an exception to the general law of bilateral development, laid down by some anatomists. Uses of the pharynx. The pharynx is one of the principal organs of deglu- tition. It serves also for the passage of air in respiration, and as a tube for niodulating the voice. The importance of the pharynx in this last point of view and the influence which its different degrees of shortening and con- striction exercise upon the compass of the voice, do not appear to me to have sufficiently engaged the attention of physiologists. The (Esophagus. The oesophagus (olaai, I will convey, and <pa.yw, I eat) is a musculo-membra- nous canal, an organ of deglutition, intended to convey the food from the pha- rynx into the stomach. It occupies the lower part of the cervical region and all the thoracic region, and perforates the diaphragm in order to terminate in the stomach. Directions. It is situated in the median line, resting against the vertebral column: its general direction is straight, for the food does not remain in it; nevertheless, it presents several slight curves : at its commencement it is ex- actly in the middle line, but inclines somewhat to the left side in the neck ; in the upper part of the thorax it deviates slightly to the right side, then again becomes median, and lastly inclines to the left, where it passes through the diaphragm. The general direction of the oesophagus permits the introduction of straight probangs into the stomach. The inflection which it undergoes at its entrance into the thorax, explains the reason why these instruments are sometimes arrested opposite the first rib. Dimensions. The length of the oesophagus corresponds to the interval the squamous form, and is not ciliated. In tlie Eustachian tube it is also columnar, and pro- vided with cilia, but in the cavity of the tympanum it is squamous, and destitute of those organs.] ... * We cannot explain why the syphilitic virus has so serious a predilection for tnc mucous membrane of the pharynx.

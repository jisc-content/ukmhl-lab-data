MOVEMENTS OF THE LIPS AND FACE. 309 X 3 Its upper fibres form a concaTity above, which partially embraces the great circumference of the lower half of the orbicularis oris. Action. It raises and wrinkles the skin of the chin, and consequently raises the lower lip and projects it forwards. It appears somewhat singular, at first, that an elevator of the lip should be situated below it. General Considerations regarding the Movements of the Lips, and thgse of the Face in general. If we take a general view of the muscles of the face, we shall observe, 1. that no region is provided with so great a number of muscles; 2. that all these muscles are attached to a bone by one extremity, whilst the other is im- planted into the skin, or into other muscles; 3. that the cutaneous portion of these muscles is colourless and non-fasciculated, presenting all the charac- teristics of involuntary muscles *; 4. that those portions which are attached either to the bone or to other muscles have, on the contrary, all the characters of the voluntary muscles. All these'muscles are arranged around the several openings of the face, and consequently they are either constrictors or dilators; the orifice of the mouth, however, is peculiar f in having the greater number of the muscles of the face specially intended for it. Indeed the orbicularis oris, or sphincter of the mouth, is antagonised by the buccinators or transverse dilators; by the proper eleva- tors of the upper lip, and the common elevators of that and the alae of the nose; by the depressors of the lower lip, or quadrati; by the elevators of the angle of the mouth, viz. the canine muscles, the zygomatici majores, and, where they exist, the zygomatici minores, and the two risorii of Santorini; and, lastly, by the depressors of the commissure, or triangulares oris. The lips fulfil a great number of uses, all requiring a considerable degree of mobility. They serve for the prehension of aliments; for suctionj and for • the articulation of sounds,' whence the name labial given to consonants, spe- • cially produced by the action of the lips, as b,p,m: they modify the state of the expired air," so as to produce in it vibrations of a peculiar character, con- • stituting the act of whistling'; and in this respect they illustrate the mecha- nism of the glottis : they assist in mastication' by retaining the food, and con- stantly forcing it between the teeth: they are also employed, during perform- ances upon wind instrumentsi in regulating the volume of the column of air which strikes upon the body to be thrown into vibrations. The mechanism of their action varies according to the kind of instrument: sometimes, for example, they assist in graduating the rapidity of the column of air,'by in- . fluencing the orifice through which it issues, as occurs in playing upon the flute ; and sometimes they represent vibrating cords; situated at the mouth of . an instrument, and determining the different tones by their various degrees of tension. In this case, the lips themselves become the vibrating bodies, and propagate their oscillations to other bodies with which they are in contact, in- * This siinUarity is limited, however, to the colour and general aspect of the two kinds of Ted e?v'srmilIr",o'fhP.ti'nOH''=";S' ^"^"^r" °^'''' ^'"'^ '"'^ f°""<l to consist o^'^.r.d fibresf a^'o™cSc?;^'a'?e^'e\&"evi^'e'nt°J,'o^^^^ -'o "^^^ ^'"^^^^ l'J^'v'"'lu^" animals in the number of muscles attached to his lips.

196 ARTHROLOGY. with very strong ligaments, increases in a remarkable manner the strength of the joint. . . n t.- • Carpo-metacarpal articulation of the thumb. This jomt (m, fig. 73.) which is very distinct and completely separated from all the others, is remarkable, also, for the arrangement of the articular surfaces. There is a mutual jointing be- tween the trapezium, which is concave transversely, and convex from behind forwards; and the first metacarpal bone, which is concave and convex in pre- cisely opposite directions. It is the type of all articulations by mutual reception. The means of union consist of a capsular ligament (s, figs. U&niTo.-), un- perfect on the outside, where its place is occupied occasionally by the tendon of the abductor longus pollicis (extensor ossis metacarpi poUicis): it is much thicker behind than in front, and is sufficiently loose to permit extensive mo- tions in all directions. There is a separate synovial memJrane for this jomt, which is remarkable in respect of its relations: viz, 1. behmd with the ex- tensor muscles of the thumb ; 2. on the outside, with the expanded tendon of the abductor polUcis; 3. on the inside, with the interosseous muscles and the ra^^ artery, where that vessel penetrates into the palm of the hand to form the deep palmar arch; and 4. in front, with the muscles of the ball of the ^^Tarpo-metacarpal articulation of the fifth metacarpal Jone (see fig. 73.)- The articulation of the fifth metacarpal bone with the os unciforme is in man> ™ctT analogous to the preceding; for there is here, also, a sort of mutu^ r cSn betwe'en their corr'espondin'g articular surfaces.

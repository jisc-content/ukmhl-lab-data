DEVELOPMENT OF IJONES. 21 c 3 l,reast-boBe on the other hand, which is stUl ^^^-^^^^fpSie^^^^^ pubis and ilium, which at that part long remain cartilaginous The true law which governs the order of appearance of the points ot ossin destined for a function which must commence from ^l^e/noment of biith are for this nurnose completely ossified: the vertebrfE and bones of the craniuni Spei eLlyrbecare of their use as protecting the spinal ^oyd and bram ; and ufs thus that the pretended correspondence between the rapidity of ossification and proximity to the nervous centres is explained. ■ „ ^-u^ Ifthough s^everal of the bones are completed solely by ^^^f to Drimitive nuclei of ossification, the greater number acquire, in addition to ?h "e principal or essential pieces, complementary points of ossification nam^^ epiphyses. Thus, while in the frontal the two original points of ossificat on Se by their extension for the completion of the bone, the vertebr^ on the other hand, have three primary osseous nuclei, one for the body and two for thelaminffiand processes, and five complementary pieces of ossification, namely, two for the body, and one each for the tips of the spinous and transverse pro- The transition from the stale of cartilage to bone is attended witt the foUowmg phenomena: the cartilage becomes more dense ; its colour is at first a dull white but subsequently changes to deep yellow; smaU irregular cavities are formed in its substance; red vessels show themselves ; a bony point appears m the midst of these vessels, and this bony nucleus is spongy and penetrated with blood. The ossification spreads by Uttle and Uttle, always preceded by a great development of vessels; so that, in attentively examining an ossitymg cartilage, we find first an osseous point, then a red zone, next an opaque layer of cartilage which is permeated by canals, and lastly the remaining cartilage traversed only by a few vascular canals which run towards the point of ossi- fication. Moreover, it is always at some depth within the substance of the cartilage, that the first osseous points appear, and never at the surface. It is only in cases of accidental or diseased ossification, as in the cartilages of the ribs, that it occasionaUy begins at the surface. It is unnecessary to pursue further the immediate process of ossification: nor need we here discuss the purely speculative question, whether the bone is really a new part essentially distinct from the cartilage, which is absorbed and gives place to it, or merely a deposit of earthy phosphate in a cartilaginous tissue. In admitting that ossification is always preceded and accompanied by a great development of vessels, a fact proved incontestably by Haller andBichat, I must nevertheless decidedly dissent from the opinion, that the appearance of blood in a cartilage is a constant indication of approaching ossification; for several cartilages have naturally bloodvessels, as may be seen in the cartilages of the ribs and larynx. The study of the development of the bones does not consist merely in de- termining the number and time of appearance of their points of ossification: it comprehends also the ulterior changes which take place in the osseous system, viz. the union of the primitive points of ossification, and the appearance and junction of the complementary points of ossification. It is to be remarked, that the order of development and union of the points of ossification does not always correspond with that in which they originally appear ; nay, it is often the reverse. Thus the lower epiphysis of the femur is the earliest in appearing, and it is the last in joining ; whilst, on the other hand, the upper end of the radius is one of the latest of the epiphyses in appearing, but is joined to the bone

The third or external Cuneiform Bone Q,figs. 54, and 55.). This bone, which is the third as regards position, and the second in point of size has, like the preceding, the form of a wedge with the base turned up- wards. Its internal surface articulates behind with a corresponding surface on the preceding bone, and in front with the second metatarsal. This last por- tion completes the kind of recess or mortise mto which the head of the second metatarsal bone is receivedits inner side being formed by the first cune J'orm bone and the bottom by the second. The external surface articulates with the cuboid • the posterior surface is continuous with the two lateral ones, and arti- culates with the most external of the three facettes on the scaphoid : the anterior surface \s triangular, and articulates with the end of the third metatarsal bone: the 6ase (fig. 54.) is rough, and forms part of the convexity of the foot: the apex {fig. 55.) is more obtuse than the same part of the second cuneiform bone, and passes considerably below it. Structure of the bones of the tarsus. The bones of the tarsus present the structure common to all short bones, viz. a mass of spongy tissue surrounded by a layer of compact substance. I have remarked, that in some cases of white swelling of the ankle joint, the os calcis contained in its interior a ca- vity analogous to the medullary canal of long bones. This cavity, however, must be looked upon as altogether abnormal. Development of the tarsal bones. "With the exception of the os calcis, which has two osseous germs, all the bones of the tarsus are developed from single points. The os calcis first becomes ossified. A bony nodule appears in the centre of its cartilage, about the middle of the sixth month of foetal life, ac- cording to most osteogonists; in the fifth, or even the fourth month, according to others. It is placed much nearer the anterior than the posterior extremity of the future bone. Another osseous germ is formed in the posterior extre- mity of the OS calcis, from the eighth to the tenth year, and is much thicker at its lower than at its upper part. The astragalus is developed from one point, which appears from the fifth to the sixth month of inra-uterine life. Ac- cording to Bcclard, the cuboid is not ossified until some months after birth ; I have observed the process to be already commenced in a foetus at the full term. Meckel says that it begins after the eighth month of foetal life. Blumenbach, on the contrary, makes the time of its ossification a year and half, or two years after birth; and Albinus, who has been followed in this respect by the generality of anatomists, aflirms that in the foetus at the full period, all the

ARTHROLOGY. 186 which extends from the upper part of the coronoid cavity to the lo^wer part of the coronoid process; the second are transverse, and intersect the first at right angles ; and lastly, the third are obliquely directed downwards and outwards to the annular ligament. * 4. The posterior ligament {d,fig. 72.). The place of the posterior ligament is occupied by the olecranon and the tendon of the triceps. There are some fibres, however, which extend from the external to the internal tuberosity of the humerus, which are in relation with the synovial membrane in front, and the tendon of the triceps behind. The synovial membrane covers the posterior surface of the anterior ligament: from this it is reflected upon the coronoid cavity, covers the olecranon cavity behind, and is prolonged a little between the tendon of the triceps and the back of the humerus. In this place it is widest and most loose. Below, it forms a prolongation which extends into the radio-cubital articulation, covering the whole inner surface of the annular ligament, and forming a circular cul-de-sac below it.f There is some synovial adipose tissue round the points of reflection, and also at the margin of the olecranon cavity. Mechanism of the Humero-cubital Articulation. Extension and flexion, the only motions performed by this joint, are executed by it with remarkable precision and rapidity. The precision of these move- ments depends, 1. upon the exact fitting of the articular surfaces, no articulation so well deserving the name of a hinge-joint; 2. upon the great extent of the transverse diameter, round which the movements of flexion and extension are performed as round an axis; 3. their rapidity depends chiefly on the smallness of the circle to which the curve of the humeral trochlea belongs. 1. Flexion. In this motion, which is very extensive, the raidus and ulna move as a single bone from behind forwards, on the smaU head and trochlea of the humerus. It should be observed that, in this movement, the obliquity of the trochlea from behind forwards, and from without inwards, throws the fore-arm, when bent, in front of the thorax, aud the hand in front of the mouth. This motion is limited by the meeting of the coronoid process with the coro- noid cavity. When this motion is carried to the greatest extent, the upper end of the olecranon descends to the level of the lowest part of the trochlea, and is, consequently, below the line which passes through the two tuberosities, or condyles of the humerus. In this motion, the back part of the trochlea and the olecranal fossa are covered only by the tendon of the triceps, so that in- struments can readily enter the joint at this place. 2 Extension. In this movement the radius and ulna roU backwards upon the humerus. This motion can only be carried so far that the fore-ann and the arm form a right line, for then the upper part of the olecranon comes m con- tact with the bottom of the olecranal fossa. The anterior hgament and the anterior and middle bundles of the internal lateral ligament are put on the stretch and thus concur in limiting the movement of extension. There is no appreciable lateral motion of this joint, the exact fitting of the articular sur- faces effectually preventing it. The Radio-citbital Articulations {figs. 71 to 75.).

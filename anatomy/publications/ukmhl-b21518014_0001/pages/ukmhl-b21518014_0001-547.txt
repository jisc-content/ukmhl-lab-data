The gall bladder {cystis fellea, g,fig. 164.) is the reservoir of the bile. It is situated at the lower surface of the right lobe of the liver, occupying a particular fossa (the fossa of the gall bladder) on the right of the longitudmal fissure from wHch it is separated by the lobulus quadratus. It is held m this place by the peritoneum, which, in "the majority of instances, merely passes below it, but, in others, almost entirely invests it, and thus attaches it to the hyer by a sort of mesentery. In this latter case it is at some distance from the liver, as in certain animals. • j- ^ a Its form is that of a pear, or of a cone with a rounded base; it is directed obUquely, so that its great extremity {g, figs. 155. 161.) looks forwards, downwards, and to the right; and its smaU extremity, backwards, upwards, and to the left side. , . , , ^-u ^ Size. The small size of the gall bladder corresponds with that ot the rest of the excretory apparatus of the bile, and is strongly contrasted with the great bulk of the liver. This difference becomes still more striking if we compare, on the one hand, the kidney with the liver, and, on the other, the urinary bladder with the gall bladder. It is true, however, that aU the urine must pass through the former, while a part only of the bile is deposited in the The size of the gall bladder, however, is subject to considerable variety; it sometimes acquires three, four, or even ten times its usual size from retention of the bile, in consequence of obstruction in the ductus choledochus.* Cases have been recorded in which it contained six, eight, or ten pounds of bile, but this I can scarcely credit. On the other hand, it is sometimes closely con- tracted round a small calculus, whilst the cystic duct is completely obliter- ated, and reduced to a fibrous cord. It must undoubtedly have been such cases as these, that have been regarded as examples of congenital absence of the gall bladder. Relations. In order to facilitate our description, we shall consider the gall bladder as consisting of a body, z. fundus, and a neck. The fiorfy is conical, and has the following relations:—below, where it is covered by the peritoneum, it is in relation with the first portion of the duode- num, and the right extremity of the arch of the colon. It is not unfrequently found in contact with the pylorus, or even with the pyloric end of the stomach. Sometimes it is united by accidental or normal adhesions to the duodenum and arch of the colon. These relations account for the yellow or green discolour- ation which always takes place after death in those parts of the alimentary * Another cause of enlargement of the gull binder is the obstruction of its neck by a cal- culus; but instead of bile, it then contains a limpid serum, and in fact is converted into a serous cyst. The tumour thus formed may be compared to the lachrymal tumour in cases of obstruction of the lachrymal puncta or canals.

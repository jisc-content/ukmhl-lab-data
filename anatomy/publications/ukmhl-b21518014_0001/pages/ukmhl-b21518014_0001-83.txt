THE CRANIUM IN GENERAL. 61 that they are developed in an inverse ratio. One appears to augment a expense of the other. Division of the Cranium., and Description of its different Regions. The cranium considered as one piece presents an '"""'.^^'f^^^^^^^^ an internal or encephaUc surface. Many of the o^-J^^^^^^f ° ?,Xn ' have been already described with the particular bones ^^^^^^^ ^^^n of the these Ave shaU merely point out: others yhich result from the umon ot tne bones in one common whole, will be exammed more m detail. External Surface of the Cranium. The external surface of the cranium offers, for consideration, a superior re°-ion or vault, an inferior, and two lateral regions. _ " The mperior region or vault is bounded by a circular line, passing trom the middle, frontal, or nasal protuberance {glabella), along the temporal fossa, to the external occipital protuberance. It is principaUy covered by the occi- pito-frontalis muscle, and presents in the median Une, 1. the trace of the union of the two primitive halves of the frontal bone: 2. the bi-panetal or sagittal suture (sagitta, an arrow), which forms a right angle in front vyith the fronto- parietal or coronal suture, and terminates behind at the superior angle of the occipito-parietal, or larnbdoidal suture (from the Greek letter lambda) : 3 be- hind this suture, a depression corresponding to the anterior superior angle ot the occipital bone. . . ■ j-rp j. On each side we observe three eminences more or less prominent in difierent individuals, and always most marked in the young. These are the frontal, the parietal, and the superior occipital protu- berances. Between the frontal and parietal protuberances, the coronal suture is situ- ated: and between the parietal and the occipital, we find the lambdoid suture. Be- sides these there are a great number of smaller projections, which Gall has also denominated protwSemnces, and to which much importance is attached in his system. The inferior region or base of the cranium {fig.2\.) is flattened and vei-y irregular. It is bounded behind, by the external occipital protuberance (a) and superior semi-circular line (a h) ; in front, by the glabella or nasal eminence: late- rally, by a line passing over the mastoid and external orbital processes. I shall content myself by describing in this place the posterior half of the base of the cra- nium ; the other half will be included in the description of the face, with the bones of which it concurs in forming the orbital, —nasal, and zygomatic fossa;. The ptery- goid processes below, and the posterior edge of the sphenoid above define the limits of these two portions.

321 THE TRICEPS EXTENSOR CUBITI. The coraco-brachialis (e,figs. 116, 117.) is the smallest muscle of the arm. It is situated at the inner and upper part of the arm, and was confounded by most of the older anatomists with the short head of the biceps, with which indeed it is intimately united at its upper part. Attachments. It arises from the apex of the coracoid process, and is in- serted towai'ds the middle of the internal surface and border of the humerus. It arises from between two tendinous layers, the most superficial of which is common to it and the short head of the biceps, and also from the septum between these two muscles. From this origin the fleshy fibres proceed, forming an elongated, thin, and flat bundle, the size of which is always in an inverse ratio to that of the short head of the biceps; this bundle passes down- wards, backwards, and a little outwards, to be inserted into the humerus, between the brachiaUs anticus and the triceps. Its insertion is efiiected by means of a flat tendon, which receives the fleshy fibres successively upon its edges and external surface, and is accompanied by them even to its attach- ment to the bone. The precise situation of the attachment varies Uke that of the deltoid, and hence the different statements of authors regarding this point. According to Winslow, the coraco-brachialis is inserted at the upper part of the middle third of the humerus; according to M. Boyer, in the middle of the bone; and, according to Bichat, a little above its middle. I have found it inserted at the junction of the lower with the two upper thirds. Relations. It is covered by the deltoid, the pectoralis major, and the biceps, and it covers the sub-scapularis, the latissimus dorsi, and the teres major. Its relations to the axillary and brachial arteries and the median and musculo- cutaneous nerves ai-e the most important. Above, it covers these parts, and then it is in relation with the outer side of the brachial artery and median nerve, so that its tendon alone separates the vessel from the bone. The musculo-cutaneous nerve passes through it; hence the name oiperforatus Casserii has been given to this muscle. It is also very frequently perforated by one of the branches of origin or roots of the median nerve. Action. It carries the arm forwards and inwards, and at the same time elevates it. It co-operates with the anterior fibres of the deltoid, and the superior fibres of the pectoralis major. If the arm be fixed, it depresses the top of the shoulder ; when the arm is carried backwards and turned inwards It draws it forwards again, and rotates it outwards. * ' Posterior Brachial Region.

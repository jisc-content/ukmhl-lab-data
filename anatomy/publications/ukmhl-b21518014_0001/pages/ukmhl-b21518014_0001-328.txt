306 MYOLOGY. Relations. It is situated deeply behind, where it is covered by the ramus of the lower jaw, the masseter, and a small part of the temporal muscle ; from all these parts, however, it is separated by a considerable quantity of adipose tissue, and by a mass of fat which exists even in the most emaciated indivi- duals. More anteriorly it is covered by the zygomaticus major and the zygo- maticus minor, and the risorius of Santorini, where the two latter exist; and at the commissure it is covered by the canine muscle {levator anguli oris) and the trianeularis The Stenonian duct runs along this muscle before passing through it • the buccal nerves and the branches of the transverse facial artery he pa- rallel to its fibres ; the external maxillary (i. e. the facial) artery and vem pass perpendicularly across it near the commissure. A peculiar aponeurosis, called the buccal fascia, is closely united to it, and intervenes between it and all these parts. It covers the mucous membrane of the cheek, from which it is separated bv a dense layer of the buccal mucous glands. , , Action It is the most direct antagonist of the orbicularis. When the cheeks are not distended, its contraction elongates the opening of the mouth trans- verselv, and consequently renders the lips tense, and produces a vertical fold upon the skin of the cheek. This fold becomes permanent in the aged, and constitutes one of their most prominent wrinkles. .i. v • * When the cheeks are distended by air, or any other substance, the buccmator becomes curved instead of flat, and acquires all the properties of the former class of muscles. Thus the first effect of its contraction is, that its fibres be- come straight, or have a tendency to become so; gaseous, hqmd, or sohd Ss, are then expelled from the mouth -rapidly, if the orbicularis offer no obstac e! and gradually, should that muscle contract. The buccmator there- fore fulfils an important office in performances upon wind mstruments ; and hence iS name {blccinare, to sound the trumpet). In mastication i is of no fessTmportance, since it pushes the food between the teeth, and expels it from the sort of groove existing between the cheeks and the alveolar arches.

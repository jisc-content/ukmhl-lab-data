277 THE PSOAS AND ILIACUS. abdomen, wliich affects the viscera of both cavities. The two pillars act like the long muscles; the body of the diaphragm after the manner of the hollow muscles. Wlien the pillars contract, they take their fixed point upon the lumbar vertebrae, and their moveable point upon the notch at the back of the cordiform tendon, which is carried backwards and downwards. This apo- neurosis in its turn becomes a fixed point for aU the other curved radiated fibres that are attached to the ribs. The first eflfect of the contraction of a curved fibre is its becoming straight; and in this process the highest part of the curve is drawn down towards a level with its extremities: the vertical diameter of the thorax is therefore increased, and that of the abdomen propor- tionally diminished; but during contraction, the fibres act equally upon both their points of insertion, and as the cordiform tendon is fixed, and the costal attachments are moveable, the ribs are drawn inwards, and the transverse dia- meter of the thoracico-abdominal cavity thereby diminished. The antero- posterior diameter would be equally diminished, were it not for the inclination of the diaphragm downwards and backwards, in consequence of wliich the ab- dominal viscera are pressed downwards and forwards. Some experimentalists, among whom we may mention Haller and Fontana, have asserted that the diaphragm may become convex below during a forced contraction, but I believe this can only take place when air has been admitted into the cavity of the pleura "We shaU now consider the effects of the contraction of the diaphragm upon the openings by which it is perforated. The elliptical or rather oval opening for the oesophagus, being entirely muscular, is contracted during the action of the diaphragm, in the same manner as the mouth by that of the orbicularis muscle: hence the oesophagus is com- pressed. From this it has been concluded that vomiting cannot take place during inspiration, but experience proves the contrary, vomiting being fa- voured by this compression. It is generally said that the orifice for the vena cava is not affected by the contraction of the diaphragm; but if we draw upon the muscular fibres in the neighbourhood of this opening, we see at once that it is diminished in size ; Haller has even witnessed this in a living animal during inspiration. The arch, or rather the parabolic canal, which gives passage to the aorta, is also contracted, and the vessel slightly compressed; hence doubtless arises the trequency of aneurisms of this artery, where it passes through the pillars of the diaphragm.

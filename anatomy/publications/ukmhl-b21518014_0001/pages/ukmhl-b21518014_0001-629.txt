These lamiuffi radiate, as from a centre, to the entire internal surface of the cylinder, represented by the corpus ca- vernosum. Vessels. The veins of the corpus cavernosum a,re — extremely large, and are divided into the dorsal veins of the penis and the proper veins of the cavernous body ; they all pass beneath the symphysis, and are received into fibrous canals, through which they are transmitted into the pelvis. These veins are provided with a great number of valves, so that injections thrown into the trunks cannot pass into the branches. . , i. . .t. The arteries arise from the internal pudic, and enter the substance ot tne corpus cavernosum. Injection of these arteries does not produce erection until the fluid has passed from them into the veins.* The lymphatic vessels are little known. No nerves have been traced into the interior of the corpus cavernosum. t The triangular suspensonj ligament of the penis. This ligament is composed of yellow elastic tissue, and extends in the median line from the symphysis pubis to the corpus cavernosum. Muscular fibres have been described as existing in it; but it is probable some fibres prolonged from the bulbo-caver- nosus, and now known as the muscle of Houston, have been regarded as forming part of this ligament. I have seen the suspensory ligament reach along the linea alba, half way up to the umbilicus. * [Miiller has described, besides the nutritious arteries of the corpus cavernosum, which ter- minate iis usual in the veins, a peculiar set of vessels, called the arterim helicinte. They are short curled branches, much larger than capillaries, and ending abruptly in free rounded ex- tremities ; they project either singly, or in tufts arising from one stem, rato the venous cells, by the lining membrane of which tliey are supported and invested. They are found princi- pally in the posterior portions of the cavernous and spongy bodies, and are more marked in man than in animals. Tn the horse they are very indistinct; in the elephant they do not exist at all. Miiller believes that the blood, during erection, is poured out directly from these vessels into the venous cells; but no openings through which the blood could escape have been de- tected, either in their sides or at their extremities, nor is .analogy in favour of their existence. According to Valentin, the so-called helicine arteries arc the divided branches of common arteries curled up (after h.iving been injected), in conse(]uenco of the retraction of the elastic trabeculffi on whicli they are supported; to this it is replied, by IMiiller, that these vessels may be seen in cells deeper than the surface of the section. Valentin further maintains that the arteries terminate in the veins by wide funnel-shaped orifices.] t [Numerous nerves enter tlie corpus cavernosum ; thoy are derived from the internal pudic and sympathetic nerves, and have been carefully traced by Miiller.]

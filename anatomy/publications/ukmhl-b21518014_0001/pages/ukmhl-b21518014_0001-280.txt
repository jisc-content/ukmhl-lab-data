The latissimus dorsi adducts the arm, rotates it inwards, and at the same time draws it backwards (hence its name, ani scalptor). When only the upper or horizontal fibres contract the arm is carried inwards and backwards ; when the lower fibres act alone, it is carried downwards. ... , « .1. i .• •„ The uses of the teres riajor are precisely similar to those of the latissimus dorsi, to which it is congenerous and accessory, and with which it is always associated in action, drawing the humerus inwards, backwards, and down- wards When the humerus is the fixed point, the latissimus dorsi raises the trunk' and with the greater facility, because it is attached to the ribs, the s^ine and the pelvis. In consequence of its costal attachments, the latissimus dorsiV a muscle of inspiration; and it should be observed, that the direction of its fibres, which is almost perpendicular to the ribs, enables it to act with great power.

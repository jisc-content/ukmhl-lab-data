282 MYOLOGY. Attachments and direction. It arises from the inner margin and upper sur- face of the first rib near its middle, the point of attachment being indicated by a tubercle, with which it is highly important that we should be acquainted, be- cause it serves as a guide in placing a ligature upon the subclavian artery, which passes over the upper surface of the first rib. It arises by means of a tendon that expands into an aponeurotic cone, from the interior of which the fleshy fibres take their origin. These unite, form the body of the muscle, and proceed upwards and inwards, to be inserted by so many separate tendons into the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the sixth, fifth, fourth, and third cervical vertebrse, and more especially into the notches be- tween the two tubercles at the extremities of these processes. It is not un- common to find one or two fasciculi inserted into the posterior tubercles. Relations. In front and on the outside this muscle is in relation with the clavicle, from which it is separated by the subclavian muscle and vein ; higher up with the sterno-mastoid, the omo-hyoid, the phrenic nerve, and the trans- verse and ascending cervical arteries. Behind, it is separated from the poste- rior scalenus by a triangular space, which is wide below to receive the sub- clavian artery, and narrow above, where it corresponds to the brachial plexus of nerves, by the first two branches of which the muscle is sometimes perfor- ated. On the inside it is separated from the vertebral artery by the longus colli. The relations of the scalenus anticus to the subclavian vein and artery are of the highest importance to the surgeon, and in order to impress them upon the memory I propose to designate it the muscle of the subclavian artery. 1 have seen both the artery and vein placed in front of this muscle. The scalenus posticus {d,figs. 112, 113, and 114.) may be termed the poste- rior long inter-transversalis colli. It is situated behind the preceding muscle, is of the same shape, but somewhat larger. Attachments and direction. It has two perfectly distinct origins; one. ante- rior and larger, from all that part of the first rib intervening between the de- pression for the subclavian artery and the tubercle ; and another, posterior, from the upper edge of the second rib. The latter attachment is sometmies wanting. Proceeding from this double origin, the fleshy fibres form two smaU muscular bodies, which either remain distinct, or become blended to- gether, and pass upwards and inwards, to be inserted by six separate tendons into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the six mfenor cer- vical vertebrEB. It is not uncommon to find a fasciculus extendmg from the second rib to the atlas. _ . .t. v i • „^„v„ Relations. It is separated from the anterior scalenus by the subclavian artery and brachial plexus ; and is in relation, behind, with the cervicahs descendens, transversalis colli, splenius, and levator anguU scapulae : on the outside, with the serratus magnus, the transverse cervical artery, and the sterno-mastoideus: on the inside, with the flrst intercostal, the first rib, the inter-transversales of the neck, and the cervical vertebrae. ■ a a Action The scaleni are powerful flexors of the neck, when their fixed points are below; but when their upper attachments are fixed, they tend to elevate the first rib, and in a slight degree the second also.

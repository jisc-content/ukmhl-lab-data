MYOLOGY. 292 Fig. 113, ehette, and is inserted into the mastoid process and the superior semicircular line of the occipital hone. The sternal origin consists of a tendon prolonged for a considerahle distance in front of the fleshy fihres. The clavicular origin consists of very distinct parallel ten- dinous fihres, attached to the inner side of the anterior edge, and upper surface of the clavicle, to a very variable extent, an important fact in surgical anatomy. There is often a considerable cellular interval be- tween these two origins: sometimes ■d this interval scarcely exists, but in all cases the two portions of the muscle can be readily separated. From this double origin the fleshy fibres proceed, forming two large bundles which remain distinct for some time. Many anatomists there- fore, Albinus in particular, have considered it as consisting of two separate muscles, which they de- scribe as the sterno-mastoid, and the cleido-mastoid; a division that is sanctioned by the comparative ana- tomy of this muscle. The sternal portion of the muscle is the larger, and passes upwards and outwards; the clavicular portion proceeds al- most vertically upwards, behind the other, and is entirely concealed by it at the middle of the neck; the two portions still remain separate, although approximated; ultimately they be- come united, and are inserted into the apex and anterior sui-lace of the mastoid process by a very strong tendon, which runs for some distance along the anterior border of the muscle, and also into the two external thirds ot the superior semicircular line of the occipital bone, by a thm aponeurosis, ibe direction or axis of the sterno-mastoid passes obliquely upwards, backwards, and outwards. ^ /. • i The relations of this muscle are very important. Its superficial or external surface is covered by the skin and platysma, from which it is separated by the external iugular vein, and the branches of nerves, constituting what is im- properly termed the Superficial cervical plexus. Its deep or f^r f surface covers —1. the sterno-clavicular articulation; 2. aU the muscles of the sub- hyoid region, and also the splenius,the levator anguli scapulae, the digastricus and theialeni; 3. the accessory nerve of Willis, which crosses ^fneath its sunerior third, the pneumo-gastric nerve, the great sympathetic, the loop ot hrhypoglossal nerve, and the cervical nerves ; 4. the mternal iYZ^'Z' 5 the lower portion of the common carotid artery. Its anterim- i^'-f/ FO" duces a ridffe under the skin, which it is important to study, because the first iSons for ligature of the common carotid, and for <BSophagotomy should be f oT.;rr ;t The narotid gland rests upon the upper part of this border, wSh s seVa^ated fX^^^ border of the muscle of the opposite L . tr^nnsrul^^^^ of which the apex is below, and the base above, side by '^^"P^^g^'f'!^rthe anterior lunits of the lateral triangle of the neck. ^l^^lTo^:£llSl^^^^^^ niargin of the trapezius, and below tln!^^%\en the sterno-cleido-mastoid of one side acts alone, it flexes the

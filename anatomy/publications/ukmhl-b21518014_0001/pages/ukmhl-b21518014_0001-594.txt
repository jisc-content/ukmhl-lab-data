The grooves are lined by a closely adherent mucous membrane ; and it should be observed that the/exist only on a level with the arytenoid cartilages, and consequently in this region alone is the larynx protected by the thyroid cartilage, the posterior borders of which rest upon the vertebral column. The back of the cricoid cartilage is on a level v^itXafcXm':^^^ °' ^-^^ "P- The internal surface of the larynx. The internal surface of the larynx does not correspond either m shape or dimensions with its outer surface; and this depends principally on the fact, that the retreating angle of the thyroid is the only part of that cartilage which enters into the formation of the laryngeal cavity, the lateral lamina; being altogether unconcerned in it. Cylindrical below, where it is formed by the cricoid cartUage, the cavity ot the larynx is prismatic and triangular above, where it is constituted by the epiglottis in front, the arytenoid cartilages and the arytenoid muscle behind and on the sides by the two mucous folds which extend from the margins of the epiglottis to the arytenoid cartilages. The dimensions of the lower of these two portions of the laryngeal cavity undergo no change, always remaining the same as those of the cricoid cartilage; while the upper, on the contrary, which is broadest in front, varies much in size in consequence of the mobility of the epiglottis and the arytenoid cartilages. Between these two portions, and about the middle of the larynx, a fissure exists, which is narrower than the rest of the cavity, and oblong from before backwards; this is the glottis, or vocal apparatus properly so called. It can be seen without any dissection, by looking down into the larynx (fg. 178.), and requires a very particular de- scription. The glottis, or vocal apparatus. The glottis (yXwrrh, from yAda-rrii, the tongue), frequently confounded with the superior orifice of the larynx*, is a triangular p. ,.g opening or fissure (o,fig. 178.) (rima), elongated from be- s ■ fore backwards, and included between the vocal cords of the right and left sides. It represents two isosceles tri- angles, placed one above the other, and having perfectly equal borders, the base of each being directed backwards, and its apex forwards. The lower isosceles triangle is formed by the inferior vocal cords (r), and the upper one by the superior vocal cords (s). The inferior vocal cords are situated nearer to the axis of the larynx than the superior, so that a vertical plane let faU from the latter would leave the inferior vocal cords on its inner side, p Many authors limit the term glottis to the lower triangle. This view is supported by the absence of the superior vocal cords in a great number of animals, the ox in particular. * This error is perhaps to be attributed to the use of the word epiglottis, so much do words influence our ideas. It was committed even in Haller's time, who says, "Etiam hoc (lart/nfiis) ostium non bene pro glotlidc sumitur."

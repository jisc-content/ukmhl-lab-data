18 OSTEOLOGY. ture of bones applies ia strictness only to those of the adult, because the younger the subject, the less are the cells of the spongy tissue developed. And m hke manner as the walls of the cylinder of long bones diminish in thickness, and the medullary cavity increases in diameter in the aged, so by the progress of age the walls of the cells become extremely thin, and the eel s theinselves very large. In some cases of disease, for example after white swelhng of the ankle- joint, I have observed true medullary canals in the cuboid bone and calcaneum; and I have remarked in one case of cancer of the breast, that the ribs adjoining Ae tum Jur were hollowed out by a sort of medullary canal. It is to this dimi- nution of the osseous substance, this kind of atrophy ot the bone, that I am Sosed to attribute the fragiUty so often observed m the whole osseous system " h7:i7co%7:uLof bones. The bony tissue consists essentially of two dis- tinct eTements, one inorganic, the other orga^dsed. When a bone is su^,ected to tie acTou of dilute nitric acid, the salts are removed, f ^-^f'^'^"^ A/'^^^l^.^f^ eliVic Uke cartilage, and though retaining its original bulk and form, it is found to have lost a great part of its weight. By this process its saline m- Sents Save be n dissolved, and nothing remains but its organic constituents, ^ ir^fint^nhiected to boiling, present all the characters of gelatine.

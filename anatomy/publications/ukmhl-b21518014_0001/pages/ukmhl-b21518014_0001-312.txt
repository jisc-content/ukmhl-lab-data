290 MYOLOGY. the external surface of the thorax. Like them it is serrated. It arises from the sides of the posterior surface of the sternum from the ensiform cartilage and the inner ends of the cartilages of the ribs. From this origin the fleshy fibres proceed, dividing into three, four, five, and sometimes six digitations, which are inserted by tendinous fibres into the posterior surface and borders of the sixth, fifth, fourth, third, sometimes of the second, and even of the first costal cartilages. The lower fibres pass horizontally and parallel to the upper fibres of the transversalis with which they are continuous. The succeeding fibres are directed upwards and outwards, proceeding more and more obliquely up- wards : hence the triangular shape of the muscle, to which its name refers. Relations. It is covered by the sternum, the internal intercostal muscles, and the costal cartilages, from which it is separated by the mammary vessels and some lymphatic glands; it is lined internally by the pleura, and rests upon the diaphragm below. . v i. • • _* i Its use is evidently to depress the costal cartilages mto which it is inserted, or to oppose their elevation. Remarks concerning the intercostal muscles. The muscles we have just de- scribed viz. the intercostals and their accessories, are essential elements in the construction of the chest; they are found in all animals possessed of a thorax Their use is to dilate and contract this cavity m its antero-posterior and transverse diameters. The first rib, being fixed by the contraction of the scaleni, serves as a fulcrum for the agents of inspiration; and the last nb, when fixed by the quadratus lumborum, serves the same purpose for those ot ex- piration; so that these muscles, whose most common action 15 to inchne to one side the neck.and the loins, do not, on that account, act the less upon the ribs. I cannot, by any means, agree with Winslow, who demes that the scaleni have Ly action upo/the ribs ^and maintains that the articulation of the with the first dorsal vertebra, is intended for the movement of the vertebra on the rib, not for that of the rib on the vertebra.

Stretch the muscle by inclining the head backwards and placing a block under the shoulders of the subject; make a horizontal incision through the skin from the angle of the jaw to the symphysis menti, another from the svmphysis to the inner end of the clavicle, and a third along the clavicle. ¥heKdsions should be very superficial, scarcely dividing the ent-e thick- ness of the skin. The muscle must be very cautiously dissected by taking care to commence at its upper part, to turn the edge of the scalpel towards the skin 3 to follow exactly the direction of the fleshy fibres which pass called Ze,eaW by Winslow, Missim^ 77- w AlWnns IS a broad, very thm, and irregularly quadrdateral muscle [i lhf Sat L forepart of tL neck, and adhlrmg to it Uke the cutaneous Sef f the lower animal^^^^^^^ r baL'oflh? otTSw^ the lips, upon the thus, — at tie Dase 01 j .^^ ^^^^^ attachment, which masseter muscle, f °Vs the shoulder, and loses itself in the sub- is ahnost -1-^yf^Folonged as f^ as J^e shoui , ^ . cutaneous cellular •^^nli wWch they form are separated from each other, P'^^wfst^eSni^^^^^ f---'^ '''' and so™«J^i^^t/'^^°S'^;°le in the following manner above:-the posterior it-e^tsttLirS oVtt face nJr the masseter muscle, the lower

212 ARTHROLOGY. 10 the inner side of the patella, and to the internal surface of the tibia, formed by one of the insertions of the vastus internus ; 3. a proper ligament of the patella (/), extending from the external condyle of the femur to the outer edge of this bone. 4. To these may be added the femoral aponeurosis, which is prolonged around the entire joint; an expansion of the aponeurosis of the vastus internus that covers the patella; and, lastly, a thin layer of fibrous tissue belonging to the synovial membrane Mechanism of the Femoro-tibial Articulation. ■ 1. With regard to strength. The strength of articulations is generally in direct proportion to the extent of the articular surfaces, and there is no jomt more advantageously constructed in this respect than the one we have been examining. The reception of the spine of the tibia into the inter-condyloid fossa also tends greatly to increase the strength of the joint, although it forms hut an imperfect kind of dove-tailing. A third and last condition conducive to strength is the multiplicity of the ligaments. 2. With regard to mobility. The knee being a hmge-jomt has two principal movements, in opposite directions, viz./erioreand extension; but as the mutual reception of the surfaces is very imperfect, it is also capable of some slight rotatory motions. Inflexion, the sui-faces of the tibia, defended by their mter-artieular carti- laa-es, glide backwards upon the condyles of the femur: and from the great extent of the articular surfaces of the last bone in that direction, the move- ment can be carried so far as to permit the leg and thigh to touch. In this movement, the lateral, the posterior, and the crucial hgaments are relaxed ; the ligamentum patella is stretched; the patella is firmly applied to the front of the joint, and can neither be moved to the right nor to the left, as may be done during extension. In the position of flexion, the patella fiUs up, as it were, the great hiatus then existing at the front of the jomt between the femur and the tibia. Luxation is impossible during this movement, which is only limited by the mutual contact of the leg and the thigh. _ In extension, the tibia and the inter-articular cartilages ghde m the opposite direction. The movement is arrested when the leg is m the same Ime as the thiffh, and whatever muscular effort be then made, the leg can never pass that limit, excepting from malformation of the parts. A greater amourit of extension is renderfd impossible, both by the shape of the articular surfaces and by the stretching of all the U^aments, excepting that of the Pf'J^ ^^",^1 is completely relaxed, and permits of a great lateral mobility of that bone ^e circumstance in the shape of the articular surfaces, opposed to any extens on beyond the straight Une, is the smaU extent of the trochlea in front; for could such extension lake place, the glenoid cavities of the tibia would then be awHed to a portion of the trochlea, much smaller than themselves.

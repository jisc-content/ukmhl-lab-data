8 OSTEOLOGY. of the parts of tLe skeleton, have tended not a little to increase the confusion, because many of them have made no distinction between bones, properly so called, and pieces of ossification. All doubt, however, in this respect will cease.'provided we consider as distinct bones only those portions of the ske- leton,' which are separable at the time of complete development. The time at which the osseous system arrives at its perfect development, is between the twenty-fifth and thirtieth year. According to these views, we may count in the human body 198 bones, viz.

The chief points embraced by detailed descriptions of a bone are, 1. Its name; 2. Its general BiTuation : /.Its direction ; 4. Its bulk and weight; 5. Its figm-e ; 6. Its regions; 7 iSTnternal conformation ; 8. Its intimate texture , 9. Its development. Nomenclature Osteological nomenclature has many imperfections.

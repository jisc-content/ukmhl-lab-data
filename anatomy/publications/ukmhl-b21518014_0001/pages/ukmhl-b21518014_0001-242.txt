220 ARTHROLOGY. articulations by mutual reception, and of which we have found examples in the sterno-clavicular joint, and the carpo-metacarpal articulation of the thumb. Articular surfaces (2,fg. 80.). The facette of the os calcis is conca-ve from above downwards, while the surface of the cuboid is concave transversely, that is, in a direction at right angles to that of the former. At the lower part of the facette of the os calcis there is a horizontal projection, which some- times stops the knife during the disarticulation of the two rows. The means of union consist of three ligaments; an inferior or plantar, an internal and a superior. The inferior plantar, or calcaneo-cuboid ligament digamentum longum plantse, c d,figs. 82. and 84.), is the strongest of all the tarsal ligaments, forming a broad band of pearly white fibres, directed froni before backwards. These fibres constitute a very thick bundle, and extend from all the under sui-face of the os calcis, excepting the posterior tuberosities, to the posterior margin of the groove of the cuboid. If the fibres of this h- cament be removed layer by layer, we soon arrive at a more deeply seated Lament, separated from the first by some fatty tissue: it extends obliquely inwards from a tuberosity at the fore part of the under surface of the os calcis, to aU that portion of the inferior surface of the cuboid, situated behind its groove. There are, therefore, two inferior calcaneo-cuboid ligaments ; a deep fc"), and a superficial (d). . , , . The internal calcaneo-cuboid ligament (n,Jig. 83.) is short, narrow, quadri- lateral and very strong; it is placed at the side of the superior calcaneo- scaphJid ligament, in the deep excavation between the astragalus and the os calcis These two Ugaments are separated in front, but blended together be- hind,'so as to resemble the letter Y. They may be considered as m some measure forming the key of the articulation of the two rows of tarsal bones ; for during disarticulation the articular surfaces are easily separated as soon as '^Vel^ertfcalcaneo-cuboid ligament (p,fig. 83 ) is only a vc^tWu small band of fibres, extending directly forwards, from the os calcis to the cuboid.

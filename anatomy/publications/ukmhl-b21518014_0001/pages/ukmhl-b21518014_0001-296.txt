MYOLOGY. 274 of the obliqui and transversalis muscles, and rests upon the rectus. The lower part of the rectus and the pyramidalis are united together. When the latter is wanting, the lower end of the rectus is proportionally increased in size, and vice versa. There are sometimes two p3Tamidales on one side, and one ou the other ; sometimes the two are of unequal size. In a negro I found them extending beyond the middle of the space between the pubis and the umbilicus. Action. It is a tensor of the linea alba. DIAPHRAGMATIC REGION. 77*6 Diaphragm. Dissection. — IJescription. — Attachments. — Relations. — Action. Dissection. In order to expose this muscle, it is necessary to open the ab- domen and remove all the abdominal viscera, taking great care in detaching the liver, stomach, and kidneys. Tie the oesophagus and vena cava where they pass through the diaphragm, and cut them below the ligature. Raise the peritoneum with the fingers or forceps, and tear it gently away; thus ex- posing the lower surface of the muscle without using the scalpel. All the insertions of the diaphragm are well seen on this surface. In order to study the convex surface of the muscle, another subject should be provided, and the thorax opened before the abdomen. This is the only method by which a good idea of it can be obtained; for when the abdomen has been previously opened, the muscle becomes relaxed as soon as the thorax is cut into, and affords no idea of its naturally vaulted* form. The diaphragm (septumtransversum, aa,Jig.\\\.'), which exists mmammalia onlv, is, according to the expression of ■ " Hailer, with the exception of the heart, the most important muscle of the body. It is a muscular septum, situated obliquely -a, at the junction of the upper with the two lower thirds of the trunk. It separates the thorax from the abdomen, constitut- ing the floor of the former and the roof of the latter. AU other muscles are placed on the outside of, or around, the levers which they are intended to move; but the diaphragm alone is situated within those levers, like the muscles of animals having an external skeleton. The diaphragm divides the body into two unequal parts, an upper, or supra-dia- phragmatic, and a lower, or infra-dia- phragmatic. It is placed on the median line, but is not symmetrical. It is ellip- tical in form, its longest diameter bemg from side to side, thin and flattened, and resembles an arch, or rather a fan, the , broad and circular portion of which is ■ • .,1 whikt the narrow part is vertical, and at right angles to the former nonzontal, whilst tne nariow Pj^'^ . . portions ; the upper, or great The older anatomists, therefore, divided it diaphragm , muscle of the diaphragm, ^-^^'^^^ yi^lnZ^^ egion o^f the vertebr^ column, Attachments.

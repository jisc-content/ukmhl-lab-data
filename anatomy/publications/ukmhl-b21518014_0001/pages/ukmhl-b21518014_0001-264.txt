£42 ODONTOLOGY. The greatest irregularity exists in the eruption of this last molar tooth, -which is often wanting, and frequently remains, durmg the whole of hfe, either partiaUy or entirely inclosed within the substance of the jaw. The incisor and canine teeth of the second set are much larger than the corresponding milk teeth. The opposite is the case with regard to the first two permanent molars, viz. the small molars, or bicuspides. It was ascer- tained by the inquiries of Hunter that, in this way, there is such a compen- sation, that the t-^enty teeth of the first set occupy precisely the same space as he twenty corresponding teeth of the second. This is not a purely specu- lative question, but one of singular interest in relation to the practice of ex- tSnff the milk teeth. The truth of Hnnter's assertion may be confirmed by measuring with a thread the space occupied by the twenty temporary teeth, Tnd cwring it with the space occupied by the corresponding teeth of he second set. M. Delabarre has done this upon the same mdividual at the '''''^JlV^Lt^^^'ike eruption of the permanent teeth. These relate, 1 to their growth; 2. to their decadence. ^ SJh of the teeth.

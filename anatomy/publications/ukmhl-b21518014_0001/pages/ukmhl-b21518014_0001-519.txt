THE INTESTINES. 497 bladder opening into the colon; with the stomach («), which projects in front of it when distended, but is separated from it by a considerable interval when empty; and lastly, with the lower extremity of the spleen. (Jt) The two an- terior layers of the great omentum, which proceed from the greater curvature of the stomach, pass over the arch of the colon without adhering to it. I have seen a large loop of the arch of the colon interposed between the liver and the diaphragm. Below, the arch of the colon corresponds to the convolutions of the small intestine (^fig. 155.). In front, it corresponds to the parietes of the abdomen, beneath which it may sometimes be felt when distended with gas. It is separated from them by the two anterior layers of the great omentum. The two posterior layers of the great omentum are given off from the middle of its anterior border. Behind, it gives attachment to the transverse meso- colon. The descending or left lumbar colon. The descending colon (d,figs. 155. 161.) so closely resembles the ascending portion, both in situation and relations, that we can only refer to what has been already stated. We must observe, however, that it is more deeply situated above than the ascending colon, and that it is of less size. Advantage has been taken of its immediate relations behind, with the quadratns lumborum, in the operation for artificial anus in cases of imperforate rectum. It is preferred for this purpose to the ascending colon, simply from its proximity to the anus. The iliac portion, or sigmoid flexure, of the colon. The sigmoid flexure of the colon (/, fgs. 155. 161.) is situated in the left iliac fossa, and is continuous below with the rectum. The line of demarcation between it and the descend- ing colon IS determined by the commencement of a fold of peritoneum, called the iliac mesocolon, or rather by the change in the direction of the large in- testine, as it appears to detach itself from the parietes of the abdomen, oppo- site the crest of the ilium. It is continuous with the rectum at the point where it dips mto the pelvis, opposite the left sacro-iliac symphysis. But as It often happens that the lower portion, or even the whole, of the sigmoid flexure is contained in the cavity of the pelvis, it may be understood that such a defanition is not precise. It is retained in its place by a very loose fold of peritoneum, called the iliac mesocolon, and therefore, in some measure, partakes of the mobility of the small intestine. It has been found in almost aU the regions of the abdomen, but especially m the sub-umbilical zone. It has been seen in the umbilical region Its first curvature reaching even to the liver.

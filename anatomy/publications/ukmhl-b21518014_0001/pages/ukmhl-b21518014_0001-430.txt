APONEUROLOGY. 408 rosis of insertion, and a sheatb for the vastus internus: it extends from the an- terior inter-trochanteric line to the inner condyle of the femur. Its anterior surface affords attachments to the vastus internus, throughout its whole extent: its posterior surface is in opposition with the adductors, and is intimately united to their aponeuroses. Its outer margin is attached to the linea aspera: its inner margin is very thick, and prominent below, where it is strengthened by the inferior tendon of the adductor magnus, and may be felt under the skin like a cord. It appears to become continuous below with the internal lateral ligament of the knee. It is composed of very strong vertical fasciculi, passing somewhat obliquely downwards and inwards. These fasciculi are bound together above the inner condyle by others passing transversely, and are crossed almost at right angles by the tendinous fibres of the adductors. Lastly, the internal septum is perforated, near the linea aspera, by a number of orifices destined for the passage of vessels, and forming communications between the anterior and the internal sheath of the muscles of the thigh. The external intermuscular septum. This serves as a septum, an aponeurosis of insertion, and as a sheath for the vastus externus. It extends from the great trochanter to the external condyle, above which it forms a projecting cord: it afiords attachments to the vastus externus ia front, and to the short head of the biceps behind. Its inner margin is attached to the linea aspera: its outer margin forms a prominent cord, especially belov. It consists of fibres directed vertically, or somewhat obliquely outwards, and strengthened by transverse fibres above the condyle. Like the interral septum it is perforated, especially above and below: above, for the passage of the circumflex vessels ; below, for the passage of the articular vessels of the knee. We shall now examine the different sheaths furnished by the femoral apo- neurosis. One of the most important of these is, as it were, hollowed out of -he sides of the others, and belongs to the femoral vessels. The Sheath of the Femoral Vessels. The femoral artery (z, fig. 137.) and vein (y) are inclosed in a prismatic and triangular tendinous canal, which protects them in their course amidst ihe muscles of the thigh. The portion of the canal (laid open m fig. 137.), included between the femoral arch and the point where the vena saphena opens into the femoral vein, has received the name of the crural canal, a term to which t have always objected, since it was first introduced into anatomical nomencla- ture because it establishes a false analogy between the inguinal canal and this upper portion of the sheath of the femoral vessels; for, while an obhque mgmnal hernia traverses the entire length of the inguinal canal, crural herniae, as far at least as my own observation extends, never protrude through the saphenous opening, but escape immediately below the femoral arch, and bit up the cribri- form portion of the fascia lata.* , ■ r j v „o The anterior wall of the sheath of the femoral vessels is formed above by the ci'br^orm portion of the femoral fascia ig;fig. 137 ), then by the tascia itself! and lastly by the posterior layer of the sheath of the sartorius, m which ^^TL^iSlVi^fr:?above by the very strong layer cohering the pectineus, below by the weaker layer investing the adductors. „. , ,:„„.• u in this country, commonly limited to tlie space (r, &. 13C.), ■« [The term ^rura rmg .s m th s ^oum y, ^^^j., y generally uncTerstood situated interna ly ^Xd by M.

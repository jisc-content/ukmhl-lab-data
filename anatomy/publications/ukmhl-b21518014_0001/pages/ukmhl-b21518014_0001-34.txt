When the borders give insertion to a great number of muscles, it has been deemed advisable to divide these into three parts or parallel lines : the middle is then called the interstice, and the two lateral are named lips, the internal and external lip; the superior border of the haunch bone, and the linea aspera of the femur are examples. Eminences and cavities of bones. The bones present certain emmences and cavities, of which it is proper to take a general survey m this place. Eminences of bones. The osseous eminences or processes were divided by the ancients into two great classes, apophyses and epiphyses, distinguished by the difference of their mode of development. According to their view, some of these eminences arise from the body of the bone, appearing to be nothing more than prolongations or vegetations of its substance: these they caUed apophyses; others, on the contrary, are formed by separate osseous centres or nuclei, which make their appearance at various times durmg the process of the development of bone : to these they gave the name of epiphyses. Ihis dis- tinction, however, founded upon incomplete observation has been totally re- jected, since the researches of M. Serres on Osteogeny have rendered it evi- dent, that almost aU the osseous eminences are developed from isolated nodides; so that an eminence, which at one time is an epiphysis, becomes . afterwards an apophysis. If therefore the majority of eminences are formed from separate osseous points, the difference ^^^^.^^f J^em can apply only to the relative periods at which they become united to the body of the bone. A far more important distinction is that by which the eminences are di- vided into articular and non-articular. The articular eminences have received different ..^-J.^^Peth o a denticulations, when they form angular eminences '"^^^^^^^g ^J^J^^^^etce saw ; these are best seen in the bones of the cramum.

THE LUNGS. 657 Structure of the Trachea, Bronchi, and Bronchial Ramifkaiions. , f ,1,0 h.„rl,pa The trachea is composed of a series of imperfect Structure ''"^ed by an equal number of fibrous rings, and hence cartilagmous rmgs, separatea oy 4 permanently open, it has a k-tted appear^^^^^^^^^ P , Had the t-^^c^ea been entirely m^^^^^^ ^ inspiration, .vhich ^^f P'^^^e of the air.

Each ring has two suSes one anterior and convex, the other posterior and concave; an upper Infa Wer eS both of .vhich are thin and give attachment to the fibrous Ss and two%xtremities, which terminate abruptly without bemg mflected rfhi^kTned In general there is but little regularity in the arrangement of tLsIrSgsT they a^ not exactly parallel, nor are they of equal depth ^vlnch varies from a Une to a line and a half, two, or even two hnes and a half; and the same ring is often of unequal depth at different points. Two rings are often united for a certain extent, and sometimes a ring is found bifiircated; in- deed it is probable that differences in the number of the rmgs depend upon their thus uniting or dividing. They are sufficiently thin to allow of being compressed, so that the opposite surfaces may touch without breaking. Iheir elasticity enables them to recover their original position immediately, and thus permit free access to the air. They can only be broken when ossified, which is frequently the case in the aged. . n^x. c ^ The first ring and the two lower rings present some peculiarities. _ i he farst is broader than any of the others, especiaUy in the middle line, and it is often continuous with the cricoid cartilage.* _ The last ring of the trachea, which forms the transition between it and the bronchi, has the following characters : —the middle part is prolonged consider- ably downwards, and curved backwards, forming a very acute angle, and is developed into a spur-shaped projection within the trachea, which separates the two bronchi. The two half rings resulting from this arrangement consti- tute the two first rings of the bronchi. The last ring but one of the trachea presents an angular inflection in the middle, less marked, however, than that observed in the lowest ring. The fibrous tissue of the trachea. This is arranged in the following manner:— a fibrous cylinder commences at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage; the cartilaginous rings are situated within the substance of this cylinder in such a manner, that the thicker layer of fibrous tissue lies on their exterior, so that at first sight their internal surfaces would appear to be in immediate contact with the mucous membrane. In the posterior part of the trachea, where the cartilaginous rings are wanting, the fibrous tissue alone forms its basis or framework. The muscular fibres of the trachea. If we carefully remove the fibrous tissue from the back of the trachea, opposite its membranous portion, we arrive at to the opinion of M. Cruveilhier, receives support from what is known concerning the develope- ment of the lungs, and from the analogy between these organs and the compound glands. In^. 172., after Reisseisen, o shows the natural size of the portion represented magnified about nine diameters in b. The bronchial twigs and pulmonary cells are seen distended with air; the knots or projections (d) on the sides of some of the twigs, indicate the commencement of other twigs into which no air has passed.] * I have met with one case in which the thin upper rings of the trachea and the cricoid car- tilage were joined together, but only on one side; the crico-thyroid muscle and the inferior constrictor of the pharynx evidently arose from the first ring of the trachea. This continuity of the cricoid cartilage with the trachea, manifestly proves that the rings of the latter are car- tilages, and not fibro-cartilages.

It frequently happens that SHwo clavicular fecettes are not at the same height; a fact which was no- liced by Morgagni, and which I have attributed to the unequal wearing of the %° "ihtSf^ril^oraMor^ind e.tremii, is formed by the .iphoid appendi.

In length, shape, and direction, it presents numerous varieties: it is frequently bifid, sometimes pierced by a foramen and is occasionaUy bent forwards, or to one side, and in certam cases much depressed: its summit gives attachment to an aponeurotic structure, called the Unea alba; behind, it indirectly corresponds with the stomach, which rests upon it when the body is placed in a prone position. . „ , Connections. The sternum articulates with sixteen bones; viz. fourteen ribs through the medium of their cartilages, and the two clavicles. Structure. It consists of two very thin compact lammae, with an mter- venmg spongy substance, the ceUs of which are very large, and have Tery delicate parietes: it is one of the most spongy bones of the body, and to this circumstance the frequency of its diseases is doubtiess attributable. Development. The sternum is one of the slowest bones m its ossification; up to the sixth month of foetal life the broad cartilage of which it is com- posed exhibits no bony points. It is also, of all the bones, the one m which the phenomena of ossification proceed with least regularity. For the sake of sim- plicity we shall study in succession the development of the three parts which we have indicated, under the names of manubrium, body, and xiphoid appendix. 1, Ossification of the manubrium. This part of the bone sometimes presents a single nucleus, rounded, and transversely oblong; sometimes it presents two nuclei, and in this case they may be either placed one above the other, or side by side. In the former case the uppermost nucleus is the larger; in the latter, both may be symmetrical and of equal size, or what is far more common they may be of unequal magnitude. Lastly, the manubrium occasionally presents more than two osseous points. Albinus found three in one subject and four in another. It should be remarked, that in the case of plurality of osseous points, the largest are generally situated above: the exceptions to this rule are very rare. The osseous points make their appearance from the fifth to the sixth month of fcetal life. 2. Of the body. The osseous nuclei which enter into the composition of the body of the sternum have generally a rounded form when they are single, and are situated in the median line; when they exist in pairs, or are placed late- rally, they are more elongated, but smaller, and appear to represent only the half of one of the single nodules. These different osseous points are always so arranged as to be situated between two costo-sternal articulations, so that a portion of the sternum is developed in each of the intervals comprised between

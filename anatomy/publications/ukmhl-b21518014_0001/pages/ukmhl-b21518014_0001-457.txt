THE VELUM PALATI. 435 F F 2 covering the anterior and posterior surfaces of the alveoli, communicate with each other. The reflected portion of the gum, though not adhering to, is in contact with, all that portion of the root of the tooth which projects above the alveolus ; it then dips into the cavity of the latter, so as to form the alveolo- dentalperiosteum, which, as we have already seen, is a powerful means of con- necting the fang of the tooth to its socket. The tissue of the gums appears to be provided with particular follicles for the secretion of the tartar.* It varies much in different individuals, both in colour and in density. One of its most peculiar characters is the singular effect produced on it by scurvy and by mercury, under the influence of which agents it becomes softened and fungous, easily bleeds, and furnishes a large quantity of tartar. * Another, but purely anatomical character consists in its largely developed openings or pores, which in a particular light are even visible to the naked eye. The gums are almost insensible when divided by cutting instruments; but the pressure exerted upon them by the teeth during the eruption of the latter, often gives rise to the most serious affections. Vessels and nerves of the roof of the palate and the gums. The arteries arise, some from the internal maxillary, viz. the posterior palatine, the alveolar, the infra-orbital, and the mental branches ; others from the facial, viz. the superior coronary for the gums of the upper, and the sub-mental branches for those of the lower jaw; the sublingual artery also supplies the latter. The veins bear the same name. All the nerves proceed from the fifth pair, viz. the palatine and the superior and inferior dental branches. The naso-palatine nerve sends ramifications to the small median tubercle upon the roof of the palate. Few parts have so little cellular tissue as the gums. Developsment. According to the best authorities the bony and membranous portions of the hard palate are developed from two lateral points which unite aJong the median line, so that the malformation, known by the name of hare- bp with cleft palate, is said to be an arrest of developement. The fissure may be either smgle or double in front. If the cleft be double, that portion of the upper jaw, which supports the incisor teeth, is separated on both sides from the rest of the bone. Such divisions always seem to me to be absolutely depar- tures from nature t, for at no period of its growth can such separations or clefts be detected m a naturally formed fcetus. Uses of the gums and hard palate. The hard palate separates the buccal cavity from the nasal fossa. It serves as a fulcrum for the tongue in the act of tasting, m mastication, deglutition, and the articulation of sounds. Before the eruption of the teeth, the gums completely close the alveoli and serve as the .t^^f ^r^^*' of mastication ; and they become hard, and supply the place of the teeth after the loss of those organs.

The incisor and canine teeth have only one scale; the bicuspides have two; and the great molares as many as there are tubercles. These small scales so intimately embrace the pulp upon which they are moulded, that it requires some force to detach them ; and yet their inner surface, as well as the outer, is very smooth. It should be remarked, that the pulp has a much more vividly red colour at the points covered by the scales. The scales are visible in the lower jaw at an earlier period than in the upper. The following is the order in which they appear : â€”The middle incisors are visible from the fourth to the fifth month ; they are soon followed, 1. by the lateral incisors ; 2. by the first or anterior molar, which appears from the fifth to the sixth month ; 3. at a short interval from each other, by the canine and the second molar; the scales of all the teeth of the first set have made their appearance by the seventh month, according to the observations of Meckel; but at the eighth month, according to Blake. As de velopement advances the scales enlarge, and gradually uniting {2, fig. 99.) form a sheath or shell of ivory, which, during its growth, incloses the pulp, and, by degrees, extends to the vascular and nervous pedicle at the part where it pe- netrates the alveolus.* The outermost sheath being formed, a second is deposited within it, then a third within that, and so on. The external surface of the bulb secretes the ivory. The enamel is formed from the parietal or alveolar layer of the follicular membrane : at the commencement of its formation it is so soft that, in a foetus at the full time, it can be very easUy separated from the ivory. It has been asserted by some that the enamel, as well as the ivory, is the product of a secretion from the bulb, from which it has transuded in a liqmd state through the different layers of the ivory, and has then solidified upon its sur- face ; others affirm that the enamel is a sort of crystaUine deposit from the fluid surrounding the tooth ; but the greater number of anatomists admit, with Hunter, that the enamel is a product of secretion from the parietal layer f, as the ivory is from the layer of the follicular membrane, reflected upon the bulb. This opinion appears to me the more probable, because, on examining with at- tention the parietal layer, we find on its inner surface, near the crown ot the tooth, a sort of pulp, or very evident enlargement, particularly in the follicles of the molar teeth. This external pulp becomes atrophied as soon as the but to the fibres of the inter-tubular substance in a growing tooth.

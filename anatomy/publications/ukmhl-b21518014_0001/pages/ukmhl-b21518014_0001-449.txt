Vessels and nerves also enter into the formation of the alimentary canal: for example, we tind a very abundant supply of branches from the adjacent arterial trimks ; an immense number of veins, ot which those from the sub-diaphragmatic portion of the canal terminate in the venaportse; absorbent vessels, divided into lymphatics and lacteals ; and lastly nerves, ahnost aU of which proceed from the ganglionic system, excepting the pneumogas- tric and glosso-pharyngeal nerves. Division of the digestive canal. The digestive canal has been divided into several parts, from differences both in their anatomical characters and their functions. One principal division, which deserves to be retained, is into a supra-diaphrag- matic and a sub-diaphragmatic portion. The supra- diaphragmatic portion comprehends the mouth, the pharynx, and the cesophagus. The infra-diaphrag- matic portion includes the stomach (a h,fig. 139.); the small intestine, subdivided into the duodenum {b c), and the jejunum and ileum (c d); and the large intestine, somewhat arbitrarily divided into the ca:cum (d e), the colon (d h), and the rectum {h i). The appendages of the digestive canal consist of the salivary, glands, connected with the mouth; of the liver and the pancreas, connected with the duodenum; and of the spleen, which may be regarded as an appendage cf the liver. » FThe lining membrane of the digestive apparatus, forming part of the gastro-pulmonary system of the mucous membranes, extends not only throughout the entire aUmentary canal, but also along the ducts of the various glands which pour their secretions into it. Structure in general. Mucous membranes are usually soft, pulpy, incapable of great distension, easily lacerated, somewhat opaque, and, when free from blood, of a pale greyish or ashy hue. The dermis or chorion (analogous to that of the skin) is a basis of cellular tissue, ot very variable thickness ; its attached surface is connected to the subjacent textures, either immove- ably as in the nasal cavities and on the tongue, or loosely, as in the gullet and stomach, ibe pellicle or epithelium with which its surface is always covered (corresponding to the epiuermis of the skin), also varies much in thickness in different situations ; it consists of transparent nucleated cells, according to the form and arrangement of which it receives its name. 1 hus m the squamous epithelium there are generally (as in the mouth and gullet) several layers ot cells: of these the deepest are vesicular, and contain a comparatively large nucleus; those on the surface are flattened out into polygonal scales, from the centre of which the nucleus has nearly dis.ippeared, whilst the intermediate cells present intermediate transitional lorms. _ Ihe nucleated cells of the columnar epithelium (found, for example, in the stomach and intes- tines) are developed into oblong cylinders, arranged in a single series, like basaltic columns, perpendicularly to the surface of the dermis. In some situations, as in the nasal cavities and air passages, cilia are attached to the free extremities of the cylinders of the columnar epithe- lium, but no cilia have been detected in any part of the alimentary canal of man, or the warm- blooded animals : the superficial cells of the epithelium of mucous membranes are continually being thrown off by a process of desquamation. The different raucous membranes differ in

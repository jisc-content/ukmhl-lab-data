la* OSTEOLOGY. calcis. 3. The posterior or calcaneal surface is sinuous, directed obliquely inwards and backwards, and adapted to the os calcis in such a way that there is a mutual reception of the surfaces of the two bones. At the inside of this surface, we observe a process which is directed inwards and backwards, and strengthens the union with the os calcis. It occasionally becomes an ob- stacle to the disarticulation of the foot after Chopart's method. 4. The anterior or metatarsal surface looks obliquely inwards and forwards; it articulates with the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. 5. The inter7ial surface articulates with the third cuneiform bone, and frequently also with the scaphoid. It presents, besides, some impressions for the insertion of ligaments. 6. Ine external surface is rather an edge; its extent from before backwards scarcely equals half the length of the internal surface. We observe on it the commence- ment of the groove for the tendon of the peroneus longus. TTie Scaphoid ig,figs. 54, 55, and 56.). The scaphoid or navicular bone, so named from its supposed resemblance to a boat, is situated on the inner side of the tarsus ; it is flattened fro«i l^efo^e backwards, and is thicker above than below, irregularly elliptical, with the long diameter placed transversely. It has two surfaces, and a circumference. 1. The posterior surface is concave, and receives, though incompletely, the head of the astragalus. 2. The anterior surface presents three articular fa- cettes, which conlspond to the three cuneifonn bones. 3. The czrcumference is convex above, inclined inwards, and rough for ligamentous insertions I is much smaller below, where also it gives attachment to hgaments.

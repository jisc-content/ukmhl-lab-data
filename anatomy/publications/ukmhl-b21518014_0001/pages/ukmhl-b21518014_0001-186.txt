"We know, that the two last dorsal vertebrae are remarkable for the shortness of their spinous and transverse processes; and that the ribs with which they articulate are very moveable, and could not oppose the motions of the vertebrse in any degree. The lumbar region participates much more in the general motions than the dorsal. The articular processes in this region are much more advantageously adapted for rotation than in either the dorsal or cervical, for the lower pair of each vertebra forms a solid cylinder, which is received into the hollow surface of the superior articulating processes of the vertebra below. This arrange- ment permits a motion resembling that of the hinges of a door. It should be remarked, that in all the regions the lower articular processes of each vertebra are placed behind the superior articular processes of the succeeding vertebra, and form a sort of imbrication. Each vertebra then is retained in its place by a species of dove-tailing, so that it cannot be dis- located forwards, without breaking the superior articular processes of the vertebra below, nor backwards, without breaking the inferior articular pro- cesses of the vertebra above. This remark does not apply rigorously to the cervical region, the articular processes of which are obUque, and can permit dislocation without fracture. Mechanism of the Articulations of the Vertebral Column and the Head. The movements of the head upon the vertebral column are shared between two articulations: viz. 1. the occipito-atlantal, to which all the J^otions of flexion, extension, lateral inclination, and circumduction belong; 2. the at- lanto-axoid, which only performs one movement, viz. rotation. Mechanism of the Occipito-atlantal Articulation.

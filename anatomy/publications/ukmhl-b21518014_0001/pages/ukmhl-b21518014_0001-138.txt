OSTEOLOGY 116 The Os Coxee, or Os Innominatum (Jigs. 47 and 48.). The haunch bone, called also os coxa, from coxa the haunch, occupies the lateral and anterior parts of the pelvis. It is the largest of all the hroad hones of the skeleton. It is asymmetrical, very irregular in its figure, and twisted upon itself, so that it appears to he composed of two portions; one superior, triangular, shaped like a wing, and flattened from without inwards ; the other inferior, and flattened from before backwards. These two parts are united by a contracted portion. On this bone we have for consideration an external or femoral surface, which corresponds with the thigh, an internal or pelvic surface, and a circumference. On the femoral surface (Jig. 47.) we observe the following parts:—On the contracted portion, which unites the upper and the lower half of the os coxse, is the cotyloid cavity (a. Jigs. 47, 48.)-(from KOTvK-n a cup), or aceta- bulum). This is of a hemispherical shape, and is the deepest of all the articular cavities; it looks obliquely downwards, outwards, and a little for- wards, and has a considerable depres- sion ib,fig. 47.) at the bottom on its inner aspect. The margin (c) of this cavity is sharp and sinuous, and pre- sents three notches, or rather one notch and two slight depressions, one of which is superior, and the other inferior and somewhat external. The notch (f/) is situated below and on the ^ inside ; it is very deep, and converted grooves; the upper one is superficial, aBd g^^«« jl™*: , i^es pansion, one of the origins of the rec<«./cwt.,- the lo^ er is dee^^^^^^ Jassage'to the tendon of the obturator externus^^^^ the OS cox^E presents abroad ^"angular surface ^P'°P^^^ _ foss (e).

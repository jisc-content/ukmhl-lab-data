THE TRIANGULARIS ORIS. 307 its origin, arises from the canine fossa by a broad attachment, from which it proceeds downwards and a little outwards, diminishing in size, and becoming gradually more superficial, to the commissure of the lips, where it terminates by uniting with the zygomaticus major, and becoming continuous with the triangularis oris. We often find some accessory fibres arising from this muscle, and attached to the skin opposite the commissure. Relations. Above, it is concealed by the levator labii superioris and the infra-orbitary vessels and nerves; below, it is quite superficial, being only covered by the skin. It covers the superior maxiUa, the buccinator, and the buccal mucous membrane. Action. It raises the angle of the mouth, and from its oblique position draws it inwards. The Zygomatici Major et Minor. Dissection. Make an oblique incision from the malar bone to the commis- sure of the lip, and remove carefully from the great zygomatic the fatty tissue which surrounds it. The Zygomaticus Major. This muscle (m',fig. 113.) is a cylindrical fleshy fasciculus extending from the malar bone to the commissure of the lip. It arises by tendinous fibres from the entire length of a horizontal furrow situated above the lower edge of the malar bone. The fleshy fibres approach each other so as to form a fasciculus, which passes obliquely downwards and inwards towards the commis- sure, where it is closely united to the canme muscle, and, like it, is continuous with the triangularis or depressor anguli oris. Relations. It is covered by the skin from which it is separated above bv the orbicularis palpebrarum, and below by a large quantity of adipose tissue'- It covers the malar bone, the masseter and buccinator muscles, a great col- lection of fat, and the labial vein. Action. It draws the angle of the mouth upwards and outwards; by carrvinff the commissure upwards it assists the canine muscle, but in drawing it out- ftag°°is.es the same. When the zygomatic and canine contract together, the commissure is drawn directly upwards. The Zygomaticus Minor. This small muscle {n;fig. lis.), which is often wanting, may be regarded as a dependence of the proper elevator of the upper lip. It Irises from £ malar brefo72 feS r/h^'"''^"^'- P--^l--ard's and inwLdsTo the out border of the le^ ator labu superioris. with which it is blended. It is not un- common to find this muscle enlarged by fasciculi given off from the outer and Wr circmnference of the orbicularis muscle of the eyelids. It is covered KLtbiaTve^n!

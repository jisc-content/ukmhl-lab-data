THE SUPINATOR BREVIS. 333 or epicondyle of the humerus, by a tendon common to it and the extensor muscles of the fingers; also from a very strong aponeurosis situated upon its posterior surface; and from another tendinous septum which divides it from the extensor communis digitorum. It is inserted into the back part of the upper end of the third metacarpal bone. The fleshy fibres, thus arising from the ex- ternal condyle by means of an aponeurotic pyramid, are attached to the pos- terior surface of a tendon which becomes gradually narrower and thicker as it receives them. The fibres themselves terminate about the middle of the fore- arm, and then the fiat tendon passes backwards into the same groove on the radius as that of the last-named muscle, the two tendons being retained in it by the same fibrous sheath, and lubricated by the same synovial membranes, but separated from each other by a small vertical ridge of bone. After leaving the common sheath, the tendon of the short separates from that of the long radial extensor, passes stUl more posteriorly, and is inserted into the third metacarpal bone {o',figs. 121,122.). Relations. It is covered by the preceding muscle, and like it is crossed ob- liquely on the outside by the long abductor, the short and then the long ex- tensor muscles of the thumb : it covers the external surface of the radius, from which it is separated by the supinator brevis above, and the pronator teres in the middle. Its tendon covers and protects the back of the wrist. In con- sequence of the different length of their fleshy fibres, the supinator longus and the two radial extensors of the carpus are arranged one above the other, the highest being the supinator longus, and the lowest the extensor carpi radialis brevier. Action of the two radial extensors. These two muscles, which from their in- sertions might be called the posterior radials, extend the second row of the carpus upon the first, and this upon the fore-arm; they are also abductors of the hand, for they incline it towards the radial side of the fore-arm. The extensor carpi radialis longior being attached to the humerus, can assist in flexing the fore-arm. The Supinator £revis. Dissection. _ Pronate the fore-arm forcibly. In order to expose this muscle completely, divide the two radial extensors of the carpus, and even some of the muscles of the superficial layer on the back of the fore-arm. The supinator brevis (p,fgs. 119, 120. 122.) is a broad muscle curved into the form of a hollow cylinder, and rolled round the upper third of the radius: It forms by itself the deep layer of the external region of the fore-arm. Attachments. It arises from the external lateral Ugament of the elbow, with which It IS blended, and by this means from the external condyle ; from the annular hgament of the radius; from the external border of the ulna, which is provided with a projecting ridge for this purpose; from a deep triangular exca- vation, in front of this ridge, and below the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna: and, lastly, from the deep surface of an expansion of its tendon of origin and the external lateral hgament, which covers the greater part of the muscle. From these difi-erent origins (fig. 122.) the fleshy fibres pass round the radius, into the posterior, external, and anterior surfaces of which bone they are inserted. i?q "ton ? ^^<='P^*^^ ^'^^^'■''^^ a°<i *e tendon of the biceps (figs. t^^'JiVf ^^f^ afieshy prolongation of this muscle, covering the an- 2i extensor '''' ^'6^^"*°^ *e radius, of which it might be regarded nin^tSl^' supiJiator brevis is covered by the radial extensors, the su- tensor H J^r""'- .pronator teres, the extensor communis digitorum, the ex- ar?e^ tflTT' ''^''P' anconeus, and the radial iTgament the elbnw T^T '^'^ '^^^'^ also its annular Keep bran?n7ti 'v","^ '^"^ mterosseous ligament.

The parietal fossa, a concavity corresponding to the prominence of the same name, is situated in the middle of this surface. The superior or sagittal border (a bfig. 17 and 18.) is the longest, it is thick and denticulated, and by its union with the op- posite bone foi-ms the sagittal suture. On its internal surface there is a furrow along its Fi/;. 18. <i whole extent, which, with that in the op- posite bone, forms the groove for the longitudinal sinus Near this border is sometimes found a foramen (c), {foramen parietale), of very variable dimensions, which opens into the posterior part of the groove and transmits a vein. The inferior or temporal border {d e) is the shortest: it is concave, thin, and very obliquely cut on the outside, so as to resemble a scale with radiated fur- rows ; hence its name {margo squamosus): it articulates with the squamous portion of the temporal bone. , • j x i The anterior or frontal border (Jb e) is less thick and less deeply indented than the occipital edge; it is bevilled externaUy above, and internally below, so as to articulate with the frontal bone, which presents a precisely opposite ar- rangement. . . J J • 1 i The posterior or occipital border (a d) is very deeply indented, and articulates with the superior border of the occipital by the lambdoid suture. Of the/oar angles, the two superior are right angles ; of the inferior, the anterior or sphe- noidal (e) is acute, and rendered very thin by the sloping of the anterior and inferior edges of the bone. Inside this angle is situated the principal furrow, or sometimes canal, which lodges the middle meningeal artery and veins: surgeons therefore recommend this angle to be avoided in performing the operation of trepanning. The posterior or mastoid angle {d) is, as it were, truncated, and is received into the retreating angle formed by the union of the mastoid and squamous portions of the temporal bone. Internally it is grooved for the reception of part of the lateral sinus (e,Jig. 22.). Connections. The parietal is articulated with five bones : the frontal, the occipital, the temporal, the sphenoid, and the opposite parietal. Above it is separated from the skin by the cranial aponeurosis only, and consequently it exposes a large extent of surface to the action of external agents: hence fractures of this bone are very common, and they are more frequently than other fractures accompanied by effusions of blood, on account of the conuection with the middle meningeal artery and vein. The internal structure is quite similar to that of the frontal. As in that bone, we find venous canals traversing long tracts in the substance of the diploe. Development. The parietal bone is developed from one point of ossification alone, which appears in the situation of the protuberance. Its first traces are K 4

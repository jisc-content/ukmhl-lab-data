THE STOMACH. 477 The vessels and nerves of the stomach. The arteries are very large and nu- merous i™ortion to the size of the stomach; they must therefore assist m The pXSe of some function besides t^e mere nutrmon o^ h^^^^^^^ this function is the secretion of the gastric J^^^f ^ JJ^'^y.^ll^" .^^^^^^^^^ coeliac axis and are the coronary, the superior pyloric and right gastro-epipioic branch^ of the hepatic, and the left gastro-epipioic and vasa brevia, which Se b. anches of the'sple^iic artery. tLsc arteries anastomose so as u> ft-m around the stomach a vascular zone, which is in close contact ^i'^J^^a durino- distension, but at some distance from it when empty. From this arte rtl ci^rcle bra;:h;.s are given off, which at first lie between f ntoneal a^^^ the muscular coats; but after a certain number of divisions and anastomoses perforate the muscular and fibrous coats, and again subdivide and anastomose a great number of times in the loose submucous cellular tissue, until having become capiUary, they penetrate the mucous membrane. ^ • The veins bear the same name, and follow the same direction as the arteries ; they contribute to form the vena porta;. Schmiedel ( Variet. Vasormn, No. xix p 26 ) has seen the coronary vein of the stomach anastomose with the renal vein ; the pyloric with the vena azj gos, and one of the vense breves with the phrenic vein. . ■ i i, The lymphatic vessels are very numerous, and terminate in the lympnatic glands, situated along the two curvatures of the stomach. The peculiar ducts, said to proceed from the spleen to the stomach, and supposed by the ancients to be passages for the atra bilis, are purely imaginary. The nerves are of two kinds, some being derived from the eighth pair, and others from the solar plexus. The nerves of the eighth pair form a plexus round the cardiac orifice ; the left nerve being distributed upon the anterior, and the right upon the posterior surface of the stomach. They may be followed as far as the muscular coat, where they seem to be lost; division of them paralyses this coat. By means of the nerves of the eighth pair, the stomach is connected with the oesophagus, the lungs, the pharynx, the larynx, and the heart. Through the nerves de- rived from the central epigastric plexus, and named after the arteries that support them, the stomach is connected with the ganglionic system, and is brought into relation with the numerous viscera of the abdomen. Lastly, a very delicate serous cellular tissue unites the different coats of the stomach. There are three layers of this tissue, viz. one between the peritoneal and the muscular coats, another between the muscular and the fibrous, and a third between the fibrous and the mucous coats. The last of these is the most distinct; it is liable to both serous and sanguineous effusions, and may become the seat of diffuse inflammation. I have lately seen it infiltrated with pus to a considerable extent, the mucous and the fibrous coats being both per- fectly healthy. Developement of the stomach. The stomach of the foetus is remarkable on account of its vertical position, which is due to the great developement of the liver, especially of its left lobe. An unnatural developement of that lobe will also occasion a similar position of the stomach in the adult. The relative smaUness of the stomach, and the slight developement of its tuberosity, are also characteristic of its foetal condition.* Nevertheless, from the first moment of its appearance, it is distinguished from the rest of the alimentary canal by its greater size. The changes which the adult stomach undergoes, and the variations in size which it presents, are perhaps less dependent upon congenital differences than upon particular habits. The differences in the two sexes are manifestly due to the pressure, to which the stomach of the female is subject, either from the use of stays, or from the gravid uterus. I may here advert * [At early periods of foetal life, villi are found on the mucous membrane of the stomach ge- nerally, afterwards on the pyloric portion only ; and, subsequently to birth, the only traces of these are the irregular fringes observed here and there between the alveoli.]

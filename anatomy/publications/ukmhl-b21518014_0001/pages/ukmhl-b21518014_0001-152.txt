130 OSTEOLOGY. most slender of all tht long bones, and may be at once recognised by this cha- racter. Its direction is vertical, with a slight inclination outwards at its lower part. It is the most twisted of all the long bones, and is a remarkable exem- plification of that law of osteology, viz. that the torsion of bones is always con- nected with changes of direction of tendons, or vessels. It is divided into a body and two extremities. The body has the form of a triangular prism. In order rightly to compre- hend its shape, it is necessary to be aware that the muscles which are placed on its external surface above, turn round to the posterior aspect below, from which it is easy to understand how the four upper fifths of the external surface look outwards, and the lower fifth backwards. The external surface (n) is marked by a deep groove which runs along it, and gives attachment to the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis. The lower part, which is turned backwards, is smooth. The internal surface is divided into two unequal parts by a longitudinal ridge, to which the interosseous ligament is attached. The portion of the surface in front of the ridge is narrower than the other, being in some subjects not more than two lines in breadth ; it gives attachment to the muscles on the fore part of the leg ; the portion behind the ridge is larger, and gives attachment to the tibialis posticus. This surface be- comes anterior at its lower part (o). The posterior surface of the fibula is narrow above, and expanded below, where it looks inwards, and terminates by a rough part, to which ligaments that unite it to the tibia are attached. The whole of this surface gives attach- ment to muscles. We observe on it the principal nutritious canal, which passes obliquely downwards. This canal is sometimes placed on the internal surface of the bone. . . m, . The three edges participate in the deviations of the surfaces. 1 hus the outer edge (r) becomes posterior below; the anterior edge (s) becomes external, and is bifurcated ; the internal edge becomes anterior, and after being thus changed forms the continuation of the ridge for the interosseous hgament, which we noticed upon the inner surface. , vi ^ • All the edges give attachment to muscles, and are remarkable for their ^'^ThTsuSrior extremity or head («) of the fibula presents an articular facette (■near 0 slightly concave, which unites with a corresponding surface on the tibia: on the outside are some irregular impressions for the insertion of the biceps muscle, and the external lateral ligament of the knee At the back part of this head we observe the styloid process of the fibula (below 0 for the tendon of the biceps. , ■. i ^x. • c The lower extremity or external malleolus (« v) passes much below the mfe- rior articular surface of the tibia; it is longer and thicker than the mternal maUeolus.

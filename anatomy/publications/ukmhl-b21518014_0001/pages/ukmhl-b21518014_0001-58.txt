On each side of the median line are two shallow grooves, named the sacral grooves: they are continuations of the vertebral grooves;they are pierced by four posterior sacral foramina, smaller than the anterior foramma, and differing less from each other in diameter. These afford passage to the posterior branches of the sacral nerves, to some veins and arteries. They are bordered by two ranges of unequal projections : the first row placed mterior to the foramina, represent the articular processes united together; the second, ex- ternal to the foramina, are more marked, and correspond with the transverse processes also united. . , , •, ^ The lateral surfaces ( d, e,fig.\.) are triangular, broad above, narrow below, where they constitute mere borders. They slope obliquely from before backwards and from without inwards, so that the sacrum is wedged between the haunch bones in an antero-posterior as well as in a vertical direction In front is a demi-oval or crescentic suiface (7, fig. 8.) com- pared from its shape to the human ear, and hence denommated auncviar sur- face In the fresh state it is covered with cartUage, and articulates with tne OS inuominatum.

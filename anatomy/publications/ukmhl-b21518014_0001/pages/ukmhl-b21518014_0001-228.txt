206 ARTHROLOGY. preserving the reflected tendon of the rectus femoris. This articulation is the type of the order enarthrosis, being a tme hall and socket joint. The articular surfaces are the globular head of the femur, and the cotyloid cavity of the os innominatum. There is a striking difference between this joint and that of the shoulder, as far as regards the size of the articular head and the depth of the articular cavity. Both of the surfaces above-named are covered with cartilage, with the exception of two depressions, one of which is situated on the head of the femur, the other at the bottom of the cotyloid cavity ; the latter is filled with a reddish adipose tissue, improperly called the cotyloid gland. It is analogous to the adipose tissue fouiid in the neighbour- hood of all the joints: its use is not well known; perhaps it is intended to protect the thin bottom of the cotyloid cavity from the effects of shocks or pressure. rr,,. • ■ , , Means of union. The cotyloid ligaments (n, fig. 76.). This ligament is attached to the margin of the acetabulum, which it as it were completes : it augments the depth of the cavity, and renders smooth its sinuous and notched circum- ference. It is of greater size at the notches than in any other part: by its means the irregularities of the edge of the acetabulum are effaced, and the deep notch in front and below is converted into a foramen for the passage of vessels to the fatty tissue and the interarticular ligament. It is much thicker above and behind than below and in front, and it is pre- cisely against the first two points that the head of the femur constantly presses. It is also remarkable in this respect, that the diameter of its free borders is smaller than that by which it is attached, and this circumstance assists in some degree in retaining the head of the femur in the cotyloid cavity. It consists of fibres which arise successively from aU points of the circumference of the acetabulum, and interlace at very acute angles. This interlacement is especially visible in the situation of the great anterior notch, where the fibres may be seen arising from each side of the notch, and passing across each other. The capsular or orbicular ligament (p,fig. 76.). This represents a fibrous sac having two openings, by one of which it embraces the acetabulum, outside the cotyloid ligament, whilst the other surrounds the neck of the femur. The femoral insertion of the capsular ligament requires to be carefuUy studied for the purpose of explaining the difference between fractures within, and frac- tures beyond, the capsule. This insertion is so arranged that at the "pper pai t of the joint, it corresponds with the base of the neck of the femur, whUe be- neath it is situated at the junction of the external with the two in ernal thirds of the neck The length of the capsular hgament is exactly equal to the dis- tance between its insfrtions, excepting at the inner part, where it is much Sore loose. Hence the extent of the motion of abduction, which is so re- markable in some jugglers that they are able to separate their legs, until they form right angles with the body, without producmg disloca ion. The fhicknfss of this ligament is not equal throughout: it is greatest above anion t?e outside, where the reflected tendon of the -<=t«^^^^^ it is less thick behind, and stiU thinner on the mside.

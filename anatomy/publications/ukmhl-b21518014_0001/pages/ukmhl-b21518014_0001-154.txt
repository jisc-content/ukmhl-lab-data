OSTEOLOGY. 132 vantages derived from the mechanism of arches, but is especially intended to afford a protecting excavation for the organs which could not with impunity he compressed in standing and progression. The posterior and free extremity of the tarsus is narrow, and progressively enlarges forwards. The tarsus is composed of seven bones, disposed in two rows. The first or tibial row is formed by two bones only, the os calcis (c), and the astragalus (a); the second or metatarsal row consists of five bones, viz. the scaphoid (g), the cuboid (/), and the three cuneiform bones {i j I). The bones of the first row, instead of being placed in the same transverse line like those of the first row of the carpus, rest one upon the other. The astragalus is the only bone of the tarsus which enters into the formation of the ankle joint. First or Tibial Row of the Tarsus. The Astragalus (a). The astragalus is placed below the tibia, above the os calcis, on the inside of the malleolar extremity of the fibula, and behind the scaphoid ; it is irregularly cuboid in its figure, is the second largest bone of the tarsus, and has six sur- faces. 1. The superior or tibial surface (a, fig. 54.) is articular, and shaped hke a trochlea or puUey, which fits exactly to the lower surface of the tibia. In front and behind the trochlea, are inequalities for the attachment of hgaments. 2. The inferior or calcaneal surface {a, fig. 55.) presents two facettes, separated bv a verv deep furrow running obliquely backwards and mwards, and broadest in front which gives insertion to a ligament. The facette behind the groove is the larger; it is concave and oblong in the same direction as the groove. The facette in front is flat, and often divided into two smaller surfaces Both articulate with the os calcis. 3. The internal lateral surface {fig. 56.) is ar- ticular for a considerable portion of its upper part, and corresponds to the m- ternal malleolus ; below, there is a rough depression, which gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the ankle joint. 4. The external lateral mr- faceis triangular, like the corresponding smface of the external malleolus with ihich it articulates. It should be remarked that both the lateral articular sur- faces of the astragalus are continuous with the trochlea, or upper surface, ^ith- out interruption. 5. The anterior or scaphoid surface is convex and has been caUed the head of the astragalus; it is articular, and '^o'^?^^^!"^^^'*?,^;^ anterior facette of the lower surface of the bone already described This he^ is supported by a contracted portion, ornec^ ( b,fig. 54 and 56.), to which lig<i- ment's'areTtta'ched. 6.

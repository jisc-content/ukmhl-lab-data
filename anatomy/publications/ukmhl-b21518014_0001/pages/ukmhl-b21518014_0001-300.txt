The lumbar portion (psoas magnus, from ^6ui, the loms, gg,Jig.\U.\ arises from the sides of the bodies of the five lumbar and last dorsal vertebra;, and of the corresponding inter-vertebral substances, and from the base of the transverse processes, by means of aponeurotic fibres, united by tendmous arches, vehich correspond to the grooves on the bodies of the lumbar ver- tebrse so that the muscle is in reality only attached to the upper and lower borders of the bodies of the vertebrse, and to the inter-vertebral substances. From this double origin the fleshy fibres proceed in the form of a conoid bundle compressed on the sides, and directed obliquely downwards and out- wards •' the summit of the cone is flattened, and embraced by the hgamentum arcuatmn • the body is thicker and rounded, and diminishes in size mferiorly, as its constituent fibres are gi-adually attached to a tendon, which, though at first concealed in its centre, afterwards advances towards the anterior and external surface, receives the fibres of the iliacus, and is inserted into the lesser trochanter of the femui-. The great psoas, therefore, resembles a double *'*'lts°comionent fibres are not fasciculated, but are united by a very deUcate -ellular tissue. The complete absence of fibrous tissue explains the weakness ;f this muscle, which may be torn with the greatest facility, and perhaps also the frequency of its diseases. Its tenderness m the ox causes it to be a fa- vourite S for the table, under the name of short ribs {aloyau): perhaps this dEcy of texture is connected with the presence of a large plexus of nerves in the substance of the muscle. ^7;, ,•,•/;„ i n ^ 2 The iliac portion (iliacus muscle; ihacus intemus, Alb it,Jig. 111.) fills the internal iliac fossa.

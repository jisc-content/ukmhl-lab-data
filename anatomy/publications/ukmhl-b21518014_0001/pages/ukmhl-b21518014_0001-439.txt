THE APONEUROSIS OF THE FORE-ARM. 417 femoris; the pectoralis major, and the latissimus dorsi, are sufficient to effect its tension. The Aponeurosis of the Fore-arm and Hand. The Aponeurosis of the Fore-arm. Dissection. Make a circular incision through the skin, immediately above the elbow, and from this let two vertical incisions be carried downwards to the wrist, one in front and the other behind ; let the incisions extend through to the fascia without dividing it: then cautiously remove the skin, being careful to take with it the subcutaneous adipose tissue ; the superficial veins and nerves may be preserved. The external surface of the fascia may be studied first, and its several sheaths afterwards opened in succession. The aponeurosis or fascia of the fore-arm forms a general sheath, entirely surrrounding or embracing that portion of the upper extremity, with the excep- tion of the posterior border of the ulna. It is semi-transparent, and hence can be seen to be traversed by white lines, generally vertical in their direction, which indicate a corresponding number of thickenings of the sheath, and intermus- cular septa given ofi' from them. It is separated from the skin by the superficial veins and nerves; by its upper part it gives numerous attachments to the subjacent muscles, and this renders the dissection very difiicult. By making a vertical incision, however, along the separate sheath which it furnishes to each of the muscles, and then carefully removing the latter, a good idea may be formed of the numerous angular compartments into which the common cavity of the fascia is sub- divided. In the first place, it will be seen that this fascia, like all other mvestmg aponeuroses, is composed of proper and superadded fibres- that the proper fibres are nearly or quite circular, are more or less oblique and more or less interlaced, but the superadded fibres are vertical. It will be found that it is twice as thick upon the dorsal as upon the palmar surface of the fore-arm; that its thickness and its strength increase from above down- wards ; and that it is strengthened by a great number of superadded fasciculi consisting of aponeurotic expansions from the tendons of the adjacent muscles' Ihus the brachiahs anticus on the outside, the biceps on the inside and in front and the triceps behind, give off tendinous expansions to this aponeurosis • of these the most remarkable is, without doubt, that given off from the biceps tiSLr' Tv'^ ?s the tensor of the anterior portion^of Iwn^ ^.1, expansion constitutes, in fact, one of the terminations of the biceps with the external fasciculi of which it is continuous, and moreover arises from the outer edge and the anterior surface of its tendon.

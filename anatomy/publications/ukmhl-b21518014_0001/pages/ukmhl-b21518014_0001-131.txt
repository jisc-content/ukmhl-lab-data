The hand is in this position when laying hold ol any thing, or exercising the sense of touch. For facility of description we shall suppose the hand to be in the state of supination, and the palm turned for- wards. The axis of the hand is almost the same as that of the lore-arm. Tlie Carpus (a to f,fig- 46.). The carpus (trom Kap-nhs, wrist, Kafmeiv, to lay hold of) constitutes the bony structure of the wrist; it is of an oblong form, and almost elliptical trans- versely. The anterior surface (fig. 46.) is concave, and forms a deep groove in which the tendons of the flexor muscles are lodged. The posterior surface is convex, and in contact with the extensor tendons. They are both traversed by waved lines, which indicate the numerous articulations of the component bones. The upper border is convex, and articulates with the radius and ulna; the lower is irregular and sinuous, and articulates with the metacarpal bones. At each of the two extremities of the ellipse represented by the carpus, we observe two eminences which form a projection on the anterior aspect, and contribute to augment the depth of the groove which it forms. The two which occupy the outer edge of the wrist are much smaller than those which are situated on its inner border. The structure of the carpus is remarkable in this respect; that in proportion to its size, it presents in a given space a much greater number of bones than any other part of the skeleton. It consists in fact of eight bones, and is scarcely one inch in height, and two inches and a half in breadth. These eight bones are arranged in two series, or rows; an upper proximal or anti- brachial {a b c d), and a lower distal or metacarpal (e i g f). Each of these ranges is composed of four bones ; counting from the external or radial edge towards the internal or ulnar, they are, in the first row, the scaphoid (a), the semilunar (b), the cuneiform (c), (ot pyramidal), and the pisiform (d) ; in the second row, trapezium (c), the trapezoid (i), the os magnum (g), and the unci- forme (/). I shall not occupy time in describing successively the six surfaces on each of these bones. By simply explaining the law which regulates their configu- ration, I shall have the double advantage of avoiding prolixity, and of enabling the student to understand move correctly both their forms and relations.

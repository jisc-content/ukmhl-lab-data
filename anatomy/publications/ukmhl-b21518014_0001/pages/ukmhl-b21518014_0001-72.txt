50 OSTEOLOGY. and which, passing obliquely through the sides of the bone, opens in the sphe- noidal fissure. This canal is the trace of the still incomplete union of the anterior and posterior sphenoid ; it disappears as soon as the sinuses within the bone are developed. More externally, and on the same surface, is situated a small groove running from before backwards, which forms part of the pterygo- palatine canal, along which an artery of the same name passes. Still more ex- ternaUy are the pterygoid-processes (6 m /») (jr-ripvl, ala), two large projections directed perpendicularly downwards. In front their surface is broad above, where it forms part of the pterygo-maxiUary fossa, and rough below for arti- culation with the palate bone. Behind is a deep fossa, into which the internal pterygoid muscle is inserted: it is named the pterygoid fossa, and is formed by two laminse, named the external and internal pterygoid plates, of which the ex- ternal (h) is the broader, and the internal (m) the longer. At the upper part of the internal plate is an elUptical depression caUed the scaphoid fossa, which gives at- tachment to the circumflexuspalati muscle. The internal surface of the pterygoid process contributes to form the external wall, and posterior opening of the nasal fossae (h i fiq 25 ). The outer surface of the external plate is broad, forms part of the zygomatic fossa, and gives attachment to the external ptei-ygoid muscle. The base of the pterygoid process is pierced from before backwards by the vidian or pterygoid canal (6 6, fig. U.) : its summit is deeply bifurcated to re- ceive the tuberosity of the palate bone. The internal branch of this bifurca- tion (internal pterygoid plate) is very delicate, and is curved into a hook-like process (s) {hamular process), round which is reflected the tendon of the circuni- flexus OT tensor palati mnscle. , „ , , -j * The anterior or ethmoidal surface of the body of the sphenoid presents, 1 above and in the median Une, a small horizontal projectmg angle (J, figs. 13 and 14.), which articulates with the posterior border of the cribriform nlate of the ethmoid: 2. below this, a vertical ridge (f g, fig. 14,.) con- dnuous with the septum of the sphenoidal sinuses, and articulating with the peipendicular lamella of the ethmoid: 3. on each side, the openmgs of the sphenoidal sinuses (7 7). These are two in number; they are separated froni each Ser by a se7um whiih inclines sometimes to the right side sometmies to he left and are subdivided into a number of irregular cells.

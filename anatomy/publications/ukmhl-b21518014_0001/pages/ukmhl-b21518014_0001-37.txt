GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. IS The canals of the second kind sometimes pass completely through the bone iue canais of^"^ ""r _p,.tebr£c') and they communicate with the spongy Su" 't^c canals of tL th^^^^^^^^^ terminat'e at a greater or less depth in hTcompaSsubstance of the long bones, and in the sp<mgy t^^^^l^^^l^^ Sonbs^^Li^ofrLn^^^ fo^thH-ecepti^n and protection of certain organs; ex. the occipital foss^, which iSe a portion of the cerebellam. 2. For insertion or surfaces of at- rachment as thofe on which muscular fibres are imp anted, as the temporal and nterS foss^ 3. For the transmission of certain organs, such as vessels Enfrves which have to pass into or out of an osseous cavity; such are he Wercanl^ f^^^^^^^ &c. . 4. For -creasing the extent of ^^^^^^^^^ sinuses and ceUs, connected with the organ of smemng, the surface o^ which thev ereatlv enlarge by their numerous anfractuosities. * 5. J<or tne easy passa4 of tendons ^nd sometimes for their reflection, so that the origmal di- Lc ion of the force is changed. To this class belong the bicipital groove of [hfhumerus, that for the tendon of the obturator internus, &c They are gene- ra^y converted into canals by mea^is of fibrous tissue, which hues and com- nletes them. 6. For the nutrition of bones, such being the use of the three orders of nutritious canals already described. We must mention along with these osseous cavities other markings or impressions seen on the siuiace of many bones • for example, the shaUow depressions in the lower jaw bone for the sub- lingual and sub-maxillary glands, the impressions named digital on the internal surface of the cranium. , , i. • i * „r As the eminences of bones have been attributed to the mechanical eflect of muscular traction, so the various unpressions and vascular furrows upon the internal surface of the cranium have been considered to be the result of pressure and pulsation. But it would be more correct to limit ourselves to the simple statement, that the impressions and eminences on the inside of the cranial bones exactly correspond with the elevations and depressions on the surface of the brain, and also that the osseous furrows for the middle meningeal artery cor- rectly represent the ramifications of that vessel. We may here pomt out certain rules to be followed in describing the ex- ternal conformation of bones. 1. In describing the surface of a bone it should be so divided, that the description may comprehend but few objects at a time. Thus a broad bone is to be divided into two surfaces, into angles and borders, which are to be successively studied. 2. The bone being thus subdivided into regions, each of these is then examined, care being taken regularly to proceed from one part to its opposite, i. e. to pass from the superior to the inferior sur- face, and from the anterior to the posterior. This is the only method which in a long description will guard against omissions and avoid tiresome repetitions. 3. It is also of great importance, in considering the objects presented by each region or surface, to foUow an invariable and regularly progressive order. Thus, after exposing the objects placed in front, the examination should be con- tinued uninterruptedly from this point backwards. 4. In the symmetrical bones, it is advisable to describe, first, the objects situated in the median line, and aftei-wards those placed laterally. Internal conformation of bones. The tissue of bones, like that of most other organs, presents the appearance of fibres, whose properties are throughout identical, but which by certain differences in their mode of arrangement, give rise to two forms or modifications of structure. To one of these the name of compact substance has been given ; to the other that of spongy or cancellated sub- stance. A subordinate modification of the latter has long been described under the name of reticular tissue. The spongy or cellular substance has the appearance of cells and areola;, of * [Whatever pthcr purpose they may serve, such cells .ind sinuses are, in most inst.inces, to be regarded as a provision I'or increasing the Irulk and strength of bones witliout u corresponding augmentation of weight.]

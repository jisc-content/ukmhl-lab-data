The upper incisors are distinguished from the W by thiir much greater size, the former being almost twice as large as the latter. In the upper jaw, the middle are distinguished from the '«'^'-° their weU-maiked superiority in size. In the lower jaw, on the contrary, the lateral incisors are the larger, though the difference is but slight. The Canine Teeth {figs. 87, 88.). These are four in number ; two in each jaw. They are situated on either side externally to the incisors, and therefore are nearer to the fulcrum so that hey can OYercome a greater resistance. These teeth are most completely de- veloped in the carnivora. The tusks of the boar and of the elephant are also '"'"'^GmeraUharacters. They are the longest of aU the teeth, both in the crown and n the root; they therefore project a little beyond the mcisors pamcu^rly fn the upper jaw.

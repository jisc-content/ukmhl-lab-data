144 OSTEOLOGY. Comparison of the First Row of the Tarsus with the First Mow of the Carpus. As there are only three hones in the posterior ro-w of the tarsus, which cor- respond to the antihrachial or superior row of the carpus, it might be supposed, a priori, that one of these would correspond to two of the bones of the first row of the carpus. A very slight examination of the tarsus and the carpus in a quadruped will show at once, that the pisiform bone is represented by that part of the os calcis which projects behind the astragalus. The os calcis is the only bone of the tarsus which is developed from two points; and this es- tablishes a strong presumption in favour of the opinion, that it represents two bones. K we admit the analogy of the back part of the os calcis with the pi- siform bone, the anterior portion of this bone would represent the cuneiform or pyramidal bone of the carpus ; and as this last articulates with the os imci- forme so the anterior portion of the os calcis unites with its representative, the cuboid. The os calcis then m.ay be considered as representing the cuneiform and the pisiform bones blended together and much augmented in size. It remains then to establish the analogy between the scaphoid and semilunar bones of the hand, and the astragalus and scaphoid of the foot. The scaphoid of the hand resembles the scaphoid of the foot, both in form and connections. The similarity of shape has led to the identity of name: and with regard to connections, we find that the scaphoid of the foot is at- tached to the three cuneiform bones, and that of the hand to the trapezium, the trapezoid, and the os magnum, which represent the three cuneiform bones; and lastly we observe, that the scaphoid bone of the foot is placed on the same side as the great toe, and that the scaphoid bone of the hand is placed on the same side as the thumb. There is, however, one remarkable difference be- tween them, viz. that the scaphoid bone of the hand articulates with the fore- arm while that of the foot has no connection with the leg. We have now only to discover in the tarsus the representative of the semi- lunar bone AU the rest of the bones being now excluded, we can only con- clude with Vicq-d'Azyr, that the astragalus is its counterpart, with the mere addition of a rounded head. Comparison of the Metacarpus and the Metatarsus. Five small long bones, arranged paraUel to each other, form both the meta- carpus and the metatarsus. In both there are four interosseous spaces : these a?e larger in the hand than in the foot, because there is a greater disproportion between the bulk of the extremities and shafts of the metacarpal than of he metatarsal bones ; the metacarpus, from being shorter, appears broader ban the meta arsus. The most distinguishing character of the metacarpus is the fact, £ the metacarpal bone of the thumb is the shortest of the whole, and is si- Sa ed on a plane anterior to the others ; and that its direction is oblique aU wh ch drc^stances bear reference to the movement of opposition, which is r.v tnTp hand The characteristic mark of the metatarsus is the size Pf.SXst Setatosal bone! which greatly exceeds that of aU the others.

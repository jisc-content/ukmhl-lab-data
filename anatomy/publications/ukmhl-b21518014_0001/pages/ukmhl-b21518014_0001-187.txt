ARTICULATIONS OF THE CRANIUM. 165 M 3 fore, the only movement which remains. In this motion, in which the head describes the arc of a large circle upon the vertebral column, the syndesmo- atlantal ring turns upon the axis as a wheel upon its axle. Of the two plane surfaces of this joint, one glides forwards, and the other backwards • one of the odontoid ligaments is stretched, and the other relaxed. These ligaments, it should be observed, limit the extent of rotation ; but their resistance is oc- casionally insufficient, and the odontoid process breaking one of them slips below the transverse ligament, and occasions death by compressing the spinal cord. Luxation, therefore, of this articulation is to be dreaded, not merely for the same reasons as other dislocations, but as being a cause of compression of the spinal marrow. The entire movement by which the face is turned to either side should not be attributed to this articulation alone, for it extends to the fourth of a circle on each side, and such a degi'ee of motion would dislocate the articular surfaces of the atlas and the axis. Articui/Ations of the Cranium. All the bones of the cranium are united together by synaithroses. We have here to examine, as in all other articulations, L the articular surfaces ; 2. the means of union. As the bones of the cranium form a complete cavity, closed in every direction, they unite by their entire circumferences or by their edges : and as the solidity of joints is in a direct ratio to the extent of the ar- ticular surfaces, the bones of the cranium, which are only in contact by their edges, would have been very slightly connected, had it not been for the follow- ing provisions : 1. The cranial bones are generally thicker at the circumference than in the centre ; 2. They are almost all provided with marginal denticula- tions that multiply the points of contact; 3. The edges, instead of being cut perpendicularly, are bevelled so as to overlap each other, and thereby present much more extensive corresponding surfaces; 4. "We should observe, also, the number of projectmg and retreating angles that are formed by these bones ; and 5. the sinuous arrangement of their edges. We should remark, however, that these different modes of ensuring solidity are not employed indiscriminately over the whole skull. In the vaidt of the cranium, for example, firmness is attained by the mutual adaptation of the serrated margins of the bones at the upper and at the back paits, and by their overlappmg at the sides ; in the base, on the contrary, the solidity chiefly de- pends upon the breadth of the contiguous surfaces, and upon the reception of projectmg mto corresponding retreating angles. Examples of this double arrangement may be seefl in the articulation of the occipital and sphenoid bones, which is accompHshed by means of broad surfaces, and in the articula- tion of the projectmg angle formed by the petrous portion of the temporal bone with the retreatmg angle formed by the occipital bone behind, and the sphenoid in front. *^ This description will suffice to give a general idea of the mode of union between the bones of the cranium. It would evidently exceed the limits of tins work to dilate upon the form of each of the sutures and to follow Munro, m distinguishing fourteen or fifteen different kinds.

PHYSIOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE MUSCLES. 385 the palmar interosseous muscle of the little finger, which represents the adductor pollicis, presents no peculiarities, and is therefore classed with the other palmar interossei. Muscles which move the Foot upon the Leg. These are divided into flexors and extensors: the same muscles also pro- duce, at the articulation of the two rows of the tarsal bones, movements of rotation, which correspond to adduction and abduction. The extensors are, 1. the gastrocnemius and soleus, or the triceps suralis, with which we describe a small rudimentary muscle, the plantaris ; 2. the tibialis posticus; 3. the peroneus longus et brevis. . There is only one flexor, viz. the tibialis anticus. The peroneus tertius, when it exists, is merely a dependence of the extensor longus digitorum. There are no muscles in the leg analogous to the pronators and supinators of the forearm. Muscles which move the Toes. These are divided into extensors and flexors. The extensors are, 1. the conjoined extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius ; 2. the extensor proprius pollicis ; 3. the extensor brevis digitorum. The flexors are, 1. the flexor longus digitorum and its accessories, the lum- bricales; 2. the flexor brevis digitorum ; the flexor longus poUicis. Contrary to what we have seen with regard to the fingers, many of the flexors and extensors of the toes form part of the intrinsic muscles of the foot. As in the hand, the adductors and abductors of the toes occupy the thenar' hypothenar, and interosseous regions. ' The interosseous muscles are adductors and abductors of the toes; they are seven in number, four dorsal, being the abductors, and three plantar, acting as adductors. The superadded muscles of the great toe are, 1. the muscles of the thenar eminence, viz. the abductor brevis and the flexor brevis; 2. the adductor obUquus, and the adductor transversus. The muscles superadded to the Uttle toe are the muscles of the hypothenar eminence, viz. the abductor and the flexor brevis. Cutaneous Muscles. These muscles, which are inserted into the skin by one of their extremities at least, are m the human subject concentrated round the openings in the face with a smgle exception, viz. the palmaris brevis.

It extends from the cfficum to the rectum, and as we have already seen, there is no line of demarcation between these different parts In the first part of its course it ascends vertically, then becomes trans- verse, next descends verticaUy, and is then curved like the Roman letter S, and becomes continuous with the rectum. From this long course, and also from its direction and numerous relations, the colon has been divided into four portions viz. the ascending or right lumbar colon, the transverse colon or arch of the colon, the descending or left lumbar colon, and the iliac colon or sigmoid flexure Each of these parts requires a separate description, at least with re- sard to its relations. Let us first point out the general form of the colon. The colon presents a sacculated appearance throughout, which gives it some resemblance to a chemical apparatus, consisting of a long series of aludels. The sacculi of the colon are arranged in three longitudinal rows, separated by three muscular bands. Each of these rows presents a succession of enlarge- ments and constrictions, or deep grooves, placed across the length of the in- testine. These enlargements and grooves are produced by the longitudinal bands, which being much shorter than the intestine, cause it to be folded in- wards upon itself at intervals. It follows, therefore, that division of these bands by means of a bistoury, or rather their rupture, from great distension of the gut, should destroy this sacculated appearance, and such, indeed, is the result of the experiment; at the same time, the large intestine becomes twice or three times as long as it was before, and forms a regular cylinder, like the small intestine. An incontestable proof of the relation between the cells of the colon and the muscular bands, is the concurrent absence of both in a great number of animals. Lastly, the three rows of sacculi vary much in different subjects, and also in different parts of the great intestine. The descending colon and the sigmoid flexure have only two rows of sacculi, and consequently two intermediate bands. The sacculi almost entirely disappear in the sigmoid flexure. The ascending or right lumbar colon (a, figs. 155. 161.). This portion of the colon is bounded below by the csecum, and above by the transverse arch, with which it forms a right angle, near the gall bladder. It is more or less firmly held in its place by the peritoneum, which in some subjects merely passes in • [Nevertheless, the structure of the mucous membrane in the two situ.itions is very difTerent (see notes, p. •190. 502.).]

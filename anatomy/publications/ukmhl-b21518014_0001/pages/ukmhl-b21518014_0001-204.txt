182 ARTHROLOGY. may take place backwards. It may be remarked that, of all the movements of the shoulder the one described, in which the clavicle is liable to be dislo- cated backwards, is the most uncommon. The movement of circumduction is more extensive forwards and upwards than backwards. The motions at the sterno-clavicular articulation are very circum- scribed in themselves ; but when transmitted by the lever of the clavicle, they become very considerable at the apex of the shoulder. Mechanism, of the Costo-clavicular Articulation. This articulation, which may be regarded as a dependence of the sterno- clavicular, admits of very limited motions, subordinate to those of the joint last described. The ScAPtnLO-HUMEBAL Akticulation (Jigs. 69 and 70.). Preparation. Separate the upper extremity from the trunk, either by dis- articulating the clavicle at its sternal end, or by dividing it through the middle ; 2 Detach the deltoid from its origin; 3. Detach the supra and infra-spmati muscles, the teres minor and subscapularis, proceeding from the scapula to the humerus ; 4. Observe the adhesion of the tendons of these muscles to the cap- sular ligament; 5. Divide the capsule transversely, after having studied its external aspect. , , . The scapulo-humeral articulation belongs to the class ot enarthroses. Articular surfaces. These are the glenoid cavity of the scapula, slightly con- cave of an oval form with the large end downwards, and looking directly out- wards, and the head of the humerus, consisting of about a third of a sphere, and presenting a surface three or four times more extensive than the glenoid cavity. The axis of the head of the humerus forms a very obtuse angle with that of the shaft of the bone. „ ., i. ^i. x,„„a These two surfaces are covered by a layer of caitUage, which, on the head of the humerus, is thicker at the centre than at the circumference; while the reverse obtains in the glenoid cavity. . , , • v Glenoid ligament (a, fig. 70.). This Is a fibrous circle, which suvrou^J the margin of the glenoid cavity, and appears to be formed by the bifurcation of the tendon of the long head of the biceps; but it is also partly composed of fibres proper to itself, which stretch along the margin, arising from one pomt and terminating in another. Notwithstanding this addition, the head of the humerus is still too larffe to be received into the cavity, so that a portion of it is always in contact with the capsular ligament, an inconvenience that is ^ obviated, in some measure, by the existence of a supplementary cavity, as'^e shall Presently see.

16- OSTEOLOGY. an irregular shape and variable size, all of which communicate -with each other, and their walls are partly fibrous, partly lamellar. The compact substance seems to consist of fibres strongly compressed, so as to form a close firm tissue. It is both fibrous and areolar. By means of careful inspection, softening the bone in nitric acid and studying its development, it has been clearly proved that it IS fibrous and that in long bones the fibres are arranged longitudinally, while in broad bones they seem to diverge like rays from the centre to every part of the circumference ; and that in the short bones they are disposed irregularly, so as to form a superficial layer, or crust. The researches of Malpighi have conclusively shown that it is also areolar, or sportgy. By examining a bone softened by nitric acid or studying it in the foetal state, it may be seen that in fact the compact tissue is nothing more than an areolar substance, the meshes of which are extremely close, and much elongated. Accidental ossifications, and the diseases of bone which so frequently exhibit the compact tissue converted into spongy, and the spongy changed into compact, complete the demonstration.* In strictness, therefore, but one form of osseous tissue can be admitted, namely, the areolar, which presents itself under two aspects, sometimes being close, compact, and fasciculated, sometimes spongy and ceOular. Having thus become acquainted with these two forms of osseous tissue, their general ar- rangement in the different kinds of bones is next to be examined. Internal structure of long bones. A vertical section of a long bone presents in the body or shaft a cylindrical cavity, which, in the fresh state, is filled with a soft fatty substance, named the marrow. This cavity, or medullar)/ canal, is of greatest diameter at the middle of the shaft; and as it recedes from this point it is narrowed and intersected at various parts by lamellse detached from the sides, and forming a sort of incomplete partitions. Sometimes, however, there is a complete partition: thus I have seen the cylinder of a femur divided into two distinct halves by a horizontal partition situated precisely in the middle of the bone. The medullary canal is not regularly cyhndrical, nor does it correspond in figure with the external surface of the bone It com- municates with the exterior by means of the nutritious canals, which some- times run for a considerable distance in the substance of the bone, parallel to the medullary cavity, with which they communicate by numerous apertures, and transmit the vessels as far as the extremities of the bone. Some have sup- posed that the cavity existed only in order to receive marrow, while on the other hand it has been maintained, that the marrow existed only to M up the cavitv Whatever be the uses of the marrow, it is certain that the exist- ence of a cavity in the centre of long bones is an advantageous Provision for strength; for it is proved in physics, that of two cyhnders composed of the same ma erial in equal quantity, tie one which is hollow, a^^whose ^^^^ are consequently greater, will offer greater resistance than that which is sohd By the contrivancl therefore, of the medullary canal there is an ^crease of strength without augmentation of weight.

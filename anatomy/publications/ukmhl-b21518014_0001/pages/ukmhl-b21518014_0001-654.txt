T/ie Sub-umbilical portion.—The Supra-umbilical portion General Description and Structure. The peritoneum (■Kepi, around, and r,hw, to extend) is a serous membrane which, on the one hand, lines the abdominal parietes, and on the other invests nearly all the viscera contained in the cavity of the abdomen. As it enters into the formation of almost all the abdominal viscera, it has been already partially examined whilst describing them. It remains for us to demonstrate these parts as a whole, and for this purpose we shall suppose the membrane to commence at one particular point, and shall trace it without in- terruption in a circular course until we again arrive at the point from which we started. The peritoneum is the largest and most compKcated of the serous mem- branes ; It forms, hke all of them, a shut sac, the external surface of which adheres to the parts over which it is reflected, whilst its internal surface is free and smooth. Taking the umbilical region as a point of departure, we shall divide the peritoneum into two portions, a superior, epigastric or supra-umbilical, and an inferior or sub-umbilical portion. The inferior or sub-umbilical portion of the peritoneum. The inferior or sub- umbilical portion, supposed to commence at the umbilicus, lines the whole of the parietes of the abdomen {a, fig. 190.) below that pomt. In so doing it is raised up by the urachus and the two umbilical arteries, or rather by the liga- ments replacing those arteries, so as to form three falciform folds, one median and two lateral, which converge towards their termination at the umbilicus, but diverge in the direction of the bladder; the peritoneum then dips into the pelvis, and covers the fundus, the sides, and the posterior surface of the bladder (6), but to a variable extent, according as that organ is distended or empty. When the bladder is contracted, the peritoneum descends behind the symphysis; * [It has been shown by .Sir A. Cooper, that the- maminary gland of the male has a system of ducts and cells like those of the female gland, but very much smaller.]

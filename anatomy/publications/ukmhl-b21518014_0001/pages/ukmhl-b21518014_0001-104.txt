Cavities of the Face. The study of those bones which we have been engaged in examining, has made us acquainted with the existence of a great number of cavities, which considerably augment the size of the face, and multiply its internal surfaces, without proportionally increasing the weight. ... . , . All the cavities of the face may be reduced to three principal; viz. 1. the orbital cavities: 2. the nasal fossa;, of which aU the sinuses are depend- encies : and 3. the buccal cavity or mouth. The Orbits. These cavities, two in number, have the form of quadrangular pyramids, the axes of which prolonged backwards, would intersect each other m the situation of the seUa turcica. It should, at the same time, be remarked, that the internal wall of the orbit does not participate in this obliquity, but is directed straight from before backwards. We have to consider in each orbit, a superior, an inferior, an external, and an internal waU ; four angles which correspond to the intersec'tionof these surfaces; a base and an apex. ■ e , „„a The superior wall, or roof of the orbit, formed by the frontal bone in front, and by the orbital or lesser wing of the sphenoid behind, is concave, and presents from before backwards, 1. towards the outside, the lachrymal fossa : 2. on the nside the sUght depression in which the pulley for the superior obhque muscle is attached 3. the suture between the lesser wing of the sphenoid and the or- bital Plate of the frontal bone : 4. the foramen opticum. TheZferior wall, or floor, forms a plane inclined outwards and downwards, and pr"sSts from'before backwards, 1. the_ infra-orbital canal: .2 a suture which marks the union of the malar bone with the superior jnaxiUa: 3. the orbhalTurfoce of the superior maxilla: 4. a suture which marks the union of the Superior maxilla with the palate bone: 5. the orbital facette of the palate ^°The external wall, formed by the sphenoid and the malar bone presents an almost vertical suture, which indicates internaUy the spheno-jugal suture. ■ The Internal wall formed by the os unguis, the ethmoid and the sphenoid EHtJi^^r^^S:^^:^— ::peS and two mfenor.

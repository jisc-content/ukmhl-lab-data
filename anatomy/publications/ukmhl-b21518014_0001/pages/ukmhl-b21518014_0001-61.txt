VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 39 cervFcal vertebr.! in the ^^^^f^^^^^^^^^^^^^ in front - ante^o. a postCo. ^'^'^r if :icf r ret"i curvatures already described; 2 4he r^ge of bodies of the vertebree, having the fom of small coiâ„¢ piled on each Xr and separated in the fresh state by certain prominent disks of a Xet?oir'\r^^^^^^^ structm-e. 3. A range of ll^-^^^'^l^^ZTs^^ bodies of the vertebrEE, which are deeper m the aged than m the young subject. , Thk s^foce presents in its tr^ diameters those variations which we have akeady nSd The parts placed in front of the vertebral column are, 1 I^eSdy on its anterior-surface a Ugamentous layer, which completely JnveT it?w th the anterior recti muscles of the head, the longi colli the crura of the diaphragm, and the pso^e muscles. 2. At a greater distance the alimen- tary canal, which rests on the spine at its commencement and termmation, and is attached to it by membranous connexions, even where it advances forwards to form its numerous convolutions. 3. The organs of circulation viz. the hea.rt, the aorta in almost its whole extent, the carotid, vertebral, and common ibac arteries, the vens cava;, the jugular and common iliac vems, the vena azygos, and the thoracic duct. From this position of parts arises the possibihty ol eflfectuaUy compressing the arteries against the vertebral column, a method which has been successfully adopted with the carotid arteries and abdominal aorta It also explains the marked pulsations in the abdominal region frequently observed in emaciated subjects, and often giving rise to an erroneous suspicion of aneurism. 4. The trachea and the lungs. 5. The great sympathetic nerves are connected with it in its entire extent. Posterior surface. This presents, 1. in the median line the row of spinous pro- cesses, the whole of which constitute a vertical crest or ridge denominated spine, and hence the names spinal column and rachis Qaxh, spine). This ridge commences with the tubercle of the fii'St vertebra, is suddenly enlarged at the second, diminishes again at the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebree, and projects anew at the sixth, and more remarkably at the seventh; thence named vertebra prominens. Below this point the processes become oblique, prismatic, triangular, and with one tubercle : their obliquity increases, but they become more slender from the first to the tenth: in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth dorsal, they become horizontal, shorter, and stronger; and they are broad, square, rectangular, and horizontal in the lumbar region. Lastly, the ridge gra- dually sinks down in the sacro-coccygeal region, when it ends by dividing into two smaller ridges, leaving between them a furrow, which is continued aloBg the coccyx. The spinal ridge being the only part of the vertebral column which we can see or feel in the living subject, it is clearly of the greatest importance to study the sUghtest differences which it presents, because it is thus alone that we are able to judge of the extent of deviation of the column; and yet the indications it affords are not absolutely certain, because the pedicles of the vertebrse being susceptible of torsion, a curvature may exist in the bodies of the vertebrae without any corresponding alteration of the spinous processes. 2. On each side of this median ridge are two grooves, broad and shallow in the cervical, broad and deep in the upper part of the dorsal region, contracted at the lower part of the back, enlarged again in the loins and at the base of the sacrum, contracted and finally obliterated at the lower part of this bone. These grooves are filled by a muscular mass, which in robust individuals projects beyond the spine, whilst in those who are emaciated the ridge forms the most prominent part. d4

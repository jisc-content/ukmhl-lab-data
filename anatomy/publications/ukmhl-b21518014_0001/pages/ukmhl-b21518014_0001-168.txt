146 OSTEOLOGY. The metatarsal bones are developed in exactly the same manner as the me- tacarpal, only at a somewhat later period. The union of the epiphyses takes place a little earlier in the metatarsus than in the metacarpus. The toes are ossified at a later period than the fingers; especiaUy the ungual and the second phalanges, which are much later than those of the fingers. It is, no doubt, impossible to state the precise reason for these differences; but it is sufficient to find a positive relation between the rate of development of these parts, and the offices they are intended to fulfil. The Os Hyoides, or the Hyoid Apparatus* {Jig 57.). The OS hyoides has a parabolic form, resembling the upsilon of the Greeks, _ ^ whence its name. It is the only bone which is de- tached from the rest of the skeleton; it is connected only by ligaments and muscles, and is situated be- tween the base of the tongue and the larynx. It is larger in the male than in the female. It is placed almost horizontaUy, the concavity of its curve look- ing backwards, and the convexity forwards. This bone is divided into five parts; viz. a body or _ middle part (a), and/o«r comua, two large (6), and n / N Th-,^ miiltinlicitv of parts, which is much greater in some rmXesp^elialirfi^^^^^^^^ nLe'of hyoid apparatus which we have the substance of the tongue Th s ^^^^ S^^^^^^.e Unes, interrupted muscles, the insertions of y^'''^ Tore or less excavated in difi-erent in- by tubercles.

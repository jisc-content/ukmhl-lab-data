52 OSTEOLOGY. 1. The anterior sphenoid is developed from four points of ossification ; two for the body, and two for the alaj minores.* 2. The posterior sphenoid is also developed from four pomts ; two for the body, and two for the great wings. « • Besides these eight points, there are two others on each side ; one for the m- ternal plate of the pterygoid process, and one for the sphenoidal turbinated bone; so that the whole number of centres of ossification of the sphenoid is ^'^Theosseous points of the great wings are the first to appear: they are visible from the fortieth to the forty-fifth day; a short time afterwards, those of the lesser wings, which are situated on the outside of the optic foramen. At the end ot the second month the osseous points of the body of the posterior sphenoid are distinct; at the end of the third month, those of the body of the anterior sphenoid, and the internal pterygoid plates : the sphenoidal turbinated bones be-in to ossify, according to Beclard, in the seventh month of mtra-uterine life; according to Bertln, in the second year after birth. The two points of the body of the posterior sphenoid are united from the third to the fourth month; the great wings are jomed to the body in the course of five or six months after birth. The two points of the body of the an- terior sphenoid are joined to those of the smaU wings about the third or fourth month; they then unite together in the median plane from about the eighth to he ninth month. The union of the internal pterygoid plates takes place during the sixth month. + The anterior and posterior sphenoid are united from the eightb o the ninth month. The sphenoidal turbinated bones are '^"t Joined to the body of the bone untU from the fifteenth to the eighteenth year. The othei changes which the sphenoid afterwards undergoes, are connected with the de- velopment of the sinuses. It is miited with the occipital bone from the eight- eenth to the twenty-fifth year. The Ethmoid Bone (figs. 15 and 16.)- The ethmoid is so named from the Greek word Wh,, a sieve because it is neSrated wi h a number of foramina : it is placed in the anterior and middle Tan of therase of the cranium, but belongs rather to the face and nasa fossa.

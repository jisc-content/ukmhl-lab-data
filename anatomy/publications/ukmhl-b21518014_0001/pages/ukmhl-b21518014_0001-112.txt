90 OSTEOLOGY. so that their two extremities cannot rest at once upon the same horizontal plane. The point where this torsion exists, is marked on the convex surface by an oblique projecting line, called the angle (h) of the rib; but it is not cor- rect to consider the angle of the rib as resulting from this torsion; it appears to me simply intended for muscular insertions. The ribs have a body and two extremities. The posterior or vertebral ex- tremity is thicker than the rest of the bone, whence it has received the name of head («) (capituluvi costce), and presents two Fig. 39. half surfaces (c c, fig. 39.), of which the upper is smaller than the lower, separated by a horizontal ridge. These two facettes articulate with cor- responding surfaces on the bodies of the dorsal vertebra; {d d, fig. 39.). The head is supported by a constricted portion, the neck {k, fig. 38.), which is flattened from before backwards, and is the weakest part of the bone. It presents behind some inequalities which correspond to the trans- verse process of the dorsal vertebra below. Externally to the neck is an emi- nence known as the tubercle (/1) of the rib ; it is divided into two parts, which are united at an angle, viz. an intei-nal and inferior portion (/) smooth and convex, which articulates with the transverse process of the vertebra below the particular rib examined ; and an external rough portion (I), which gives attachment to ligaments. The tubercle is in general most promment m the "^That'part of the rib which is included between the head and the tubercle (neck cervix), is directed from within outwards, and slightly from above downwards, so as to reach the summit of the transverse process of the ver- tebra below Beyond the tubercle the rib still foUows the same direction for not more than fifteen lines; it is then bent decidedly forwards. The situation of this curve which corresponds with the torsion of the edges above mentioned, is at the angle of the rib. The interval which separates the tuberosity from the angle is the thickest and strongest part of the rib. The rest of the rib, which is before the angle, becomes broader and thinner, and is directed forwards, so that, as HaUer expresses it, the line which it de- scribes represents in some measure the tangent of the posterior curve. The anterior extremity (m) has a hoUowed oval facette for receiving the cartilage. BesTdes the objects we have already described, we observe near the anterior extremity of the rib, an oblique line analogous to that which forms the angle, but much less marked. This Une may be considered as formmg the anterior an^llof the ribs, and like the posterior it is intended for muscular msertions. Irom what ha^ been said, we perceive that the ribs present 1. a posterior extremity or head, supported by a neck; 2. an anterior exfrenu/y united to the l^I^r^aJtUage; 3 a body, having an external or cutaneous surface y^hich is convex anTan internal or pulmonary surface, which is smooth and concave ; TZZ-ior edge which is curved, thick, and rounded; and an tnferwr edge wS has a greater curvature than the superior, is thm and sharp, and marked bv a eroove^or furrow on the inner surface, called the groove of the ribs 39 ) -hich receives and protects the intercostal vessels and nerves tsdy the ribs have a double curvature, one of the surfaces, another of the ^'&Sr ^SXr^^tSS^hind with the dorsal vertebr., in front with the --^f ^^^^^'Is^^ci of a rib resembles a long bone ; but the • ^'™^ f„InLn is analogous to that of flat bones.

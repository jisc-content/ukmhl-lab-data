ARTICULATIONS OF THE ANKLE JOINT. 315 P 4 dium vel perpendiculare, m. Jigs. 79 and 80.), is situated beneath the sheath of the peroneus longus and hrevis. It arises from the summit of the external maUeolus, is directed downwards and slightly backwards, to be attached to the outside of the os calcis. It is rounded and composed of parallel fibres. 2. The anterior externallateralligame7U(]iga.mentam&hu\w: a.nten\xs,n,Jig. 80.), arises from the anterior edge of the external malleolus, and proceeding downwards and forwards is fixed to the astragalus in front of its external mal- leolar facette. It is very short, and broader below than above: it forms one of the two anterior ligaments described by Bichat in this joint. 3. Thepostei-ior lateraUiga7nent(]igamentnmGbulgs posterius, o,Jig. 79.) is very deeply seated behind; it extends from the excavation on the inside and behind the external malleolus to the posterior border of the astragalus. It is directed abnost horizontally, or in a slight degree obliquely downwards and inwards, and is almost parallel to the posterior ligament of the lower peroneo-tibial ar- ticulation. It is composed of very distinct parallel fibres. Bichat calls it the posterior ligament of the joint. The internal lateral ligament is much stronger than the three external ligaments taken together. It is composed of two very distinct layers: 1. a superficial layer, consisting of fibres stretched from the apex and the an- terior and posterior borders of the internal maUeolus to the os calcis, and the upper edge of the lower calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, which it maintains in a state of constant tension. The fibres are long, and slightly divergent, but still sufficiently so to have given origin to its name of the deltoid ligament (p, figs. 79 and 80.). The fibres which are most anterior pass directly forwards to the neck of the astragalus and to the scaphoid; they form a very thin layer which has been improperly called the anterior ligament of the ankle-joint. 2. Below the above is a deep layer of much greater extent, composed of short and strong bundles, passing downwards and outwards from the summit and sides of the internal malleolus, to the inner surface of the astragalus, below the articular facette.* Synovial capsule. The external surface of this membrane is brought into view in front and behind, by removing the tendons and their sheaths ; and if the external and internal lateral ligaments be divided, it wiU be seen to extend into the inferior peroneo-tibial articulation. It will also be observed that it is tense at the sides, but very loose behind, and more particularly so in front. A great quantity of adipose tissue covers its external surface in these situa- tions. Mechanism of the Ankle-joint. This articulation not only constitutes the point at which the weight of the body IS transmitted to the foot, but also performs a very active part in the movements of progression; it is therefore so constructed as to unite great strength with the capability of tolerably extensive motion. With regard to strength, the foUowing arrangements should be noticed as especiaUy advantageous : L The leg being articulated with the foot at a right angle, transmits the weight of the body directly to it, and this transmission being effected in the perpendicular direction, i. e. in a direction in which the articular surfaces mutuaUy oppose each other, has no tendency either to pro- les in^^^' °J ^? ■''"'^ ligaments.

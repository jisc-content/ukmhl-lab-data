MYOLOGY. 266 upwards. It is not uncommon to find another small digastric fasciculus witli a separate tendon, on the anterior surface of the muscle. Relations. The complexus is covered by the trapezius, splenius, longissimus dorsi, transversalis colli, and trachelo-mastoid, and covers the transveiso- spmalis and the recti and obliqui capitis. Its inner edge is separated from the muscle of the opposite side by a considerable quantity of adipose tissue, and by a prolongation of the ligamentum nuchse. The Interspmales Colli. The interspinales muscles are distinct in the neck only. It is generally ad- mitted that there are five pairs, the first of which extends between the axis and the third cervical vertebra, and the last between the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebrae. They are small quadrilateral muscles extending from one of the borders of the groove in the spinous process below, to the corre- sponding lip of the next process above. Externally they are in relation with the transverso-spinaUs, and are separated from each other intemaUy by ceUular tissue and an aponeurotic lamina. Fig. 108 The Recti Capitis Postici, Major and Minor. The rectus capitis posticus major {e,fy. 108.).may be regarded as an axoido- occimtal and the rectus minor (rf) as an atloido-occipital inter-spinxihs muscle. occipital, ana ^^^k j^,^^ ^^^^^^^^^^ ^he smaUer from the tubercle on the posterior arch of the atlas, and the greater from the superior tubercle of the spinous process of the axis ; and increasing in size, they both pass obliquely upwards and outwards. The rectus major, which is much the larger and more oblique, is inserted to the outer side ot the inequalities situated below the inferior semi-circular line of the occipital bone; the rectus minoris inserted to their inner side. The name of recti is not therefore very appropriate, for both of them (but more especiaUy the arger one) are directed obUquely ; but they are so called in contra-distinction to two neighbouring muscles ^tich are much more obUque. The obliquity of these muscles (by increasing their length) allows of more extended movements, and at the same time enables them to assist in rotating the head.

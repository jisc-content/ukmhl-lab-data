It is a broad triangular, rather than trapezoid muscle, thick in the middle, thin and elongated at its superior and inferior angles. Attachments. It arises from the spinous pro- cesses of all the dorsal and the seventh cervical vertebra, from the corre- sponding supra-spinous ligaments, from the pos- terior cervical ligament (ligamentum nuchse),and from the internal third of the superior occipital line, and is inserted into the entire length of the spine of the scapula, into the posterior border of the acromion, and into the external third of the posterior border of the clavicle. The fixed at- tachments or origins of this muscle present, 1. a broad, semi-elliptical aponeurosis, which when united to the one on the opposite side, foiTus an ellipse, occupying the space between the sixth cervical and the third dorsal vertebrae; 2. a very thin fibrous lamina, not having the ordinary shining appearance of an aponeurosis, which is fiirmly ad- herent to the skin, and forms the truncated occipital angle of the muscle; 3. a great number of tendinous fibres, constituting all those attachments to the ver- tebrae, that are independent of the two preceding aponeuroses. From these origins all the fleshy fibres proceed outwards, the inferior fibres from below up- wards, the superior from above downwards, and from behind forwards, and the middle ones horizontally. They tenninate in the following manner: — the

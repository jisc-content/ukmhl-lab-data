We also find the orifices of mucous crypts or lacunee, and some parallel lon- sSJI""'it is muscular and erectile, like the membranous portion of the male urethra. It is surrounded by a thick layer of circular muscular fibres, which seem to be continuous with the fibres of the bladder, some of the lon- gitudinal fibres of that organ being prolonged upon the outside of these. A thin layer of spongy or erectUe tissue Ues subjacent to the mucous membrane, which is very thin. The Vulva. Under the term vulva we include all the external genitals of the female; viz the mons Veneris, the labia majora and minora, the clitoris, and the meatus urinarius, to which we may add the orifice of the vagina already described. The mons Veneris is a rounded eminence, more or less prominent m different individuals, situated in front of the pubes, and surmounting the vulva; the prominence of this part is owing partly to the bones, and partly to a collection of fatty tissue beneath the skin; it is covered with hair at the time of puberty. The labia majora are two prominent cutaneous folds, which form the limits of an antero-posterior opening, by most anatomists named the vulva. They are flattened transversely, and are thicker in front than behind; their external surfaces are covered with hairs; their internal surfaces are moist and smooth, and in contact with each other; their free borders are convex and provided with hair ; their anterior extremities are continuous with the mons Veneris ; their posterior extremities unite to form a commissure called the fourchette, which is almost always lacerated in the first labour. The interval between the fourchette and the anus constitutes the perineum, which is generally from eight to ten lines long. The interval between the fourchette and the entrance of the vagina is called the foSsa navicularis. The constituent parts of the labia majora are, a cutaneous layer, a mucous layer, both provided with numerous sebaceous follicles, f In fat persons, a great quantity of adipose tissue, a layer of dartoid tissue next the mucous membrane, and some arteries, veins, lymphatics, and nerves. They are there- fore very analogous to the scrotum in the male, and, like it, are liable to serous infiltration in anasarca. The labia minora, or nymphts, are seen after separating the labia majora, under the form of two layers of mucous membrane; they are narrow behind, * [The female urethra perforates the triangular ligament precisely in the same way as the membranous portion of the urethra in the male ; and moreover, between the two layers of the ligament it is surrounded by muscular fibres corresponding exactly with the compressor urethra; in the male sex. The vertical fibres, or Wilson's muscles, were noticed by him (toe. cit.), descending from the symphysis, separating on the urethra, and passing around it; the transverse fasciculi, which are often very large, form together the depressor urethrce of San- torini, and were described and figured by that author (06s. Anat.) as arising by a broad tendon from the lower part of the rami of the pubes, above the crectores clitoridis, passing obliquely upwards and inwards, and uniting with each other above the urethra. Mr. Guthrie has shown (/oc. oil.) that the relations of the vertical and transverse fasciculi to each other, to the urethra, and to the layers of the trianguKar ligament, are precisely tlie same as in the male.] ■f- It is not rare to see small and very short hairs growing from the sebaceous follicles on the inner surface of the labia miijora ; they arc analogous to those of the caruncula; lachrymales.

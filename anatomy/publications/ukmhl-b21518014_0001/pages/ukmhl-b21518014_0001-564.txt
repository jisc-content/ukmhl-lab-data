The quantity of blood wh"ch passes through It Its entirely vascular structure, and\he physical qualities Tthe splenic pulp prove on the one hand, that the blood sent to the spleen serves other purposes besides that of nutrition; and on the other, that it undergoes some important changes, of which we are completely ignorant, because^the means of analysis are wanting; but whatever they may be, they have un- doubtedly some connection with the functions of the liver* for in aU animals possessmg a spleen, even though its arterial blood does not come to it from the same trunk as the hepatic artery, the veins of the spleen terminate in the venous system of the hver. It is therefore extremely probable, that the spleen perforins an important office in the abdominal venous system; but what this oflice is we do not know ; and what tends to confound aU our calculations is, that extirpation of this organ in animals does not seem to have any marked eflect upon their health, that the most complete atrophy of the spleen is consistent with the most regular performance of all the functions, and that hy- pertrophy even to such a degree that the organ occupies ahnost the whole ot the abdomen, merely produces a discolouration of the skin, diminished nutrition, and, in young subjects, an arrest of growth. The spongy and vascular texture of the spleen, and the absence of valves, which aUows the venous blood to regiu-gitate into the spleen when there is any obstacle to the circulation, has led to the opinion that the spleen is nothing more than a diverticulum intended to restore the equilibrium of the abdominal venous system whenever it is deranged; and this opinion, which we owe to Haller, is pretty generally admitted.! A modification of this opinion is, that the spleen fulfils, with regard to the circulation in general, and especially to the abdominal circulation, the office of the safety-tube of Wolf in chemical apparatus. It is certain that compression of the splenic vein in a living animal causes tumefaction of the spleen, which gives place to a quick collapse, as if by elastic contraction, when the pressure on the vein is removed : it is certain that the whole structure of the spleen indicates that this organ may undergo alterations of expansion and tm-gescence and of collapse and flaccidity ; and it is known, that, during intermittent fever, the spleen may be felt below the false ribs, &c. But all this leads to presumptions, and not to certainty. From the preceding considerations it would follow, that the spleen is only an accessory organ. ' * We cannot state with Malpighl, that the spleen is the preparatory organ of the bile, be- cause we have seen that it is extremely probable that the liver is concerned in the process of sanguification. t May we not quote in support of this view, the pain felt in the region gf the spleen, after violent running, which can only be referred to extreme distension of this organ.

Like that canal, it is ti"ecteci obujudy upwards, outwards, and backwards, and is from an inch and a ha f to two inches and a half in length.

Having arrived opposite and internaUy to the entrance of the ureter into he bladder, it is directed horizontaUy inwards and a httle forwards hke the vesicula seminalis (s, figs. 181. 186.), internally to which it is situated, and graduaUy approaches nearer and nearer to its fellow of the opposite side, with which it seems to be joined. At the anterior extremity of the vesicda semi- nalis, it unites at an acute angle with the efferent duct (c, fig. 186.) of the latter, the union of the two forming the ejaculaiory duct (d). In its vesical portion, for about two inches above the vesiculse seminales, the vas deferens is con- siderably dilated, and at the same time its parietes become thinner. On the inner side of the vesicula seminalis the canal still continues dilated, and is sometimes sacculated, and has a flexuous appearance. Each sacculus is formed by a small ampulla, which opens into the cavity of the canal. The vas deferens forms, therefore, in this situation, a sort of provisional reservoir, resembling in its internal aspect and structure the vesiculse semi- nales. The spermatic cord, or cord of the spermatic vessels, is formed by the sper- matic artery * and veins, the lymphatic vessels, the spei-matic plexus of nerves, a branch of the genito-crural nerve, and the vas deferens, all being surrounded by the cremaster muscle and the common fibrous coat. Structure. The following are the principal points concerning the structure of the vas deferens. It is harder than any other excretory duct, and it can be recognised by the touch among the other constituent parts of the cord, both in the healthy and in the diseased state, in which latter condition it may become considerably enlarged. It is perfectly cylindrical. Its bore is so small that it is almost capillary, and will scarcely admit Mejan's probe. Its parietes are thick, and contrast singularly with the fineness of its bore. Several anatomists admit the existence of circular and longitudinal muscular fibres in this duct. Leuwenhoek demonstrated longitudinal fibres, with circular fibres beneath them. All that I have been able to discover in the human vas deferens, even by the aid of the glass, are circular. In their appearance, and kind of cohesion, they present much analogy to muscular fibres; but it is in the larger animals only, in the horse for example, that their muscularity can be clearly ascertained, and that we find distinctly a very thin longitudinal and superficial layer of fibres, with very thick and strong circular fibres beneath. The internal surface of the vas deferens is white, rough, and alveolar; its roughness is due to small and very white fibrous fasciculi, some of which are * [Also the deferential artery, and the cremaslLric branch of the epigastric artery.]

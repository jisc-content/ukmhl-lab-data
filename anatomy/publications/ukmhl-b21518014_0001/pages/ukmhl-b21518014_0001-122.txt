100 OSTEOLOGY. The clavicle has only one primitive osseous point; from the age of fifteen to twenty-eight years, a complementary or epiphysary point is developed under the form of a very thin plate at the anterior part of the sternal end. Fig. 4-i Tlie Scapula {fig. 4-2.). The scapula, or shoulder blade, forms in man the back part of the shoulder ; in a great number of animals it constitutes the en- tire shoulder. Placed like a sort of shield upon the back part of the thorax, for which it serves as a means of protection against external violence, this bone corresponds with the lateral part of the spine, which it approaches or quits according to the dif- ferent movements of the upper extremity, to which it affords a moveable point of attachment. The scapula is proportionally larger in man than in the lower animals. It is an asymmetrical bone, broad, thin, and triangular, presenting two surfaces, three borders, and three angles. The anterior or costal surface is moulded as it were upon the thorax ; it is concave, the concavity bemg named the sub-scapular fossa. In this we observe ridges directed obliquely from above downwards, and from without inwards.* In a weU formed subject, this surface should be exactly fitted to the surface of the thorax; but when the chest is contracted, as in Jbthisical patients, the scapula does not partici- nate in an equal degree in this alteration, and there is consequently a dispio- p'S-Uon and ^ange^of relative position, to suchadegree tjat t^^ ^^I^^^ Z tiStrcetre^^tioT^^^^^^^^^ ^^^St:4^^Sr(^...) is divided ^^^^^ even in very corpulent individuals. external and the posterior &,pos the summit and because this pi ocess fmms th^^ shUer.

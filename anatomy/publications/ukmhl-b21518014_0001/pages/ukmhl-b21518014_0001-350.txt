This thick bundle of tendons having reached the palm of the hand, is then distributed in a manner to be noticed after the description of the flexor profundus, with the tendons of which those of the flexor sublimis are intimately connected. Relations. It is covered by the pronator teres, the flexor carpi radialis, the palmaris longus, the flexor carpi ulnaris, and the fascia of the fore-arm ; and it covers the flexor profundus digitorum, from which it is separated by the ulnar vessels and nerves: it also covers the median nerve, and the flexor longus pollicis, to which it generally sends a tendinous and fleshy prolongation. The Flexor Profundus Digitorum. Dissection. This muscle is exposed by cutting across the flexor sublimis and the flexor carpi ulnaris. The flexor profundus or perforans (i, figs. 119, 120.) is situated under the superficisd flexor, which it exceeds in size, but resembles it in being divided below into four portions. Attachments. It arises from the upper three fourths of the internal and anterior surfaces of the ulna, from a well- marked cavity situated on the inner side of the coronoid process behind the rough eminence which gives attach- ment to the internal lateral ligament of the elbow, from the inner two thirds of the interosseous ligament, from that part of the fascia of the fore-arm which covers the inner surface of the ulna, and lastly, by a few fibres, from within and below the biciajtal tuberosity of the radius. It is in- serted into the fronfof the bases of the last phalanges of the fingers {i,figs. 119, 120.). The fleshy fibres arise directly from these numerous origins, and proceed vertically downwards, the internal fibres alone being directed somewhat obliquely forwards and out- wards. The belly of the muscle thus formed continues to increase in size, and is then divided into four unequal portions, each constituting a semi-penniform muscle. These four small muscles are in juxta-position, and termi- nate in as many flat tendons, which occupy the lower two thirds of the anterior surface of the entire muscle, and are remarkable for being divided into very regular and closely united parallel bands of a nearly white colour. The four tendons emerging from the fleshy fibres at various heights, but always above the anterior annular ligament ot the carpus, pass under this ligament conjointly with the ten- dons of the flexor sublimis, the flexor pollicis longus and the median nerve. In this situation they are placed behind the tendons of the the meaian "er-^^- arraneed in two layers, as we have already seen.

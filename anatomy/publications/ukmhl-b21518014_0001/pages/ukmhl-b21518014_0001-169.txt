147 OS HYOIDES. gives attachment to a ligament, which unites it with the styloid process. This ligament, which is sometimes ossified in man, is always a bony connection in the lower animals. * Internal structure. The hyoid bone is composed chiefly of compact tissue; but there is a small quantity of spongy tissue in the thick parts of the body and the great comua. Developmeiit. The os hyoides is developed from five pomts; one for the body, two for the great comua, and two for the little cornua. Some anato- mists admit two points for the body, and make the whole number six. The ossification of the great cornua precedes that of the body, which be- comes bony soon after birth; the little comua are not ossified until some months after. All the pieces are at first separated by considerable portions of cartilage, afterwards by a very thin layer, which sometimes remains during life, and gives the difierent parts of the bone a great degree of mobility. â€¢ In the lower animals the styloid process is detached from the cranium, and forms one of the hyoid chain of bones, which is composed, I. of the five pieces of the os hyoides ; 2. of the bones which supply the place of the styloid ligaments: 3. of the styloid processes, or rather bones: nine pieces in all.

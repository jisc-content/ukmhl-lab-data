The muscular coat is formed of interlacing fibres, the direction of which it is, at first sight, very difficult to determine, f This coat is very thin, and does not form a continuous layer m enlarged bladders ; but in small and contracted bladders it is contmuous, and consists of several layers, and may even acquire a thickness of eight or ten lines from hypertrophy. It is then very easy to determine the direction of the fleshy fibres which seem to form a number of layers. The external layer consists of longitudinal fibres, all of which pro- ceed from the neck of the bladder, and expand over the whole surface of the I hnv" not. uncommon to find the bladder forming behind the trigone a deep cul-de-sac, which I liave seen insinuated between tliat part and tlic rectum. i ui scLed inllien'Se.'^plTaG.]'' ""^ "^""'^^ '"icroscopic characters of which are dc-

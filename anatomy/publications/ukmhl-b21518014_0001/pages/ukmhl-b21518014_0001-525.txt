The word anus, borrowed from the Latm, sigmfies the lower orifice of the alimentary canal (the anal orifice); it is a narrow but dilatable opening, through which the faeces are expeUed. • . ^ It is situated in the median line, about an inch in front of the point of the coccyx, at the back part of the perineum, between the tuberosities of the ischium, and at the bottom of the fissure between the buttocks. The skin around the borders of this orifice, which is constantly closed, contains a great number of sebaceous follicles, and is covered with hair m the male ; it passes deeply into the orifice to become continuous with the mucous membrane, and presents a great number of radiated folds, which are efi'aced durmg dilatation. The point at which it becomes continuous with the mucous membrane is de- serving of notice ; it is within the rectum, at the distance of some hnes from the anus properly so called, and is marked by a waved line, which forms a series of arches or festoons having their concavities directed upwards. Some- times there are small pouches in the situation of these arches, opening up- wards. From the angles at which the arches unite, some mucous folds pro- ceed, and small foreign bodies detached from the faces ai-e often retamed in the culs-de-sac, and become the causes of fistulse. Structure of the anus. The anus, intended as it is to prevent the revolting inconvenience of a constant and involuntary escape of the fa3ces, consists essentially of a sphincter muscle, which is antagonised not only by the proper dilator, viz. the levator ani, with which I connect the ischio-coccygeus, but also by the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles. The absence of a sphincter is the great evil of every artificial anus. A fourth muscle, the transversalis perinei, must also be included among the muscles of the anus. The skin and the mucous membrane which cover these muscles are remark- able for the great developement of the erectile tissue, which forms the basis of all tegumentary membranes. The terminal branches of the hEemorrhoidal arteries are extended upon this portion of the skin and mucous membrane. From this erectile and therefore vascular tissue arise a great number of winding, twisted, and plexiform veins, which form the lowest roots of the vena porta;. A considerable number of cerebro-spinal and ganglionic nerves, derived from the sacral plexus and the hypogastric nervous centre, are dis- tributed around this orifice. Lastly, there are mucous crypts, or rather glands, a vestige of the highly developed glandular organ found in some animals. Muscles of the anus. We now proceed to the description of the muscles of the anus, which are six in number, viz. two single muscles, the sphincter and the transversalis perinei; and two pairs, the leva tores ani and the ischio-coccygei, which in fact form but one muscle. The sphincter internus of authors is nothing more than the last ring of the circular fibres of the rectum. The Sphincter Ani. Dissection.

OSTEOLOGY. 30 long, narrmv, and thin lamina:, inclined so as to become imbricated. 2. Dorsal region: — Spinous processes, prismatic and irianyular, long, oblique, and tubercu- lated at their summit, with short vertical lamina:. 3. Lumbar regiou: — Spinous processes quadrilateral, strong, and horizontal, with very short, thick, and vertical lamina:. It is possible tben from the spinous process and its laminae alone to determine tbe region of any vertebra. T/ie Articular Processes in the different Regions. In tbe cervical region (5 5,Jigs. 2 and 3.) the articular processes form small columns, and are so directed that their articular surface makes with the hori- zon an angle of about 45°: the superior look upwards and backwards, the inferior downwards and forwards. It is important to remark this direction, because it permits the movements of flexion, extension, and lateral inclina- tion : it is owing to the same circumstance also, that luxations of the cervical vertebrsB may occur without fracture of their articular processes. It shoydd be also observed, that the articular surfaces of the right and left sides are in the same plane. 2. In the dorsal region (5 5, Jig. 4.) the articular processes are simple la- mina, the direction of which is vertical and the surface plane. The superior look backwards and outwards, the inferior forwards and inwards. The articular facette of the right side is not on the same plane as that of the left. T should observe, that in certain cases the dorsal articular processes are found as it were locked together, the extremity of the superior process being received into a deep notch on the surface of the inferior process of the vertebra above. . , 3 In the lumbar region (5 5, fig. 5.) the articular processes are very strong, with curved surfaces. The superior concave look backwards and inwards ; the inferior convex, forwards and outwards. They both represent two seg- ments of a cylinder, one of which completely surrounds the other, or rather the inferior resemble half hinges, which are received into the half rings formed by the superior processes. It should be observed here, that the supe- rior articular processes are prolonged by certain tubercles, to which the name of apoplu/sary may be correctly applied, and whkh serve for the msertion of muscles. To sum up then what has been said : The cervical articular processes are small columns, cut with plane faces a t an inclination of 45°, those of both sides on the same plane ; the dorsal are thin lamina:, plane and vertical, but not in the ..ame plane; the lumbar strong, vertical, and tnberculated lamincB, with a curved articular surface. The region of any given vertebra may be easily recognised from its articular processes alone. The Transverse Processes in the different Regions of the Spine.

128 OSTEOLOGY. downwards. Into this nutritious canal, which is perhaps the largest of any in the long bones, I have seen a nervous twig enter, accompanying the nutritious artery. 4. From the oblique line to the lower end of the tibia, the posterior surface of this bone is smooth, of almost uniform diameter, and divided through- out its length by a more or less marked vertical line. The anterior edge (c c) is placed immediately under the skin, beneath which It may be readily felt *: its lower fourth is round and blunt, the upper three fourths are sharp, and hence it has been called the crest of tJie tibia. Its upper part inclines somewhat outwards, its lower part inwards. The external edge (g k) gives attachment to the interosseous ligament; it is bifurcated below, and thus forms the two boundaries of an airticular cavity which we shall notice in describing the lower end of the tibia. The internal border (ft), much less sharp than the others, afifordB insertion to several muscles. The upper or femoral extremity {f g) of the tibia is at least double the size of the lower, and is larger in a transverse direction than from before backwards; on it we observe two concave articular surfaces, of an oval shape, with their long diameter directed from behind forwards. They have been improperly denominated condyles; a more correct name would be glenoid cavities of the tibia. These surfaces, which articulate with the condyles of the femur, are not per- fectly alike; the internal is longer, narrower, and deeper than the external. They are separated by a pyramidal eminence surmounted by two sharp tu- bercles. This eminence, which is called the spine of the tibia (e), is nearer the posterior than the anterior part of the bone. In front and behind this spine are two rough depressions, which give attachment to the crucial ligaments. The glenoid cavities are supported by two considerable enlargements, called tuberosities of the tibia. . The internal tuberosity (/), larger than the external, presents behmd a hori- zontal groove, into which one of the divisions of the tendon of the semi-mem- branosus is inserted. The external tuberosity (g) presents at its back part a small almost circular facette, which articulates with a correspondmg surface on the fibula. The two tuberosities of the tibia are separated behind by a consi- derable excavation. In front they are separated by a triangular surface, pierced by vascular foramina, and terminating below in an eminence, called an<enor tuberosit,/ of the tibia (A). This tuberosity, below which the crest of the bone commences, is rough and prominent below, where it gives attachment to the tendon of the extensor muscles of the leg, ligamentum patelttB; and smootn above where it is separated from the same tendon by a synovial bursa. A pro- iecting line runs outwards from this tuberosity, and termmates above in a tubercle, which is very prominent in some individuals, and may be easily lelt under the skin. It gives origin to part of the tibiaUs anticus. The lower or tarsal extremity (I k) of the tibia is almost square, having, hke the upper, its greatest diameter transversely. We observe on it a quadrilateral articX cavity (0, transversely oblong, broader on the outside than on the L drLd di^ded by an antero-posterior ridge, into two unequal parts.

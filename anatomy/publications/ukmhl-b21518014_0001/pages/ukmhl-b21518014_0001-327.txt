THE BUCCINATOK. 305 halves, each constituted by a demi-zone, of semi-elliptical concentric fibres, terminating on either side at the commissures of the lips. These fibres, which are all fleshy, do not become continuous opposite the commissures of the lips ; but only intersect each other, those of the upper half being continuous with the lower fibres of the buccinator, and those of the lower half with the upper fibres of the same muscle. The thickness of the two halves varies in different individuals, particularly around the free borders of the lips, where the fasciculi of the muscle are some- what everted. In the negro this is very remarkable. The thickness of the lips depending upon this circumstance must be distinguished from that which is the effect of a scrofulous habit. jRelalions. These muscles are covered by the skin, to which they adhere intimately, and hence the facility of bringing together the entire depth of the surface of wounds in the lips, by retentive applications to the skin only. They cover the mucous membrane, but are separated from it by the labial glands, the coronary vessels, and a great number of nervous filaments. Their outer circumference receives all the extrinsic muscles of the lips, which terminate in these as in a common centre. Their inner circumference circumscribes the opening of the mouth. The differences in the dimensions of this opening occasion the varieties observed in the size of the mouth, but the capacity of the buccal cavity is in no way influenced by these variations. Actions. These are exceedingly various, and may be studied as connected with the closing of the mouth, with the prehension of aliments by suction, with the playing upon wmd instruments, and with the expression of the coun- tenance. I shall here only notice the shutting of the mouth. _ This may be accomplished simply by the approximation of the jaws, which IS followed by a corresponding motion of the lips. In active occlusion, or that dependent on the orbicularis, two things may happen—either the lips may be closely drawn against the teeth, and their free edges applied to each other or they may be pushed forwards and puckered; in the latter case the buccal opening, which is usuaUy represented by a transverse line, resembles a circular or rather a lozenge-shaped orifice. The Buccinator. Dissection.

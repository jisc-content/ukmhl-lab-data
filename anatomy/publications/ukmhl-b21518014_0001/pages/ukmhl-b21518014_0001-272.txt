Braconnot. {Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. torn, viii.)* In addition to the tendinous and fleshy fibres, vessels, nerves, and cellular tissue also enter into the composition of muscles. We have already described the disposition of the cellular tissue contained in these organs; the mode of distribution of their vessels and nerves will be more appropriately alluded to in the description of the vascular and nervous systems.f Uses of Muscles The muscles are the active organs of motion, constituting the source of the power that is applied to the various levers represented by the component parts of the skeleton. The movements produced are the result of that peculiar pro- perty possessed by the muscles, of shortening themselves, which is called muscular contractility {myotilM). The shortening of a muscle is termed its contraction, and the opposite state its relaxation. Phenomena of muscular contraction. During contraction the muscular fibres become folded in a zig-zag manner throughout their entire length; the muscle itself becomes hardened, and broader and thicker in proportion to the amount smaUer elementary parts named ^tamenis (the primitive fibres of MiiUer). All these elements of the muscular tissue extend parallel to each other, from one tendinous attachment to another, never having been seen to bifurcate or coalesce. In man the. fibres vary from J^th to gigth of an inch in diameter; the transverse stnse upon them are parallel, generally straight, but occasionally slightly waved or curved ; they are situ- ated at intervals of from .jjLjjth to ij^th of an inch. . . , • The fflamen<s are varicose or beaded, /. e., alternately enlarged and contracted; their diameter is from -r^th to rJn^th of an inch. According to the general opinion, they are held together n each^e by Ss of a glutinous substance, which latter, according to Skey, constitutes the entire centre of the fibre, the circumference alone being occupied by the filaments In the arvl of tasects a delicate membranous sheath, sometimes observed projecting beyond the flla- ments has been described by Schwann as forming a proper investment of the fibre; and by SoeV this is also presu^ exist in man and the other vertebrata.. Be this as it may, it is rertSf tharthe fibres have no separate sheaths of cellular tissue derived from the common XeaTh of tSe muscle! the prolongations of which appear to extend only so far as to enclose the '"Thirause of'the striated appearance has perhaps not been quite satisfactorily ascertained; but sIncrthTenlargeraents on the varicose filaments are darker than the constricted portions, and s nee thev arl sTtS at intervals precisely similar to those between the transverse str.£e of the Zr^nonmne fibre and from some other additional considerations it has been supposed, with g?eafprobabmty to result from the enlarged and dark portions of the filaments being arranged iliS«s,infof^^^^^^^^ '=i"f'}^hi\"*^^^^^^ Water , " ^ ^ . 15-8 Fibrin (with vessels and nerves) - '1° Cellular tisMB convertible into gelatin - - ' ' Albumen and colouring matter - ..

It is inserted into the back of the olecranon. The origin of the middle or long head (which we shaU find to be analogous to the rectus cruris) *, consists of a tendon that is blended with the glenoid ligament, nearly in the same manner as the long tendon of the biceps. This tendon is flattened from before backwards, and soon splits into two layers, united by their outer edges, the posterior of which is thin and short, while the anterior is very thick, especially at its outer edge, and prolonged to the middle of the muscle. The head of the humerus, therefore, is bound by the long head of the triceps below, in the same manner as by the long tendon of the biceps above. The fleshy fibres arise from between the two layers above mentioned, and form a bundle flattened in front and behind, which immediately turns upon itself, so that its anterior surface becomes posterior, and vice versa. From this sort of torsion the strongest layer of the tendon, which was originally in front, eventually occupies the posterior surface of the muscle. The fleshy fibres arising from between the two layers, and especially from the anterior sur- face and borders of the now posterior tendon, pass downwards and a little outwards, to be inserted, some into the anterior but the greater number into the posterior surface of an aponeurotic expansion, the external border of which is continuous with a similar structure belonging to the external division of the muscle. The aponeurotic fibres are collected together into a very thick tendon, which is folded into a semi-cone, within which the fleshy fibres termmate ; the tendon itself is inserted by a thick mass into the inner and back part ot the olecranon, on the outer side of the internal portion of the muscle, and closely united with the posterior aponeurosis of the external portion. A sj-novial capsule intervenes between this tendon and the olecranon. a-„\a^ The origins of the external and internal portions from the humerus divide between themselves, so to speak, the posterior surface of that bone, to which the lone head has no attachments. , , . , , , external head if, figs. 116, 117.), which is larger than the m ernal, and from LaloS may be ti;med the vastus exiernus of the triceps brachu (cubitum exTudeS secundus, Vesalius; ancone externe, Winslow), arises partly bf flesSSpartly by endinous fibres.

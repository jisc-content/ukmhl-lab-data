82 OSTEOLOGY. at this point, for the anterior portion of the foramen (f,g,f) gives lodgment to the odontoid process of the second vertebra, so tliat the antero-posterior diameter of the part which contains tlie spinal cord does not greatly exceed that of the foramen in the succeeding vertebra;. The transverse diameter alone is more considerable, whence the possibility of lateral displacements or incomplete luxations of the first upon the second vertebra without any marked compression of the cord. The notches (A/i) are situated on the posterior arch at its junction with the lateral masses. They are posterior to the articular processes, whilst in aU the other vertebra; they are anterior. The superior are very deep, often con- verted into a foramen by a bridge of bone, and seem to be continuous with the foramen in the base of the transverse process, by means of a horizontal groove which winds round behind the articular process. This groove is sometimes almost converted ijito a complete canal. From the union of these parts, viz. the notch, groove, and foramen, a twisted canal results, vertical at first and afterwards horizontal, along which the vertebral artery runs in its passage into the craniimi. Through the superior notch, which almost^ forms by itself the first intervertebral foramen, the vertebral artery and vein and the first cervical nerve pass. The inferior notches present nothing remarkable, excepting that they are sufficiently deep to form by themselves the interver- tebral foramen between the first and second vertebrae. There is no spinous process: its place is supplied by a posterior tubercle (i) for muscular insertion, analogous to the anterior tubercle, or more correctly resembling a spinous process truncated. Sometimes, instead of a, tubercle, there are only some inequalities. The posterior arch (Ji, i, h), which formF, more than half the circumference of the vertebra, consists of two strong and long plates. The articular processes or columns, which we have remarked throughout tUe whole cervical region, are very large in the atlas, and bear the name of lateral masses. This structure is connected with the use of the bone, which is to support the occipital condyles, and consequently the weight of the head. Of the four articular processes the superior (6 b) are concave, slanting m- wards, oval, and obliquely directed from behind foi-wards, and from without inwards. Their form exactly corresponds with the convexity of the occipital condyles (7 7, Jig. 10.), which they receive, and for this purpose their external borders and posterior extremities are considerably elevated. Withm and below the articular surface are certain inequalities (fffig. 6.), which give attachment to the transverse ligament. The inferior articular processes are circular and plane ; they look downwards and a little inwards. The transverse processes (cc) are very large and triangular : they have on y one tubercle, into which are inserted the principal rotatory muscles of the head : they are perforated by a foramen (e) at the base, but are not grooved on their ^"^ThTcharacteristics then of the atlas are, an annular forni—great lateral dimen- sions so that it surmounts the vertebral column like a capital—a very large vertebral foramen-no body,nor spinous process-large lateral masses, supporting very strong transverse processes, which are not grooved, and have only one tubercle.

Its edges are curved, but its surfaces are flat. The curve, which it describes, forms part of the circumference of a much smaller circle than any of the other ribs. The posterior extremity has a small head with a single convex facette (a, fig. 40.), supported by a long thin and cylindrical _ neck (6). The tubercle (c) is very prominent; it occu- pies the external border, and gives an angular appearance to this rib. The anterior extremity (d) is broader than that of any other ribs. Of the two sur- faces, one is directed upwards and sUghtly outwards, the other downwards and a Uttle inwards. The superior surface {fig. 40.) has two depressions separated by a tuberosity (e). The anterior corresponds to the subclavian vein; the posterior to the artery of the same name. The tuberosity which separates them gives attachment to the anterior scalenus muscle. The mternal edge (a e d) is concave, the external (a c d) is convex and has no groove. The first rib has neither a curvature of torsion, nor an angle; so that the whole of it can rest upon the same horizontal plane. The superior surface presents also near its anterior extremity a depression which appears to result from pressure by the clavicle, which I have seen, in some cases, immediately articulated with this bone. The second rib (2, fig. 38.) preserves many of the characters of the preceding, but differs essentially in its length, which is at least double; it belongs to a much larger circle : it has no curvature of torsion, and can rest upon the same plane with its two ends ; the angle is scarcely visible. The external surface is directed upwards ; it presents in the middle a very rough eminence for the attachment of the serratus magnus muscle. The internal surface looks ob- liquely downwards ; near the tubercle it has a very small groove. The third rib {S, fig. 38.) differs from the second by its great length, by the presence of the angle, and by a curvature of torsion sufficient to prevent the two ends from resting at once upon the same horizontal plane. The eleventh and twelfth ribs (U 12, fig. 38.) differ from all the others by the following characters: 1. they form segments of much larger circles than any of the others; 2. their heads have only one articular facette, and this is flattened ; 3. they have no neck, properly so called ; 4. they have no tubercle ; 5. they have no groove ; 6. they have a very thin and pointed anterior ex- tremity. These two ribs differ from each other only, in length, the twelfth being the shorter.

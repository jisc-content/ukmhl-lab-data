Phan/nqeal mucous membrane. The muscular semi-canal of the pharynx is Unedbv a mucous membrane continuous with the buccal and nasal mucous membranes on the one hand, and with those of the larynx and oesophagus on the other This membrane, which is of a reddish colour, presents some pe- cuUarities at different parts of its extent. Above, near the basilar process, it is thick, and as it were fungous, and closely united to the periosteum, from which indeed it cannot be separated ; in this region it is very Uable to become the seat of fibrous polypi. Near the posterior orifices of the nasal fossae and the openings of the Eustachian tubes, it is, in some respects, similar to the pituitary membrane.* It forms a sort of rim around the trumpet-shaped orifice of the Eustachian tube, into which it is prolonged in a remarkable manner, gradually becoming thinner, and at length continuous with the hnmg membrane of the cavity of the tympanum. This continuity of the mucous membrane of the pharynx and Eustachian tube explains the close sympathy between these parts, and also the deafness which so frequently follows chronic sore-throats and coryzse, in consequence of the obstruction of these tubes. In its buccal portion it exactly resembles the mucous membrane, upon the the lower surface of the velum palati: the part covering the posterior surface of the larynx is pale, and forms several folds. The mucous membrane of the pharynx adheres to the subjacent muscles, only through the medium of very loose cellular tissue, which is never loaded with fat, nor infiltrated with serosity. It is still less intimately adherent to the posterior surface of the larynx. Its surface is raised by a great number of small glands, chiefly occupying the upper part of the pharynx near the posterior nares : we shall divide them into agglomerated and solitary. Two agglomerated glands are always situated around the orifices of the Eustachian tube ; they open upon the mucous mem- brane, either separately or together. These glands are sometimes arranged in a line, sometimes in several parallel rows. Haller believes that the salpicgo- pharyngeus of Santorini and Winslow is nothing more than a series of these glands united together by fibrous tissue. The solitary glands are scattered over the whole extent of the pharynx. Lastly, the pharyngeal mucous mem- brane is provided with a thin epithelium f, which can be easily demonstrated by maceration and the action of acids. » See note, infrd. t [According to Dr. Henle, the upper part of the mucous membrane of the pharynx is co- vered with a ciliated columnar epithelium, as far down as a horizontal line extending from the lower border of the atlas to the floor of tiic nasal fossaj; below that line the epithelium assumes

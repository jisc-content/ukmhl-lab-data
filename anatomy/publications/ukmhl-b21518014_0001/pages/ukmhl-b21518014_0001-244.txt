222 ARTHROLOGY. more particularly at the second metatarsal bone, because the third cuneiform bone projects, and is wedged in between the second and fourth metatarsal bones, while the second metatarsal bone projects into the tarsus between the first and the third cuneiform bones. The articular surfaces are held together by dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments. We shall now study each of these articulations separately. Articulation of the first metatarsal bone with the tarsus. There are two semi- lunar facettes in this articulation, one belonging to the first metatarsal, the other to the first cuneiform bone; the long diameter of these surfaces is directed vertically. The strength of the joint is maintained by a very strong plantar if, figs. 82 and 84.), and a thinner dorsal {p,fig. 83. and e,fig. 84.) ligament. Both these consist of bands directed from before backwards. There is a dis- tinct synovial membrane for this joint. We may include among the ligaments of this articulation the aponeurotic expansion giren off by the peroneus longus to the first cuneiform bone, and also that derived from the tibialis anticus, and attached to the first metatarsal bone. The articulation of the second metatarsal bone with the tarsus is effected by the reception of the posterior extremity of that bone within the recess formed by the three cuneiform bones. We met with a similar arrangement, though less perfectly developed, in the carpo-metacarpal articulation of the second meta- carpal bone. It is the strongest of aU the joints of this kind, and is provided with, 1. three dorsal ligaments, as in the corresponding articulation in the hand; one median lr,fig. 83.), broad and constantly divided into two bands, which proceed from the second cuneiform bone; a very strong internal ligament, extending from the first cuneiform bone, the third being external, thm, and at- tached to the third cuneifoi-m bone; 2. with two plantar ligaments, one of which (a fiq 82 ) is very strong, extends obliquely from the first cuneiform to the second metatarsal bone, and is prolonged upwards so as to become mterosseous; the other is very small, and proceeds from the sharp edge of the second cunei- form to the second metatarsal bone ; 3. with an interosseous or lateral ligament, extending from the external lateral surface of the first cuneiform bone to the internal lateral surface of the second metatarsal bone. The articulation of the third metatarsal bone with the tarsus is maintained by a dorsal ligament (s, fig. 83.) from the third cuneiform bone Jh^ef i. no pk^ta^^ ligament, properly so called, unless an obhque bundle of fibres from the first cSorm bonebe^considered as such; but the ^^'^^^^^^y'Y^f.fZ'Z'i ing the sheath of the tendon of the peroneus longus, is P^-f^^ff^^^^to the third metatarsal bone, appears to me to act as a plantar ligament. There is also an T^^nal lateral or interosseous ligament, which separates the articulations of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. ThTfourth and fifth metatarsal bones together present a slightly concave surface which artif^ates with the convex surface of the cuboid. The means of u^on^onsist of a dorsal ligament {t,fig. 83.) for the fourth, and an oblique UaZentiT^nmng outwards and forwards, for the fifth metatarsal bone: they ftjramenJ W, run g ^^^^^ ijg^ment, ex- are both loose, but especially tne ^^^^y ceptmg the ^^^aA oyhe tendo^ oi t p ^^e peroneus brevis tendmous expans^^oa o^^^^^^^^ I'esides this tendon, there exists a acts as an «tei°al iate^^^^^^^^^ very strong fibrous ^'^^'.f^"^ nrocess of the fifth metatarsal bone; and, extends from the os caleis ° ^^P^^^-^^^^^ °* ' lo.gus, given off as it moreover, an expansion % ^he tendon ^^^^^ F nietafarsal bone is very passes over the cuboid J^e ^^^m^ , ^t.^tched ft-om the external loose.

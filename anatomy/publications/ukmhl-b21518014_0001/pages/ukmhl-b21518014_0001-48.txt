2G OSTEOLOGY. who first observed this anomaly, considers it to be a predisposing cause of apoplexy, on account of the accompanying shortness of the neck, and con- sequent approximation of the heart and brain. There are sometimes thirteen dorsal vertebraj: sometimes the fifth lumbar is united to the first sacral, and there are then only four lumbar vertebrse. In other cases, the first sacral ver- tebra is distinct from the rest, and the lumbar portion of the column then consists of six. • , , The vertebra; present general characters, which distmguish them from all other bones: they have also characters peculiar to each particular region ; and in each group or region certain vertebrae have individual distinctive cha- racters. Fig. 3. General Characters of the Vertebrae. Every vertebra (Jigs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.) is essentiaUy a symmetrical ring, a Fig 2. segment of the cylinder which protects the spinal 7 '■ ^Si^Y' marrow, and is consequently peiforated by a fora- J*^'^%:^s^sM ''(^yS^ denominated the vertebral or nichidian fura- ^ -(<nStaS^^»<TKa men i\,fig- 2.). As it concurs also to form part of a supporting column, it presents a kind of enlarge- ment or solid cylinder, of which the posterior fifth has been removed. This enlargement is the boihj of the vertebra (2). Each vertebra gives attach- ment to numerous muscles, by very marked emi- nences for insertion-the spinous (3) and transverse processes (ij). Itis articu- lated with the other vertebra by four articular processes (5 5), two superwr and two inferior. Lastly, it presents two superwr and two i»/er,or notches (7, figs. 4,1), which unite to form the intervertebral foramina, through which the vessels and nerves are transmitted. , ,„v • *t. xne ves>hei!. a ^ ^^^^ ^j^^ vertebra (2) occupies the anterior portion of the vertebral ring, and presents four surfaces.

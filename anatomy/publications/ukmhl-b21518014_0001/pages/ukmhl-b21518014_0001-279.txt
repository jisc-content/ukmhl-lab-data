257 THE TERES MAJOR. rior layer of the aponeurosis of the transversus abdominis. This aponeurosis assists in forming the sheath of the sacro-lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, and trans- verso-spinalis. The costal origins consist of fleshy tongues or digitations, which ai-e interposed between similar processes of the external oblique. From this threefold origin the fleshy fibres proceed in the following manner: the upper pass horizontally, the middle are directed obliquely, and the lower ver- tically upwards ; they all converge, so as to form a thick fasciculus, directed towards the inferior angle of the scapula, from which it often receives some accessory fibres. The muscle is then twisted upon itself, so that the inferior or vertical fibres become first anterior and then superior, while the superior or horizontal fibres become first posterior, and then inferior. This torsion may perhaps be intended to prevent displacement of the fibres. They all terminate iu a flat quadrilateral tendon, which is inserted into the bottom of the bicipital groove, above the insertion of the tendon of the pectoralis major. This tendon furnishes a fibrous expansion continuous with the fascia of the arm, and also a band which extends to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus. Relations. This muscle is covered by the skin (from which it is separated by a closely adherent fibro-celliilar sheath), and by the inferior angle of the trapezms. It covers the posterior spinal muscles, the serratus posticus infe- rior, the external mtercostals, the serratus magnus, the lower angle of the sca- pula, the rhomboideus, and lastly the teres major, by which muscle it is itself covered m its turn. Its external margm is in relation with the posterior border of the external oblique, from which it is separated below by a smaU triangular mterval. The upper part of the external margin, together with the teres major, forms the posterior border of the axiUa; and from the same mar- gin a muscular fasciculus occasionally extends beneath the axilla to the lower edge of the pectorahs major.

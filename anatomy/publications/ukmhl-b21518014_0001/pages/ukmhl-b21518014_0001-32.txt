Thus, it is certain that the specific, as well as the absolute weight of bones, is much less considerable la the old person than in the adult: and this difference depends upon the loss of substance -which the bones undergo, in common with aU other tissues, during the progress of age: thus, in aged subjects, the walls of the cy- linder of the long bones are remarkably diminished in thickness, while the medullary cavity is proportionaUy increased. We may even affirm with Chaussier, that the medullary cavity of the shaft of long bones has a greater diameter, in proportion as the individual is advanced in age. In like manner the ceUs of the spongy tissue become much larger, and their waUs ac- quire an extreme tenuity. It may nevertheless be contended, that the weight of the osseous fibre, or rather of the osseous molecules of the old people, is greater comparatively than that of the same parts in the adult: and this pre- sumption is abnost converted into certainty by chemical analysis, which shows an excess of phosphate of Ume in the bones of the aged: to remove all doubts upon this point, it would be necessary to grind an adult bone and an old one, and to weigh in the balance an equal bulk of each powder. In this way the contradictory statements of certain authors might be reconciled. The increasino- fragility of bones and the consequent frequency of fractures in old ao-e is easily explained, since along with the accumulation of phosphate of Ume which diminishes the elasticity while it increases the brittleness, there occurs a diminution of bulk, and consequently there is less resistance. It is with respect to the quantity of calcareous phosphate alone, that the osseous system can be said to preponderate in old age. . , , , • „:+i,„.

449 THE PAROTID GLAND The Salivary Glands. ^hich by most anatomists ^l^J^^J^^^^ ^^^^^ypartic glandular apparatus, parous crypts, there exists svmmScllly exteiided\long the rami and forming a sort of cham ^^^^^tn upted so as to form six glandular ^iLftt^o^SVn'reS^ and sub-lingual glands.* The Parotid Gland. The parotid gland {p,fig. 144.), so called from being situated below and in ine paroua giaau jy ^^^^^ ^^^^^ external auditory meatus Qrrapa, near, ods, iiros, the ear), fills the parotid ex- cavation. It is bounded in front by the 144. pogtgrioj. edge of the ramus of the lower ^ jaw ; behind, by the external auditory me- atus and the mastoid process; above, by the zygomatic arch; below, by the angle of the lower jaw ; and on the inside, by the styloid process and the muscles which pro- ceed from it. This gland has given its name to the region occupied by it. It is the largest of all the salivary glands, and even exceeds all the rest put together. Its foi-m is irregular, and is determined by that of the surrounding parts, upon which it is moulded like a piece of soft wax. Its superficial portion is broad, but it suddenly becomes contracted when it dips behind the ramus of the jaw. In order to obtain a good idea of the size and shape of this gland, it must be removed entire from the irregular mould in which it is lodged. It has been compared to a pyramid, of which the base is directed outwards, and the apex inwards. Relations. Its external surface, or base, is broad, oblong from above down- wards, irregularly quadrilateral, and lobulated at the edges; it is subcuta.neous, being separated from the skin, however, by the parotid fascia and the risorius of Santorini, when that muscle exists, f Its anterior surface is grooved so as to embrace the posterior edge of the ramus of the lower jaw. A bursa, or some loose cellular tissue facilitates the movements of these parts. This surface is also in relation with the internal pterygoid muscle, the stylo-maxillary ligament, and the masseter muscle, on the external surface of which it is prolonged to a greater or less extent (see fg. 144.) in diflferent individuals, and is separated from it anteriorly by the ramifications of the facial nerve, by some loose cellular tissue, and by the transverse artery of the face. Its posterior surface is in relation with the cartilaginous portion of the ex- ternal auditory canal, being moulded upon its convexity, and. adhering to it by very dense cellular tissue: it corresponds also to the mastoid process, the stemo-cleido-mastoid and digastric muscles, and indirectly to the transverse process of the atlas. This surface is extremely irregular, adheres by means * The continuity of this glandular chain, admitted by some anatomists, is only apparent. A fibrous septum always intervenes between the sub-maxillary and the parotid glands. t In a female in whom I dissected the parotid gland, the risorius arose from the superior semicircular line of the occipital bono by two distinct fasciculi, which, passing downwardsand forwards, united opposite the apex of the mastoid process, and then proceeding horizontally, expanded upon the parotid gland. Some of the fibres reached the commissure of the lips, but the greater number were lost upon the parotid fascia. VOL. I. G G

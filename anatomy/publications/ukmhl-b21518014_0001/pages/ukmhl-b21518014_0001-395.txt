THE FLEXOR LONGUS POLLICIS. 373 The Flexor Longus Digitorum Pedis. This is a penniform, elongated, and reflected muscle (o, figs. 130.132.), situ- ated along the posterior surface of the tibia and in the sole of the foot; it is the most internal muscle of the deep layer, is flattened from before backwards, and terminates below in four tendons. Attachments. It arises from the tibia, and is inserted into the last phalanges of the last four toes. It arises from the oblique line of the tibia, below the po- pliteus and the soleus, and from the middle three fifths of the posterior surface of the same bone. Some fibres also proceed from the tendinous septum inter- vening between it and the tibialis posticus. From these different origins the fleshy fibres proceed obliquely backwards and downwards to the anterior sur- face and edges of a tendon, which commences near the upper end of the muscle, and gradually disengages itself from the fleshy fibres, being accompanied by them anteriorly as far as the internal malleolus. It passes behind this projection in the same sheath as the tendon of the tibialis posticus, from which it is se- parated by a fibrous septum; it soon leaves that tendon, passing to its outer or fibular side (o, fig. 129.), and is then reflected at an obtuse angle upon the internal malleolus. It now becomes horizontal, and is buried under the astra- galus and the small anterior tubercle of the os calcis, where it is contained in a proper sheath. Having thus reached the sole of the foot (o, figs. 131,132.) it pa.sses obliquely outwards and forwards, crosses under the tendon of the flexor longus poUicis at a very acute angle, receives from it a strong tendinous com- munication, and at the same time becoming expanded is joined by its accessory muscle, and finally divides into four tendons for the last four toes. The tendon for the second toe proceeds directly forwards. The tendons for the other toes in succession pass more and more obliquely. Having reached the metatarso- phalangal articulations these tendons are received, together with those of the flexor brevis digitorum, into the sheaths upon the first and second phalanges • and they have precisely the same relations to the tendons of the last mentioned muscle, as the flexor profundus is observed to have with regard to the flexor subhmis digitorum in the hand; and hence the name of perforans given by Spigebus to the long flexor of the toes. The tendons are finally inserted into the posterior extremities of the third phalanges.

This is the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, continuous with the base of the crista gaUi, quadnlateral, often deflected to one side, and forms part of the septum narium (1, 2, 3, 4,^sr. 22.) : in front, it articulates with the nasal spine of'the frontal bone, and with the proper bones of the nose; behind with the anterior crest of the sphenoid; and below, with the vomer, and the cartilage of the septum. The anterior border of the cribriform plate articulates with the frontal. _ The pos- terior is usually notched for the reception of the spine, or pro- cess ( f. Jigs 13 aiid 14.), which surmounts the median ridge of the sphenoid. The lateral masses are cuboid in figure, and formed of large irregular cells, which together are named the labyrinth. They have six surfaces : in the supe- rior surface we observe several imperfect ceUs {d d,fig. 15.), which in the united state are completed and, as it were, roofed in by those we have already described as existing on each side of the ethmoidal notch of the frontal. We find also two or three grooves, which join with similar grooves in the frontal bone, and form the internal orbitary canals. On the inferior surface we perceive thin ir- regularly twisted laminae, which narrow the opening of the maxillary sinuses. The most considerable of these has received the name of unciform or great process of the ethmoid : it is a curved plate which arises from the inferior surface of the transverse septa, which close the anterior ethmoidal cells, and is placed between the anterior extremity of the middle turbinated bone, and the OS planum or lamina papyracea, to be aftei-wards described; it sometimes arti- culates with the inferior turbinated bone. The anterior surface presents half cells, which are covered by the os unguis and the ascending process of the max- illary bone. On the posterior surface we see the posterior extremities of the superior and middle turbinated bones, and of the superior and middle meatus, and a convex uneven surface -which corresponds with the posterior eth- moidal cells. This surface articulates with the sphenoid above, and with the palate bone below. The external surface is formed by a smooth quadri- lateral plate i_e,fig. 15.) placed vertically and very thin, to which the ancients gave the name of lamina papyracea or os planum. It has an elongated rectan- gular form, is slightly curved upon itself, and constitutes a great part of the in- ternal waU of the orbit. The superior border articulates with the frontal, and assists in forming the orifice of the internal orbital canals; the inferior articu- lates -with the maxillary and palate bones, the anterior with the os unguis, and the posterior with the sphenoid and palate bones. The internal surface constitutes the greatest part of the external wall of the nasal fossaj: on it we observe, in front, a rough quadrilateral surface marked • Morgagni mentions the case of an asthmatic subject, in whom the crista galli was so ob- liquely placed that the ethmoidal groove on one side was very much contracted, and consider- ably enlarged on the other. There was a much greater number of foramina on one side than 08 the other. £ 3

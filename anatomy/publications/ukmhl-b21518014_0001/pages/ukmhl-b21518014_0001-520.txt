498 SPLANCHNOLOGY. to the rectum, or to the displaced sigmoid flexure. There can be no doubt that this double curve of the colon is connected with its uses as a receptacle for fajcal matters. The size of the sigmoid flexure varies considerably. In a case of imper- forate anus in an infant, which lived twenty days, it became enormously dis- tended. Retention of the faeces in the addt seldom causes so proportionally great an accumulation in the sigmoid flexure; the rectum is almost entirely the seat of the accumulation. Relations. The sigmoid flexure corresponds to the abdominal parietes in front. When empty, its relations with the latter are indirect, in consequence of the interposition of some convolutions of the small intestine; when it is distended, they are immediate; and hence we are recommended to make an artificial anus in the sigmoid flexure of the colon, in cases where the rectum is imperforate. It is in contact behind with the iliac fossa, to which it is fixed by the mesocolon: hence it can be easily compressed and explored by the fingers, for the purpose of detecting hardened masses of faeces. In the rest of its circumference it is in relation with the convolutions of the small intestine. The internal surface of the colon. On the internal surface of the colon are seen three longitudinal ridges, corresponding to the three muscular bands on its external surface ; three intermediate rows of sacculi, the concavities of which agree exactly with the protuberances on the external surface; and lastly, nu- merous ridges or incomplete septa, dividing the cells of each row from one another, and improperly called valves; they correspond to the grooves or de- pressions on the external surface. In order to comprehend the arrangement of the cells and the intervening septa, we must examine the large intestme, when moderately distended and dried. If the muscular bands have been previously divided, the cells and septa disappear. The internal saccuU, as well as the external protuberances, vary much m dif- ferent individuals, and even in different parts of the same colon. Thus, there are eeneraUy only two rows in the descending colon and the sigmoid flexure, because there are only two muscular bands in those parts. Sometimes, indeed, there are no cells in the sigmoid flexure. Lastly, the internal surface of the large intestine presents some irregular folds, which are completely effaced by ^''Sr°cJ«m. The rectum (7i i, fig. 139.), so called from its direction, which is generally less flexuous than that of the rest of the intestinal canal, is the last portion of the large intestine, and consequently of the digestive tube. It commences at the base of the sacinim, and termmates at the anus. It is situated in the true pelvis in front of the sacrum and coccyx (r,fig. Ul.; oo fig. 181.). We see then that the alimentary canal, after having abandoned the vertebral column in order to describe its numerous convolutions, is situated at its ter- mination in front of the lower part of that column, just as at its commencement, h i^ applied to the upper part of the same. It is firmly fixed especiaUy below, iw?ft is sSrounded on all sides by cellular tissue, and is also bound down by The super or JSvic fascia. This part of it cannot, therefore, suffer such displace- ments as occur in hernia; bat from its functions as an organ of expulsion the who e effort of the abdominal muscles is concentrated upon it, and it ,s, there- ^^e Sle to displacements of a different kind, viz. to invagination and eversion.

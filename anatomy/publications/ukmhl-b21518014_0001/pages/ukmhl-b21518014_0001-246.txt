It is grooved below for the flexor tendons, concave above to correspond with the convexity of the head of the metatarsal bone, and completes the cavity in which that head is received. Its anterior edge is very firmly fixed to the plantar border of the cavity of the phalanx, of which it seems a continuation ; its posterior edge is free, or rather is loosely connected by some ligamentous fibres to the ine- qualities behind the head of the metatarsal bone, upon the contracted neck of which it is moulded very exactly, so that, while protecting the lower part of the joint, it serves also to increase the extent of the surfaces included in the articulation. 2. There are two very strong lateral ligaments {ij,figs. 82 and 83.), an internal and an external, inserted not into the depressions on each side of the head of the metatarsal bone, but into tubercles situated behind them ; from this origin they proceed very obliquely forwards and downwards, like flat bands, spreading out as they advance, and terminating partly in the inferior ligament, and partly on the sides of the phalanx. There is no dorsal hgament, properly so called, but the corresponding extensor tendon evidently occupies its place. It is not uncommon to observe a prolongation from the anterior sur- face of this tendon united to the metatarsal end of the first phalanx. Synovial capsule. Under the extensor tendon we find a very loose synovial capsule; it covers the internal surface of the ligaments as well as the articular '^^'riieZetatarso-phalangal articulation of the first metatarsal bone presents some peculiarities which merit special description. 1. The articular surfaces are much larger than in the other sunilar joints. 2. The head of the first me- tatarsal bone presents two puUies on its plantar aspect, separated from each other by a prominent ridge directed from before backwards. This construction is connected with the presence of two sesamoid bones (g,Jig. 84.), developed in the substance of the inferior ligament, which is three or four tmies hicker than in the other joints. The lateral Ugaments are ahnost exclusively fixed into these sesamoid bones. This joint has also a sort of fibrous nng surmountmg the border of the glenoid cavity of the phalanx.

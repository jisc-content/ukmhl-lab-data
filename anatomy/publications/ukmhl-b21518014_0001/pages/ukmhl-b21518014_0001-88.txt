66 OSTEOLOGY. Development of the Cranium. Tlie cranium is remarkable for the early period at which its development commences. As soon as the embryo is sufficiently advanced in growth to ex- hibit any distinction of parts, the head, under the form of an ovoid vesicle, greatly exceeds the magnitude of the whole body. With regard to the order in which the different parts are ossified, we may remark, that the bones of the roof precede those of the base, in like manner as in the vertebras the lamina are ossified before the bodies. In both cases the evolution is most prompt m those parts which are especially destined to protect important organs. Cranial Banes at Birth. The bones of the roof of the skull appear before those of the base, but at birth ossification is less advanced in the roof than in the base ; accordingly, in a foetus at the full time the bones of the base form a solid whole, and are mimovable, while those of the roof are separated by membranous intervals, which permit of pretty extensive movements, so that at this period the roof of the cranmm yields in a great degree to pressure. At birth, there is nothing resemblmg the mode of union called suture. Nevertheless each bone presents denticula- tions like the teeth of a comb round the circumference. The existence of these indentations before the period when the bones come mto contact, proves that they are not the result of any mechanical action produced by their meeting- the only influence of this kind to which they are subjected durmg their formation, is the deviation of opposing denticulations. The frontal suture is the first developed. . • ^ t Another pecuUarity of this stage of development, is the existence of those membranous intervals denominated fontanelles. They are produced in the following manner : the process of ossification commences m the centre of the bone, and advances from that point to the circumference, the most distant parts of the bone being of course the last to be ossified. These points, m broad or fiat bones, are th! angles, and consequently at the place where several angl of different bones ultimately unite, there must exist an unossified space at h^ time • these spaces are the fontanelles. They have all been pointed out lu S de cription of the cranial bones: they are of especial importance to the accoucheur on account of the indications which they furnish for determining the posS of the child. AU traces of the fontaneUes are completely obhte- rated at the age of four years. The Wormian Bones. The Wormian bones should be regarded as supplementary points or centres developed v^en the general ossification proceeds somewhat slowly; and we fherere consider it proper, to include a description of them m the account of %t wSian ?oner~d because the first description of them has been assTie'to mrmius, a physician in Copenhagen are a^so ^^^^^-fl^^P^^ bonSossa triguetra, or --P'^rLdTze tut tfy arl mLt co— i^ variable both ^-^^^^f^X^e Zo^t^^^^^^^ the asperities the lambdoid suture, i. e.

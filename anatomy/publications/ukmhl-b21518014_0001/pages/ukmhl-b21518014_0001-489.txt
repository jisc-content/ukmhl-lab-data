THE STOMACH. 467 n H 2 Direction. The stomach is directed obliquely downwards to the right side, and a little forwards; this direction affords some explanation of the almost constant habit of lying on the right side during sleep, and why the rest is dis- turbed, and digestion rendered difficult in those who lie upon the left side. Changes in direction of the stomach depend upon the same causes as changes in its situation. Thus, dragging produced by displacement of the small intestine or the omentum, enlargements of the liver or spleen, or the use of too tight stays *, must necessarily affect the direction of this organ. We not unfrequently find stomachs having a vertical direction. Number. The stomach is single in the human subject as well as in the greater number of animals. The examples of double or triple stomachs in the human subject are merely cases of single stomachs having one or more circular constrictions.f The essential character of a double stomach is not an accidental or even a congenital contraction, but a difference in structure. Bilocular stomachs, indeed, are very common ; but this form (resembUng that of some kinds of calabash-gourds), though sometimes extremely well marked when the stomach is empty, disappears almost entirely when it is much dis- tended by inflation. Size. In all animals, the stomach is the most capacious part of the ali- mentary canal; so that in many species, where its limits are not so clearly de- fined as in man, the existence of a stomach is determined only by the presence of a dilatation. It is of considerable size in herbivora, but comparatively much smaller in carnivora. The himian stomach is intermediate between these extremes — a fact which affords evidence of its adaptation to both vege- table and aliment diet. The himaan stomach, however, presents innumerable varieties in size, from a state of extreme contraction in which it scarcely ex- ceeds the duodenum, to such an enormous degree of dilatation that it occupies a third, a half, or even almost the whole, of the abdominal cavity. These differences depend less upon original variations, than upon its peculiarly dilatable and elastic structure, which enables it to contain a large quantity of food, and to contract more or less completely upon itself when empty. Thus the stomach has a much greater capacity in those who adopt the bad habit of eating only one very full meal in the twenty-four houi-s, than in those who eat more frequently but less abundantly. In some cases of stricture at the py- loi-us, it becomes enormously distended. Long continued abstinence occasions such an amount of contraction, that it has even been asserted, that pain re- sulting from the rubbing of its parietes together gives rise to the feeling of hunger; but this completely mechanical hypothesis should be rejected. In a great number of cholera patients the stomach was found to be exceedingly small. In a female, who died a month after having volimtarily swallowed a small quantity of sulphuric acid, the contracted stomach was not larger than a moderately sized gaU-bladder. Figure. The stomach resembles a flattened cone, curved upon itself back- wards and upwards, and having a rounded base ; it has been compared to the bladder of a bagpipe. Sections made at right angles to its axis represent circles gradually decreasing in size from the entrance of the oesophagus to the pylorus. We have to examine its external and its internal surface.

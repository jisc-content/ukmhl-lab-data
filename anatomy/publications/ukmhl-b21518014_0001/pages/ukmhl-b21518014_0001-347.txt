THE PALMARIS LONG US. 325 Y 3 more completely rolled around the radius. I may remark, that on account of its obliquity it is inserted into the radius at an angle of 45°; and that, conse- quently, the direction in -which it operates is rather favourable. It acts with greater advantage in proportion as it is inserted nearer to the upper end of the radius; and, for tliis reason, its power must vary considerably in dif- ferent individuals. When pronation is carried as far as possible, the muscle then becomes a flexor of the fore-arm. After the preceding examination of this muscle, we need no longer be surprised at the great energy of the move- ment of pronation, which is much more powerful than that of supination ; nor yet that it is the most natural position of the fore-arm, for the pronator teres can more than counteract the two supinators taken together. In fracture of the bones of the fore-arm, this muscle tends to obliterate the interosseous space. The Flexor Carpi Radialis. Dissection. It is sufficient to divide and dissect off the anterior part of the fascia of the fore-arm, in order to expose this muscle, which may be recog- nised by the following description : — The flexor carpi radialis (radialis internus, Albinus, b, fig. 118.) is situated immediately within the pronator teres, occupying the superficial layer of the anterior aspect of the fore-arm, and being, as far as its tendon is concerned, the most superficial of all these muscles. It arises from the lower part of the internal border and from the inner condyle of the humerus {b,fig. 119.), and is inserted (6') into the second metacarpal bone. Its origin consists of a tendon common to it and to the pronator quadratus, palmaris longus, flexor sublimis, • and flexor carpi ulnaris. The fleshy fibres immediately arise from within a sort of pyramidal aponeurosis given off by this common tendon, and from the body of the muscle, at first slender, then increasing in size, and again tapering towards its attachment to the two surfaces and edges of a tendon, which forms the lower two thirds of the muscle, and passes obliquely outwards and down- wards to the level of the OS scaphoides; it there penetrates into a groove formed by the scaphoid and the trapezium, is reflected inwards along this oblique groove, and terminates upon the second metacarpal bone, spreading out so as to embrace its upper extremity; it also gives off a tendinous ex- pansion to the trapezium, and sometimes one to the third metacarpal bone. Relations. It is covered by the fascia and the skin, through which it is very clearly defined: it is m relation behind with the flexor subUmis; on the out- side with the tendon of the flexor poUicis, over which it passes at an acute angle so as to bmd it down ; and lower down with the wrist joint.

28 OSTEOLOGY. The second distinctive character is the proportion of the diameters. In all vertebraj the transverse diameter is the greatest, and the vertical the smallest. In the lumbar vertebrae the height or vertical diameter is twelve Unes (one inch), in the dorsal nine lines (three quarters of an inch), and in the cervical six lines (half an inch). In the cervical and lumbar regions, the vertical diameter of the body is less behind than before, which inequality gives rise to the anterior con- vexity of these regions. In the dorsal region, on the other hand, the vertical dia- meter is shortest anteriorly. In the lumbar region, the transverse diameter does not exceed the vertical and the antero-posterior by more than one third at most. In the dorsal region no one diameter is strikingly predominant; but in the cervical the transverse is almost double that of the antero-posterior and the vcrtiCcil di£iiiiGt6rs. The third distinctive character is formed by the lateral ridges of the bodies of the cervical vertebra. From the two sides of the superior surface of the bodies of the cervical vertebraj, arise two small ridges (Jig. 2. on each side of 2), which are received into corresponding depressions on the inferior surface of the vertebra above. This mutual fitting-in of the bodies of the cervical vertebrae compensates for the less secure connexion of their articular processes. The fourth distinctive character consists in the two demi-facettes on each side of the bodies of the dorsal vertebra (6 &,f g. 4.). These demi-facettes when united with the corresponding parts of the neighbouring vertebrae form an- gular excavations, in which the posterior extremities of the ribs are received. This character belongs exclusively to the dorsal vertebrae. The fifth distinctive character is the excavation of the superior and inferior surfaces of the bodies, which is less in the dorsal region than in the cervical or lumbar. From this disposition it results, that a lenticular space of a much greater size intervenes between every two of the lumbar and cervical Ver- tebra; than between the dorsal: the mobility is consequently much mcreased, from the greater size of the intervertebral substance. . , .-^^ The specific characters, then, of the bodies of the vertebra; in the different regions are the foUowing: —1. Lateral ridges on the superior surface of the cer- vical vertebra. 2. Lateral faccttes on the dorsal vertebra. 3 The absence oj these two characters, and the preponderance of size in the lumbar vertebra It the body of a vertebra be presented for our inspection, we can at once deter- mine from these characters the region to which it belongs. The Vertebral Foramen and the Notches in the different Regions of the Spine. The vertebral foramen and the notches present certain marked distinctions in the vertebrae of the three regions, by which they may be recognised by a practUed eye transverse diameter of the foramen (l,y?sr. 2.) condderably exceeds the antero-posterior. 2.

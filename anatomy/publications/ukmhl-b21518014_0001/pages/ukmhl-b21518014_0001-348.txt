MYOLOGY. 326 muscle (le petit palmaire) has also been called le grand palmaire {Bichat). It is a small, fusiform, slender, fleshy bundle (c. Jig. 118.), of about four inches in length, arising {c,fig 119.) from the inner condyle of the humerus to the inner side of the preceding muscle, and from a small tendinous cone, which isolates it from that muscle, the flexor sublimis, and the flexor carpi ulnaris. The fleshy fibres terminate around a flat tendon, which constitutes the lower two thirds of the muscle (whence the name palmaris longus), proceeds vertically downwards and a little outwards, and terminates by expanding in front of the anterior annular ligament {g, figs. 118, 119.) of the wrist, and becommg contmuous with the middle palmar fascia (c'j^jr. 118.). _ . This muscle is subject to a great many varieties, and is often wanting; its fleshy belly is sometimes very long, and occasionally occupies the middle of the muscle. . , , ^ ■ j- ?• \ Relations. The same as those of the preceding muscle (Jlexor carpi radialis); its tendon is very superficial. It is separated from the neighbouring muscles by a very strong sheath. . ^ , v Action It is a tensor of the palmar fascia. When this effect has been pro- duced, it flexes the hand upon the fore-arm. According to Winslow, it would assist the flexor carpi radialis in pronation. The Flexor Carpi Ulnaris. Dissection.

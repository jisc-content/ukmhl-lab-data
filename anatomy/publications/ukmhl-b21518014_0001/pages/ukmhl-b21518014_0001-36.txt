14 OSTEOLOGY. cause it is deep and round, like a vessel known by the ancients under the name of KoriAij. 2. The name glenoid (from 7A.iifr;) is applied to many articular cavities, which are more shallow; for example, the glenoid cavity of the sca- pula, the glenoid cavity of the temporal "bone. 3. The term alveoli has been assigned to the cells or sockets in which the roots of the teeth are lodged. It is not correct, however, to consider as an articulation the union of the teeth with the jaws, because, as we shall afterwards show, the teeth are not true boaes. The non-articular cavities are to be considered with reference both to their figure, and their uses. From their figure they have received the following deno- minations: 1. FosscE, or pits, are cavities largely excavated, wider at the margin than at the bottom; ex. the parietal fossoe. 2. Sinuses are cavities with a narrow entrance; as the sphenoidal sinus, maxillary sinus, &c. 3. The term cells is applied when the cavities are smaUbut numerous, and communicating with each other as the ethmoidal cells, &c. 4. Channels (gutters) are cavities which resemble an open semi-cylindrical canal; as the channels for the longitudinal and lateral sinuses of the skull. 5. These take the name of grooves Ccoulisses) when they are Uned by a thin layer of cartilage, for the passage ot tendons ; as the bicipital groove of the humerus. The term pulley or trochlea is applied to grooves, which have their two borders also covered with cartUage. 6. bur- rows are superficial impressions, long but very narrow, and intended for the lodgment of vessels or nerves, as the furrows for the middle menmgeal artery. 7 When more deeply excavated than the last, and angular at the bottoni, they are named by the French anatomists Rainures. 8. A notch (incisura) is a cavity cut in the edge of a bone.* ' ^ . The cavities which we have described exist only on one surface of a bone; those which perforate its substance are usuaUy denominated foramina or holes. 1 AVhen a foramen has an irregular, and, as it were, lacerated oriface, it is named ?i foramen laceram. 2. When its orifice is very small and irregular it is called hiatus ; when the opening is long, narrow, and resembhng a crack or slit it s denominated a fissure ;\s the sphenoidal fissure the glenoid fissure &c 3 If the perforation runs some way through the substance of a bone it ;<! railed a conduit or canal, as the Vidian canal, carotid canal, &c.

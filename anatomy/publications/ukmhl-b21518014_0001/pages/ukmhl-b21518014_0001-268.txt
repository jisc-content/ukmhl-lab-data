246 MYOLOGY. strength of the parietes which they assist in forming. This is partictdarly ■well shiwn in the broad muscles of the abdomen. The short muscks are generally met with in the same situations as the short bones. It is not the shortness of its fibres, but of its fleshy body that charac- terises a short muscle. It is important to notice, with regard to these muscles, that a number of them are often arranged in succession so as to resemble a, long muscle. Of this we shall find many examples in the muscles of the ver- tebral grooves. Direction of the Muscles. The direction, of the muscles is one of the most important points in their history, since, without a knowledge of this, it is impossible to appreciate their xises. 'Each muscle has an axis or middle line, in which the general action of its fibres takes effect. Few muscles are altogether rectilinear; most are an- gular or curved; and almost all undergo certain deviations or reflections, in passing round the joints: some indeed take a direction, at right angles to their primitive course, when they pass over pulleys or hook-like processes. In muscles of this kind the action is in the direction of the reflected portion. The direction of muscles must be studied with reference to the axis of the body, but especially to the axis of the limb or lever, in relation to which they represent the moving power. Many muscles are almost parallel to the axis of the lever upon which they act; but it should also be remarked, that in certam positions these same muscles form greater or smaller angles with their corre- sponding levers, and may even become perpendicular to them. In this respect the direction of the muscles is not absolute, but is subordinate to the position of the levers. . , , , ,. , .■■ Some muscles are constantly perpendicular to the levers upon which they The angles of incidence of the muscles upon their points of attachments are very variable, but generaUy they are more nearly paraUel than perpendicular lo those point^. As the aiis of a muscle is not the same as that of com- ponent fibres, it is necessary to study, in each muscle, not only the direction of the fleshy belly but that of the fibres also. Relations or Connections of the Muscles. In reference to surgery, the relations or connections of the muscles are amone the most important circumstances in their history.

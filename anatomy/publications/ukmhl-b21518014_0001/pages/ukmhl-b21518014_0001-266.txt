The active organs of locomotion are called muscles.* They are composed of bundles of red or reddish fibres, consisting of fibrin as their basis, and pos- sessing the essential property of contractility, that is, the power of contracting or shortening upon the application of a stimulus, t Nomenclature of Muscles. The names applied to the various muscles have not been founded upon uni- form principle. Before the time of Sylvius the muscles of any region (of the thiffh for example) were designated numerically, first, second, &c. in the order of their super-position or of their uses. Sylvius first gave particular names to the greater number of the muscles ; and he was followed by almost aU succeeding anatomists, especially by Riolanus. In this nomenclature, which is still generally adopted, the names of the muscles are derived, 1. from their s tuation, as radialis, ulnaris, peroneus, &c.; 2. from their size as gluta^us maSmus minimus; palmaris longus, brevis, &c.; 3. from their direction, as "abdominis, obliqm capitis f 4. from their shape which is generally an Serfect representation, either of certain geometric figures, as rhomboideus. S^ramidalis and scalenus, or of well known objects, as deltoideus, lumbrici, Eoleu (from solea, the sole fish) ; 5. from their divisions or compbcation , as diSricus (from having two bellies), triceps (from having three heads), bLfps complexus, &c.; 6. from their insertions, as sterno-hyoid, stemo- thvroid &c ■ 7. from their uses, as flexors, abductors, &c. ^In modern times many attempts have been made to substitute m the place of the^e va?«eTnd generally arbitrary denominations, an uniform nomencla- this circumstance alone, preferable to any new appeUations.

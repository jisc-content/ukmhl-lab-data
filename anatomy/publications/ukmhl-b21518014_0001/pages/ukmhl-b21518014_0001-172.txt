ARTHROLOGY. 150 The Synovial Membranes, or Capsules. In every pan of the body where fibres move, they are surrounded by cel- lular tissue, which secretes a lubricating fluid to facilitate their motions; and, where surfaces move upon each other, they are covered by a membrane which exudes a fluid, varying in its nature, accordmg as the motions are confined to simple ghdTng, or ^are%ccompanied by a certain amount of friction, In the first case the membranes secrete a watery or serous fluid, and are consequently EomTnated sermu> membranes : in the second, the liquid is of an unctuous nature resembling white of egg; it is called synovia {avy with, and a,b^, an egg), and [he membranl synovial membrane. All the moveable articiJations are pro- vided wiTh a synovial membrane or capsule, by means of which the parts are lonstantly lubricated with a viscid unctuous fluid, that favours the exact adapt- ation of the articular surfaces, obviates the effects of friction, and maintams them in contact. This is the cause of the noise or cracking which results from the sudden separation of the articular surfaces. The synovial capsules, which have been well described by Monro are thin transpareymembranes, forming shut sacs, whi^ch cover the f eaj f the bo^^^^ without admitting them into the interior of the cavity. In fact, it is their SerS .«r/ace which adheres more or less intimately to the ligaments and other parts which surround the joint, while their tnten.al surfaces are in con- Set with each other, and are constantly lubricated by the synovia. It is a QuestTon among anatomists, whether the synovial membrane covers also the articSr cartuLes. It can only be traced by the knife as far as the circum- vent of Se^c^^^^^^ and it exists on them, which analogy wo^d le^ us to beUeve it is so completely modified as not to be recognisable.

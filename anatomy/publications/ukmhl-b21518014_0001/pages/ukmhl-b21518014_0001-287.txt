265 THE POSTERIOR SPINAL MUSCLES. muscles present only a few fasciculi in the neck, the transverso-spinalis * undergoes an enlargement in this region, so as to occupy the entire cervical groove (a and b,fig. 108.). In camivora, this portion of the muscle is enor- mously developed (much more so than in man), in consequence of those animals using the head and neck in seizing or struggling with prey. In mammalia, as in man, the dorsal portion of the transverso-spinalis is, as it were, hut a rudiment in the lumho-sacral region; the muscle is larger in man than in other animals, on account of his erect posture. Albinus de- scribed the enlarged cervical portion as a separate muscle, viz. the spinalis cervicis. In the neck, as in the other regions, the transverso-spinalis is a collection of super-imposed fasciculi, which arise from the transverse processes of the five or six upper dorsal, and from the articular processes of the five lower cervical vertebrae, and ai'e inserted into the spinous processes of the six lower cervical vertebra3: the highest and the largest fasciculus is attached to the axis. This muscle, which would have been much better named articulo-spinalis, is com- posed of several layers of fasciculi, placed one above the other, and extending from the whole length of the articular processes and laminae of the vertebrse below, to the whole length of the spinous processes and laminae of the vertebrae above. The length of these layers diminishes progressively from the more superficial {a, fig. 108.) to the deep-seated ones (6); the latter extend only from one vertebral lamina to another, and might be considered as proper muscles of the laminee, and not as a part of the transvei-so-spinahs muscle. The most superficial layer is composed of radiating fasciculi, diverging from one aiticular process to the summits of several of the spmous processes. The Complexus. Dissection. Divide the splenius perpendicularly to the direction of its fibres, and reflect the two parts upwards and downwards ; turn outwards the upper portions of the longissimus dorsi, the transversalis colli, and the trachelo- mastoid (see fig. 107.). The complexus (I, fig. 107.) is situated beneath the splenius at the posterior part of the neck and upper part of the back. It is a flat muscle, broad above but terminating in a point below. ' Attachments.

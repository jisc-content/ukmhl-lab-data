An exteriud sv^face (s h L 26.; andp b,fig. 27.) very irregular, which contributes to form the bottom of the zygomatic fossa above, and which is rough m front for union with the superior maxillary. This surface is traversed by a vertical groove which by it- self forms almost the entire extent oi the posterior palatine canal (g g,fig. 26.). 3. An anterior or maxillary border {i,fig. 27.), very thm and irregular, which advances so far forwards as to contract the entrance into the maxillary sinus, and presents a tongue of bone which is received into the fissure already de- scribed as existing at this orifice. 4. A posterior or pterygoid border {I, fig. 26.), which is appUed to the inner plate of the pterygoid process. There is below, at the angle formed by its union with the posterior edge of the horizontal por- tion, a very considerable process, for the size of the bone : this has been called palatine process, or tuberosity of the os palati (3, fig. 25.; I b, fig. 26.), but is better named pterygoid or pyramidal process: its base is continuous with the rest of the bone, and from this point it passes downwards, and is as it were inclosed in the bifurcation of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid. Its upper surface is traversed by three grooves, the middle of which forms part of the pterygoid fossa, and the lateral ones are rough and receive the summits of the two pterygoid plates. Below, the pyramidal process exhibits the orifices of the accessory ducts of the posterior palatine canal. Externally it presents a rough surface, which articulates above with the tuberosity of the superior maxilla, and which is free in the rest of its extent, and forms part of the zy- gomatic fossa. The middle of this process is grooved in a vertical direction, for the posterior palatine canal. 5. The inferior border of the vertical portion

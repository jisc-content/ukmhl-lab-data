24 OSTEOLOGY. 3. In the short boms. These are the latest in being ossified; a great number of them are stiU cartUaginous at birth. The short bones are not destitute of epi- physes, as is pioved by the ossification of the vertebra; and calcaneum. Their ossification in fine presents the same phases, and foUows the same_progress as that of the extremities of the long bones, which they resemble m so many respects. Changes which take place in Bones after Maturity. To obtain a complete notion of the development of the bones, we must not rest satisfied with ascertaining the number of points of ossification, their successive appearance, and their mode of junction; we must also study the changes which they undergo after they hdve attained their full growth The increase of the bones in height tei-minates when their several pieces have become united: the time when this is accompUshed varies fi;om the age of twenty to thirty years ; but they continue to mcrease m thickness for a considerable time longer. In proof of this we need only compare t^e bone of a young man with those of an adult of forty. In old age the bones still un- dergo important changes : the medullary canal of the long bones augments in width, and the thickness of its parietes diminishes m proportion ; and somethmg similar takes place in the broad and the short bones. Another important fact to be here mentioned is, that the relative proport on of calcareous phosphate and animal matter undergoes contmual changes in the bourse of life. Thus by an analysis of Dr. I. Davy it was shown, that the propor- tion of cacareous phosphate was a fifth less in a child of fifteen years than in raduU ThesaL an adroccipital was to that in an occipital bone of an aged person as sixty-four to sixty-nine. Nutrition of Bones. The fact of the nutrition of bones and the process of composition and decomposition in which it consists, appear to me to be demonstrated by the ex- periment with madder. If an animal is fed for some tims with food impreg- nated with he iuice of madder, its bones soon become coloured red, as may be S rtaTfd b^'imputating a Uilib ; but by suspending the - of^hat subs^^^^^^^ 5^.:-;^n:^haJr=:s^^^ that the siwth of bones takes place by the successive deposition of new tnattne {,iovviu „„Hprmnst or contisuous layers of the periosteum, ihus 17'" bSe"f-d1mP^^^^^^^ wit/madder, sLpend the use of let a Pff°'^„^'^f,^7"\e° renew itT after this, the bones when cut through secondly, by juxtaposition. 11 i,P thp foUowiuf?: — May not the colourins matter be jcct to the same vicissitudes ?

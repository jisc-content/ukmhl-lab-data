404 APONEUROLOGY. Fig. 138. is an extremely strong triangular layer (ba, fg. 138.*), occupying the pubic arch and apparent- ly forming a con- tinuation of the sub-pubic liga- ment (6). It is ver- tical near the arch, as far as the ball of the urethra, below ■which it becomes horizontal, or ra- ther oblique, from before backwards. Its lateral margins are attached to the descending rami of the ossa pubis, and the ascending rami of the ischia (rf </), above the attachment of the ischio-cavernosi muscles. Its posterior margin, becomes blended with the posterior margin of the superficial perineal fascia, behmd the transversi muscles, in front of the perineal fossse, of which it forms the anterior boundary. Relations. Its lower surface is in relation with the ischio- and bulbo-caver- nosus muscles, and gives off in the median line a fibrous septum, which passes between these muscles, and affords them points of attachment. Its upper sur- face is in relation with the artery or arteries (e e) of the bulb, which are sometimes contained within its substance : it is also in contact with a very re- markable plexus of large veins, with which it is very closely united, so that when divided they remain open : these veins are also frequently enclosed within its substance. It is also in relation with the levator am. There constantly exists another transverse muscle, very distinct froni the transversus perinei generally described, which is situated further behind. This muscle (transversus perinei alter, Alb.) is applied to the lower surface ot the perineal fascia, and passes transversely inwards to the bulbous portion of the urethra. , , , , ■ . The deep fascia of the perineum is perforated (at c) by the posterior pait of the bulb of the urethra, or rather by the point of umon(c,^jr. 181.) between its bulbous and membranous portions: it gives off prolongations upon the sides ot the bulb, and serves to support the membranous portion of the urethra: wbence the name, triangular ligament of the urethra, given to it by CoUes. It is also perforated beneath the arch of the pubes by a great number of vems, and by ^""c/seT^'This remarkable aponeurosis evidently supports the canal of the urethra.

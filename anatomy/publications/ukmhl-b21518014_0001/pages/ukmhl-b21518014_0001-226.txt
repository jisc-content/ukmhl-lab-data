204 ARTHROLOGY. performed by the pelvis in standing is connected with the transmission of the weight of the trunk to the lower extremities ; this is effected by means of the sacrum, which rests upon the ossa innominata. We should add, that a amall ' portion of the weight is directly transmitted to the femora by the iliac bones, which support the viscera of the abdomen; and in regard to this I would re- mark, that the breadth and separation of the iliac fossa? m man, as compared with other animals, have an evident relation to his erect posture. The following arrangements should be noted as bemg concerned m the trans- mission of the weight by means of the sacrum:-!. The great size of that bone, affording evidence of the destination of man for the erect posture. 2. The ob- tuse angle at which the sacrum unites with the vertebral column, peculiar to the human species, and which becomes the seat of a decomposition of the force transmitted by the spine. Part of the momentum acting in the direction of the axis of the column, has no other effect than that of increasing the sacro- vertebral angle, at the expense of the flexibility of the inter-articulai; cartilage ; the rest is transmitted to the sacrum, and then to tlie lower extremities 3. The double wedge shape of the sacrum itself. In order to understand the advantage arming from this form, it is necessary to remark, first, that the weight of the trunk is transmitted in the axis of the upper half of the sacrum, and, conse- quently, in the direction of a line sloping downwards and backwards: from this it follows, that the sacrum must have a tendency to be displacea either downwards or backwards, but the displacement downwards is F^^e^t^dby the position of the ossa innominata, which are I^^arer to each other below than above. The displacement backwards is obviated by the obhque direc ion of tWrticular surLes of the same bones backwards and ^-is -h^^^^^^^^ obUquity of the sacrum itself is in the opposite direction, for it is bioadei m front than behind.* 4.

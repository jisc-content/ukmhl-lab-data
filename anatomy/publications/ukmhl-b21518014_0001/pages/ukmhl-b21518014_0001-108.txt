OSTEOLOGY. 86 THE THORAX, OR CHEST. The sternum. — Ribs. —Costal carliluycs. —The tJiorax in general.— Development. The thorax {Sidspat,, the chest) is a sort of bony cage intended to contain and protect the principal organs of respiration and circvdation. The parts which enter into its composition are twelve dorsal vertebrse behind, the sternum in front, and twelve flexible bones, named ribs, on each side. We have already described the dorsal vertebrse, and have now therefore only to notice the sternun!. and the ribs. The Sternum (a b c,fig 38.). The sternum, so named from the Greek word mifvov, the breast, is a kind of flattened symmetrical bony column, which occupies the anterior and middle part of the thorax. It is situated between the ribs, which support it like props. The clavicles, and through them the upper extremities, rest upon its upper part as a basis, during their movements. The sternum is not immoveably fixed in its place ;' it is raised and depressed as we shall point out in descnbmg the mechanism of the thorax. . ■ e i The length of the sternum, which is proportionally smaUer in the temale, than in the male, varies from 5^ to 1\ inches. At its upper part its breadth is from li to 2 inches ; it then becomes contracted, then again expands, and ter- minates below in a very narrow extremity. Its thickness above is about 6 lines ; at its lower part it is much thinner, never exceedmg 3 Imes. With regard to figure, the sternum was compared by the ancients to the sword of a gladiator, and from this have arisen the denominations given to its various parts The upper part (a), which is broadest, has been caUed the handle (manubrium) ; the middle part (6) the body {mucro); and h>wer e^ tremity (c), the point; xiphoid appendix {processus ensiforms). This division of the bone into three parts has been retained by some modem anatomists who describe ?he three pieces of the sternum separately as so many distmct bones We shaU adhere to it only, however, in speaking of the development of the ^°The sternum presents two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities. iThe anterJ or cutaneous surface is sUghtly convex, and forms an oblique plane downwards and forwards; it presents three or four projecting transverse Les which are traces of the union of the original pieces of the tone and SeTt i^to surfaces of unequal size.

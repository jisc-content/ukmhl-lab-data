633 THE PERITONEUM. â– when, on the other hand, it is distended and rises into the abdomen, the peri- ' toneum retires before it, and the bladder then comes into direct contact with the anterior wall of the abdomen, so that it can be reached by the surgeon without wounding the peritoneum. ' From the posterior surface of the blad- der the peritoneum is reflected upon the other pelvic organs, being arranged dif- ferently in the two sexes. In thfe- male it is reflected from the bladder upon the rec- tum, forming two lateral semilunar folds, called the posterior ligaments of the bladder, and a cul-de-sac between them of variable depth, which sometimes reaches as low as the prostate.* In the female it is reflected from the posterior surface of the bladder upon the neck of the uterus (m), forming a cul-de-sac between the two, so that the inferior fundus of the bladder is entirely uncovered by it. It then covers the two surfaces and the superior border of the uterus, and forms two lateral, broad, trans- verse folds (the ligamenta lata), each of which is subdivided superiorly into three smaller folds, the ala vespertilionis or alee of the broad ligament, the anterior fold corresponding with the round ligament, the middle one to the Fallopian tube, and the posterior fold to the ovai'y. The peritoneum has no relation with the front of the vagina (u), but it covers the upper third of that canal behind; from thence it is reflected upon the rectum (r), and has then the same arrangement in both sexes. Inferiorly it is limited to the anterior surface of the gut, but superiorly it entirely surrounds it, excepting behind, where it forms a dupli- cature known as the mesorectum. After leaving the cavity of the pelvis, the peritoneum continues to ascend, so as to cover the posterior wall of the abdomen; in this situation we shall ex- amine it in the middle and at the sides. In the viiddle it passes in front of the sacro-vertebral angle, then in front of the lumbar vertebrae, and having arrived opposite an oblique line, extending from the left side of the second lumbar vertebra to the right iliac fossa, it is reflected forwards to constitute the left layer (jn) of the mesentery (fi4aos, middle, evrepov, an intestine) ; it immediately expands, so as to correspond to the whole length of the small intestine (i), lines the left lateral half, the con- vex borders, and the right lateral half of that intestine, and then passing from before backwards (m') is applied to the back of the layer just described, and in this manner forms the mesentery (m m'), the largest of all the duplicatures of the peritoneum, and remarkable for its resemblance to a plaited ruffle. On the left side the peritoneum, after having formed the viesorectum, then forms the iliac mesocolon, a considerable fold, which allows great mobility to the sigmoid flexure of the colon. From the sigmoid flexure it is prolonged upon the left lumbar colon, covering the anterior five-sixths of that part of tlie intestine, and applying it against the kidney, but without forming any du- * The peritoneum, forming the cul-de-sac between the bladder and the rectum sometlmps had man^^hildrai''''""'^'' '""^ P""*^'"^ "'^ abdomen in women who have

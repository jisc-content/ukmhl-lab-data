76 OSTEOLOGY. the pituitary membrane, and present small vascular and nervous furrows. The superior or sphenoidal border (/;, fig. 35. and 3, fig. 22.) is the shortest and thickest: It IS marked by a deep groove which receives the inferior crest of the sphenoid; the two lips of the groove are bent outwards, and received into furrows on the inferior surface of the same bone, and thus complete a small channel for the passage of vessels and nervous filaments. The inferior or maxillary (c) border is the longest, and is received into the furrow which is formed by the union of the two palate bones, behind, and of the two superior maxillary in front: it some- times terminates by a more or less prominent process behind the anterior nasal spine. The anterior or ethmoidal border (d, fig. 35. and 3 4, fig. 22.) presents the continuation of the groove on the superior edge, and receives the inferior border of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid. There is no groove, where it is attached to the cartilaginous septum. The posterior or guttural edge {e,fig. 35. and t, 10, fig. 22.) is free: it is thin and sharp, and inclines downwards and forwards : it separates the posterior openings of the nasal fossaj. Connections. The vomer is articulated with the sphenoid, the ethmoid, the superior maxillary, the palate bones, and the cartilage of the septum. Internal structure. The vomer is composed of two very thin compact lamina; which are distinct above but united below. Some anatomists have called these plates, alcB of the vomer. _ Development. It is developed from one point of ossification, which is situated at the lower part of the bone, and appears before the end of the se- cond month. It then presents the form of a deep groove, embracing the car- tilage just as at a future period it embraces the sphenoidal crest. At birth the vomer is still only a groove; afterwards this condition is confined to the sphenoidal and ethmoidal edges of the bone. It is not uninteresting to note the peculiar and uncommon manner in which the ossification proceeds from the surface to the interior of the cartilage. fig. 36. Inferior Maxilla (Jig. 36.). While, as we have before observed, a considerable number of bones enter into the formation of the upper jaw, the lower jaw consists of one bone only. The inferior maxilla occupies the lower part of the face. It has the shape of a parabolic curve, the two ex- tremities of which, called rami, form a right angle with the middle portion or body. Of the body or middle portion (a). The body represents a curved plate, convex in front and concave behind. It offers to our notice an anterior and a posterior surface, and a supe- rior and inferior border. The anterior surface has in the middle a verticalline, QvAXed, symphysis menli (c d) : it marks the place of union of the two pieces of which this bone is composed in young subjects, and which in a crrpat number of animals remain distinct through lite. ^Tiem^de in which the two halves of the body of the inferior r^^ff^l united forming an arch, instead of an angle as in other animals, constitutes one ch^ers^i^th.hâ€ž fact:^d?S:iroXri^^^^^^^^^ th^lower animals, is a no less cha- r'^en^tic mark of man, called mental pr^^%^t^S:^l^ smalf tubercles, two superior and Kio inint - mil .IS a Similar arrangement obtains be- Je^\lXr>.re?oF'^hTu?pTr1aT.*e^^ arc enabled to swallow an object much larger than their head, or even than their body.

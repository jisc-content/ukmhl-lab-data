It is of a circular form and t^fnsS s a proingation of the synovial capsule. The other, which is not con- slant is situated niar the concave surface of the acromion process ; a second prolongation of the synovial capsule passes through it, and establishes a com- Ecftion between that of the joint and one belongmg to the infra-spmatus ^""imr-articular ligament. This name may, with propriety, be applied to the tendon (t, fig. 70.) of the long head of the biceps, which, arismg from the upper part of the glenoid cavity, turns like a cord over the head of the humerus, and passes aloni the bicipital groove. It acts by keeping the head of the humerus appUed to the glenoid cavity, and forms a sort of arch that supports the hone when it is forced upwards. In two subjects, I found this tendon termmatmg by a strong adhesion in the bicipital groove, and thus justifying the name ot inter-articular Ugament, which I have applied to it: the tendon for the long head of the biceps took its origin from the same groove. I consider this division of the tendon to have been accidental, for the bicipital groove was depressed, and the inter-articular ligament flattened, and as it were lacerated. The synovial capsule is remarkable, inasmuch as, 1. It forms a fold round the tendon of the biceps, which is prolonged into the bicipital groove, and termi- nates below by a cul-de-sac or circular fold, which prevents the effusion of the synovia; 2. It is open in one or two points*, and presents two prolongations communicating with the synovial bursre of the subscapularis and infra-spinatus. Supplementary cavity. "We may regard as a dependence of the scapulo-humeral articulation the vaulted arch formed by the coracoid and acromion processes, and the ligament which unites them. In shape it corresponds to the head of the humerus, and is so constructed that the coracoid process prevents displace- ment inwards; the acromion prevents it upwards and outwards; and the liga- ment between them opposes dislocation directly upwards. This provision evi- dently compensates for the incomplete, reception of the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity. The utility of this vault, and the frequent pressure of the head of the humerus * [Although the synovial capsule of the shoulder-joint is thus occasionally prolonged into the bursa; murosa; connected with the tendons of these muscles, it must not, therefore, be sup- posed thiit it is an exception to the general rule that membranes of tliis nature always form sluit sacs ; in such cases the three structures constitute one continuous cavity.] N 'I

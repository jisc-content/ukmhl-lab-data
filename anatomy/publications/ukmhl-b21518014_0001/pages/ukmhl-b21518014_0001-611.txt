The mucous membrane not unfrequently becomes insinuated between these columns, so as to form cells, or what is termed sacculated bladder. The base of the bladder presents three » The varieties in the deptli of the cul-de-sac formed by the reflected peritoneum pointed out bv modern surgeons, appear to me to be explicable by the difference m size of the bladders examined.

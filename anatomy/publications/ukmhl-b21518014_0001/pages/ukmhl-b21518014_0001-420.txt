APONEUROLOGY. 398 tion, as -well as with the iliac fascia and the fascia of the thigh, so that in this situation there is a thickening rather than an actual reflection of the aponeu- rosis. Internally to the psoas and iliacus, however (at a), the direct and reflected portions are perfectly distinct, and form a groove with its concavity upwards, which we shaU find to assist in the formation of the inguinal canal. These two separate portions of the inner part of the femoral arch require a special description. The direct portion (part of which is shown turned downwards at d,fig. 137.), passes on to be attached to the spine of thepubes {p,figs. 136,137.),becomingmore and more prominent, so that it can be easily felt under the skin, especially when the thigh is extended upon the pelvis. The reflected portion, externally, is narrow, and as it were folded ; but internally it becomes expanded, from its fibres slightly changing their direction, and diverging, so as to be inserted into the spine of the pubes behind the direct portion, and also into the pecten or crest of the pubes. This reflected and expanded portion, described even in the oldest anatomical works, has become celebrated in recent times under the improper name of Gimbernat's ligament (g,fig. 136.), from a Spanish surgeon, who pointed out its importance as the seat of stricture in femoral hernia. It is triangular in shape; its anterior margin corresponds to the crural arch; its posterior margin to the crest of the pubes ; its outer margin is free, concave, tense, and sharp, and forms the inner part of the circumference of the crural ring (r). This con- cavity, against which the protruded intestine becomes strangulated, has ob- tained for the ligament the name of the falciform ligament or fold* Its strength is very considerable; but occasionally intervals are left between its fibres, through which hernial protrusions may take place.f From the lower surface of Gimbernat's ligament a fibrous prolongation is given off, which sometimes represents a second arch below the fenioral arch, and assists in forming the superficial layer of the fascia lata of the thigh. This tendinous expansion has a great effect in rendering the arch tense. We may add, that there is considerable variation in different subjects, both in the strength and developement of Gimbernat's ligament; varieties that must have great influence on the position of crural hemiae, and on the seat of strangulation m that disease. Behind the femoral arch, on the outer side of Gimbernat's Uga- ment, is an opening (a to r, fig. 136.) or ring, intended to give passage to the femoral artery (a) and vein (v), and to a great number of lymphatic vessels and glands : this is the crural ring-X The sub-peritoneal cellular tissue some- times acquires great strength opposite this ring, and constitutes what is called the crural septum (situated at r). The form of the crural ring is that of an isosceles triangle, the base of which is very long, and formed by the crural arch, the inner border by the pectineus, and the outer by the psoas and iliacus muscles. Of the three angles the internal is rounded, and corresponds to the concave mar- oin of Gimbernat's ligament; the external angle, opposite which the epigastric artery is situated, is very acute, and corresponds to the point at which the ie- moral arch separates from the iliac fascia; the posterior angle is very obtuse, and corresponds to the ilio-pectineal eminence (d). , , , c The femoral vein is in relation with the inner or pectineal border ot this triangular space; the femoral artery with the iUo-pectineal eminence and the » [This term is noiv generaUy applied (after Burns) to the external margin of the saphenous "^^WZ\&r^h3:sUtZ^^eZrd^^^^ of hernia through the fibres of Gimbernat's ligament.

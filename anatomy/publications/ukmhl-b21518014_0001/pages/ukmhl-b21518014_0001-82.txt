OSTEOLOGY. 60 large extremity turned backwards. It is nevei- perfectly symmetrical; but a very great deviation has always appeared to me coincident with disease. From attentive examination of a great number of skulls of idiots and maniacs, I have observed that in these subjects there is a remarkable difference between the two sides. The dimensions of the cranium have been very accurately determined by Bichat. The antero-posterior diameter, measured from the foramen cfficum to the occipital protuberance, is about five inches* ; the transverse diameter, measured between the base of the petrous portions of the temporal bones, is four inches and a half; the vertical diameter, extending from the anterior edge of the foramen magnum to the middle of the sagittal suture, is rather less than the transverse. In front, and behin(f the spot where the height and breadth of the cranium are measured, i. e. in front and behind the bases of the petrous bones, the diameters progressively diminish. Hence it follows that the point where the cranium has the greatest capacity, is the junction of the two anterior thirds with the posterior third; that is to say, at the place of meeting, or, if I may use the expression, at the confluence of the brain, cere- bellum, and spinal marrow. The cranium, however, presents many varieties, both in regard to its di- mensions and shape. The varieties of form of the skull in different individuals appear generally to depend upon the preponderance of one diameter over another; and it may be remarked that in these cases, where one diameter is much increased, the others are almost invariably diminished in the same pro- portion, so that the absolute difference in size is by no means considerable. There are also variations in size and figure peculiar to the crania of differ- ent nations, as has been shown by the researches of Blumenbach and Soem- merring. In the white or Caucasian race the cranium is decidedly much larger than in the others, more especially than in the negro. Among certain tribes, the configui-ation of the cranium is determined by the permanent or frequently repeated compressions to which the skulls of infants are subjected. It vanes also according to age and sex, being proportionally larger in the foetus than in the adult, and in the male than in the female. It should be remarked that all these varieties are exclusively confined to the vault of the cavity. Since the cranium is exactly moulded upon the brain, great interest has been attached to the exact appreciation of its dimensions, and hence the different measm-e- ments which have been adopted for this purpose.^ The oldest is the one proposed by Camper, under the name of the facial angle. This angle is intended to measure the relative proportions of the cranium and face. It is taken by drawing one line from the middle incisors of the upper jaw, along the front of the forehead, and another from the same point to the auditory meatus The angle included between these lines is in the European trom ^0° to 85° • in the Mongolian race 75°, and in the Negro 70°. This anatomical fact had not escaped the attention of the ancients. We observe that m the statues of their heroes and gods, they have even exaggerated the facial angle, which is generally 90°, and even more in the case of Jupiter lonans. The facial angle gives no information respecting the capacity of the poste- rio^ regions of tte cranium, and consequently Daubenton had this speciaUy in v^ew in h°s mode of measurement, which bears the name of the occpital angle of Dauhenm This, however, Uke the preceding, and in fact aU hnear measure- ments IppUed to the determination of the capacity of the skull, is necessarily ments, appuett to I ^he walls of the cavity, the greater or less inexact. ^J^^^;^^™^^ projection of the alveoli, or their obliteration after loss ot tl^e teem a ^ facial and the occipital angle can been ^"ti'-^ly ^^^^'f^^,:^ direction.

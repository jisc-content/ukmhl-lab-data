The Cranium. The cranium {Kpavos, a helmet) is a round osseous case, composed of eight hones that is, of eight pieces, distinct and separable after the complete deve- lopment of the skeleton. Four of these are single, and placed on the median line • viz (counting from behind forwards), the occipital, the sphenoid, the ethmoid, and the frontal: the remaining four are in pairs, and are situated laterally • viz the two parietal and the two temporal. To these must be added the small supernumerary bones, denominated ossa wormiana,or triquelra. The Occipital Bone {figs. 9. and 10.). The occipital bone occupies the posterior, inferior, and middle portion of the cranium, a great part of the base of which it constitutes.* Below it is articulated with the vertebral column; in front with the sphenoid; and it is, as it were, wedged in between the parietal and temporal bones of the right and left sides. It is broad and symmetrical; in shape an irregular segment of a spheroid, notched round the circumference. It has an anterior and a poste- rior surface, and a circumference, having/our borders and four angles. The posterior or cutaneous surface (fig. 9.) is convex, and presents the inferior orifice of the occipital foramen, {\,fig. 9. ; d, ^* .r" „ - fig. 21.) (foramen magnum), the largest of all the fo- ramina in the skeleton, excepting the sub-pubic, or obturator foramen of the os innominatum. It gives passage to the spinal marrow with its envelopes, the spinal accessory nerves, and vertebral arteries. In front of the foramen is the inferior surface of the basilar process (2, fig. 9.; n,fig. 21.) which forms the bony roof of the pharynx; it is placed horizontally, is rough, and has a ridge in the median line more or less prominent in different subjects. Behind the foramen, and in the median line, is the external occi- pital ridge {perpendicular spine) (3 4, fig. 9.; c a, fig. 21 ) extending ft-om the posterior edge of the fora- men to the external occipital protuberance. This projection is wanting in some individuals, and in others its place is occupied by a depression On each side of the ridg; are unequal surfaces bounded above by a Ime with the concavity Inokine downwards. Thus, the superior semicircular line (5 5, fig. 9., a o,jig. 20 comm^ces at the occipital protuberance (4, fig. 9.; a, fig. 20.) and pro- ceeds Sontally outwards."^ The irregular surface included between this line and the foramen! is again divided by a line whose concavity is directed up- wards (-6 6, fiq. 9.), and which is called the inferior semicircular line. On each Se of the occipital foramen, and towards the fore part are the ; 7.C r7 7 9 • e fiQ. 21.), two articular eminences, convex, elliptical, di- condylcs (7 ^l^^d-^-'/^^d- ^ ^-^^^^^ mwards, their surfaces lookmg rected from articulate with the atlas.

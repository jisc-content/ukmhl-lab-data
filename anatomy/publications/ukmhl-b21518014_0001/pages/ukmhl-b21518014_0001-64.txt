42 OSTEOLOGY. point belonging at once to the lateral masses, and half of the arch on each side. They appear in the following order : — those for the posterior arch make their appearance from the fortieth to the fiftieth day ; those for the an- tei-ior arch not until during the first year after birth. The two osseous points of the posterior arch unite together, those of the anterior arch do the same, and then the anterior is united to the posterior arch. Axis. There are often two osseous points for the body of this bone, and always two lateral ones for the odontoid process: it has, therefore, in all five or six points, -viz. two for the laminaj or posterior arch, one or two for the body, and two for the odontoid process. Meckel and Nesbit admit one other nucleus between the odontoid process and the body, which appears in the course of the first year after birth. The points in the laminte appear from the fortieth to the l^tieth day ; those in the body during the sixth month ; and those in the odontoid process, a short time after. At birth the body of the axis is pro- portionally more developed than that of the other vertebraj. The union of its several parts takes place in the foUowing order:-the two laminaj are joined toeether shortly after birth; the two points of the odontoid process remam dis- tinct during the whole of the first year ; the body and the odontoid process are united m the course of the third year ; and the lamin£e and the body durmg the fourth or fifth year. Seventh cervical vertebra. Independently of the osseous points common to aU the vertebrce, this bone has two others situated on each side of the body in the cartilage which fonns the anterior half of the transverse process. The existence of this point, which was described by Hunauld,but which does not annear to me to be constant, establishes an analogy between the transverse processes of the cervical vertebras and the ribs ; it represents in a rudimentary state the permanent cervical ribs of some animals ; and explams an anomaly wSch is not very uncommon in the human subject, viz. the existence of a "'7^;;'"^T/£m!

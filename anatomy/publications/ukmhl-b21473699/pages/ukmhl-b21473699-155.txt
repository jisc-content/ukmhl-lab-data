125 LECTURE FOURTH. But, to leave the dreams and idle visions of this fanatic, let us novf see how much better founded are several pretensions of some of our physiological chemists, and whether the existence of some other cause, besides these chemical affinities, be not neces- sary to account for that combination and arrangement of parts which we observe in the animal structure. When we observe the number of bones, joints, cartilages, veins, arteries, lymphatics, glands, nerves, ligaments, and membranes,—all of them differing from one another, all of them, however, of deter- mined shapes, situations, and uses, and all of them . growing at the same time;—when we see the num- ber of chemical processes by which they are formed, differing in kind, but not interfering; or similar in kind, but producing works of a different form ; and, although contiguous, always distinct in their opera- tions ; when we see the same chemical processes, employed in the other half of the system, perform- ing the like variegated works in the same way, and in the same time; when we see them change and succeed one another according to the stated periods of life, and yet all their actions regularly co-operat- ing, all of them dependent on one another, all of them contributing to one end, all of them construct- ing one whole, to be subservient to one will, and

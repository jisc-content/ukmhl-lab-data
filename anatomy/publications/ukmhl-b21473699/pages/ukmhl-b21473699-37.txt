LECTUllE FIRST. 7 whole science, without which no lasting structure . can be raised. In the adult or grown-up subject, the bones are the hardest and most solid parts of the whole sys- tem, and, though not the only, are the principal parts that give it form, stability, and posture. At birth, many are soft, flexible, transparent, with scarcely any osseous matter ; others contain several portions of this matter to be afterwards extended ; and others their full and ultimate proportions which they have at the advanced periods of life. One set of them, called the Temporary Teeth, twenty in number, are shed in the latter periods of infancy; reckoning the thirty-two which succeed, with the other bones belonging to the skeleton, the whole" amount, in the human subject, to about 245. As they give form, stability, and posture, we must suppose them to be somehow connected. Upon examination, we find them connected by unequal surfaces, whose cavities and eminences mutuallv â€¢I correspond ; these connections are called Articula- tions, and are naturally divided into three kinds. The first, admitting of a free, easy, and conspicuous motion; the second, of a motion that is rather ob- scure ; and the third, of a motion that is next to imperceptible : these three kinds, with their species

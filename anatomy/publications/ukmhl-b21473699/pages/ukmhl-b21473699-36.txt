LECTURE FIRST. 6 now to give, will be more entertaining than a num- ber of dry unconnected definitions, not easily remem- bered, and more instructive than any anatomical fiction whatever. The difficulty is how to begin. As all the parts of the human body are mutually dependent on one another, and as we must return to the same point from which we set out in the descrip- tion, on a cursory view, it may seem indifferent where we begin. Experience, however, and observa- tion have shown, that we commence at one point with much more advantage than at another; and, therefore, the general and most approved order of demonstration shall, in this instance, determine the choice; for there is certainly some advantage in ad- hering to the same method of arrangement : it does much to prevent confusion, to assist the memory, and facilitate afterwards a clear and accurate com- prehension of the subject. Now the first parts to which the attention is usu- ally directed in a Course of Anatomy, is the Bones, and that branch which treats of these organs is styled Osteology,â€”a branch of Anatomy of much more importance in Surgery, Physic, and Natural History, than is generally supposed. According to Winslow, Albinus, Monro, and indeed every dis- tinguished anatomist, it is the foundation of the

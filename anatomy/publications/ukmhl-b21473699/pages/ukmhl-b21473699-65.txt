35 LECTURE SECOND. D 2 terpreter. The circulation was thus made known, for the first time; and, though some physiologists en- deavoured to obscure it by their false glosses and interpretations, yet anatomy as regularly brought forward the facts to speak for themselves, and at last succeeded in establishing the truth beyond the possibility of contradiction. In the following course, I shall, therefore, with Hunter, consider anatomy and physiology to be as they ought to be, inseparably connected, and combin- ed together as closely as they are in the great elemen- tary work of Haller. In this view, anatomy will not only furnish us with the facts, but with the explana- tions, so far as they are warranted by ocular demon- stration, while, at the same time, it will guard us against being duped by hypotheses that rest upon the evidence of oral testimony, which exhibits facts through a false medium, and which have so often disgraced the pages of physiology. In this sense, I may safely venture to say of anatomy, that it is not only ornamental and useful, but even indispensable to the surgeon and physician, who, as guardians of health, can never be qualified, either to preserve, im- prove, or restore it, as long as they are strangers to the nature of the organs, or the state of the func- tions on which it depends.

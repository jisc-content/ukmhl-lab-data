11 LECTURE FIRST. although we shall find that its principal function is widely different, and that it performs a still more important office in the body. As yet, we have only seen how the bones are joined by articulating surfaces, and how they are preserved in their situation by connecting substan- ces. We have now to inquire by what causes they are put in motion. On a slight examination, we soon perceive, that the causes of all the motions of the body are bundles of flesh, which bundles, or fasciculi, anatomists, borrowing a term from the Greek, have denominated Muscles. Many of the muscles, besides flesh, contain a substance some- what like ligament; and many, through the me- dium of this substance, adhereix) the bones : this is the substance, that, in common language, is called Sinew, but in Anatomy is better known by the name of Tendon. Both are constituent parts of a muscle, the flesh and the tendon : both are equally composed of fibres obvious to the sight, and these fibres composed of others that are still smaller, and the smaller fibres composed of others smaller and smaller, so far as they can be traced by the microscope. But even the fibres, obvious to the sight, are never enumerated, nor indeed all the fasciculi or bundles which they compose. Of the fas-

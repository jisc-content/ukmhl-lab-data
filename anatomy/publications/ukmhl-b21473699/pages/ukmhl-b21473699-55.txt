LECTURE FIRST. By the assistance of all these juices, by the heat of the body, and by the action of the canal, which possesses a degree of muscular power, all the nutri- tious part of the alinient is converted into a white and thin fluid,in colour similar to milk, which is term- ed Chyme. If we could shew how this chyme gets in- to the blood, we should solve the problem, how the blood receives its regular supplies, and from what source the system is nourished. The ancients thought that the chyme entered by the red veins that spread upon the intestinal tube. Their opinion, however, was hasty and erroneous. The truth, here, was a secret in Anatomy for many ages, until Asellius, an Italian anatomist,* chancing to open a live dog, discovered, by accident, a number of ves- sels, different from the veins, opening into the tube, and absorbing the chyme, which, on entering these vessels, assumed the name of Chyle. These vessels, from their milky-coloured fluid, were called Lacteals, and were afterwards traced uniting together, enter- ing the trunk of the lymphatics, and sending their fluid into those veins which open through the me- dium of its auricle, into the right ventricle of the heart. â€¢ Erasistratus also had seen these vessels, but knew not their functions.

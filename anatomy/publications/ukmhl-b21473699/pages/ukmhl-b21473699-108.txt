78 LECTURE THIRD. that, in his opinion, the cause was worthy of inves- tigation ; and it is rather surprising that he, but particularly Aristotle, who considered the explana- tion of these motions of so much importance, that he has written two books on the subject, should, notwithstanding, be ignorant of the organs from which they more immediately, and I almost might say, obviously proceeded. But indeed the igno- rance of Aristotle here, is another proof of how little the structure had been investigated in his time : the motions were then ascribed to the Neura, and Neura signified, indifferently, ligaments, ten- dons, or arteries. The arteries were the neura to which Aristotle was naturally led to ascribe the mo- tions. Their pulsations were felt through almost every part of the system ; they had their origin in the left ventricle, where Hippocrates had placed the fountain of life and of animal heat; and, being ge- nerally found empty at death, they were supposed to contain only certain vital and aerial spirits, which regularly flowing from the fountain of life, diffused heat, animation, and motion, through the whole members. This variety of functions ascribed to the arteries, you will easily perceive, superseded the functions of the brain and muscles, and fully ex- plains the singular notions which Aristotle enter-

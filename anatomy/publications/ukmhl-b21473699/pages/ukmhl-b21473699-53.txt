LECTURE FIRST. 23 pied, or to be thrown by some emuiictories out of the system. If they return to undergo new prepa- rations, and remain in the system, for what purpose are the regular and constant supplies of nourish- ment ? For, if the supplies of aliment be necessa- ry, it will be difficult to assign a reason why the decayed parts of the system should be retained. But the supplies of aliment are necessary, and there- fore it follows that the decayed parts of the system should be thrown out. The conclusion, however, necessarily involves us in new embarrassments : For by what channels are we to discharge them ? To do this, we must have recourse to those small arterial vessels that wander from the course of the circulation, that was known to Harvey. Many of these, as mentioned already, open externally upon the skin, and upon the internal surface of the lungs ; others terminate in two large glands, which are call- ed Kidneys, and in which the urinary fluid is se- creted; many also discharge their contents into that long, winding canal, which begins at the mouth, and terminates at the opposite extremity of the body. By these outlets we are able to demonstrate how, along with the vapour from the lungs, the perspir- able matter from the skin, the fecal discharge, and the urine, all the decayed parts are evacuated.

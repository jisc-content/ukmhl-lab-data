XVIII LIFE OF DR. BARCLAY. home in superintending the printing of the first part of these Lectures, and in writing the Lives of Aris- totle and of Harvey, two of his favourite authors : these, however, were not left sufficiently complete to be given to the world. In the course of the following spring and summer. Dr. Barclay fell off rapidly, without any very marked disease ; his speech became much impaired, evidently from a paralytic affection. He was subject to occasional attacks of dyspnoea, and these recurred in pa- roxysms, so as to lead him to consider his com- plaints as asthmatic. For several weeks previous to his death, he was so much debilitated as to be constantly confined to bed, was able to take very little sustenance, and sunk exhausted on the 21st of August, 1826. During his illness, the Doctor was constantly watched and assiduously nursed by Mrs. Barclay, who lives to lament his loss. He was attend- ed professionally by his eminent and esteemed friend Dr. Hamilton, Sen. by his brother-in-law Dr. Johjn Campbell, and by the author of the present brief and imperfect sketch of his life, who, while employed for several years as his assistant, had frequent opportunities of witnessing his many estimable private virtues ; but from any attempt to delineate these, he is deterred by the conviction that he owes too much to his deceased friend and master, to consider himself, or to be looked upon by others, as an impartial judge.

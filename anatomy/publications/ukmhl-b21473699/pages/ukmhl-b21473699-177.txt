COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. 147 ever compensate for the want of the originals ; they ffive not the same relish nor interest, nor aflPord the same correctness of ideas. Even when accurate, they but assist the imagination to conceive the things which they represent; and if they be other- wise, as they frequently are, they tend to mislead it, and become, not unusually, the strongly fortified depots of error. In short, at their best, they are only shadows in place of the substances, and if they be faulty, they are worse than shadows, because they are shadows without any substance, or prototype in nature. To illustrate the general scope of this rea- soning, let any one read the history of a coun- try, study its maps, and afterwards visit the coun- try itself. If he travel through it with any at- tention, he will generally find it a different coun- try from what either his reading or his maps led him to suppose. His visit will produce livelier impressions, a deeper interest, and more accu- rate conceptions; it will even give an additional relish to the perusal of his history; and his map will reflect a new kind of light, and assist in fur- nishing him with new kinds of views; both must then be better understood, more easily consult- ed, less apt to mislead ; and thus becoming much surer guides for refreshing his memory and enliven.

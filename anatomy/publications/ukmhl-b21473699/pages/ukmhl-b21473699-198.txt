Those who tell us that every prominent feature of our character is indicated by some variety of the skull, arising from modifications of the brain, seem neither to reflect on the powerful operation of moral causes, nor on that powerful reaction of organs that so frequently disturbs the functions of the brain, and when long continued, even alters its structure. When physiology is better understood, few will be deceived by such theories and fancies. It will be found equally hostile to the too easy credulity of ignorance, the dogmas of error, and the overweening conceit of the sceptic, who, with an intolerable de- gree of bigotry, frequently talks of established laws, as if all the various secrets of nature were unfolded to him, and he were the confident of the Sovereign of the Universe. But, before Physiology can be carried much farther, farther researches must neces- sarily be made in Comparative Anatomy, where much still remains to be discovered, much to be examined with more accuracy, and much still of the structure and functions of our own bodies to be fur- ther illustrated. If much interested, therefore, in this science, let us not be contented with the reports

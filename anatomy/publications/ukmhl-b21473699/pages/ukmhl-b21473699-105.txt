Hippo- crates had mentioned two membranes enveloping the brain; Aristotle its division into two halvesâ€” a cavity in the middle, and a smaller brain in the back of the head. Herophilus describes, with addi- tional accuracy, all they had seen, and, besides, a variety of other parts which they had overlooked. Yet his more extended knowledge of these organs was nothing to his great discovery of their functions, which justly constitutes one of the eras in the his- tory of anatomy. Instead of the brain, the spinal marrow, and the nerves that issue from them, being mere masses of water and earth for exhaling va- pour, as Aristotle thought, Herophilus demonstrat- ed that they were the organs from which all the rest derive their life, sensation, and motion.

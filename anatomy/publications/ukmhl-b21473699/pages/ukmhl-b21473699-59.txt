LECTURE SECOND. Having taken a distant view of the system, I shall now make a nearer approach, and point out the mode by which we may attain a more accurate inspection. In the Anatomical part of the Course, I intend to demonstrate the several organs, as near- ly in the order in which they have been mention- ed, as the nature of the subject will conveniently permit; at the same time I shall study to explain their different functions, so far as they are known to modern physiologists; and any observations of that kind that cannot with propriety be introduced with the demonstration, shall be reserved for sepa- rate lectures. When the parts are before us,â€”to arrest the at- tention, and to make a more lasting impression on the mind, I shall sometimes mention the time of their discovery, their successive improvements, with the accidents and other circumstances that led to them.

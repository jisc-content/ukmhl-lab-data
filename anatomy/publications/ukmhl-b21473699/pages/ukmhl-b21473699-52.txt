LECTURE FIRST. phatics: they arise from all the internal cavities, commence towards every, part of the surface, and have origins in every organ of the body. In short, they accompany the smaller arteries in the same way as the red veins accompany the larger. They are therefore a subordinate system of veins, destined to return the thin and pellucid portion of the blood which flov/ed in the smaller series of arteries; which arteries might be named the Lymphatic Arteries, and these with propriety the Lymphatic Veins. As the smaller arteries are more numerous than those which carry red-coloured blood, the lymphatics are more numerous than the red veins,â€”are, like these veins, furnished with valves, and, like these veins, carrying their fluids from branches to trunks, they at last terminate in two trunks, which dis- charge their fluids into the trunks of the red veins a little before they enter the right auricle of the heart. Having thus brought the lymphatic fluid, and all the decayed parts of the system, back to the blood, we must now consider in what way we are to dispose of them. It is very evident that these fluids are sent back for one or other of the following pur- poses, either to undergo new preparations to fit them again for those situations which they formerly occu-

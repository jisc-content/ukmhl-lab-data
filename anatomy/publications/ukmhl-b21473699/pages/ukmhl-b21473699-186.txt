It pre- serves alive his former recollections of the human structure, exhibits similar organs and functions, ex- tends his ideas of the animal economy, and occasion- ally corrects the indistinct notions which he had re- ceived from lectures or books. If he be engaged in surgical practice, it makes him familiar with the nature of the parts on which he has to operate, with their connexions, their relative situations, and mu- tual dependence. An artery, a vein, a nerve, and an absorbent, have a similar appearance and similar functions in the warm-blooded quadrupeds that they have in man ; and he who can readily dissect and distinguish them in the one case, can do it in the other; so that he who can with dexterity and skill perform operations on the lower animals, is not ill- prepared to perform the like upon man himself. Some modifications are no doubt requisite, from the difference of circumstances, but a knowledge of these is easily acquired, and may be learned by a person acquainted with the general structure, from verbal descriptions.

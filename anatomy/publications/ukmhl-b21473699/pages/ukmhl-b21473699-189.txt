159 COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. can be more unlike in the other phenomena which they exhibit, than a dead and a living, even though they be of the same species. So let not the young anatomist and surgeon despise this road to professional improvement. They need not be ashamed to tread in the paths where Harvey and Haller, and Cheselden and Hunter have gone be- fore them. Those who neglect such favourable op- portunities to become acquainted with the use of their instruments, are apt, when engaged in any operation, if they cannot contrive some anomalous appearance in the structure, to blame the instru- ments for any unforeseen or untoward circumstance ; but, whatever defects they may point out, the event in general will only serve to remind the by- standers of the common observationâ€”that a bad reaper never yet got a good sickle ; as if the instruments were entirely in the fault, they im- mediately set their invention on the rack to con- trive new ones.

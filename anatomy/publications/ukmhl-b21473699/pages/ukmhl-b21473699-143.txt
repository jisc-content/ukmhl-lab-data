The pupil of Pit- cairu, the celebrated Boerhaave, and the most illus- trious character of his time, from giving his sanc- tion to many of its principles, served to establish them in the schools of physic. The animal system was now considered merely in the light of a mecha- nico-hydraulical machine; and a number of strange theories were formed upon the lentor and fluidity of the humours, the shape, magnitude, and gravity of the particles, and the cavities of the vessels, that were suited to certain forms and magnitudes, which, if they chanced to wander from their course, occa- sioned disease by an error loci. Warmed by enthu- siasm, and blinded by their theories, the mechani- cal physicians could not perceive that most of their conclusions were drawn from hypotheses supported by neither observation nor experiment; and, so eager were they in the application of their favourite science, that they seemed to be offended when any other mode of reasoning was suggested. " Since the hu- man body," said Dr. Friend, " is nothing but a fine contexture of solids and fluids, which observe the rules of mechanism, it is amazing to find that men should think of any other principles than the me- chanical to explain it by." " Would any one," he

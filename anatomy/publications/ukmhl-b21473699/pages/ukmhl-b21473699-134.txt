LECTURE FOURTH. 104 branches of arteries, or that wandered from the course of the circulation, as known to Harvey, and which were not returned by the red veins. Nor was the opinion, that such an absorption was regularly taking place in all parts of the animal body, any new idea in anatomy: it was the general and well- known doctrine of the ancients, as is plainly proved by Kaaw Boerhaave, in his Perspiratio Dicta Hip- pocrati. The office, however, was ascribed to the larger or red veins. But it being obvious that the vessels of Asellius performed the office that had been ascribed to the red veins of the intestines, Rudbeck and Bartholine claimed the same privilege for their lymphatics in all the other parts of the system ; while Vieussenius, a professor at Montpe- lier, endeavoured to show, by mercurial frictions, and from the effects of bathing in water, that very probably many of these vessels opened towards the surface, where many lymphatic arteries terminated. Similar ideas of their nature and functions had oc- curred to Glisson, to Willis, to Hoffman, and to M. Noquez, a French anatomist, who calls them, as early as 1737, Conduits Absorbents, or Absorb- ing Vessels. And the same doctrine has been far- ther confirmed by two very distinguished anato- mists,â€”the late Dr. Hunter of London, and the

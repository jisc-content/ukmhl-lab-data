Aristotle, preceptor to the Prince of Macedon, had, at least by his works, excited a very strong curiosity to investigate the causes of these animal motions. Accordingly, one Lycus of Macedon, a very early writer, Anatomicus Antiquissimus he is called, turned his principal attention to this subject, and at last made the important discovery, that all these motions are performed by the muscles. In a voluminous work on Myology, which he afterwards published, he assigns four muscles to the eye, and though this work was but little known during his lifetime, it, according to Galen, had a wide circu- lation after his death, notwithstanding the deficient cies that might have been expected in a first at- tempt. From having restricted myself in these Lectures, to the leading improvements in anatomy and physi- ology, I cannot return to the disciples of the Alex- andrian school, which, though it produced many distinguished characters in physic and surgery, yet, as their lives are marked by no discoveries in these two branches, I am under the necessity of passing

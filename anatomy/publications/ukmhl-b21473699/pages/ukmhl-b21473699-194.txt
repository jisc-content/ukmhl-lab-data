By observa- tions that were likewise accidental, many have dis- covered that the hair and some other coverings of animals, whether they were natural or artificial, have occasionally emitted electric sparks. By other, merely accidental observations, it has been discover- ed, that some species of animals can discharge strong electrical shocks, and have been found, on research, to contain electric batteries for the purpose.

Who, for instance, could have foreseen, when he was dissecting the limbs of a frog, and surprised at their tremulous motion, that this casual occurrence should immediately have led to the discovery of a

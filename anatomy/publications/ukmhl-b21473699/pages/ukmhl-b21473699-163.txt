LECTURE rOUllTH. 133 K 3 explain the whole functions of the animal system in their own way, would allow no other a share in the merit, but, like one sense trying to perform the duties of the whole, always led to absurd conclu- sions, in which the most patient and stupid credu- lity could hardly acquiesce. These failures should serve as a hint to modern physiologists, that the different functions of the animal system are not to be explained upon the principles of any one science. Nature is not to be dragged into our theories, nor restricted to our rules, and, therefore, if we mean to investigate the truth, we must not assume the tone of authority, and dic- tate to her, but mark her laws, observe her opera- tions, and try to distinguish in what cases she prin- cipally employs her chemical, mechanical, and vital powers. Perhaps she may even employ more than we are aware of. Much is reserved for time and for chance, and much too it is likewise certain we shall never know. For to comprehend whatever relates to the animal system, is to comprehend the Being who made it. Now these hopes we can hardly en- tertain ; for, although we can trace the chain of gra- dation from the meanest reptile, upwards towards man, yet between man and the Sovereign of the Universe, the distance is immense.

LECTURE FOURTH. 119 Black, whose merits as a chemist will perpetuate his memory to latest ages. By this, and other suc- cessive discoveries, chemical analysis has been car- ried to a high state of perfection; and modern che- mistry has already ascertained, in a much more sa- tisfactory manner than was done before, the compo- nent parts of many of the animal solids and fluids ; and farther, having shown, that, in many cases, they vary their proportions according to age, health, and disease, it has furnished us with some new ideas re- specting the changes which regularly take place in the animal economy. But, besides ascertaining the nature of these <ihanges, chemistry has added important information ifespecting two of the principal functions,â€”that of di- gestion, and that of respiration. You will recollect the notions of the ancients with regard to the for- mer, who generally imagined that the food was pre- pared by putrescence or concoction, to which Era- sistratus afterwards added a muscular force.* But neither putrescence, concoction, nor grinding, could ever explain how a variety of different substances are all converted into one kind of fluid, called " Cicero, De Natura Deorum, lib. ii. cap. xxv. gives alter- nate contractions and dilatations to the intestines, for propel- ling the food.

LECTURE FIRST. 21 c 3 some a fluid to nourish the offspring after its birth. But though we have thus nourished the system, by allowing the fluids to escape from the course of the circulation, it may naturally be asked. What have we gained by the explanation ? The difficulty is rather increased than diminished; for, having al- lowed the fluids to escape, to be lodged in bones, ligaments, muscles, and shut cavities, how are we to return them ? How dispose of them ? And by what means, when the body is wasting, shall we carry off" the decayed parts? As these fluids do not accumulate in the healthy state, there must be ne- cessarily some way by which they get out, or some other system of vessels besides veins by which they return to the mass of blood. For the solution of these difficulties, we are chiefly indebted to Rudbeck, a Swede, Bartholine, a Dane, and Jolyffe, an Englishman, who discovered, nearly at the same time, a system of vessels that convey- ed all the decayed parts, and all the thin and pellu- cid fluids that were carried by the smaller series of arteries from the course of circulation, back to the blood. From the clear and watery appearance of the fluid which they contained, they were named Lym-

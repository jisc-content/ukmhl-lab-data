24 LECTUHE FIRST. Having thus seen how these decayed parts are re- moved, and how the system is nourished by the blood, we have next to inquire, how the blood can sustain this loss, and by what channels its supplies are conveyed into the course of circulation. We see the food taken into the mouth, we see it masticated by the teeth, and plentifully mixed with that juice which is called Saliva, and which flows into the mouth from a number of glands in the vicinity. As it moves along, it receives more juice from vessels and other glands in the passage; it arrives soon at a large dilatation of this canal, which is called Stomach; here it meets with ano- ther juice that is named the Gastric: the canal again becomes narrow, and is named Intestine, with many convolutions, and nearly six times the length of the body. Into this portion of the canal glands and vessels likewise continue to pour in their fluids, to lubricate the tube, or assist in the preparation of aliment. Two of these fluids are distinguished by their quantity, by the size of the glands in which they are prepared, and the largeness of the ducts by which they are conveyed. The first of the twoâ€” of a greenish colour and a bitter taste, is named Bile, and secreted in the liver; the second is called the Pancreatic Juice, secreted in a gland that is named the Pancreas.

Portal informs us that something of this kind was employed by Bellini- At last De Graaf, an anatomist of Hollond, contrived conve- nient instruments, and, publishing his account of them in 1664, claimed the whole merit of the dis- covery. What remained now to be sought was a proper injection. Marcellus Malpighi had employ- . ed quicksilver ; and De Graaf mentions only a number of tinctures which all flowed out on the least puncture or rupture of the vessels. His coun- tryman, Swammerdam, saw the defect, employed phone, appeared in 1669. In the same year Mayow's Work appeared at Oxford, where he speaks of having injected the lungs. See Mariget Bibliothec in Mayow. Swammerdam, in Prodromum, p. 38, speaks of his preparation.

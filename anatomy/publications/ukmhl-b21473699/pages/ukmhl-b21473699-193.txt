In his opinion, it was weakness of intellect only, a want of genius, and a despicable in- dolence that could render us content with any thing short of actual experiment and observation. He informs us himself that a common reproach throwp. out against him wasâ€”that he dissected frogs, ser- pents, flies, and other vile animals ; but he adds, that the more he laboured, and the more he was fatigued in these operations, the more pleasure he always re- ceived. I can easily believe that this was the fact* The dissection of a new species of animal must always present many phenomena, and new pljienomena, on re- peated dissections. In this way Comparative Anatomy becomes a source of continued novelty and endless va- riety, and yet he who pursues it,delighted sufficiently ^th observing the varieties that he partly anticipat- ed, may often meet with facts which no analogy could have led him to expect, and which no human in- t^llect could possibly foresep.

The spirit of controversy, which was thus raised, only led to more accurate inquiry. The work of Vesalius remained unrivalled, and at last was successful in dispelling that enchant- ment in which an excessive veneration for Galen had held anatomists for so many ages. In his time, the passage of the blood from the right to the left ventricle of the heart was unknown. Vesalius demonstrated that it could not pass, as had been supposed, through the septum that divides them: anatomists, therefore, were under the neces- sity of looking out for some other way. His pupil, Columbus,* endeavoured to demonstrate, by a pro- cess of reasoning, that it went through the lungs; and something of the kind had also been insinuated by Galen^f and afterwards by Nemesius, bishop of Emessabut was plainly asserted by Vasseur or Vas- seus,aFrenchman,^ andmore plainly still by Servetus, * Columbus De Re Anatomica, lib. xi. cap. 2. -|- The passage of Galen is quoted by Harvey.

LECTURE THIRD. 71 was nearly as imperfect as that of Hippocrates. He imagined that the Wood was principally confined to the veins; that the arteries, besides, contained an aerial spirit, and were the immediate organs of mo- tion ; while the muscles were only organs of sensa- tion. On this hypothesis, the brain and nerves had none of these functions to perform which are now ascribed to them. In his opinion, the brain, there- fore, was a mere mass of water and earth, for exhal- ing vapours, and designed to assist the lungs and the windpipe in regulating the degrees of animal temperature. He believed that the heart was not only the foun- tain of the blood, and origin of the veins, but like- wise the origin of what he calls ntv^x, a term in which he includes the arteries, and sometimes the nerves, ligaments, and tendons. Placing the soul in the left ventricle, from whence it diftiised its in- fluence through the arteries, he makes it also the organ of motion, sensation, and nutrition of the dif- ferent passions, and of the vital flame. He explained respiration, or, more strictly speak ing, the mode in which respiration is performed, by supposing that the heat expanded the air contain- ed in the lungs, and that the external air rushed in to prevent a vacuum.

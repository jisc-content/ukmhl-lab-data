COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. l6l information communicated in lectures upon the Theory and Institutes of Medicine. These lectures being meant to contain the results of all the various observations and experiments relating to the solids, fluids, and functions of the animal structure; but these results, though accompanied sometimes with a few remarks, are rarely accompanied with any de- monstrations ; for not only the pupils, but the lec- turer himself, must often receive them upon bare report, without knowing, in many instances, the motives by which the reporter was actuated, or his qualifications for giving a fair and accurate state- ment. In many cases they are therefore left to form an opinion of structures and functions, not upon evidence weighed and examined, but on sim- ple assertion, without any regular means of ascer- taining whether it was founded on hypothesis or fact. Thus Haller, the most learned of all physiologists, in a case beyond, the reach of his own observations, by trusting the assertion of Sir John Floyer, has maintained that the pulse increases in frequency from the Pole to the Equator, though Sir John, afterwards changing his hypothesis, published a table to shew in what manner its frequency increas- ed through all the intermediate degrees of latitude, from the Equator towards the Pole.

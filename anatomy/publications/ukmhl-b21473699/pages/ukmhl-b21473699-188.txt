By dissecting and prac- tising operations upon them, a knowledge so desir- able, essential and necessary,as a thorough acquaint- ance with the management of the instruments, may be gradually acquired ; and, what is more, such ope- rations, in many respects, may approach nearer to those performed On the living body, than those which are practised on the dead human subject.

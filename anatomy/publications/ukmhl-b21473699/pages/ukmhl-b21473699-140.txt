Galen accounted for a number of diseases, from certain changes in the number, magnitude, figure, situation, the velocity, momentum, and ad- hesion of the parts. And Renatus de Cartes, an eminent philospher and mathematician, biassed by some particular hypothesis, was led to infer, that the lower animals were mere machines. These opinions were well calculated, not only to warrant, but to invite the application of geometry. At an early period, therefore, of modern improve- ment, Fabricius ah Aqua Pendente, partially ap- plied mathematical reasoning to explain the action of some of the muscles. His plan was followed by Steno and others, and at last more successfully ex- ecuted by the ingenious Borelli, in his valuable work De Motu Animalium. Till his time, it was generally believed, that, in muscular action, nature

13 LECTURE FIRST. all the various organs of the body, and when traced to their origin, are regularly found to ter- minate in the brain, or in what is by some reckon- ed its production, the spinal marrow,â€”a substance contained in the cavity of the spine, and which, whether a production of the brain or not, is con- nected with the brain, continued from the brain, conjoined with it in function, and similar in ap- pearance, substance, and texture. The filaments, or ropes, issuing from these, are called Nerves, and are proved, by experiment and ob- servation, to be the primary organs of sense, mo- tion, and feeling. The nerves employed in all those functions that are absolutely necessary to the growth and preservation of the individual, perform their of- fices without our consciousness, while those distri- buted to the different organs by which we procure conveniencies and comforts, are subject to the will: at the same time both classes derive their energy from the vital power, but whether directly, or through the medium of some other substance, is a secret in Anatomy which neither the past nor pre- sent times have been able to disclose.

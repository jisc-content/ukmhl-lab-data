Motion of the 70 distension of the veins here, that it is only very strong pressure that will force the blood beyond the fillet, and cause any of the veins in the upper part of the arm to rise. From these facts it is easy for every careful observer to learn~tHaI the TSIood enters an_extremity by the arteries; Jor__ffihen they are efiectually compressed nothmg is drawn to the member; the hand preserves its colour; nothing flows into it, neither is it distended; but when the pressure is diminished, as it is with the bleeding fillet, it is manifest that the blood is instantly thrown in with force, for then the hand begins to swell; which is as much as to say, that when the arteries pulsate the blood is flowing through them, as it is when the moderately tight ligature is applied; but where they do not pulsate, as when a tight ligature is used, they cease from transmitting anything; they are only dis- tended above the part where the ligature is applied. The veins again being compressed, nothing can flow through them; the certain indication of which is, that below the ligature they are much more tumid than above it, and than they usually appear when there is no bandage upon the arm. It therefore plainly appears that^Jhe ligature prevents the return of the blood through the~vems to the parts above it, jand maintains those beneath it in a state of ^ permanent^distension. 'But the arteries, in spite of its pressure, and under tHelorce and impulse ot the heart, send on the blood from the internal parts of the body to the parts beyond ttie bandage. And herein consists the difference between the tight and the medium bandage, that the former not only prevents the passage of the blood in the veins, but in the arteries also; the latter, however, whilst it does not prevent the pulsific force from extending beyond it, and so propelling the blood to the extremities of the body, compresses the veins, and greatly or altogether impedes the return of the blood through them.

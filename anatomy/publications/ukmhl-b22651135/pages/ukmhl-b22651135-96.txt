62 Motion of the performing amputations, the blood escaped in equal, if not perchance in larger quantity by the veins than by the arteries. The contrary of this statement, indeed, is certainly the truth ; the veins, in fact, collapsing, and being without any propelling power, and further, because of the impediment of the valves, as I shall show immediately, pour out but very little blood; whilst the arteries spout it forth with force abundantly, I impetuously, and as if it were propelled by a syringe. I And then the experiment is easily tried of leaving the ^ vein untouched, and only dividing the artery in the Tieck of a sheep or dog, when it will be seen with what force, in what abundance, and how quickly, the whole blood in the body, of the veins as well as of the arteries, is emptied. But the arteries receive blood from the veins in no other way~than by transmfssTon V through the heartTas we have already seen ; sothat if the aorta be tied at the base of the heart, and the cargtrdur uny uLher artery be opened, no one will now be surprised-to nnd jt empty, and the veins only replete with bloods ' And now the cause is manifest, wherefore in our dissections we usually find so large a quantity of blood in the veins, so little in the arteries ; wherefore there is much in the right ventricle, little in the left; circum- stances which probably led the ancients to believe that the arteries (as their name implies) contained nothing but spirits during the life of an animal. The true cause of the difference is this perhaps : that as there is no passage to the arteries, save through the lungs and heart, when an animal has ceased to breathe and the lungs to move, the blood in the pulmonary artery is prevented from passing into the pulmonary veins, and from thence into the left ventricle of the heart; just as we have already seen the same transit prevented in the embryo, by the want of movement in the lungs and the alternate opening and shutting of their minute orifices and invisible pores. But the

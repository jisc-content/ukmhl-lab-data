In 1630 he consented to accompany the young Duke of Lennox in his travels abroad. He had returned by 1632, for in that year he was formally appointed physician to Charles I. Again, in 1636 he accom- panied the Earl of Arundel on his embassy to the Emperor, and was absent some nine months. Accord- ing to Aubrey, in 1649 Harvey, with his friend Dr. George Ent, again visited Italy. Some doubt has been thrown on this journey, but it receives support from a letter of Harvey's to John Nardi, of Florence, written on November 30, 1653, in which he concludes by asking his correspondent to mention his name to his Serene Highness the Duke of Tuscany, "with thankfulness for the distinguished honour he did me when I was formerly in Florence." In his old age Harvey was honoured in a striking manner by those best fitted to judge of the merit and value of his life's work. His statue was erected in the hall of the College of Physicians. As an acknowledg- ment, as it were, of this remarkable compliment, he built at his own expense a Convocation Hall and a Library as additions to the College, and contributed books, curiosities, and surgical instruments for the Library and Museum. Not content with this, he made over to the College, the year before he died, his paternal estate, stipulating that a certain sum out of it should be employed every year for the delivery of an Oration in commemoration of benefactors of the College, and of those who had added anything ' Evolution: " Encj-clopaedia Britannica,"9th ed. 1878.

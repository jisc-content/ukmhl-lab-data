Circulation of the Blood 123 * Lib. iii, cap. 6. heat comes by the arteries, and is the work of the circulation. It, therefore, appears to me that the learned Riolanus speaks rather expediently than truly, when in his Enchiridion he denies a circulation to certain parts ; it would seem as though he had wished to please the mass, and oppose none; to have written with such a bias rather than rigidly and in behalf of the simple truth. This is also apparent when he would have the blood to make its way into the left ventricle through the septum of the heart, by certain invisible and un- known passages, rather than through those ample and abundantly pervious channels, the pulmonary vessels, furnished with valves, opposing all reflux or regurgita- tion. He informs us that he has elsewhere discussed the reasons of the impossibility or inconvenience of this : I much desire to see his disquisition. It would be extraordinary, indeed, were the aorta and pulmonary artery, with the same dimensions, properties, and structure, not to have the same functions. But it would be more wonderful still were the whole tide of the blood to reach the left ventricle by a set of inscrutable passages of the septum, a tide which, in quantity, must corres- pond, first to the influx from the vena cava into the right side of the heart, and next to the efilux from the left, both of which require such ample conduits. But our author has adduced these matters inconsistently, for he has established the lungs as an emunctory or passage from the heart; ^ and he says : " The lung is affected by the blood which passes through it, the sordes flowing along with the blood." And, again : " The lungs receive injury from distempered and ill- conditioned viscera ; these deliver an impure blood to the heart, which it cannot correct except by multiplied circulations." In the same place, he further proceeds, whilst speaking against Galen of blood-letting in peri- pneumonia and the communication of the veins:

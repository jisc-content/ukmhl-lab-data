Motion of the Heart and Blood 59 .} have found it to hold upwards of two ounces. Let us assume further/jhbw much less lEe "heart will hold ^Ihe-coHtraGted than in the dilated state; and how much blood it will project into the aorta upon each contraction;â€”and all the world allows that with the systole something is always projected, a necessary con- sequence demonstrated in the third chapter, and obvious- from the structure of the valves; and let us suppose as- approaching the truth that the fourth, or fifth, or sixth, or even but the eighth part of its charge is thrown into the artery at each contraction; this would give-et^agg- an ounce, or three drachms, or one drachm of blood as propelled by the heart at each pulse into the aorta; which quantity, by reason of the valves at the root of the vessel, can by no means return into the ventricle, .^w, in the course of half an hour^ the heart _will have made more than one thousand beats, in some- as many as two, three, and even four thousand. Multi- plying the number of drachms propelled by the number ot pulses, we shall have gttljyer one tBWsand. half-ounces^ or one thousand times three drachms, or a like pro- portional quantity of blood, according to the amount which we assume as propelled with each stroke of the heart, sent from this organ into the artery; a larger quantity in^rmiuiWHitue than is contained in the whole Body ! In the same way, m the sheep or dog, say that Bufa single scruple of blood passes with each stroke of the heart, in one half-hour we should have one thousand scruples, or about three pounds and a half of blood injected into the aorta; but the body of neither animal contains above four pounds of blood, a fact which I have myself ascertained in the case of the sheep. Upon this supposition, therefore, assumed merely as- a ground for reasoning, we see the whole mass of blood passing through the heart, from the veins to the arteries,, and in hke manner through the lungs. But let it be said that this does not take place in half an hour, but in an hour, or even in a day ; any way it

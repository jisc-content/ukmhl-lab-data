CHAPTER III 28 OF THE MOTIONS OF ARTERIES, AS SEEN IN THE DISSECTION OF LIVING ANIMALS In connection with the motions of the heart these th ings are further to be observed having reference to the motions and pulses of the arteries : 1. At the moment the heart contracts, and when the breast is struck, when in short the organ is in its state of systole, the arteries are dilated, yield a pulse, and are in the state of diastole. In like manner, when the right ventricle contracts and propels its charge of blood, the arterial vein [the pulmonary artery] is distended at the same time with the other arteries of the body. 2. When the left ventricle ceases to act, to contract, to pulsate, the pulse in the arteries also ceases; further, when this ventricle contracts languidly, the pulse in the arteries is scarcely perceptible. In like manner, the pulse in the right ventricle failing, the pulse in the vena arteriosa [pulmonary artery] ceases also. 3. Further, when an artery is divided or punctured. the_blQod_is seen to belforcibly propelled from the ^^ijund at the moment the left ventricle contracts ;^and, again, when the puliriohary'artery is woun(led,~the blood will be seen spouting forth with violence at the instant when the right ventricle contracts. So also in fishes, if the vessel which leads from the heart to the gills be divided, at the moment when the heart becomes tense and contracted, at the same moment does the blood flow with force from the divided vessel.

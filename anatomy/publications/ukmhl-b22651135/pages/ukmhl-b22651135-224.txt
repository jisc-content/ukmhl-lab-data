Letters blood which is about to enter the right side of the organ, :and that it there ol^tains a further concoction. But what, some one might with as good reason ask, should hinder it from passing into the porta, then into the liver, and thence into the cava, in conformity with the arrange- ment which Aselli and others are said to have found ? IVhy, indeed, should we not as well believe that the ■chyle enters the mouths of the mesenteric veins, and in this way becomes immediately mingled with the blood, -where it might receive digestion and perfection from the heat, and serve for the nutrition of all the parts ? For the heart itself can be accounted of higher import- ance than other parts, can be termed the source of heat and of Hfe, upon no other grounds than as it -contains a larger quantity of blood in its cavities, where, as Aristotle says, the blood is not contained in veins as it is in other parts, but in an ample sinus and cistern, as it were. And that the thing is so in fact, I find an argument in the distribution of innumer- able arteries and veins to the intestines, more than to •any other part of the body, in the same way as the uterus abounds with blood-vessels during the period of pregnancy. For nature never acts inconsiderately. In all the red-blooded animals, consequently, which require [abundant] nourishment, we find a copious distribution •of mesenteric vessels; but lacteal veins we discover in but a few, and even in these not constantly. Where- fore, if we are to judge of the uses of parts as we meet -with them in general and in the greater number of •animals, beyond all doubt those filaments of a white •colour, and very like the fibres of a spider's web, are not instituted for the purpose of transporting nourish- ment, neither is the fluid they contain to be designated by the name of chyle ; the mesenteric vessels are rather •destined to the duty in question. Because, of that -whence an animal is constituted, by that must it neces- sarily grow, and by that consequently be nourished; for the nutritive and augmentative faculties, or nutrition

Motion of the Heart and Blood 65 in arteries filled, or in their natural state, so large a quantity of blood cannot pass in so short a space of time as to make any return necessary;—to all this it may be answered, that from the calculation already made, and the reasons assigned, it appears, that by so much as the heart in its dilated state contains in» addition to its contents in the state of constriction, so- much in a general way must it emit upon each pulsa- tion, and in such quantity must the blood pass, the body being healthy and naturally constituted. But in serpents, and several_fish^j_by tying the veins-. some way below the heartTvou wiU pf^rreive a spacp between the ligature and the heart speedily to become- empty; so that^jinless vou would jden^he-evidence of" your senses, you must needs admit the return of the- blood to the heart. The same thing will also plainly appear~when we come to discuss our second position. Let us here conclude with a single example, con- firming all that has been said, and from which every one may obtain conviction through the testimony of his own eyes. If a live snake be laid open, the heart will be seen puTsatTng" quietly," distinctly, for more than an hour, moving like a worm, contracting in its longitudinal dimensions, (for it is of an oblong shape,) and pro- pelling its contents; becoming of a paler colour in the systole, of a deeper tint in the diastole ; and almost all things else by which I have already said that the truth I contend for is established, only that here everything takes place more slowly, and is more distinct. This point in particular may be observed more clearly than the noon-day sun : the vena cava enters the heart at its lower part, the artery quits it at the superior part; the vein being now seized either with forceps or between the finger and thumb, and the course of the blood for some space below the heart interrupted, you will preceive the part that intervenes between the fingers and the heart almost immediately to become empty, the blood F

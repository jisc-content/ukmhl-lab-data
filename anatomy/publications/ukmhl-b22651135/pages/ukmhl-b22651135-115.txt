Heart and Blood 8i that neither by the eye nor by any other means of examination can the slightest chink along the line of contact be perceived. But if the probe be now introduced from the extreme towards the more central parts, the valves, like the floodgates of a river, give way, and are most readily pushed aside. The effect of this arrangement plainly is to prevent all motion of the blood from the heart and vena cava, whether it be upwards towards the head, or downwards towards the feet, or to either side towards the arms, not a drop can pass; all motion of the blood, beginning in the larger and tending towards the smaller veins, is opposed and resisted by them ; whilst the motion that proceeds from the lesser to end in the larger branches is favoured, or, at all events, a free and open passage is left for it. But that this truth may be made the more apparent, Jet_an arm be tied up above the elbow as if for phlebotomy (a, a, fig. i). At intervals in the course of the veins, especially in labouring people and those whose vems are large, certam knots or elevations (b, c, D, E, f) will be perceived, and this not only at the places where a branch isTeceived (e, f), but also where none enters (c, d) ^these knots or risings are all formed .By valves, which thus show themselves externally. " And now if you press the blood from the space above one of the yate, from h to 6, (fig. 2,) and keep tfTF^omT^ almger upon the vein^ inferiorly, you will see no influx .or5I5o^"from above ; the portion of the vein between the point of the finger and the valve o will be obliterated ; yet will the vessel continue sufficiently distended above that valve (o, g). The blood being thus pressed out, and the vein emptied, if you now apply a finger of the other hand upon the distended part of the vein above the valve o, (fig. 3,) and press downwards, you will find that you cannot force the blood through or beyond the valve; but the greater effort you use, you will only see the portion of vein that is between the finger and the valve beomie more distended, that portion of the vein

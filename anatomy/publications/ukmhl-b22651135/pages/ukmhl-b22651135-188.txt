154 Circulation of the Blood of the vein and coming down from the head, a round torrent of blood gushed forth. You may observe the same fact any day in practising phlebotomy : if with a finger you compress the vein a little below the orifice, the flow of blood is immediately arrested; but the pressure being removed, forthwith the flow returns as before. Froni any lorigjyein of the forearm get_rid_of the blood as much as possible by holding the^hancTaloft and pressing the blood towards the_ trunk, you will perceive the vein collapsed .pgrl. \eavingr, as it were, in a furrow of the skin; but now compress the vein with the point of a finger,^-id you will immediately perceive alt that part of it which is towards the hand, to enlarge and to becomedistended with the blood that is commg from the hand.

Why is it, as Aristotle asks in his problems, that all the actions are more energetically performed when the breath is held than when it is given ? In like manner, when the frontal and lingual veins are incised, the blood is made to flow more freely by compressing the neck and holding the breath.

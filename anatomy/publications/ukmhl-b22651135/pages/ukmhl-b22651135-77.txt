Motion of the Heart and Blood 43: it by a pipe or artery, or[vessel analogous to an artery ; these are facts which are confirmed by simple ocular inspection, as well as by a division of the vessel, when the blood is seen to be projected by each pulsation of the heart. The same thing is also not difficult of demonstration in those animals that have either no more, or, as it were, no more than a single ventricle to the heart, suchs as toads, frogs, serpents, and lizards, which, although they have lungs in a certain sense, as they have a voice, (and I have many observations by me on the admirable- structure of the lungs of these animals, and matters appertaining, which, however, I cannot introduce in this place,) still their anatomy plainly shows that the blood is transferred in them from the veins to the arteries in the same manner as in higher animals,, viz. by the action of the heart; the way, in fact, is- patent, open, manifest; there is no difficulty, no room for hesitating about it; for in them the matter stands precisely as it would in man, were the septum of his heart perforated or removed, or one ventricle made out of two j and this being the case, I imagine that no one: will doubt as to the way by which the blood may pass, from the veins into the arteries. But as there are actually more animals which have- no lungs than there are which be furnished with them, and in like manner a greater number which have only one ventricle than there are which have two, it is open to- ils to conclude, judging from the mass or multitude of living creatures, that for the major part, and generally,, there is an open way by which the blood is transmitted from the veins through the sinuses or cavities of the heart into the arteries. I have, however, cogitating with myself, seen further,, that the same thing obtained most obviously in the of those animals that have lungs ; for in the foetus the four vessels belonging to the heart, viz. the vena cava, the vena arteriosa or pulmonary artery^

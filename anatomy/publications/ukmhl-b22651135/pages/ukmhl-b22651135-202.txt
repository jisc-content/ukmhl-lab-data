168 Circulation of the Blood ' Vide Chapter XI, of the Motion of the Heart, &c. parable to a hot kettle, not because of its proper substance, but because of its contained blood ; for the same reason, because they have numerous veins or vessels containing blood, are the liver, spleen, lungs, &:c., reputed hot parts. And in this way do I view the native or innate heat as the common instrument of every function, the prime cause of the pulse among the rest. This, however, I do not mean to state absolutely, but only propose it by way of thesis. Whatever may be objected to it by good and learned men, without abusive or contemptuous language, I shall be ready to listen toâ€”I shall even be most grateful to any one who will take up and discuss the subject. These, then, are, as it were, the very elements and indications of the passage and circulation of the blood, viz. from the right auricle into the right ventricle ; from the right ventricle by the way of the lungs into the left auricle; thence into the left ventricle and aorta; whence by the arteries at large through the pores or interstices of the tissues into the veins, and by the veins back again with great rapidity to the base of the heart. There is an experiment on the veins by which any one that chooses may convince himself of this truth : Let the arm be bound with a moderately tight bandage, and then, by opening and shutting the hand, make all the veins to swell as much as possible, and the integu- . ments below the fillets to become red; and now let the arm and hand be plunged into very cold water, or snow, until the blood pent up in the veins shall have become cooled down; then let the fillet be undone suddenly, and you will perceive, by the cold blood returning to the heart, with what celerity the current flows, and what an effect it produces when it has reached the heart; so that you will no longer be surprised that some should faint when the fillet is undone after venesection.^ This experiment shows that the veins swell below the .ligature not with attenuated blood, or with blood raised

Motion of the Heart and Blood 79 trunks of the veins; the two—for there are for the most part two together—regard each other, mutually touch, and are so ready to come into contact by their ■edo-es, that if anything attempt to pass from the trunks into the branches of the veins, or from the greater vessels into the less, they completely prevent it; they are farther so arranged, that the horns of those that succeed are opposite the middle of the convexity of those that precede, and so on alternately. The discoverer of these valves did not rightly under- their use, nor have succeeding anatomists added any- thing to our knowledge: for their office is by no means explained when we are told that it is to hinder the blood, by its weight, from all flowing into inferior parts; for the edges of the valves in the jugular veins hang downwards, and are so contrived that they prevent the blood from rising upwards; the valves, in a word, do not invariably look upwards, but always towards the trunks of the veins, invariably towards the seat of the heart. I, and indeed others, have some- times found valves in the emulgent veins, and in those of the mesentery, the edges of which were directed towards the vena cava and vena portse. Let it be added that there are no valves in the arteries [save at their roots], and that dogs, oxen, &c., have invariably valves at the divisions of their crural veins, in the veins that meet towards the top of the os sacrum, and in those branches which come from the haunches, in which no such effect of gravity from the erect position was to be apprehended. Neither are there valves in the jugular veins for the purpose of guarding against apoplexy, as some have said; because in sleep the head is more apt to be influenced by the contents of the carotid arteries. Neither are the valves present, in order that the blood may be retained in the divarica- tions or smaller trunks and minuter branches, and not be suffered to flow entirely into the more open and capacious channels ; for they occur where there are no

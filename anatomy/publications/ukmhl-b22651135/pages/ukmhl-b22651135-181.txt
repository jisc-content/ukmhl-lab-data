Circulation of the Blood 147 clearly see that the part of the vein towards the heart pours out no hloodj whilst that beyond the wound giveg^alorrenf);""^ artery, on the contrary, (as iiTmy'expenrnent on the carotids,) pours out a flood of j2nrP__Mpod frnm the orifice next the heart, and in iets as if it_were forced from a syringe, whilst from the further orifice of the divided artery little or no hlood ggj^pppt;. ■ This experiment therefore plainly proves in what direction the current sets in either order of vessels ■—towards the heart in the veins, from the heart in the arteries; it also shows with what velocity the current moves, not gradually and by drops, but even with violence. And lest any one, by w^ay of subterfuge, should take shelter in the notion of invisible spirits, let the orifice of the divided vessel be plunged under water or oil, when, if there be any air contained in it, the fact will be proclaimed by a succession of visible bubbles. Hornets, wasps, and other insects of the same description plunged in oil, and so suffocated, emit bubbles of air from their tail whilst they are dying; whence it is not improbable that they thus respire when alive; for all animals submerged and drowned, when they finally sink to the bottom and die, emit bubbles of air from the mouth and lungs. It is also demonstrated by the same experiment, that the valves of the veins act with such accuracy, that air blown into them does not penetrate; much less then can blood make its way through them :—it is certain, I say, that neither sensibly nor insensibly, nor gradually and drop by drop, can any blood pass from the heart by the veins. And that no one may seek shelter in asserting that these things are so when nature is disturbed and opposed, but not when she is left to herself and at hberty to act; that the same things do not come to pass m morbid and unusual states as in the healthy and natural condition; they are to be met by saying, that if It were so, if it happened that so much blood

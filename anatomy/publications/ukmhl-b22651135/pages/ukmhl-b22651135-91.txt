Heart and Blood 57 perfection. Here it resumes its due fluidity and receives an infusion of natural heatâ€”powerful, fervid, a kind of treasury of life, and is impregnated with spirits, and it might be said with balsam ; and thence it is again dis- persed ; and all this depends on the motion and action of the heart. The heart, consequently, is the beginning of life; the sun of the microcosm, even as the sun in his turn might well be designated the heart of the world; for it is the heart by whose virtue and pulse the blood is moved, perfected, made apt to nourish, and is preserved from corruption and coagulation; it is the household divinity which, discharging its function, nourishes, cherishes, quickens the whole body, and is indeed the foundation of hfe, the source of all action. But of these things we shall speak more opportunely when we come to specu- late upon the final cause of this motion of the heart. Hence, since the veins are the conduits and vessels that transport the blood, they are of two kinds, the cava and the aorta; and this not by reason of there being two sides of the body, as Aristotle has it, but because of the difference of office; nor yet, as is com- monly said, in consequence of any diversity of structure, for in many animals, as I have said, the vein does not differ from the artery in the thickness of its tunics, but solely in virtue of their several destinies and uses. A vein and an artery, both styled vein by the ancients, and that not undeservedly, as Galen has remarked, because the one, the artery to wit, is the vessel which carries the blood from the heart to the body at large, the other or vein of the present day bringing it back from the general system to the heart; the former is the conduit from, the latter the channel toTTKe heart; the Jatter contains the cruder, effete blood, rendered unfit for nutrition ; the former transmits the digested, perfect, peculiarly nutritive fluid.

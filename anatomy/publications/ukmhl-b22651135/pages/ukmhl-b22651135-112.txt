CHAPTER XIII 78 THE THIRD POSITION IS CONFIRMED : AND THE CIRCU- LATION OF THE BLOOD IS DEMONSTRATED FROM IT Thus far have we spoken of the quantity of blood passing through the heart and the lungs in the centre of the body, and in like manner from the arteries into the veins in the peripheral parts and the body at large. We have yet to explain, however, in what manner the blood finds its way back to the heart from the ex- tremities by the veins, and how and in what way these are the only vessels that convey the blood from the external to the central parts; which done, I conceive that the three fundamental propositions laid down for the circulation of the blood will be so plain, so well established, so obviously true, that they may claim general credence. Now the remaining position will be made sufficiently clear from the valves which are found in the cavities of the veins themselves, from the uses of these, and from experiments cognizable by the senses. The celebrated Hieronymus Fabricius of Aguapen- dente, a mosFskiltul~aliatbmist7 and venerable old man, or, as the learned Riolan will have it, Jacobus Silvius, first gave representations oMhe valves in the veins, which consist of raised or loose portions of the_innjer^ mem'brahes orTKes^vessers. of extreme delicacy, and a sigmoid or semilunar shape. They are situated at ditterent distances from one another, and diversely in different individuals; they are connate at the sides of the veins; they are directed upwards or towards the

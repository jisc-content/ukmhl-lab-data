CHAPTER IV 31 OF THE MOTION OF THE HEART AND ITS AURICLES, AS SEEN IN THE BODIES OF LIVING ANIMALS Besides the motions already spoken of, we have still to consider those that appertain to the auricles. Casper Bauhin and John Riolan,^ most learned men and skilful anatomists, inform us from their observations, that if we carefully watch the movements of the heart in the vivisection of an animal, we shall perceive four motions distinct in time and in place, two of which are proper to the auricles, two to the ventricles. With all deference to such authority I say, that there are four motions distinct in point of place, but not of time; for the two auricles move together, and so also do the two ventricles, in such wise that though the places be four, the times are only two. And this occurs in the fol- lowing manner: There are^_as^it were, two motions going on togeth€x: one of th_e auricles, another of the ventricles • these_by no means taking place simultaneously, but the motiori of the auricles preceding, that of the hearLltself fol- lowing ; the motion appearing to begin from the auricles and to extend to the ventricles. When all things are be- coming languid, and the heart is dying, as also in fishes and the colder blooded animals, there is a short pause be^ tween these two motions, so thatthe heart aroused, as it were, appears to respond to the motion, now more quickly, now more tardily; and at lengthj and when near to ' Bauhin, lib. ii, cap. 21.

Dedication 8 old man from a youth, by a person of understanding from one of inferior capacity. My dear colleagues, I had no purpose to swell this treatise into a large volume by quoting the names and writings of anatomists, or to make a parade of the strength of my memory, the extent of my reading, and the amount of my pains; because I profess both to learn and to teach anatomy, not from books but from dissections; not from the posi- tions of philosophers but from the fabric of nature ; and then because I do not think it right or proper to strive to take from the ancients any honour that is their due, nor yet to dispute with the moderns,, and enter into controversy with those who have excelled in anatomy and been my teachers, I would not charge with wilful falsehood any one who was sincerely anxious for truth, nor lay it to any one's door as a crime that he had fallen into error. I avow myself the partisan of truth alone; and I can indeed say that I have used all my endeavours,, bestowed all my pains on an attempt to produce something that should be agreeable to the good, profitable to the learned, and useful to letters. Farewell, most worthy Doctors, And think kindly of your Anatomist, William Harvey.

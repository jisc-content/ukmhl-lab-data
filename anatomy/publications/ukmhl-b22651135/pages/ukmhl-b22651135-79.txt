Heart and Blood 45 nate in the arteria magna or aorta. In the embryo, consequently, there are, as it were, two aortas, or twa roots of the arteria magna, springing from the heart. This canalis arteriosus shrinks gradually after birth^ and is at length and finally almost entirely withered, and removed, like the umbilical vessels. The canalis arteriosus contains no membrane or valve to direct or impede the flow of the blood in this or in that direction : for at the root of the vena arteriosa, or pulmonary artery, of which the canalis. arteriosus is the continuation in the foetus, there are A thrgg^igmoid or._semilunar valves, which open from' "witmnjoatwards, gjid oppose no obstacle to^ the blood I ^flowing in this direction or from the right ventricle intO' the pulmonary artery and aorta ; but the^" prevent all regurgitation jfom-the aorta^-^r :piib3aQni€--¥es8e'ls^'>-bffek upon the right ventricle ; closing with perfect accuracy^ V they oppose an effectual obstacle to everything of the V kind in the embryo. So that there is also reason to believe that when the heart contracts, the blood is regularly propelled by the canal or passage indicated from the right ventricle into the aorta. What is commonly said in regard to these two great communications, to wit, that they exist for the nutrition of the lungs, is both improbable and inconsistent seeing that in the adult they are closed up, abolished, and consolidated, although the lungs, by reason of their heat and motion, must then be presumed to require a larger supply of nourishment. The same may be said in regard to the assertion that the heart in the embryo does not pulsate, that it neither acts nor moves, so that nature was forced to make these communications for the nutrition of the lungs. This is plainly false; for simple inspection of the incubated egg, and of embryos just taken out of the uterus, shows that the heart moves precisely in them as in adults, and that nature feels no such necessity. I have myself re- peatedly seen these motions, and Aristotle is likewise

8o Motion of the divarications; although it must be owned that they are most frequent at the points where branches join. Neither do they exist for the purpose of rendering the current of blood more slow from the centre of the body; for it seems likely that the blood would be dis- posed to flow with sufficient slowness of its own accord^ as it would have to pass from larger into continually- smaller vessels, being separated from the mass and fountain head, and attaining from warmer into colder places. But the valves are solely made and instituted lest the bloodshould pass from the greater mto the lesser veins^ and either rupture them or cause them to become varicose ; lest, instead of advancing from the extreme to the central parts of the body, the blood should rather proceed along the veins from the centre to the extremities ; but the delicate valves, while they readily open in the right direction, entirely prevent all such contrary motion, being so situated and arranged, that if anything escapes, or is less perfectly obstructed by the cornua of the one above, the fluid passing, as it were, by the chinks between the cornua, it is imme- diately received on the convexity of the one beneath, which is placed transversely with reference to the former, and so is effectually hindered from getting any farther. And this I have frequently experienced in my dis- sections of the veins: if I attempted to pass a probe: from the trunk of the veins into one of the smaller'- 'branches,7whatever^are I took I found it imposidble; to introducejt far any way, by reason of the valves ;; whilst, on~the contrary, it was most easy to puslL-iL:. Lalongjnlhe opposite direction, from without inwards,, oTlronPthe branches towards the trunks and roots.. In many places two valves are so placed and fitted, that when raised they come exactly together in the middle of the vein, and are there united by the contact of their margins; and so accurate is the adaptation,

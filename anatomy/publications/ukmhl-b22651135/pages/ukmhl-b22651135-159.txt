Circulation of the Blood 125 the heart on the one hand, therefore, the blood speedily returns to it again ; another and longer circula- tion proceeding from the left ventricle of the heart performs the circuit of the whole body by the arteries,^ and by the veins returns to the right side of the heart." The learned anatomist might here have added a third and extremely short circulation, viz. from the left to the right ventricle of the heart, with that blood which courses through the coronary arteries and veins, and by their ramifications is distributed to the body, walls, and septum of the heart. " He who admits one circulation," proceeds our author, " cannot repudiate the other ;" and he might, as it appears, have added, " the third." For why should the coronary arteries of the heart pulsate, if it were not to force on the blood by their pulsations ? and why should there be coronary veins, the end and office of all veins being to receive the blood brought by the arteries, were it not to deliver and discharge the blood sent into the substance of the heart? In this consideration let it be remembered that a valve is very commonly found at the orifice of the coronary vein, as our learned author himself admits,^ preventing all ingress, but offering no obstacle to the egress of the blood. It therefore seems that he cannot do otherwise than admit this third circulation, who acknowledges a general circulation through the body, and that the blood also passes through the lungs and the brain.^ Nor, indeed, can he deny a similar circulation to every other part of every other region. The blood flowing in under the influence of the arterial pulse, and returning by the veins, every particle of the body has its circulation. From the words of our learned writer quoted above, consequendy, his opinion may be gathered both of the general circulation, and then of the circulation through the lungs and the several parts of the body; for he who ' Lib. iii, cap. g.

Letters Jieart, so that the greater part of a pound of water was thrown into the right auricle and ventricle. Thej;ejult waSj that the right ventricle and auricle were enornipusly distended, but not a drop of water or of blood made its escape through the orifice in the left ventricle. (The -'ligatures having been undone, the same tube was passed intojhe_pulmonary_artery:,_and a tight ligature having been put round it to prevent any reflux into the right /ventricle, the water^ in the bladder was now pushed / towards tfie~Iungs^ u^on"whTch a torrent_of_the fluid, mixed with a quanTity'of bloo^ifflniediately gushed_forth from the perforation in the lefFventricle ; so~that a "Quantity of water, equal to that which was pressed from the bladder into the lungs at each effort, instantly escaped by the perforation mentioned. You may try this experiment as often as you please ; the result you ■will still find to be as I have stated it. With this one experiment you may easily put an end to all Riolanus's altercations on the matter, to which he, nevertheless, so entirely trusts, that, without adducing so much as a single experiment in support of his views, he has been led to invent a new circulation, and even so far to commit himself as to say that, unless the old doctrine of the circulation ^ be overturned, his own is inadmissible. We may pardon this distinguished individual for not having sooner discovered a hidden truth ; but that he, so well skilled in anatomy as he is, should obstinately contend against a truth illustrated by the clearest light of reason, this surely is argument of his envy—let me not call it by any worse name. But, perhaps, we are still to find an excuse for Riolanus, and to say, that what he has written is not so much of his own motion, as in discharge of the duties of his office, and with a view to stand well with his colleagues. As Dean of the College of Paris, he was bound to see the physic of Galen kept in good repair, and to admit no novelty into the school, without the most careful ' i.e. Harvey's Doctrine.

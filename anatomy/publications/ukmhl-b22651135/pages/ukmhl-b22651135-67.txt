33 Heart and Blood whiteness indicated is most conspicuous towards the extremities or edges of the auricles at the time of their contractions. In fishes and frogs, and other animals which have' hearts with but a single ventricle, and for an auricle have a kind of bladder much distended with blood, at the base of the organ, you may very plainly perceive this bladder contracting first, and the contraction of the heart or ventricle following afterwards. But I think it right to describe what I have observed of an opposite character : the heart of an eel, of several fishes, and even of some [of the higher] animals taken out of the body, beats without auricles; nay, if it be cut in pieces the several parts may still be seen contracting and relaxing; so that in these creatures the body of the heart may be seen pulsating, palpitating, after the cessation of all motion in the auricle. But is not this perchance peculiar to animals more tenacious of life, whose radical moisture is more glutinous, or fat and sluggish, and less readily soluble ? The same faculty indeed appears in the flesh of eels, generally, which even when skinned and embowelled, and cut intO" pieces, are still seen to move. Experimenting with a pigeon upon one occasion, after the heart had wholly ceased to pulsate, and the- auricles too had become motionless, I kept my finger wetted with saliva and warm for a short time upon the heart, and observed, that under the influence of this fomentation it recovered new strength and life, so that both ventricles and auricles pulsated, contracting and relaxing alternately, recalled as it were from death to- life. Besides this, however, I have occasionally observed,, after the heart and even its right auricle had ceased pulsating,—when it was in articulo mortis in short,— that an obscure motion, an undulation or palpitation,, remained in the blood itself, which was contained in the right auricle, this being apparent so long as it was.

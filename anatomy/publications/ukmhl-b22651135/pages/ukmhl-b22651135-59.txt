Motion of the Heart and Blood 25, r— but the same things are manifest in the heart of small fishes and of those colder animals where the organ is more conical or elongated. 3. The heart being grasped in the hand, is felt to become harder during its action. Now this hardness proceeds from tension, precisely as when the forearm is grasped, its tendons are perceived to become tense and resilient when the fingers are moved. 4, It may f^w^^._-b& obseryed in fishes, and the coldeT'^bded animals^ such as frogs, serpents, &c.y that the hear*^ when it moves, becomes of a paler dolour, when qb^^escent of a deeper blood-red colour. ' From these particulars it appeared evident to me that the motion of the heart consists in a certain universal tension—both contraction in the line of its fibres, and constriction in every sense. It becomes erect. hard> and of diminished during its action ; the motion is plainly of the same nature as that of the muscles when they contract in the line of their sinews and fibres ; for the muscles, when in action, acquire vigour and tense- ness, and from soft become hard, prominent, and thickened: in the same manner the heart. We are therefore authorized to conclude that the heart, at the moment of its action, is at once con- stricted on all sides, rendered thicker in itsparietes and smaller in its ventricles, and so made apt to project or expel its charge of blood. This, indeed, is made sufficiently manifest by the fourth observation preceding, in which we have seen that the heart, by squeezing out the blood it contains becomes paler/and then when it sinks into repose and the ventricle is filled anew with jTood, that the deeper crimson colour returns. But no "one need remain m doubt ot the tact, lor it the ventricle be pierced the blood will be seen to be forcibly pro- jected outwards upon each motion or pulsation when the heart is tense. These things, therefore, happen together or at the same instant: the tension of the heart, the pulse of its

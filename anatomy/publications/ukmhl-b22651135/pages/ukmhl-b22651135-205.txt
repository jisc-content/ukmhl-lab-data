Some are of opinion that, as no kind of impulse of the nutritive juices is required in vegetables, but that these are attracted by the parts which require them, and flow in to take the place of what has been lost; so. neither is there any necessity for an impulse in animals, the vegetative faculty in both working alike. But there- is a difference between plants and animals. In animals, a constant supply of warmth is required to cherish the members, to maintain them in life by the vivifying heat,, and to restore parts injured from without. It is not merely nutrition that has to be provided for.

But this is not the place to enter on the consideration of these ; neither may I say under what circumstances and how speedily some of these diseases, that are even reputed incurable, are remedied and dispelled, as if by en- chantment. I shall have much to put forth in my Medical Observations and Pathology, which, so far as. I know, has as yet been observed by no one. That I may afford you still more ample satisfaction, most learned Riolanus, as you do not think there is a circulation in the vessels of the mesentery, I shall conclude by proposing the following experiment: throw a ligature round the porta close to the

Motion of the 52 And shortly afterwards, in the very next chapter, he says : " The more the thorax contracts, the more it strives to force out the blood, the more exactly do these membranes (viz. the sigmoid valves) close up the mouth of the vessel, and suffer nothing to regurgitate.'^ The same fact he has also alluded to in a preceding part of the tenth chapter : " Were there no valves, a three-fold inconvenience would result, so that the blood would then perform this lengthened course in vain ; it would flow inwards during the diastoles of the lungs, and fill all their arteries ; but in the systoles, in the manner of the tide, it would ever and anon, hke the Euripus, flow backwards and forwards by the same way, with a reciprocating motion, which would nowise suit the blood. This, however, may seem a matter of little moment; but if it meantime appear that the- function of respiration suffer, then I think it would be looked upon as no trifle, &c." And, again, and shortly afterwards : " And then a third inconvenience, by no means to be thought lightly of, would follow, were the blood moved backwards during the expirations, had not our Maker instituted those supplementary mem- branes [the sigmoid valves]." Whence, in the eleventh chapter, he concludes: " That they have all a common use, (to wit, the valves,) and that it is to prevent regurgitation or backward motion; each, however, having a proper function, the one set drawing matters from the heart, and preventing their return, the other drawing matters into the heart, and preventing their escape from it. For nature never intended to distress the heart with needless labour, neither to bring aught into the organ which it had been better to have kept away, nor to take from it again aught which it was requisite should be brought. Since, then, there are four orifices in all, two in either ventricle, one of these induces, the other educes." And again he says: "Farther, since there is one vessel, consisting of a, simple tunic, implanted in the heart, and another,

Letters 197 LETTER VII To the distinguished and learned John Dan. Horst, principal Physician at the Court of Hesse-Darmstadt Most excellent Sir,â€”Advanced age, which unfits us for the investigation of novel subtleties, and the mind which inclines to repose after the fatigues of lengthened labours, prevent me from mixing myself up with the investigation of these new and difficult questions: so far am I from courting the office of umpire in this dispute ! I was anxious to do you a pleasure lately, when, in reply to your request, I sent you the substance of what I had formerly written to a Parisian physician as my ideas on the lacteal veins and thoracic ducts.^ Not, indeed, that I was certain of the opinion then delivered, but that I might place these objections such as they were before those who fancy that when they have made a certain progress in discovery all is revealed by them. With reference to your letters in reply, however, and in so far as the collection of milky fluid in the vessels of Aselli is concerned, 1 have not ascribed it to accident, and as if there were not certain assignable causes for its existence; but I have denied that it was found at all times in all animals, as the constant tenor of nutrition would seem to require. Nor is it requisite that a matter, already thin and much diluted, and which is to become fat after the ulterior concoction, should concrete in the dead animal. The instance of pus, I have adduced only incidentally and collaterally. The hinge upon which our whole discussion turns is the assumption that the fluid contained in the lacteal vessels of AselH is chyle. This position I certainly do not think you demonstrate satis- factorily, when you say that chyle must be educed from [' Pecquet deseribed the duct as dividing into two branches, one for each subclavian vein.]

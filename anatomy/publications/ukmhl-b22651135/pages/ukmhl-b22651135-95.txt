Heart and Blood 6i transfused from the veins to the arteries. The actual quantity of blood expelled at each stroke of the heart, and the circumstances under which it is either greater or less than ordinary, I leave for particular determination afterwards, from numerous observations which I have made on the subject. Meantime this much I know, and would here pro- claim to all, that the blood is transfused at one time in larger, at another in smaller quantity; and that the circuit of the blood is accomplished now more rapidly,, now more slowly, according to the temperament, age,, &c., of the individual, to external and internal circum- stances, to naturals and non-naturals,—sleep, rest, food,, exercise, affections of the mind, and the like. But indeed, supposing even the smallest quantity of blood to be passed through the heart and the lungs with, each pulsation, a vastly greater amount would still be- thrown into the arteries and whole body, than could by any possibility be supplied by the food consumed in short it could be furnished in no other way than by making a circuit and returning. This truth, indeed, presents itself obviously before- //' us when we consider what happens in the dissection of / ' living animals; the_great artery need not be divided^ / but a very small branch only, (as Galen even proves in. regard to man,) to have the whole of the blood in the^ ; body, as well that of the veinsjj_ofJhgarteries, drained / ; away in the course of no longtime—some harf-hnnr nr ' less. Butchers are well aware of the fact and can bear witness to it; for, cutting the throat of an ox and so dividing the vessels of the neck, in less than a quarter of an hour they have all the vessels bloodless—the whole mass of blood has escaped. The same thing, also occasionally occurs with great rapidity in per- forming amputations and removing tumours in the human subject. Nor would this argument lose any of its force, did any one say that in killing animals in the shambles, and

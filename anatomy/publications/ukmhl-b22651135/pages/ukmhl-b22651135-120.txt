CHAPTER XV 86 THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD IS FURTHER CONFIRMED BY PROBABLE REASONS It will not be foreign to the subject if I here show further, from certain familiar reasonings, that the circu- lation is matter both of convenience and necessity. In the first place, since death is a corruption which takes place through deficiency of heat,^ and since all Hving things are warm, all dying things cold, there must be a particular seat and fountain, a kind of home and hearth, where the cherisher of nature, the original of the native fire, is stored and preserved; whence heat and life are dispensed to all parts as from a fountain head; whence sustenance may be derived; and upon which concoction and nutrition, and all vegetative energy may depend. Now, that the heart is this place, that the heart is the principle of life, and that all passes in the manner just mentioned, I trust no one will deny. The blood, therefore, required to have motion, and indeed such a motion that it should return again to the heart; for sent to the external parts of the body far from its fountain, as Aristotle says, and without motion, it would become congealed. For we see motion generating and keeping up heat and spirits under all circumstances, and rest allowing them to escape and be dissipated. The blood, therefore, become thick or congealed by the cold of the extreme and outward parts, and robbed of its spirits, just as it is in the dead, it was imperative that from its fount and origin, it should again receive ' Aristoteles De Respiratione, lib. ii et iii: De Part.

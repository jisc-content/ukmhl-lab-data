20 On the Heart and Blood open a way through the pulmonary veins ? I own it has always appeared extraordinary to me that they should have chosen to make, or rather to imagine, a way through the thick, hard, and extremely compact substance of the septum cordis, rather than to take that by the open vas venosum or pulmonary vein, or even through the lax, soft, and spongy substance of the lungs at large. Besides, if the blood could permeate the substance of the septum, or could be imbibed from the ventricles, what use were there for the coronary artery and vein, branches of which proceed to the septum itself, to supply it with nourishment ? And what is especiallv worthy of notice is this : if in the foetus, where everything is more lax and soft, nature saw herself reduced to the necessity of bringing the blood ^fom the right into the left side of the heart by the foramen ovale, from the vena cava through the arteria ~venosa, how should it be likely that in the adult she should pass it so commodiously, and without an effort, through the septum ventriculorum, which has now become denser by age ? Andreas Laurentius,^ resting on the authority of Galen ^ and the experience of Hollerius, asserts and proves that the serum and pus in empyema, absorbed from the cavities of the chest into the pulmonary vein, may be expelled and got rid of with the urine and faeces through the left ventricle of the heart and arteries. He quotes the case of a certain person affected with melancholia, and who suffered from repeated fainting fits, who was relieved from the paroxysms on passing a quantity of turbid, fetid, and acrid urine ; but he died at last, worn out by the disease; and when the body came to be opened after death, no fluid like that he had micturated was discovered either in the bladder or in the kidneys ; but in the left ventricle of the heart and cavity of the thorax plenty of it was met with ; and then ' Lib. ix, cap. xi, quest. 12.

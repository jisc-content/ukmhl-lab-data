Circulation of the Blood 167 and general organ of sensation. But if by the word heart the mere body of the heart, made up of its auricles and ventricles, be understood, then I do not believe that the heart is the fashioner of the blood ; neither do I imagine that the blood has powers, properties, motion^ or heat, as the gift of the heart; lastly, neither do I admit that the cause of the systole and contraction is the same as that of the diastole or dilatation, whether in the arteries, auricles, or ventricles; for I hold that that part of the pulse which is designated the diastole depends on another cause different from the systole, and that it must always and everywhere precede any systole ; I hold that the innate heat is the first cause of dilata- tion, and that the primary dilatation is in the blood itself, after the manner of bodies in a state of fermenta- tion, gradually attenuated and swelling, and that in the blood is this finally extinguished; I assent to Aristode's example of gruel or milk upon the fire, to this extent, that the rising and falling of the blood does not depend upon vapours or exhalations, or spirits, or anything rising in a vaporous or aereal shape, nor upon any external agency, but upon an internal principle under the control of nature. Nor is the heart, as some imagine, anything like a chauffer or fire, or heated kettle, and so the source ot the heat of the blood ; the blood, instead of receiving, rather gives heat to the heart, as it does to all the other parts of the body; for the blood is the hottest element in the body; and it is on this account that the heart is furnished with coronary arteries and veins; it is for the same reason that other parts have vessels, viz. to secure the access of warmth for their due con- servation and stimulation ; so that the warmer any part is, the greater is its supply of blood, or otherwise ; where the blood is in largest quantity, there also is the heat highest. For this reason is the heart, remarkable through its cavities, to be viewed as the laboratory, fountain, and perennial focus of heat, and as com-

112 Circulation of the Blood made of the bodies of persons diseased, worn out by 'Serious and strange affections, how and in what way the internal organs were changed in their situation, ■size, structure, figure, consistency, and other sensible •qualities, from their natural forms and appearances, •such as they are usually described by anatomists; and in what various and remarkable ways they were affected. For even as the dissection of healthy and well-con- stituted bodies contributes essentially to the advance- ment of philosophy and sound physiology, so does the inspection of diseased and cachectic subjects power- fully assist philosophical pathology. And, indeed, the physiological consideration of the things which are according to nature is to be first undertaken by medical men; since that which is in conformity with nature is right, and serves as a rule both to itself and to that which is amiss; by the light it sheds, too, aberrations .and affections against nature are defined; pathology then stands out more clearly; and from pathology the use and art of healing, as well as occasions for the •discovery of many new remedies, are perceived. Nor •could any one readily imagine how extensively internal organs are altered in diseases, especially chronic dis- •eases, and what monstrosities among internal parts these diseases engender. So that 1 venture to say, that the examination of a single body of one who has ■died of tabes or some other disease of long standing, or poisonous nature, is of more service to medicine than the dissection of the bodies of ten men who have been hanged. I would not have it supposed by this that I in any way disapprove of the purpose of Riolanus, that learned and skilful anatomist; on the contrary, I think it deserving of the highest praise, as likely to be ex- tremely useful to medicine, inasmuch as it illustrates the physiological branch of this science; but I have thought that it would scarcely turn out less profitable, to the art of healing, did I place before the eyes of

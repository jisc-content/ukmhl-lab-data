Heart and Blood 93 period when all the parts, like the heart itself in the beginning, are still white, and save in the veins there is no appearance of redness, you shall see nothing in the seat of the liver but a shapeless collection, as it were, of extravasated blood, which you might take for the effects of a contusion or ruptured vein. But in the incubated egg there are, as it were, two umbilical vessels, one from the albumen passing entire through the liver, and going straight to the heart; another from the yelk, ending in the vena portae; for it appears that the chick, in the first instance, is entirely formed and nourished by the white; but by the yelk after it has come to perfection and is excluded from the shell; for this part may still be found in the abdomen of the chick many days after its exclusion^ and is a substitute for the milk to other animals. But these matters will be better spoken of in my observations on the formation of the foetus, where many propositions, the following among the number, will be discussed : Wherefore is this part formed or perfected first, that last ?â€”and of the several members : what part is the cause of another ? And many points- having special reference to the heart, such as : Where- fore does it first acquire consistency, and appear to possess life, motion, sense, before any other part of the body is perfected, as Aristotle says in his third book, De partibus Animalium ? And so also of the blood r Wherefore does it precede all the rest ?

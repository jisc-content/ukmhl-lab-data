84 Motion of the Heart and Blood a way as to compress it, and prevent any blood from passing upwards from the hand; then, with a finger of the other hand, streak the blood in the vein upwards till it has passed the next valve above, (n, fig. 4,) the vessel now remains empty ; but the finger at l being removed for an instant, the vein is immediately filled ' from below; apply the finger again, and having in thÂ£_ same manner streaked the olood upwards, again remove_ tHe~IInger below,_and again the vessel becomes dis- tended as before ; and this repeat, say a thousand times, in a short space of time. And now compute the quantity of blood which you have thus pressed up beyond the valve, and then multiplying the assumed quantity by one thousand, you will find that so much blood has passed through a certain portion of the vesseljand I do now believe that you will find yourself con"vinced ~otthe cifculationjoiflb'^ hInnH, nnd nf its rapid motion. ^' i3ut if in this experiment you say that a violence is done to nature, I do not doubt but that, if you proceed in the same way, only taking as great a length of vein as possible, and merely remark with what rapidity the blood flows upwards, and fills the vessel from below, you will come to the same conclusion.

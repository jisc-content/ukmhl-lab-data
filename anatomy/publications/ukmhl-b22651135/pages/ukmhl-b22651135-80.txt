Motion of the 46 witness of their reality. "The pulse," he observes, "inheres in the very constitution of the heart, and appears from the beginning, as is learned both from the dissection of living animals, and the formation of the <:hick in the egg." ^ But we further observe, that the passages in question are not only pervious up to the period of birth in man, as well as in other animals, as anatomists in general have described them, but for ■several months subsequently, in some indeed for several years, not to say for the whole course of life; as, for •example, in the goose, snipe, and various birds, and many of the smaller animals. And this circumstance dt was, perhaps, that imposed upon Botallus, who thought he had discovered a new passage for the blood from the vena cava into the left ventricle of the heart; and I own that when I met with the same arrangement in one of the larger members of the mouse family, in the adult state, I was myself at first led to something of a like conclusion. From this it will be understood that in the human embryo, and in the embryos of animals in which the •communications are not closed, the same thing happens, / namely, that the heart by its motion propels the blood by obvious and open passages from the vena cava into the aorta through the cavities of both the ventricles; the right one receiving the blood from the auricle, and propelling it by the vena arteriosa, or pulmonary artery, and its continuation, named the ductus arteriosus, into the aorta; the left, in like manner, charged by the contraction of its auricle, which has received its supply through the foramen ovale from the vena cava, con- tracting, and projecting the blood through the root of the aorta into the trunk of that vessel. In embryos, consequently, whilst the lungs are yet in a^fafe of inaction, performing no function, subject to no motion any more than if they had not been present, ^ nature uses the two ventricles of the heart as if they ' Lib. de Spiritu, cap.

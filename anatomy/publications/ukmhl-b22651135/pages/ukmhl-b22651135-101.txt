CHAPTER XI 67 THE SECOND POSITION IS DEMONSTRATED That this may the more clearly appear to every one, ^ have here to cite certain jixpenments^Jm whiclLjl seems obvious that the bloodenters a limb by the. arteries, and returns fronTjt by~ the _vjÂ£uis ; that the arteries are the vessels carrying the blood from the heart, and the veins the returning channels of the blood to the heart; that in the limbs and extreme parts of the body the blood passes either immediately by anastomosis from the arteries into the veins, or mediately by the pores of the flesh, or in both ways, as has already been said in speaking of the passage of the blood through the lungs ; whence it appears mani- fest that in the circuit the blood moves from thence hither, and from hence thither; from the centre to the extremities, to wit; and from the extreme parts back again to the centre. Finally, upon grounds of calcula- tion, with the same elements as before, it will be obvious that the quantity can neither be accounted for by the ingesta, nor yet be held necessary to nutrition. The same thing will also appear in regard to ligatures, and wherefore they are said to draw; though this is neither from the heat, nor the pain, nor the vacuum they occasion, nor indeed from any other cause yet thought of; it will also explain the uses and advantages to be derived from ligatures in medicine, the principle upon which they either suppress or occasion hemor- rhage ; how they induce sloughing and more extensive

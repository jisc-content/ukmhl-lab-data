Editor's Introduction xi when the cruelty of theological dispute sent him to the stake at the age of forty-four, it deprived physiology of a most promising investigator. The book in which the account of the Pulmonary Circulation is found has .a most curious history. All copies of it, except one, were burnt with Servetus. This copy became the pro- perty of D. Colladon, one of his judges. After passing through the library of the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel it came into the hands of a Dr. Mead, who undertook in 1723 to issue a quarto edition of it, but before completion the sheets were seized at the instance of Dr. Gibson, Bishop of London, and destroyed. The Due de Valise is said to have given 400 guineas for the original copy, and at his sale it brought 3,810 livres. It is now in the National Library at Paris. It may well be questioned therefore whether the discovery of Servetus was ever known to the anatomists, including Harvey, who wrote after his death. One of these was Realdus Columbus, who published a work on Anatomy ^ six years after Servetus died, in which he shows that he clearly understood the valves of the heart, and describes the passage of the blood through the lungs. Columbus has been claimed as, the real discoverer of the circulation and as having forestalled Harvey. But neither Servetus nor Columbus had any notion of the Greater or Systemic Circulation. And the latter actually says the heart is not muscular, and speaks of a to-and-fro movement of the blood in the veins. But a third and much more serious precursor of Harvey as the discoverer has been brought forward in the person of Andreas Cassalpinus ^ of Arezzo, justly renowned as the earliest of botanists. He actually used the word " circulation" in regard to the passage of the blood through the lungs. The claims of C^sal- pinus have been taken up with enthusiasm, not to say ' De Re Anatomica, 1559.

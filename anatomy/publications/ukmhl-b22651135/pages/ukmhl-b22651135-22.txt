xviii Editor's Introduction The King, Charles I., not only appointed Harvey his physician, but showed the Hveliest interest in his dis- covery. Harvey explained his new doctrine on the body before the King. Whatever opinions may be held regarding the moral and political character of that unfortunate monarch, it must be admitted that in aiding and befriending Vandyke and Harvey he showed him- self an enlightened patron of both art and science. Harvey continued the King's physician, and held this position when, in 1641, Charles declared war against the Parliament. It is here curious to learn that although openly declared enemies the Parliament was still mindful of the King's person, for not only with their consent, but by their desire, Harvey remained his physician.^ Notwithstanding his intimate connection with the Court, Harvey appears to have taken no active part in the great political struggle now taking place. The little solicitude he had for it is shown by an anecdote told of him at the first battle of the Civil War. " When King Charles," says a contemporary author,^ " by reason of the tumults left London, Harvey attended him, and was at the fight of Edgehill with him : and during the fight the Prince and the Duke of York were committed to his care. He told me that he withdrew with them under a hedge, and tooke out of his pocket a booke and read. But he had not read very long before a bullet of a great gun grazed on the ground near him, which made him remove his station." This anecdote well illustrates Harvey's calm and peaceful character. This was also shown by the restrained and dignified manner in which he treated the many writers who attacked him, some- times in anything but choice language, after the publication of his great discovery. Anything like controversy for controversy's sake was wholly foreign to his nature. "To return evil speaking with evil speaking," he remarks in a reply to one of his critics, ' De Generatione Ex.

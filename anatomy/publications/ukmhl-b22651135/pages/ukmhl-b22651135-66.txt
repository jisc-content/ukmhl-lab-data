Motion of the 32 death, it ceases to respond by its proper motion, but seems, as it were, to nod the head, and is so obscurely moved that it appears rather to give signs of motion to the pulsating auricle, than actually to move. The heart, therefore, ceases to pulsate sooner than the auricles, so that the auricles have been said to outlive it, the left ventricle ceasing to pulsate first of all; then its auricle, next the right ventricle ; and, finally, all the other parts being at rest and dead, as Galen long since observed, the right auricle still continues to beat; life, therefore, appears to linger longest in the right auricle. Whilst the heart is gradually dying, it is sometimes seen to reply;"atter two~orlhree~contractions~of the auricles, rouse"g~as it wefe~Tb~ action, and taking a sjngTe pulsation, sIowIy71jhwinih^1y7¥rid wit^^ an efi^nrtT But this especially is to "be~noted7TKar~after~the heart has ceased to beat, the auricles however still •contracting, a finger placed upon the ventricles per- ■ceives the several pulsations of the auricles, precisely in the same way and for the same reason, as we have said, that the pulses of the ventricles are felt in the arteries, to wit, the distension produced by the jet of blood.

And here I would observe, that whenever I speak of pulsations as occurring in the auricles or ventricles, I mean contractions : first the auricles contract^ and then and subsequently the heart itself contracts. When the auricles contract they are seen to become whiter, •especially where they contain but little blood; but they are filled as magazines or reservoirs of the blood, which is tending spontaneously and, by the motion of the veins, under pressure towards the centre; the

The Will of Harvey 219 which formerly conteined three pages and hath now this fourth page added to it. And I doe now this present Sunday December 28 1656 publish and declare these foure pages whereof the three last are written with my owne hand to be my last will In the presence of Henneage Finch John Raby. This will with the Codicill annexed was proved at London on the second day of May In the yeare of our Lord God one Thousand six hundred fiftie nine before the Judge for probate of wills and granting Adcons lawfully authorised By the oath of Eliab Harvey the Brother and sole executor therein named To whom Administracon of all and singular the goods Chattells and debts of the said deceased was granted and com- mitted He being first sworne truely to administer.^ Chas. Dyneley John Iggulden w. f. gostling Deputy Registers. [' The will of Harvey is without date. But was almost certainly made some time in the course of 1652, He speaks of certain deeds of declara- tion bearing date the loth of July, 1651 ; and he provides money for the completion of the buildings which he has " already beg^n to erect within the Colledge of Physicians." Now these structures were finished in the early part of 1653. The will was, therefore, written between July 1651, and February 1653. The codicil is also undated: but we may presume that it was added shortly before Sunday the 28th of December 1656, the day on which Harvey reads over the whole document and formally declares and publishes it as his last will and testament in the presence of his friend Henneage Finch, and his faithful servant John Raby.]

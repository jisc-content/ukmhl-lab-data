Letters London, 24th April, 1657. 201 illustration. But it is in vain that you apply the spur to urge me, at my present age, not mature merely but declining, to gird myself for any new investigation.

Farewell, most learned sir, and whatever you do, still love Yours, most respectfully, William Harvey.

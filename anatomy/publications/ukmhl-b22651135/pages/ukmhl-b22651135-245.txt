of Thomas Parr 211 memory, however, was greatly impaired, so that he scarcely recollected anything of what had happened to him when he was a young man, nothing of public incidents, or of the kings or nobles who had made a figure, or of the wars or troubles of his earlier life, or of the manners of society, or of the prices of thingsâ€” in a word, of any of the ordinary incidents which men are wont to retain in their memories.

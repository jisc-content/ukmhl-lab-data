Editor's Introduction xiii The view may be ventured that another confusion is responsible for a good deal that has been said about Harvey having been forestalled in the discovery. It is confusing the passage through the lungs of some blood with the whole mass of it. It is difficult to believe, on taking a broaH view of all their statements on the subject, that any of Harvey's predecessors realised that the whole mass of the blood was con- tinually passing through the lungs. Had they done so it is further difficult to see how the systemic circulation should have escaped them. But of this they certainly had no idea. We may admit all this previous knowledge without its detracting from the greatness and merit of Harvey's work. Although the same anatomical facts, and even a glimmering of the Pulmonary Circulation may have been present to the minds of his predecessors or con- temporaries, yet the genius, the spark of originality by which was discovered the proper relation to one another of the former, the true significance and meaning of the latter, belongs to Harvey and to him alone. As was said by one of the best informed minds ^ of the (eighteenth century: "It is not to Cassalpinus, because of some words of doubtful meaning, but to Harvey, the able writer, the laborious contriver of so many experiments, the staid propounder of all the arguments available in his day, that the immortal glory of having discovered the Circulation of the Blood is to be assigned." William Harvey was born on April i, in the year 1578, at Folkestone, the eldest of seven sons of a well-to-do Kentish yeoman. When ten years old he was sent to the Grammar School at Canterbury, and re- mained there until he was fifteen. He then proceeded to Caius College, Cambridge, where after "three years' residence he took the usual degree. Desiring to enter the medical profession, he adopted a course, not ' Haller, Elementa Physiologiae, vol. i. lib. iii., 1757.

Heart and Blood 103 every motion of an animal primarily endowed with a motive spirit (as Aristotle has it/) is contractile; and in what way the word v€vpov is derived from vev'w, nuto, contraho; and how Aristotle was acquainted with the muscles, and did not unadvisedly refer all motion in animals to the nerves, or to the contractile element, and therefore called those little bands in the heart nerves—all this, if I am permitted to proceed in my purpose of making a particular demonstration of the organs of motion in animals from observations in my possession, I trust I shall be able to make sufficiently plain. But that we may go on with the subject we have in hand, viz. the use of the auricles in filling the ventricles : we should expect that the more dense and compact the heart, the thicker its parietes, the stronger and more muscular must be the auricle to force and fill it, and m'ce versa. Now this is actually so : in some the auricle presents itself as a sanguinolent vesicle, as a thin mem- brane containing blood, as in fishes, in which the sac that stands in lieu of the auricle, is of such delicacy and ample capacity, that it seems to be suspended or to float above the heart; in those fishes in which the sac is somewhat more fleshy, as in the carp, barbel, tench, and others, it bears a wonderful and strong resemblance to the lungs. In some men of sturdier frame and stouter make, the right auricle is so strong, and so curiously con- structed within of bands and variously interlacing fibres, that it seems to equal the ventricle of the heart in other subjects; and I must say that I am astonished to find such diversity in this particular in different in- dividuals. It is to be observed, however, that in the foetus the auricles are out of all proportion large, which is because they are present before the heart [the ventricular portion] makes its appearance or suffices for its office even when it has appeared, and they therefore ^ In the book, de Spiritu, and elsewhere.

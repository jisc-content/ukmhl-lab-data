104 Motion of the have, as it were, the duty of the whole heart committed to them, as has already been demonstrated. But what I have observed in the formation of the foetus as before remarked (and Aristotle had already confirmed all in studying the incubated egg,) throws the greatest light and likelihood upon the point. Whilst the fojtus is yet in the guise of a soft worm, or, as is commonly said, in the milk, there is a mere bloody point or pulsating vesicle, a portion apparently of the umbilical vein, dilated at its commencement or base ; by and by, when the outline of the foetus is distinctly indicated, and it begins to have greater bodily consistence, the vesicle in question having become more fleshy and stronger, and changed its position, passes into the auricles, over or upon which the body of the heart begins to sprout, though as yet it apparently performs no duty ; but when the foetus is farther advanced, when the bones can be distinguished from the soft parts, and movements take place, then it has also a heart inter- nately which pulsates, and, as I have said, throws blood by either ventricle from the vena cava into the arteries. Thus nature, ever perfect and divine, doing nothing in vain, has neither given a heart where it was not required, nor produced it before its office had become necessary ; but by the same stages in the development of every animal, passing through the constitutions of all, as I may say (ovum, worm, foetus), it acquires perfection in each. These points will be found else- where confirmed by numerous observations on the formation of the foetus. Finally, it was not without good grounds that Hippo- crates, in his book, " De Corde," intides it a muscle; as its action is the same, so is its function, viz. to con- tract and move something else, in this case, the charge of blood. Farther, as in muscles at large, so can we infer the action and use of the heart from the arrangement of its

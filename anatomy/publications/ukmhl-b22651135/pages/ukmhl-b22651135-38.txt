4 To Prince Charles to compare small things with great. Here, at all events, best of Princes, placed as you are on the pinnacle of human affairs, you may at once con- template the prime mover in the body of man, and the emblem of your own sovereign power. Accept therefore, with your wonted clemency, Ijfmost humbly beseech you, illustrious Prince, this, my new Treatise on the Heart; you, who are yourself the new light â€¢of this age, and indeed its very heart; a Prince abounding in virtue and in grace, and to whom we gladly refer all the blessings which England enjoys, .all the pleasure we have in our lives. Your Majesty's most devoted servant, William Harvey. London, 1628.

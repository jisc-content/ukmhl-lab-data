Heart and Blood 99 the whole body, both ventricles have in fact the same ofifice to perform, whence their equality of constitution. It is only when the lungs come to be used, and it is requisite that the passages indicated should be blocked up, that the differences in point of strength and other things between the two ventricles begin to be apparent: in the altered circumstances the right has only to throw the blood through the lungs, whilst the left has- to impel it through the whole body. There are further within the heart numerous braces,, so to speak, fleshy columns and fibrous bands, which Aristotle, in his third book on Respiration, and: the Parts of Animals, entitles nerves. These are variously extended, and are either distinct or contained, in grooves in the walls and partition, where they occasion numerous pits or depressions. They constitute- a kind of small muscles, which are superadded and supplementary to the heart, assisting it to execute ai more powerful and perfect contraction, and so proving subservient to the complete expulsion of the blood. They are in some sort like the elaborate and artful arrangement of ropes in a ship, bracing the heart on every side as it contracts, and so enabling it more effectually and forcibly to expel the charge of blood from its ventricles. This much is plain, at all events, that some animals have them strongly marked, others have them less so; and, in all that have them, they are more numerous and stronger in the left than in the right ventricle; and whilst some have them in the left, there are yet none present in the right ventricle. In the human subject, again, these fleshy columns and braces are more numerous in the left than in the right ventricle, and they are more abundant in the ventricles than in the auricles; occasionally, indeed, in the auricles there appear to be none present whatsoever. In large, more muscular and hardier bodies, as of countrymen, they are numerous; in more slender frames and in females they are fewer.

30 Motion of the Heart and Blood animals palpitates within their veins, (meaning the arteries,) and by the pulse is sent everywhere simul- taneously." And further,! "thus do all the veins pulsate together and by successive strokes, because they all depend upon the heart; and, as it is always in motion, so are they likewise always moving together, but by successive movements." It is well to observe with Galen, in this place, that the old philosophers called the arteries veins. I happened upon one occasion to have a particular case under my care, which plainly satisfied me of this truth : A certain person was affected with a large pulsatin^tumour on the right side of the neck,^alled an aneurism, just at that part where the artery descends into the axilla, produced by an erosion of the artery itself, and daily increasing in size; this tumour was visibly distended as it received the charge"~dr'brdb9 brought to it by the artery, with each stroke of tlie Keartj the connexion of parts was obvious when the ^Boidy of the patient came to be opened after his death. The pulse in the corresponding arm was small, in con- sequence of the greater portion of the blood being diverted into the tumour and so intercepted. Whence it appears that wherever the motion of the blood through the arteries is impeded, whether it be by compression or infarction, or interception, there do the remote divisions of the arteries beat less forcibly, seeing that the pulse of the arteries is nothing more than the impulse or shock of the blood in these vessels.

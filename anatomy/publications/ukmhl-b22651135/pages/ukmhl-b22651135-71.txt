CHAPTER Y: 37 OF THE MOTION, ACTION, AND OFFICE OF THE HEART From these and other observations of the like kind, I am persuaded it will be found that the motion of the heart is as follows : , First of all, the auricle contracts^ and in the course pflts contraction throws the blood, (which it contains in ample quantity as the head of the vems^ the stofe- "Tiouse. and cistern of the hlooj,) igto^^the ventrick^ which, being filled, the heart raises itself straightway, makes a"ll its fibres tense, conrracts the ventricles, and 'performs a beat, by which beat it immediately sends ^We blood supplied to it by the auricle into the arteries ; the right ventricle sending its charge into the lungs by the vessel which is called vena arteriosa, but which, in structure and function, and all things else, is an artery; the left ventricle sending its charge into the aorta, and through this by the arteries to the body at large. These two motions, one of the ventricles, another of the auricles, take place consecutively, but in such a manner that there is a kind of harmony or rhythm preserved between them, the two concurring in such wise that but one motion is apparent, especially in the warmer blooded animals, in which the movements in question are rapid. Nor is this for any other reason than it is in a piece of machinery, in which, though one wheel gives motion to another, yet all the wheels seem to move simultaneously; or in that mechanical contrivance which is adapted to firearms, where the

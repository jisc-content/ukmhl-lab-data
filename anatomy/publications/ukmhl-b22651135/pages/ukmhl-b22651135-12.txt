Editor's Introduction himself. Their scientific work is therefore of interest, not only for the innate value of the discoveries they made, but also because it shows them as pioneers in that independent spirit of scientific inquiry to which the great advance in natural knowledge since their time is so largely due. Harvey's work, by which his name has been made immortal, strikingly illustrates this. He was the first to show the nature of the movements of the heart, and how the blood moved in the body. He did so by putting on one side authority, and directly appealing to observation and experiment. The completeness of the success with which this independent line was taken, as exemplified in his treatise " On the Movement of the Heart and Blood," is such as to excite the admiration of every modern physiologist. " C'est un chef-d'oeuvre," says a distinguished French physiologist, Flourens, " ce petit livre de cent pages est le plus beau livre de la physiologic." ^ The discovery made by Harvey was this : That the blood passed from the heart into the arteries, thence to the veins, by which it was brought back to the heart again ; that the blood moved more or less in a circle, coming back eventually to the point from which it started. In a phrase, there was a Circulation of the Blood. Moreover, this circulation was of a double nature—one circle being from the right side of the heart to the left through the lungs, hence called the Pulmon- ary or Lesser Circulation; the other from the left side of the heart to the right, through the rest of the body, known as the Systemic or Greater Circulation. Further, that it was the peculiar ofiice of the heart to maintain this circulation by its continuous rhythmic beating as long as life lasts. This appears very plain and simple to us now—so easy that he who runs may read: as important as Flourens, Histoire de la Decouverte de la Circulation du Sang, 1854-

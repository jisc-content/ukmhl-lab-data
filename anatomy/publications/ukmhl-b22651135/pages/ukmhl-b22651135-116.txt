82 Motion of the Heart and Blood which is below the valve remaining all the while empty (h, o, fig. 3). It would therefore appear that the function of the valves in the veins is the same as that of the three sigmoid valves which we find at the commencement of the aorta and pulmonary artery, viz., to prevent all reflux of the blood that is passing over them. ^ Farther, the._arm ^eing bound as before,_and the veins looking full and distended, if you press at one part in the course_of a vein with Uie ^oint of a finger (l, fig. 4), and then with another finger streak the blood upwards beyond thenext valve (n), you will perceive that this portion oTThe vein~continues empty (l n), and that the^ blood cannot retrogade, precisely as we ihave already seen the case to be in fig. 2 ; .but the fencer first applied (h, fig. 2, l, fig. 4), being remomii. linmediatel^the vein is filled from below^ and the arm becomes as it appears at d c, fig. i. That the blood in the veins therefore proceeds from inferior or more remote to superior parts, and towards the heart, moving in these vessels in this and not in the contrary direc- tion, appears most obviously. And although in some places the valves, by not acting with such perfect accuracy, or where there is but a single valve, do not seem totally to prevent the passage of the blood from the centre, still the greater number of them plainly do so ; and then, where things appear contrived more negligently, this is compensated either by the more frequent occurrence or more perfect action of the suc- ceeding valves or in some other way: the veins, in short, as they are the free and open conduits of the blood returning to the heart, so are they effectually prevented from serving as its channels of distribution from the heart. But this other circumstance has to be noted: The arm being bound, and the veins made turgid, and the valves prominent, as before, apply the thumb or finger over a vein in the situation of one of the valves in such

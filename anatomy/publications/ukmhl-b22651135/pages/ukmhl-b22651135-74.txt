40 Motion of the You will reply," he says, " that the effect is so; that ithe blood is prepared in the liver, and is thence 'transferred to the heart to receive its proper form and ilast perfection; a statement which does not appear devoid of reason; for no great and perfect work is •ever accomplished at a single effort, or receives its final polish from one instrument. But if this be actually so, then show us another vessel which draws the absolutely perfect blood from the heart, and distributes it as the arteries do the spirits over the whole body." Here then is a reasonable opinion not allowed, because, forsooth, besides not seeing the true means of transit, he could not discover the vessel which should transmit the blood from the heart to the body at large! But had any one been there in behalf of Erasistratus, ■and of that opinion which we now espouse, and which •Galen himself acknowledges in other respects consonant with reason, to have pointed to the aorta as the vessel which distributes the blood from the heart to the rest of the body, I wonder what would have been the answer of that most ingenious and learned man ? Had 'he said that the artery transmits spirits and not blood, he would indeed sufficiently have answered Erasistratus, •who imagined that the arteries contained nothing but spirits ; but then he would have contradicted himself, and given a foul denial to that for which he had keenly contended in his writings against this very Erasistratus, to wit, that blood in substance is contained in the arteries, and not spirits ; a fact which he demonstrated not only by many powerful arguments, but by ex- (periments. But if the divine Galen will here allow, as in other places he does, " that all the arteries of the body arise from the great artery, and that this takes its origin from the heart; that all these vessels naturally contain .and carry blood; that the three semilunar valves situated at the orifice of the aorta prevent the return .of the blood into the heart, and that nature never

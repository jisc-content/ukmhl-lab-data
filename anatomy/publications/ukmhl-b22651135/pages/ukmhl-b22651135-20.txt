xvi Editor's Introduction on it. This assuredly is a fact almost unique in the history of science. And yet with all this the fact remains that Harvey never really knew, from the nature of the case could not know, how the blood passed from the arteries to the veinsâ€”how, in other words, an essential part of the circulation was actually accomplished. The blood passes from the arteries to the veins through minute microscopic tubes termed capillaries. In Harvey's day the microscope was not sufficiently powerful to reveal such fine structures to human vision, and he was therefore necessarily ignorant of their existence. Looked at from this point of view, the discovery affords a very good example of what has been aptly termed the scientific use of the imagination. Although, with his imperfect microscope, it was im- possible for him to know how the blood actually passed from the arteries to the veins, yet as the result of his observations and experiments he was able to infer and to state the grounds for his inference in clear, forcible, and most convincing language, that the blood must circulate, and circulate in one direction only. viz. from the heart into the arteries, thence to the veins, by which it was brought back to the heart again. His imagination was thus enabled to bridge over the gulf between the arteries and veins which his eyes, with the imperfect instrument then alone at his disposal, were quite unable to cross. It was not until four years after Harvey's death that the microscope had been sufficiently improved to enable an Italian anato- mist named Malpighi,^ in the year 1661, to actually observe the capillaries uniting by their networks arteries and veins. The work was published at Frankfort doubtless that it might be more easily disseminated over the Con- tinent. It made a sensation among the learned of all countries. Its conclusions were opposed by the older ' De Pulmonibus, Observationes Anatomici, 1663.

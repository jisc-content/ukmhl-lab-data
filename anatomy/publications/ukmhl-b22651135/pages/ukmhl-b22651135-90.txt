Motion of the 56 long revolved in my mind, what might be the quantity of blood which was transmitted, in .hDar^^wt a-tirae lis passage migh*-be effected, and the 4ike; and not finding it possible that this could be supplied by the juices of the ingested aliment without the veins on the one hand becoming drained, and the arteries on the â– other'getting ruptured through the excessive charge of blood, unless the blood should somehow find its way from tlh^arteries info ttie vems. and so return to the right side of the heart; I began to think whpi-hpr fhpre. might not be a a motion, it wer^, in a circle. "iMow ttiis 1 afterwards found to be true; and I finally saw that the blood, forced by the action of the left ventricle into the arteries, was distributed to the body at large, and its several parts, in the same manner as it is sent through the lungs, impelled by the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery, and that it then passed through the veins and along the vena cava, and so round to the left ventricle in the manner already in- dicated. "Which motion we may be allowed to call circular, in the same way as Aristotle says that the air and the rain emulate the circular motion of the superior bodies; for the moist earth, warmed by the sun, evapo- rates ; the vapours drawn upwards are condensed, and descending in the form of rain, moisten the earth again ; and by this arrangement are generations of living things produced; and in like manner too are tempests and meteors engendered by the circular motion, and by the approach and recession of the sun. And so, in all likelihood, does it come to pass in the body, through the motion of the blood; the various parts are nourished, cherished, quickened by the warmer, more perfect, vaporous, spirituous, and, as I may say, alimentive blood; which, on the contrary, in contact with these parts becomes cooled, coagulated, and, so to speak, effete; whence it returns to its sovereign the heart, as if to its source, or to the inmost home of the body, there to recover its state of excellence or

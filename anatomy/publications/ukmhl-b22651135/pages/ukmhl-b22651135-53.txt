19 Introduction air, it has the structure of a blood-vessel here. Nature had rather need of annular tubes, such as those of the bronchia, in order that they might always remain open, not have been liable to collapse; and that they might continue entirely free from blood, lest the hquid should interfere with the passage of the air, as it so obviously does when the lungs labour from being either greatly oppressed or loaded in a less degree with phlegm, as they are when the breathing is performed with a sibilous or rattling noise. Still less is that opinion to be tolerated which (as a twofold mattVrV'bne aereal, one sanguineous, is required for the composition of vital spirits,) supposes.the_blQod to ooze through the septum of the heart from the right to tKe^left_yentricle by certain secret pores, and the air to be attracted from the lungs through the great vessel, the pulmonary vein; and which will have it, conse- quently, that there are numerous pores in the septum cordis adapted for the transmission of the blood. But^ in faith, no such pores can be demonstrated,^either in fact do~^ahy such exist. For the septum oTlihe hearT" is of a denser and more compact structure than "any portion of_thp bndv PYf-ppi- thf bpn^s and sinews. But even supposing that there were foramina or pores in this situation, how could one of the ventricles extract anything from the otherâ€”the left, e.g., obtain blood from the right, when we see that both ventricles contract and dilate simultaneously ? Wherefore should we not rather believe that the right took spirits from the left, than that the left obtained blood from the right ventricle, through these foramina ? But it is certainly mysterious and incongruous that blood should be supposed to be most commodiously drawn through a set of obscure or I invisible pores, and air through perfectly open passages, 1 at one and the same moment. And why, I ask, is ! recourse had to secret and invisible porosities, to :; uncertain and obscure channels, to explain the passage ', of the blood into the left ventricle, when there is so

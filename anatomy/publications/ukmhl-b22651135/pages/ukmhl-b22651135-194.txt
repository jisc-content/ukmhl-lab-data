i6o Circulation of the Blood agree with those that are perceived by the senses ; when the things have been thoroughly scrutinized, then are the senses to be trusted rather than the reason." AVhence it is our duty to approve or disapprove, to receive or reject everything only after the most careful examination ; but to examine, to test whether anything have been well or ill advanced, to ascertain whether some falsehood does not lurk under a proposition, it is imperative on us to bring it to the proof of sense, and to admit or reject it on the decision of sense. Whence Plato in his Critias says, that the explanation of those things is not difficult of which w^e can have experience; whilst they are not of apt scientific appre- hension who have no experience. How difficult is it to teach those who have no experience, the things of which they have not any knowledge by their senses ! And how useless and intractable, and unimpregnable to true science are such auditors ! They show the judgment of the blind in regard to colours, of the deaf in reference to concords. Who ever pretended to teach the ebb and flow of the tide, or from a diagram to demonstrate the measure- ments of the angles and the proportions of the sides of a triangle to a blind man, or to one who had never seen the sea nor a diagram ? He who is not conversant with anatomy, inasmuch as he forms no conception of the subject from the evidence of his own eyes, is virtually blind to all that concerns anatomy, and unfit to appreciate what is founded thereon; he knows nothing of that which occupies the attention of the anatomist, nor of the principles inherent in the nature of the things which guide him in his reasonings; facts and inferences as well as their sources are alike unknown to such a one. But no kind of science can possibly flow, save from some pre-existing knowledge of more obvious things; and this is one main reason why our science in regard to the nature of celestial bodies, is so uncertain and

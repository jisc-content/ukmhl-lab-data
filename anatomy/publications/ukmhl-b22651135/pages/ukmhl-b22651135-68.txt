.34 Motion of the ■imbued with heat and spirit. And indeed a circum- •stance of the same kind is extremely manifest in the course of the generation of animals, as may be seen in the course of the first seven days of the incubation of the chick : A drop of blood makes its appearance which palpitates, as Aristotle had already observed; from this, when the growth is further advanced and ■.the chick is fashioned, the auricles of the heart are formed, which pulsating henceforth give constant signs •of life. When at length, and after the lapse of a few days, the outline of the body begins to be distinguished, then is the ventricular part of the heart also produced; vbut it continues for a time white and apparently blood- less, like the rest of the animal; neither does it pulsate • or give signs of motion. I have seen a similar condition of the heart in the human foetus about the beginning of the third month, the heart being then whitish and bloodless, although its auricles contained a considerable quantity of purple blood. In the same way in the egg, when the chick was formed and had increased in size, the heart too increased and acquired ventricles, which ' then began to receive and to transmit blood. And this leads me to remark, that he who inquires very particularly into this matter will not conclude that the heart, as a whole, is the primum vivens, ultimum moriens:—the first part to live, the last to die, but rather its auricles, or the part which corresponds to the '-'auricles in serpents, fishes, &c., which both lives before the heart ^ and dies after it. Nay, has not the blood itself or spirit an obscure palpitation inherent in it, which it has even appeared to me to retain after death ? and it seems very ques- , tionable whether or not we are to say that life begins with the palpitation or beating of the heart. The L seminal fluid of all animals—the prolific spirit, as Aristotle observed, leaves their body with a bound ' [The reader will observe that Harvey, when he speaks of the heart, , always means the ventricles or ventricular portion of the organ.]

Heart and Blood 35 and like a living thing; and nature in death, as Aristotle ^ further remarks, retracing her steps, reverts to whence she had set out, returns at the end of her course to the goal whence she had started; and as animal generation proceeds from that which is not animal, entity from non-entity, so, by a retrograde course, entity, by corruption, is resolved into non-entity; whence that in animals, which was last created, fails first; and that which was first, fails last. I have also observed, that almost all animals have truly a heart, not the larger creatures only, and those ; that have red blood, but the smaller, and [seemingly] j bloodless ones also, such as slugs, snails, scallops, 1 shrimps, crabs, crayfish, and many others ; nay, even f in wasps, hornets, and flies, I have, with the aid of a j magnifying glass, and at the upper part of what is called / the tail, both seen the heart pulsating myself, and shown i it to many others. But in the exsanguine tribes the heart pulsates slug- glishly and deliberately, contracting slowly as in animals that are moribund, a fact that may readily be seen in the snail, whose heart will be found at the bottom of that orifice in the right side of the body which is seen to be opened and shut in the course of respiration, and whence saliva is discharged, the incision being made in the upper aspect of the body, near the part which corresponds to the liver. This, however, is to be observed: that in winter and the colder season, exsanguine animals, such as the snail, show no pulsations ; they seem rather to live after the manner of vegetables, or of those other productions which are therefore designated plant-animals. It is also to be noted that all animals which have a heart, have also auricles, or something analogous to auricles; and further, that wherever the heart has a double ventricle there are always two auricles present, but not otherwise. If you turn to the production of ' De Motu Animal, cap. 8.

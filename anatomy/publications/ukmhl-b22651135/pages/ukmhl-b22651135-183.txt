Circulation of the Blood 149 those who take points for dispute from among them as either not understanding the subject, or as unwilHng to look at things for themselves, and to investigate them with their own senses.^ For my part, I believe that no other kind of attraction can be demonstrated in the living body save that of the nutriment, which gradually and incessantly passes on to supply the waste that takes place in the tissues ; in the same way as the oil rises in the wick of a lamp to be consumed by the flame. Whence I conclude that the primary and common organ of all sensible attraction and impulsion is of the nature of sinew (nervus), or fibre, or muscle, and this to the end that it may be contractile, that contracting it may be shortened, and so either stretch out, draw towards, or propel. But these topics will be better discussed elsewhere, when we speak of the organs of motion in the animal body. To those who repudiate the circulation because they neither see the efficient nor final cause of it, and who exclaim, cui bono ? I have yet to reply, having hitherto taken no note of the ground of objection which they take up. And first I own I am of opinion that our first duty is to inquire whether the thing be or not, before asking wherefore it is ? for from the facts and circum- stances which meet us in the circulation admitted, established, the ends and objects of its institution are especially to be sought. Meantime I would only ask, how many things we admit in physiology, pathology, and therapeutics, the causes of which are unknown to us ? That there are many, no one doubtsâ€”the causes of putrid fevers; of revulsions, of the purgation of excrementitious matters, among the number. _ Whoever, therefore, sets himself in opposition to the circulation, because, if it be acknowledged, he cannot account for a vitiety of medical problems, nor in the treatment of diseases and the administration of '' ' Vide Chapter XIV.

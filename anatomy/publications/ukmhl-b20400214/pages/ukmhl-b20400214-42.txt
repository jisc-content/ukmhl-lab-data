38 well to trace it up as far as possible, as it will probably lead to the posterior deep temporal, which usually arises in common with it. 2. The coronoid process must be sawn off, and the temporal muscle turned up. It is well to lift up and clean the under surface of the temporal muscle before sawing off the coronoid process. In this way the buccal nerve and artery will probably be seen just beneath, and in front of, the anterior border of the muscle; the nerve should lead up to the anterior deep temporal nerve, as the two nerves generally arise by a common trunk,—from which latter, as a rule, there also arises the nerve to the external pterygoid. While turning up the temporal muscle, the deep temporal branches of the internal maxillary artery and inferior maxillary nerve should be traced out. 3. The neck of zJie condyle must be sawn through, and so must also the ramus of the jaw at a point just above the entrance of the inferior dental vessels and nerve into their bony canal. Before sawing the bone, the jaw should be lifted up, and the structures beneath it should be identified & protected from the saw. The dissector should now come upon the two first portions of the internal maxillary artery. But, as the artery may lie deeply between the two pterygoid muscles—instead of lying on the surface of the external pterygoid, and between it and the temporal—the fourth and last of the preliminary operations will now be described, after the performance of which, the dissector will be sure to be upon the artery, if he has not met with it before.

75 THORAX. The thorax being widely opened, as it is our mode of presenting it, first find the two phrenic nerves, the two pneumogastric nerves, and the thoracic duct. The two phrenic nerves will be seen passing down in front of the root of the lung, and by the side of the pericardium. The left pneumogastric will be seen crossing the arch of the aorta, and then getting to the back of the root of the lung. The right pneumogastric is more deeply situated and less easy to find. It must be looked for by the side of the trachea, in the midst of a good deal of loose cellular tissue. It will be seen to pass behind the root of the right lung. The thoracic duct should be looked for and secured before anything has been disturbed in the lower part of the thorax. Turning the right lung over to the left of the middle line, the vena azygos will be seen passing up on the right side of the bodies of the vertebrae. The thoracic duct will be found running up between this and the aorta. It lies in a little loose cellular tissue in fro?it of the right intercostal arteries. It has the appearance of a small vein. Trace the two phrenic nerves in front of the root of the lung, and by the side of the pericardium.

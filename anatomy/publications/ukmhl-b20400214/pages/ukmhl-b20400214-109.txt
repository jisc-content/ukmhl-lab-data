107 Trace the superficial perinasal vessels & nerve very carefully forwards, bearing in mind that they not unfrequently perforate the transversus perinsei muscle. Clean the transverse perinseal vessels. Now place the body in the lithotomy position, and dissect the perinasum proper. The superficial, or thick and fatty layer, and the deep, or thin and laminated layer, of the superficial fascia of the perinaeum will easily be made out, - the deep layer binding down the two prominent, and apparently large muscles of the region, the accelerator urinoe and the erector penis. The transversus perinsei has barely been referred to up to the present, but it has not been forgotten. It may have been seen through the fascia when the fibres of the sphincter ani were traced forwards towards the central tendinous point of the perina3um5 or when the superficial perineal vessels & nerves were traced forwards from the ischio-rectal fossa, or when the transverse perinseal vessels were traced inwards behind the position the muscle should occupy. If it has not yet been perceived, it is probably very small. In this case, remove, on one side, the deep layer of the superficial fascia of the perinaeum from off two muscles above named, and carefully reflect it backwards. This will expose what may exist of the transversus perinsei.

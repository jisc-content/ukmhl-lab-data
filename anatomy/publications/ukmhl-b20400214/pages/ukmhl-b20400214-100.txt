98 fatty tissue. They cannot usually be seen at once, but they can be felt by pressing the finger on the bone in the situa- tions named. Flexing the limb slightly, so as to relax the muscles, the dissector should now pass his finger beneath these both in the upper & in the lower part of the popliteal space, and thus isolate the vasculo-nervous bundle in front and at sides. Little more need be said here. Following out the general principles which he has frequently applied before, the dissector will have no difficulty in cleaning the several structures, and then in removing the mass of fat in which they lie. The superior internal articular artery should be traced beneath the tendon of the adductor magnus. The azygos articular artery will be found arising from the front of the popliteal, and piercing the posterior ligament of the knee-joint, The three insertions of the semi-membranosus. Tendon of biceps splitting to embrace long external lateral ligament of knee-joint. All the structures in the popliteal space being cleaned, and the fat removed, the posterior surface of the femur, where it forms the floor of the popliteal space, should be scraped clean with the handle of a forceps.

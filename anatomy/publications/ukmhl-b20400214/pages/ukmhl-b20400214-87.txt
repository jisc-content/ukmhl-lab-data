83 The crura of the diaphragm, more particularly their tendi- nous portion, can now be got at on either side ; they should be thoroughly cleaned with the aorta which lies between them. 6. The position of the inferior phrenic arteries should now be made out by feeling for them as they cross the fleshy portion of the crura of the diaphragm just above the cceliac axis. As soon as they are traced out, the subjacent fleshy portion of the crura, and the fibrous arch which unites the crura, can be cleaned without difficulty. Every difficulty worth speaking of in connection with the deep dissection of the abdomen is now got over, The branches of the lumbar plexus will easily be found upon the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles. As regards the parts at the brim of the pelvis, all that is wanted is a little care in clean- ing the large arterial and venous trunks. The deep epigastric arteries require just a little attention as they pass upwards and inwards along the lower and inner boundaries of the internal abdominal ring, and are hooked round by vas deferens in the male, and by the round ligament in the female. The ligamenta arcuata can best be got out on the left side.

39 4. The condyle of the jaw must be disarticulated, and thrown forwards with the inter articular fibro-eartilage and the external pterygoid muscle. By looking at the base of the skull the dissector will see that behind and internal to the glenoid fossa and condyle, there lie from behind forwards and inwards, the Grlaserian fissure, the .foramen spinosum, and the foramen ovale, towards or from which pass respectively the tympanic artery & the chorda tympani, the middle meningeal artery, and the inferior max- illary and small petrosal nerves and small meningeal artery. These structures lie, therefore, behind & internal to the capsule of the joint, and the dissector will see the importance of deal- ing with much care with the latter. It is a tough, fibrous structure, which must be removed piecemeal. The dissector has now reached the centre of the region. The internal maxillary artery will lie prominently before him,â€”either on the surface of the external pterygoid, or beneath it. Its inferior dental branch descends on the surface of the internal pterygoid ; and here will be seen, beneath and behind this branch, the inferior dental nerve, and beneath and in front of it, the gustatory. Beneath the two nerves is the internal lateral ligament of the jaw. The internal maxillary artery may now be cleaned freely, except along its superior aspect, as it is from this aspect that there should arise, from behind forwards, first the tympanic artery, then the middle, and then the small meningeal.

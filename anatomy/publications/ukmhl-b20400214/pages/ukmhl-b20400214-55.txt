51 rectus, and superior oblique muscles; and trace the nasal nerve and ophthalmic artery forwards & inwards above the optic nerve to the superior internal angle of the orbit, and clean their branches. The lenticular ganglion and ciliary nerves can now be got out from above ; but it is preferable to dissect these structures from the outer side. ( Vide below.) The middle dissection may now be transformed into a deep dissection. To make a Deep Dissection of the orbit, divide the optic nerve, turn the eyeball forwards, and trace the sixth nerve to the inner surface of the external rectus, and the lower division of the third nerve to the internal & inferior recti and inferior oblique.* TEANSFOEMING A SUPEEFICIAL DISSECTION OF THE OEBIT INTO A DISSECTION FEOM THE OUTEE SIDE; LENTICULAR GANGLION. Separate the soft parts from the outer wall of the orbit, and, with bone pliers, divide the malar bone into the spheno- maxillary fissure. Eemove the back part of the outer wall of the orbit. Divide the external rectus, and reflect it with the sixth nerve. * For the purposes of either of these two dissections, or of the dissection from the outer side, the eyeball should be injected with wax.

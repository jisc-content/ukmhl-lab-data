14 it directly, would probably have been cut through, to the injury of the deeper structures. The undivided part of the fascia has led to the slips to the toes; these have led to the four soft pads or cushions, which, in their turn, have led to the digital nerves and arteries.â€”"De fil en aiguille" Again, let us glance briefly at the popliteal space. What a crowd of superficial structures stand here in the way of the deeper ones ! Small sciatic nerve and external or short saphenous vein, with the two branches of origin of the external saphenous nerve ; then, beneath the fascia, the sural arteries & veins, and the nerves to the heads of the gastrocnemius & plantaris ; how they impede the dissection of trunk artery, vein, & nerves! Can we wonder at the dissector missing the articular arteries ? Is there a way of rendering the dissection, at least relatively, easy? Dissect wide of the popliteal space itself, clean and lift up the inner head of the gastrocnemius on the one hand, and the outer head on the other. Beneath them you will find the inferior internal articular artery running downwards & inwards upon the tibia, and the inferior external articular passing horizontally outwards above the head of the fibula. Deal similarly with the muscles bounding the space superiorly, the biceps on the one hand, the semi-tendinosus & -membra- nosus on the other; and the superior internal & superior external articular arteries, if they are not seen at once, can at least be felt upon the femur in the midst of the bed of fat in which they lie. Then, from beneath the raised muscles, the trunk artery, vein, & nerves can be reached, and thoroughly cleared and isolated with the finger. The dissection of the space is now half completed.

16 The dissection of the upper part of the anterior triangle of the neck (parotid region) is another similar instance. Where the carotid artery and its later branches dip into the parotid gland, the student finds the deeper dissection hampered by the great auricular nerve & external jugular vein, which, with us at least, he is taught to preserve ; by Steno's duct—to him a some- thing sui generis which he has a difficulty in identifying; and by the branches of the facial nerve, so beautifully, but so per- plexingly, depicted in plates. Here again, after spending much time in vain efforts, the student once more finds himself stopped in his work. It suffices, I have always found, to put him on the trunk of the facial nerve, as already explained, showing him how its radiating branches cross the trunk of the carotid and its later branches, so that he can trace out the nerves in the parotid gland without injuring the arteries, to start the dis- sector once more " on his way rejoicing." III. Every art has its more or less precise rules, which, if excellence is to be attained, must be carefully applied from the very first. We would lay down four cardinal rules for the dissector :— • 1. The dissector should most carefully study his part, BEFORE BEGINNING TO DISSECT IT. He should study it on plates; he should study it in the museums he has access to,— on the model dissections always left out for study in our anatomical school; he should study it on the dissections of others. The contrast cannot be too sharply accentuated between the dissector who earnestly studies his part first and dissects it afterwards, and he who dissects it first and reads about it

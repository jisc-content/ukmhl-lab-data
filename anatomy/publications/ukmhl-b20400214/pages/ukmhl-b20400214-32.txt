28 In cleaning these structures all the vena? coniites should be removed,â€”the internal jugular vein, and the external jugular, already met with, being of course preserved. The vena comitcs pass in front of the corresponding arterial trunks. The structures requiring most care are the ascending pharyngeal artery, the branch of the hypoglossal nerve to the thyro-hyoid muscle, and the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. The ascending pharyngeal artery arises in the angle of separation between the internal and external carotids, and passes up, in front of, and internal to, the former. The nerve to the thyro-hyoid arises from the lower border of the hypoglossal as the latter crosses the facial artery just below the posterior belly of the digastric and stylo-hyoid. The external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is best looked for as it gets beneath the upper part of the sterno-thyroid muscle. It runs just behind the oblique line on the ala of the thyroid cartilage on the surface of the inferior constrictor of the pharynx, and thus reaches the crico-thyroid muscle. It can now be traced upwards to the main trunk, which it joins much higher up than is figured in Hirschfeldt's plates. The dissection is generally very much neglected both at the lower part and at the upper part of the anterior triangle of the neck.

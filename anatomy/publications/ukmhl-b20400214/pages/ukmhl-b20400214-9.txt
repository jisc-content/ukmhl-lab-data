PREFACE. This is a book of methods, not a systematic treatise. Hence various omissions: things believed to be familiar to the average dissector have been left out. Hence, again, the supplementary character common to the < Guides ' and to the 6 Tablets.' The methods submitted are based upon a careful study of the several parts of the body from the dissectors point of view. They have been slowly elaborated by daily dissections extending over many long years. They aim at enabling the dissector to make the best and most lasting use of each part he dissects. It will be noticed that the dissections are so planned as to allow the dissector to get clown to the bones and ligaments without removing the superficial structures^ - all structures, both superficial and deep, being thus preserved for after-study.

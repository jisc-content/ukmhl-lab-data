Clean the arch of the aorta and the upper part of the thoracic aorta; and turn the arch of the aorta over to the left, so as to get behind it. Trace the left recurrent laryngeal nerve beneath, and then behind, the arch of the aorta, and in the groove between the trachea and the oesophagus. It passes on the left side of the ductus arteriosus.* Find the upper part of the thoracic duct on the left side of the oesophagus, and behind the left subclavian artery. It lies behind and to the left of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. It should be traced carefully from below. Lift up well what remains of the sternum (in our way of opening the thorax) by means of a hook reflected over a block, and clean the innominate, left common carotid, and left subclavian arteries, being mindful of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and of the thoracic duct. Clean the trachea, and the commencement of the bronchi. * The ductus arteriosus greatly interferes with the cleaning of all the deeper structures at the upper part of the thorax, and more particularly of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, thoracic duct, oesophagus, trachea, and the root of the left lung. It is, however, an important landmark, which must not be done away with. If carefully ligatured in two or three places, both near its pulmonary extremity and near its aortic extremity, with fine strong twine, it may be divided between the ligatures, and, when the dissection of the above-named structures is completed, the two halves of the duct may be tied together. For the ligatures to hold, it is necessary that they be such as are above described, and that they be applied before the duct is divided. In tying together the two halves of the divided duct, the dissector will of course be careful to so tie them that they lie on the right side of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve.

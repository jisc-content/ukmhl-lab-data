94 III. GLUTEAL REGION. The authors very distinct experience of average dissec- tions of the gluteal region is that, in addition to the liability common to most parts to be left unfinished, this has a liability of its own to get damaged. It presents many pitfalls to the inexperienced dissector. Though there is a distinct plane of loose fascia beneath the gluteus maximus, the dissector, in dividing the muscle, is much exposed to injure some of the parts beneath. Then there is the temporary indistinctness— till the fascia is removed—and the somewhat complex felting, of these subjacent structures. And they radiate also in many different directions from the great sacro-sciatic foramen, thus:— Upzvards & backwards, superficial branches of the gluteal artery; forwards, and forwards & upwards, deep branches of the gluteal artery and superior gluteal nerve; dozvnzvards^ sciatic vessels & nerves; downwards & inzuards, pudic vessels & nerve, and nerve to the obturator internus, also inferior pudendal branch of the small sciatic. The detailed instructions below given may be summed up in two general instructions : Kaise the gluteus maximus with care, especially with regard to the small sciatic and inferior pudendal nerves; having raised it, define directly the great sacro-sciatic foramen by thoroughly exposing the great sacro-sciatic ligament. Clean the gluteus maximus down to its lowest fascicle, and raise the latter with care, looking for the small sciatic nerve and its inferior pudendal branch ; these lie between the tuber ischii & the great trochanter, nearer by a little to the former. Find the upper edge of the gluteus maximus, and separate

33 middle line of the bridge of the nose. It may be got out first, as it will lead conveniently both to the anterior belly of the occipito- frontalis and to the orbicularis. While exposing it, tense it by drawing up the skin of the forehead in the middle line. While cleaning the anterior belly of the occipito-frontalis, draw the whole width of the scalp backwards. Just to the outer side of the pyramidalis are the innermost fibres of the orbicularis, which are nearly parallel to it, and easily made out, moreover, by their arising from the tendo oculi and from the adjoining part of the internal angular process of the frontal bone & nasal process of the superior maxilla. Where the anterior belly of the occipito-frontalis is inserted into the orbicularis, carefully define the edge of the latter. Now clean the lower and inner part of the orbicularis. Here its fibres are first nearly parallel to, and then diverge slowly from, the fibres of the levator labii superioris alseque nasi, which is internal to it, and can thus easily be defined. More externally, the circumference of the muscle is free, and merely overlaps the levator proprius labii superioris, and sometimes the zygo- matic!, a distinct cellular interval intervening. This portion of the orbicularis should be well lifted up from off the subjacent muscles. . Now take in the main the second stratum of muscles.

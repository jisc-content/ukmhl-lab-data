30 thyroid axis. It takes a tortuous course upwards & inwards behind the vasculo-nervous bundle of the neck. Trace out its ascending cervical branch. The removal of a little cellular tissue will now expose the vertebral artery as it passes up between the scalenus anticus & longus colli, and enters the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra. The internal mammary & superior intercostal arteries, and inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and the relations of the first part of the subclavian artery — structures which properly belong to the thorax—can easily be made out at the same time as the above. UPPER PART OF THE ANTERIOR TRIANGLE. The trunk of the facial nerve being found as already explained (see p. 12),* its temporo- and cervico-facial branches should be traced through the parotid, and the anastomoses made out between the former & the auriculo-temporal, and between the latter and the great auricular. The external carotid, with its posterior auricular & temporal branches, and the commencement of the internal maxillary can now be cleaned. To find the auriculo-temporal nerve, dissect close to the posterior border and under surface of the neck of the condyle. The nerve will then be seen as a large trunk (about the size of * For another way of rinding the trunk of the facial nerve, see Addendum, p. 118. .

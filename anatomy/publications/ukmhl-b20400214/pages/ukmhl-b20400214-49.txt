45 From above, three dissections should be madeâ€”the super- ficial dissection, which should be taken in conjunction with the dissection of the parts in the cavernous sinus; the middle dissection; and the deep dissection. These dissections will show the structures of the orbit as they are generally seen, and will be the most useful. The dissection from the outer side supplies, however, a better view of the lenticular ganglion. This dissection should be preceded by a dissection from above, not taken further than the superficial stage. MODE OF OPENING THE ORBIT. Saw skull-cap close to superciliary ridge. Find the outer extremity of the sphenoidal fissure by intro- ducing a knife into it with the blade turned outwards. Saw the roof of the orbit from a little internal to the external angular process of the frontal to the outer extremity of sphenoidal fissure ; posteriorly, this section should be made with a Hey's saw. Saw the roof of the orbit from a little external to internal angular process to the middle of the anterior clinoid process, the outer part of this process being removed with the roof of the orbit; posteriorly, this section should be made with Hey's saw. Complete saw-cuts with a sharp chisel. A tap with a hammer on the supra-orbital arch will loosen the piece of bone, which must then be tilted forwards. SUPERFICIAL DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT FROM ABOVE, AND DISSECTION OF THE PARTS IN THE OUTER WALL OF THE CAVERNOUS SINUS. This dissection, usually considered a particularly difficult

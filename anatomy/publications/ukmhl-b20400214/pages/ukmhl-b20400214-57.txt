53 VII. SUB-OCCIPATAL REGION—SCALENI MUSCLES, AND DEEP MUSCLES OF THE FRONT OF THE NECK. Tense the trapezius either by flexing the neck, or, better, by forcibly rotating the part so that the face looks over ihe shoulder of the side being dissected. This can easily be done with the callipers. Tense and clean first one trapezius and then the other. The fascia over the upper part of the trapezius is extremely dense. Be care- ful, therefore, of the thin outer edge of the muscle, which is easily missed. The great occipital nerve pierces the trapezius quite at its upper part, just below its insertion into the superior curved line of the occipital bone, and is not easy to find in the dense fascia referred to. But by relaxing the muscle, and raising its edge, the nerve may b°. seen beneath ir, piercing the complexus ; and can then easily be traced through the trapezius and on to the back of the head. Reflect both trapezii inwards, dividing them transversely on a level with the superior angle of the scapula. Clean on both sides the splenius and the levator anguli scapulae, and such portion of the complexus as is exposed. The fibres of the two former muscles are oblique upwards & outwards; those of the complexus are vertical. Remove, on one side, the splenius, levator anguli scapulae, parts of the rhomboideus & serratus posticus superior, and the complexus. In the subjacent mass of loose fat, feel for the prominent

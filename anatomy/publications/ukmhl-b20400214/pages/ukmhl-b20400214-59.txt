55 The ganglion on the posterior root of the second cervical nerve is as large as a small pea, and cannot be missed if properly looked for. The scaleni muscles and the deep muscles of the front of the neck are left attached when the section of the pharynx is made. These can now be cleaned. VIII. PHARYNX AND SOFT PALATE. The section of the pharynx (quod vide) to be made after the dissection of the triangles of the neck, face, pterygo- and sub-maxillary regions.* (The orbit & sub-occipital region can be dissected either before or after the section.) If a good pharynx is to be obtained, special attention must have been paid, in dissecting the face, to the orbicularis oris & buccinator, and, in dissecting the deeper parts of the neck, to the stylo-glossus & -pharyngeus muscles and glosso- pharyngeal nerve. The digastric & stylo-hyoid muscles should be preserved, as they constitute valuable supports to the pharynx when dissected. Pharynx to be well and evenly distended with small balls of tow introduced both through the mouth and through the oesophagus; lips to be stitched together. Clean the buccinator as far backwards as you can beneath the masseter, removing the " bottle graissettse de Bichat; " cut away the masseter. Remove the deep temporal fascia and the temporal muscle, tearing the muscle away from beneath the zygoma. * If the above dissections are good ones, it seems preferable to preserve them, and to give a fresh " part " for the pharynx and soft palate

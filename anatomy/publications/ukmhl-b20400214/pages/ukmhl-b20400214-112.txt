110 The inner boundary, the more distinct of the two lateral boundaries, especially in its lower half, should now be traced upwards and outwards as it passes up behind the femoral sheath to become attached to the ilio-pectineal line. The outer boundary is far less distinct, except in strong muscular subjects. It must be traced with great care upwards and inwards in front of the femoral sheath towards the anterior superior spine of the pubes, to which it is attached. In tracing it, the knife should scarcely be used. The saphenous opening being made out, no real difficulty presents with reference to the femoral sheath and canal. The three compartments of the sheath can be opened by vertical incisions without interfering with the saphenous opening. Any division of the fascia lata intended to facilitate access to the deeper structures would greatly damage the part for future study. When there happens to be a lymphatic gland in the femoral canal, the dissection of this compartment of the sheath is of course facilitated. For the dissection from behind, see page 113. (B.) COVERINGS OF THE TESTICLE; TESTICLE, EPIDIDYMIS, & SPERMATIC CORD. One single incision from the external abdominal ring to the bottom of the scrotum is all that is required to demonstrate

70 Posterior carpal arch; termination of anterior interosseous artery. Find the terminal portion of the posterior interosseous nerve beneath the extensores indicis & communis digitorum, and trace it upwards with the posterior interosseous artery. Thoroughly separate the extensor muscles up to the outer condyle, clean the anconeus & supinator brevis, and trace the interosseus recurrent artery beneath them (see page 68). V. PARTS ABOUT SHOULDER. Clean the deltoid, and make out the bursa beneath it. The arm being abducted, it is quite unnecessary to divide the muscle. Carefully separate the teres minor from the infra-spinatus, teres major, and long head of the triceps, so as to open up the triangular and quadrilateral spaces; and complete the cleaning of the dorsalis scapulse artery, and of the posterior circumflex artery and circumflex nerve. On the branch of the latter to the teres minor a small ganglion should be found. It is sometimes difficult to separate the teres minor & infra-spinatus. It is towards their insertion into the humerus, where they become tendinous, and the interval between them is greatest, that it is easiest to separate them.

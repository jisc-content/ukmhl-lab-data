5*2 Find the lower division of the third nerve. It is a large nerve running downwards & forwards to the internal & inferior recti and inferior oblique. From its back part a short thick trunk, about an eighth of an inch long, will be seen running upwards & forwards to the ganglion. This is the short or motor root of the ganglion. By carefully drawing the ganglion forwards, or by pulling carefully upon one of the ciliary nerves, a delicate filament about a quarter of an inch long will be seen to run forwards and slightly downwards from the nasal nerve to the ganglion. This is the long or sensory root. The ganglion with the two roots above named, and the ciliary nerves, lie in extremely loose cellular tissue, and are quite easily cleaned. The dissector is usually recommended to look for the lenticular ganglion by tracing one of the ciliary nerves backwards. In the writer's opinion, the way above described is much the better. It is somewhat more difficult, however, to make out the sympathetic root, which is often blended with the long or sensory root. Of the four dissections of the orbit, the only one at all difficult is the superficial dissection from above; the others are quite easy. When, therefore, a dissector has got a good superficial dissection of the orbit from above, he is strongly recommended not to hastily transform it either into a middle dissection, or into a dissection from the outer side. Neither should a middle dissection be inconsiderately transformed into a deep one. Students co-operating a little in the matter of orbits, there will always be previous external and deep dissections, and probably some middle dissections, whose authors, B. & C. & D., will be glad to study the superficial dissection of A., while A. can benefit by studying their more advanced work betore conducting his own dissection through its final stages.

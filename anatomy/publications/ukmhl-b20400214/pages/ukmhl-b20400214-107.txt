105 I. PERITONEUM & ISCHIO RECTAL REGION. It is by no means difficult to show the prominent features of the perinseum & ischio-rectal region, provided the trans- versa perinsei muscle be well developed; but this muscle is extremely variable, and not unfrequently so small as to be almost unrecognisable. The whole of the superficial dissection should be so planned, therefore, as to make the dissector sure of finding such representative of the muscle as may be present. The two regions should be taken together; it adds materially to the difficulty of the dissection to take them separately. It is a mistake, also, to place the body, to begin with, in the lithotomy position, - this position not being the most con- venient for exposing the inferior pudendal nerve, or the back part of the sphincter and levator ani, coccygeus, and pudic vessels & nerve. To find the inferior pudendal nerve,, place the body on the abdomen at the end of the table, and let the legs hang down. Then make an incision from a little behind the tip of the coccyx towards a point two inches below the great trochanter, and thoroughly expose the lower edge of the gluteus maximus. The nerve will be found emerging from 8

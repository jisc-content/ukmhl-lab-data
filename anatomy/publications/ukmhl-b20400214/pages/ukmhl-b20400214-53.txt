49 calls the " dangerous point." Behind this point the ophthalmic nerve was inferior and external, not only to the third nerve, but also to the fourth nerve. Here the ophthalmic nerve gets somewhat above the third nerve, preparatory to two of its branches entering the orbit above the muscles. It is therefore from the under surface of the ophthalmic that the nasal nerve is given off. It is with great care, therefore, that the ophthalmic nerve is to be lifted up and cleaned on its under surf ace. It is with great care, also, that the third nerve is to be dissected forwards in the vicinity of the " dangerous point," until the ophthalmic nerve has been made out. Careless cleaning of the third nerve would lead to cutting the ophthalmic; careless cleaning of the under surface of the ophthalmic might isolate the nasal nerve; and, through the density of the fibrous tissue of the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, this nerve would then probably adhere to the third nerve, and appear to be a branch of the latter. The author has noticed this appearance more than once. The reader will now see the ratio7iale of the following resume:— RESUME OF SUPERFICIAL DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT, AND PARTS IN THE OUTER WALL OF THE CAVERiSOUS SINUS. Fourth nerve dissected backzvards,—forwards for a short distance, if found in the free edge of the tentorium. Lachrymal nerve dissected backwards in the loose cellular tissue of the orbit, but not further; not traced to its origin from the ophthalmic.

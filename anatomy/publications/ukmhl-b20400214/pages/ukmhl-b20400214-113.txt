Ill the coverings of the testicle & spermatic cord. This incision should be deepened a short distance below the external abdominal ring till the dark and closely-set fibres of the cremaster muscle are distinctly seen (lower down, these fibres are paler and much more scattered). The dissection can then be completed with the finger: the skin, what there is of the superficial fascia, and the dartos will easily peel off; and the deeper coverings and visceral structures will shell out. JNotice the gradual transition from the superficial fascia of the surrounding regions to the dartos; examine the septum scroti and the several successive coverings ; open up the tunica vaginalis. Eemove the coverings from off the spermatic cord, separate its component parts, and isolate more particularly the thick and cord-like vas deferens, which lies at the back. Trace the vas deferens downwards along the lower two-thirds of the posterior border of the testicle internally to the epididymis. Try to find the vas aberrans. (C.) INGUINAL HERNIA. (DISSECTION FROM THE FRONT.) Carefully preserve the thin intercolumnar fascia as it passes down from the external abdominal ring upon the funicular portion of the cord. The ring should not be opened. Notice the intercolumnar fibres, with which the intercolumnar

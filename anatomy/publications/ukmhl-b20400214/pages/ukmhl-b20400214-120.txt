lis ADDENDUM. There is another way of coming upon the trunk of the facial nerve, which the* less venturesome dissector may perhaps prefer to the one given on page 12. While the temporo-facial branch of the facial nerve crosses in the parotid both the arterial & the venous trunk, the cervico-facial branch crosses the arterial trunk only, and passes beneath the corresponding vein. Hence the dissector may trace up into the parotid both the external jugular vein, and its large anterior branch of origin, - the internal maxillary, - not only without danger to the facial nerve, but with the certainty of finding the cervico-facial branch of the nerve close to, and just beneath, the vein. The cervico-facial branch, once found, will soon lead up to the parent trunk. The dissector must of course be careful not to trace the posterior branch of origin of the external jugular vein, - the temporal vein, - till after the temporo- cervical branch has been found ; otherwise this would necessarily be divided.

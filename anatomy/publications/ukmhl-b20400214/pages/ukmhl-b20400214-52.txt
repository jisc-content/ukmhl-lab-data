48 & Inferior Maxillary Nerves.—The stratum of dura mater is easily removed, which forms the roof of the canal traversed by the fifth nerve; but further on the dissection of the ganglion & the three nerves it gives off is more difficult, on account of the softness of the ganglion and the nerves, and the density of the tissue in which these structures he. It Avill help the dissector to note that the foramen & canal traversed by the fifth nerve are formed by the splitting of the dura mater into two layers, of which one passes above, and the other underneath, the nerve, further on, over the ganglion and the three primary branches it gives off, these two layers unite,—the same bundles of fibres, or the continuation of the same bundles, passing respectively above and underneath ganglion & nerves, so that the ganglion & nerves will be laid bare if the same thickness of dura mater be removed from off them as was removed from off the trunk of the fifth nerve. The dissection of the nerves will further be facilitated by the dissector having a base of the skull before him, and first making out roughly the position of the foramina ovale & rotundum on his " part," and then feeling for them with a probe. The inferior maxillary nerve should be thoroughly cleaned as it traverses the foramen ovale, so that, when the pterygo- maxillary region is dissected, a probe may be passed through the foramen ovale, by the side of the nerve, in order that the latter may the more easily be found outside the cranium. 4. "Dangerous Point.'- There is considerable difficulty— though a very different kind of difficulty from that met with in cleaning the fourth & lachrymal nerves—in making out the origin of the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, and its relation to the upper & lower divisions of the third nerve. The third and ophthalmic nerves converge and meet, or nearly meet, in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus at a point just external to the anterior clinoid process. This point is what the author

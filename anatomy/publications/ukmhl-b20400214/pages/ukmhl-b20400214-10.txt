6 As a book of methods, this is necessarily built up some- what on the lines of the 6 Handbook of the Physiological Laboratory.5 In physiology, we have been benefiting greatly for now some twenty years by the extension of practical work initiated by the authors of the above remarkable treatise. No corresponding progress has, however, been made in anatomy. Admirable as are the works of Ellis, Heath, & Holden, they cannot be considered to correspond, in anatomy, to, in physiology, the 6 Handbook.' They profess, in fact, to combine two things, - descriptions of the structures exposed, and rules for exposing them, - the latter being necessarily brief, and more or less overshadowed by the more voluminous descrip- tive element. The immediate object of the present opuscule is to dis- sociate the two elements hitherto combined, with a view to giving the dissector that help which he requires in the dis- secting-room more fully than has hitherto been done, - as fully, indeed, it is hoped, as may be consistent with individual effort on the part of the learner. The kind of anatomy aimed at in these pages, - and, indeed, though less visibly so, in the author's other publications, - is that thorough practical acquaintance with the human body, which is comparable to everyone's knowledge of the locality in which he lives, - comparable, indeed, to the young gutter urchin's know- ledge of the yards, alleys, lamp-posts, door-steps, knockers, and key-holes of the narrow precincts in which his lot is cast, - to whom the very paving stones are familiar, which he treads with his naked feet.

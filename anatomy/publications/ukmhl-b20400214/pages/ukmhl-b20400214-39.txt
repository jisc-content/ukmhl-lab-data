35 the intervals between the radii they represent, to make out the deeper muscles. The levator anguli oris arises from the upper jaw below the opening of the infra-orbital foramen, and is therefore crossed by the infra-orbital vessels & nerves. The buccinator will, of course, be made out without difficulty, and will be seen to dip externally beneath the masseter, a little in front of which it is perforated by Steno's duct. The depressor labii inferioris is closely adherent to the skin, and is distinguished from the depressor anguli oris, from beneath which it emerges, mainly by the direction of its fibres, which pass upwards and inwards, while those of the more superficial muscle pass upwards and outwards. The above muscles being made out, there come finally the corrugator supercilii, the tensor tarsi, the depressor abe nasi, and depressor labii inferioris. By dividing some of the inner fibres of the anterior belly of the occipito-frontalis, and turning up the upper & inner portion of the orbicularis, the corrugator supercilii will be seen arising from the inner extremity of the superciliary ridge, and passing outwards to be inserted into the under surface of the orbicularis. The tensor tarsi must be sought for after the deep dissection

anterior wall of Hunter's canal (which lower part should be preserved), and passing between sartorius and gracilis. Freeing the upper border of the adductor magnus (the thigh being flexed and adducted) will expose the obturator externus muscle and the inner & outer branches of the obturator artery. But these parts can only be cleaned to advantage (unless the superficial structures be sacrificed, which is undesirable) after the dissection of the gluteal region, when they can be reached partly from the front and partly from the back. IT. FRONT OF LEG AND DORSUM OF FOOT. The dissection of the front of the leg is in itself quite easy, but it should be so planned as to facilitate as much as possible the more difficult and somewhat tedious dissection of the dorsum of the foot. On the dorsum of the foot we have an extremely complex felting of somewhat uninteresting structures. (1.) The venous arch, which opens, on the one hand, into the internal saphenous vein, and, on the other hand, into the external saphenous, crosses more or less transversely the terminations of the internal & external saphenous nerves and the radiating branches of the musculocutaneous. (2.) The branches of this latter nerve cross the long extensor tendons in a direction forwards & inwards. (3.) The long extensor tendons cross the tendons of the extensor brevis in a direction forwards & outwards. (4.) The tendons of the extensor brevis cross the external branches of the dorsalis pedis artery and the external branch of the anterior tibial nerve more or less at right angles ; while

Clean the outer surface of the lower jaw in front of the masseter by detaching therefrom the platysma, the depressores anguli oris & labii inferioris, and the mucous membrane of the mouth. Clean also the inner surface of the lower jaw from the level of the masseter & internal pterygoid to that of the anterior belly of the digastric, carrying the knife close to the bone. This will divide the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth and the origin of the mylo-hyoid. If a nice-looking dissection is to be obtained, the mylo-hyoid muscle should be detached from its bony origin with considerable care; otherwise its fibres will separate, and its upper edge will get to look ragged. Scissors are the best instrument to use. Saw the jaw-bone in front of the masseter & internal pterygoid, and just external to the insertion of the anterior belly of the digastric ; and remove, but keep, the detached piece of bone. The tip of the tongue should now be drawn upwards and forwards while the hyoid bone is drawn downwards. This will tense the hyo-glossus muscle. Turn down the mylo-hyoid. This will expose the deep portion of the submaxillary gland, the parts on the surface of the hyo-glossus, the genio-hyo-glossus, and the genio-hyoid. Parts on surface of hyo-glossus from belozv upivards:â€” Hypoglossal nerve; submaxillary gland with Wharton's duct;

to divide the internal and external anterior thoracic nerves near where they enter the pectoral muscles. Preserving them makes it difficult to clean the upper part of axillary vessels and nerves. Clean well the branches of the axillary artery, including the anterior circumflex, removing all the corresponding venae comites,—not the axillary vein, nor the basilic. The anterior circumflex artery is a small branch, which passes outwards beneath the biceps and coraco-brachialis in front of the tendon of the latissimus dorsi. At the back part of the axilla, clean the nerve of Bell, or posterior or long thoracic, the three subscapular nerves, and the subscapular artery with its dorsalis scapulae branch. It is no easy matter to thoroughly clean the vasculo-nervous bundle, and the deeper parts of the axilla. The finger introduced beneath the vasculo-nervous bundle from the outer side—between the bundle & the thick upper part of the costo-coracoid membrane—affords very considerable help. The bundle being thus lifted up (see foot-note, p. 19), not only ought the trunks to be cleaned— each one separately and all round—with relative ease, but the subscapular artery and the three subscapular nerves ought without much difficulty to be taken to their respective terminations. Separate well the latissimus dorsi, teres major, subscapu- laris, and long head of the triceps, and open up the triangular and quadrilateral spaces between them ; but the cleaning of the dorsalis scapulae artery and of the circumflex nerve and posterior circumflex artery can only well be completed from behind when the parts about the shoulder are dissected. At the lower part of the arm trace out the inferior pro- funda and anastomotica magna arteries as they perforate the

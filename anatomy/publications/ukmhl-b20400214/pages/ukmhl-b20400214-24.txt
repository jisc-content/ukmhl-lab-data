20 IV. It cannot be too strongly impressed upon the dissector that a dissection should be worked at steadily every day till it is completed. A dissection once completed, and of which all the structures are well cleaned, will keep nice for months. Not so with a part which is left unfinished. This spoils more rapidly than the inexperienced would easily believe, and it can never be made attractive. All structures that are nearly bared should be cleaned thoroughly before work is left off for the day. While a thick layer of fat or fascia left over a structure will preserve it for a time from drying, and keep it fresh, a thin layer, especially of laminated cellular tissue not containing much fat, will, on the contrary, dry up with the structure, and become so thoroughly incorporated with it, that it can never properly be removed. Even the plan of moistening the part will not help much in the case of small structures which have once been allowed to dry; besides which, wetting a part washes out the colour of the muscles, and first whitens and then darkens the connective tissues, so that distinctions of structure previously quite plain are ^ effaced, and the work rendered much more difficult and uncertain. Parts should be dissected while fresh, if good work is to be done. Dissection is twice as easy then as it is later on. Brief and unexplained references will be noticed here and there to " clamps," "hooks reflected over blocks," "callipers," &c. It seemed difficult, in a book intended primarily for the guidance of dissectors at the School of Anatomy, &c, to avoid all mention of appliances in constant use in the Author's dissecting- room ; neither did it seem worthy of the general subject dealt with to refer more fully to small mechanical devices, however useful in their way.

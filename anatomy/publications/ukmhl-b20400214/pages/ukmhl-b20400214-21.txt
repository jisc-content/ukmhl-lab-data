17 afterwards. The former, while he is dissecting, knows what he is to look for; where things are, what they look like, how they run ; where he is on safe ground and can cut freely, where he may do damage and must be cautious. He is planning his operations so as to make the most of his opportunity. He is doing work both enjoyable and of the highest possible order. The best descriptions are but imperfect embodiments of scientific truth : our worthy friend is critically examining and checking such as his teachers have placed before him, and he is laying the foundation of that individual acquaintance with things which lies at the base of all true knowledge. The other dissector, on the contrary, is blindly bungling through his work, laboriously cleaning, perhaps, a muscular artery because it chances to be large, and removing a ganglion with its roots because, being small, it fails to catch his untrained eye. When he sets to read, he finds that many things of interest have been cut away from his part, and that he has himself greatly restricted his opportunity of learning. 2. A point to which the dissector should pay great atten- tion from the very first refers to the cleaning of all arteries, veins, and nerves. These " long organs " (as, in fact, all the organs of the body) lie in a sheath of connective tissue, which is but slightly adherent to them. Why this is, will be easily understood. It is a general rule that, wherever there is pressure or friction, there the cellular tissue becomes laminated and free from fatâ€”i.e., aponeurotic or semi-aponeurotic. It is this condensed layer (more or less condensed according to circumstances) that constitutes the sheath of either artery, vein, or nerve. Let the dissector get his knife within the

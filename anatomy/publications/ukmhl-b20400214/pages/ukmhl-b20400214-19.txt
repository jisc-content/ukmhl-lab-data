15 Examples could be multiplied almost ad infinitum. The " De fil en aiguille" principle is the best guide to the dissector when looking for the smaller structures. It is the best guide for the demonstrator when helping the student out of his difficulties with his "part." I have always noticed that there are certain stages in the dissection of almost every part of the body, at which the average dissector is stopped by difficulties which he is unable to over- come, unless a little help be given him. The deep dissection of Scarpa's triangle is a case in point. The dissector has got out fairly, we will say, femoral artery & vein and anterior crural nerve, with the beginnings, but little more than the beginnings, of their principal branches. But now he is uncertain how to proceed. He does not know how to follow out the branches. He tries one, and finds he cannot get on far with it because there is something in the way. He tries another, with the same result. After doing his best for a time, he gives up the effort, and leaves the part unfinished. I am sure that everyone who has spent, if only a few weeks, in a dissecting room, will be familiar with the case here depicted. To give this dissector a fresh start, all that I have usually found necessary is to show him that he must first thoroughly free and lift up the branches of the anterior crural nerve in order to get fairly at the external circumflex artery; and that he must then separate the adductor muscles, so as to get upon the profunda artery with its internal circumflex & perforating branches, and upon the obturator nerve & vessels

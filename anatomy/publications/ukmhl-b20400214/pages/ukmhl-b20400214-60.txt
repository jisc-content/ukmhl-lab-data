56 If a fresh part has been taken for the dissection of the pharynx, saw off the coronoid process; also disarticulate the condyle of the lower jaw, and remove it with the external pterygoid, sawing the neck of the bone. Carefully remove the internal pterygoid. Make out the pterygo-maxillary ligament in the line of junction of the buccinator and superior constrictor of the pharynx. Clean the tensor palati. Now proceed to clean the constrictors of the pharynx and the stylo-pharyngeus, working from below upwards. Preserve the insertions of the omo- and sterno-hyoid and -thyroid and the thyro-hyoid, and the superior & recurrent laryngeal nerves. When the upper border of the superior constrictor has been reached, remove the mucous membrane and fibrous bag of the pharynx, defining the upper border of the superior constrictor and the cranio-pharyngeal ligament, and clean the levator palati muscle. The pharynx being opened in the middle line, and the palato- pharyngeus being tensed by drawing the thyroid cartilage downwards, remove the mucous membrane from off this muscle,

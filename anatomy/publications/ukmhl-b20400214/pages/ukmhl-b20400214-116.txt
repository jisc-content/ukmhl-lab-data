114 obturator artery, particularly note its course with reference to the femoral ring and GKmbernat's ligament. Clean the fascia transversalis; define the internal abdominal ring; note how the fascia transversalis descends into the inguinal canal to form the infundibuliform fascia and the fascia propria. Note the sudden divergence of the elements of the sper- matic cord; - how the vas deferens (or the round ligament) winds round the deep epigastric artery to descend into the pelvis; how the spermatic vessels & nerves ascend towards the upper part of the abdomen. Clean the posterior aspect of Poupart's and Gimbernat's ligaments, the sharp edge of which latter should be quite familiar to the surgeon, and define the femoral ring. Clean the external iliac artery & vein, and note how the fascia trans- versalis passes beneath Poupart's ligament into the thigh to form the anterior wall of the femoral sheath and canal; and how the iliac fascia passes down behind the femoral vessels to form the posterior wall of the same.

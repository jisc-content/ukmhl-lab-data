93 lies on the outer side of the popliteal space close to the tendon of the biceps. When the above have been found, the external or short saphenous nerve will be traced without difficulty. Divide anterior annular ligament. Trace extensor tendons to bases of second and third phalanges. Internal and external malleolar arteries* Terminal portion of anterior peroneal artery, perforating lower part of interosseous membrane. Lift up extensor brevis digitorum, and trace out branches of dorsalis pedis artery & outer branch of anterior tibial nerve- Clean internal and external lateral ligaments of ankle-joint. At the upper part of the leg, the recurrent tibial artery should be carefully cleaned as it runs upwards & inwards in the substance of the tibialis anticus ; to this effect the tibialis anticus and the extensor longus digitorum should first be separated up to their origin from the head of the tibia. The large oval opening through which the anterior tibial artery passes from the back to front of the limb, should also be care- fully made out; but this should be left till the popliteal space and back of the leg have been dissected, as the foramen can then be got at from the back as well as from the front. * These arteries should be looked for with care, but not before the anterior annular ligament has been divided and the four muscles of the front of the leg have been raised. They vary a great deal in size, especially the inner one, which is often so small that it would probably pass unnoticed were not the dissector's attention directed to it.

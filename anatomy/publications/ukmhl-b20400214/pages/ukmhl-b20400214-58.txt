54 spinous process of the axis. Towards it there converge from below the upper fibres of the multifidus spinae, and from it there diverge superiorly the inferior oblique and the rectus capitis posticus major. Beneath the latter muscle is the rectus capitis posticus minor. From the outer extremity of the former (transverse process of the axis) the superior oblique passes almost directly upwards. The great occipital nerve will be seen winding round the lower border of the inferior oblique, and crossing the triangle formed by the small posterior cranio-vertebral muscles. Within the triangle will be seen the vertebral artery running horizontally inwards upon the posterior arch of the atlas. Between the artery & the bone, there will be seen the posterior branch of the sub-occipital nerve entering the triangle, and supplying the three small muscles and the complexus. With a little care, there will be seen the anterior division of the same nerve as it passes forwards on the inner side of the vertebral artery and rectus lateralis muscle, and also the ganglion on its posterior root.* * It is a good plan to find the roots of the sub-occipital nerve within the spinal canal as they arise from the upper part of the side of the cord.

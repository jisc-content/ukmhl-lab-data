71 If the head and neck have been dissected, complete the cleaning of the trapezius. Detach it from the spine of the scapula and lift it up, and clean the supra-spinatus, and the scapular attachments of the levator anguli scapulse and omo-hyoid. With the latter, clean the adjoining part of the supra-scapular artery and nerve as they pass respectively, the former over, the latter through, the notch in the upper border of the scapula. Do not divide the tipper part of the trapezius.

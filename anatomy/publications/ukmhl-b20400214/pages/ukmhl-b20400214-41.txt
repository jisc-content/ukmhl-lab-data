37 IV. PTERYGO-MAXILLARY REGION. This dissection should not be undertaken till the triangles of the neck have been cleaned—especially the upper part of the anterior triangle—this including the facial and auriculo-temporal nerves, and the other structures in and beneath the parotid gland, down to the wall of the pharynx & vertebra. (See upper part of Anterior Triangle of Neck.) The cleaning of the inferior maxillary nerve outside the cranium is facilitated by the previous cleaning of the same inside the cranium, as it is leaving the cranium through the foramen ovale. A probe passed through the foramen ovale by the side of the nerve is an additional help of no mean value. This is one of the most difficult parts to dissect, and one requiring much care. The difficulty of the dissection is threefold :—(1.) No less than four preliminary operations, each involving danger to some structure or other, have to be under- taken before all the branches of the internal maxillary artery and inferior maxillary nerve can be got at. (2.) Some of the branches of the artery, and most of the branches of the nerve, have to be traced, not from the corresponding trunk, but, at least to some extent, towards it. (3.) The relatively superficial structures stand in many places in the way of cleaning the deeper ones. Preliminary operations above alluded to:— 1. The masseter should be cleaned and lifted up, - with care at its upper and back part, where the vessels and nerve enter the muscle, - and the temporal fascia should be removed. A chain saw should now be introduced beneath the zygoma, and the latter should be sawn through as far forwards, and as far backwards as possible. The masseter should now be turned down, the masseteric branches of the internal maxillary artery and inferior maxillary nerve being found as they enter its upper and back part. These should be divided a short distance from the muscle. Before dividing the nerve, however, it is

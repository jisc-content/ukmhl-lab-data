61 I. ( AXILLA & FRONT OF ARM. Arm drawn away from side. Skin incisions:—Down middle of sternum, across lower part of axilla, along whole length of clavicle, down whole length of front of arm to two inches below bend of elbow. This long incision down the front of the arm will facilitate the dissector's work. The axilla should be taken along with the front of the arm, one dissec- tion being a help towards the other. It is scarcely worth while looking for the cutaneous nerves (superficial descending branches of the cervical plexus),* but the cephalic vein should be found between the pectoralis major and the deltoid, and it should be carefully traced with the accom- panying descending branch of the acromio-thoracic artery. Clean the pectoralis major down to its lower border. There is a sudden transition, opposite the lower border of the pectoralis major, from the laminated fascia covering the n.uscle to the loose cellular tissue which fills the axilla. As soon as the change takes place, the dissector has come to the level at which he should begin to look for the iDtercosto- humeral nerve. Look for the intercosto-hameral nerve by tearing the cellular * These should be looked for in the posterior triang'e of the neck. It may be well for the dissector of the arm to wait a little for the dissector of the head & neck. When the latter has found these nerves in the posterior triangle, they can be traced with ease on to the front of the chest,—to the advantage of both dissectors.

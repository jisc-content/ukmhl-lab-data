41 The buccal and anterior deep temporal nerves have been seen to arise, as a rule, from a common trunk. The former nerve, easily found in front of the tendon of the temporal muscle, will probably lead up to the latter; and then the trunk common to these can be traced back through the o external pterygoid muscle to the anterior aspect of the inferior maxillary nerve close to the cranium. This common trunk generally gives off the nerve to the external pterygoid, which reaches the inner surface of the muscle. The masseteric nerve will probably lead up similarly to the posterior deep temporal; then the common trunk of these nerves can be followed up to the outer aspect of the inferior maxillary, also close to the cranium. There remains the nerve to the internal pterygoid. It is a large branch, which reaches the inner surface of the muscle towards its middle. But the nerves to the pterygoid muscles, especially the nerve to the internal pterygoid, had better be looked for from the inner side in connection with the dissec- tion of the otic ganglion. V. SUB-MAXILLARY REGION AND TONGUE. This region should not be got out till after the triangles of the neck, the face, and the pterygo-niaxillary region have been dissected. 4

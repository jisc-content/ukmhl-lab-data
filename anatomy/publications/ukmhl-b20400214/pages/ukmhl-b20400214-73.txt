69 of the interosseous membrane & the oblique or round ligament, traversed by the posterior interosseous artery. It will consider- ably facilitate the dissection of this artery if the passage is opened up both from the front and from the back. The super- ficial dissection of the back of the forearm being completed, and the artery being traced to the upper border of the interosseous membrane, a probe should be passed from before backwards along the course of the artery, which will thus easily be found in the upper & back part of the forearm. IV. BACK OF FOREARM. If not already done (see page 66), trace radial nerve, and dorsal cutaneous branch of ulnar, to back of hand and fingers; and trace radial artery to back of wrist beneath extensor tendons of the thumb. Trace extensor tendons of fingers to bases of second and third phalanges. Divide posterior annular ligament of the wrist, raise above- mentioned tendons and lower part of corresponding muscles, and clean the deep muscles of the back of the forearm (exten- sores ossis metacarpi pollicis, primi and secundi internodii pollicis, and indicis) as they emerge from between the superficial extensor muscles, and the tendons of the extensores carpi radiales longior & brevior.

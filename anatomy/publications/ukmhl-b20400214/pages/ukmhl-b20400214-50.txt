46 one, is really not so, provided the dissector understands what difficulties it is that he has to contend with. The difficulties worth mentioning present themselves in connection with (1) the fourth nerve ; (2) the lachrymal nerve ; (3) the Grasserian ganglion; (4) the "dangerous point," as the author calls it—i.e, the point where the third & ophthalmic nerves approach each other in the outer wall of the cavernous sinus. 1. Fourth Nerve.— From the point where it pierces the dura mater in the free border of the tentorium cerebelli, this nerve may be traced forwards without much difficulty for about a quarter of an inch ; but beyond this point it is extremely difficult to follow it from behind forzvards without breaking it. The least traction is sure to break it. But it is a relatively easy matter to dissect the nerve backwards from the orbit. For this purpose, find the nerve on the back part of the upper surface of the superior oblique muscle, and then trace it back- wards by carefully dividing the fascia on either side of it and close to it, and finally turning it out of its bed with the flat of the knife. In thus dissecting the nerve backwards it is quite unnecessary to catch hold of it with the forceps. 2. Lachrymal Nerve.—From the dissector's point of view, this nerve may be divided into an anterior portion, which, th.ough extremely delicate, can be cleaned quite easily on account of its lying in the extremely loose cellular tissue of the orbit, and a posterior portion, which lies in dense fascia beneath the lesser wing of the sphenoid. What the dissector should do in order to get out this posterior part of the nerve,

7 Knowledge of this kind is only to be obtained by careful & repeated dissections. But for repeated dissections to be possible in the present congested state of the medical curriculum, the student must learn to dissect both efficiently and without loss, - i.e., un- necessary expenditure, - of time; he must learn to dissect well and quickly. The author's endeavour is to teach him to do this. Some effort of the kind seemed called for. With the increased pressure in various directions, which marks the present epoch, we seem threatened more and more every year with a serious decline of practical work in anatomy. It scarcely covers the ground to say that we no longer dissect as we used to, - and should, if the old standards of practical surgery are to be maintained. A kind of theoretical or black- board anatomy seems to be taking the place of the old practical work ; the object, of some at least, being apparently to form mental pictures of things, - a kind of aerial embodi- ment of words learnt more or less by heart, - and by means of which the ivords may the more easily be remembered for a given time. The remedy submitted is not an untried one, at least in the small area of the author's more immediate surroundings. The present 6 Guides ' are but an expansion of leaflets of similar design, which have been in constant use for many years in the author's dissecting-room, and which are believed to have helped many.

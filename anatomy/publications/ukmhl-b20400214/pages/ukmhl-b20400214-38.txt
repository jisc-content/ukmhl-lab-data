34 Clean the levator labii superioris alseque nasi. From beneath its inner edge will be seen to emerge the pale fibres of the compressor nasi. Its outer edge is contiguous inferiorly with the levator proprius labii superioris. There may now be taken in succession the levator proprius labii superioris, the zygomaticus minor, the zygomaticus major, the risorius, and the depressor anguli oris or triangularis oris. These muscles, with which may be associated the foregoing levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, form a radiating plane of fibres, continuous at its insertion into the orbicularis oris, interrupted peripherally. It will be noticed that the levator anguli oris and the buccinator have been left out from the place they are usually made to occupy in the enumeration of the muscles of the face. The reason is that, as shown in the above list, they belong to a deeper plane than the foregoing, as do also the depressor labii inferioris or quadratus menti, and the already-mentioned compressor nasi. The more superficial plane being well made out, and its several fascicles cleaned and lifted up, it will be easy, through

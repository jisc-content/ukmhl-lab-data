97 femoris, which latter muscle should be carefully cleaned under- neath and well lifted up, so as to allow the dissector to get at the above-mentioned structures. IV. POPLITEAL SPACE. In the dissection of the popliteal space the superficial structures again stand much in the way of the deeper ones, but in a manner different from that noticed in the regions of the lower limb already studied. Here the superficial structures do not, to any marked extent, cross the deeper ones; they simply lie in front of them. The principal vessels & nerves form one large vasculo-nervous bundle, and nothing more. Here is emphatically a case for the dissector to get behind the vasculo- nervous bundle, and to the sides of it, so as to clean it all round. The dissector, having already got out the external or short saphenous vein and the two heads of origin of the external or short saphenous nerve, and thus opened up the popliteal space superficially, should now dissect wide of the space itself. He should clean, and raise, the inner & outer heads of the gas- trocnemius in search of the two inferior articular arteries; the inner one he will find running downwards & inwards upon the head of the tibia, and, if not seen at once, distinctly percep- tible, at least, to the finger; the outer one he will similarly find running directly outwards above the head of the fibula. By similarly cleaning and raising, on the one hand, the biceps, and, on the other, the semi-tendinosus and -membranosus, he will also, without difficulty, come upon the two superior articular arteries. These lie close upon the femur, a little above the condyles, in the midst of a large amount of loose

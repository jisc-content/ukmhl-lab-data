DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 532 middle horn runs into the middle lobe, descends towards the base of the brain, making a very curious curve, like a ram's horn—that is, in a direction backwards, outwards, downwards, forwards, and inwards; the initial letters of which make the memorial word * bodfi.' By cutting through the substance of the middle lobe, the ■windings of this horn can be followed; in it are the hippocampus major, the pes hippocampi, the posterior crus of the fornix, the choroid plexus, and the thalamus opticus.

TEANSYEESE PEEPBNDICTJXAB SECTION THEOUGH THE BBA.IN. Appearance on perpen- dicular sec- tion. letter T. If a perpendicular section were made across the middle of the brain, the lateral ventricles would appear as represented in fig. 127. Together with the third or middle ventricle, their shape slightly resembles the Such a section shows well the radiating fibres of the corpus callosum, the fornix, and the velum interpositum beneath it; also the beginning of the transverse fissure at the base of the brain, between the crus cerebri and the middle lobe. sometimes they are absent in one or in both. They are only found in the brain of man and the qnadrumana. In the carnivora, ruminantia, solipeda, pachydermata, and rodentia, the lateral ventricles are prolonged into the largely developed olftictory lobes. This is the case in the human fcEtus only at an early period.

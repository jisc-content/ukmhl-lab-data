122 THORACIC DUCT. Fig. 24. covered by pericardium. In its course it receives all the right intercostal veins, the spinal veins, the oesophageal and commonly the right bronchial vein. Opposite the sixth dorsal vertebra it is joined by the left vena azygos. The left vena azygos, 'vena azygos minor,' runs up the left side of the spine. This vein commences in the abdomen by small branches communicating with the inferior vena cava, and ascends on the left side of the aorta, through the aortic opening in the diaphragm. On a level with the sixth or seventh dorsal vertebra, it passes beneath the aorta and joins the azygos major. Before passing beneath the aorta it usually communicates with the left superior intercostal vein. It receives five or six of the lower intercostal veins of the left side. None of these veins are provided with valves. The purpose of the azygos vein is to be supplemental to the inferior vena cava. The thoracic duct Thoracic 24) is a canal about eighteen inches long, through which the contents of the lacteal vessels from the DIAGRAM TO SHOW THE COURSE OF THE Intcstines aud tho absorbents from VENA AZYGOS AND THE THORACIC DUCT, ^j^^ lowcr Hmbs 3X6 couvcyed into the blood.

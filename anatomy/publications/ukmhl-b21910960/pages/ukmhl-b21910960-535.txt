519 MEDULLA OBLONGATA. in tlieir interior, which is continuous with that in the posterior part of the spinal cord. The posterior pyramids are two slender white bundles placed on each side of the posterior median fissure (fig. 121). They pass upwards and then diverge from each other, forming the apex of the fourth ventricle. They proceed with the restiform bodies for some distance, leaving which, they are lost in the cerebrum. At Fig. 121. DIAGBAM OF THE FOUETH TENTEICLE AND EESTIFOEM: BODIES. 1. Thalamus opticus. 4. Processus a cerebello ad testes. 2. Nates and testes. 5. Eestifonn bodies diverging. 3. Origin of fourth nerve. 6. Origin of seventh or auditory nerve. their point of divergence the posterior pyramids become slightly enlarged, forming what is called the 'processus clavatus.'' When a longitudinal section is carefully made through the middle of the medulla oblongata, a number of white fibres are seen running in a horizontal direction, constituting a kind of septum between the two halves. Some of these septal fibres issue from the anterior median fissm-e, wind round the medulla, and constitute what are termed the arciform fibres of Eolando (p. 517); others, issuing from the posterior fissore, wind roimd in a similar manner,

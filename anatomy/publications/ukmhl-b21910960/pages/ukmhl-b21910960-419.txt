The partition is only complete near the root of the penis; along the rest of the organ there are gaps in it, giving it the appearance of a comb; hence its name ' septum pectiniforme.^ Through this partition the blood vessels on one side communicate freely with those on the other.

The interior of each cylinder is occupied by a number of delicate elastic fibrous septa (' trabeculiwhich intersect each other in all directions, and form a multitude of minute cells. These com- municate freely with each other, as may be readily ascertained by blowing air into the penis. They are not of equal size throughout the penis; they are smaller, and their component septa thicker at the circumference than in the centre of the corpora cavernosa; at the root, than towards the glans. All the cells communicate freely with the arteries. When the penis is flaccid, they are empty; when it is erect, they are distended with blood. The arteries of the corpora cavernosa come from the pudic, enter the inner side of each crus, and proceed forwards near the septum, distributing numerous ramifications. These are supported in the middle of the fibrous septa, and end, some in capillaries which discharge their blood at once into the cells, others in tendril-like prolongations with dilated extremities which project mto the cavities of the veins. These arteries (called ' Jielicine' by Muller) are absent near the glans, and are best marked at the root of the penis. 1) 1) 2

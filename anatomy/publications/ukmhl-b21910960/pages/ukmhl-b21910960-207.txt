OTIC GANGLION. 191 it is the medium through which motor filaments are conveyed to it. The otic ganglion was discovered and described by gUon^'"'" Arnold, a Grerman anatomist, in 1826.* ' It is situ- ated,' he says, ' on the inner side of the inferior max- illary division of the fifth pair, immediately below its exit through the foramen ovale. (See diagram, page 188.) Its inner surface is in contact with the circumflexus palati muscle and the cartilage of the Eustachian tube, and immediately behind it is the middle meningeal artery.' It is always of very small size. Eespecting its connections with other nerves, Arnold states that the otic ganglion derives filaments (of sensation) from the inferior maxillary, and also from the branch of this nerve, which goes to the internal pterygoid muscle. It also derives a slender filament from the temporo-auricular nerve. Its communication with the sympathetic is established by filaments which proceed from the * nervi molles ' round the middle meningeal artery. It communi- cates also with the facial and glosso-pharyngeal nerves by a branch commonly called the lesser 'petrosal nerve. This nerve passes backwards either through the foramen ovale or the foramen spinosum, or through a small hole between the two, and runs beneath the dura mater along a minute groove on the petrous bone (outside the great petrosal nerve). Here it divides into two filaments, one of which joins the facial nerve in the aqueductus Fallopii, the other joins the tympanic branch of the glosso-pharyn- geal. These nerves are exceedingly difficult to trace, not only on account of their minute size, but also because they frequently run in canals in the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The otic ganglion sends a branch to the tensor tympani and to the circumflexus palati muscles. * J. Arnold, Diss, inaiig. med. &c.: Heidelbergae, 1826.

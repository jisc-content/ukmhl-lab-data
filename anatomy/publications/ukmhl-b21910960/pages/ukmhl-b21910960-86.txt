70 STRUCTURE OF THE EYELIDS. Tig. 13. closed, their margins are in such accurate apposition, that not the slightest interstice can be discovered between them. The punda lacrymalia are two pin-holes apertures, easily dis- covered on the margin of the lids, close to the inner angle. They are the orifices of the canals, called canalicuH, which pass inwards, and convey the tears into the lachrymal sac. Observe that their orifices are directed backwards. In facial palsy, the tensor tarsi being affected, the puncta lose their proper direction, and the tears flow over the cheek. In the introduction of probes for the purpose of opening the contracted puncta, or of slitting up the lachrymal duct, it is necessary to know the exact direction of these tubes. {See diagram.) By passing a bristle into one of them, we find that it does not run straight from the punctum to the sac, but that it proceeds for a short distance perpendicularly, and then, dilating into a small pouch, makes a sharp bend inwards to the la- chrymal sac. In the majority of cases, the tubes open into the sac by a common orifice. When, from any cause, the tears are secreted in greater quantity than usual, they overflow and trickle down thecheek. The eyelashes (cilia) are planted in two or more rows along the edge of the tarsal cartilages. The eyelashes of the upper lid are longer and more numerous than in the lower; and their convexity is directed downwards, while those of the lower lid have an opposite curve. The bulbs of the lashes are situated between the tarsal cartilage and the fibres of the ciliary muscle. They are supplied with blood by the palpebral branches of the ophthalmic, which run parallel and close to the free borders of the lids under the ciliary muscle. These sebaceous glands, so called after the anatomist* who first Â« H. Meibom, De vasis palpelDrariiin novis. Helmstedt, 1666.

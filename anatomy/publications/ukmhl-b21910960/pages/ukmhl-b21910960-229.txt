LIGAMENTS CONNECTING THE HEAD TO THE SPINE. 213 Capsular Each joint between the articular processes has a cap- hgaments. gular ligament and a synovial membrane. The surfaces of the bones are crusted with cartilage. Inter- Tbese are thin bands of fibres which pass between transverse the transverse processes of the vertebrae. They are igamen b. rudimentary in the cervical region, and are sometimes absent. Motions of Though but little movement is permitted between the spine. any two vertebrae (the atlas and axis excepted), yet the collective motion between them all is considerable. The spine can be bent forwards, backwards, or on either side; it also admits of shght rotation. In consequence of the elasticity of the inter- vertebral cartilages and the Hgamenta subflava, it returns spon- taneously to its natural curve of rest like an elastic bow. Its mobility is greatest in the cervical region, on account of the thickness of the fibro-cartilages, the small size of the vertebree, the^ oblique direction of their articulations, and, above all, the horizontal position and the shortness of their spines. In the dorsal region there is very Httle mobility, on account of the vertical direction of the articular processes, and the manner in which the arches and the spines overlap each other. In the lumbar region, the spine again becomes more movable, on account of the thickness of the intervertebral cartilages, and the horizontal direction of the spinous processes. Ligaments ^^^^ occiput is connected to the atlas by an anterior L^itTi*^' (occipito-atlantoid) membrane which passes from the bone and foramen magnum to the front part of the atlas. The SrtS! ^^'^^^^'^ P^'* ^^^^ is i^ the middle. A posterior (occipito-atlantoid) membrane extends in a similar manner from the posterior border of the foramen magnum to the arch of the atlas. It is perforated by the vertebral artery and the suboccipital nerve. The movements which take place between these bones are flexion and extension, as in nodding forwards and backwards; and lateral movement, as in inclining the head sideways. Â°

STRUCTURE OP THE BLADDER AND PROSTATE, 392 vai-y in number from tliree to five. The nerves of opposite sides unite in front of the coccyx, where they form the 'ganglion The plan upon which the sympathetic nerves are distributed in the pelvis is similar to that in the abdomen. Each ganglion re- ceives one or two filaments from a spinal nerve, and then gives off its branches to the viscera. The visceral branches are exceedingly delicate, and cannot be traced unless the parts have been previ- ously hardened in spirit. They accompany the arteries supplying the respective organs, and are called the ' vesical,' ' prostatic,' and inferior hsemorrhoidal plexuses;' and in the female the ' uterine' and ' vaginal.' According to the accurate dissections of Miiller, the vesical filaments of the sympathetic do not stop at the prostate, but pass on beneath the pubic arch into the corpus cavernosum penis. Thus the erectile tissue of the intromittent organ is brought directly within the influence of the sympathetic system. STEUCTUEE OF THE BLADDEE, PEOSTATE, UEETHEA, AND PENIS. The parts are presumed to have been collectively taken out from the pelvis, and the partial peritoneal covering of the bladder to have been removed. The bladder is composed of a partial peritoneal coat, Structure of ^ muscular, and a mucous ; these latter are connected by the bladder. intermediate layer of cellular tissue, out of which anatomists make a fourth coat, and call it the cellular. The serous or peritoneal coat invests the posterior, lateral, and superior surfaces of the bladder; being absent on the anterior and inferior aspect. The muscular is situated beneath the serous, and consists of unstriped or involuntary muscular fibres, which interlace with each other in all directions. Their general arrangement is as follows:â€”An outer, or longitudinal, layer arises from the upper Jj^lf of the circumference of the prostate and the neck of the

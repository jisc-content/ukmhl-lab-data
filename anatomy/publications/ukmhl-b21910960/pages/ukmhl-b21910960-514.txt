498 SOLE OF THE FOOT. Having traced the principal vessels and nerves, di- oSsdes.'^ vide them with the flexor tendons near the os calcis, and turn them down toward the toes, to expose the deep muscles in the sole. These are, the flexor brevis and ad- ductor pollicis, the flexor brevis minimi digiti, and the transversalis pedis. This muscle aHses from the external cuneiform and ■^imcis^'''''^'^ cuboid bones. It proceeds along the metatarsal bone ^° "^'^ of the great toe, and divides into two portions, which run one on each side of the long flexor tendon, and are inserted by tendons into the sides of the first phalanx of the great toe. The inner tendon is inseparably connected with the abductor pollicis, the outer with the adductor pollicis. In each tendon there is a sesamoid bone. These bones not only increase the strength of the muscle, but both together form a pulley for the free play of the long flexor tendon; so that in walking the tendon is not pressed upon. Its nerve comes from the internal plantar. This very powerful muscle arises from the cuboid, ^'^,^.''9''°'^ and the third and fourth metatarsal bones. Parsing ^° obliquely across the foot, it is inserted through the external sesamoid bone into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe together with the inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis. This muscle greatly contributes to support the arch of the foot. Like the adductor of the thumb it should be considered as an interosseous muscle. This little muscle arises from the base of the fifth Flexor brevis j^^etatarsal bone, proceeds forwards along it, and is minimi digiti. .^^^ ^^g^ ti^e first phalanx of the little This slender muscle runs transversely across the TransversaUs ^^^g ^-^^ metatarsal bones. It anses by little fleshy slips from the four outer toes, and is inserted into the first phalanx of the great toe with the adductor pollicis, of which it ought to be considered a part. The fourth layer of muscles consists of the interossei.

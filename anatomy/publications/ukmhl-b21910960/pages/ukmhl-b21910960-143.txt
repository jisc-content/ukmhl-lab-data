127 INTEKCOSTAL VESSELS. unite into a single nerve, which passes through the corresponding cms of the diaphragm, and joins the semilunar ganglion of the abdomen, sending also branches to the renal plexus. b. The lesser splancJmic nerve is commonly formed by branches from the tenth and the eleventh ganglia. It passes through the crus of the diaphragm to the renal plexus.* c. The smallest splanchnic nerve comes from the twelfth ganglion, passes through the crus of the diaphragm, aud terminates in the renal plexus. (This is not seen in the diagram.) Intercostal ^^^^ intercostal muscles occupy the intervals between n^uscles.'' Between each rib there are two layers of muscles which cross like the letter X. The external layer runs obliquely from behind, forwards, like the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. The internal layer runs from before backwards like the internal oblique. Observe that a few fibres of the inner layer pass over one or even two ribs, and ter- minate upon a rib lower down. But neither of these layers extends all the way between the sternum and the spine: the outer layer, beginning at the spine, ceases at the cartilages of the ribs; the inner, commencing at the sternum, ceases at the angles of the ribs. The intercostal muscles present a curious intermixture of tendi- nous and fleshy fibres; and they are covered inside and outside the chest by a glistening fascia, to give greater protection to the intercostal spaces. The external intercostal muscles elevate the ribs, and are there- fore muscles of inspiration. The internal intercostal muscles de- press the ribs, and are therefore muscles of expiration.

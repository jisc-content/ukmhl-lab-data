582 DISSECTION OP THE TESTIS. which some anatomists have described as a distinct coat, under the name of tunica vasculosa. pletely covers the testicle, except behind, where the vessels and duct are placed (fig. 138); and that it also covers part of the outer side of the epididymis. The interior of the sac is smooth and polished, like all other serous membranes, and lubricated by a little fluid. An excess of this fluid gives rise to the disease termed 'hydrocele.' The tunica vaginalis was originally derived from the perito- neum. In some subjects it still communicates with that cavity by a narrow neck, and is therefore liable to become the sac of a hernia (see diagram, p. 324). Such hernise are termed congenital â€”a bad name, since they do not, as a matter of course, take place at birth, but often in adult age. Sometimes the communication continues through a very contracted canal, open to the passage of fluid only; or the communication may be only partially obliterated, and then one or more isolated serous sacs are left along the cord. Such an one, when distended by fluid, gives rise to hydi-ocele of the cord. invests the testicle, but not the epididymis. At the posterior part of the gland it penetrates into its substance for a short distance, and forms an incomplete vertical septum, termed, after the anato- mist who first described it, ' corpus EighmoH,^ and subsequently, by Sir A. Cooper, the 'mediastinum testis' (fig. 138). This sep- tum transmits the blood vessels of the gland, and contains, also, the network of seminal ducts, called the rete testis, shown in diagram 137. From the medias:inum testis are given off in all directions a number of slender fibrous cords, which traverse the interior of Timica albuginea. This tunic is a dense, inelastic membrane, composed of fibrous tissue, interlacing in every direction, analo- gous to the sclerotic coat of the eye. It completely

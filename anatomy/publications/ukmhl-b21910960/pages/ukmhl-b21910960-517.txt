LIGAMENTS OF THE HIP. 501 that its general structure resembles that between the bodies of the vertebra. In the upper part of this fibro-cartilage is a smooth cavity lined with epithelium. The cartilage acts like a buffer, and breaks the force of shocks passing through the pelvic arch. The ileum is connected with the fifth lumbar vertebra by the ilio-lumbar ligament. It is very strong, and extends from the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra to the crest of the ileum (fig. 111). This is secured by, I, an anterior ligament which symphysis, consists ot ligamentous fibres passing in front; 2, a posterior ligament, composed of fibres much stronger and more marked, which pass behind the articulation. The anterior part of the bones forming this articulation is crusted with articular cartilage, of which the shape is like that of the ear. Behind this is the strong interosseoits ligament, which contributes powerfully to the security of the joint.

The great sacro-ischiatic extends from the posterior inferior spine of the ileum, and the side of the sacrum and coccyx, to the tuberosity of the ischium. The lesser sacro-ischiatic ligament passes from the sacrum and coccyx to the spine of the ischium.

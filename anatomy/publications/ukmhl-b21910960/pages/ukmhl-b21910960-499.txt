BACK OF THE THIGH. 483 tinues nearly down to the external condyle. It joins the longer part of the muscle, and both terminate on a common tendon, which is inserted into the head of the fibula, by two portions sepa- rated by the external lateral ligament of the knee-joint. It also gives off a strong expansion to the fascia of the leg. The tendon covers part of the external lateral ligament of the knee-joint, a,nd a small bursa intervenes.* The biceps is not only a flexor of the leg, but rotates the leg, when bent, outwards. It is this muscle which dislocates the knee outwards and backwards in chronic disease of the joint. Each portion of the biceps is supplied by the great ischiatic nerve. The short head is sometimes supplied by the peroneal. Semiten "^'^^^ arises, in common with the biceps, also by mus- ednosns' fibi'es internal to the common origin, from the back part of the tuber ischii. The fibres terminate upon a long tendon, which spreads out below the knee-joint, and is inserted into the inner surface of the tibia, below the tendon of the gracilis, and behind that of the sartorius. Like them, it plays â– over the internal lateral ligament of the knee, and is provided with a bursa to prevent friction. Its nerve comes from the ischiatic. The semitendinosus sends off from the lower border of its tendon a very strong fascia to cover the leg, which is attached along the inner edge of the tibia. The middle of the muscle is intersected by an oblique tendinous line.

This tendon descends obliquely behind the biceps and semitendinosus, and terminates in a bulky muscle, which lies on a deeper plane than the others, and is inserted by a thick tendon into the posterior part of the head of the tibia. In connection with this tendon, notice three additional points that it is prolonged under the internal lateral ligament of the knee, and I I 2

427 SPLEEN. these are numerous other cells, some caudate, others nucleated, and others altered blood-cells either free or contained within larger cells. In the pulp are found numerous white spherical bodies, 'Malpighian corpuscles,^ of about the -g-oth of an inch in diameter.* These cor- puscles are not free like the smaller cells, but are attached by slender pedicles to the walls of small arteries, from whose sheaths the capsules of these bodies are derived. The artery ramifies over the surface of the corpuscles, and then terminates in a brush of capillaries, which spread out into the pulp. The interior of each corpuscle is filled with a whitish ■ fluid, containing numerous small granular cells. The splenic artery enters the spleen by several branches, which ramify throughout the organ, supported by sheaths derived from the capsule.f These branches subdivide in the trabecular tissue, and the small ramifications spread out in a brush-like manner through the pulp, and terminate in capillaries which open into the veins (and also, according to Gray, into lacunar spaces from which the veins originate). The main branches of the artery do not communicate with one another, for if injection be thrown separately into one branch, it fills only that part of the spleen to which the artery is distributed. Thus it appears that the spleen is essentially a great blood gland; and that it consists of chambers filled with secreting gland cells of various size, between which ramify minute arteries and vems. It is presumed that the gland elaborates the albuminous materials of food, and stores them up for a time before they pass into the blood. It is considered to be a nursery for the production of the white corpuscles of the blood; and a grave-yard too, where many of the worn-out red ones undergo disintegration.

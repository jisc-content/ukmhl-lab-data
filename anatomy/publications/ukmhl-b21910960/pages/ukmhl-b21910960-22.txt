6 SINUSES OP THE DURA MATER. deeper as it extends backwards. Its upper edge is convex and attached to the median groove on the inner aspect of the vertex of the skull; its inferior margin is concave and free, and runs along the upper aspect of the corpus callosum. From its base or broadest part proceeds the horizontal partition named ' tentorium cerehellV This forms an arch for the support of the cerebeUi'^ posterior cerebral lobes, so that they may not press upon the cerebellum beneath them. Observe that the tentorium is attached to the transverse ridge of the occipital bone, to the superior margin of the petrous part of the temporal bone, and to the posterior and anterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid. The little partition which separates the lobes of the ■^^^ „. cerebellum is called ' falx cerehellV It is placed ver- cerebelii. •' ^ ^ . tically in the same line with the falx cerebri, and its point is attached to the edge of the foramen magnum. Sinuses of peculiarities of the cerebral circula- THE DOTiA tion that the blood is returned through canals or ' sinuses ' formed by the dura mater. These canals are produced by a splitting of the dura mater into two layers as shown in fig. 1, where 1 represents a vertical section through the superior longitudinal ^' sinus. They are lined by the same smooth — "" membrane as the rest of the venous sys- tem. Since their walls consist of unyield- ing structure, and are always on the stretch, it is obvious that they are admirably adapt- ed to resist the pressure of the brain. There are fifteen of these sinuses; five are pairs, and five are single, as follow:— The five pairs of sinuses arc,— The five single sinuses are,— The lateral. The superior longitudinal. The superior petrosal. The inferior longitudinal. The inferior petrosal. The circular. The cavernous. The transverse. The occipital. The straight. All of these eventually discharge their blood into the internal jugular vein.s. t

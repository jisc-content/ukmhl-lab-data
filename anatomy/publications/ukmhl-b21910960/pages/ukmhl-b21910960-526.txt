510 LIGAMENTS OF THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. Fig. 117. ligament, form a complete socket for the head of the astragalus; it is this joint, chiefly, which permits the abduction and adduction of the foot. The chief peculiarity about the ligament is its elasticity. It acts in all re- spects like a spring, and allows to the key- stone of the arch a certain amount of play which is of great service in preventing con- cussion of the body. Whenever this ligament loses its elastic property, a.s is often the case with those who are in the habit of carrying heavy burdens, the arch of the foot gradually yields, and the individual becomes flat-footed. The OS calcis articulates with the os cuboides nearly on a line with the articulation between the astragalus and the os ecaphoides. The Calcaneo- ^ones are most firmly connected by cuboid means of a powerful ligament in ligament, ^-^^ sole, called the calcaneo-cuboid, or * ligamenttim longum plantae.' Some of its fibres extend forwards as far as the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones. It would be tedious to enumerate individually the several liga- ments which connect the remaining bones of the tarsus and meta- tarsus. Let it then suffice to say, that they are firmly braced together by very strong ligaments, both on their dorsal and their plantar surfaces, and by interosseous ligaments which extend be- tween their contiguous surfaces, like rivets. Thousfh there is very little motion between any two bones, the collective amount is such that the foot is enabled to adapt itself accur- ately to the ground: pressure is more equally Interosseous ligaments of ° ^ .1.1 • the wedge bones. distributed, and consequently there is a firmer basis for the support of the body. Being composed, moreover, of several pieces, each of which possesses a certain elasticity, the foot gains a general springiness and solidity which could n'>t have resulted from a single bone. 1.

DISSECTION OF THE LARYNX. 168 is triangular, as shown in fig. 34, where the arytenoid cartilages are cut th °ough on a level with the vocal cords. During every in- spiration, the glottis is dilated by the crico-arytenoidei postici; it then becomes spear-shaped (fig. 36). During expiration, it re- sumes its triangular shape : and this return to a state of rest is effected, not by muscular agency, but by two elastic ligaments shown in fig. 34, which draw the arytenoid cartilages together. Thus then 'the glottis, like the chest, is dilated by muscular tissue; like the chest, also, it is contracted by elastic tissue. In Fig. 35. Arytenoid cartilage Crico-arytcnoid joint {"f^''"'- ...

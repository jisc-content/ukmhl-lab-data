383 SIDE VIEW OF THE PELVIC VISCERA. axis of a child's bladder is more vertical than in the adult; for in children, the bladder is not a pelvic viscus. This makes lithotomy in them so much more difficult. The quantity of urine which the bladder will hold without much inconvenience varies. As a general rule it may be stated at about a pint. A good deal depends upon the habits of the individual; but some persons have, naturally, a very small bladder, and are obliged to empty it more frequently. In young persons the lowest part of the bladder is the neck, or that part which joins the prostate. But as age advances, the bottom of the bladder gradually deepens so as to form a well or pouch behind the prostate. In old subjects, more particularly if the prostate be enlarged, this pouch becomes of considerable depth, and renders micturition tedious. It sometimes happens that a stone in the bladder cannot be felt; the reason of which may be that the stone, lodged in such a pouch below the level of the neck of the bladder, escapes the detection of the sound. Under these circumstances, if the patient be placed on an inclined plane with the pelvis higher than the shoulders, the stone falls out of the pouch, and is easily recognisable.

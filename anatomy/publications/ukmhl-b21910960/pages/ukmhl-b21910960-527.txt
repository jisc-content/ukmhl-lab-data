511 DISSECTION OF THE BKAIN. Exclusive of the ankle-joint and the phalanges of the mPTObranes toes, the bones of the foot are provided with six dis- of the tarsus, ^jj^^j. gyQovial membranes ; namelyâ€” a. Between the posterior articular sirrface of the astragalus and OS calcis. h. Between the head of the astragalus and the scaphoid, and between the anterior articular surface of the astragalus and os calcis. c. Between the os calcis and the os cuboides. d. Between the inner cuneiform bone and the metatarsal bone of the great toe. e. Between the scaphoid and the three cuneiform bones, and be- tween these and the adjoining bones (the great toe excepted). /. Between the os cuboides and the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. The phalanges of the toes are connected in all respects like those of the fingers. See the description given in the dissection of the hand (p. 306). DISSECTION OF THE BEAIN. Membranes Previous to the examination of the brain itself, we of the brain, should study the structure and uses of the three mem- branes by which it is surrounded. The first, the 'dura mater,' has been described (p. 5). The second is a serous membrane, termed the ' arachnoid;' the third is a very vascular one, termed the ' jpia mater.^ Arachnoid T^hx^ second investment forms the smooth, polished membrane, surface of the brain, exposed after the removal of the dura mater. It is named ' arachnoid ' from the delicacy of its texture, like a spider's web. It is a serous membrane, and, like all others of the kind, forms a closed sac, one part of which, the * parietal' layer, lines the under surface of the dura mater; the other, the ' visceral,' is reflected over the brain : this re- flection takes place along the nerves which leave the base of the skull. The inner surface of this membrane is perfectly smooth, and

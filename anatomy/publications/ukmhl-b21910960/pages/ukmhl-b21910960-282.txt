DISSECTION OF THE PALM OF THE HAXD. 26G fibres converge and are inserted, along with the inner portion of the flexor brevis pollicis, into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. Its action is to draw the thumb towards the palm, as when we bring the tips of the thumb and little finger into contact. It is supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve, which also supplies the inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis. The other muscles of the ball of the thumb are supplied by the median nerve. Muscles of the "^^^ muscles of the little finger correspond in some ban ofthe* ^ measure with those of the thumb. Thus we have little finger. abductor, a flexor brevis, and an opponens minimi digiti. This, the most superficial of the muscles of the little Ahductor fi^o-er, arises from the pisiform bone, and from the tendinous expansion of the flexor carpi tiinans: it is inserted by a flat tendon into the base of the first phalanx of the little finger. Its action is to draw this finger from the rest. This slender muscle may fairly be considered as a Flexor brevis pQ^.^jo^ of the preceding. It arises from the unciform igi 1. ^^^^ annular ligament, and is inserted with the tendon of the abductor into the base of the first phalanx of the little finger. Its action is similar to that of the abductor. Between the origins of the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti, the deep branch of the ulnar artery and nerve sinks down to form the deep palmar arch. The last two muscles must be reflected from theu- dg'tT'"' insertion, to expose the opiponens digiti minimi. It minimi. arises from the unciform bone and the annular ligament, and is inserted along the shaft of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. Its action is to draw this bone, the most movable of all the metacarpal bones of the fingers, towards the thumb. Thus it greatly strengthens the grasp of the palm. Now cut through all the flexor tendons, and remove the deep fascia of the palm, to see the deep arch of arteries and its branches. nnches of '^'^^^ ^'^^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^"^^^'^ ^^^^ ^ SrradklÂ°ar-between the first and second metacarpal bones (be- tery in the , .^^^^^ ^^^^ of the flexor brevis and the palm. twccu.

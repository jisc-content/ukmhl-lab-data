SPHENO-MAXILLARY REGION. 86 To gain a good view of the muscles, nerves, and vessels of the pterygo-maxillary region, a portion of the ascending ramus of the jaw must be removed with a Hey's saw, as shown in the diagram below. ., , In this region we have to examine the two pterygoid muscles, the trunk and branches of the internal maxillary artery and nerve, and the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw. This muscle arises by two heads, one from the outer External surface of the external pterygoid plate (a few fibres pterygoid. ^^.^.^ ^^^^ ^^^^^ ^.^^ ^^^^ tuberosity of the palate bone); the other from the great wing of the sphenoid. It is inserted into the neck of the jaw, and slightly mto the border of the inter-articular fibro-cartilage of the jomt of the jaw. Anterior temporal n. and a. Fig. 15. External pterygoid m.

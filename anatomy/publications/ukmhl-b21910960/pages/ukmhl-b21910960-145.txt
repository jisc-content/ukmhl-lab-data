Each dorsal nerve (like all the spinal nerves) arises from the spinal cord by two roots, an anterior or motor, and a posterior or sensi- tive. The sensitive root has a ganglion upon it. The two roots unite in the intervertebral foramen and form' a compound nerve. Pig. 26. After passing through the foramen, it divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The posterior branches pass backwards between the transverse processes of the dor- sal vertebrae, and supply the muscles of the back. The anterior branches or the proper intercostal nerves pro- ceed along the intercostal spaces in company with, and immediately be- low, their corresponding arteries. Midway between the spine and the sternum, they give off lateral cu- taneous branches, which supply the skin over the scapula and the thorax. The intercostal nerves terminate in front, in the anterior cutaneous nerves; the upper six, coming through their respective intercostal spaces supply the skia over the chest; the six lower terminate m the front wall of the abdomen, near the linea alba Notice, that the first dorsal nerve ascends nearly perpen- dicularly over the neck of the first rib to form part of the brachial plexus. Before doing so, it sends a nerve to the first intercostal space.

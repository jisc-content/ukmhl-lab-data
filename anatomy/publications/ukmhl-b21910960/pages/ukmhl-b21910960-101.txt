SPIIENO-MAXILLAET REGION, 85 augment the power of the muscle by increasing its extent of orio-in. The masseteric nerve and artery enter the under surface of the muscle through the sigmoid notch of the jaw; the artery comes from the internal maxillary, the nerve from the motor division of the inferior maxillary. ^ This strong shining membrane covers the temporal apoXrosis. ^^^^^^ \ its chief use being to give additional origin to it. It is attached above to the temporal ridge, and increasing in thickness as it descends, divides near the zygoma into two layers, which are attached to the outer and inner surfaces of the zygomatic arch. These layers are separated by fat, in which is found a filament from the orbital branch of the supe- rior maxillary nerve. The density of this aponeurosis explains why abscesses in the temporal fossa rarely point outwards; the matter makes its way, beneath the zygoma, into the mouth. Eeflect the aponeurosis, and notice that it is separated from the temporal muscle, near the zygoma, by fat. The absorption of this fat, and the wasting of the muscle, occasion the sinking of the temple in emaciation and old age. Temporal "^"^""^^ ^'''^"^ temporal fossa and the muscle. temporal aponeurosis. It is inserted by a strong tendon into the inner surface, the apex, and anterior border of the coronoid process. The fibres of this muscle converging from their wide origin, pass under the zygomatic arch, and terminate upon their tendon, the outer surface of which is partially concealed by the insertion of hose fibres which come from the temporal aponeurosis: remove them and see how admirably this tendon radiates into the muscle like the ribs of a fan. Thus the force of the muscle is collected into one focus.

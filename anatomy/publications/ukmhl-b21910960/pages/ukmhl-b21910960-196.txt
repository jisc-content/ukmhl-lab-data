180 DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. the orbital surface of the superior oblique, to which it is exclusively distributed. This gland is situated within the external angular gkndJâ„¢*^ process of the frontal bone. It is about the size and shape of an almond. Its upper surface is convex, in adaptation to the roof of the orbit; its lower is concave, in adap- tation to the eyeball. The anterior part of the gland lies some- times detached from the rest, close to the back part of the upper eyelid, and is covered by the conjunctiva. The whole gland is kept in place by a capsule * formed by the fascia of the orbit. In structure it resembles the salivary glands. It consists of an aggregation of small lobes composed of smaller lobules, connected by fibro-cellular tissue. The excretory ducts, seven to ten in number, run parallel, and perforate the conjunctiva about a quarter of an inch above the edge of the tarsal cartilage (fig. 40). They are not easily discovered in the human eye, but in that of the horse or bullock they are large enough to admit a small probe. The secretion of the gland keeps the surface of the cornea constantly moist and polished ; but if dust, or any foreign substance, irritate the eye, the tears flow in abundance, and wash it off. All the muscles of the orbit, with the exception of the inferior oblique, arise from the margin of the foramen opticum, and pass forwards, like ribands, to their insertions. , ^ This muscle arises from the roof of the orbit, im- Levator palpebrae mediately in front of the optic foramen. It gradually supenons. increases in breadth, and terminates in a broad, thin aponeurosis, which is inserted into the upper surface of the tarsal cartilage beneath the palpebral ligament. It is constantly in * This capsule, being a little stronger on the under surface of tlie ghind, is described and figured by Soemmerring as a distinct ligament, ' Icones Oculi Humani,' tab. rii.

Celiac axis ^he caeliac axis arises from the front of tlie aorta, br^nihes ^^^ween the pillars of the diaphragm, just above the upper border of the pancreas. It is a very thick, short trunk, which after a course of about half an inch divides into three branches—the coronaria ventriculi or gastric, the splenic, and the hepatic. The coronaria ventriculi, the smallest of the three, ascends a little to the left towards the oesophageal end of the stomach, where it gives off branches to the oesophagus, which inosculate with the oesophageal offsets of the thoracic aorta. It then curves along the upper border of the stomach towards the pylorus, to anastomose with the pyloric branch of the hepatic artery. The hepatic artery mcends to the right between the layers of the lesser omentum to the transverse lissure of the liver, where it divides into two branches, right and left, for the supply of the respective lobes of the liver. In its course to the liver, it lies to the left of the bile duct, and in front of the portal vein; all three are contained in the right border of the lesser omentum. The hepatic gives off— a. The pyloric, which runs along the upper curve of the stomach from right to left, and inosculates with the coronaria ventriculi. 6. The gastro-epiploica dextra, which runs behind the duo- denum, then along the great curve of the stomach, from right to left, and inosculates directly with the gastro-epiploica sinistra, a' branch of the splenic. It gives off: 1. The pancreatico duodeualis, which runs down between the head of the pancreas and the de- scendmg part of the duodenum. It supplies branches to each, and'

LIGAMENTS OF THE ANKLE. 509 Fig. 116. Besides flexion and extension, the ankle-joint admits of a slight lateral movement, only permitted in the extended state of the joint. This is useful to us in the di- rection of our steps. In adaptation to this movement the internal malleolus is made shorter than the outer ; it is not so tightly confined by its ligaments, and its articular surface is part of a cylinder. Open the joint to see that the breadth of the articular surfaces of the bones is greater in front than behind. The ob- ject of this is to render the astragalus less liable to be dislocated backwards. Whenever this happens, the astragalus must of necessity become firmly locked between the malleoli. The astragalus is the comTiNG key-stone of the arch of the THE BONES OF foot, aud supports the whole THE FOOT. -yyeigiit of the body. It arti- culates with the OS calcis and the os sca- phoides in such a manner as to permit the abduction and adduction of the foot, so useful in the direction of our steps. The astragalus articulates with the os calcis by two distinct surfaces, respecting which remark, that the anterior is sKghtly convex, and the posterior slightly concave. This adaptation of itself contributes much to prevent the separation of the bones. But their principal bond of union is a strong interosse- l^MiTntÂ°^^ ows ligament which occupies the interval between them (fig. 116). In the skeleton the head of the astragalus articulates in front with the OS scaphoides, but a part of it is unsupported below. In Calcaneo- ^^^^ interval it is supported by a very strong and elastic scaphoid ligament, which extends from the os calcis to the os ligament. scaphoides (fig. 117). These bones, together with the.

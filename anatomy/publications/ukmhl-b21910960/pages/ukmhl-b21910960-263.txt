I>1SSECTI0N OF THE FKONT OF THE FOREARJl. 247 ulnar recurrent; 7, the common interosseous branch of the ulnar artery. Muscles of muscles of the forearm are arranged in two forearm. groups; one, consisting of supinators and extensors, is attached to the outer condyloid ridge and condyle ; the other, consisting of pronators and flexors, is attached to the inner condyle. The inner group should be examined first: they arise by a common tendon, and are arranged in the following order: pronator teres; flexor carpi radialis; palmaris longus ; flexor carpi ulnaris, and flexor subiimis digitorum. Pronator ^^^^ muscle forms the inner boundary of the tri- radii teres. angular space at the elbow. It arises from the anterior surface of the internal condyle, from the common tendon, and from the septum between it and the flexor carpi radialis. It has also a small tendinous origin from the coronoid process of the ulna. From these two origins, between which the median nerve passes, the muscle proceeds obliquely downwards, and is inserted by a flat tendon into 4 rough surface on the outer and back part of the middle third of the radius. In amputating the forearm, it is very desirable to save the insertion of this muscle, that the stump may have a pronator. Flexor carpi â€¢ ^^^"^^^'^^^^ arises by the common tendon from the radialis. eternal condyle, from the intermuscular septa, and _ from the fascia of the forearm. The fleshy fibres termmate near the middle of the forearm, in a flat tendon, which runs in a separate sheath outside the anterior annular ligament of the wrist, passes through a groove in the os trapezium, lined by a synovial membrane, and is inserted into the bases of the second and third metacarpal bones. Note that the outer border of its tendon is the guide to the radial artery in the lower half of the lorearm.

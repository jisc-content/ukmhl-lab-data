PARTS CONGEllNED IN INGUINAL HERNIA. 321 Internal ^he opening in the fascia ti'ansversalis through which abdominal the spermatic cord passes, is called the ' internal abdo- minal ring.'* It corresponds to a point midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis and about two-thirds of an inch above the crural arch. It is oval in shape, with the long diameter directed nearly vertically its margm is well defined on the pubic side, but not on the iliac 'and from Its border is continued forwards a funnel-shaped prolongation over the cord as it passes through the opening. This covering, thm and delicate, is termed the ' infundibuliform fascia: (This IS no seen in the diagram.) Close by the inner border of the in- ternal ring, the epigastric artery will be found ascending to enter the substance of the rectus. To see that part of the peritoneum concerned in ing-uinal hernia, he fascia transversalis must be removed by incisions similar to hose i-ecommended before. The fascia is easily separable from the peiitoneum, which is situated immediately behind it The peritoneum at the inner ring presents a well-marked depression which varies however, considerably; in some being scarcel/v s^e T o^^^^^^^ fnguinal'canaUn the form of a pouch. In some instances, a communication will be found still existing between the general cavity of the perZeum and the tunica vaginalis testis. peritoneum Inguinal examined the several strata through which canal. t^e Spermatic cord passes, replace them in their whole YoW^f examine the inguinal canal as'a ndtwafd? tlZZ'^^' obliquely downwards and a haTf f o , ^ well-formed adult male is from one conjoined tendon of fbl T i V '"'^ transversalis and the by he loweTfleshv fib transversalis ; above, below â„¢i a/ch ' " * Or the inner aperture of the inguinal canal.

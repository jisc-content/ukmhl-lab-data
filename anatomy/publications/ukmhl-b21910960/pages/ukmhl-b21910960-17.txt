A MANUAL OF THE DISSECTION OF THE HUMAN BODY. DISSECTION OF THE SCALP. An incision should be made from the nose along the mesial line to the occiput; another at right angles to the first from one side of the head to the other. These incisions must not divide more than the skin, that the subcutaneous vessels and nerves may not be injured. Strata com- "^^^ several strata of tissues covering the skull-cap posing the areâ€”1, the skin ; 2, a thin layer of adipose tissue which ^'^^^P- contains the cutaneous vessels and nerves and the bulbs of the hair; and by which the skin is very closely connected to, 3, the broad thin tendon of the occipito-frontalis muscle (aponeu- rosis of the scalp); 4, an abundance of loose areolar tissue, which permits the free motion of the scalp upon, 5, the pericranium, or periosteum of the skull-cap. Immediately beneath the skin, then, we expose the thin stratum of adipose tissue which connects it to the aponeurosis of the scalp. It forms a bed for the bulbs of the hair and for the ramifications of the cutaneous arteries. The toughness of this tissue, in which the arteries ramify, does not permit them to retract when divided ; hence the haemorrhage which follows incised wounds of the scalp ; hence, also, the difficulty of drawing them out with the forceps. The blood-vessels of the scalp are derived, in front, from the B

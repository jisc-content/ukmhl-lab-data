DISSECTION OF THE CHEST. 104 cartilages of the false ribs, and terminates near the last intercostal space. It supplies small arteries to the diaphragm, to the sixth, seventh, and sometimes the eighth intercostal spaces. Two venae comites surround the artery, and unite into a single trunk in the upper part of the chest, to terminate in the brachio- cephalic vein of its own side. There are several absorbent glands in the neighbourhood of the internal mammary artery. They receive the absorbents from the inner portion of the mammary gland, from the diaphragm, and the upper part of the abdominal wall. In disease of the inner portion of the mamma, these glands may enlarge without any enlargement of those in the axilla. ,^ The ' mediastiaa' are the spaces which the two Mediastma, anterior and pleural sacs leave between them in the antero-posterior posterior. plane of the chest. There is an anterior and a pos- terior mediastinum. To put these spaces in the simplest light, let us imagine the heart and lungs to be removed from the chest, and the two pleural sacs to be left in it by themselves. The two sacs, if inflated, would then appear like two bladders, in contact only in the middle, as shown by the dotted outlines in the an- nexed scheme (fig. 18). The interval marked a, behind the sternum, would represent the an- terior mediastinum: the interval b, the posterior mediastinum. But now let us introduce the heart and lungs again, between the two pleural sacs : these must give way to make room for them, so that the two sacs are not in contact anywhere in the middle line of the chest. Therefore, with the heart and lungs interposed, the pleural sacs appear as shown in the diagram, fig. 19,â€”which represents a trans- verse section through the chest. Here you see that the heart and the lungs become invested by the pleural sacs; or, to speak more

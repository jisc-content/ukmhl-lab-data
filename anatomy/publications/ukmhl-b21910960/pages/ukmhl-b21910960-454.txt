DISSECTION OP THE GROIN. 438 In many subjects we observe that transverse or Folds in the yi^iiq^e folds of the mucous membrane project into rectum. ' , i i the rectum. These cannot be seen to advantage unlees the bowel be hardened by alcohol in its natural position. Three, more prominent than the rest, and half an inch, or thereabouts, in width, were first pointed out by Mr. Houston.* One projects from the upper part of the rectum, opposite the prostate gland; another is situated higher up, on the side of the bowel; while the third is still higher. When thickened or ulcerated, these folds are apt to occasion great pain and obstruction in defaecation. THE DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. An incision should be made along the groin, from the anterior superior spine of the ileum to the spine of the pubes; another, from the middle of the first, down the thigh for about six inches. The skin being reflected, the superficial fascia and vessels will be exposed. This fascia varies in thickness according to the con- Superficial (ji^ion of the body. Like other superficial fascia it is divisible into two layers, between which are situated the inguinal glands, and the cutaneous vessels. The upper layer is continuous with that of the abdomen ; the deeper layer is best marked in the upper part of the thigh, especially where it stretches across the saphenous opening to form the cribriform fascia. The cutaneous vessels come from the femoral artery and are three in number, the superficial epigasti-ic, the superficial pudic, and the superficial circuvifiexa ilU arteries: the first ascends over Poupart's ligament to the abdomen; the second crosses mwards towards the pubes; and the third passes outwards to the ileum. Each artery is accompanied by one, sometimes by two vems, which empty themselves, either directly into the femoral, or into the great cutaneous vein of the thigh, called the ' saphena.' * Dublin Hospital Keports, vol. v.

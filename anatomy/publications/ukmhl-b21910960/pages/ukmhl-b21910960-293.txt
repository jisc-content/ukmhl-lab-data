MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDERf 277 Reflect the deltoid from its origin, and turn it downwards. Observe the ramifications of the circumflex artery and nerve, on its under surface: also the large bursa between it and the tendons inserted into the head of the humerus. See how the muscle pro- tects the shoulder-joint; how it covers the coraco-acromial liga- ment, the head, neck, and upper part of the humerus, as well as the tendons inserted into the greater tuberosity. Bur-^a under ^ ^^^'^^ ^^^f ^ ^^^^ situated between the deltoid, tliTdeitdd!' ^^^^ tendons inserted into the head of the humerus. It extends for some distance beneath the acromion and the coraco-acromial ligament, and covers the great tuberosity of the humerus. I have seen it communicating by a wide opening with the shoulder-joint, but this is a rare exception. Its use is to facilitate the movements of the head of the bone under the acromial arch. Posterior This artery is given off from the axillary: it runs drcumflex behind the surgical neck of the humerus, through a ^' quadrilateral opening, bounded above by the sub- scapularis and teres minor, below by the teres major, externally by the neck of the humerus, and internally by the long head of the triceps (p. 229). Its branches terminate on the under surface of the deltoid, anastomosing with the anterior circumflex, acromial thoracic, and supra-scapular arteries. From the posterior circumflex, a branch descends in the sub- stance of the long head of the triceps, to inosculate with the superior profunda; this is one of the channels through which the circulation would be carried on, if the axillary wei^ tied in the last part of its course. Circumflex ^ ^'''''"'^ Â°^ posterior cord of the nerve. axillary plexus, runs with the posterior circumflex artery. It sends a branch to the teres minor, one or two to the integuments of the shoulder, and terminates in the substance of the deltoid. The proximity of this nerve to the head ot the humerus explains the occasional paralysis of the deltoid after dislocation or fracture of the humerus. The nerve is apt to' be injured, if not actually lacerated by the pressure of the bone.

DISSECTiON OF THE JiARYNX. 163 extend between the extremities of the greater corniia of the os- hyoides and the ascending cornua of the thyroid cartilage. They often contain a little nodule of cartilage. Cartiia.es of T-^" ^'^"^^"^"'^ the krynx is composed of five the larynx, cartilages Connected by joints and elastic ligaments, so that they can be moved upon each other by appropriate muscles ; the object of this motion being to act upon two elastic ligaments called the 'vocal cords,' upon which the voice essentially depends. Thyroid car ^ 7^'" ''^'^^'^^S^' ^^^l^d because it shields the beauti- tiiage. f^^l mechanism behind it,* consists of two lateral halves (alee) united at an acute angle in front, which forms the prominence termed ' Pomuvi AclamV This prominence pre^ sents a notch at its upper part, to allow it to play behind the os^ hyoides m deglutition. There is a bursa in front of it. I have seen this bursa as large as a pigeon's egg. The outer surface of each ala is marked by an obHque line passing downwards and for- wards from the upper cornu, which gives attachment to the sterno-thyroid and thyro-hyoid muscles. The inferior border is slightly arched in the middle, and on either side presents a convex prominence, which gives attachment to the crico-thyroid muscle The supe7'^or border is nearly horizontal. The posterior border IS nearly vertical, and gives insertion to the stylo-pharyngeus and pa ato-pharyngeus muscles. This border terminates above and below m round projections called the upper and lower cornua. I he upper is the longer; the lower articulates with the side of the cricoid cartilage. Cricoid . ^^^"^^^^g'^' earned from its resemblance to a cartilage. "^g't IS Situated below the thyroid. It is not of equal depth all round. It is narrow in front, where it may be felt about one quarter of an inch below the thyroid : from this part, the upper border gradually rises, so that, posteriorly, the interval left between the al« of the thyroid.

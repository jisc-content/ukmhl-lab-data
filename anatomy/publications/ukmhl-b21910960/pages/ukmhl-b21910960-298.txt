282 DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE KOHEAUM. osseous and radial nerves. A small branch of this nerve, wliich passes through the substance of the triceps to supply the anconeus, must be made out. The cutaneous branches of tlie musculo-spiral nerve have been already dissected (p. 233). DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE FOEEAKM. Eemove the skin from the back of the forearm, hand, and fingers. Observe the subcutaneous bursa over the olecranon. It is com- monly of considerable size, and, if distended, would appear nearly as large as a walnut. Another bursa is sometimes found a little lower down upon the ulna. A subcutaneous bursa is generally placed over the internal condyle, another over the external. A bursa is also situated over the styloid process of the ulna; this sometimes communicates with the sheath of the extensor carpi ulnaris. Small bursas are sometimes developed in the cellular tissue over each of the knuckles. The cutaneous veins from the back of the hand and forearm join the venous plexus at the bend of the elbow (see p. 234). They are the external cutaneous branches of the Cutaneous musculo-spiral, branches of the internal cutaneous, nerves of the ^ ' ' back of the and of the external cutaneous. The greater number forearm and qÂ£ ^^xe^^ nerves may be traced down to the back of the wrist. The skin on the back of the hand is united to the subjacent tendons by an abundance of loose connective tissue, in which we find large veins, and branches of the radial and ulnar nerves. The dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve passes beneath the ten- don of the flexor carpi ulnaris, over the internal lateral liga- ment of the wrist; and divides upon the back of the hand into filaments, which supply the back of the little finger, the ring finger, and the ulnar side of the middle finger. The radial nerve passes obliquely beneath the tendon of the supinator longus, and subdivides into branches, which supply both sides of the back of

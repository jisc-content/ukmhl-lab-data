The arteries of the gland are derived from the long thoracic and internal mammary: the nerves come from the anter or and lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves. DISSECTION OF THE SCROTUM AND TESTIS. The scrotum is composed of six tunics:â€”1. The thrs^Xi 2- dartos; 3. A layer ot cellular tissue; 4. The spermatic fascia derived from the ex- ternal abdominal ring; 5. The cremaster, or suspensory muscle; 6. The infundibuliform fascia derived from the internal ring. Each of these coverings cannot be demonstrated under ordinary circumstances, because they are so blended together; but they can be shown in the case of old and large herniae when in a state of hypertrophy. The dartos is a thin layer consisting: of muscular Dartos fibres of the non-striped kind, like those of the bladder and intestines. Its use is to corrugate the loose and extensible skin of the scrotum, and in a measure to support and brace the testicle. Beneath the dartos is a large quantity of loose eel- Layer of ^ T P e cellular lular tissue, remarkable for the total absence of fat. tissue. Together with the dartos, it forms a vertical partition between the testicles, termed ' septum scrotV It is not a complete partition, since air or fluid will pass from one side to the other. The great abundance and looseness of this tissue explains the enormous swelling of the scrotum in cases of anasarca, and in cases where the urine is effused into it in consequence of rupture or ulceration of the urethra. The spermatic fascia, cremaster muscle, and infundibuliform fascia have been described (pp. 318, 321).

100 SYMPATHETIC NERVE IN THE NECK. c. With the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cerebral nerves (in the cavernous sinus). cl With the several ganglia of the sympathetic system about the head and neck ; namely, the ophthalmic, spheno-palatine, otic, and submaxillary. The branches which it distributes are— e. Nerves to the heart—One or more descend behind the sheath of the carotid, and entering the chest, join the cardiac plexuses, superficial and deep. /. Nerves to the pharynx.—These join the pharyngeal plexus on the middle constrictor of the pharynx. g. Nerves to the blood-vessels.—These nerves, named on account of their delicacy ' nervi molles,' ramify around the external carotid artery and its branches. The middle cervical ganglion is something less than a barley- corn in size. It is situated behind the carotid sheath, about the fifth or sixth cervical vertebra, near the inferior thyroid artery. It receives branches from the fifth and sixth spinal nerves, and gives oif— a. Branches to the thyroid body.—These accompany the inferior thyroid artery. b. Branch to the heart—This usually descends in front of the subclavian artery into the chest, and joins the deep cardiac plexus. In cases where the middle cervical ganglion is absent, the pre- ceding nerves are supplied by the sympathetic cord connecting the superior and inferior ganglia. The inferior cervical ganglion is of considerable size, and is situated in the interval between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the first rib, immediately behind the vertebral artery. It receives branches from the seventh and eighth spinal nerves, and others which, descending from the fourth, fifth, and sixth, through the foramina in the transverse processes of the vertebrae, form a plexus around the vertebral artery. The branches which it gives off are—

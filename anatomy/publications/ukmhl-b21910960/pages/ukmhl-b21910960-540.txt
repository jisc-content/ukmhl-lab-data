These are the eruo^a cerebri. Winding round the outer side of each crus is a soft white band, the ' tractU8 opticus; or root of the optic nerve. Fig. 123. 1. Olfactory n. 2. Optic n. 3.

Origin op '^^^ cerebral nerves are given off in pairs, named THE cBHBBRAx thc first, sccond, third, &c., according to the order in NERVES. -which they appear, beginning from the front. There are nine pairs. Some are nerves of special sense—as the olfactory, the optic, the auditory; others are nerves of common sensation— as the large root of the fifth, the glosso-pharyngeal, and the pneumo- gastric; others, again, are nerves of motion—as the third, the fourth, the small root of the fifth, the sixth, the facial division of the seventh, the spinal accessory, and the ninth. ^ The olfactory nerve is triangular, and fits into a First pair or . olfactory furrow between the convolutions. It proceeds straight nerve. forwards under the anterior lobe, and terminates in I

LIGAMENTS OF THE LOWER JAW. 216 The costal cartilages from the sixth to the tenth are connected by ligamentous fibres. Articulation '^^'^ condyle of the lower jaw articulates with the of the lower glenoid cavity of the temporal bone. The joint is provided with an inter-articular fibro-cartilage, and with external and internal lateral ligaments (fig. 45). Fig. 46. Section through the glenoid cavity Inter-artioular fibro-cartilage Internal lateral ligament TBANSrERSE SECTION TO SHOW THE LIGAMENTS AND THE FIBRO-CAETILAGE OF THE JOINT OF THE LOWER JAW. THE DOTTED LINES EEPEESENT THE TWO SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES. The external lateral ligament extends from the tubercle of the zygoma downwards and backwards to the tubercle of the condyle of the jaw. The internal lateral ligament extends from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone to the border of the dental foramen. This Â«so-called' ligament cannot in any way contribute to the strength of the joint: the articulation of one side performs the office of internal lateral ligament to the other.

The phrenic, for the supply of the diaphragm. 2. The cceliac axis, a short thick trunk which immediately subdivides into three branches for the supply of the stomach, the liver, and the spleen. 3. The superior mesenteric, for the supply of all the small in- testines and the upper half of the large. 4. 5. The supra-renal and the renal arteries. 6. The spermatic, for the testicles in the male, and the ovaries in the female. 7. The inferior mesenteric, for the supply of the lower half of the large intestine. 8. The lumbar, a series of branches, analogous to the intercostals, for the supply of the back part of the abdomen. 9. The arteria sacra media, which is given off at the bifurca- tion of the aorta, and runs down in front of the sacrum. These branches are to be traced throughout in the order most convenient. Take the caeliac axis first. To dissect this artery and its branches, the liver must be well raised, as in fig. 67, and a layer of peritoneum removed from the gastro-hepatic omentum. There is a close network of very tough tissue about all the visceral branches of the aorta. This tissue consists almost entirely of plexuses of nerves, derived from the sympathetic system. Of these plexuses, the largest surrounds the cseliac axis like a ring. This is the solar plexus, or more appropriately, the brain of the abdomen, and is formed by the junction of the two semi-lunar ganglia (see dissection of thorax, p. 126). From this, as from a root, other secondary plexuses branch ofi", and surround the following arteries:â€”the jjhrenic, coronary, hepatic, splenic, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric, and renal: the plexus receiving the name of the arteries around which they twine. It requires a very lean subject, and great anatomical dexterity to trace them.

308 THE ABDOMEN. DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. Eig. 68. Arbitrary divide the abdomen into arbitrary regions, that division into the situation of the viscera contained in it may be more regions. easily described. For this purpose we draw the fol- lowing imaginary lines: one horizontal across the abdomen on a level with the cartilages of the ninth ribs; another on a level with the anterior spines of the ilia. These lines form the boundaries of three spaces, each of which is sub- divided into three regions by a vertical line drawn on each side from the carti- lage of the eighth rib to the middle of Poupart's ligament. Thus, we have a central and two lateral regions in each space. The central region of the upper space is termed the epigastric or scro- biculus cordis, the central one of the middle space is called the umbilical region, and the central of the inferior space, the hypogastric region. The lateral regions of the spaces from above downwards are termed the right and left hypochondriac, the right and left lumbar, and the right and left inguinal or iliac regions, respectively. The abdomen should be distended with air, by means of a blow- pipe inserted into the abdominal cavity at the umbilicus. An incision should be made from the sternum to the pubes, another from the anterior spine of the ilium to a point midway between the umbilicus and pubes, and a third from the ensiform cartilage, transversely outwards towards the axilla as far as the

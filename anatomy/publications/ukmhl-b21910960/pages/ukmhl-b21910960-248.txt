DISSECTION OF THE UPPER ARAL 232 cutaneous, and the outer head of the median ; from tlie inner coi-d, another anterior thoracic nerve, the inner head of the median, the ulnar, the internal, and the lesser internal cutaneous. From the posterior cord, the three suhscapular nerves, the circumflex and the musculo-spiral. The anterior thoracic nerves have been described (p. 222). Subscapular The three 'subscapular^ nerves are found .on the nerves. sm'face of the subscapularis. They come from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, and supply respectively the latissimus dorsi, teres major, and subscapularis. The nerve for the latissimus dorsi (called the long subscapular nerve) runs with the anterior branch of the subscapular artery. The nerve for the teres major is either a branch of the preceding, or comes distinct from the plexus. It lies nearer to the humerus than the long subscapular, and after supplying a branch to the latissimus dorsi, terminates in the teres major. The proper nerve of tJie subscapularis arises from the plexus higher than the others. Circumflex The posterior circumflex artery is accompanied by nerve, the circumflex nerve whidh supplies the deltoid. This large nerve comes from the posterior part of the brachial plexus, in common with the musculo-spiral and subscapular nerves, and, after sending a branch to the teres minor, terminates in the under surface of the deltoid. The nerve supplies the skin covering the deltoid by branches which turn round the posterior border of the muscle; other branches are distributed to the skin over the long head of the triceps. DISSECTION OF THE UPPER AEM. Let the incision be continued down the inner side of the arm as far as two inches below the elbow. Reflect the skin, and trace the following cutaneous nerves. Cutaneous The filaments of the intercosto-humeral nei-ves run nerves. down the inner and posterior part of the arm, to the

214 LIGAMENTS CONNECTING THE HEAD TO THE SPINE. Ligiiments between the occipital bone and the axis. These are the most important; and to see them, the spinal canal must be exposed by removing the arches of the upper cervical vertebrae, and the posterior com- mon ligament, which is here very thick and strong. It descends from the basilar process of the occipital bone over the odontoid and transverse h'gaments. The odontoid or check ligfaments (fig. 44) are two Odontoid T-i iP i 'j or check very strong ligaments which proceed from the sides oi ligaments, ^j^g odontoid process to the tubercles on the inner sides of the condyles of the occiput. Their use is to limit the rotation of the head. A third or middle odontoid ligament passes from Fig. 44. POST?

The odontoid process of the axis forms a pivot upon which the head and atlas rotate. The most important ligament is the transverse (fig. 44). It passes behind the odontoid process, and is attached to the tubercles on the inner side of the articular processes of the atlas. From the centre of this ligament a few fibres pass upwards, and Articula- tion be- tween the atlas and the axis.

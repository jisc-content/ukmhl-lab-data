PECTORAL REGION. 221 In the space now before us are the great vessels and Suon'ofthe' ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^ part of their course, axillary They lie at a great depth from the surface. They nei-^i! """"^ ^^'^ surrounded by a sheath of fascia, which descends with them beneath the clavicle, and are situated with regard to each other in the following manner. The axillary vein lies in front of the artery, and rather to its thoracic side. The axillary (brachial) plexus of nerves is situated above the artery, and on a posterior plane. The plexus consists of two, or some- times three large cords, which result from the union of the an- terior branches of the last four cervical and the first dorsal. Thoracic This is the first branch of the axillary artery. It axis. comes off above the pectoralis minor, and soon divides into three branches—the superior or short thoracic, the thoracica humeraria, and the thoracica acromialis. The superior or short thoracic runs between the pectoralis major and minor, supplying ramifications to both, and anastomosing with the intercostal and internal mammary arteries. The thoracica humeraria descends with the cephalic vein, in the interval between the pectoralis maj or and deltoid, and ramifies in both. The thoracica acromialis passes over the coracoid process to the under surface of the deltoid, which it supplies, and communicates with the circumflex branches of the axillary. All these arteries are accompanied by veins which most frequently empty themselves into tlae cephalic, but occasionally into the axillary vein itself. Cephalic The cephalic vein is one of the principal cutaneous ^^"1- veins of the arm. Commencing on the back of the thumb and forefinger, it runs up the radial side of the forearm, over the front of the elbow-joint; thence ascending along the outer edge of the biceps, it runs up the interval between the pectoraHs major and deltoid, pierces the costo-coracoid fascia, and finally empties itself into the axillary vein.* julu!r\?ttre T"'," """^ ''^""'^'^ '° -^--1 rebs ^ communication (termed jugiilo-cephalic) between these

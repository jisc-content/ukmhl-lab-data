PARTS CONCERNED IN FEMORAL HERNIA. 447 genito-crural nerve. These muscles and vessels fill up the space beneath the crural arch, except on the inner side of the femoral vein, where a comparatively vacant space is left for the passage of the absorbents: this is called the crural canal. The muscles are separated from the vessels by a strong vertical fibrous partition passing from the arch to the bone, which is nothing more than a continuation of the sheath of the psoas. The artery, too, is sepa- rated from the vein by a similar, although a much weaker parti- Kg. 100 External cutaneons n. . lUacns , . . , Anterior crural n. Psoas Crural arch. External ring.

These three partitions not only keep all the parts in their right place, but confine the arch down to the bone, and prevent its being uplifted by any protrusion between it and the muscles and vessels. This, coupled with the close attachment of the iliac fascia to the crural arch, explains why a femoral hernia rarely takes place in any other situation than on the inner side of the femoral vein.* * If the partitions from any cause yield, or become slack, tlien a rupture may de- scend in front of the vessels, or even (though this is rare) on the outer side of the artery.

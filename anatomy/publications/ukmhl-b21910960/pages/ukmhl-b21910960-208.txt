192 DISSECTION OF EIGHTH PAIR OF NERVES OF SKULL. DISSECTION OF THE EIGHTH PAIR OF NERVES AT THE BASE OF THE SKULL. In this dissection we propose to examine the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory nerves in the jugular fossa, and the ganglia and nerves belonging to them in this part of their Fig. 43. DIAGRAM OF THE EIGHTH PAIR OF NERVES AT THE BASE OF THE SKtTLL. 1. Facial nerve. 2. Glosso-pharyngeal u. 3. Pneumogastric. 4. Spinal accessory. 5. Jacobson's or tympanic nerve, 6. Lesser petrosal. 7. Great petrosal branch, or Videan. 8. Branch to Eustachian tube. 9. Arnold's or auricular u. course. These are difficult to trace, and cannot be followed out with success unless the nerves have been previously hardened by 10. Spheno-palatine or Meckel's ganglion. 11. otic ganglion. 12.

VENA POKTiE. 339 Fig. 68. It gives off: 1. Several small branches to the pancreas, pan- creaticce parvce. One, rather larger than the rest, which ac- companies the pancreatic duct, is called pancreatica magna. 2. The gastro-epiploica sinistra, which runs to the right along the great curve of the stomach, and inosculates with the gastro-epiploica dextra. 3. Vasa brevia, which proceed between the layers of the gastro-splenic omentum, to the great end of the stomach, where they communicate with branches . from the coronaria ven- triculi. Thus the stomach is sup- plied with blood by four channels, which by their inosculations form a main artery along its lesser curve, another along its greater; from these, numerous bran- ches are furnished to both sides of the stomach. The artery of the greater curve also sends down numerous branches to the omentum, which form a beautiful net- work between its layers. The advantage of this free in- osculation of arteries about the stomach must be apparent. Venaportse: The Veins which return the blood from the abdomi- HaS: ^ Â°f alimentary canal, the pancreas, and the spleen, have this peculiarity, that they do not empty themselves into the vena cava, but all unite into one great vein, called the ' vena portse,' which ramifies throughout the liver, and DIAGEAM OF THE VENA TOBT^. (The arrow is introduced behind the free border of the lesser omentum.)

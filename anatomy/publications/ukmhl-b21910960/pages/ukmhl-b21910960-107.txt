INFEKIOU MAXILLARY NERVE. 91 motor as well as sensitive filaineuts ; others are purely sensitive, as follow :— BRANCHES OF THE INEERIOE MAXILLARY NERVE. Branches of common Sensation. Beanches Motor. Tomporo-auricular. To temporal muscle. Inferior dental. — masseter. Buccal. ' — external pterygoid. ^ Gustatory. — internal pterygoid. — tensor palati. — mylo-hyoideus. — anterior belly of digastricus. The branches to the temporal muscle, two in number, pass outwards close to the great wing of the sphenoid bone, and ascend with the temporal arteries to the muscle. The branch to the masseter runs outwards above the external pterygoid, through the sigmoid notch of the jaw. The branch to the external ^pterygoid comes apparently from the buccal nerve in its passage through this muscle. The branch to the internal ^pterygoid and tensor palati muscles is rather difficult to find. It proceeds from the inner side of the main trunk, close to the otic ganglion, and descends between the internal pterygoid and the tensor palati, supplying them both. The buccal branch passes either above or between the fibres of the external pterygoid to the buccinator, where it spreads out into filaments, which supply the skin, mucous membrane, and glands of the cheek with common sensation. The motor power of the buccinator, remember, is derived from the facial nerve. That this buccal branch is purely sensory is proved by the action of the muscle still continuing when the motor division of the fifth nerve is paralysed. The evidence is corroborated by a case in which this buccal branch proceeded from the second division of the fifth nerve ; no communication being discovered, after very careful dis- section, between it and the motor root of the third division.* * Turner ' On the variation of the buccal nerve.'

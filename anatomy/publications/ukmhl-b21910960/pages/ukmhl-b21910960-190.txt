174 DISSECTION OF THE TONGUE. Fig. 38. The papillce fungiformce, smaller and more numerous than the clrcumvallatce, are scattered chiefly over the sides and tip of the tongue, and sparingly over its upper surface. They vary in shape, some being cyliudrical, others having heads like mush- rooms ; whence their name. Near the apex of the tongue they may be distinguished during life from the other papillae by their redder colour. In scarlatina, and some ex- antheraatous fevers, these papillae become elongated, and of a bright red colour: as the fever subsides, their points acquire a brown- ish tint; giving rise to what is called ' the I strawberry tongue.' The papilla} filiformce are the smallest and most numerous. They are so closely a.ggregated that they give the tongue a velvet- like appearance. Their points are directed backwards, so that the tongue feels smooth, if the finger be passed over it from apex to base ; but rough, if in the contrary direction. Iliese papillae consist of small conical processes arranged for the most part in a series of lines running parallel to the two rows of the papillae circumvallatae. Each papilla is covered with a thick layer of epithelium, which is prolonged into a number of free hair- like processes. If the papillae be injected, and examined under the microscope, it is found that they are not simple elevations, like those of the skin, but that from them arise secondary papillae. The ' papillae ciicumvallatae' consist of an aggregation of smaller papilte arranged parallel to each other; and the papillae fungiformae consist of cen- tral stems from which minute secondary papillae shoot off. This elaborate structure escapes observation because it is buried beneath the epithelium.* Each secondary papilla receives a blood-vessel, which passes nearly to its apex, and returns in a loop-like manner. * See Bowman and Todd's ' Physiological Anatoinj-.' 1.

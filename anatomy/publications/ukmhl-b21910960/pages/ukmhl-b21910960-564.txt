548 SPINAL CORD. is a transverse layer of white substance, named the aniemor com- missure, connecting the two anterior halves of the cord. The 'posterior fissure is so much less apparent than the anterior, that some anatomists altogether deny its existence; but it can be demonstrated by careful preparation, and, indeed, penetrates to a greater depth than the anterior, so that it reaches down to the grey matter in the centre of the cord. Besides the anterior and posterior fissures, along each half of the cord are two superficial grooves, from which the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves respectively emerge. These are the anterior and posterior lateral grooves. The posterior Fig. 131. 1. Dura mater. 2. Araclinoid mem- brane. 3. Ganglion on poBte- rior root of spinal nerve. 4.

By these lateral Columns. gj.o(,^es each half of the cord is divided into three longitudinal columnsâ€”an anterior, a postenor, and a lateral. The anterior are motor columns, the posterior sensitive, the lateral probably contain both motor and sensitive filaments.

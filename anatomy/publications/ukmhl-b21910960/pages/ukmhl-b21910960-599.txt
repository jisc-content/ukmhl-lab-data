They serve to maintain the general shape of the testicle, to support the numerous lobules of which its glandular substance is composed, and to convey the blood vessels into it. These tie-beams {trabeculce testis), as well as the mediastinum from which they proceed, are readily seen on making a transverse section through the gland (fig. 138). Eespecting the so-called tunica vasculosa, nothing more need be said than that it consists of a multitude of fine blood vessels, formed by the ramifications of the spermatic artery, and held together by delicate cellular tissue. It lines the inner surface of the tunica albuginea, and gives off vessels which run with the fibrous cords into the interior of the gland. When the testicle is cut into, its interior looks soft and pulpy, and of a reddish- grey colour. It consists of an innume- rable multitude of minute convoluted tubes (tubuli seminiferi). For eco- nomy of space they are arranged in lobules, between four and five hundred * in number, of various sizes, and contained in the compartments formed by the fibrous cords proceeding from the mediastinum testis. Only a few of these lobules are shown in diagram 138. Though disposed in lobules, still they communicate with each other, and thus form one vast network of tubes. The secretion from them is carried oflf by some forty or fifty straight vessels {vasa recta), which penetrate the mediastinum testis, and there form a plexus of seminal tubes, termed the ' rete testis.' This lies Grlandular structure. TRANSVEESE SECTION THROUGH THE TESTICLE. (Diagrammatic.) 1. Spermatic artery. 2. Vaa deferens. 3. Deferential artery. 4. Epididymis. 5. Mediastinnm testis. 6. 6.

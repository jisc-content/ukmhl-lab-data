362 MALE PERINEUM. peritoneal pouch on the front part of the bladder, which is only produced when the bladder is distended. To produce it, the bladder should be blown up through one of the ureters. It soon fills the pelvis, and then, rising into the abdomen, occasions the pouch in question between it and the abdominal wall. At first, the pouch is shallow, but it gradually deepens as the bladder rises. Now, if the bladder be distended half way up to the umbilicus, which is commonly the case when it has to be tapped, we find that the bottom of the poucli would be about two inches from the sym- physis pubis (fig. 73). Within this distance from the symphysis, the bladder may be taj)ped in the linea alba, without risk of wounding the peritoneum. Thus, the surgeon has the choice of two situations in which he may tap the bladder—above the pubes, or from the rectum. Which of the two be the more appropriate, must be decided by the circumstances of the case. DISSECTION 0¥ THE MALE PEEINEUM. Before dissecting the perineum, it is expedient first to examine the osseous and ligamentous boundaries of the lower aperture of the pelvis. Looking at the male pelvis (with the ligaments preserved), we ob- serve that this apertiire is of a lozenge shape; that it is bounded in front by the symphysis of the pubes, laterally by the rami of the pubes and ischium; be- hind, by the coccyx and the great sacro- ischiatic ligaments. This space, for convenience of descrip- tion, we divide into two by an imaginary line drawn from one tuber ischii to the other. The anterior forms a nearly eqvii- lateral triangle, of which the sides are from three to three and a half inches long; and since it trans- mits the urethra, it is called the urethral divison of the perineum.

■ METACAKrAL JOINTS. Carpo- The metacarpal bones of the fingers are connected to Str''' *!^' ''''''^ ^^'•P^l bones by ligaments upon their palmar and dorsal surfaces. The dorsal ligaments are the stronger. The metacarpal bone ot the fore-finger has two ; one from the trapezium, another from the trapezoid bone. That of the middle finger has also two, pro- ceeding from the os magnum, and the os trapezoides.

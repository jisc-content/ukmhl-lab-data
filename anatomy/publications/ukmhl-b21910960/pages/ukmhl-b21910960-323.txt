JOINTS OF THE FINGERS. 307 either side it is inseparably connected with the lateral ligaments, so that with them it forms a strong capsule over the front and sides of tlie joint. Its superficial surface is slightly grooved, to receive the flexor tendons ; its deep surface is adapted to cover the head of the metacarpal bone. Two sesamoid bones are found in the glenoid ligament belonging to the joint between the metacarpal bone and the first phalanx of the thumb. The glenoid ligaments have a surgical importance for the follow- ing reason :â€”In dislocation of the fingers, the facility of reduction mainly depends upon the extent to which the glenoid ligament is injured. If it be much torn there is but little difficulty : if entire, the reduction is tedious and sometimes impracticable. These joints are secured on their dorsal aspect by the extensor tendon, and the expansion proceeding from it on either side. Their synovial membranes are loose, especially beneath the extensor tendons. Second and "^^^ corresponding articular surfaces of the phalanges LAST JOINT of the fingers and thumb are so shaped as to form a ^G^s. tinge-joint, and, therefore, incapable of lateral move- ment. The ligaments connecting them are similar in every respect to those between the metacarpal bones and the first phalanges. The glenoid ligament of the last joint of the thumb generally contains a sesamoid bone.

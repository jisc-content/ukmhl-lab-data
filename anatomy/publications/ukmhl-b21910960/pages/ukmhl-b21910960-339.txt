323 PAllTS CONCERNED IN INGUINAL HERNIA. inguinal canal, it is called an incomplete inguinal hernia; such an one is generally of small size, and sometimes difficult of detec- tion. Lastly, if a portion of intestine escape at once through the external ring, then it is called an internal or direct inguinal hernia. Cowrino-s of oblique inguinal hernia has all the coverings of the different the cord. Beneath the skin, therefore, and the sub- hemise. cutaneous tissue there will be— 1. The spermatic fascia, derived from the aponeurosis of the external oblique. 2. The cremaster muscle, derived from the internal oblique and transversalis. 3. The infundibuliform fascia, derived from the fascia trans- versalis. The incomplete inguinal hernia will be covered by 1. The aponeurosis of the external oblique. 2. The cremaster. 3. The infundibuliform fascia. The direct inguinal hernia will be covered by— 1. The spermatic fascia. 2. The fascia transversalis.* In all cases, or at any rate with very few exceptions, the im- mediate investment of the intestine is the peritoneum. This con- stitutes the sac of the hernia. The opening of the sac, communi- cating with the abdomen, is called its mouth, then comes the neck, and, lastly, the body or expanded part of the sac. Congenital ^"^^ ^^0 Varieties of oblique inguinal hernia, hern^f''''^^^ termed the ' congenital' and the 'infantile,' to which a passing allusion must be made. The congenital] * mat becomes, it may be asked, of the fibres of the conjoined tendon of the in- ternal oblique and transversalis ? They are either protruded before the peritoneum, or permit the hernia to slip between them. t The term ' congenital' applied to this form of hernia is apt to suggest the idea that It occurs at birth. But this is not of necessity so. Although the state of parts favourable to its occurrence exists at birth, the hernia itself may not take place till many years afterwards j in fact, at any period of life. Y 2

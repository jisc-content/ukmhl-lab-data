DISSECTION or THE UPPEK ARM. 239 Observe particularly that the artery is more or less overlapped, in the first part of its course, by the coraco-brachialis, lower down by the fleshy belly of the biceps; these muscles in their respective situations are the best guides to the artery. About the middle of the humerus, the artery lies for nearly two inches on the tendon of the coraco-brachialis, and is so close to the bone that it can be effectually compressed; here, too, it is crossed by the median nerve. ' At the bend of the elbow the artery is protected by the semi- lunar fascia from the tendon of the biceps. It enters a triangular space, bounded by the pronator radii teres internally, and by the supmator radii longus externally. It sinks into this space, with the tendon of the biceps to its outer side, and the median nerve to Its mner; all three rest upon the brachialis anticus. Opposite the coronoid process of the ulna it divides into the radial and ulnar arteries. Two veins, of which the internal is the larger, lie in close con- tact with the brachial artery, and communicate at frequent inter- vals by transverse branches. Branches of ^he brachial artery gives ofif three branches, which brachial arise from its inner side; namely, the superior pro- funda, the inferior profunda, and the anastomotica magna. It also gives ofif muscular branches to the coraco-brachi- alis and biceps. The profunda superior arises from the brachial artery, immedi- ately below the tendon of the teres major.* It winds round the posterior part of the humerus, between the outer and inner heads of the triceps with the musculo-spiral nerve (p. 229), and a little above the middle of the arm divides into two branches, which run for some distance on either side of the nerve. One of these runs m the substance of the triceps muscle to the olecranon, and anasto- rnoses with the ulnar recurrent, the interosseous recurrent, and anastomotica magna arteries; the other branch accompanies the the^a\l'I^d7r«f 1*'' ""'""^ '^l'^ "^"^^ f^^'^^' 1°°^ the tendon of trunk °^^ --^^

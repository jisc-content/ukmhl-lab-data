473 GLUTiEAL REGION. the peroneus longus, you will find that this nerve runs round the outer side of the fibula immediately below its head. Here it divides into several branches, as follow:—1. Three articular branches to the knee-joint, which pass in with the external articular arteries, and the tibial recurrent artery; 2. The anterior tibial, which accompanies the corresponding artery ; 3. The external cutaneous (p. 467), which comes through the fascia between the peroneus longus and the extensor longus digitorum; 4. Branches which supply aU the muscles in front of the leg, namely, the extensors of the foot and the toes and the peronei. DISSECTION OF THE GLUTEAL EEGION. The body having been placed on its face, rotate the thighs inwards as much as possible, and cross them. The incision through the skin should commence at the coccyx, and be continued in a semicircular manner along the crest of the ileum. Another incision should be made from the coccyx down- wards and outwards for about six inches below the great trochanter. In reflecting the skin, notice the thick cushion which the sub- cutaneous adipose tissue forms over the tuberosity of the ischium. I have often seen a large bursa between the cushion and the bone. These are derived from several sources. The pos- MTves!°^^ terior divisions of the first and second lumbar nerves descend over the crest of the ileum, near the origin of the erector spinae, to supply the skin over the glutseus maximus. Internal to these, are the posterior branches of the sacral nerves, which are distributed to the integument over the sacrum and coccyx. Over the middle of the crest come the lateral branches of the twelfth dorsal, and internal to it, the iliac branch of the ilio- hypogastric. Other cutaneous nerves come up from below; they are branches of the lesser ischiatic, and proceed from beneath the lower border of the glutseus maximus. Lastly, some branches

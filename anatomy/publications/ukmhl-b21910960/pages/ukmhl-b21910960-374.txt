LUMBAR PLEXUS. 358 The anterior crural (cZ), the largest and most important branch, is generally formed by the union of the third and fourth lumbar. It descends in a groove between the psoas and the iliacus, supplies both these muscles, and then, passing under the crural arch, is finally distributed to the extensor muscles, to the sartorius and pectineus, and the skin of the thigh. The obturator nerve (/) is next in size to the anterior criiral. It proceeds from tbe third and fourth lumbar nerves, descends along the brim of the pelvis to the obturator foramen, and is dis- tributed to the adductor muscles of the thigh. The accessory obturator nerve is by no means a constant branch, but when present, comes from the obturator or third and foiu-th lumbar nerves. It descends over the horizontal ramus of the pubes, and supplies the pectineus on its under aspect.

188 SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. glion (fig. 42), it leaves the skull through the foramen rotundum, passes horizontally forwards across the spheno-maxillary fossa, enters the infra-orbital canal with the corresponding artery, and finally emerges upon the face, through the infra-orbital foramen, beneath the levator labii superioris. The branches given ofif are: — a. The orbital branch already described (p. 187). 6. Two branches to the spheno-palatine ganglion (Meckel's), situated in the spheno-maxillary fossa. c. Posterior dental branches, two or three. They descend along the back part of the superior maxillary bone, and divide into Fig. 42. Trunk of the fifth nerve . Gasserian gan- glion . . . Facial n. . .

They also supply the gums, and the lining membrane of the antrum. d. Anterior dental branch.—This arises just before the nerve emerges from the infra-orbital foramen. It descends in a special canal in the anterior wall of the upper jaw, and gives filaments to

486 CALF OF THE LEG. saphenous nerve; some branches, however, from the long saphenous and small ischiatic nerves, are to be traced, ramifying in the sub- cutaneous tissue of the inner and upper part of the leg. The external saphenous nerve * is derived from the p(Sr'im-Â°'' popliteal (fig. 106), and passes down between the two saphenous heads of the gastrocnemius to the middle of the calf, where it comes through the fascia. Here it is joined b}' a branch from the peroneal nerve {communicans peronei); it then descends with the saphenous vein, and is finally distributed to the outer side of the foot and the little toe. To expose the muscles of the calf, reflect the muscular fascia by iucisions corresponding to those made through the skin. The great flexor muscle of the foot consists of two Muscles of portions : the superficial one, called the' gastrocnemius,' THE CALF. J- 1 n 1 r ^1 J arises from the lower end of the femur; the deep one,^ called the ' soleus,' arises from the tibia and fibula. The force of both is concentrated on one thick tendon, called the ' tendo Achillis,' which is inserted into the heel. This muscle arises by two strong tendinous heads, Gastrocnemius. ^^^^^ ^^^^^ p^^.^ ^^^^ condyle of the femur (fig. 106). The inner head is the larger. The two parts of the muscle descend, distinct from each other, and form the two bellies of the calf, of which the inner is rather the lower. Both terminate, rather below the middle of the leg, on the broad com- mencement of the tendo Achillis. The gastrocnemius should be divided transversely near its insertion, and reflected upwards from the subjacent soleus, as high as its origin. By this proceeding you observe that tlie contiguous surfaces of the muscles are covered by a glistening tendon, which receives the insertion of their fibres, and transmits their collected force to the tendo Achillis. Observe also the large sural vessels and nerves (branches of the popliteal) which supply each head of the muscle. To facilitate the play of the inner tendon over the condyle, there is a bursa, which * This nerve is sometimes called the communicans poplitei, and does not take the name of external saphenous till its junction witli the communicans peronei.

It does this by depressing the thyroid cartilage : for this cartilage cannot be depressed without lengthening these cords, as shown by the dotted line, fig. 35. Its nerve is the external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal. M. erico- "^^^^ muscle arises from the posterior part of the arj'tenoideus Cricoid cartilage: its fibres pass outwards and upwards posticus. j^^j i^^Q external tubercle of the ary- tenoid. Its action is to dilate the glottis. It does this by drawing the posterior tubercle of the arytenoid cartilage towards the Fig. 36.

In this movement the arytenoid cartilage rotates as upon a pivot, and acts as a lever of the first order ; the fulcrum or ideal pivot being intermediate between the power and the weight. This muscle dilates the glottis every time we inspire. Its nerve comes from the inferior laryngeal. M. aryte- "^^^^ muscle occupies the interval between the noideus. back of the arytenoid cartilages. The fibres pass across from one cartilage to the other. Most of them are transverse, but some cross like the letter X, running from the

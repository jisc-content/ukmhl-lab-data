530 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. The anterior part of the corpus callosum turns downwards and backwards, forming a bend called its genu, or knee. The inferior part (rostrum) of this bend becomes gradually thinner, and termi- nates in two peduncles, which diverge from each other, and are lost, one in each fissure of Sylvius. Between these crura is placed the lamina cinerea (fig. 125). The posterior part of the corpus callosum terminates in a thick, round border, beneath which the Fig. 126. Toramen of Monro .

A satisfactory view cannot be obtained of the arch formed by the corpus callo- sum, of its terminations in front and behind, and of the relative thickness of its different parts, without making a perpendicular section through a fresh brain, as shown in the diagram.* * The corpus calloaum is more or less developed in all mammalia, but is absent in birds, reptiles, and fish. It is not absolutely essential to the exercise of the intellect,

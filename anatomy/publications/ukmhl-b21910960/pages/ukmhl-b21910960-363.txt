Ka;. 71. serve that the inner fibres of each cross each other in front of the aorta, somewhat like the letter X.* Just above the crossing, and a little towards the left side of it, is the oesophageal opening; this is entirely muscular, and transmits the oesophagus and the pneumo- gastric nerves. The opening for the vena cava is situated in the central tendon, rather to the right of the middle line: observe that the vein is in- timately connected to its margin, so that it may be kept permanently open. Lastly, there pass through the crus, on each side, the sympathetic, the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves. The nerves of the dia- phragm are the phrenic . (p. Ill), and the five or six lower intercostal nerves on each side. Its blood vessels are the two phrenic, derived from the aorta, the internal mammary (p. 103), and the lower intercostal. The diaphragm is the great muscle concerned in in- spiration. Truly it may be said with Haller, that it is ' musculus post cor nobilissimus.' During inspiration the muscular sides of the diaphragm contract, and become less arched (as shown by the dotted line in fig. 71); the floor of the chest smks in consequence, and more room is made for the expansion of the lungs. During expiration the diaphragm relaxes, and the air is expelled partly by the elasticity of the lungs and the thoracic walls; partly by muscular action. This alternate falling and rising * This decussation is not invariable. But the right crus always crosses more or less over the left, so that the crura are never strictly parallel.

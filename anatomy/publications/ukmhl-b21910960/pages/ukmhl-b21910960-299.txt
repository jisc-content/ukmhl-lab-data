283 DISSECTION' OF THE BACK OE THE EOREAIiM. the thumb and forefinger, and the radial side of the middle finger.* The radial nerve commonly gives off a branch which joins that division of the ulnar nerve which supplies the radial border of the ring and contiguous side of the middle finger. The fascia on the bach of the forearm is composed of fibres interlacing and stronger than that upon the front of the forearm. It is attached to the condyles of the humerus and to the olecranon, and is strengthened by an expansion from the tendon of the triceps. Along the forearm it is attached to the ridge on the posterior part of the ulna. Its upper third gives origin to the fibres of the muscles beneath it, and separates them by septa, to which their fibres are also attached. Posterior should be considered as a part of the fascia of annular the forearm, strengthened by oblique aponeurotic igament. qu the back of the wrist to confine the extensor tendons. These fibres are attached to the styloid process of the radius, and thence pass obliquely inwards to the inner side of the wrist, where they are connected with the pisiform and cuneiform bones. Observe that they pass below the styloid process of the ulna, to which they are in no way attached, otherwise the rotation of the radius would be impeded. From the deep surface of this 'so-called' ligament, processes are attached to the ridges on the back of the radius, so as to form six distinct sheaths for the passage of the extensor tendons. Counting from the radius, the first sheath contains the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi and the extensor primi internodii pollicis; the second, the tendons of the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevier; the third, the tendon of the extensor secundi * The relative share which the radial and ulnar nerves take in supplying the fingers varies. Under any arrangement the thumb and each finger has two dorsal nerves, one on either side, of which the terminal branches reach the root of the nail. They supply filaments to the skin on the back of the finger, and have frequent communica- tions with the palmar digital nerves. In some instances one or more of the dorsal nerves do not extend beyond the first phalanx; their place is then supplied by a branch from the palmar nerve.

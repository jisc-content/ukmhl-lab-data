STRUCTURE OF THE LUNGS. 148 tissue, called * interlobular,' which is everywhere soft and elastic to allow the free expansion of the organ. The cells of this tissue have no communication with the air-vesicles unless the latter he ruptured by excessive straining, and then this intermediate tissue becomes inflated with air, and gives rise to ' interlobular emphy- sema.' When infiltrated with serum it constitutes 'oedema' of the lungs. Each lobule receives a small bronchial tube, which subdivides into smaller branches. Thus reduced in size, the walls of the tubes Fig. 30. Pig. 31. tJLTIMATE AlH-CELLS OF THE LUNG (FROM KOLLIKEE). MAGNIFIED TWENTY-FIVE TIMES no longer present traces of cartilaginous tissue, but are composed of a delicate elastic membrane upon which the capillaries ramify in a very minute network.* Each tube finally leads into an irregular passage (intercellular passage), from which proceed on all sides numerous dilatations : these are the air-cells, which vary from the ^^th. to the J-oth of an inch in diameter (fig. 31). The air-cells themselves present a number of shallow depressions, separated by somewhat prominent partitions, so that their interior has a * In phthisis the expectoration contains some of the debris of this elastic frame- work of the air-vesicles ; they can be seen under the mici-oscope. This is not a bad test of the character of the sputa.

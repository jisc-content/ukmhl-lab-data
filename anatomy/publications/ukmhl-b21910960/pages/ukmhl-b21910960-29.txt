13 THE DISSECTION OF THE NECK. artery. While in the cavernous sinus, small branches (arterise xeceptaculi) arise from the carotid and supply the pituitary body, and the walls of the cavernous sinus. Cavernous The superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic plexus. sends up with the carotid artery filaments, which form a plexus round it in its tortuous course through the carotid canal, and by the side of the sphenoid. After a careful dissection you may discover with the naked eye in this plexus, very small ganglia called carotid or cavernous; but they vary in number, size, and situation. Through these nerves a comnaunication is established between the sympathetic and the nerves which enter the orbit. THE DISSECTION OF THE NECK. Make an incision through the skin, down the middle of the neck from the jaw to the sternum; a second along the clavicle to the acromion ; a third along the base of the jaw as far as the mastoid process. Reflect the skin, and expose the cutaneous muscle called the 'platysma myoides.' Between the platysma and the skin is a layer of adipose tissue, called the ' superficial fascia.' It varies in thickness in different subjects, but is generally more abundant at the upper part of the neck, especially in corpulent individuals, in whom it occasions a double chin. The platysma myoides is the cutaneous muscle of myofd^.^ neck. It arises from the subcutaneous tissue over the pectoralis major and deltoid muscles ; thence pro- ceeding over the clavicle and the side of the neck, its fibres become more closely aggregated, and terminate thus:â€”The anterior cross those of the opposite platysma, immediately below the symphysis of the jaw, and are lost in the skin of the chin ; the middle are attached along the base of the jaw ; the posterior cross the masseter muscle, and terminate partly in the subcutaneous tissue of the cheek, partly in the muscles at the corner of the mouth.

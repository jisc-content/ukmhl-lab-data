The basilic vein ascends along the inner side of the arm with the internal cutaneous nerve. Near the upper third of the arm, it perforates the fascia, and empties itself either into the internal vena comes of the brachial artery, or into the axillary vein. The principal branches of the nerves pass beneath the veins; but many small filaments cross in front which are exposed to injury in venesection. Since the median basilic vein is larger than the median cephalic, and, on account of the strong fascia beneath, more easily compressible, it is usually chosen for venesection; its position therefore, in reference to the brachial artery, becomes very important. The vein is only separated from the artery by the fascia, derived from Relation of nerves and reins at elbow. Relation of median basilic vein to bracliial artery.

MUSCLES OF THE FACE. 64 It only remains to be observed that the upper cord of the brachial plexus receives a branch from the lower cord of the cer- vical, and that each of its component nerves communicate by slender filaments with the sympathetic system. Below the clavicle the plexus divides into branches for the supply of the arm; namely, the anterior thoracic nerves (two in number, to the pectoralis major and minor), the subscapular (three in number, to the subscapularis, the latissimus dorsi, and teres major), the circumflex (to the deltoid and teres minor), the median, the musculo-spiral, the ulnar, the external cutaneous, the internal cutaneous, and the lesser internal cutaneous (nerve of Wrisberg). DISSECTION OF THE EACE. Much practice is required to make a good dissection of the face. The muscles of expression are numerous and complicated; they are interwoven with the subcutaneous tissue and closely united to the skin : their fibres are often pale and indistinct. The face is amply supplied with motor and sensitive nerves, of which the ramifications extend far and wide. Therefore you must not be discouraged, if in a first attempt you fail to make a satisfactory display of the parts. The cheeks and nostrils should be distended with horsehair, and the lips sewn together. Make an incision down the mesial line of the face; another from the chin along the base of the lower jaw to the angle, then prolong it in front of the ear to the zygoma. Eeflect the skin from below upwards. Each muscle as it is cleaned must be put on the stretch by hooks. The nerve which supplies all the muscles of the face is the ' portio dura,' or facial division of the seventh cerebral nerve. It emerges from the stylo-mastoid foramen, and divides into branches, which pass through the parotid gland, forming a plexus termed the ' pes anserinus.' The sensitive nerves of the face are supplied by the three

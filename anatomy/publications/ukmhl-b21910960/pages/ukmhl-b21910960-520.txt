LIGAMENTS OF THE KNEE, 504 Capsular ligament. First examine the tendons concerned in the con- struction of the capsular ligament. In front is the ligamentum patelloe; on either side are the tendons of the vasti; at the back of the joint four tendons contribute to form the capsule—namely, the tendons of the gastrocnemius, the tendon of the semimembranosus, and of the popliteus. It deserves to be noticed that the weakest part of the capsule is near the tendon of the popliteus : here, therefore, matter formed in the popliteal space may make its way into the joint, or vice versa. Exclusive of the capsule, the proper ligaments of the joint are — I, the lateral; 2, the crucial in the interior. This is a broad flat band, which extends from the ral ligament." condyle of the femur to the inner side of the tibia, a little below its head. A few of the deeper fibres are attached to the inner semi-lunar cartilage, and serve to keep it in place. The inferior internal articular artery, and part of the tendon of the semimembranosus, pass underneath this ligament. In the several motions of the joint, there is a certain amount of friction between the liga- ment and the head of the tibia, and con- sequently a small bursa is interposed. This is a strong round STgte^r band, which extends from the outer condyle of the femur to the head of the fibula. This ligament separates the two divisions of the tendinous insertion of the biceps. Posterior to, and running parallel with, the external lateral ligament is a smaller band of fibres, called the short external lateral ligament. This, which is generally called ' ligamentum posti- cum Winslowii,' consists of expansions derived from the tendons at the back of the joint, chiefly, however. Fig. 112. Posterior ligament. 1.

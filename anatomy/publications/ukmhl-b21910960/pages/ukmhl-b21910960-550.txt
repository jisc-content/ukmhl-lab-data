DISSECTION OF THE BltAIN. 534 and disappears where the corpus callosum and the fornix become continuous. The septum consists of two layers, which inclose a space called the 'fifth ventricle' ( fig. 128). Each layer is made up of white substance inside, and of grey outside; the ventricle be- tween them is closed in the adult, and lined by a delicate serous membrane, which secretes in it a minute quantity of fltud; but in foetal life it communicates with the third ventricle between the pillars of the fornix.* Cut transversely through the corpus callosum and the septum lucidum, and turn forwards tbe anterior half.

This proceeding requires care, or the fornix will be reflected also, since these two arches of nervous matter are here so closely connected. . c This is a layer of white matter extending m the torm Tornix. ^^^^ fj-Q^i before backwards, beneath the corpus callosum.

345 DIAPHRAGM. In front of the right kidney is the liver, the ascending colon, and the vertical portion of the duodenuni; in front of the left, the descending colon, part of the spleen, and pancreas. This ex- plains how it is that a renal abscess or calculus is sometimes evacuated by the rectum. The kidneys and supra-renal capsules must be removed and reserved for further examination. Two large ganglia, the semilunar, are now to be searched for in the solar plexus. They are situated on each side of the cÂ£eliac axis, in the neighbourhood of the supra-renal bodies; that on the Fig. 70. 1. Aorta passing be- tween the crura. 2. Opening for oeso- ptagua. 3.

They are more or less oval, and filaments are distributed to the supra- renal and renal plexuses, and to the plexuses which surround the branches of the abdominal aorta. Above it is connected with the great splanchnic nerve (p. 126). This is a partly muscular and partly tendinous arch, Diaphragm, so constructed as to form a complete movable partition between the chest and the abdomen; a floor for the one, and a roof for the other. Its upper or thoracic surface is convex; its lower or abdominal, concave. To see the structure of the arch, its peritoneal lining must be removed. We then

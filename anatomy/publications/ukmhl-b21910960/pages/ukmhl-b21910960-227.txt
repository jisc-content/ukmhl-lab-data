LIGAMENTS Or THE SPINE. 211 This is a strong band of longitudinal fibres which common extends along the front of the bodies of the vertebrae ligament. ^^.^j^ ^xis to the sacrum. The fibres are not all of equal length. The more superficial extend from one vertebra to the fourth or fifth below it; those a little deeper pass from one vertebra to the second or third below it; while the deepest of all proceed from vertebra to vertebra. The ligament becomes broader and stronger in proportion to the size of the vertebrae. By making transverse incisions through it in different situations, we observe that its fibres are more firmly adherent to the intervertebral cartilages, and to the borders of the vertebrae, than to the middle of the bones. ^^^^ These bands of ligamentous fibres fill up the intervals spinous between the spines of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae, ligaments. They are the most marked in the lumbar region. Those fibres which connect the apices of the spines, being stronger than the rest, are described as separate ligaments rmder the name of supraspinous. Their use is to limit the flexion of the spine. These are called, on account of their colour, ligamenta hltwem^^ sub/lava.—To obtain a good view of them, the arches the arches of the vertebrae should be removed with a saw. They tebra P^^^ between the arches of the contiguous vertebras, from the axis to the sacrum; none existing between the occiput and the atlas, or between the atlas and axis. They are composed of yellow elastic tissue, and their strength increases with the size of the vertebrae. This elasticity answers a double pur- pose : it not only permits the spine to bend forwards, but materi- ally assists in restoring it to its curve of rest. They economise muscular force, like the ligamentum nuchas in animals.

422 .ANATOMY OF THE L,1VKU. the under surface of the right lobe are two shallow depressions; the anterior is for the colon, the posterior for the kidney. The remaining lobes may be considered as forming parts of the right lobe, and are, the lobulus Spigelii, the lohulua caudatus, and the lobulus quadratus. The lobulus Spigelii is placed between the fissures of the ductus venosus and vena cava; and behind the transverse fissure it is connected to the right lobe by a ridgeâ€”the lobulus caudatus. The lobulus quadratus is situated between the ^all-bladder and the longitudinal fissure. This lobe is occa^sionally connected with the left lobe by a bridge of hepatic substance (pons hepatis) which arches over the longitudinal fissure. The liver has a thin areolar coat or capsule, best seen on those parts of it not covered by peritoneum. This coat is connected to the fine areolar tissue which surrounds the lobules, but does not send down partitions to form a framework for the xn erior of the aland It is continuous, at the transverse fissure, with the sheath of loose areolar tissue called ' Glisson^s capside; which surrounds the vessels as they enter that fissure, and incloses them m a common sheath in their ramifications through the liver. The interlobular areolar tissue is exceedingly delicate: hence.

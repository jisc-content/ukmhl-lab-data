The third and last stratum is the fascia, which lies behind the transversalis muscle. It is attached, below, to the crural arch, thence ascends, and gradually diminishing in thickness, is lost on the under surface of the transversalis muscle. Its inner border is connected to the margm of the rectus, to the lower margin of the conjoined tendon, and Fascial etratum. Fig. 63. 1. Internal abdominal ring. 2.

This fascia is strongest just behind the external ring, and but for it and the conjoined tendon, there would be a direct opening into the cavity of the abdomen through the external ring. The outer half of the fascia is very firmly connected to the crural arch, and also to the fascia iliaca; but the inner half is loosely connected with the crural arch, and passes down under it, over the femoral vessels into the thigh, and forms what is called * the sheath of the femoral vessels.'

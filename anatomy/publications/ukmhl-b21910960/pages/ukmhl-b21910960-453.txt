437 STKUCTUKE OF THE LARGE INTESTINES. that of the stomach. That the mucous membrane of the large intestine may be temporarily used as a substitute for the stomach, is proved by the fact of persons having been nourished for many weeks, solely by injections. The mucous membrane is lined throughout with columnar epithelium. At the junction of the small with the large intestine vah-e*'^'^^ the mucous membrane is folded so as to form a valve : but it is not a perfect one, as is proved by pouring water into the large intestine, or by the occasional vomiting of injections.

The arrangement of the valve is best examined in a dried prepara- tion. The opening is a transverse fissure like a button-hole; and the two flaps are arranged like an upper and a lower eyelid. The flaps of the valve consist of mucous membrane apd the circular fibres of the ileum. The longitudinal fibres of the ileum are con- tmued directly on to the c^cum: if these be divided, the ileum can be drawn out, and the valve disappears.

SIDE VIEW OF THE PELVIC VISCEUA. 387 The function of the levatores ani is to retract the anus and the rectum after it has been protruded in defsecation by the combined action of the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm. This muscle should be regarded as a continuation of the levator ani. It arises from the spine of the ischium, gradually spreads out, and is inserted into the side of the coccyx, which it serves to support. At this stage of the dissection, the bladder should be drawn downwards, and the branches of the internal iliac artery and the sacral plexus clearly displayed. Fig. 84. PLAN OF THE BRANCHES OF THE INTEENAX ILIAC. Internal , ^^0°^ division of the common iHac artery, the iliac artery internal iliac descends into the pelvis, and, after a and branches. , • ■, , , course of about an inch and a half, divides, opposite the great sacro-ischiatic notch, into two large branches, an ante- rior and a posterior (fig. 84). The artery lies upon the lumbo- sacral cord and the pyriformis muscle; the ureter, inclosed in the posterior false ligament of the bladder, passing in front. The posterior division gives off the ilio-lumbar, lateral sacral, and glutseal arteries; the anterior gives off the superior vesical, obturator, inferior vesical, naiddle haemorrhoidal, ischiatic and c c 2

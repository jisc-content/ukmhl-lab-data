12G SYMPATHKTIC IN THE CHK8T. course of the left subclavian, covered externally by pleura. The pncumogastric nerve must be traced behind the root of the left lung to the oesophagus, and the oesophageal plexus of this side dissected. Lastly, notice the lesser vena azygos which crosses under the aorta about the sixth or seventh dorsal vertebra to join the vena azygos major. This portion of the sympathetic system is generally tion oftlw composed oi twelve gangua covered by the pleura; one Fj'mpathetic. ganglion being found over the head of each rib. Often there are only ten ganglia, in consequence of one or two of them 25. fusing together. The first thoracic ganglion is the largest. Each ganglion is connected by two branches with the corresponding spinal nerve. The nerves proceeding from the ganglia pass inwards to supply the thoracic and part of the abdominal viscera. The branches which proceed from the upper six ganglia are small and are distributed as follow (see the diagram):— a. Minute nerves from the first and second ganglia to the deep cardiac plexus. b. Minute nerves from the third and fourth ganglia to the posterior pulmonary plexus. The branches arising from the six lower ganglia uniteto formthreenerve^ —the great splanchnic, the lesser, and the smallest splanchnic nei^es. a. The great splanchnic nerve is generally formed by branches from the sixth to the tenth ganglia. They descend obliquely along the sides of DiAGUAM OF THE THORACIC ToiiTio:.- j bodics of thc dorsal vertebrae, and OF THE SYMPATHKriC.

ELBOW-JOINT. 299 of the radius admits not only of flexion and extension, but of rota- tion upon the rounded articular eminence (capitellum) of the hu- merus. The joint is secured by two strong lateral ligaments. No ligament is attached to the head of the radius, otherwise its rotatory movement would be impeded. It is simply surrounded by a liga- mentous collar, called the annular ligament, within which it freely rolls. Internal lateral ligament.—This is triangular. Its apex is attached to the internal condyle of the humerus: from this point the fibres radiate, and are inserted into the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna. A transverse band of ligamentous fibres extends from the ole- cranon to the coronoid process across a notch observable on the inner side of the sigmoid cavity: through this notch vessels pass into the joint. External lateral ligament—This is attached to the external Kg. 56. a. External lateral ligament. b. Orbicular ligament. ring.

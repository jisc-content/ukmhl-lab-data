LIGAMENTS OP THE HIT 502 and to the middle of the neck behind. The capsule is made exceedingly thick and strong in front, by a broad ligament, ilio- femoral, which extends from the anterior inferior iliac spine to the anterior inter-trochanteric line. This ligament is very strong, and serves as a strap to prevent the femur being extended beyond a certain limit; and to prevent the body from rolling backwards at the hip. llio-lumbar ligament Interosseous ligament Open the capsule to as- certain the enormous thick- ness of it in front, and the strong hold it has upon the bones. This exposes the coty- loid ligament, and the liga- mentum teres. Theligamentum Ligamen- ^ -g exposed by turn tei-es. ^ â– ' drawing the head of the femur out of the socket. This ligament is somewhat flat and triangular. Its base is attached, below, to the borders of the notch in the acetabulum; its apex to the fossa in the head of the femur. To prevent pressure on it, and to allow free room for its play, there is a gap at the bottom of the acetabulum. This gap is not crusted with cartilage like the rest of the socket, but is occupied by soft fat. The liga- mentum teres is surrounded by the synovial membrane. A little artery runs up with it to the head of the femur. It is a branch of the obturator, and enters the acetabulum through the notch at the lower part. . The chief use of the ligamentum teres is to assist m steadying the pelvis on the thigh in the erect position. In this position, the ligament is vertical, and quite tight (fig. HI) : it therefore prevents VEHTICAI, SECTION THHOTTGH THE HIP.

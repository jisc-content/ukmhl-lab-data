245 DISSECTION OF THE FUOiNT OF THE FOUEARM. DISSECTION OF THE FRONT OF THE FOREARM. Prolono- the incision down to the wrist, and at its termination make another transversely. Reflect the skin, and carefully dissect the subcutaneous veins and nerves. On the inner side is found the anterior ulnar vein. Cutaneous ^y^jicJi commences on the front of the little linger and veins. . ° wrist, and is then continued upwards on the inner side of the forearm as far as the elbow, where it is joined by the posterior ulnar vein to form the basilic (p. 234). The veins on the back of the hand commence at the extremities of the fingers, run up between the knuckles, and unite on the back of the hand in the shape of an arch, with its concavity up^ wards. The 'posterior ulnar vein arises from this arch by a branch (vena salvatella) situated over the fourth interosseous space, and runs up on the back of the forearm towards the inner condyle, to join the anterior ulnar vein. The radial vein, situated on the outer side of the forearm, commences on the back of the hand from the venous arch, runs up the outer side of the front of the forearm to the elbow, where it becomes the cephalic. Eunning up in front of the middle of the forearm is the median vein: near the bend of the elbow it is joined by a deep branch— mediana 'profunda—after which it divides into two branches, an outer or median cephalic, which joins the cephalic, and an inner or median basilic, which joins the basilic. On the radial side of the forearm, as low down as MiTes^""^ the wrist, are found. the terminal branches of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. At the lower part of the forearm, these filaments are situated over the radial artery. On the ulnar side is the anterior division of the internal cutaneous nerve, while its posterior branch passes to the back of the forearm, supplying it as far as the middle. On the outer and back part of the forearm near the elbow, the external cutaneous branch of the. musculo-spiral is seen running down as far as the wrist. At the lower third of the radial side of the forearm, the radial nerve:

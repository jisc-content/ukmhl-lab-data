BRANCIIKS OF THE SUBCLAVIA^^. 60 Deep cervical. This artery is given off by the siibclaviaa behind the fntercostal. scalenus anticus, so that you must divide the muscle to see it. It descends into the chest behind the pleura, passing over the necks of the first and second ribs, and furnishes the arteries of the two iipper intercostal spaces. It usually inoscu- lates with the first inter- costal branch of the aorta. The corresponding vein terminates on the right side in the vena azygos; on the left in the brachio- cephalic. This artery arises from the superior inter- costal, seldom dii'ect from the subclavian. It goes to the back of the neck between the first rib and the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra, and ascends between the complexus and the semi- spinalis colli, both of which it supplies. It sometimes inosculates with the ' prin- ceps cervicis,' a branch of the occipital a. To test your knowledge of the branches of the sub- clavian artery, reflect upon the answer to the follow- ing question :—If the ar- tery were tied in the first part of its course before it gives off any branches, how would the arm be supplied with blood? The answer is, by five collateral channels, as follow:—1. By the com- DIAGRAM TO SHOW THE INOSCUXATIOXS OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTEUY.

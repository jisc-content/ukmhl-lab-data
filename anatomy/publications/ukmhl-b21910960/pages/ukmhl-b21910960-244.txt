228 DISSECTION OF THE AXILLA. the anterior edge of the subscapularis towards the lower angle of the scapula. Its numerous branches supply the subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, and serratus magnus, and anastomose with the intercostal and thoracic arteries, as well as the posterior scapular (a branch of the subclavian). 6. The posterior branch (dorsalis scapulae) runs to the back of the scapula, through a triangular space, bounded in front by the Fig. 46. PLAN OF THE BEANCHES OF THE AXIXLAEY AETEKY. 1.

Long thoracic. long head of the triceps; below, by the teres major; and above, by the subscapular and teres minor (diagram, p. 229). On the back of the scapula, it divides into branches, which ramify close to the bone, supplying the infra-spinatus and teres minor, and anastomose with the supra-scapular and posterior scapular arteries (diagram, p. 60). The subscapular vein empties itself into the axillary vein. There are two circumflex arteriesâ€”an anterior and posterior ^""^ a posterior, so called from the manner in which they circumflex encircle the neck of the humerus. The posterior dr- artenes. c^^^jiex artery is as large as the subscapular, close to which it is given off; or both may arise from a common trunk from the axillary. It passes backwards through a quadrilateral

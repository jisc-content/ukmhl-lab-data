Their convex borders are attached to the fibrous ring at the root of the artery; their free edges, which look upwards, present a festooned border, m the centre of which is a small cartilaginous body called the 'nocmus'ox ^corpus ArantU: The use of these bodies is obvious. Smce the valves are semilunar, when they fall together they would not exactly close the artery ; there would be a space of a triangular form left between them in the centre, just as there is when we put the thumb, fore, and middle fingers together. This space is filled up by these nodules, so that the closure becomes complete The valves are composed of a fold of the ' endocardvam; or hmng membrane of the heart, and contained between the folds ig a thm layer of fibrous tissue, which is prolonged from the ten- dinous nng at the orifice of the artery. This layer of fibrous tissue, however, reaches the free edge of the valve at three points only; namely, at the centre, or corpus Arantii, and at each extremity Between these points it stops short, and leaves a crescent-shaped portion of the valve thinner than the rest and consisting simply of endocardium. This crescent-shaped portion (called the ' lunula ') is not wholly without fibrous tissue, for a hin tendinous cord runs along its free edge, to give it additional strength to resist the impulse of the blood. Behind each of the valves the artery bulges and forms three slight dilatations called * The best mode of showing the action of the valve is to introduce a gla^s tube into h epuhnona^ artery, and then to pour water through it into the venSS unt 1 th would 0 her,^l beto mu. .^^^^^/^f of the cords at a time whe^ they erwise be too much slackc-ned by the contraction of the ventricle.

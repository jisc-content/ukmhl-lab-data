SOFT PALATE. with the back of the pharynx, and thus prevents the food from returning thi'ough the nose. On making a perpendicular section through the soft palate, you see that the great bulk of it is made up of mucous glands, which lie thick on its under surface to lubricate the passage of the food. Above these glands we come upon the aponeurosis°of the palate, still higher, upon the two portions of the palato-pharyncreus,' separated by the fibres of the levator palati, and, lastly, upon the azygos uvuliB covered by the nasal mucous membrane. The soft palate is supplied with bloodbythe descendingpalatine branch of the mternal maxillary, and the ascending palatine branch of the ex- ternal maxillary. Its nerves are derived from the palatine branches of the second division of the fifth and from the glosso-pharyngeal. Uv^la.

Its length varies in different individuals, and m the same person at different times, according to the state of its muscle. It occasionally becomes permanently elongated and causes considerable irritation, a tickle in the throat, and harassing cough When you have to remove a portion of it, cut off only the redundant mucous membrane.

These are the anterior and posterior half arches or pillars of the palate. The anterior arch describes a curve from the base of the uvula to the side of the tongue. It IS well seen when the tongue is put out. The poster nor arch, commencing at the side of the uvula, curves along the free margin of the palate, and terminates on the side of the pharynx.

DISSECTION OF THE UPPER ARM. 233 olecranon; on the inner side of the arm, one joins a branch from the nerve of Wrisberg. The branches of the internal cutaneous nerve perforate the fascia about the middle of the inner side of the arm, and subdivide into filaments which supply the anterior and posterior surface of the forearm, as low as the wi'ist. The lesser internal cutaneous (nerve of Wrisherg) perforates the fascia about the lower third of the arm, and supplies the skin over the internal condyle and olecranon. The internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nei^e, sometimes wanting, and always small, comes through the fascia near the middle of the inner side of the arm. The nerves which perforate the fascia near the middle of the outer part of the arm, are the external cutaneous branches of the musculo-spiral. They are accompanied by a small branch from the superior profunda artery. They divide into filaments, one of which is to be traced down the outer and back part of the forearm, nearly as low as the wrist. On the outer side of the tendon of the biceps the external cu- taneous nerve perforates the fascia, and divides into many branches, which supply the skin of the outer part of the forearm. Disposition "^^^ ^^^^ object of attention should be the disposition ofTeinsin of the veins in front of the elbow. In cleaning these elbowÂ°^ '^^^^ divide the branches of the in- ternal and external cutaneous nerves which pass both above and below them. The following is the ordinary arrangement of the superficial veins at the bend of the elbow: On the outer side is the radial; on the inner side is the ulnar vein; in the centre is the median, which divides into two branches; the external of which, uniting with the radial to form the cephalic vein, is called the median cephalic; the internal, uniting with the ulnar to form the basilic, is named the median basilic. Near its bifurcation, the median vein communicates by a branch (mediana profunda) with the deep veins which accompany the arteries of the forearm. Trace the cephalic vein up the arm. It runs along the outer

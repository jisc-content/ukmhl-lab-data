It is accompanied by a branch of the ischiatic artery, called the ' comes nervi ischiaticV * This comes from the lower part of the sacral plexus. It leaves the pelvis with the greater ischiatic nerve, but on the inner side of it, and in company with the Lesser ischiatic nerve. * The arteria comes nervi ischiatici runs generally by the side of the nerve, but sometimes in the centre of it. This artery becomes one of the chief channels by which the blood reaches the lower limb after ligature of the femoral. See a preparation in the Museum of St. Bai-tholomew's Hospital, where the femoral was tied by John Hunter fifty years before the man's death.

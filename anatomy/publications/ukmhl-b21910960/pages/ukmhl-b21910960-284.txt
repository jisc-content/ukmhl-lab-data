268 MUSCLES OF THE BACK CONNECTED WITH THE AllM. ai-ch towards the radial side of the palm, and terminates in the adductor pollicis, and inner head of the flexor brevis polliciB. Between the pisiform and unciform bones, the nerve gives a branch to each of the muscles of the little finger. Subsequently it sends branches to each interosseous muscle and to the two inner lumbricales. The tendon of the flexor carpi radialis in the palm must now be followed to its insertion into the bases of the second and third metacarpal bones. The dissection of the remaining muscles of the palm, called, from their position, ' interossei,' must be for the present post- poned. MUSCLES OF THE BACK CONNECTED WITH THE ARM. Make an incision down the spine from the occiput to the sacrum; another from the last dorsal vertebra upwards and out- ward to the acromion; and a third from the sacrum along the crest of the ilium; then reflect the skin outwards from the dense subcutaneous tissue, in which will be found the following cuta- neous nerves. These are derived from the posterior branches of the S^rTT spinal nerves, and correspond generally to the number the back. ^Â£ ^j^g vertebrae. The posterior primary branches, much smaller than the anterior, divide between the transverse processes into external and internal branches. From the internal, which become superficial near the spines of the vertebra?, are derived those branches which supply the skin in the cervical and upper dorsal regions ; from the external, which appear near the angles of the ribs, those which supply the skin of the lower dorsal and lumbar regions. In the cervical and upper dorsal region, the cutaneous nerves perforate the complexus, splenius, and trapezius; in the lower dorsal and lumbar region they perforate the serratus posticus inferior and latissimus dorsi. As might be expected, the external branches are the larger, especially in the loins, where some of them

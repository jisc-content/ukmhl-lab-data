PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION, Without departing from the original object of the Manual, new matter has been added here and there to this edition, more es- pecially concerning the Anatomy of the Brain, the Organs of the Senses, and the Abdominal Viscera. A few additional woodcuts have been introduced ; and the order of dissection altered where it was considered advisable. The author takes this opportunity of acknowledging that the real work of preparing this edition has been done by his colleague Mr. LANaTON, one of the Demonstrators of Anatomy at Saint Bartholomew's Hospital. 65 GownR Strekt : Ociober 1868,

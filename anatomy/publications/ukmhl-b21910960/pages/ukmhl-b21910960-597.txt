The testicle is a gland of an oval shape, with flattened Testis. ^ides, suspended obliquely, so that the upper end points forwards and outwards, the lower end in the reverse direction. The left is generally a little the lower of the two. The ordinary weight of each gland is about six drachms; but few organs present greater variations in size and weight, even in men of the same Fig. 137. "1.

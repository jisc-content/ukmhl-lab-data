Its posterior surface is received into the fossa between the hemispheres of the cerebellum. In front and behind, the medulla is marked by a median fissure—the anterim' and ■posterior median fissures, which are the continuations upwards of the median fissures of the spinal cord. The anterior terminates below the pons Varolii in a cul-de- Fig. 120. DIAGEAlt OF THE FEONT ST7EFACE OF THE MEDUIXA OBLONGATA. sac, named 'foramen ccecum;^ it is occupied by a fold of pia mater. On each half of the medulla, there stand out, in relief, four longitudinal columns. Those nearest to the anterior fissure are called the ' anterior pyramids.^ External to these are the * olivary bodies.' Still more external, and towards the posterior part of the medulla, are the ' restiform bodies;' lastly, on each side of the posterior median fissure, are the 'posterior pyramids.' The anterior pyramids are narrow below, but gradually increase in breadth as they ascend towards the pons, from which they are separated by a transverse groove. Their component fibres are

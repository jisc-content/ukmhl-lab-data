DISSECTION or THE AXILLA. 229 epace, bounded above by the subscapularis and teres minor, below by the teres major, externally by the neck of the humerus, and internally by the long head of the triceps (fig. 47). It then winds round the back of the neck of the humerus, and is distributed to the under surface of the deltoid. Fig. 47. DIAGRAM OF THE ORIGINS OP THE TRICEPS. 1. Snbscapularis. 2. Teres major. 3. Long head of triceps. 4. Square space for circumflex a. and n. 5. Triangular space for dorsalis scapula; a. e. Space for musoulo-spiral n., and superior profunda a. Besides the deltoid, the posterior circumflex artery supplies the long head of the triceps, the head of the humerus, and the shoulder- joint. It inosculates above with the acromio-thoracic and supra- scapular arteries, below with the ascending branch of the superior profunda (a branch of the brachial), and in front with the anterior circumflex artery. If you cannot find the posterior circumflex artery in its normal position, look for it (as a branch of the brachial) below the tendon of the teres major. The anterior circumflex artery, much smaller than the pos- terior, runs in front of the neck of the humerus, above the tendon- of the latissimus dorsi. It passes directly outwards beneath the coraco-brachialis and short head of the biceps, close to the bone.

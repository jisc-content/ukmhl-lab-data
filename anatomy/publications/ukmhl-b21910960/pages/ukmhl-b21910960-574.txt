5o8 DISSECTION OF THE EYE; with scissors about a quarter of an inch from the margin of the cornea. With a little care, it is easy to remove the outer coat of the eye without injuring the dark choroid coat, the ciliary liga- ment, or the iris. In the loose dark-brown cellular tissue between the sclerotic and the choroid are seen the ciliary nerves passing forwards towards the iris; their white colour makes them very conspicuous on the dark ground. The cornea is the brilliant and transparent coat Cornea. ^j^ich occupies about the anterior fifth of the globe. Although apparently delicate, yet it is quite as tough and thick as any part of the sclerotica. It is nearly circular in diameter and is about the ^^^th of an inch in thickness. It is firmly connected at its margin to the sclerotic, with the fibres of which it is con- tinuous. The margin of the sclerotic is beveled on the inside; that of the cornea on the outside; so that the former overlaps the latter (fig. 134).

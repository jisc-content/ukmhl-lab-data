THE DISSECTION OF THE ARM. 217 The inter-articular fibro-cartilage is of an oval form, and thicker at the margin than at the centre. It is connected on the outer side to the external lateral ligament, and on the inner side some of the fibres of the external pterygoid are inserted into it. There are tivo synovial membranes for the joint. The larger and looser of the two is situated between the glenoid cavity and the fibro-cartilage. The other is interposed between the fibro- cartilage and the condyle of the jaw. They sometimes communi- cate through a small aperture in the centre of the fibro-cartilage. The form of the articulation of the lower jaw admits of motion â€”upwards and downwards, forwards and backwards, and from side to side. A combination of these motions takes place in mastication: during this act the condyles of the jaw describe an oblique rotatory movement upon the glenoid cavity. The purposes served by this fibro-cartilage in this joint are, that it follows the condyle, and adapts a convenient socket for all its movements; and that, being elastic, it breaks shocks; for shocks here would be almost fatal, considering what a thin plate the glenoid cavity is, and that just above it is the brain. THE DISSECTION OF THE AEM. The arm being placed at right angles with the body, make three incisions through the skin: the first, along the middle of the sternum; the second, along the clavicle and down the front of the arm for about four inches; the third, from the ensiform cartilage vertically downwards, to the posterior border of the axilla. The skin should be carefully separated from the subjacent layer of adipose tissue (called the superficial fascia). In doing so, unless the subject be very muscular, you will scarcely notice the thin pale fibres of the broad cutaneous muscle of the neck ('pla- tysma myoides,' p. 13), which arises in this tissue. Cutaneous The numerous nerves which run through the sub- serves, cutaneous tissue to the skin and mammary gland must

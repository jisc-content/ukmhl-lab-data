The longitudinal portion of the muscle arises from the bodies of the t wo or three upper dorsal and the two lower cervical vertebrae and is inserted into the bodies of the second, third, and fourth cervical vertebrae. The superior oblique portion, arising from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebra, ascends inwards, and is inserted into the front pai t or body of the first cervical vertebra. The inferior oblique portion proceeds from the bodies of the three upper dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the transverse processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae. The action of this muscle, taken as a whole, must be to bend the cervical region of the spine. Its nerves come from the deep cervical and brachial plexuses. This muscle arises from the anterior tubercles of fn\?cusmajS. transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone, in front of the foramen magnum. This muscle arises from the root of the transverse Rectus capitis rxui^j. -i ii ^ ■ • anticus minor. Process 01 the farst cervical vertebra, and is inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone, nearer to the foramen magnum than the preceding muscle. The action of the recti muscles is to bend the head forwards. They are supplied with nerves from the deep cervical plexus. LIGAMENTS OF THE SPINE. The vertebrae are connected by their intervertebral fibro-carti- lages, by ligaments in front of and behind their bodies, and by ligaments which extend between their arches and their spines. Their articular processes have capsular ligaments, and synovial membranes.

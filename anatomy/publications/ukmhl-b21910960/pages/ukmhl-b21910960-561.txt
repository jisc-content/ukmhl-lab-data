MEMBRANES OF THE SPINAL CORD. 545 Peculiar!- membranes of the spinal cord, though continuous ties of the with those of the brain, differ from them in certain ofThe and. I'^spects, and require separate notice. The 'dura mater' of the cord is a tough fibrous ura mater. j^gj^Q^jpane like that of the brain, but does not adhere to the bones, because such adhesion would impede the free move- ment of the vertebrae upon each other. It is attached above to the margin of the foramen magnum, and may be traced down- wards as a canal as far as the first bone of the sacrum, from which it is prolonged as a cord to the coccyx, where it becomes continuous with the periosteum. It forms a complete canal, which loosely surrounds the spinal cord, and sends off prolongations over each of the spinal nerves. These prolongations accompany the nerves only as far as the intervertebral foramina, and are then blended with the periosteum. Cut through the nerves which proceed from the spinal cord on each side, and remove the cord with the dura mater entire. Then slit up the dura mater along the middle line, to examine the arachnoid membrane. Arachnoid ^^^^ ' arachnoid membrane ' of the cord is a continu- membrTne. ^^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ tl>e brain, and, like it, consists of a vis- ceral layer which surrounds the cord, and of a parietal, which lines the inner surface of the dura mater. The Adsceral layer is not in immediate contact with the pia mater underneath, but is separated from it by a transparent watery fluid contained in the meshes of the subarachnoid tissue (p. 548). This cerebro- Cerebro s ' ^^^^^^ ^"^^ cannot be demonstrated unless the cord be naTfluid.'^" examined very soon after death, and before the removal of the brain.* The nerves proceeding from the cord tt'I7^'J^''^*°'"'°'^ situation of the cerebro-spinal fluid were fii-st discovered hy Haller (Element Phys. vol. iy. p. 87), and subsequently more minutely investigated by Magend,e (Recherches Phys. et Cliniques sur le Liquide Cephalo-rachidien, in 4to avec atlas: Pans, 1842). This physiologist has shown that if, during life, th; arches of the vertebra are removed in a horse, dog, or other animal, and the dura mater of Uae cord punctured, there issue jets of a fluid which had previously made the sheath tense. The fluid communicates, through the fourth ventricle, with that in the general ventricular cavity. The collective amount of the fluid varies from 1 to 2 oz. or more.

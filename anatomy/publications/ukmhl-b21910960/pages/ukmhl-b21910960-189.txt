DISSECTION OIT THE TONGUE. I73 symphysis of the jaw, to the os-hyoides, and to the styloid process of the temporal bone. To the soft palate it is connected by the anterior palatine arch (p. 157); and to the epiglottis by three folds of mucous membrane: in the middle fold is enclosed a layer of elastic tissue, called the ' glosso-epiglottidean' ligament. This pulls up the epiglottis when the tongue is put out of the mouth : hence the rule of never attempting to pass a tube into the oesopha- gus without pushing back the tongue; otherwise the tube would pass into the larynx. The posterior part or root of the tongue is connected to the hyoid bone by the hyo-glossi and the genio-hyo-glossi muscles; its anterior part or tip is free, and lies behind the lower incisor teeth. Its upper surface or dorsum is convex with a median groove which terminates posteriorly in a mucous follicle, the ' foramen ccBcum: On its under surface is a fold of mucous membrane called the 'frmnum linguce; which connects the tongue to the floor of the mouth. The surface of the tongue is covered with mucous membrane which consists of structures similar to those of the skin generally • that IS to say, it consists of a 'cutis,' or true skin with numerous projections, called ^papillce^ and of a thick layer of squamous epithelium. The cutis is much thinner than that of the skin • it affords insertion to some of the superficial muscular fibres of the tongue, and the blood-vessels form a close network in it before they pass into the papillse.

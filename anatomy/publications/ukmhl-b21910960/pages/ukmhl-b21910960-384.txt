MALE PERINEUM. 368 makes its exit through the muscular fascia of the thigh, a little above the tuber ischii. It ascends nearly parallel to the ramus of the ischium and pubes, and dividing into filaments, supplies the skin of the perineum and scrotum. This muscle embraces the bulb of the urethra. It Accelerator arises from a fibrous median raphe beneath the bulb, and from the tendinous centre of the perineum. Start- ing from this origin, the fibres diverge and are inserted as follows: —The upper ones proceed on either side round the corpus caver- Fig. 76.

Thus the entire muscle acts as a powerful compressor of the bulb and expels the last drops of urine from this part of the urethra. By dividing the muscle along the middle Une and turn- ing back each half, its insertion, as above described, can be clearly made out.

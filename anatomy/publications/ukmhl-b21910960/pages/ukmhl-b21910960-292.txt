MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER. 276 Fig. 52. the humerus, a little above the middle of the Rhaft. The insertion of the tendon extends one incli and a half along the Immerus, and terminates in a smaller V-shaped form, the origin of the brachialis anticus being on either side. The muscular bundles composing the deltoid have a peculiar arrangement: a peculiarity arising from its broad origin and its narrow insertion. It consists in the interposition of tendons between the bundles for the attachment of the muscular fibres. The annexed woodcut shows this beautiful arrangement better than any description. The action of the muscle is not only con- centrated upon one point, but its power is also greatly increased, by this arrangement. It raises the arm; but it cannot do so beyond an the deltoid, ^ngle of sixty degrees. The elevation of the arm beyond this angle is effected through the elevation of the shoulder by the trapezius and serratus magnus. Its anterior fibres draw the arm forwards; its posterior, backwards. This powerful muscle is well sup- plied with blood, by the anterior and posterior circumflex, the tho- racica humeraria, the thoracica acromiaUs, all from the axillary artery; also by the deltoid branch of the brachial. Its nerve is the circumflex. The deltoid gives the rotundity to the shoulder. When the head of the humerus is dislocated into the axilla, the fibres of the muscle run vertically to their insertion; hence the flattening of the deltoid, and the greater prominence of the acromion. Below the deltoid we generally meet with ununited fracture of the humerus; owing to the muscle raising the upper fragment. ANALYSIS OF THE DELTOID.

TEMPORAL REGION. 82 which supply the skin of the forehead and scalp. The supra- orbital artery is a branch of the ophthalmic. The infra-orbital nei-ve is the terminal branch of the superior maxillary or second division of the fifth nerve. It emerges with its artery from the infra-orbital foramen, covered by the levator labii superioris. The nerve immediately divides into several branches, palpebral, nasal, and labial; the palpebral, ascending beneath the orbicularis, supply the lower eyelid, and communicate with the facial: the nasal pass inwards to supply the nose and join the nasal branch of the first division of the fifth ; the labial, by far the most numerous, descend into the upper lip, and eventu- ally terminate in lashes of filaments, which endow the papillae of the lip with exquisite sensibility. The infra-orbital artery is the terminal branch of the internal maxillary; it supplies the muscles and skin, and inosculates with branches of the facial. The mental nerve is a branch of the inferior maxillary or third division of the fifth. It emerges from the mental foramen in the lower jaw, in a direction upwards and backwards, beneath the depressor labii inferioris. It soon divides into a number of branches, some of which supply the skin of the chin, but the greater number terminate in the papillse of the lower lip. The mental artery is a branch of the inferior dental. It sup- plies the gums and the chin, and inosculates with the sub-mental and inferior coronary arteries.

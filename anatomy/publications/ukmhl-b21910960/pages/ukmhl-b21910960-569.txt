SPINAL CORD. 553 divide into two bundles : one of these, called the fillet of Keil (12), mounts over the superior crus of the cerebellum to the corpora quadrigemina, beneath which it meets with the corresponding fillet of the opposite side ; the other proceeds with the crus cerebri to the cerebrum. lateral "^^^ lateral columns (9), on reaching the medulla ob-^ columns of lougata, are disposed of in three ways, as follows —Some the cord. q£ ^j.g g^^gg come forward between the diverging anterior columns, decussate in the middle line, and contribute to form the pyramid of the opposite side; others ascend with the restiforni tract into the cerebellum; a third set ascend along the floor of the fourth ventricle * (concealed by its superficial grey matter), and then along the upper part of the crus cerebri into the cerebrum. ■ The posterior columns (10) ascend under the name JrostBrior columns of of the restiform tracts at the back of the medulla oblon- cor/^'°^^ gata, diverge from each other, and are, for the most part, continued into the cerebellum, forming its inferior crura; but some of their fibres run on along the floor of the fourth ven- tricle (external to the fibres from the lateral columns), then along the upper part of the crura cerebri into the cerebrum.

Some of these transverse fibres appear on the surface over the pyramid and the olive; these have received the name of'a^-ci/oj-m/&res'(p. 517). It is difficult to deter- mine the object of this system of transverse fibres, or what parts * These fibres constitute what are sometimes called the 'round cords' of the fourth ventricle. t Ueber die Medulla Oblongata.

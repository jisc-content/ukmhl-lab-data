292 INTEROSSEOUS MUSCLES. carpal ligament. A bursa is frequently developed between their digital extremities. These muscles, so named from their position, extend ?usdeTÂ°''' from the sides of the metacarpal bones to the bases of the first phalanges and the extensor tendons of the fingers. In each interosseous space (except the first, in which there is only an abductor) there are two, one of which is an ab- ductor, the other an adductor of a finger. According to this arrangement there are seven in all; fovu- of which, situated on the back of the hand, are called dorsal; the remainder, seen only in the palm, are called palmar.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. XII is presupposed ; and directions are laid down for the best method of dissecting it. The several regions of the body are treated of in the order considered most suitable for their examination; and the muscles, vessels, nerves, &c. are described, as they are successively exposed to view in the process of dissection. The author has written the work entirely from actual observa- tion : at the same time no available sources of information have been neglected, the highest authorities both English and Foreign having been carefuUy consulted. His acknowledgments are especially due to F. C. Skbt, Esq. F.R.S., Lecturer on Anatomy at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, for many valuable suggestions. He is also much indebted to his young friend, Mr. W. Clubbe, for able assistance in dissections. September 1851.

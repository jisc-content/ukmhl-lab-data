SOLE OF THE EOOT. 497 it appears to be, a part of its curve near the fifth metatarsal bone lies immediately beneath the fascia. Here ifc might be more easily tied than in any other part of its course. Its chief branches are the four digital ar- teries, which arise in the arched part of its course. They supply both sides of the fifth, fourth, third, and the outer side of the second toe; the great toe, and the inside of the se- cond, being supplied by the dorsalis hallucis. Concerning the distribution of the digital ar- teries, refer to the account given of these arteries in the hand ; they are in all respects similar (p. 259). Besides the digital arteries, the arch gives off" three small branches—the per/oraiwi^ — which ascend between the three outer meta- tarsal spaces, and inosculate with the dorsal interosseous arteries. The posterior tibial nerve di- vides, like the artery, into an ex Fig. 109. Plantar nerves. ternal and internal plantar. The 2^'e"™^ do.''""- hiternal plantar is generally the larger, and supplies nerves to three toes and a half, like the median in the palm. It also sup- plies the muscles on the inner side of the sole, the abductor polhcis, the flexor brevis pollicis, the flexor brevis digitorum the two inner lumbricales; also articular branches to the tarsus and metatarsus. The external plantar nerve sends branches to the flexor accessorius and the abductor minimi digiti, and then divides into a superficial and deep branch. The suveriicial Wh supplies the fifth toe and the outer side of ZtZl toe (like the ulnar nerve in the palm), and the flexor brevis mmimi digiti. The deep branch furnishes nerves to the wo outer lumbricales, the adductor pollicis, the transversalis pedis, and all the interossei. f K K

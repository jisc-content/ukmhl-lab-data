KIDNEY. 428 Fig. 94. reddish-brown. Each weighs about five ounces in the male, rather less in the female. The left is usually longer and somewhat heavier than the right. The anterior surface of each is smooth and convex; the posterior rather flattened. The outer border is rounded; the inner presents a deep notch—the hilua—for the entrance and exit of the renal vessels and duct. These have the following relations to one another: in front lies the renal vein; behind is the ureter; between them the renal artery. The kidney is surrounded by a thin fibroiis capsule, to which it is loosely connected by areolar tissue and minute vessels. The capsule does not penetrate into the interior of the kidney, and can, for this reason, when healthy, be readily stripped off, leaving the surface perfectly smooth. A loncritudinal section should be made through the kidney to ex- amine its interior. This section displays two distinct substances, an outer or cortical, and an inner or medullary. The medullmy structure is col- lected into from ten to sixteen pyramidal bundles (pyramids of Malpighi,* fig. 94); the apices of these, termed 'jpajpillcB,' pro- ject into one of the terminal di- visions of the excretory tube. These pyramids are composed of minute straight tubes, which proceed from the cortical portion to end on the papillse. f * So named after Malpighi, a celebrated Italian anatomist who lived during the middle and latter part of the seventeenth century. t Each pyramid represents what was, in the early stage of the kidney's growth, a distinct and independent lobe. In the human subject the lobes gradually coalesce, SECTIOK OF THE KJDNEY. 1. Ureter. 2. Pelvis of tbe kidney. 3. 3, 3. PapillEe.

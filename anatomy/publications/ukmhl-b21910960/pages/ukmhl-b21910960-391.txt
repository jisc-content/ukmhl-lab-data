MALE PERINEUM. 375 It ascends for a short distance under cover of the arch, but soon enters the crus. To see the dorsal artery of the penis, the penis naust be dis- sected from its attachment to the symphysis pubis. The artery should be traced running upon the dorsum of the penis down to the glans. It forms a complete arterial circle round the corona glandis, and gives numerous ramifications to the papillae on the surface. The pudic nerve comes from the sacral plexus, and xuciic n6rv6 corresponds both in its course and branches with the artery. It gives off its external or inferior haemorrhoidal, and its superficial perineal branchesâ€”a small one to the bulb, and another to the crus penis; but the main trunk of the nerve runs with the artery along the dorsum of the penis to the glans (p. 373). In its passage it supplies the integuments of the penis, and sends one or two branches into the corpus cavernosum. This part of the penis also receives nerves from the sympathetic system. This is the deep hollow on each side between the Iscmo-EECTAi^j^^g and the tuber ischii. When all the fat is removed from it, observe that it is lined on all sides by fascia. Introduce the finger into it to form a correct idea of its extent and boundaries. Externally, it is bounded by the tuber ischii and the fascia covering the obturator internus muscle; internally, by the rectum, levator ani and coccygeus; posteriorly, by the gluteus maximus; anteriorly, by the transversus perinei. The fossa is crossed by the external haemorrhoidal vessels and nerves. ^ These deep recesses on each side of the rectum explain the great size which abscesses in this situation may attain. The matter can. be felt only through the rectum. Nothing can be seen outside. Perhaps nothing more than a little hardness can be felt by the side of the anus. These abscesses should be opened early; else they form a large cavity, and may burst into the rectum.

It is triangular, and placed transversely at the lower end of the ulna, filling up the interval caused by the greater length of the radius. Its base is attached to the lower end of the radius, and its apex to the root of the styloid process of the ulna. It is thin at the base and the centre, thicker at the apex and the sides. Its upper surface is in contact with the ulna, and covered by the synovial membrane of the radio-ulnar joint; its lower surface,

LIGAMENTS OF THE ANKLE. fact, that in dislocations of the ankle inwards, the summit of the malleolus is more likely to be broken off than the ligament to be torn. It extends from a deep excavation at the apex of the malleolus, radiates from this point, and is attached to the side of the astragalus, also to the os calcis, and the scaphoid bone. Besides this, some of its fibres are inserted into, and become Fig. 115, 1. Plantar fascia. 2. Calcaneo-scaplioid or elastic ligament wWcli supports the head of the astragalus. 3.

This ligament consists of three distinct parts—an Serar^ anterior, a posterior, and a middle (fig. 116). All three arise from an excavation near the summit of the external malleolus; the first two are inserted into the front and the back of the astragalus respectively ; the middle into the outer sur- face of the OS calcis.

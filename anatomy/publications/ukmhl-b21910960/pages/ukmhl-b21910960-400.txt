381 SIDE VlliW OF THE PELVIC VISCERA. This tube, about eighteen inches long, conveys the Ureter. ^^..^^ ^^.^^^ ^^^^ kidney to tlie bladder. In the dissection of the abdomen we saw it behind the peritoneum, descending along the psoas muscle, and crossing the division of the common iliac arteries. Tracing it downwards, in the posterior false ligament of the bladder, we find that it runs along the bladder, external to the vas deferens, and enters it about an inch and a half behind the prostate, and about two inches from its fellow of the opposite side (fig. 82). It perforates the bladder very obliquely, so that the aperture, being valvular, allows the urine to flow into, but not out of the organ. The narrowest part of the ureter is at the vesical orifice; here, therefore, a calculus is more likely to be detained than at any other part of the canal. This tube conveys the seminal fluid from the testicle Vas deferens. .^^^ prostatic part of the urethra. It ascends at the back part of the spermatic cord through the inguinal canal into the abdomen; then leaving the cord at the inner ring, it curves downwards over the side of the bladder, gradually approach- ing nearer the middle line. Before it reaches the prostate it passes between the bladder and the ureter; then, becoming very tortuous, it runs internal to the vesicula seminalis, and is jomed by the duct of this vesicle. The common duct thus formed (ductus communis ejaculatorius) terminates in the lower part ot the prostatic portion of the urethra (fig. 73, p. 361). In point of size and hardness, the vas deferens has very much the feel of whipcord. These are situated, one on either side, between the Vesicute ^i^(ider and the rectum (fig. 82). Each is a tube, semmales. convoluted that, it looks like a little sacculated bladder. When rolled up, the tube is about two and a half mches long; when unravelled, it is more than twice t^^f l^^f^' abou the size of a small writing quill. Several blind tubes, or c^cal prolongations, proceed from the main one, after the manner

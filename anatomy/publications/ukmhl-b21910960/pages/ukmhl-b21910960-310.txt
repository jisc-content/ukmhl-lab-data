The palmar and dorsal interossei are supplied by offsets from the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. DISSECTION OF THE LIGAMENTS. The inner end of the clavicle articulates with a shallow excavation on the upper and outer part of the sternum. The security of the joint depends upon the strength of its ligaments. There are two synovial membranes, and an intervening fibro-cartilage. The anterior sterno-clavicular ligament (fig. 55), consists of a Joint be- tween THE CLAVICLE AND THE STEKNUM. Fig. 55.

Interartioular fibro-cartilage. broad band of ligamentous fibres, which pass obliquely downwards and inwards over the front of the joint, from the end of the clavicle to the anterior surface of the sternum. A similar band, the posterior sterno-clavicular ligament, ex- tends over the back of the joint, from the back of the clavicle to the back of the sternum. The clavicles are connected by the inter-clavicular ligament. It extends transversely above the notch of the sternum, and has a

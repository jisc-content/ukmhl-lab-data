15 ANTEKIOR JUGULAR YEIX. Before its termination the external jugular vein generally re- ceives the supra-scapular, posterior scapular, and other unnamed veins: a disposition very unfavourable for the surgeon, because there is a confluence of veins immediately over the subclavian artery in the place where it is usually tied.

The anterior jugular vein is situated more in the middle of the neck, and is much smaller than the exter- nal jugular. It commences by small branches below the chin, and runs down the front of the neck, nearly to the sternum : it then curves outwards, beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle, and opens either into the external jugular or the subclavian vein. We commonly meet with two anterior jugular veins, one on either side; immediately above the sternum they communicate by a transverse branch. The size of the anterior jugular vein is inversely proportionate to that of the external jugular. When the external jugular is small, or terminates in the internal jugular, then the anterior

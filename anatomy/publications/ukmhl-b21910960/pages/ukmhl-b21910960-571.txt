555 DISSECTION OF THE EYE. ganglia, the crus receives a very large addition to its fibres: these then branch out widely towards all parts of the hemisphere, in order to reach the cortical substance on the surface. From what has been said, it appears that the crura or roots of the cerebellum and the cerebrum contain part of the motor and part of the sensitive tracts of the spinal cord. DISSECTION OF THE EYE. Since the human eye cannot be obtained sufficiently fresh for anatomical purposes, the student should examine the eyes of animals, of the sheep or pig. The first thing to be done is to remove the conjunctival coat, and the loose connective tissue which unites it to the sclerotica. The conjunctiva is the mucous membrane which lines Membrana the ocular surface of the eyelids and the front part of conjunctiva. eyeball. It is attached by loose folds to the sclerotic coat, so as not to impede the motions of the globe. The palpebral portion of it is very vascular, and provided with fine papillas which are abundantly supplied with nerves.* It is continued into the Meibomian glands, the puncta lachrymalia, and the ducts of the lachrymal gland. The ocular portion is thinner and has no papillae. It is nearly colourless, except when inflamed; it then becomes in- tensely vascular and of a bright scarlet colour. An abundant supply of nerves has been bestowed upon the membrane for the purpose of giving it that degree of sensibility necessary to guard the eye. The corneal portion is composed chiefly of epithelial cells, ar- ranged in layers. This portion of the conjunctiva cannot be sepa- rated by dissection in recent eyes, but it possesses the same acute sensibility as the rest of the conjunctiva. Changes produced by inflammation of the conjunctiva are often continued over the cornea, * These papillae were first pointed out by Eble, TJeber denBau und dieKrankheiten des Bindehaut des Auges.

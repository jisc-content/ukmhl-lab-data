386 SIDE VIEW OF THE PELVIC VISCERA. in its passage It is divided into three portions—the prostatic, the Sic 2ch membranous, and the spongy. At present we can only examine the relations of the membranous part, which comprises that part of the canal intermediate between the pros- tate and the bulb. The urethra in this part is about one inch in leno-th, but somewhat longer on its upper than its lower surface, in consequence of the encroachment of the bulb. In its passage tinder the arch of the pubes, it is surrounded by the muscular fibres of the compressor urethrse. It traverses the two layers of the triangular ligament, and is about an inch below the symphysis pubis, and nearly the same distance from the rectum; it is not, however, equidistant from this portion of the intestine at all points, because of the downward bend which the rectum makes towards the anus.* . . The membranous part of the urethra in children is very long, owing to the smallness of the prostate at that period of life; it is also composed of thin and delicate walls, and lies close to the rectum. In sounding a child, therefore, it is very necessary not to use violence, else the instrument is Ukely to pass through the coats of the urethra and make a false passage. This muscle supports the anus and lower part ot the Leyator ani. ^.^^^^^ a sling; and, with the coccygeus and com- pressor urethra, forms a muscular floor for the cavity of the pelvis. To see it, the pelvic fascia must be reflected from its inner sur- face. It arises from the ramus of the pubes near the symphysis, from the spine of the ischium, and from a tendinous hue extend- ng"n a gentle curve between these points of bone ; this hne being h! divisfon of the pelvic fascia (p. 378).

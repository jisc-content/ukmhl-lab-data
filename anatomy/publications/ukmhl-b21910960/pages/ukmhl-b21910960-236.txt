PECTORAL REGION. 220 thoracic branches of the brachial plexus; with blood, by the long and short thoracic branches of the axillary artery. Reflect from the clavicle, the clavicular portion of UiTi^fra-'^^ the pectoralis major, and in doing so, a small nerve, clavicular t^jg anterior thoracic, must be noticed entering the region. ^^^ider surface of the muscle. Beneath the portion so reflected, part of the pectoralis minor will be exposed. Between the upper border of this muscle and the clavicle, is an important space, in which you must dissect and examine the relative position of the following obj ectsâ€” ^ ^ a. A strong ligamentous expansion, called the costo- coracoid coracoid fascia, which extends from the cartilage of fascia. ^j^g gj.g|^ j.^^ i-\jq coracoid process. Between these points it is attached to the clavicle, and forms a complete invest- ment for the subclavius muscle. It presents a crescent-shaped edge, which arches over, and protects the axillary vessels and nerves: from this edge is prolonged a fascia, which passes in front of the axillary vessels forming the anterior portion of their sheath ; the posterior being formed by a prolongation of the deep cervical fascia. The front portion of this sheath is perforated by the cephalic vein, thoracica acromialis artery, and anterior thoracic nerve. This fascia must be removed. b. The subclavius muscle enclosed in its fibrous sheath. c. The axillary vein, artery, and brachial plexus of nerves. d. A short arterial trunk (the thoracic axis), which divides into several radiating branches. e. The termination of the cephalic vein in the axillary. /. Two nerves (the anterior thoracic), which descend from the brachial plexus below the clavicle, cross in front of the axillary vessels to supply the pectoral muscles. This muscle lies between the clavicle and the first Subclavius. ^^ .ggg fj,^^ ^i^g cartilage of the first rib by a round tendon, and is inserted into a groove on the under surface of the clavicle between its two tubercles. Its nerve comes from the brachial plexus. Its action is to depress the clavicle, and prevent its too great elevation.

From the insertion of the muscles it is reflected backwards over the globe of the eye, and the optic nerve, and separates the eye from the fat at the bottom of the orbit.

The remaining two are called from their direction, ' obliqui,'' one superior, the other inferior. There is also a muscle to raise the upper eyelid, termed ' levatwpalpebrce.' Fig. 39.

The nei^es are : the optic, which passes through the optic foramen ; the third, the fourth, the first division of the fifth, and the sixth, all of which pass through the sphenoidal fissiu-e. The third supplies all the muscles with motor power, except the superior oblique, which is supplied by the fourth, and the external rectus, which is supplied by the sixth. The ophthalmic division of the fifth divides into a frontal, lachrymal, and nasal branch. The orbit contains, also, a considerable quantity of soft fat, which forms a bed for the eye and prevents it from being pulled too far back by its muscles. Upon the quantity of this fat depends, in some measure, the difference in the prominence of the eyes. Its absurp-

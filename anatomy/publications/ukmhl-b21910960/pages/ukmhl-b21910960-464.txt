448 PAUTS CONCERNED IN FEMORAL HERNIA. Sh th of "^^^ femoral vessels do not descend uncovered beneath the femoral the crural arch, but come dowa inclosed in a mem- vessels, branous sheath. This sheath appears to be derived im- mediately from the arch itself, but it is really formed, in front, by a prolongation from the fascia transversalis of the abdomen. This prolongation, uniting with the continuation from the iliac fascia to join the fascia lata behind the femoral vessels, forms a funnel, â– with the wide part uppermost, into which the femoral vessels enter.

This is what is described as the funnel-shaped sheath of the femoral To examine this sheath satisfactorily, it is necessary to reflect, from its attachment to the crural arch, the upper horn of the saphenous opening, as shown in fig. 101. By this proceeding, you expose the fascia transversalis coming down over the femoral vessels, and forming the front part of their sheath. The hind part of the sheath is formed by the fascia iliaca, which runs down behind the vessels to ioin the pubic portion of the fascia lata. The sheath descends about as low as the lower horn of the saphenous opening.

444 DISSECTION OF THE GROIN. thin prolongation of the fascia lata itself across the opening. Its chief surgical importance is derived from the fact that it forms one of the coverings of a femoral hernia. The cribriform fascia must now be removed so aa to display the saphenous opening, which will appear as represented in fig. 99. Reverting to the saphenous opening, we observe that it is situ- ated just below the crural arch, not far from the pubes; that it is oval with the long axis vertical, and about one and a half or two inches long. Its border on the inner or pubic side is not defined; for here the fascia lata ascends under the femoral vessels, and is continuous with the iliac fascia of the pelvis.* But the out^r or iliac border is defined clearly enough. This lies in front of the femoral vessels, is crescent-shaped, with the concavity towards the pubes, and called the falciform process of ' Burns.' The lower horn of the crescent curves under the saphena vein, and is lost in the fascia on the inner side of the opening. The upper horn * On the inner side of the femoral vessels the pubic portion of the fascia is to the linea ilio-pectinea.

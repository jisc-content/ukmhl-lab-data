CORPUS CALLOSUM. 329 brum.* It k about four inches long, and rather nearer to the front than to the back part of the brain. Its surface is slightly arched from before backwards. A shallow groove, called the * raphe,'' runs along the middle of its upper sui-face (fig. 124); in a fresh brain, two white streaks, named the nerves of Lancisi, run UPPEE SURFACE OF COE- Ptrs CAixosuir. 1,1.

The surface of the. corpus callosum is marked by transverse lines which indicate the course of its fibres: these are the hnece transversce of the old anatomists. The anterior cerebral arteries proceed along the surface of the corpus callosum to the back of the brain.

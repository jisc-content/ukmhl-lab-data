Examine carefully the openings of the two venae cavae: they are not directly opposite to each other ; the superior is situated on a plane rather in front of the inferior, that the streams of blood may not meet- Fig. 28. Aurioulo-ventricular orifice , Fossa ovalis d^ening of the coronary vein Line of Eustachian valve DIAGEAM OF THE INTEKIOE OF THE EIGHT AXIEICLE. The inferior cava, after passing through the tendinous centre of the diaphragm, makes a slight curve to the left before it opens into the auricle, that the stream of its blood may be directed towards the auriculo-ventricular opening. The orifice of each vena cava is nearly circular, and surrounded by muscular fibres continuous with those of the auricle. The internal wall of the auricle is formed by the 'septum auricularum: Upon this septum, above the orifice of the vena cava inferior, is an oval depression {fossa ovalis), bounded by a prominent border {cmnulus ovalis). This depression indicates the remains of the opening {foramen ovale) through which the auricles communicated in festal life. After birth this opening closes ; but if the closure is imperfect, the stream of dark blood in the right auricle mixes with the florid blood in the left, and occasions what is called 'morhus cceruleus: A valvular communication, however, not unfrequently exists between the auricles in this situation which is not attended with indications of this disease.

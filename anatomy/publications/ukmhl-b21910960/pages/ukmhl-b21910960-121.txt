105 DISSECTION OF THE CHEST. technically, the sacs are reflected over the heart and the lungs, on each side respectively. But the anterior and posterior mediastina remain unaltered. Looking at the chest in front, the anterior mediastinum appears as shown in the cut (p. 117). It is not precisely longitudinal in its direction, but inclines slightly towards the left, owing to the position of the heart. Its area varies : thus it is extremely narrow in the middle where the edges of the lungs nearly meet; but it is wider above and below, where the lungs diverge. What parts are contained in the anterior mediastinum ?â€”The remains of the thymus gland, the origins of the sterno-hyoid, sterno- thyroid, and triangularis sterni muscles, the left brachio-cephalic vein (which crosses behind the first bone of the sternum), and a few absorbent glands.

DIAGBAM OF THE BEFXECTIONS OF THE PLEtTKAl SACS IN DOTTED LINES. The posterior mediastinum (fig. 19) contains the oesophagus, the two pneumogastric nerves, the aorta, the thoracic duct, and the vena azygos. A middle mediastinum is described by some anatomists. It is the largest of the mediastina, and contains the heart with its

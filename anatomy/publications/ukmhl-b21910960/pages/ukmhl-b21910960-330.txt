It is inserted into the fifth, sixth, and seventh costal cartilages. Notice the tendinous intersections aci'oss the muscle called linece transverscB,' which are only incomplete repetitions of the ribs in the wall of the abdomen.'* Their number varies from three to five, but there are always more above than below the umbilicus. These tendinous intersections adhere closely to the sheath in front, but not behind ; consequently, matter formed between the front of the rectus and its sheath would be confined by two intersections; not so on the back of the muscle, for matter might travel down the entire length of it. The sheath of the rectus is composed in front by the aponeurosis Fig. 60. of the external oblique, and half the thick- ness of that of the in- ternal oblique ; f while the back of the sheath comprises the aponeu- rosis of the transversa- lis, and the other half of the internal oblique (fig. 60). This, however, applies only to the up- per three fourths of the muscle; the lower fourth DIAGBAM OF A THANSVERSE SECTION THBOUGH THE Jj^g jjg sheatfa behind.

It arises from the upper part of the pubes in front of the rectus, and terminates in the linea alba about midway between the * Some animals—e.g. tlie crocodile—have bony abdominal ribs, t The line where the internal oblique splits—namely, along the outer border of the rectus—is called the linea semilunaris.

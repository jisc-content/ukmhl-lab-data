MUSCLES OF THE FACE. 66 move the lips. Upon a nice balance of their opposite actions depends the play of the mouth.* This miiscle aWses from the oblique line of the lower Depressor • ^^j^^^ ^j^^ foramen mentale, and is inserted into angiili oris. J . . i- -ii the angle of the mouth, mterminglmg with the zygo- matic muscles. It is an important muscle in the expression of sorrowful emotions. We see its action when children cry. This muscle arises from the oblique line of the Depressor labii , iaw, and is inserted into the lower lip. It mferions, or iu<vcj. j .1 v quadratus covers the vessels and nerves which come through the foramen mentale. It must therefore be divided in cutting through the nerve in cases of neuralgia. This muscle arises from the lower jaw below the mentf"" incisor teeth, and is inserted into the skin of the chin. ™^ To see it properly, evert the lower lip and remove the mucous membrane on either side of the frsenum. There are two of them, one for each side. Their action is well shown when we shave.

The Z. minor arises from the outer surface of the malar bone, in front of the preceding, and is inserted into the angle of the mouth, joining the levator labii superioris. The action of the zygomatici is seen in laughing. Before examining the orbicularis palpebrarum, notice the tendo oculi. To make the tendon more apparent the tarsal cartilages should be drawn outwards. _ This tendon is about two linesf in length, and is Tendo ocnli. ^.g^dily felt at the inner angle of the eye by drawing * In strong muscular lips tlie upper part of the orbicularis sends a small sub- cutaneous slip of muscle from eacb side along the septum nasi nearly to the apex. The interval between the two slips corresponds to the furrow which leads from the nose to the lip. This is the ' naso-labialis' or'depressor septi narium ot HaUer and Albinus. t A line is the twelfth part of an inch.

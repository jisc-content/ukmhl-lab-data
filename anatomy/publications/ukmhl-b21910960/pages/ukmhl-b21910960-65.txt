49 CERVICAL PLEXUS. for the present postponed. Meantime, let us make out the deep cervical plexus and its branches. Cervical "^^^^ plexus is formed by the anterior branches of plexus of the four upper cervical nerves. It consists of a series nerves. loop-like communications, which take place between these nerves, close to the transverse processes of the four upper cervical vertebrse. The plexus is situated behind the sterno- mastoid and internal jugular vein, and lies in front of the scalenus medius and the levator anguli scapulae. The plexus gives off swperficial and deey branches. The super- ficial branches have been already described (p. 16). The deep branches may be divided into an internal and an external series. Internal Series.—1. The pJirenic arises from the third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerves, and passes through the thorax to be distributed to the diaphragm. 2. The communicantes noni come from the second and third cervical nerves, wind round the internal jugular vein, and join the descendens noni in front of the carotid sheath, supplying the de- pressor muscles of the os-hyoides and larynx. 3. Muscular branches to the recti antici and lateralis and longus colli muscles. 4. Branches which communicate with the pneumogastric, hypo- glossal, and sympathetic nerves, and one to join the fifth cervical. External Series.—1. One or more branches to the nervus accessorius. 2. Muscular branches to supply the trapezius, levator anguli scapulae, scalenus medius, and sterno-mastoid. The clavicle should now be sawn through the middle, and the sterna] half raised with the sterno-mastoid attached, so that the bone can be replaced, to study its relation to the subjacent parts. The scalene muscles and the subclavian artery throughout its whole course must next be carefully dissected. The scalene muscles, so called from their resemblance to a scalene triangle, extend from the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae to the first and second ribs. They may be con- ic

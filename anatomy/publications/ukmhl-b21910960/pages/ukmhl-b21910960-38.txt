It leaves the skull through the foramen lacerum posterius, runs behind the internal jugular vein, then passes obliquely through the upper third of the sterno-mastoid, and crosses the posterior triangle of Fig. 6.

The nervus accessorius supplies also the sterno-mastoid, and, after leaving the muscle, is joined by branches from the second and third cervical nerves. The upper mastoid artery, a branch of the occipital, runs into the sterno-mastoid with the nerve. The supra-clavicular triangle is bounded below by the clSilar clavicle, in front by the outer border of the sterno-mas- triangle. ^^-^^ above by the posterior portion of the omo- hyoid muscle. The area of the triangle thus formed will vary in proportion to the obliquity of the omo-hyoid muscle, and the extent to which the sterno-mastoid is attached to the clavicle; the trape- zius must also be taken into the account, for in some instances it

PARTS CONCERNKD IN INGUINAL HKRN'IA. 324 variety occurs when a protrusion of intestine takes place through the narrow canal, whicli in some cases persists between the general cavity of the peritoneum and the tunica vaginalis testis, in conse- quence of the non-obliteration of the original communication between them. In this variety, the intestine surrounds the tes- ticle, and the hernial sac is formed by the tunica vaginalis testis (fig. 64). The infantile variety is rare, and occurs when the original peritoneal canal alluded to, is only partially obliterated. The result of which is, that the tunica vaginalis testis may reach as high as the external or even the internal abdominal ring. Now in this variety of hernia, the intestine protrudes a sac behind the abnormal extension of the tunica Fig. 64. * vaginalis; so that, in front of the hernia there are three layers of peritoneum; namely, two formed by the tunica vaginalis testis, and one by the hernial sac (fig. 64).

The stricture, however, may be caused by the mouth of the sac itself, independently of the parts outside it; for the peritoneum may become thickened and indurated, and sufficiently unyielding to strangulate the protruded parts. . . We cannot do better than adhere to the golden rule wbTcfthe" laid down by Sir A. Cooper; namely, to divide; the T'l u stricture, in all cases, directly upwards. In this direc- divTded.

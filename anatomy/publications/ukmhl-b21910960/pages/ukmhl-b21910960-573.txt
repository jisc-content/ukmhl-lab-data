The thickest part of the sclerotic coat is at the back of the globe (fig. 134), and thinnest a short distance behind the cornea. The back of the sclerotic is perfor- ated by the optic nerve, which en- ters it a little on the nasal side of the axis of vision. The optic nerve at its entrance into the sclerotic is Very much constricted, and instead of passing through a single large aperture in this coat, enters it through a porous network of fibrous tissue called the lamina a^ibrosa.^ Around the optic nerve the sclerotic is perforated by the ciliary arteries, veins, and nerves, for the supply of the choroid coat and the iris. Towards the front, the sclerotic becomes much thinner, and about a quarter of an inch from the cornea it receives the insertion of the recti muscles ; here also it is perforated by the anterior ciliary arteries, which come for- ward along the tendons of these muscles, and form a vascular ring round the margin of the cornea. The sclerotic is composed of fibro-cellular tissue arranged in bundles which run, some longitudinally and some transversely. The longitudinal fibres are the most external and abundant. Under the microscope fusiform and stellate cells can be seen inter- spersed among the fibres, between which fine elastic fibres may also be demonstrated. The inner surface of the sclerotic is coated by a thin layer of areolar tissue impregnated with dark pigment cells. It is called ' lamina fusca: At present it is believed that no nerves exist in the sclerotic. To examine the cornea, it should be removed with the sclerotic coat. This should be done under water, by making a circular cut * In the centre of the lamina cribrosa is an opening larger tlian the rest, whieli serves for the transmission of the arteria centralis retinae. It is sometimes called the j)orm opticus.

222 DISSECTION OF THE AXILLA. Anterior Tliese nerves come from the brachial plexus, to supply thoracic the pectoral muscles. There are generally two—an external and an internal -one for each pectoral muscle (p. 62). The external arises from the outer cord of the brachial plexus, passes over the axillary artery, and supplies the pectoralis major; the internal comes from the internal cord, and emerges between the axillary artery and vein, to enter the under surface of the pectoralis minor. From this view of the relations of the axillary artery ^•i^g'the °^ in the first part of its course, some idea may be formed first part of of the difficulty of passing a ligature round it in this Ste^.'^^"'"'' situation. In addition to its great depth from the sur- face, varieties sometimes occur in the position of the nerves and veins, which would render the operation still more embarrassing. For instance, the anterior thoracic nerves may be more numerous than usual, and form by their mutual communi- cation a plexus around the artery. A large nerve is often seen crossing obliquely over the artery, immediately below the clavicle, to form one of the roots of the median nerve. The cephalic vein may ascend higher than usual, and open into the subclavian; and, as it receives large veins corresponding to the thoracic axis, a concourse of veins would be met with in front of the artery. Again, it is by no means uncommon to j&nd a deep-seated vein (e.g. the supra-scapular) crossing over the artery to join the axillary vein. DISSECTION OF THE AXILLA. The skin having already been reflected, it is necessary to notice the axillary sebaceous glands, and afterwards to make out the axillary fascia. Sebaceous close contact with the skin, near the roots of the glands. hairs in the axilla, are numerous sebaceous glands. They are of a reddish brown colour, and rather larger than a pin's head.

Below the clavicle, it gives off the following :â€” From the outer cord, an anterior thoracic branch, the external * This seems, from a number of dissections, to he the most frequent arrangement of the nerves forming the brachial plexus. This arrangement is, however, very variable, often differing on the two sides in the same subject,

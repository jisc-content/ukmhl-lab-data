In order to see the origin of the elevators of the upper lip and no§e, the lower circumference of the orbicularis oculi must be raised. , ,.. This arises from the superior maxillary bone near Levator labu ^ .. . , . superioris its Orbital margin, and passing downwards divides into alaeque nasi. ^^.^ portions, an inner inserted into tbe side of the nose, an outer into the upper lip. It acts chiefly in expressing the smile of derision, and the scornful affections of the mind. Its habitual use occasions corresponding permanent folds in the skin, which are, to a certain extent, indicative of the feelings and passions. This arises from the lower margin of the orbit above superioHs^ the infra-orbital foramen, and is inserted into the upper lip. It is nearly an inch in breadth at its origin, and it covers the infra-orbital vessels and nerves. This muscle, which is covered by the levator labii Levator sunerioris, arises from the canine fossa of the superior anguu oris. ^ i • • j j maxilla, below the infra-orbital foramen, and \?,%nsertea into the angle of the mouth, superficial to the buccinator, its fibres blending with those of the orbicularis oris, zygomatici, and de- pressor anguli oris. Two muscles belonging to the nose must now be examined— the triangularis or compressor nasi, and the depressor labii supe- rioris This muscle is triangular, and arises by its apex from Compressor superior maxillary bone, internal to the canine fossa, and is attached by a broad thin aponeurosis which spreads over the dorsum of the nose and joins its fellow.

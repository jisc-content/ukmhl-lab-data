482 BACK OF THE THIGH. Two or more absorbent glands are situated one on glandt""^ each side of the artery. They deserve attention, because, when enlarged, their close proximity to the ■artery may give them an apparent pulsation which might be mis- taken for au aneurism. DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE THIGH. The incision should be continued along the back of the thigh, and the skin reflected. The skin at the back of the thigh is supplied by the nerwl^'and lesser ischiatic nerve, which runs down beneath the veins. fascia, as low as the upper third of the calf, distributing branches on either side. There are no subcutaneous veins of any size at the back of the thigh : here they would be liable to pressure. But near the ham we find a vein, called the ' external saphena.' It comes up the back of the calf, and joins the popliteal vein. Eespecting this, remark that its fibres run chiefly in Muscular transverse direction, that it becomes stronger as it passes over the popliteal space, and that here it is con- nected with the tendons on either side. Kemove it, to examine the powerful muscles which bend the leg, caUed the ' hamstrings.' There are three of these, and all arise by strong Hamstring tendons from the tuber ischii. One, the biceps, is muscles. ^^^^^.^^^ j^to the head of the fibula; the other two— namely, the semitendinosus and semimembranosus—are inserted into the tibia. The divergence of these muscles towards their respective insertions occasions the space termed the ' ham,' which is occupied by soft fat, and the popliteal vessels and nerves. This muscle has two origins, a long and a short. Biceps. rj^j^g i^^g i-akes place, by a strong tendon, from the back part of the tuber ischii; the short one, by fleshy fibres, from the linea aspera of the femur. This origin begins at the linea aspera, just below the insertion of the glutseus maximus, and con-

DISSECTION OF THE HEART. 141 AiTangement ^.^^ "^uscular fibres of the heart are of the striped ofthemus- variety, but' differ from ordinary striped muscular Shett. ^^'""S somewhat smaller, destitute of sarco- lemma, and branched. Most of the fibres are attached by both extremities to the fibrous rings of the heart. The fibres of the auricles are distinct from those of the ventricles. They consist of a superjicial layer common to both cavities, and a deeper layer proper to each. The superjicial fibres run trans- versely across the auricles, and are most marked on the anterior surface; some pass into the septum. Of the deeper fibres, some run in circles chiefly round the auricular appendages and the entrance of the great veins, upon which a few may be traced for a short distance; others run over the auricles, and are attached in front and behind to the auriculo-ventricular rings. Of the ventricular fibres, some are common to both ventricles, others proper to each. The septum is formed principally by the fibres of the left. The superficial fibres take a more or less spiral course from the base towards the apex of the heart, where they coil round, pass into the interior of the ventricle, and form either the 'carnefe columns' or 'musculi papillares.' Most of these fibres are eventually inserted into the auriculo-ventricular rings. The circular fibres are chiefly found near the base of the ventricles, and passing round become attached to the rings at the base of the heart.* Eeduced to their simplest expression, the ventricles consist of two muscular sacs, enclosed in a third equally muscular. The same may be said of the auricles. Thickness of ''^^""^^^ thickness of the right auricle is about the cavities. ^^^^ > that of the left, one and a half. The measure must not be taken during the ' rigor mortis.' The average thickness of the right ventricle at its thickest part —I.e. the base—is about two lines : that of the left ventricle at Its thickest part-i.e. the middle-is about half an inch. In the lemale the average is less. fil^nelwh r ^'•^'=1'' ^» Todd's Cyclopedia.

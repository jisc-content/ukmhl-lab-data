A bursa intervenes between the oblique ligament and the insertion of the tendon of the biceps. The use of this ligament is to limit supination of the radius.

The joint is secured by an anterior, a posterior, and two lateral ligaments, forming, together, an uninterrupted capsule around it. The external lateral ligament extends from the styloid process of the radius, to the scaphoid bone and the anterior annular ligament (p. 302). The internal lateral ligament proceeds from the extremity of the styloid process of the ulna, to the cuneiform bone. Some of its fibres are attached to the pisiform bone, and the anterior annu- lar ligament. The anterior ligament consists of two or more broad bands of ligamentous fibres, which extend from the lower end of the radius, to the first row of carpal bones. The posterior ligament, weaker than the preceding, proceeds from the posterior surface of the lower end of the radius, and is attached to the posterior surfaces of the first row of carpal bones. The synovial membrane lines the under aspect of the triangu- lar fibro-cartilage at the end of the ulna, is reflected over the several ligaments of the joint, and thence upon the first row of the carpal bones.

This muscle arises from the angle of the thyroid frytS-' cartilage and the crico-thyroid membrane, runs hori- deus. zontally backwards, and is inserted into the base and anterior border of the arytenoid. Its fibres run parallel with the vocal cord, and some of them are directly inserted into it. Part of the muscle spreads out so as to form a floor for the ventricle ot the larynx, and is inserted into the outer border of the arytenoid cartilao-e. Nerve from the inferior laryngeal. This muscle relaxes the vocal cord. More than this, it puts the lip of the glottis in the ' vocalising' position; in this position, the lips of the glottis are parallel, and the chink is reduced to the breadth of a shilling.* * M anjteno-epigloitideus.-Tlus consists of a few pale muscular fibres "idosed in the aryteno-epiglottidean fold. Some of them run near the free margin of the fold,

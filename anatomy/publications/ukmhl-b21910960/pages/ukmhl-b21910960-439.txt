These lobules vary in shape according to the direction in which they are cut; in a transverse section, they have the appearance of mosaic pavement (fig. 92); but in a perpendicular section they somewhat resemble an oak leaf (fig. 93). Each lobule consists of a Kg. 92. a. Inter-lobular vein. b. Intra-lobular vein. TRANSVEESE SECTIONS OP THBEE L0BT71ES OF THE LIVES, MAGNIFIED TO SHOW THE POETAl TENOUS PIEXTJS.

It will facilitate the understanding of the branchings of the different hepatic vessels, if it be borne in mind, 1, that the portal vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic duct, ramify together from hrst to last—they are inclosed in a sheath of areolar tissue called Glissons capsule;' 2, that the hepatic veins run from first to last by themselves, and terminate in the inferior vena cava as it passes through the liver. The portal vein on entering the substance of the liver gives off numerous small branches which pass between the lobules and form

182 DISSECTION OF THE OlllilT. The rectus superior is supplied by the upper division of the third nerve; the rectus internus, the rectus inferior and obliquus inferior, by the lower division. The rectus externus is supplied by the sixth. Follow the recti to the eye, in order to see the tendons by which they are inserted. Notice also the ' anterior ciliary arteries,' which run to the eye along the tendons. The congestion of these little Fig. 41. vessels occasions the red zone round the cornea in iritis. It has been already mentioned that the tendons are invested by a fascia, which passes from one to the other, form- ino" a loose tunic over the back of the eye. It is this fascia which resists the passage of the hook in the operation for the cure of squinting. Even after the com- plete division of the tendon, the eye may still be held in its faulty iNSEBTioN OF THE RECTI MUSCLES WITH posltiou, if thls tlssue, iustead of ANTEBIOB CILIABY ARTEEIES. ... r, j u possessmg its proper softness and pliancy, happen to have become contracted and unyielding. Under such circumstances it is necessary to divide it freely with the scissors. By removing the conjunctival coat of the eye, the tendons of the recti are soon exposed. The breadth and the precise situation of their insertion deserve attention in reference to the operation for strabismus. The breadth of their insertion is about three eighths of an inch, but the line of this insertion is not at all points equidistant from the cornea. The centre of the insertion is nearer to the cornea by about one line than either end. Taking the internal rectus, which has most frequently to be divided in strabismus, we find that the centre of its tendon is, upon an average, three lines only from the cornea, the lower part nearly five lines, and the upper four. It is, therefore, very possible that the lower part may be left undivided in the operation, being more

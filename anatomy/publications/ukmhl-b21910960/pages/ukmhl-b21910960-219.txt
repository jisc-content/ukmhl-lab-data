203 MUSCLES OF THE BACK. This is the cervical continuation of the musculus ascendens. accessonus. It arises by tendinous slips from the four or five upper ribs, and is inserted into the transverse processes of the three or four cervical vertebrae. The longissimus dorsi (the inner portion of the erector muSrsi. spiiife) terminates in tendons which are inserted into the tubercles * at the root of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebra9, also into the transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebrae, and into the greater number of the ribs (varyiog from eight to eleven) close to their junction with the transverse processes. This is the cervical continuation of the longissimus Iransver- _i • tj. • i t ° ■j^-^'-u.lita salis coUi. arises by tendinous slips from the transverse processes of the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth dorsal vertebras, and is inserted into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the four or five lower cervical vertebra.

It arises from the transverse processes ot the fourth, fifth, and sixth dorsal, and the articular processes of the three or four lower cervical vertebra, and is inserted by a flat tendon into the back part of the mastoid process beneath the spienius.| * CaUed 'anapophyses ' by Professor Owen. skeUot°''jf° "7 transceBdental Bomenclature of the vertebrate l ot. 7^ ""^f^^^'^^'l' foUowing quotation, the plan upon which the muscles of the back are arranged:— x- r 'The muscles of the back are either longitudinal or oblique; that is, they either pass vemcaUy downwards from spinous process to spinous process, &om rajophys d ano 7 T' " (Pleurapophyses), &c., or they extend obHqudy from diapophys.s to spme, or from diapophysis to pleurapophysis, &c. ^ to JLVbT f r '^""^"'^ °' P'*^"^^ °' longitudinal fibres aggregated te!^ °" P"^"*^ °^ tl^^ spines and pos- h d of t ill ^^'^T'?"-^ ^^"""^^^^ ^'S'^"^^"'^' posterior lonilis d^ir • sacro-lumbalisLd the ' The former, arising from the iliac crest, or from the pleurapophysis (rib) of the lulr? s'tse^^^^^^ (') tHe'aplL of^ttltunS lumbar nbs, close to the tendinous origins of the transversalis abdominis; (2.) the

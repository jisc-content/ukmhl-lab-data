ANATOMY OF THE LIVEK. 424 the' inter-lohular veins' (fig. 92). Some inter-lobular veins are also derived from branches (vaginal veins) of the portal vein, which before passing between the lobules ramify in Glisson's capsule. A minute capillary network arises from the inter-lobular veins, and penetrates into the interior of the ^ lobules, in the centre of which it lONQiTUDiNAL SECTIONS OF THE coUocts iuto a slugle trunlc called the LOBULES OF TiiE LivEH.

THE suD-LOBULAR. vclu opcns into a suo-lobular vein, larger or smaller as the case may be, upon which the lobule is sessile (fig. 93). The sub-lobular veins empty themselves into the smaller hepatic veins ; these unite to form the main hepatic trunks which open into the inferior vena cava. The hepatic artery, entering the liver at the transverse fissure, divides and subdivides with the portal vein, and ramifies with it between the lobules. The artery distributes branches which supply the coats of the hepatic vessels, Glisson's capsule, and the capsule of the liver; other branches run between the lobules, pass into their substance, and terminate in the capillary network. The hepatic ducts form a close network round the circumference of each lobule. From this network, branches proceed on all sides, and accompany the portal vein. Doubt still exists as to the commencement of the ducts. The prevalent opinion is that they beo-in within the lobules by a minute plexus, surrounded by hepatic cells. The interior of each lobule, that is, the space left between the several vessels, is filled by the hepatic cells. They are nucleated, and have a diameter varying from ^^th to ^^th of an inch. They contain more or less granular matter, and m some cases fat globules : when these accumulate in large quantities, they constitute what is called a ' fatty liver.' The office of these cells is to separate the bile from the blood, and when filled with bile, discharge their contents into the hepatic ducts.* * For further information on this subject see the original observations of Kiernan in the Philosoph.

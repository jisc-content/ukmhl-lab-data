DISSECTION OF THE EYE. 562 the union of the sclerotica and the cornea. It serves as the con- necting medium between several structures—namely, the choroid, the iris, the ciliary processes, and the sclerotica. Between the sclerotic, the cornea, and the ciliary ligament, is placed a minute circular canal, termed the sinus circulaHs iridis or canal of Schlemm (fig. 134). It is probably a venous sinus, for it can always be injected from the arteries. Fig. 135. Sclerotic coat . . . Veins of tlieclioroid . Ciliiu-y nerves . . . Veins o£ the choroid . SCLKROTIC COAT EEMOVED TO SHOW THE CHOEOID, CILIARY LIGAMENT, AND NERVES. Ciliary muscle, This muscle consists of unstriped fibres, and is attached to the line of junction of the sclerotic and cornea; thence its fibres radiate backwards over the ciUary ligament, and are lost in the choroid behind the ciliary processes?* Its action is probably to accommodate the eye to ob- jects at various distances, by rendering the lens more or less convex. The iris is a movable curtain suspended m the clear fluid, which occupies the space between the cornea and crystalline lens. The iris divides this space into two unequal parts, called the anterior and posterior chambers {^g. 134); these » Sir Philip Crampton has noticed that this muscle is well developed in birds. In them its fibres are of the striped kind, just as the circxUar fibres of the ins are.

FEMALE PERINEUM. 407 essentially similar, iu origin and arrangement, to that which surrounds the membranous part of the urethra in the male. It also passes through the triangular ligament (fig. 89, p. 410). Though the prostate gland is wanting, yet there are minute glands scattered all round it, especially near the neck of the bladder. In consequence of the wider span of the pubic arch, and the more yielding nature of the surrounding structures, the female urethra is much more dilatable than the male. By means of a sponge tent, it may be safely dilated to admit the easy passage of the fore-finger into the bladder. Advantage is taken of this great dilatability in the extraction of calculi from the bladder. The mucous coat of the urethra is arranged in longitudinal folds, Fig. 88. 1.

Next to the mucous coat is a layer of elastic and non-striped muscular fibres intermixed. Out- side all is a plexus of veins bearing a strong resemblance to erectile tissue. Va-ina. "^^^ Vagina is the canal which leads to the uterus; at present, only the orifice of it can be seen. It is surrounded by a sphincter muscle, easily displayed by removing the integument. The muscle is about three-fourths of an inch broad, and connected with the cutaneous sphincter of the anus in such a manner that they together form something like the figure 8. -D ,u ^ ^^^^ ^^^^ °f orifice of the vagina, between the Bulb of the , ■, , , » ' vagina.

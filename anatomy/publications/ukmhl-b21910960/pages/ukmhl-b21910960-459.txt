Proceeding down the thigh, it penetrates, on either side of the limb, to the linea aspera, forming what are called the 'intermuscular septa,' which separate the extensor from the flexor muscles. Below, it can be traced all round the knee-joint, and is particularly strong, es- pecially on the outer side, where it is attached to the head of the tibia and fibula. There are numerous small apertures in the fascia, through which the cutaneous nerves and vessels are transmitted; and one large opening —the 'saphenous opening^—through which the saphena vein passes to join the femoral. That part of the fascia lata situated external to the saphenous opening is termed the iliac portion of the fascia lata; that internal to it, the pubic portion. The saphenous opening is an oval aperture in the fascia lata, situated immediately below the crural arch, on the inner side of the front aspect of the thigh. There is no definite edge to the saphenous opening until the fascia, which covers the opening and blends with its margin, has been removed.* The term 'cribriform ' has been ""^^"^ ™^ , , 1 • P . , . .

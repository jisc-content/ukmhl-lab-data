140 DISSECTION OF THE LAUYNX. The os-hyoides is connected to the thyroid cartilage by several ligaments, which contain a quantity of elastic tissue There is: 1 The anterior thyro-hyoid, which proceeds from the notch ot the thyroid cartilage to the upper and-posterior part of the body o the os-hyoides. In front of this ligament there is, m the per ect larynx, a bursa of considerable size, of which the nse is to facilitate the play of the thyroid cartilage behind the os-hyoides 2. Ihe rio-ht and left lateral thyro-hyoid ligaments extend between the extremities of the greater cornua of the o|-hyoides and the ascend- ing cornua of the thyroid cartilage. They often contain a little nodule of cartilage. The space between the hyold bone and the Thyroid cartilage ?s closed in the recent state by the %ro-/^-cZ Jer>^brane. Through this membrane the superior laryngeal neive and artery enter the larynx. The framework of the larynx is composed of hve Cartilages of cartilages connected by joints and elastic ligaments, so the larynx. ^^^^ ^ ^^^^^ ^^p^^ ^^^^ ^ther by appropriate muscles; the object of this motion being to act upon two el^tic ligaments called the "vocal cords," upon which the voice essen tiallydepends^^^^ so called because it shields the beautiful Thyroid mechanism behind.it. It consists of two lateral halves (al^) united at an acute angle which forms the pro- Tuinence termed "Pomum Adami."

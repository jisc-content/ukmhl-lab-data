MALE PERINEUM. 337 physis pubis (fig. 68). • Within tliis distance from the symphysis the bladder may be tapped in the linea alba, without risk of wounding the peritoneum. Thus, the surgeon has the choice of two situations in which he may tap the bladder,—above the pubes, or from the rectum. Which of the two be the more appropriate must be decided by the circumstances of the case. Fig. 69. DISSECTION OF THE MALE PEEINEUM. Examine first the osseous and ligamentous boundaries of the lower aperture of the pelvis. Looking at a male pelvis (with the ligaments preserved), we observe that this aperture is of a lozenge shape; that it is bounded in front by the symphysis of the pubes, laterally by the rami of the pubes and ischium; behind by the coccyx and the great sacro-ischiatic ligaments. This space, for convenience of description, is divided into two by an imagmary line drawn from one tuber ischii to the other. The anterior' forms a nearly equilateral triangle, of which the sides are from three to three and a half inches long; and since it transmits the urethra, we call it the urethral division of the perineum. The posterior, containing the anus, is called the anal division (fig. 69, 1, 2).* The subject is supposed to be placed in the usual position for lithotomy, with a full-sized staff in the bladder, and the rectum artificially distended. Observe that a central ridge, named the ra'phe, extends from the anus along the peri- neum the scrotum, and the under surface of the penis.

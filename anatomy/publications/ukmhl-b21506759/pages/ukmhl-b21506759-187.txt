GANGLION OF ANDERSCH. 173 described by Miiller.* It is found upon the nerve immediately after its entrance into the canal of the dura mater, and is so small that its size does not in any dii-ection exceed of an inch. It occupies the outer side of the nerve, and does not implicate all its fibres. According to my observation, this ganglion is frequently absent. It is not introduced in the following diagram.

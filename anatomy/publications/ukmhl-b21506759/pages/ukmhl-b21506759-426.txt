412 THE DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. An incision should be made along the groin from the spine of the ilium to that of the pubes; another, from the middle of the first, perpendicularly downwards for about six inches. Eeflecting the skin, we expose the sub-cutaneous adi- fascia^'^^'^^ pose ^.nd connective tissue, called the " superficial fascia." Its thickness varies accoj-ding to the condition of the body. It is described as being divisible into layers. The truth is, that any one who is dexterous with the scalpel can make as many layers as he pleases. Your object must be to have a clear view of the superficial absorbent glands and the cutaneous vessels which are imbedded in this fascia, and ramify in three directions. One ascends over the surface of the abdomen, another towards the pubes, a third towards the ilium; they are named the superficial epigastric, the superficial pudic, and the superficial circumfiexa ilii arteries (fig. 91). All three come from the femoral. Each is accompanied by one, sometimes by two veins, which empty them- selves, either directly into the femoral vein, or into the great cutaneous vein of the thigh, called the "saphena." Femoral These are easily recognised, by their reddish-brown absorbent colour. Most of them are situated along the outer side glands. ^j^g saphena. They vary in number, and are of an oval form, with the long axis vertical. In a well-injected sub- ject we observe how freely they are supplied with blood-vessels; hence the rapidity with which they enlarge when inflamed. They transmit the absorbents from nearly all parts of the lower ex- tremity. They also receive some of the absorbents from the scrotum. This explains why, in some cases of chimney-sweeper's

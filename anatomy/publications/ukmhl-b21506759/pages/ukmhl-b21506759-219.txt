Subsea u '^^^^ muscle occupies the internal surface of the scapula, li^is!'^''^''' It arises from the internal surface of the scapula, and terminates in a strong tendon, which passes under the axillary vessels and nerves, over the inner side of the shoulder- joint, and is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus. Its action is to rotate the humerus inwards. Serratus "^^^^ muscle covers the side of the chest like a girth, magmis. It arises by digitations from the eight upper ribs. Its fibres converge and are inserted into the posterior border of the scapula. Its action is to draw the scapula forwards: but of this more hereafter. It is supplied by the following nerve which you see on its outer surface. External "^^^^ supplies the serratus magnus only.

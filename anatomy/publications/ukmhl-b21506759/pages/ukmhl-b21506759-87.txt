INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. 73 This great nerve is the largest of the three divisioas of m^uLj the fifth cerebral nerve. It differs from the other two nerve and (Jivrisions, i. 6. the ophthalmic and the superior maxillary, in that it contains motor as well as sensitive filaments; the motor being furnished by the small non-ganglionic root of the fifth nerve. Thus much of its physiology it is necessary to know, in order to imderstand the extensive distribution of the nerve; for we shall find that the motor portion supplies all the mu-scles con- cerned in the movements of the lower jaw * ; whilst the other portion confers only common sensibility upon the parts to which it is distributed. The nerve, then, composed of sensitive and motor filaments, emerges from the skull through the foramen ovale as a single thick trunk, under the name of the inferior maxillary. It lies directly external to the Eustachian tube: it is covered by the external pterygoid muscle, which should be turned on one side to expose it. Immediately after its exit fi-om the skull, the nerve divides into its several branches; some, destined for the muscles, contain motor as well as sensitive filaments; others are pm'ely sensitive.

The branch to the masseter runs outwards above the external pterygoid, through the sigmoid notch of the jaw. * Excepting the genio-hyoidei muscles, which ai-c supplied by the hyiDoglossal nerve.

319 BRANCHES Or ABDOMINAL AORTA. The colic branches of the superior mesenteric are—the right colic, which proceeds towards the ascending colon, and the middle colic, which ascends between the layers of the meso-colon to the arch. They are arranged after the same plan as those of the small intestines; that is, they inosculate so as to form a series of arches which successively decrease in size, and finally terminate in circles round the bowel. Eemember that the superior mesenteric vein joins the splenic behind the pancreas, and forms the vena portse (p. 316). Inferior artery, the small intestines must be mesenteric drawn over towards the right side. It is given off about toSes!'^ .'"^^^^^ ^^o'^^ bifurcation of the aorta. Descend- ing into the pelvis over the left common iliac artery, it passes between the layers of the meso-rectum, and, taking the name of superior hemorrhoidal, is finally distributed to the upper part of the rectum. Its branches are—1. the colica sinistra, which supplies the descending colon; 2. the sigmoidea, which supplies the sigmoid flexure. These inosculate in the form of arches. The colica sinistra, too, forms a large arterial arch with the colica media, so that there is a chain of arterial communications from one end to the other of the intestinal canal (fig. 64). The inferior mesenteric vein joins the splenic behind the pancreas. In order to. complete our knowledge of the position of the duo- denum and the pancreas, a ligature should now be placed on the upper end of the jejunum, another on the lower end of the sig- moid flexure of the colon, and the intermediate portions of the small and large intestine should be removed. By simply tm-ning up the stomach we expose at once the horse-shoe course of the duo- denum round the great end of the pancreas, and the several rela- tions of this portion of the alimentary canal described (p. 304).

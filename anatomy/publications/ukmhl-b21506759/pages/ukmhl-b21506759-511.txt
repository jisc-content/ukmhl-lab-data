497 CORPUS CALLOSUM. arched from before backwards. One or more longitudinal ridges, called by the old anatomists the "raphe" run along the middle of it (fig. 118). In a fresh brain we can evidently see the transverse fibres, of which the commissure is composed, extending between the hemispheres; these are the " linece transversca" of the old anatomists. Notice also the anterior cerebral arteries. The anterior part of the corpus callosum turns downwards and backwards, forming a bend called its knee, towards the base of the Fig. 118.

It becomes gradually thinner, and terminates in two peduncles, which diverge from each other, and are lost, one in each fissure of Sylvius. Between these crura is placed the lamina cinerea (fig. 119). The posterior part of the corpus callosum terminates in a thick round border, under which the pia mater enters into the interior of the ventricles. We cannot obtain a satisfactory view of the arch formed by the corpus callosum, of its terminations in front and behind, and of the relative thickness of K K.

Its tendinous fibres take the same direction as the muscle; they do not, however, stop at the middle line, or linea alba, but cross over those of the oppo- site side; a decussation which makes the aponeurosis all the -X, stronp-er.

This, which is termed'the crural arch^, transmits the great vessels of the thigh, with muscles and nerves, which will be examined here- after. Near the pubes is an opening in the aponeurosis for the passage of the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament of the uterus in the female. It is called the " external abdominal ring." Of this, as well as of the crural arch, you must postpone more particular examination till you come to the parts concerned in inguinal hernia. The external oblique should be carefully detached from the ribs and the crest of the ilium, and turned forwards as far as this can be done without injuring its aponeurosis or the crural arch. In this way the second muscular stratum will be exposed. This muscle arises from the outer half of the crural Internal g^j.^^ and from the anterior two-thirds of the crest of the obHque. -i"^^^ Prom these attachments the fibres ascend ob- liquely, and are inserted partly into the abdominal aponeurosis, ■ partly into the cartilages of the three or four lower ribs.J * From its position and tlie direction of its fibres, it is manifest that the external obHque represents, in the abdomen, the external intercostal muscles of the chest t This was first described by Fallopius, an ItaUan anatomist, in his " Obsei-rationes Anatomic^," published in 1561. It was subsequently described by Poupart in l<0o in the "M6m. de I'Acad. de Paris," and is now commonly caUed in the scJiools " Poupart's ligament." . * i loo i The internal oblique represents in the abdomen the iaternal intercostal muscies of the chest.

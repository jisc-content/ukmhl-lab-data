INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. •0 sected by tendinous septa for the purpose of giving origin to muscular fibre. The action of the pterygoid muscles is to produce the lateral movement of the jaw essential to the proper mastication of the food. Consequently we find them enormously developed in all ruminants, and comparatively feeble in carnivorous animals. Disarticulate the condyle of the jaw with its fibro-cartilage from the crlenoid cavity, and turn it forwards with the external pterygoid, so that the condyle can be replaced if desirable. A little dissection will bring into view the internal maxillary artery. This is one of the terminal branches into which the LtSJiy external carotid divides opposite the neck of the jaw. _ It arteiy. ^^^^ horizontaUy forwards between the neck of the jaw and the internal lateral ligament; it then runs tortuously in some cases above, in others beneath the external pterygoid, enters the spheno-maxiUary fossa between the two heads of the external pterygoid, and terminates by dividing into several branches. We divide the course of this artery into three stages. In the first stage, the artery lies between the neck of the jaw and the internal lateral ligament; in the second stage, it lies either oyer or under the external pterygoid; in the third stage, it lies m the spheno-maxillary fossa.

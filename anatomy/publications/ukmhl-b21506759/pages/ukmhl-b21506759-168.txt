154 DISSECTION OF THE SCALP. (aponeurosis of the scaJp) ; 4, an abundance of loose areolar tissue, which permits the free motion of the scalp upon, 5, the pencramum, or periosteum of the skull-cap. Immediately beneath the skin, then, we expose the thm stratum of adipose tissue which connects it to the aponeurosis of the scalp. It forms a bed for the bulbs of the hair and for the ramifications of the cutaneous arteries. The toughness of this tissue, m which the arteries ramify, does not readily permit them to retract when divided; hence the hemorrhage which follows incised wounds ot the scalp: hence, also, the difficulty of dramng them out wath the forceps. The blood-vessels of the scalp are derived, m front, t:llZu,r.-or^^^l arteries; on the sides, from tl^e »1; behind, from the occipital and posterior auricular. Trace the leadTn. trunks, and observe that they subdivide mto branches, Ithlnosci^aie freely, and finally form a vascular -twork among the bulbs of the hair. A few small branches here and there dip down through the aponeurosis of the scalp to the pericranium. The veins accompany the arteries. This cutaneous muscle is closely connected to the scalp. It consists of two fleshy portions one on the --«<=1- occiput, the other on the forehead, connected by a bioad The oricrin of the muscle takes place from the outer "^"""^rrnf^^^ ZlfcLe on the occipital bone, and the ad- :iingt^ P-ess. The'fibres ascend over the Ck of the head, and terminate in the common aponeurosis. The ttri portion, commencing in an arched form the _ transverse wrinkles in the expression of surprise. Like the muscles of expression it is supplied by the facial nerve.

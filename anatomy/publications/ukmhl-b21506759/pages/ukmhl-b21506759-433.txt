The muscles are separated from the vessels by a strong vertical fibrous partition passing from the arch to the bone, which is nothing more than a continuation of the sheath of the psoas. The aa-tery, too, is separated from the vein hj^ a similar, although a much weaker partition, and there is a third'close to the inner side of the vein. These three partitions not only keep all the parts in their right place, but confine the arch down to the bone, and prevent its being uplifted by any protrusion between it and the muscles and vessels. This, coupled with the close attachment of the iliac fascia to the crural arch, explains why a femoral hernia cannot take place in any other situation than on the inner side of the femoral vein.* * If the partitions from any cause yield, or tecome slack, tlien a rupture may de- ofThe'^tery* °' '^^''"^'^^ ^^"^ °^ side

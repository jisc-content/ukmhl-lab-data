LIGAMENTS OK THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. 481 Fig. IIL foot ? An enormously strong and elastic ligament which scaphoid." extends from the os calcis to the os scaphoides (fig. 111). These bones, together with the ligament, form a com- plete socket for the reception of the head of the astragalus; it is this joint, and not the ankle, which permits the abduction and adduc- tion of the foot. The chief peculiarity about the ligament alluded to is its elasticity. It acts in all respects like a spring, and allows to the key-stone of the arch a certain amount of play which is obviously of great service in preventing concussion of the body. Whenever this liga- ment loses its elastic property, as is often the case with those who are in the habit of carrying heavy burdens, the arch of the foot gradually yields, and the individual becomes flat-footed. The OS calcis articulates with the os cuboides pretty nearly on a line with the articulation between the astragalus and the os scaphoides. The bones are most firmly connected by means of a powerful ligament in the sole, called the calcaneo-cuboid, or " ligaraentum longum plantae." Some of its fibres extend forwards as far as the third and fourth metatarsal bones. It would be only tedious repetition to enumerate individually the several ligaments which connect the remaining bones of the tarsus and metatarsus. Let it then suflSce to say, that they are firmly braced together hj very strong ligaments, both on their dorsal and their plantar surfaces, and by interosseous ligaments which extend between their contiguous surfaces, like rivets. Though there is very little motion between any two bones, the collective amount is such that the foot is enabled to adapt itself accurately to the ground; pressure is more equally distributed, aud consequently there is a I I Calcaneo cuboid. 1.

RECTO-VESICAL POUCH. 335 the bladder be empty, there will also be some of the small intes- tines in the pelvis; not so if the bladder be distended. The rectum enters the pelvis on the left side of the the^ecton s^^"^^^"^? ^^^j ^^^^^ describing a curve corresponding with the concavity of the sacrum, terminates at the anus. Observe, that, in the first part of its course, it is loosely connected to the back of the pelvis by a peritoneal fold, called the " meso- redum;" and that between the layers of this fold the terminal branches (superior heemorrhoidal) of the inferior mesenteric vessels with nerves and absorbents run to the bowel. It is worth remembering that the rectum does not take this course in all cases; sometimes it makes one, or even two lateral curves. In some rare cases it enters the pelvis on the right side instead of the left. Since these variations from the usual arrange- ment cannot be ascertained during life, they should make us cautious in the introduction of bougies ; for such things have hap- pened as a perforation of the intestine by a bougie.* Whilst the parts are still undisturbed, you should poucL^^''"''^ introduce the finger into what is called the recto-vesical peritoneal pouch (fig. 68). This is a cul-de-sac formed by the peritoneum in passing from the front of the rectum to the lower and back part of the bladder. Now, in the adult male subject, the bottom of this pouch is about one inch distant from the base of prostate gland f : therefore a part of the under surface of the bladder is not covered by peritoneum; and since this part is in immediate contact with the rectum, it is practicable to tap the distended bladder through the front of the bowel without injuring the peritoneum. The operation has, of late years, been revived by surgeons of good repute, and with great success, J It is easily done, and not attended with much risk, provided all the parts be in their regular position. But this is not always the case.

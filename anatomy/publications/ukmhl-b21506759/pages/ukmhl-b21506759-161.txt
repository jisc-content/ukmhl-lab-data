DISSECTION OP THE LARYNX. 147 M. thyro arytenoi- deus. This muscle arises from the angle of the thyroid cartilage, runs horizontally backwards and is inserted into the front surface of the base of the arytenoid. Its fibres run parallel with the vocal cord, and some of them are directly inserted into it. Part of the muscle spreads out so as to form a floor for the ventricle of the larynx, and is inserted into the outer border of the arytenoid cartilage. Nerve from the inferior laryngeal. This muscle relaxes the vocal cord. More than this, it puts the lip of the glottis in the « vocalizing" position; in this position, the hps of the glottis are parallel, and the chink is reduced to the breadth of a shilHng.* Kg. 31.

Dissection 6i* the palm of the hand. 54t then divide a second time into two slips, which interlace, with- each other and are inserted into the sides of the second phalanx. The deep flexor, having passed through the opening of the super- ficial one, is inserted into the base of the last phalanx.* In what way are the tendons supplied with blood ? Eaise and separate the tendons, and you will see that slender folds of synovial membrane (vincula tendinum) run up from the phalanges to the tendons; when minutely injected, these folds are full of blood- vessels. The tendon of the flexor longus jpolUcis lies on the radial side of the other tendons beneath the annular ligament. It passes between the two portions of the flexor brevis pollicis and the two sesamoid bones of the thumb, enters its proper sheath, and is inserted into the base of the last phalanx. Its synovial sheath is prolonged from the large bursa of the flexor tendons beneatJa the annular ligament, and accompanies it down to the last joint of the thumb ; consequently the sheath is injured in amputation of the last phalanx. Bursal sac of ^ ^^^^^ synovial sac, called the bursa of the tie carpus.° carpus, facilitates the play of the tendons beneath the • anterior annular ligament. It lines the under surface of the ligament and the groove of the carpus, and is reflected in loose folds over the-tendons. It is prolonged up the tendons for an inch and a half, or two inches, and forms a "cul-de-sac" above the ligament. Below the ligament the bursa extends into the palm, and sends off" prolongations for each of the flexor tendons, which accompany them down to the middle of the hand. You will easily understand that, when the bursa is inflamed and distended by fluid here will be a bulging above the annular ligament, and another in the palm, with perceptible fluctuation between them; the unyield- ing ligament causing a constriction in the centre.f passage along the phalanges the Z^^^fTj^l T^^ T"^'"; -^'^^ ^^'^ patella for the supei-flcial one - but at the T / i Arst phalanx a kind of little deeper than the i,the, and fo'nns 1 le ^Stlt Th" ■nical ingenuity to increase the leverage in each c-isc ^''"'^ t I hare met with only one instance in which this h,.v.. ^ wmcu tills biu-sa communicated with tho

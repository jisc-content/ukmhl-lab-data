.DISSECTION OF THE AXILLA. 209 b. The postenor branch (dorsalis scapulse), runs to the back of the scapula, through a triangular space bounded by the long head of the triceps, the teres major and subscapularis (5, fig. 43). On the back of the scapula, it divides into branches, which ramify close to the bone, supplying the infra-spinatus and* teres minor. But its largest branch inosculates freely with the supra-scapular artery (from the subclavian). This is the principal channel through which the coUateral circulation is carried on after ligature of the subclavian in the third part of its course. (See diagram, p. 45.) The subscapular vein empties itself into the axillary vein. Subscapxilar ^^^^ "'^'"''^^ ''^"^'^ "subscapular " are found on the. nerves. surface of the subscapularis. They come from the posterior part of the axillary plexus, and supply re- spectively the latissimus dorsi, teres major, and subscapularis. The nerve for the latissimus dorsi (called the long subscapular), runs with the anterior branch of the subscapular artery. The nerve for the teres major is either a branch of the preced- ing, or comes distinct from the plexus. It lies nearer to the humerus than the long subscapular. The proper nerve of the subscapularis arises from the plexus higher than the others.

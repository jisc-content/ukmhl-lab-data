71 INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. The middle meningecd artery ascends between the two roots of the temporo-auricular nerve through the foramen spinosum into Fig. 11. Third stage. Second stage.

The meningea parva ascends through the foramen ovale into the skull, and supplies chiefly the ganglion of the fifth pair. It often comes from the meningea media. The inferior dental artery descends behind the neck of the jaw to the dental foramen, which it enters in company with the dental nerve. It then proceeds through a canal in the diploe to the sym- physis, where it minutely inosculates with its fellow. In this canal, which runs beneath the roots of all the teeth, the artery gives branches which ascend through the little apertures in the fangs, â€¢and ramify upon the pulp in their interior. Opposite the foramen mentale arises the mental branch already described (jp. 65). Before entering the jaw the dental artery furnishes a small branch which accompanies the nerve proceeding to the mylo-hyoid muscle. The masseteric branch passes through the sigmoid notch of the r 4

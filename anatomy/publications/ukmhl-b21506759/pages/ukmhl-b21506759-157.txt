DISSECTION OF THE LARYNX. 143 account of its peculiar organization which resembles that of the ear and the nose. Let us now examine the larynx in its perfect condition. Mucous The mucous membrane of the larynx presents a Sar^nx"^ Wrinkled appearance, except where it lines the vocal cords, and is connected to the subjacent structures by an abundance of fine cellular tissue, which admits of its bei'ncr pmched up into large folds. This tissue deserves notice from the rapidity with which it becomes the seat of serous effusion in.acute inflammation of the larynx, and thus produces sudden and alarm- ing symptoms of suffocation. From the root of the tongue to the epiglottis the membrane forms three folds (glosso-epiglottidean) contaming elastic tissue. From the epiglottis it is continued backwards on either side to the apices of the arytenoid cartilao-es forming the " aryteno-epiglottidean" folds, which bound the entrance into the larynx. In the natural state it is of a pale rose colour, and covered by ciliated epithelium. The mucous membrane of the larynx is remarkable for its acute sensibility. This is requisite to guard the glottis during the passage of the food over it. The glottis is closed during the act of ori:rtL'i i'^''''''''^^^-pt 'o ;eak or laugh the glottis opens, and allows the food to go, as t is termed, the wrong way.

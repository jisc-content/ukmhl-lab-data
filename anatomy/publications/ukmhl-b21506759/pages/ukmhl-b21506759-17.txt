In opening the external jugular vein, remember that the punc- ture should be made in the dii-ection of the fibres of the sterno- mastoid muscle. The fibres of the platysma^ divided obliquely, will be less likely to contract over the orifice.

It commences by small branches below the chin, and runs down the front of the neck, nearly to the sternum: it then curves outwards, beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle, and opens into the external jugular, or perhaps the sub- clavian vein. We commonly meet with two anterior jugular veins, one on either side; immediately above the sternum they com- municate by a transverse branch. D 2

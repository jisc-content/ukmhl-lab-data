527 ORiaiN OF THE CEREBRAL NERVES. account for single vision, since the right halves and the left halves of the eyes would derive their nerve-fibres from the same optic nerve. Th" d < ir -^^^ apparent origin of the third nerve is from the or motor^' inner side of the crus cerebri, immediately in front of oculorum. ^j^^ ^^^^. j.QQ^g penetrate into the crus as deep as the locus niger (p. 525). It passes through the sphenoidal fissure, and supplies all the muscles of the eye, except the superior oblique and the rectus externus. The fourth nerve arises from the valve of Vieussens orTaietid (P- ^0'^)' ^^^^ transversely outwards, winds round the crus cerebri, enters the orbit through the sphe- noidal fissure, and supplies the superior oblique muscle of the eye. . The fifth nerve arises by two roots of unequal size, or trigeminal The apparent origin of both is from the side of the pons (p. 512); but their real origin is much deeper. The smaller and more anterior of the two consisting of motor fibres only, may be traced into the pyramidal tract in the pons; the posterior and larger root, consisting of purely sensitive fibres, may be traced into the restiform tract of the medulla. The nerve proceeds forwards over the apes of the petrous portion of the tem- poral bone: here is developed vipon the sensitive root the great Gasserian ganglion. This root then divides into three branches; the ophthalmic, which passes through the orbital fissure ; the superior maxillary, which passes through the foramen rotundum; the in- ferior maxillary, which passes through the foramen ovale. They all confer common sensibility upon the parts they supply, which com- prise nearly the entire head. The small motor root accompanies the inferior maxillary division of the sensitive root, and is distri-. buted to the muscles of mastication. The sixth nerve arises from the medulla oblongata, aScei!"' close to the pons (p. 512), leaves the skull through the sphenoidal fissure, and supplies the rectus externus of the eye. The seventh consists of two distinct nerves â€” the Seventhpair. ^^^.^^^ duva, or muscular nerve of the face, and the

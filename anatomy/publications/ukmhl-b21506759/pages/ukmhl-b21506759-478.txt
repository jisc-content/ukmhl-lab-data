SOLE OF THE FOOT. 464 fibula, and then over the articulation between the tibia and fibula to the outer part of the os calcis, where it inosculates with the malleolar and plantar arteries. Observe that all down the leg it is imbedded among the muscles: for it is covered first by the soleus, and afterwards by the flexor longus pollicis. To both these muscles, but to the latter especially, it sends numerous branches, and just above the ankle it gives off a constant one, which runs in front of the tibio-fibular articulation, and inosculates with the other malleolar arteries. Posterior "^^^^ continuation of the popliteal. It descends tibial close to its Corresponding artery, and, entering the sole of the foot, divides into an external and internal plantar nerve. Eespecting its precise position with regard to the artery, observe, that jn the first part of its course the nerve lies superficial to the artery, and rather to its inner side; but behind the ankle the nerve lies on the outer side of the artery, and on the same plane.* Its branches supply the three deep-seated muscles. DISSECTION OF THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. Make a perpendicular incision down the middle of the sole, and reflect the skin. Notice the peculiar structure of the subcutaneous tissue. It is composed of globular masses of fat, separated by strong fibrous septa, and forms an elastic pad. This is especially marked at the heel, and at the ball of the great and the Uttle toe ; these being the points which form the tripod supporting the arch of the foot. In removing the subcutaneous tissue from the ball of the great and the little toe, we often meet with bursae, simple or multilocular. They are generally placed between the skin and the sesamoid bones, a.nd have remarkably thick walls. Very frequently we trace an * It sometimes happens that the nerve divides into its two plantar branohea higher than usual, and then we find that one lies on either side of the artery.

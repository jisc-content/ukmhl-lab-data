304 POSITION OF ABDOMINAL VISCERA. contained within the cnrve of the duodenum: its left end extends as far as the spleen. . The kidneys are situated in the lumhar region, nearly opposite the two lower dorsal and the two upper lumbar vertebrae. They lie imbedded in fat, partly upon the quadratus lumborum, partly upon the psoas. In contact with the right kidney, we have the Uver, the second part of the duodenum, and the ascending colon; in contact with the left, are the spleen, the end of the pancreas, and the descending colon. This body is situated at the top of the kidney, it Eenal capsule. ^^^^ ^^^^ diaphragm.

360 SIDE VIEW OE THE PELVIC VISCEEA. The wide, that is the transverse diameter, is ahout one inch and a half- the vertical is about half an inch less. But the gland varies in size at different periods of life. In the child it is not developed, or at all events is very small: it gradually grows to- wards puberty, and increases in size with advancing age. • When you wish to ascertain the size and condition of the prostate during life, the bladder should be at least half full: because the prostate is then pressed down towards the rectum, and more withm reach of the finger. t>,p The urethra, in its passage under the arch ot tne STetXf pubes, is surrounded by muscular fibres ; this, therefore in its pas- may very properly be called the "muscular" part oi ?hf the urethra, though it commonly goes by the name of the' «membranous." It comprises that part ot the canal intermediate between the prostate and the bulb. It is about one inch in length, but somewhat longer on the upper than the lower surface, in consequence of the encroachment oi the bulb. It is about an inch below the symphysis pubis, and nearly the same distance from the rectum; observe, however, that it is not equidistant from the rectum at all points, because of the downward bend which the gut makes towards the anus. This muscle supports the anus and lower part oi the Levator ani. ^^^^^^ ^.^^ ^ ^-^^^^ To see it, the pelvic fascia mnst be reflected from its inner surface.

398 ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. the lobule. This central vein opens at once into an hepatic vein termed " siib-lobular," larger or smaller as the case may be, upon which the lobule is sessile. Thus, then, on a perpendicular section, we should see the hepatic veins running into the central vein, like the side veins of an oak leaf do into the midrib (fig. 87); while on a transverse section, they would present a starred appearance. a. Inter-lobular vein. b. Intra-lobular vein. TKANSVEESE SECTIONS OF THEEE LOBUIES OF THE LIYEB, MAGNOTEB TO SHO^ THE POBTAIi VENOUS PLEXUS. (After Kiernan.) And now a word or two respecting the ultimate ramifications of the hepatic artery and the hepatic duct. The hepatic artery, entering the liver at the transverse fissure, divides and subdivides with the portal vein, and ultimately rami- fies with it between the lobules. A few only of the arterial capil- laries enter the lobules. The chief office of the artery appears to be, to supply the coats of the other vessels of the liver,â€”m other words, the machinery of the organ. The hepatic ducts commence within the lobules by numerous ramifications, which form a close network near the circumference of each lobule. From this network branches proceed on all sides, and accompany the portal veins.

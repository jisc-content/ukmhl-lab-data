45 BRANCHES OF THE SUBCLAVIAN. upper intercostal spaces. It usually \nosculates with the first intercostal branch of the aorta. The corresponding vein terminates on the right side in the vena- on the left in the Fig. 7. azygos; vena innominata. This artery arises Seal. the superior intercostal, seldom direct from the subclavian. It goes to the back of the neck between the first rib and the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra, and ascends between the complexus and the semi- spinalis colli, both of which it supplies. It sometimes inosculates with the " prin- ceps cervicis," a branch of the occipital a. If you wish to test yovxr knowledge of the branches of the siibclavian artery, reflect upon the answer to the following question: If the artery were tied in the first part of its course before it gives off any branches, how would the arm be sup- plied with blood ? The an- swer is,by five collateral channels, as follow: —1. By the com- mumcations between the superior and inferior thyroid • 2 By the communication between the two vertebral: 3. By the communi cations between the internal mammary on the one hand, and the mtercostals and the epigastric on the other : 4. By the communica- tions between the thoracic branches of the axillary, and the DIAGBAM TO SHOTV THE DTOSCULATIONS OF THE SXJBCXAVIAN AETEBY.

CAVERNOUS SINUS. 158 sinuses run out of it; on the inner side it communicates with the circular sinus which surrounds the pituitary gland (P. in the dia- gram). Fig. 33. Third nerve . . .

DIAGEAM OF THE VENOUS SINTISES AT THE BASE OP THE SKULI-. In the outer wall of the cavernous sinus we trace from above downwards the third nerve, the fourth, and the first di^sion of he fifth on their course to the orbit.* On its mner wall we find the sixth nerve, and. the internal carotid artery. These objects are said to be contained in the cavernous sinus; but clearly understand that none of them are bathed in the blood of the smus, because they are separated from it by the lining membrane. * Such is the order in which the nerves are placed in_ the wall of the sintis. As they enter the orbit, the fourth nerve crosses over the third.

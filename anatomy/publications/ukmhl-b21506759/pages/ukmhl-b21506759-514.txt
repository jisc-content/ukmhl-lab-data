DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 500 we to remark on the floor of tlieir interior ? Beginning from the front we notice â€” 1, a grey elevation of a pyramidal form, called the corpus striatum; 2, behind this, a white elevation called the thcdamus opticus. 3. Along the boundary line between the corpus striatum and the thalamus opticus runs a slender, transparent, horn-like substance, called the tcenia semicircularis. 4. On the back part of the thalamus opticus lies a red fringe called the choroid plexus. It is formed by folds of the pia mater con- Kg. 121. 1. Corpus callosum. 2. Lateral ventricle. is.

In the middle or descending horn, the choroid plexus runs down to the base of the brain; and there is also a columnar eminence which stands out in relief on the back part of the cavity; to this the fanciful term " hippocampus major " has been applied.* 7. In the posterior horn there is a smaller elevation of the surface called the " hippocampus minor." These hippocampal elevations * The lower end of tlie hippocampus major is somewhat expanded and indented on the siirface, so as to resemble the paw of an animal. Hence the name giren to it, "27CS hippocampi."

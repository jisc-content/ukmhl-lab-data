DISSECTION OF THE UPPER ARM. 221 The eventual distribution of the median nerve is to the two pronators and all the flexors of the forearm (except the flexor carpi ulnaris and half the flexor profundus digitorum), to the muscles of the ball of the thumb, and to both sides of the thumb, fore, and middle fingers, and the radial side of the ring finger. External ^^^^ ^^^^^ (^^^^^ called musculo-CUtaneoUS, or per- cutaneous forans Casserii) arises by a common trunk with the external root of the median, on the outer side of the axillary artery. It perforates the coraco-brachialis, and then runs down between the biceps and the brachialis anticus. A little above the elbow-joint, between the tendon of the biceps and the supi- nator radii longus, the nerve becomes subcutaneous, and, passing under the median cephalic vein, divides into branches, for the supply of the integuments of the forearm. The external cutaneous nerve, in the upper part of its course, sends branches to the coraco-brachialis and the short head of the biceps, and, as it descends between the biceps and brachialis _ a. The roots may he increased in number by one on either side of the ai-tery • or the internal root may be deficient.

The nerve, formed in the usual manner, may be joined lower down by a lai-ge branch from the external cutaneous; such a case presents a junction of two large nenres in front of the brachial ai-tery, in the middle of the arm. d. The nerve in many cases crosses under, instead of over the artery ..

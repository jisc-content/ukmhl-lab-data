PAROTID GLAND. 62 qixiU: it is not easily found in the mouth, because it is concealed by a fold of mucous membrane. Since it is desirable, in operations about the face, to avoid injur- ing the parotid duct, it is well to know that the precise direction • of'the duct corresponds with a line drawn from the tip of the lobe of the ear to a point midway between the nose and the upper hp. ' Now cut into the substance of the parotid, to see the objects con- tained in its interior, which are as follow, proceeding in the order of their depth from the surface:— 1. Two or more small absorbent glands. 2. The « pes anserinus," or the primary branches of the facial 3. The external jugular vein formed by the junction of the internal maxillary and the temporal vehas. 4 The external carotid, which, after giving many branches to the gland, divides opposite the neck of the jaw, into the mternal maxillary and temporal arteries.* The absorbent glands about the parotid deserve notice, because they are liable to become enlarged, and thus to simulate disease of the parotid itself. An absorbent gland lies close to the root oi the zygoma, just in front of the cartilage of the ear; this gland is sometimes affected in disease of the external tunics of the eye ; for instance, in pmailent ophthalmia. _ The easiest way to display the plexus of nerves (pes ansermus) formed by the branches of the facial in the parotid gland, is to find one of the larger branches, say one of the malar, on the face, and then to trace this into the substance of the gland, as a clue to the others. .

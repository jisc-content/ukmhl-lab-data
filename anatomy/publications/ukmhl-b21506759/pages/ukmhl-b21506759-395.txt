FEMALE PERINEUM. 381 Tlie mucous coat of the urethra is arranged in longitudinal plicas. Next to the mucous coat, is a layer of elastic and non-striped niusculai- fibres intermixed. Outside all is a plexus of veins bear- ing a strong resemblance to erectile tissue. Vagina. '^^^ vagina is the canal which leads up to the uterus; at present only the orifice of it can be seen. It is sur- rounded by a sphincter muscle, which is easily displayed by remov- ing the integument. The muscle is about three-fourths of an inch broad, and connected with the cutaneous sphincter of the anus in such a manner that they together form something like the figure 8.

In most in- stances Its form is crescent-shaped, with the concavity upwards. But there are several varieties of hymen; sometimes there are two tegumentary folds, one on either side, so as to make the entrance of the vagma a mere vertical fissure *; or there may be a septum * Such an one may be seen in the M^.eum of the College, Phys.

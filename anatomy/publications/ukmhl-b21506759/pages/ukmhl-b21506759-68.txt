STRUCTURE OF THE EYELIDS. 54 tracted puncta, or of slitting up the lachrymal duct, it is necessary to know the exact direction of these tubes. {See diagram.) By passing a bristle into one of them, we find that it does not run straight from the punctum to the sac, but that it proceeds for a shoi-t distance perpendicularly, and then, dilating into a small pouch, makes a sharp bend inwards to the lachrymal sac. In the majority of cases, the tubes open into the sac by a common orifice. When, from any cause, the tears are secreted in greater quantity than usual, they overflow and trickle down the cheek. The eyelashes (cilia) are planted in rows along the edge of the tarsal car- tilages. The bulbs of the lashes are situated between the tarsal cartilage and the fibres of the ciliary muscle. They are supplied with blood by the palpebral branches of the ophthalmic which run paraUel and close to the free borders of the lids xmder the ciliary muscle These sebaceous glands, so called after the anatomist* who first described them, are situated on the under surface of each of the tarsal cartilages. In the upper lid there are from thirty to forty of them, not so many m the lower. On everting the lid, they are seen rumimg in longi- udinaT rows in grooves of the cartilage. Examined with he mfcroscopeyone seS that they consist of a central tube, round the Tes of wiich are a number of openings leading to short c^cal S^ltionl The orifices of these glands are situated on the free mlSn 0 the lid behind the lashes. Their use is to secrete an r tul substance, which prevents the lids ^^^^^ This name is given to a smaU reddish body situated at Carmicul.a -^^g,. corner of the eye.

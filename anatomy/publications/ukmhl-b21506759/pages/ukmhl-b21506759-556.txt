542 DISSECTION OF THE EAR. The use of the lens is to bring the rays of light to a focus upon the retina. DISSECTION OP THE OEGAN OF HEARING * The parts constituting the organ of hearing should be examined in the following order: —1. The outer cartilage; 2. The external meatus; which leads to 3. The tympanum; and lastly, the laby- rinth, or internal ear, comprising the vestibule, cochlea, and semi- cu'cular canals. Every one is familiar with the general form of the piima, or fibro-cartilage of the ear; but anatomists have given names to its different parts. The outer folded border is called the helix; the ridge within it, the ante-helix. This bifurcates towards the front, and bounds the fossa of the ante-helix. The conical eminence in front of the meatus is termed the tragus: from this, hair generally grows. Behind the tragus, and separated from it by a deep notch, is the anti-tragus. The lobule is that part from which ear-rings are suspended. The deep hollow which collects the sonorous vibrations, and directs them into the meatus, is termed the concha. The groundwork of the pinna is a fibro-cartilage, which is attached by an anterior ligament to the zygoma, and by a posterior to the mastoid process. The muscles which move the cartilage of the ear as a Muscles^ OF ^-^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ described (p. 155). Some other little muscles extend from one part of the cartilage to the other - but they are so indistinct, that, unless the body be very muscular, your attempt to find them will be made in vam. The five following are usually described by anatomists: four on the front of the pinna, and one behind it: — , +i a. The musculus major helicis runs vertically along tlie front margin of the pinna. * The iUustrations of the organ of hearing have been aJready puhUshed in my work on " Human Osteology."

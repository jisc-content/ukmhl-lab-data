LIGAMENTS OF THE LOWER JAW. 196 zygoma downwards and backwards to the tubercle of the condyle of the jaw. The internal lateral ligament extends from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone to the border of the dental foramen. This " so-called " ligament cannot in any way contribute to the strength of the joint: the articulation of one side performs the oflS.ce of internal lateral ligament to the other. The interarticidarfibro-cartilage is of an oval form, and thicker at the margin than at the centre. It is connected on the outer side to the external lateral ligament, and on the inner side some of the fibres of the external pterygoid are inserted into it. There are two synovial membranes for the joint. The larger and looser of the two is situated between the glenoid cavity and the fibro-cartilage. The other is interposed between the fibro- cartilage and the condyle of the jaw. They sometimes communi- cate through a small aperture in the centre of the fibro-cartilage. The form of the articulation of the lower jaw" admits of motion â€”upwards and downwards, forwards and backwards, and from side to side. A combination of these motions takes place in mastica- tion : during this act the condyles of the jaw describe an oblique rotatory movement upon the glenoid cavity. We see what pur- poses are served by a piece of fibro-cartilage in this curious joint: it follows the condyle, and adapts a convenient socket for all its movements: more than this, being elastic, it breaks shocks; for shocks here would be almost fatal, considering what a thin plate the glenoid cavity is, and that just above it is the brain.

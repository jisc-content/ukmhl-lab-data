MUSCLES or THE SHOULDER. 252 be tied to the coracoid process. After the removal of the arm, the precise insertion of the preceding muscles into the scapula should be carefully examined. DISSECTION OF THE MUSCLES OP THE SHOULDER. Cutaneous "^^^ outaneous nerves of the shoulder are derived nerves of the partly from the branches of the cervical plexus which sliouldei. descend over the acromion (page 3), and partly from the circumflex nerve, of -which one or two branches turn round the posterior border of the deltoid; others perforate the muscle, each accompanied by a small artery. The thin layer of fascia upon the surface of the deltoid extends from the strong aponeurosis covering the muscles on the back of the scapula, and is continuous with the fascia of the arm. It dips down between the fibres of the muscle, dividing it into large bundles. The great muscle which covers the shoulder-joint is Deltoid. j^a,nied deltoid, from its resemblance to the Greek A reversed. It arises from the external third of the clavicle, from the acromion, and from the spine of the scapula down to the triangular surface at its root. This origin, which corresponds to the insertion of the trapezius, is tendinous and fleshy everywhere, except at the commencement of the spine of the scapula, where it is simply tendinous, and connected with the infra-spinous aponeurosis. The muscvilar fibres descend, the anterior backwards, the posterior forwards, the middle perpendicularly; all converge to a tendon which is inserted into a rough surface on the outer side of the humerus, a little above the middle of the shaft. The insertion of the tendon extends one inch and a half along the humerus, and terminates in a v-shaped form, the origin of the brachialis anticus being on either side. The muscular bundles composing the deltoid have a very pecu- liar arrangement: a peculiarity arising from its broad origin and its narrow insertion. It consists in the interposition of tendons be

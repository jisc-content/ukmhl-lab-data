233 DISSECTION OF THE PALM OF THE HAND. Eeflect the skin from the palm. In doing so, you will observe how closely in the centre of the palm it adheres to the palmar fascia beneath it. On the ball of the little finger and the distal ends of the metacarpal bones, the subcutaneous structure is com- posed of a dense filamentous tissue, which contains numerous pellets of fat, forming a kind of elastic pad. A similar padding protects the palmar surfaces of the fingers. These cushions on the ends of the fingers defend them in the powerful actions of the hand; they are also useful in subservience to the nerves of touch. Be careful not to remove a small cutaneous muscle, jpalmaris brevis, situated near the ball of the little finger. The nerves of the pahn are supplied by the palmar branch of the median nerve (p. 231), which passes over the annular ligament; and by others, which rim up through miaute openings in the palmar fascia with the cutaneous arteries. Palmar This fascia has a silvery lustre, and, in the centre of fascia. the palm, is remarkably dense and strong. It is divided into three portions, a central,â€”by far the most conspicuous; an external, covering the muscles of the thumb; and an internal, covering the muscles of the little finger. From the deep surface of the fascia two septa dip down, so as to divide the palm into three separate compartments; one for the ball of the thumb, a second for that of the little finger, and a third for the centre of the palm. The fascia is formed by a prolongation from the anterior annular ligament. It is also strengthened by the expanded tendon of the palmaris longus. The central portion of the fascia is triangular, with the apex at the wrist. About the middle of the palm it splits into four portions, which are connected together by transverse tendinous fibres, ex- tending completely across the palm, and corresponding pretty nearly to the transverse furrow of the sldn in this situation!

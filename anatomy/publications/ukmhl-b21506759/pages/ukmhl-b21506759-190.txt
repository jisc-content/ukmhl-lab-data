176 DISSECTION OF THE NOSE. cartilages; 2. The general figure and arrangement of the nasal cavities ; 3. The membrane which lines them; and lastly, the dis- tribution of the olfactory nerves. Two pieces of fibro-cartilage on either side assist Caitilages of forming the framework of the external nose; and one in the centre completes the septum between the nasal fossse. j. i i • fv, The cartilage of the septum is placed perpendicularly m the middle line; it may lean a little, however, to one side or the other and in some rare instances it is perforated, so that the two nasal' cavities communicate with each other. Its outline is neariy trian-ular. TJie posterior border is received into a groove m the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid and the vomer; the anterior border is much thicker than the rest of the septum, and is con- nected, superiorly, with the nasal bones, and on either side with the lateral cartilages. ™ There are two lateral cartilages, an upper and a lowei. ine nwer is connected, superiorly, to the margin of the na.al and Slary bones, anteriorly to the cartilage of the septum, and Sferiorly to the lower cartilage by means of a tough fibrous mem- brane The ^o^eris sometimes called the cartilage of the pmna It • s c^ed upon itself in such a way as to form the boundary of the external opening of the nose. Superiorly, it is connected by fibrous LtmwTto the upper lateral cartilage; intei-nally it ™tac with its fellow of the opposite side, formmg the upper part ot the "nanasi; " posteri'orly, it is attached by fi^rou^ t^^^^^o the • ^c^lllnrv bone • in this tissue, at the base of the ala, are S^forrt-^^^^^^^ nodules of cartilage, called " cc^t^c^es rlla- We cannot but admire how well these c..dages are adapted to their office. By their elasticity they keep the ^olltontinuaUy open, and restore them to th.r ordinary size whenever they have been expanded by muscular action. The Uttle muscles moving the nasal cartilages have been de scribed with the dissection of the face (p. 56).

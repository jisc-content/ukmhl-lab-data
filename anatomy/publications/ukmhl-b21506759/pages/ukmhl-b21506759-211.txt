197 TflE DISSECTION OF THE ARM. The arm being placed at a right angle with the body, make three incisions through the skin ; the first, along the sternum ; the second, along the clavicle ; the third, along the front border of the axilla. The skin should be carefully separated from the subjacent layer of adipose tissue (called the superficial fascia). In doing so, unless the subject be very muscular you will scarcely notice the thin pale fibres .of the broad cutaneous muscle of the neck, (" platysma myoides " p. 1) which arises in this tissue. Cutaneous ^^^^rous nerves run through the subcutaneous tissue nerves. skm and the mammary gland. They are derived from various sources : some, branches of the superficial cervical plexus, descend over the clavicle : others, branches of the intercostal nerves, come through the intercostal spaces close to the sternum, with a small artery; a third series, also branches of the intercostal nerves, come out on the side of the chest, and run forwards over the outer border of the pectoralis major. The sttpra-clavicidar nerves which descend over the clavicle are subdivided, according to their direction, into sternal, clavicular and acromial branches (diagram, p. 3). The sternal cross the inner end of the clavicle, to supply the skin over the upper part of the sternum. The clavicular pass over the middle of the clavicle and supply the integument over the front of the chest and the maramary gland. The acromial branches cross over the outer end stoulder ' ''''''''''' ^^^-^^^^ of the Near the sternum you find the anterior cutaneous branches of the ^ntercostal nerves.

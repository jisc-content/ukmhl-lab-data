The action of the recti muscles is to bend the head forwards. LIGAMENTS OF THE SPINE. The vertebrae are connected by their intervertebral fibro-carti- lages, by ligaments in front of and behind their bodies, and by ligaments which extend between their arches and their spines. Their articular processes have capsular ligaments, and synovial membranes. This is a strong band of longitudinal fibres which co^o°n extends along the front of the bodies of the vertebra from Ugament. ^-^^ g^^-g sacrum. The fibres are not all of equal length. The more superficial extend from a given vertebra to the fifth or sixth below it; those a little deeper pass from a given vertebra to the second or third below it; while the deepest of all proceed from vertebra to vertebra. The ligament becomes broader and stronger in proportion to the size of the vertebrae. By making transverse incisions through it in different situations, we observe that its fibres are more firmly adherent to the intervertebral cartilages, and to the borders of the vertebras, than to the middle of the bones, j^^^^. These bands of ligamentous fibres fill up the intervals spinous between the spines of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae, ligaments, rj^^^^ j^^gj. j^arked in the lumbar region.

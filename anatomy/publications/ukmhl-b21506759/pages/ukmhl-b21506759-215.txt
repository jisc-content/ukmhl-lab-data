PECTORAL REGION. 201 anterior branches of the last four cervical nerves and the first dorsal (p. 206). Anterior These nerves come from the axillary plexus to supply thoracic the pectoral muscles. There are generally two, one for each pectoral muscle: and they enter the muscles with their respective arteries. If you were to trace these nerves to their source, you would find tbat they proceed from the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. However, the chief point of interest about them is, that they cross over the axillary artery in the first part of its course, where you might be called upon to tie it. Therefore, you would be careful not to include them in the ligature. Subelaviiis. ^^^^ muscle lies beneath the clavicle enclosed in a strong sheath, which you should open in order to expose it. It arises from the cartilage of the first rib by a round tendon, and is inserted into a groove on the under surface of the clavicle. Its nerve comes from the brachial plexus. Its action is to depress the clavicle, and prevent its too great elevation.

In addition to its great depth from the surface, varieties sometimes occur in the position of the nerves and veins, which would render the operation still more embarrassing. For instance, the anterior thoracic nerves may be moi-e numerous than usual, and form by their mutual communi- cations a kind of plexus round the artery. I have often seen a large nerve crossing obliquely over the artery immediately below the clavicle, to form one of the roots of the median nerve.

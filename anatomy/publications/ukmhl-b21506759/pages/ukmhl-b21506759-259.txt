MUSCLES OF THE BACK CONNECTED WITH THE AUM: 245 of considerable size, and take the place of one or more of the digital arteries, ordinarily derived from the superficial palmar arch. Other branches called ^perforating arteries, pass between the upper ends of the metacarpal bones to the back of the hand, and communicate with the carpal branches of the radial and ulnar arteries. Deep brancrh ^his nerve sinks into the palm with the ulnaris pro- of^tJieuhnar funda artery, between the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti. It then runs with the deep palmar arch towards the radial side of the palm, and terminates in the adductor pollicis. Between the pisiform and unciform bones, the nerve gives a branch to each of the muscles of the little finger. Subsequently, it sends branches to each interosseous muscle, and generally to the two internal lumbricales. The dissection of the remaining muscles of the palm, called, from their position, interossei, must be for the present postponed. DISSECTION OP THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK CONNECTED WITH THE AEM. Make an incision down the spine from the occiput to the sacrum â€¢ another from the last dorsal vertebra to the spine of the scapula' and thence along the spine to the acromion. Eeflect the skin from the dense subcutaneous tissue. Cutaneous These are derived from the posterior branches of the thTba^k. 'P^^^ Afte^ supplying the muscles in the ver- tebral groove, these branches become subcutaneous in nearly a regular series, but not all at an equal distance from the spme. Thus, in the cervical and upper dorsal region, the cuta- neous nerves perforate the trapezius close to the spine: in the lower dorsal and the lumbar region, they perforate the latissimus' dorsi m a hue nearly corresponding to the angles of the ribs Each cutaneous nerve then divides into internal and externai branches, wh:ch supply the integument of the respective regions R 3 "

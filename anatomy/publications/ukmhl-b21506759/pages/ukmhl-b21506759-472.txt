CALF OF THE LEG. 458 Deferring the course, relations, and branches of the popliteal artery till this vessel is exposed throughout its whole course, pass on now to the great muscles of the calf. Continue the incision down the centre of the calf to the heel, and reflect the skin. Cutaneous veins '^^^ chief cutaneous vein and nerve of the calf is and nerves of called the " external or posterior saphenousJ^ The the calf. vein commences on the outer side of the foot, runs behind the outer ankle, and then up the calf, receiving numerous tributary veins in its course. It eventually passes through the muscular fascia, and joins the popliteal vein. The corresponding nerve is formed by two roots*,â€”one from the peroneal, the other from the popliteal (fig. 101). The roots gene- rally unite about the middle of the calf, and the single nerve coming through the fascia, descends with the saphenous vein, and is finally distributed to the outer side of the foot and the little toe. The great flexor muscle of the foot consists of two Mtjscles of portions; the superficial one, called the " gastrocnemius," arises from the lower end of the femur; the deep one, called the " soleus," arises from the tibia and fibula. The force of both is concentrated on one thick tendon, called the " tendo Achillis," which is inserted into the heel. This muscle arises by two strong tendinous heads. Gastrocnemius. ^^^^ ^^^^^ ^^^-^ ^^^^^ condyle of the femur (fig. 101). The inner head is the larger. The two parts of the muscle descend, distinct from each other, and form the two bellies of the calf, of which the inner is rather the lower. Both terminate, rather below the middle of the leg, on the broad com- mencement of the tendo Achillis. The gastrocnemius should be divided transversely near to its insertion, and reflected upwards from the subjacent soleus, as high as its origin. By this proceeding you observe that the contiguous surfaces of the muscles are covered by a beautiful glistening tendon * These two roots are sometimes called, respectively, the communicans peronei and communicans poplitei.

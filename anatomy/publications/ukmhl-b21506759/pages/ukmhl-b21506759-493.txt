LIGAMENTS OF THE ANKLE. 479 the comparative shortness of the malleolus on this side (fig. 109). The great strength of it is proved by the fact, that in dislocations of the ankle inwards, the summit of the malleolus is more likely to be broken off than the ligament to be torn. It arises from a deep excavation at the apex of the malleolus, radiates from this point, and is inserted into the side of the astragalus, also into the os calcis, and the scaphoid bone. Besides this, some of Fig. 109. 1. Plantar fascia, 2. Calcaneo-scaplioid or elastic ligament which supports the head of the astragalus. 3. Internal lateral ligament, called from its shape deltoid. its fibres are inserted into, and become identified with, the calcaneo- scaphoid ligament, so as to brace it up internally (fig. 109). ^ ^ ^ This ligament consists of three distinct parts,â€”an an- lateral. terior, a posterior, and a middle (fig. 110). All three arise from an excavation near the summit of the external mal- leolus ; the first two are inserted into the front and the back of the astragalus ; the middle into the os calcis. The clo.siu-e of the joint is completed, in front and behind, by a thin capsular membrane attached to the bones near their articular surfaces, and sufficiently loose to permit the necessary range of motion.

115 DISSECTION OF THE HEART. the action of the valve. In the first place they are all attached to the ventricular surface of the valve. Secondly, the tendinous cords proceeding from a given papillary muscle are attached to the ad- ■ jacent halves of two of the larger flaps, and to a smaller inter- mediate one; consequently, when the ventricle contracts, and the papillary muscle also, the adjacent borders of the flaps will be ap- proxiinated. Thirdly, to insure the strength of every part of the valve, the tendinous cords are inserted at three different points of it in straight lines; accordingly, they are divisible into three sets. Those of the first are attached to the base of the valve; those of the second to the middle of it; those of the third to its loose border.* Pulmonaiy These are three membranous folds situated at the ori- or^semiluBar fice of the puhnonary artery. Their convex borders are attached to the fibrous ring at the root of the artery; their free edges present a festooned border, in the centre of which is a little cartilaginous body called the "nodulus," or "corpus ArantU:' The use of these little bodies is very obvious. Since the valves are semilunai-, when they fall together they would not exactly close the artery; there would be a space of a triangular form left between them in the centre, just as there is when we put the thumb, fore, and middle fingers together. This space is filled by the Httle bits of cartilage, so that the septum becomes complete. The valves are composed of a fold of the "endocardium," or hmng membrane of the heart. But since this would not of itself be sufficiently strong, we find between the folds a thin layer of fibrous J The best mode of she jii^g the action of the valve is to introduce a glass tube into the pulmonary artery, and then to pour water through it into the ventricle u^tU Z cavity IS quite distended.

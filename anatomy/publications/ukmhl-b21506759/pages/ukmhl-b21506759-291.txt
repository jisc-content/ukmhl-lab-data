277 WRIST-JOINT. Radio-car- ^^^^ J^^"^* formed by the lower end of the radius, PAi OB which articulates with the scaphoid and semilunar bones of the cai-pus: the lower end of the ulna is excluded from the joint by a triangular fibro-cartilage, which articulates with a small portion of the cuneiform bone. The joint is secured by an anterior, a posterior, and two lateral ligaments, forming, together, an uninterrupted capsule around it. The external lateral ligament extends from the styloid process of the radius, to the scaphoid bone (p. 278). The internal lateral ligament proceeds from the extremity of the styloid process of the ulna, to the cuneiform bone. Some of its fibres are attached to the pisiform bone. The anterior ligament consists of two or more broad bands of ligamentous fibres, which arise from the lower end of the radius, pass obliquely inwards, and are inserted into the fijrst row of carpal bones. The posterior ligament, weaker than the preceding, arises from the posterior surface of the lower end of the radius, descends ob- liquely inwards, and is inserted into the posterior surfaces of the first row of the carpal bones. The synovial membrane lines the triangular fibro-cartilage at the end of the ulna, is reflected over the several ligaments of the joint, and thence upon the first row of the carpal bones.

These corresponding surfaces are crusted with a thin layer of cartilage, and are provided with a very loose synovial membrane. The joint is strengthened in front and behind by a thin fibrous capsule, which extends from the an- terior and posterior borders of the sigmoid cavity of the radius, to the anterior and posterior surfiices of the styloid process of the nlna. But the prmcipal uniting medium between the bones is a strong fibro-cartilage. Fibro-cartilage between the radvus and ulna.~S^y, through T 3

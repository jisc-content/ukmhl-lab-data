LIGAMENTS OF THE HIP. 473 Interosseous ligament fibres ia fig. 104. What is the purpose of it ? Plainly, it acts as a strap to prevent the femur being extended beyond a certain limit: in other words, it pre- vents the body from rolling „. , ^ ,. , ° Ilio-luinbar ligament backwards at the hip. Lay open the capsule; ascertaining the enormous thickness of it in front, and the strong hold it has upon the bones. This proceeding exposes the cotyloid liga- ment, or " sucker" of the • acetabulum, and the liga mentum teres. The cotyloid li- Cotyloid . . ligament, gament IS a piece of fibro-cartilage which is attached all round the margin of the aceta- bulum. Its use is sufii- ciently apparent. It not only deepens the cavity, but gra- dually shelves off, so as to embrace the head of the femur like a sucker. It extends over the notch at the lower part of the acetabulum, and in this situation has received the name of the "transverse " ligament. Ligamen- ligamentum teres is exposed by drawing the head turn teres, ^f the femur out of the socket. This ligament is not round, as its name would imply, but somewhat flat and triangular. Its base is attached below, to the borders of the ace- tabular notch; its apex to the fossa in the head of the femur. To prevent pressure on it, and to allow free room for its play, there is a gap at the bottom of the acetabulum. This gap is not crusted with cartilage like the rest of the socket, but is occupied by a soft yielding fat. The ligamentum teres is surrounded by the synovial membrane. A Httle artery runs up with it to the head of the VEHTICAL SECTION THEOTJGH THE HIP.

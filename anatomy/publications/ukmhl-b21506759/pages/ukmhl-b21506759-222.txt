208 DISSECTION OF THE AXILLA. Branclies of '^^^^ number and origin of these branches often vary, the axiUary but their general course is in most cases similar; and artery. ^-^^^ usually arise in the order in which they are here described: â€” The thoradc axis arises above the pectoralis minor, and divides into branches which have been already noticed (p. 200). The inferior or long thoracic artery, sometimes called the external mammary, runs along the lower border of the pectoralis minor. It supplies the mammary gland, the serratus magnus and pectoral muscles, and maintains a free anastomosis with the short thoracic, internal mammary, and intercostal arteries. The sub-scapular is the largest branch of the axillary; it arises opposite the lower border of the subscapularis, and soon divides into an anterior and a posterior branch.

Thoracica humeraria. 9. Posterior circumflex. 6. Long thoracic. a. The anterior branch is the continued trunk; it runs along the ante^-ior edge of the subscapularis towards the lower angle of the scapula. Its numerous branches supply the subscapularis, latis- simus dorsi, and serratus magnus, and anastomose with the mter- costal and thoracic arteries, as well as the posterior scapular (a branch of the subclavian).

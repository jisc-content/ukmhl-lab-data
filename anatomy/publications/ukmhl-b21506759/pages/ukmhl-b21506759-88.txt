INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. 74 The branch to the external pterygoid comes apparently from the buccal nerve in its passage through this muscle. The branch to the internal pterygoid and tensor jpalati muscles is rather difficult to find. It proceeds from the inner side of the main trunk, descends between the internal pterygoid and the tensor palati, and supplies both. The 6 W branch passes either above or between the fibre of the external pterygoid to the buccinator, where xt ^F^ads out into filaments, which supply the skin, the mucous membrane and glands of the cheek, with common sensibility. The motor POwer of the buccinator, remexnber, is derived from the facia nerve Tbs is proved not only by careful dissection, but by the fact that the

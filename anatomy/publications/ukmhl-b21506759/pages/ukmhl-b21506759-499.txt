SINUSES OF THE DUKA MATER. 485 I I 3 Fig. 113. by a splitting of the dura mater into two layers as shown in fig. 113, where 1, represents a vertical section through the superior longitudinal sinus. They are lined by the same smooth membrane as the rest of the venous system. Since their walls consist of such unyielding structure, and are always on the stretch, it is obvious that they are ad- mirably adapted to resist the pressure of the brain. There ai-e fifteen of these si- nuses; five are pairs, and five are single, as follow:— The five pairs of sinuses are, — The lateral. The superior petrosal. The inferior petrosal. The cayernous. The occipital. The five single sinuses are,— The superior longitudinal. The inferior longitudinal. The circular. The transverse. The straight. All of these eventually discharge their blood into the internal jugular veins. Superior This runs along the longitudinal sinus. (fig. 114). It begins gradually increases in and opposite the tubercle of the right and left lateral sinuses, the right being in general the larger. Besides numerous veins from the cancellous texture of the skull-cap, the superior longitudinal sinus re- ceives large veins from each hemi- sphere of the cerebrum. It is interesting to observe that these veins run from behind forwards, contrary to the current of blood in the sinus, and that they pass through the wall of the sinus very obliquely, like the ureter into the bladder. The probable object of upper edge of the falx cerebri very small at the crista galli, size in its course backwards, occipital bone divides into the Fig. 114. 1. Superior longitudinal sinus. 2.

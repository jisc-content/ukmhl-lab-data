It is inserted into the inner side of the angle of the jaw. Notice particularly the direction of the fibres of the pterygoid muscles, else you cannot imderstand their action upon the jaw. The fibres of the external pterygoid nm horizontally outwards and backwards from then- origin; the fibres of the internal pter5'goid run downwards and backwards from their origin. In structure, these muscles are similar to the masseter ; that is, they are inter-

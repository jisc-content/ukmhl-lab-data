PLAN OF THE SACHAl PLEXUS AND BRANCHES. panied by a branch of the ischiatic artery, called the " comes nervi ischiaticV * I have known serious secondary hemorrhage from this branch after an amputation. * The arteria comes nervi iscliiatici runs generally by the side of the nerve, but sometimes in the centre of it. This artery becomes one of the chief channels by which the blood reaches the lower Hmb after ligatm-e of the femoral. See a preparation in the Museum of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where the femoral was tied by John Hunter fifty years before the man's death. G G 2

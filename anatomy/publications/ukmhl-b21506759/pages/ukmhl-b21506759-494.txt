480 LIGAMENTS OF THE ANKLE. Fig. 110. Besides flexion and extension, the construction of the ankle-joint admits of a very slight lateral movement: but this is only per- mitted in the extended state of the joint. This is useful to us in the direction of our steps. In adaptation to this move- ment the internal malleolus is made much shorter than the outer; it is not so tightly confined by its ligaments, and its articular surface is part of a cylinder. Open the joint to see that the breadth of the articular surfaces of the bones is greater in front than behind. The ob- ject of this is to render the tibia less liable to be dislocated forwards over the astragalus. Whenever this happens, the astragalus must of necessity become firmly locked between the malleoli. The astragalus is the key- co" a Btone of the arch of the foot, THE BONES ^ud supports thewholeweight oFTHEPooT. ^^^^^ articulates with the OS calcis and the os scaphoides in such a manner as to permit the ab- duction and adduction of the foot, so useful in the direction of our steps. The astragalus articulates with the os calcis by two distinct surfaces, respecting which it is necessary to remark, that the anterior is slightly convex, and the posterior slightly concave. This adaptation of itself contributes much to prevent the sepa- ration of the bones. But their principal bond of union Interosseous . strons interosseous ligament which occupies ligament.

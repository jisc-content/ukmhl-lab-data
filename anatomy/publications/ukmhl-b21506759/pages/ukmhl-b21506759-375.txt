Such is their usual order: but these branches, though constant as to their general distribution, vary as to their origin a. The ^l^o~lumbar is analogous to the lumbar branches^'of'the aorta. It ascends outwards beneath the psoas, sends branches to this muscle and he quadratus lumborum, and then, running near the crest of the ihum, supplies the iliacus muscle, and finafly ia- osculates with the circumflexa iUi (p. 330). ^

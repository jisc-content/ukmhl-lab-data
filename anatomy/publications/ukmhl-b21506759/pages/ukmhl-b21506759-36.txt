SUBMAXILLARY REGION. 22 The stylo-hyoideus arises from the styloid process devis°"^^°^" temporal bone, and is inserted into the body of the os-hyoides. This muscle runs close along the posterior belly of the digas- tricus. Most frequently the digastric tendon runs through the substance of it. Its. nerve comes from the facial.'^ Its action is to raise and draw back the os-hyoides. The objects which we have to examine in the digastric tiiangle are twelve in number, as follow: — 1. Submaxillary gland. 7. Stylo-maxillary ligament. 2. Facial vein. 8. Part of tlie parotid gland. 3. Facial artery. 9. Part of the external carotid artery. 4. Submental artery. 10. Mylo-hyoideus muscle. 6. Mylo-hyoidean nerve. 11. Hypoglossal nerve. 6. Submaxillary absorbent glands. 12. Part of the hyo-glossus muscle. In the ordinary position of the head, the sub- Submaxillary maxillary gland is partially concealed by the jaw, gkmd^ when the head falls back the gland is more ex- posed. It is about the size of a chestnut, and is divided into several lobes. Its upper margin is covered by the body of the jaw; its lower margin overlaps the side of the os- hyoides. Its cutaneous surface is flat, biit the lobes on its deep surface are irregular, and often continuous with those of the sub- lingual gland. By raising the gland we find that it lies upon the mylo-hyoideus, the hyo-glossus, the tendon of the digastricus, and a portion of the hjipoglossal nerve, seen above the tendon. Mark these relations well, because they are of importance, as we shall presently explain, in tying the lingual artery. The duct of the gland (Wharton's duct*-) passes from its under surface, runs forward under the mylo-hyoideus, and opens into the floor of the mouth, by the side of the frenum it is about two inches; its dimensions are not equal throughout, for it is dilated about the middle, and contracted at the orifice. * Thom.

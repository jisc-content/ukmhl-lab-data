471 LIGAMENTS 0Â¥ THE PELVIS. H H 4 The innomincate bones are connected to each other in front, constituting the " pubic symphysis ; " posteriorly to the sacrum or the spine, constituting the " sacro-iliac symphysis." This is secured by 1, an anterior ligament, consisting physis^"^'"^' oblique and transverse fibres; 2, a posterior ligament, less distinct; 3, a sub-pubic ligament, or " ligamentum arcuatum:" it is remarkably strong, and rounds off the point of the pubic arch ; 4, an intermediate fibro-cartilage. If you make a perpendicular section through it, you observe that it consists of con- centric layers, and that its general structure resembles that between the bodies of the vertebrae. It acts like a buffer, and breaks the force of shocks passing through the pelvic arch. Fig. 104. Great sacro-Ischlatic ligament Lesser sacrO 'Isctiiatic ligament Accessory ligament of the hip joint. Sacro- '^^^^ secured by, 1, ligamentous fibres in front; 2, iliac sym- ligamentous fibres much more marked, and collected physis- bundles behind; 3, a very strong ligament called the ilio-lumbar, which extends from the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra to the crest of the ilium, fig, 105; 4, the

248 IHUSULES pP THK BACK CONNECTED WITH THE ARM.- natural projection of the lower angle of the bone, and tlie impaired, movements of the arm.* Between the base of the scapula, the trapezius, and the upper border of the latissimus dorsi, a triangular space is observed when the arm is raised, in which the lower fibres of the rhomboideus. major and part of the sixth intercostal space, are exposed. Imme- diately above the crest of the ilium, between the free margins of the latissimus dorsi and external oblique, there is, also, an interval in which a little of the internal oblique can be seen. This is a dense shining aponeurosis in the lumbar Pascialum- region, thin and poiated above, broader and stronger below. It consists of tendinous fibres, which are at- tached to the spines of the six or seven lower dorsal, all the lumbar and sacral vertebte, and to the posterior part of the crest of the ilium. It serves as the common origin of the latissimus dorsi, the serratus posticus inferior, and the internal oblique and transverse muscles of the abdomen, and it forms the posterior part of the sheath of the erector spinas. When suppuration takes place in the loins, constituting " lumbar abscess," in connection with spmal disease, the matter is seated beneath this fascia, and is therefore a long time in coming to the surface. Eeflect the trapezius from its insertion. On its under surface you will see the ramifications of its nutrient artery, the supei'ficiahs com (a branch of the posterior scapular). A large nerve, the apinal accessory, enters its under surface near the clavicle, and then divides into filaments, some of which ascend, others descend in its substance. _ This nerve is one of the three divisions of the eighth Spmal aaces- p^ir of cerebral nerves. It arises from the lateral part .orynerye, ^^^^^^^ p^^^..^^ ^£ gpi^al cord by several roots, fiome of which are as low as the fom-th cervical vertebra. ■* I ha^e seen an ^stance of tWs displacement. There was great Fojection pf the inferior angle of i^e scapula, especially when the man attempted to raise the arm He could not raise the arm beyond a right angle, imless firm pressure was -ado on t^^^^ Ztv upgle of the .cap.da, 'so as to supply the place of the muscular strap, mether the scapula can be replaced or not, apply a firm bandage round the chest.

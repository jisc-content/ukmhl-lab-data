PARTS CONCERNED IN INGUINAL HERNIA. 299 tion. The second branch is the " cremasteric.^^ It supplies the coverings of the cord, and chiefly the cremaster muscle. After giving ofif other unnamed muscular branches, the main trunk ter- minates in the rectus by minute inosculations with the internal mammary. Such is a brief outline of the anatomy of the parts concerned in inguinal hernia. This description applies equally to the female, provided the round ligament be substituted for the spermatic cord. Of course the inguinal canal is proportionably smaller, and there is no cremaster. Nomenclature ^^^n a piece of intestine escapes along the inguinal of the several Canal with the cord, and protrudes through the outer S^Â°Wiiia. ^^^^^^ oblique inguinal hernia. If the intestine stops in the inguinal canal, it is called an mier)iaZ or incomplete inguinal hernia; such an one is generally of small size, and often difficult of detection. Lastly, if a portion of intestine escape at once through the external ring, then it is called a direct inguinal hernia. Coverings of An oblique inguinal hernia has all the coverings of feri^?""''* B^^eath the skin, therefore, and the sub- cutaneous tissue, there will be 1. The spermatic fascia, derived from the aponeurosis of the external oblique. 2. The cremaster muscle, derived from the internal oblique and transversalis. 3. The infundibuliform fascia, derived from the fascia trans- versalis. The incomplete inguinal hernia will be covered by 1. The aponeurosis of the external oblique, 2. The cremaster. 3. The infundibuliform fascia. The direct inguinal hernia will be covered by 1. The spermatic fascia. 2. The fascia transversalis.* * What becomes, it may be asked, of the fibres of the conjoined tendon of tlie in emal obhque and transversaUs ? They are either protruded before the per t neun or permit the hernia to slip between them, peritoneum,

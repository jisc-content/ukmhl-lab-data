INTEROSSEOUS MUSCLES. 268 Each dorsal interosseous muscle arises from the opposite Dorsal in- g-^jgg of two metacarpal boues (fiff. 48). From this double ttiX*0SS60\lS \ o ' origin the fibres converge to a tendon, which passes between the metacarpal joints of the lingers, and is inserted into the side of the first phalanx: it is also connected by a broad expansion with the extensor tendon on. the back of the finger. The first dorsal interosseous muscle (abductor indicis) is larger than the others, and occupies the interval between the thumb and fore-finger. It arises from the upper half of the ulnar side of the DIAGEAM OF THE FOUB DOBSAl IN- DIAGEAM OF THE FOUB PAXMAK IX- TEROSSEI, DEAWIKG FROM THE TEHOSSEI, DBAWG TOWABDS THE MEDDLE LINE.

Its fibres converge on either side to a tendon, which is inserted into the radial side of the first phalanx of the index finger and its extensor tendon. The second dorsal interosseous muscle occupies the second meta- carpal space.. It is inserted into the radial side of the first phalanx of the middle finger and its extensor tendon.

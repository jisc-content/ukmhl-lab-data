186 MUSCLES OF THE BACK. The action of these oblique muscles is not only to assist in maintaining the trunk erect, but to bend the spine to one or the other side. These little muscles arise from the apices of the Levatores transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae, and are costarum. ^^^^^^^^^ -^^^ ^j^^ j.-^ helovf. The direction of their fibres corresponds with that of the outer layer of the intercostal muscles. They are muscles of inspiration. These muscles extend between the spines of the ver- Interspi- tebrse. They only exist in those parts of the vertebral column which are the most moveable, namely the cervical and lumbar regions. In the cervical region they are arranged in pairs. In the'lumbar region they are single. These muscles extend between the transverse pro- Intertrans- ^^^^08 in the cervical and lumbar regions.

We have next to examine the muscles concerned in the move- ments of the head upon the first and second vertebrae. The com- plexus must be previously reflected. This is a largely developed interspinal muscle.

This is also an interspinal muscle, but smaller than ^tfposticus the preceding. Arising from the feebly developed minor. -^^ the first vertebra, it expands as it ascends, and is inserted into the occipital bone between the inferior curved ridge and the foramen magnum. The action of the two precedmg muscles is to raise the head. little flat muscles, called by Theile (Miiller's Archives f.

These muscles form but a part of the multifidus spinte.

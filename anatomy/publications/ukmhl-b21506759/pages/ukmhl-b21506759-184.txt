170 SPHENO-PALATINE GANGLION. e. Anterior dental branch.—This arises just before the nerve emerges from the infra-orbital foramen. It descends in a special canal in the anterior wall of the upper jaw, and gives filaments to the fangs of the first molar, canine, and incisor teeth. It also supplies the gums and the mucous lining of the antrum. /. The terminal branch, namely the mfra-orhital, was dissected with the face (p. 64). At this stage of the dissection make a vertical incision rather on one side of the middle line of the skull, to expose the cavity of the nose. We shall thus be able to dissect the «spheno-palatme ganglion " and its branches. This little body (fig. 37) called, after its discoverer, Se gl" « MeckeUs ganglion," is situated in the spheno-maxil- lary fossa, close to the outer side of the spheno-palatme foramen, immediately below the superior maxillary nerve. Its sensitifve roots proceed from the superiormaxillary its motor from the vidian branch of the facial; and its sympathetic from the carotid plexus. Thus supplied, it furnishes branches to mucous membrane and glands of the hard and soft palate and to the back part of the nose.* * Meckel's gangUon gives off the foUowing branches: — a BrLjJto tkepalate.-To see these the mucous memhrane must be removed Jmfheback part of the nose; we shall then be able to;--;^-™,*^;te r tl!p Wr,alate nearly to the gams of the incisor teeth; but one or two branches along the hard palate ^^e^^^y ™ | ^^^^ ,^tine descends either in proceed backwards o s^ly t^^^ V f^^' ^^^^^ ^ .^^ ,,^,,es the same ''-^Ij^^^^^^/X^^^^ gWs of the soft palate.

318 BRANCHES OF ABDOMINAL AORTA. This large artery descends beneath the pancreas and mesenteric over the transverse .part of the duodenum (p. 315), and artery and then runs between the layers of the mesentery towards ^ ' the right iliac fossa, where it terminates in branches for the supply of the caecum. Thus its course describes a gentle curve from left to right. The left or convex side of the curve gives off a series of branches (from ten to sixteen) to the small intestines; while the concave side furnishes the right colic and the middle colic arteries for the supply of the large intestines (fig. 64). Fig. 64. 1. Superior mesenteric a. 2. Colica media. 3. Colica dextra. 4. Ileo-colica. 5. Inferior mesenteric a. 6. Colica sinistra. 7. Arteria sigmoidea. 8. Superior hemorrhoidal a. PLAN OF THE MESENTEHIC AHTEEIES, ANB THEIR COMMXTNICATION. Now we should trace the branches to the small intestines,,in order to see the beautiful series of arches which they form by their mutual inosculations. There are three or fom- tiers of them, each tier smaller than the preceding. The ultimate branches ramify in circles round the intestine. This circular arrangement of the vessels in the coats of the bowel is practically interesting, because it enables one in almost all cases to distinguish the intestine from the hernial sac.

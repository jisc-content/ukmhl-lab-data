PERITONEUM. 308 either to each other or to the back of the abdomen. This donei we will endeavour to trace the peritoneum as a continuous membrane. This is the fold which connects the small intestines to Mesenteiy. ^^^^ abdomen. To see it you should raise the omentum and the transverse arch of the colon. You then observe that its attached part or root extends from the left side of the second lumbar vertebra across the spine to the right iliac fossa. The loose part of the mesentery curves, as it were, like a ruffle, and encloses the small intestine from the beginning of the jejunum to the end of the ileum. Between its layers, are the mesenteric vessels, nerves, glands and lymphatics. This broad fold connects the transverse colon to Transverse ^-^^ ^^^-^ ^^ye abdomen. It forms a sort of parti- tion, dividing the abdomen into an upper compart- ment, containing the stomach, liver, and spleen; and a lower, containing the convolutions of the smaU intestines. As regards the caecum, the ascending and descending portions of the colon, they, as a general rule, are bound down by the peritoneum in their respective situations. It covers only two-thirds, or thereabouts, of their anterior surface; the rest is connected by loose cellular tissue to the back of the abdomen.* This broad peritoneal fold proceeds from the lower Great ^^^^^j. ^he stomach, like a curtain over the convolu- omentum. ^.^^^ ^^^^^ intestines. From this resemblance its name is probably derived. In corpulent persons it is enor- mously loaded with fat, and contributes very much to the size ot the belly. In thin subjects, on the other hand, it is often quite transparent. Its length, too, varies considerably.

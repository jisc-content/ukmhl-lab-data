Cut open the superior longitudinal sinus: observe that it is triangular, and that its cavity is intersected in many places by slender fibrous cords, termed " chordce Willisii."* Their precise use is not understood. In the neighbourhood of the superior longitudinal piccS s^^^^ ^® ^^^^ "^^^^ ^^^^^ granulations, sometimes lying singly, sometimes in clusters. They are termed " glan- dulce Pacchioni,'''\ and are found in three distinct situations: — 1, on the outside of the dura mater, often so large as to occasion depressions in the bones; 2, on the surface of the pia mater; 3, in thfe interior of the longitudinal sinus, covered by its lining membrane. Their size, number, and appearance differ in different subjects. Nothing is determined concerning their precise nature ; but it is presumed that they are morbid products, since they are never observed in very young subjects. These are the two great sinuses through which all the Lateral ^^^^^ ^^^^ t^^^]^ ig returned into the internal jugular sinuses. ^^^.^ course is well marked in the dry skull. The right is commonly the larger. Each proceeds at first horizon- tally outwards, inclosed between the layers of the tentorium, along a gToove in the occipital bone and the inferior angle of the parietal; it then descends along the mastoid portion of the tem- poral bone, and again indenting the occipital, turns forwards to the foramen lacerum posterius, and terminates in the internal jugular ^^^^•^ This is of small size. It terminates in the straight Sdind sS.' sinus at the anterior margin of the tentorium (fig. lU). * So eaUed after our countiTman Willis, who first described them in his work De Cerebri Anatome, 1664. ., i - n^ns Tiioco hndiVi t Aft,er the ItaUan anatomist, who first described them m 170o.

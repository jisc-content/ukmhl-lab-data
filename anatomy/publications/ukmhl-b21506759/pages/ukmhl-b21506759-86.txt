INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. 72 jaw to the under surface of the masseter, with the masseteric nerve. The anterior and posterior temporal arteries ascend to supply the temporal muscle, ramifying close to the bone, one near the , front, the other near the posterior border of the muscle. The jpterygoicl branches supply the internal and external ptery- goid muscles. The buccal branch runs forwards with the buccal nerve to the buccinator. The superior-dental branch runs along the back part of the sviperior maxillary bone, and sends small arteries through the foramina in the bone to supply the pulps of the molar and bicuspid teeth. It also supplies the gums. The infra-orbital branch passes through the spheno-maxillai-y fissure, then runs forwards along the infra-orbital canal with the superior maxillary nerve, and emerges upon the face at the infra- orbital foramen. While in the infra-orbital canal the artery sends branches downwards through little canals in the bone to supply the incisor and canine teeth. The descending palatine, a branch of considerable size, runs down the posterior palatine canal with the palatine nerve, and then along the hard palate, in which it is lost. It suppHes the gums, the glands, and mucous membrane of this part, and furnishes branches to the soft palate. The Vidian, an insignificant branch, rvms backwards through the Vidian canal with the Vidian nerve, and is lost upon the Eus- tachian tube. The nasal branch enters the nose' through the spheno-palatme foramen in company with the nasal nerve from Meckel's (spheno- palatine) ganglion, and ramifies upon the spongy bones and the septum narium. The pterygo-palatine is a small but constant branch which runs backwards through the pterygo-palatine canal, and ramifies upon the upper part of the pharynx and the Eustachian tube. The internal-rtxaxillary vein is formed by the veins con-espond- ing to the branches of the artery. It joins .the temporal vem in the substance of the parotid gland.

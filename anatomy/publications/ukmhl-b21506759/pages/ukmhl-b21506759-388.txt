The mucous membrane of the urethra is laid upon a substratum of areolar tissue. Then comes a very thin layer of elastic fibrous tissue, of which the fibres are arranged both in a longitudinal and a transverse direction—giving the parts that springiness of which we are sensible in introducing the catheter. Outside this is a layer of muscular fibre. It has been demonstrated beyond aU dispute that the urethra is surrounded throughout its whole course by muscular fibre of the involuntary kind. Therefore, the whole of the canal having a muscular coat, similar to an intestme, any part of it is liable to a spasmodic contraction. The urethra is lined by spheroidal epithelium, and near tbe glans is provided with papillae: this, therefore, is the most sensi- ^'^ll^tlj, the urethra is provided with a closely-set network of absorbent vessels,-a fact which has been demonstrated by the beautiful quicksilver injections of Panizza * They run fxom behind, forwards, and join the absorbents of the glans penis.

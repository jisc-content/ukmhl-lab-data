In the bilateral operation the incision is semilunar, the horns being made on either side be- tween the tuber ischii and the anus, equidistant from these pomts respectively; while the centre of the incision runs about three- quarters of an inch above the anus. At the anus the skin becomes finer and more delicate, Anal glands, ^^^.^-^g ^ gradual transition towards mucous mem- brane ; and during life it is drawn into wrinkles by the permanent contraction of the cutaneous sphincter. Moreover, the skm at the margin of the anus is richly provided with minute glands , which secrete an unctuous substance to facilitate the passage of the fa3ces. When this secretion becomes defective or vitiated, the anal cuta- neous folds are apt to become excoriated, chapped, or fissured; and then defoecation becomes exceedingly painful. It matters little how we reflect the skin. A conve- Subcuta- i^ient way is to make an incision down the raphe, around the anus, to the coccyx. Two others may then be made . on each side at right angles to the first, the one at the upper, the other at the lower end of it. Thus the skm of the permeum xnay be turned back Hke folding doors.

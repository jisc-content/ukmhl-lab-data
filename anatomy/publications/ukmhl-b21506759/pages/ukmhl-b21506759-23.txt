The nervus accessorius supplies the sterno-mastoid, and, after leaving the muscle, is joined by a branch from the second or third cervical nerve. To find the nervug accessorius before it enters the sterno-mastoid, dissect deep near the angle of the jaw, and you will see it emerg- ing beneath the posterior belly of the digastricus, close to the transverse process of the atlas (fig. 2). The upper mastoid artery, a branch of the occipital, runs into the muscle with the nerve.

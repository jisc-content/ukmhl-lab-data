The descending, one or more in number, of considerable size, run down between the rectus and crurfBus, supply both these muscles, and may be traced as low as the knee, where they inosculate with the ai'ticular arteries. The jperforating branches of the profunda are so named because they pass through the adductors to supply the hamstring muscles. There are generally three, but they vary both in number and size. The first is the largest. It passes between the' pectineus and ad- ductor brevis, and then through the tendon of the adductor magnus.

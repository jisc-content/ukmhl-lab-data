401 SPLEEN. that the long axis is neai-Iy vertical. The outer side, adapted to the diaphragm and ribs, is convex, while the inner side, adapted to the great end of the stomach, is concave. The blood-vessels enter the concave side by several ramifications, corresponding to the primordial lobes of the organ. Besides its peritoneal coat, the spleen has a fibrous capsule, which is elastic, to accommodate itself to the varying size of the organ. This capsule not only covers the outside of it, but sends into the interior numerous threads, which cross each other in various direc- tions, and form a network, dividing the spleen into so many cham- bers. Moreover, it is interesting to observe that at the points where the bands cross they are secured by a small white knot. Besides constituting the general framework of the organ, the cap- sule provides the vessels with sheaths which support them through- out their ramifications in the interior. The splenic chambers are filled by what is called the "pulp" of the spleen. _ This is a soft reddish-brown substance, easily scraped off with a kmfe. Examined under the microscope, it consists entirely of gland cells of a pale yellow coloiu-, and smaller than the corpuscles of the blood. Here and there, however, in the pulp are found other larger cells, of a white colour and perfectly spherical form. Attention was first directed to them by Malpighi, and they have therefore been called after him the "Malpighian bodies." They are not free like the smaller cells, but attached, each by a slender pedicle to one of the threads. The pedicle contains a small artery, which ramifies over the surface of the cell, and then terminates in a brush of capillaries which spread out in the pulp The xn erior o the cell is filled with a clear fluid and a multitude eleZnH" ' ' " " " '^'"^ '''' ^^^^-g How are the blood-vessels distributed ?

85 DISSECTION or THE CHEST. inosculates ^vith the epigastric (a branch of the external iliac). Its branches are as follow : — a. ArteHa comes nervi jphrenici. —A very slender artery which accompanies the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm. h. Mediastinal and thymic.—These branches supply the cellular tissue of the anterior mediastinum, the pericardium, and the trian- gularis sterni muscle. The thymic are only visible in childhood, and disappear with the thymus gland. c. Intercostal. — One at least,, and often two, for each inter- costal space. They inosculate with the intercostal arteries from the aorta. d. Perforating arteries, which pass through the intercostal spaces, and supply the pectoral muscle and skin of the chest. In the female they are of large size, for the supply of the mammary gland. e. The intercosto-phrenic branch runs outwards behind the cartilages of the false ribs, and terminates near the last intercostal space. It supplies small arteries to the diaphragm, to the sixth, seventh, and sometimes the eighth intercostal spaces. There are several absorbent glands in the neighbourhood of the internal mammary artery. They receive the absorbents from the mner portion of the mammary gland, from the diaphragm, and the wall of the abdomen. In disease of the inner portion of the mamma, these glands may enlarge, Avithout any enlargement of those in the axilla. Mediastina. " mediastina" are the spaces which the two ■ pleural sacs leave between them in the antero-posterior plane of the chest. There is an anterior, and a posterior medi- astmum. To put these spaces in the simplest light, let us ima- gine the heart and lungs to be removed from the chest and the two pleural sacs to be left in it by themselves. The two sacs. If inflated, would then appear like two bladders, in contact only m the middle, as shown by the dotted outlines in the an- nexed scheme (fig. 13). The interval marked a, behind the sternum, would represent the anterior mediastinum: the intelu! es 3 '

Beneath the hyo- glossus muscle lie the lingual artery, part of the middle constrictor of the pharynx, and part of the genio-hyo-glossus. The genio-hyo-glossus arises by a tendon from the G-enio-liyo- ^^^^g^cle behind the symphysis of the jaw, and is inserted into the os-hyoides and the tongue from base to tip. This is the largest and most important of the muscles of the tongue. It is fan-shaped, with the apex attached to the s}Tnphysis. From thence its fibres radiate into the entire length of the tongue. It derives, its nerves from the hypoglossal and its blood from the lingual artery. Its action is various. The posterior fibres, by raising the os-hyoides and drawing forwards the base of the tongue, protrude the tongue out of the mouth ; the anterior fibres draw the

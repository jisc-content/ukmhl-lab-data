LATERAL VENTRICLES. 503 K K 4 called its auterior crura, — one on either side the mesial line. They do not extend so far forwards as the corpus callosum, but turn downwards to the base of the brain, where they may be traced, one into each of the corpora mammillaria (fig. 120). Immediately behind and below the anterior crura there is a passage through which the choroid plexuses of opposite sides are con- Momo.^^ °^ tinuous with each other. This aperture is called the "■foramen of Mom^o." * Strictly speaking, it is not a foramen, but only a communication existing between the two lateral and the third ventricles. Look at the posterior part of the fornix, and observe that from each angle of the base is continued a thin white band, which runs along, and is intimately connected ^vith, the concave side of the hippocampus major: to this band the name of "tcenia hippocampi" is applied; it is sometimes called the posterior crus of the fornix.| * Monro, " Microscopic Enquiries into the Nerves and Brain."

It requires a very lean subject, and great anatomical dexterity to trace them. „ ,. . The coiliac axis arises from the front of the aorta, Caeliac axis and its between the pillars of the diaphragm, just above the branches. ^-^t^qj. border of the pancreas. It is a very thick trunk which, after a com-se of about half an inch, divides into three branches, — the coronaria ventriculi, the splenic, and the hepatic. PLAN OF THE BRANCHES OF THE C^aSLIAC AXIS.

I omental. The coronaria ventriculi, the smallest of the three, ascends a little to the left towards the oesophageal end of the stomach, and then curves along the upper border of the stomach towards the pylorus, where it inosculates with the pyloric branch of the hepatic artery. It gives branches to the oesophagus as well as to the stomach. The hepatic artery ascends between the layers of the lesser omentum to the transverse fissure of the liver, where it divides into branches for its several lobes. In its course to the Uver, it lies to the left of the bile duct, and in front of the portal vein: all three are contained in the right border of the lesser omentum. The hepatic gives off — a. The pyloric, which runs along the upper curve of the stomach and inosculates with the coronaria ventriculi. 6. The gastro-epiploica dextra, which runs behind the duo- denum, then along the gi-eat curve of the stomach, and inos- culates directly with the gastro-epiploica sinistra, a branch of the splenic. It gives off — 1. Branches to the pancreas aaid duodenum

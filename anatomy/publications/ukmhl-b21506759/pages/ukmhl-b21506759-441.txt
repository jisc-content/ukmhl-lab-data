427 Scarpa's triangle. The most important practical point about the muscle is, that it overlaps the femoral artery in the middle of the thigh; and the inner border of the muscle is the guide to the vessel in the situa- tion where it is usually tied for a pophteal aneurism. Fig. 96. DIAGEAM OF SCAEPA's TEIANGLE. What is the exact spot at which the sartorius reaches the femoral artery ? I have examined many bodies in reference to this point and find that there is no certainty about it. The distance from the crural arch at which the artery and the muscle meet, varies from one and a half to four and a half inches. The best way to find the inner border of the sartorius during life is to make the patient put the muscle into action. Gracilis Passing in the next place to the adductors on the inner side of the thigh, we should examine another long flat muscle, called the gracilis. To dissect it properly, it should be

MUSCLES OP THE BACK. 187 This at-ises from the spine of the second vertebra, and inferior inserted into the transverse process of the first. Its action is to rotate the first upon the second vertebra; in other words to turn the head round. Obli T "^^^^ muscle arises from the transverse process of the superior ^^^^ vertebra, and is inserted in the interval between the curved ridges of the occiput. Its action is to draw the occiput towards the spine. Observe that the obliqui and recti muscles of one side form the sides of a triangle, in which we find the branches of the suboccipital nerve, the vertebral artery, and the arch of the atlas. Eectus ca i "^^^^ ^^^^^ muscle extends between the transverse tis lateralis. Process of the first vertebra and the eminentia jugu- laris of the occiput; but since this eminence is the transverse process of the occipital vertebra, the muscle must be considered as an intertransverse one. Nerves of Posterior branches of the spinal nerves supply the the back, muscles and skin of the back. They pass backwards between the transverse processes of the vertebra?, and divide into external and internal branches. The general plan upon which these nerves are arranged is the same throughout the whole length of the spine; but since there are certain peculiarities deservmg of notice in particular situations, we must examine each region separately. Cervical '^^^ posterior division of the first cervical nerve (the region. Suboccipital) passes between the arch of the atlas and the vertebral artery, and divides into branches which supply the recti and obliqui muscles concerned in the movement of the head upon the first two vertebrae. The posterior branch (the great occipital) of the second cervical nerve is the largest of the series. It turns upwards beneath the inferior oblique muscle, passes through the complexus, and runs with the occipital artery to the back of the scalp _ The posterior divisions of the six lower cervical nerves divide into external and znternal branches. The exte^^cU are small and terminate m the splenius, and the continuation of tl ^ rector

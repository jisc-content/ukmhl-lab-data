SYMPATHETIC IN THE CHEST. 105 b. Cardiac branches.—These are very smaU, and join the cardiac plexus. c. Pulmonary branches.— These accompany the bronchial tubes. The greater number are seen behind the root of the lung, forming the posterior pulmonary plexus. A few, forming the anterior pulmonary plexus, proceed over the front of the lung's root. Both these plexuses are joined by filaments from the sympathetic system. But the nerves of the lungs are very smaU, and cannot be traced far into their substance.* d. (Esophageal plexus.—We have already mentioned that below the root of the lung each pneumogastric nerve is subdivided so as to form an interlacement of nerves round the oesophagus (plexus ~ guise). From this plexus numerous filaments supply the coats of the tube; but the majority of them are collected into two or more nerves, which pass with the oesophagus through the diaphragm for the supply of the stomach. Having examined the contents of the posterior mediastinum from the right side, now do so from the left. Turn the left liing out of its cavity and fasten it towards the right side. After re- moving the pleura, we see the descending thoracic aorta, the pneumogastric nerve crossing the arch and sending the recurrent branch through it; also the first part of the course of the left sub- clavian covered externaUy by pleura. Trace the pneumogastric nerve behind the left bronchus to the CBsophagus, and dissect the oesophageal plexus on this side. Lastly, notice the lesser vena azygos which crosses under the aorta about the sixth or seventh dorsal vertebra, and joins the vena azygos major.

Its branches are five in number, and generally arise in the following order : â€” The first lumbar nerve is, both in course and distribution, analogous to an intercostal nerve, and may, therefore, be appro- priately called the lumbar intercostal* It crosses obliquely over the quadratus lumborum to the crest of the ilium, and then.

Like the other inter- costals, it gives off a lateral cutaneous branch ; this is larger than the others, and runs over the crest of the ilium to supply the skin of the buttock. * It often happens tliat the first lumbar nerve divides into two branches: of these, the upper is generaUy termed the ilio-hypogastric ; the lower, the ilio-inguinaL But both run nearly a similar course, and have a similar distxibution.

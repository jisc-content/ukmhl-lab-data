INTERCOSTAL VESSELS. 107 But neither of these layers extend all the way between the sternum and the spine: for the outer layer, beginning at the spine, ceases at the cartilages of the ribs; while the inner, com- mencing at the sternum, ceases at the angles of the ribs. The intercostal muscles present a curious intermixture of tendi- nous and fleshy fibres ; and they are covered both inside and out- side the chest by a glistening fascia, to give greater protection to the»intercostal spaces. The external intercostal muscles elevate the ribs, and are there- fore muscles of inspiration. The internal intercostal muscles de- press the ribs, and are therefore muscles of expiration. Intercostal ^^^""^ ^'"^^^^^ intercostal arteries on each side, i arteries. ^he two upper are supplied by the intercostal branch of the subclavian; the remaining ten are supplied by the aorta: and since this vessel lies rather on the left side of the spine, the right intercostal arteries are longer than the left. The upper intercostal arteries from the aorta ascend obliquely to reach their intercostal spaces; the lower run more transversely. Havin<y reached the intercostal space, each artery divides into an anteriol and a posterior branch. The anterior branch, in direction and size, appears to be the continuation of the common trunk. At first it runs along the i middle of the ^ntercostal space, and is separated from the cavitv of f the chest by the pleura and intercostal fascia. Here, therefore it ns liable to be injured by a woimd in the back. But near ^he angle of the rib it passes between the intercostal muscles, and occupies the groove m the lower border of the rib. Here too it gives off a branch, which runs for some distance along the' upper iborder of the rib below, and is lost in the muscles.

475 LIGAMENTS OF THE KNEE. Internal lateral. Fig. 106. Let lis first examine the tendons concerned in the con- Ugamont. struction of the capsular ligament. In front is the liga- mentum patellee; on either side are the tendons of the vasti; at the back of the joint no less than four tendons contribute to form the capsule,—namely, the tendons of the gastrocnemius, the tendon of the semi-membranosus, and of the popliteus. It deserves to be noticed that the weakest part of the capsule is near the tendon of the popliteus: here, therefore, matter formed in the popliteal space may possibly make its way into the joint, or vice versa. Exclusive of the capsule, the proper ligaments of the joint are — 1, the lateral; and 2, the crucial in the interior. This is a broad flat band, which extends from the inner condyle to the inner side of the tibia, a little below its head. A few of the deeper fibres are attached to the inner semilunar cartilage, and serve to keep it in place. In the perfori^ance of the several motions of the joint, there is a certain amount of friction between the ligament and the head of the tibia, and consequently a small bursa is interposed. ^ ^ ^ This is a strong round band, lateral which extends from the ou.ter condyle to the head of the fibula. In some instances there is a smaller band a little deeper, called the | short external lateral ligament. This, which is generally called "ligamentum posticum Winslowii," consists of expansions de- rived from the tendons at the back of the joint, chiefly, however, from the semi- membranosus. It not only closes and protects the joint behind, but prevents its extension beyond the perpendicular. The joint should be opened above the patella. Observe the great extent of the fold which the synovial membrane forms above Posterior. 1. Internal lateral ligament. 2. External ditto.

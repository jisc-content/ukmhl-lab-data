LIGAMENTS OP THE RIBS. 194 Pig. 39. DIAGEAH OF THE ODONTOID AND TEANSYEKSE LIGAMENTS. The head of each rib presents two articular surfaces, correspondiag to the bodies of two vertebrse. There are two distinct articulations, each provided with a separate synovial membrane. The ligaments are : 1. An anterior, which connects the head of the rib with the vertebrae, and with the intervening fibro-cartilage: this, on account of the divergence of its fibres, is called, the " stellate " ligament. 2. An inter-articular, which proceeds from the head of the rib to the intervertebrah cartilage. The tubercle of the rib articulates with the transverse process. This articulation has a capsular and synovial membrane, and is secured by the following ligaments: â€”1. The ^posterior costo- transverse passes from the apex of the transverse process to the tubercle of the rib. 2. The middle costo-transverse connects the neck of the rib to the front surface of the transverse process. 3. The anterior costo-transverse ascends from the neck of the rib to the lower border of the transverse process above it. The head of the first rib articulates with a single vertebra. ^ The eleventh and twelfth ribs articulate each with a single vertebra, and are not connected to the transverse processes.

333 LUMBAR PLEXUS. The external cutaneous nerve of the thigh (c) is generally de- rived from the second lumbar nerve. It runs through the psoas, then, crossing obliquely the iliacus towards the spine of the ilium, passes beneath the crural arch, and is finally distributed to the skin on the outside of the thigh.* The genito-cniral nerve is of small size, and generally comes from the second lumbar. After perforating the psoas, it descends along the outer side of the external iliac artery, and near the crural arch divides into the genital branch ((/), which runs through the inguinal canal, and is lost in the cremaster muscle, â€” and the crural (e), which proceeds under the crural arch, and is lost in the skin of the upper part of the thigh. The anterior crural (d) is the largest and most important branch of the plexus, and is generally formed by the union of the third and fourth lumbar nerves. It descends in a groove between the psoas and the iliacus, supplies both these muscles, and then, passing under the crural arch, is finally distributed to the extensor muscles and the skin of the thigh. The obturator nerve (/) is next in size to the anterior crural. It proceeds from the third and fourth lumbar nerves, descends by the side of the pelvis to the obturator foramen, and is distributed to the adductor muscles of the thigh. Postponing the minute anatomy of the abdominal viscera, let us begin the examination of the contents of the pelvis. DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. First refresh your memory of the purposes served by the pelvis, and, what is of more practical importance, of the direction of its axis. The purposes of the pelvis are to protect its own viscera, and to support those of the abdomen ; to give attachment to the muscles which steady the trunk; to transmit the weight of the trunk to the * If the external cutaneous be not seen in its usual situation, look for it is i dis tinct branch of the anterior crural, nearer the psoas muscle.

MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER. 25^ Fig. 47. tween the bundles for the attachment of the muscular fibres. The annexed woodcut shows this beautiful arrangement better than any description. The action of the muscle is not only concentrated upon one point, but its power is also greatly increased, by this arrangement. It raises the arm; but it cannot do so to a greater the ddtoid. ^^^^J degrees. The elevation of the arm beyond this angle, is effected through the elevation of the shoulder by means of the trapezius and serratus magnus. Its anterior fibres draw the arm forwards; its posterior, backwards. This powerful muscle is well sup- plied with blood, by the anterior and posterior circumflex, the tho- racica humeraria, the thoracica acromialis, all from the axillary artery; also by the deltoid branch of the brachial. Its nerve is the circumflex. The deltoid gives the rotundity to the shoulder. When the head of the humerus is dislocated into the axilla, the fibres of the muscle rrm vertically to their insertion; hence the flattening of the deltoid, and the gi-eater prominence of the acromion. It is just below the deltoid that we generally meet with ununited fragmlnt''^ ^"^^ ' '^"'''^^ ""^'''"^ the upper Eeflect the deltoid from its origin. Observe the ramifications of the circumflex artery and nerve, on its under surface; also the lar^e bursa between it and the head of the humerus. See how the muscle protects the shoulder-joint; how it covers the coraco-acromial li^a! rnent, the head, neck and upper part of the humerus, as welf as the tendons inserted into the greater tuberosity.

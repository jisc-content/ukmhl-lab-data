255 MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER. into two layers, one of which passes over, the other under, the muscle. Eemove the aponeurosis from the muscles, so far as it can be done without injury to the muscular fibres which arise frofa its under surface. This muscle mnses from the greater part of the infra- nSit'^'' scapular fossa. The fibres converge to a tendon, which is at first contained in the substance of the muscle, and then proceeds over the capsule of the shoulder-joint, to be inserted into the greater tuberosity of the humerus. Teres minor. ™^ ^^^^ narrow muscle is situated below the infi-a- spinatus, along the inferior border of the scapula. It arises from the dorsum of the scapula, close to the inferior border. The fibres ascend parallel with those of the infi-a-spinatus, and terminate in a tendon, which passes over the capsule of the shoulder- joint,^ and is inserted into the greater tuberosity of the humerus. Some of the fibres of the muscle are attached directly into the bone. It is supplied by a branch of the circumflex nerve. The action of the infra-spinatus and teres minor is to rotate the humerus outwards. Teres major. "^'^'^^^ i« ^^o^ely connected with the latissimus dorsi, and extends from the inferior angle of the scapula to the humerus, contributing to form the posterior boundary of the axilla. It arises from the flat surface at the inferior angle of the back of the scapula, and terminates upon a flat tendon, two inches m breadth, which is inserted into the inner edge of the bicipital groove of the humerus, behind the tendon of the latissimus dorsi (p. 210). Its act%on is to draw the humerus backwards. By dissecting between the two tendons, you will find that they are separated by a bursa.

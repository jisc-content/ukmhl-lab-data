56 MUSCLES OF THE FACE. lip. It is neai-ly an inch in breadth at its origin, and it covers the infra-orbital vessels and nerves. This arises from the canine fossa of the superior Leyator au- j^axillary bone, below the infra-orbital foramen, and is ^ inserted into the angle of the mouth. This muscle lies beneath, and is covered by the levator labii superioris. i, + • Now examine two muscles belonging to the nose — the trian- gularis or compressor nasi, and the depressor labii superioris. This arises from the superior maxillary bone, near the Compres- ^j^e j^ose, and is inserted into the dorsum of the nose with its fellow of the opposite side. The origin of this muscle is concealed by the levator labii superioris ala^que nasi. This anses from the superior maxillary bone, above faS;:. the second incisor tooth, and is inserted into the septum and ala of the nose. It is situated between the mucous membrane and the muscular structure of the upper lip. To expose rSe upper lip must be everted and the mucous membrane re- Besides the muscles above described, we find, in connection with the cartilages of the ala of the nose, pale muscular fibres, m which no definite arrangement can be traced. They constitute the ™or«mautmo.''andthe"^ of some anatomists. By acting upon the cartilages of the nose, Lse little muscles contribute in some degree to express the con- dition of the mind. Some of them dilate the nostrils; for instance in dvsTml • others contract them, as in smelling, when we smff up the aHwLrds the olfactory nerve.

CONTENTS OF TEMALE PELVIS. 382 perforated by several openings {Hymen crih'ifomis), or by one only {Hymen circularis). Again, there may be no opening at all in it, and then it is called Hymen imperforatus. Under this last condition no inconvenience arises till puberty. The menstrual discharge must then necessarily accumulate in the vagina: indeed, the uterus itself may become distended, and to such a degree as even to simulate pregnancy.* The presence of the hymen is not necessarily a proof of virginity, nor does its absence imply the loss of it. Cases are related by writers on midwifery in which a division of the hymen was requisite to facilitate parturition. In Meckel's Museum, at Halle, are pre- served the external organs of a female in whom the hymen is per- fect even after the birth of a seven-months child. . At the lower part of the orifice of the vagina is, im- Uowper s or i- o y Duverney's bedded in the loose tissue on either side, a gland f glands. about the size of a small pea. Each has a long slender duct, which runs forwards and opens on the inner side of the nympha. In cases of virulent gonorrhoea these glands are apt to become diseased, and give rise to the formation of an abscess in the labium, which is very difficult to heal. The description of the perineal branches of the pudic vessels and nerves, given in the dissection of the male perineum, applies, mutatis mutandis, to the female, excepting that they are propor- tionably small, and that the artery which supplies the bulb of the urethra in the male is distributed to the bulb of the vagina in the female. DISSECTION OF THE FEMALE PELVIS. It is presumed that you have some knowledge of the anatomy of the viscera in the male pelvis. Our present concern is, to examine the organs superadded in the female, viz. the uterus and its appen- * See Burns' Midwifery. t See Professor Tiedemann, Von den Duverneyschen Driisen den Weibs.

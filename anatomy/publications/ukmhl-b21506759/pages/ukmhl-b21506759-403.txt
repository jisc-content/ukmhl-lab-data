Supposing the vagina to be laid open, we observe that it is lined by a mucous membrane of a pale rose colour: and that this mem- brane IS rough and forrowed, especially near the orifice. A more or less prominent ridge runs along its anterior, and another alono- Its posterior wall. From either side of these, which are called cohcmnce rugarum," proceed a series of transverse ridges with rough jagged margins directed forwards. They are well marked m young females who are still virgins, but repeated parturition and mcreasmg age gradually smooths them down. The use of the vaginal rug^ is to excite the sensibility of the glans in coition. They themselves also possess keen sensibility, for they are richly provided with papillse. The mucous membrane has a thick epithelial Hning, and in the submucous tissue is an abundant supply of muciparous glands!

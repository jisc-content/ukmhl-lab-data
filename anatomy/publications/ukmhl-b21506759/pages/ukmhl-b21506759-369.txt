SIDE VIEW or THE PELVIC VISCERA. 355 hemorrhoidcal plexus, or veins about the anus, and they receive the blood returning from the penis through the large veins which pass under the pubic arch. This is one of the reasons why the prostatic plexus is so capacious. If, in lithotomy, the incision be carried beyond the limits of the prostate, the great veins around it must necessarily be divided : these, independently of any artery, are quite sufficient to occasion very serious hemorrhage.

P^-^^^' '^^^^ ^^^ore its termination, the bowel curves downwards so that the anal aperture is dependent. The rectum is not throughout of equal calibre. Its capacity becomes greater as it descends into the pelvis ; and, immediately above the sphmeter, it presents a considerable dilatation (fig. 75 p 351) This dilatation is not material in early life, but it increases as ac^e advances. An adequate idea of it cannot be formed unless the bowel be fully distended. Under such circumstances the rectum loses altogether its cylindrical form, and bulges up on either side ot the prostate and the base of the bladder. For this reason it is ormhotomy * '^'^'''^ ^^^""^^ ^"^^^'^^ ^^^^""^ operation The upper part of the rectum is connected to the sacrum by a lold ot peritoneum termed " meso-rechim:' In this fold the terminal branch of the inferior mesenteric artery with its vein runs up to supply the bowel. Below the meso-rectum, the gut is con- nected to the sacrum and coccyx by an abundance of loose cellular tissue, which allows its easy disteusion. This explains why fistu- lous passages are so apt to burrow in this direction _ The relations of the front part of the rectum,_that, namelv r :rt:nt f ^^^^^ the^anus-'ai.; m It impoitant To put this matter in the most practical light, we will uppose the forefinger to be introduced into the anus and a catheter m the urethra.

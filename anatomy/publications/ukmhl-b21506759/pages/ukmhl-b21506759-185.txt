171 OTIC GANGLION. The otic or auricular ganglion was discovered and glion.^*"' described by Arnold, a Grerman anatomist, in 1826.* "It is situated," be says, "on the inner side of the inferior maxillary division of the fifth pair, immediately below its exit through the foramen ovale. (See diagram, page 169.) Its inner surface is in contact with the circumflexus palati muscle and the cartilage of the Eustachian tube, and immediately behind it is the middle meningeal artery." It is always of very small size; and, since we have sometimes failed in finding it, we conclude it is not present in all subjects.f facial. THs opinion is supported by cases in -vrHcla the uvula is stated to liave been drawn on one side in consequence of paralysis of the opposite facial nerve. However, we have not succeeded in tracing the nerve into these muscles. b. Sjpheno-palatine or nasal branches.—These, three or four in number, pass through the spheno-paJatine foramen to the mucous membrane of the nose; but they aie very dehcate. To see them clearly, the part should have been steeped for some tune in dilute nitric acid: afterwards, when weU washed, these minute nerves may be easily recognised beneath the mucous membrane covering the spongy bones. Most of them ramify upon the outer waU of the nose and the spongy bones. One branch, fig 37 originaUy caUed by Scarpa " naso-palatine," ti-averses the roof of the nose, distributes filaments to the back part of the septum narium, and then proceeds obHquely forwards along the septum to the foramen incisivnm, through which it passes, and finaUy terminates m the palate behind the incisor teeth. According to Cloquet, the corresponding nerves of opposite sides unite at the foramen incisivum in a smaU gangUon which he caUs the « naso-palatine " Dissert sur les Odeurs et les Organes de 1'Olfaction: Paris, 1815. c. Branches to the pharynx and Eustachian tube.—In parts prepared for the pur- pose we may sometimes trace minute filaments to the mucous membrane of the back of the nares, the Eustachian tube, and sphenoidal sinus. d Vidian branch.—This proceeds, from the posterior part of the gangHon back- wards through the vidian canal of the sphenoid bone, traverses the flbro-caitUage at the base of the skull, and here divides into two branches, fig. 38. One joins the sym pathetic plexus about the internal carotid artery; the other (sometimes caUed the areat petrosal) entevs the craniimi, runs under the Gasserian gangUon and the dura mater m a small groove on the petrous portion of the temporal bone, enters the "hiatu^ f r '^"^"^ ^* ^^^^ -erve proceed^ not from, but to the gangHon, and that it is the medium through wMch motor filaments are conveyed to it. »v"ii,u motor * J.

A MANUAL OF THE DISSECTIOI^ OF THE HUMAK BODY. THE DISSECTION OF THE NECK. ]\Iake an incision through the skin, down the middle of the neck from the jaw to the sternum; a second along the clavicle to the acromion; a third along the base of the jaw as far as the mastoid process. Keflect the skin, and expose the cutaneous muscle called the platysma myoides. Between the platysma and the skin is a layer of adipose tissue, sometimes called the "superficial fascia." It varies in thickness in different subjects, but is gene- rally more abundant at the upper part of the neck, especially in corpulent individuals, in whom it occasions a double chin. The platysma myoides is the cutaneous muscle of myofd".'' ^^'^^^^ subcutaneous tissue over the pectoralis major and deltoid muscles; thence proceeding over the clavicle and the side of the neck, its fibres become more closely aggregated, and terminate thus:â€”The anterior cross those of the opposite platysma, immediately below the symphysis of the jaw, and are lost in the skin of the chin; the middle are attached along the base of the jaw ; the posterior cross the masseter muscle, and terminate partly in the subcutaneous tissue of the cheek' partly in the muscles at the corner of the mouth. The platysma forms a strong muscular defence for the neck

BACK OF THE THIGH. 454 djle. It joins the longer part of the muscle, and both terminate on a common tendon, which is inserted into the head of the fibula. It also gives off a strong expansion to the fascia of the leg. The tendon covers part of the external lateral ligameot of the knee- joint, and a small bursa intervenes.* The biceps is not only a flexor of the leg, but rotates the leg, when bent, outwards. It is this muscle which dislocates the knee outwards and backwards in chronic disease of the joint. This arises, in common with the biceps, from the Semitendi- -^^^^ ^^^^^ q£ ^j^g ^^j^er ischii. The fibres terminate ' upon a long tendon, which spreads out below the knee- joint, and is inserted into the inner surface of the tibia below the tendons of the sartorius and gracilis. Like them, it plays over the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint, and is provided with a b\u:sa to prevent friction. The semitendinosus sends off from the lower border of its tendon a very strong fascia to cover the leg, which is attached along the inner edge of the tibia. The middle of the muscle is cm-iously intersected by an oblique tendinous line. This muscle arises from the tuber ischii, outside the Semimem- ^.^^ preceding, by means of a strong flat tendon which branoBus. ^^^^^^ ^^^^.^y j^^lf Way down the thigh. It forms a - bulky muscle which lies on a deeper plane than the others, and is inserted by a thick tendon into the posterior part of the head of the tibia. In connection with this tendon there are three additional points to be noted—1, that its tendon is prolonged under the internal lateral ligament of the knee, and that a bursa intervenes between them; 2, that it forms the principal constituent of the " liaamentum posticum Winslowii " which covers the back of the knee-joint; 3, that a fascia proceeds from its lower border, and binds down the popliteus. A large bursa is almost invariably found between the semi- membranosus and the inner head of the gastrocnemius, where they rub one against the other. It is generally from one and a * THs tendon can be plainly felt as the outer hamstring in one's own person, just above'the head of the fibula.

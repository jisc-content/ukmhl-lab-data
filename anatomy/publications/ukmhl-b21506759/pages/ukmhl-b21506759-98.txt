DISSECTION OF THE CHEST. 84 3. Rigtt and left bracliio-cephalic veins and superior vena cava. 4. Course aud relations of the arch of the aorta. 6. The three great branches of the arch. 6. Com-se of the phrenic nerves. . 7. Posterior mediastmum and its contents; namely, the aorta, the thoracic aucr, the vena azygos, the ojsophaguB, and pneumogastric nerves. 8. Sympathetic nerve. 9. Intercostal muscles, vessels, and nerves. 10. Cardiac plexus of nerves. 11. Position and relations of the heart. 12. Pericardium. 13. Position and form of the lungs. 14. Pleura. In the first place you must make a window into the chest, by carefully removing the sternum and the cartilages of all the true ribs * Cut through the cartilages of the ribs, close to the bone of the'rib, and then raise the sternum with its attached cartilages; m doing this take care not to wound the pleura which is closely connected with the cartilages. On one side remove the internal mammary artery, on the other leave it. On the under surface of the sternum and cartilages^of the ribs thus removed, is a muscle named " triangularis sterm. This muscle arises from the ensiform cartilage and Triangularis ^^^^ lower part of the sternum, and is inserted by digi- tations into the cartilages of the true ribs from the second to the sixth; its fibres ascend outwards to their insertion; its action therefore is to depress the costal cartilages It is one o •the muscles which act on emergency in expiration ItB-ivecomes from the intercostal nerves; its arteries from the mternal mam- This is a branch of the subclavian.

Thus the stomach is supplied with blood by four channels, which by their inosculations form a main artery along its lesser curve, another along its greater; from these, numerous branches are furnished to both sides of the stomach. The artery of the greater curve also sends down nume- rous branches to the omen- ^ig- *53. tum, which form a beautiful network between its layers. The advantage of this free inosculation of arteries about the stomach paust be appa- rent.

The trunk of the vena portse itself is from three to four inches long; if you trace it down- wards you find that it is formed behind the pancreas, by the confluence of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins (fig. 63). Traced upwards you would find that at the transverse fissure of the liver it divides into branches corresponding to the several lobes of the organ. The DIAGRAM OF THE YliNA P0BT2E.

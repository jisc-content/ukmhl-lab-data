65 TEMPORAL REGION, branches, of which some, ascending beneath the orbicularis, supply the lower eyelid; others pass inwards to supply the nose; by far the gi-eater number descend into the upper lip, and eventually terminate in lashes of filaments, which endow the papillse of the lip -with exquisite sensibility. The infra-orbital artery is the terminal branch of the internal maxillary; it supplies the muscles and skin, and inosculates with branches of the facial. The mental nerve is a branch of the inferior maxillary or third division of the fifth nerve. It emerges from the mental foramen in the lower jaw, in a direction upwards and backwards, beneath the depressor labii inferioris. It soon divides into a number of branches, some of which supply the skin of the chin, but the greater number ascend to the lower lip, in the papillae of which they terminate. The mental artery is a branch of the inferior dental. It supplies the gums and the chin, and inosculates with the sub-mental and inferior coronary arteries. MUSCLES OF MASTICATION. —TEMPORAL AND SPHENO- MAXILLARY REGIONS. In the dissection we are about to commence, I advise you to examine the parts in the following order : — 1. Superficial arteries and nei-ves of the 6. Pterygoid muscles. temple. 6. Internal maxillaiy artery and 2. Masseter muscle, branches. 3. Temporal aponeurosis. 7. Inferior maxillary nerve and 4. Temporal muscle. branches. Reflect the skin of the temple in any way most convenient. Under the skin you will come upon a layer of tough fibro-cellular tissue, which is continuous, above, with the aponeurosis of the scalp, below, with the fascia covering the masseter and the parotid gland. In this tissue are contained the superficial temporal vessels and nerves, of which let us trace the ramifications.

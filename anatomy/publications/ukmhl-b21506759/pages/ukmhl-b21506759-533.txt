Thirty-one pair of nerves arise from the spinal Spinal neeves. , , .i • ■ .i cord, — namely, 8 m the cervical region, 12 in the dorsal, 5 in the lumbar, 5 in the sacral, and 1 in the coccygeal. Each nerve comes off by two distinct series of roots, — one from Two roots front, the other from the back of the cord. We sensitive are indebted to Sir Charles Bell for the discovery of the and motor. ^^^^ ^^^^ ^-^^ anterior roots consist exclusively of motor filaments, the posterior exclusively of sensitive. All converge and unite in the corresponding intervertebral foramen to form a single nerve, composed of both motor and sensitive filaments. The posterior or sensitive roots proceed from the posterior lateral groove of the cord, and are thicker and more numerous than the anterior,* But the most remarkable thing about them is, that, previous to their union with the anterior roots, they are collected together and pass thi'ough a ganglion. This ganglion is of an oval form, and lies in the intervertebral foramen, just where the roots of the nerves pass through the dura mater.f * The researches of Blandin, Anat. descript. t. ii., p. 648, 1838, have led him to establish the foUovdng relation between the respective size of the anterior and pos- terior roots of the nerves in the several regions of the spine: — The posterior roots are to the anterior in the cervical region )> )> „ dorsal ,, 1) i> „ lumbar and sacral This relation quite accords with the greater delicacy of the sense of touch in the upper extremity. t The ganglia of the two last sacral nerves He within the dura mater.

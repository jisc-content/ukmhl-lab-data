From the external side of the arch, near the metacarpal bone of the thumb, the superficial radial veins run up the outer and front part of the forearm to the bend of the elbow. From the internal side of the arch, near the metacarpal bone of the little finger, the superficial ulnar veins proceed along the inner and front side of the forearm to the elbow. Along the middle of the forearm runs the median vein, which is formed by the superficial veins in front of the wrist, and terminates at the elbow by joining the cephalic and the basilic veins. The fascia which envelopes the muscles of the fore- Fascia of the g^jcj^ i'g much stronger than that of the upper arm, and fove^m. .^^ strength increases as it approaches the wrist, that the tendons in this situation may be effectually maintained in their proper place. The fascia is attached to the condyles of the humerus, and is strengthened by fibres from the tendons of the biceps and bra- chialis anticus. The aponeurotic expansion from the inner edge of the tendon ot the biceps is exceedingly strong, it braces the muscles on the inner side of the arm, and interlaces at right angles with the fibres of the fascia attached to the internal condyle. Along the forearm the fascia is attached to the ridge on the pos- terior part of the ulna. At the back of the wiist it forms the pos- terior annular ligament. On the front of the wrist it is continued into the anterior annular ligament. The under surface of the fascia gives origin to the muscular fibres in the upper part of the forearm, and furnishes septa, which separate the muscles and form so many distinct sheaths for them. ' , Kemove the fascia from the muscles, and preserve them as much as possible in their proper relative position. But before we exa- mine them in detail, let us direct our attention to the important triangular space at the bend of the elbow.

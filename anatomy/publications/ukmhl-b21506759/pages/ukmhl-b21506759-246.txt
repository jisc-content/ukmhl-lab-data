These tendons lie upon the same plane, and pass beneath the annular ligament under those of the super- ficial flexor, into the palm. On the first phalanx of the fingers, the tendons of the deep flexor perforate those of the superficial, and are inserted into the base of the third or ungual phalanx. This muscle is situated on the front surface of the fongus radius. It arises from the front surface of the radu;s pollicis. between the tubercle and the pronator qnadratus, and from the interosseous membrane.* Its tendon proceeds beneath the annular ligament to the last phalanx of the thumb. to.

It rotates the radms on the ulna. . ^ ^i. • „ i.u^ Nearly on a level with the msertion of the biceps, the S:S""'^\lnar artery gives off from its outer side the com.ron interosseous trunk, which runs backwards for about half an mch, and divides into the anterior and posterior interosseous. _ The anterior interosseous artery runs down close to the mter- osseous membrane, lying between the flexor Vro^^f-^^S^Z and flexor longus pollicis.

The smallest ramifications spread out in a brush- like manner through the pulp, and then lead into the veins. The veins themselves form in the pulp a minute network. But this part of the circulation is not yet thoroughly made out. Thus, it appears that the spleen is essentially a great blood gland: that it consists of chambers filled with secreting gland cells of va- rious size, between which ramify minute arteries and veins. It is prestimed that ,the cells in some way or other elaborate the blood. Some physiologists consider the spleen to be the bu-th-place of the white corpuscles of the blood. Others have arrived at the conclu- sion that it serves as the grave- yard of the red ones. The precise function of the organ is unknown. With the form and colour of the kidney, aU are familiar. Its weight is about five ounces in the male, rather less the female. In the majority in SECTION OF THE KIDNEY. 1. Ureter. 2. Pelvis of tlae kidney. 3. 3, 3.

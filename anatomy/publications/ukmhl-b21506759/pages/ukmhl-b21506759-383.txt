STRUCTURE OF THE PROSTATE. 369 Sir Charles Bell * who first drew attention to them, believed them to be of use in regulating the orifices of the ureters, and named them "the muscles of the ureters." The ridges, converging from the ureters, together with an imaginary horizontal Hue drawn between their orifices, include a triangular area called, by the French anatomists, the " trigone vesi- cale." The mucous membrane of this area is always firmly adherent to the subjacent tissue, and is therefore perfectly smooth. It IS more richly provided with blood-vessels and nerves than the rest of the bladder, and is in consequence endowed with more diHcate sensibiHty. This is the reason why a stone gives more pain when the bladder is empty, and why it is more painful in the erect than m any other position of the body. The bladder is supplied with blood, by " superior," "middle" and "mferior" vesical arteries. The superior comes from the umbihcal: the middle from the internal iliac: the inferior from the pudic. Prostate. having already examined the form, size, and relations of the prostate, p. 359. You have now only to make out Its two lateral symmetrical lobes. There is, also, a third or middle lobe t It unites the lateral lobes, and is situated above the semi- nal ducts. In the healthy state of parts, this does not appear like a separate lobe; but when abnormally enlarged, it projects towards the cavity of the bladder, and acts like a bar at the mouth of the urethra. Make a longitudinal incision through the prostate in order to expose the urethra. Notice that the canal does not run exactly * Med. Chii-. Trans, vol. iii.

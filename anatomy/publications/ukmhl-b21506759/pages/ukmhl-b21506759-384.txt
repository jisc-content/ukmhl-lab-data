370 STRUCTURE Ol? THE PROSTATE. in tlie centre of the gland, but rather nearer to its upper surface ; nor is it of the same calibre throughout. It forms a sinus in the interior of the prostate, as though the gland had been purposely hollowed out; and this is what anatomists mean when they speak of the " sinus of the prostate." Along the floor of this sinus is a longitudinal ridge, which is broad and elevated behind, but gra- dually loses itself forwards in a narrow point. This is called the crest of the urethra, and the most prominent part of it is named the « caput gallinaginis;' from its supposed resemblance to the head of a woodcock. The seminal ducts open close to each other, one on either side of this prominence (p. 367). Immediately in front of the caput gallinaginis, precisely m the middle line, is a small opening, into which you should pass a probe to ascertain that it leads backwards into a little cul-de-sac or pouch in the substance of the prostate. This pouch is described as the analocrueof the uterus, and called the " uiWcu^usbut strictly speaktna, it is the remains of the primordial sac out of which the parts were formed. It is of a pyriform shape, with the narrowest part at the orifice, and its length is about five or six lines. _ Prac- tically it deserves attention because in some persons it is large enough to catch the end of a small catheter. Lastly, we have to notice the minute orifices of the proper ducts of the prostate , and ■ these are best seen on the floor of the sinus. Now the whole sub- stance of the gland is permeated by the divisions and subdivisions of these ducts. They are not visible to the naked eye, but if one of them were thoroughly traced out with the microscope, it wou^d be seen to terminate in a blind sacculated extremity, upon which the capillaries ramify in rich profusion.f of life.

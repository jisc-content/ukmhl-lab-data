MUSCLES OF THE BACK CONNECTED WITH THE ARM. 249 Formed by the union of these roots, the nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, and leaves it again through the foramen jugulare. It then runs behind the internal jugular vein, traverses obliquely the upper third of the sterno-mastoid, and crosses the posterior triangle of the neck to the trapezius, which it supplies, (p. 11.) Beneath the trapezius we have to examine four muscles con- nected with the scapula, namely, the levator anguli scapulae, the omo-hyoideus, the rhomboideus major and minor. To clean these muscles, the scapula must be adjusted so as to stretch their fibres. This muscle is situated at the side of the neck. It gSiscapSffi ^^^^s by four tendons from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the four upper cervical ver- tebrae. The muscular slips to which the tendons give rise, form a single muscle, which descends down the side of the neck, and is inserted into the posterior border of the scapula between its spine and superior angle. Its action is to raise the posterior angle of the scapula; as, for instance, in shrugging the shoulders. Its nerve comes from the fifth cervical.

The rhomboideus minor, the higher of the two, arises by a thin aponeurosis from the spinous processes of the last cervical and the first dorsal vertebra, and is inserted into the base of the scapula opposite its spine. The rhomboideus major arises by tendinous fibres from the spinous processes of the four or five upper dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted by fleshy fibres into the base of the scapula between its spine and inferior angle. The action of these muscles is to draw the scapula upwards and backwards. They are the antagonists of the serratus magnus. The nerve of the rhomboid muscles (posterior scapular) is a branch of the fifth cervical nerve. It passes outwards beneath the lower part of the levator anguli scapulae, to which it sends a branch, and is lost in the under surface of the rhomboid muscles.

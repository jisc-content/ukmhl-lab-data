The middle cervical ganglion is something less than a barley- corn in size. It is situated behind the carotid sheath, about the fifth or sixth cervical vertebra, near the inferior thyroid artery. It receives branches from the fifth and sixth spinal nerves, and frZches to the thyroid body.-These accompany the inferior thyroid artery. ■, . r 4. e b Branch to the heart.-This usually descends m front of the subclavian artery into the chest, and joins the cardiac plexus. In cases where the middle cervical ganglion is absent, the pre- ceding nerves are supplied by the sympathetic cord connectmg the superior and inferior ganglia. ; The inferior cervical ganglion is of considerable size, ^d is situated in the interval between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the first rib, immediately behind the vertebral artery. It receives branches from the seventh and eighth spinal nerves, and others which, descending from the fourth fifth and sixth, through the foramina in the transverse processes of the vertebrae, form a plexus around the vertebral artery. The only branch which it gives off IS —.. . a Inferior cardiac ,r™.-This communicates with the re- current laryngeal, and joins the cardiac plexus beneath the arch of the aorta. DISSECTION OF THE CHEST. Before we examine the several organs contained in the chest, we ought to have some knowledge of it« frame-work. The true nbs with their cartilages describe a series of arcs, increasing m length from above downwards, and form, with the spine and the sternum, a

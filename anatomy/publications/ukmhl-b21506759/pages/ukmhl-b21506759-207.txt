LIGAMENTS CONNECTING THE HEAD TO THE SPINE. 193 region there is very little mobility, on account of the vertical direction of the articular processes, and the manner in which the arches and the spines overlap each other. In the lumbar region, the spine again becomes more moveable, on account of the thick- ness of the intervertebral cartilages, and the horizontal direction of the spinous processes. Ligaments ^he occiput is connected to the atlas by an anterior SitTl(occipito-atlantoid) membrane which passes from the bone and foramen magnum to the front part of the atlas. The rertSa. thickest part of this is in the middle. A ^posterior (occipito-atlantoid) membrane extends in a similar manner from the posterior border of the foramen magnum to the arch of the atlas. It is perforated by the vertebral artery. Ligaments ^^^^^ ^^'^ important; and to see them, we between the ^^^^ expose the spinal canal by removing the arches bonSSthe ^PP^^ oexYic&l vertebrae, and the posterior axis. common Hgament, which is here very thick and strong. It descends from the basilar process of the occipital bone over the odontoid and transverse ligaments. Odontoid The odontoid or check ligaments (fig. 39) are two Hgamenl '^'^''^ ligaments which proceed from the sides of the odontoid process to the tubercles on the inner sides of the condyles of the occiput. Their use is to limit the rotation of the head. Articula- J^^ odontoid process of the axis forms a pivot upon tion be- which the head and atlas rotate.

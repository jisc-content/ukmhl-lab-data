POSITION OF ABDOMINAL VISCEKA. 301 Changes ro- Whoever has the opportunity of dissecting an old clucedbyan hernia of some size, will observe that the obliquity heriii^^'^^^ ing-viinal canal is destroyed. The constant dragging of the protruded viscera gradually bring s the internal ring nearer to the external, so that at last the one gets quite behind the other, and there is a direct opening into the abdomen. But the position of the epigastric artery with regard to the sac remains unaltered. It is still on the inner side of the neck of the sac. In hernise of long standing, aU its coverings undergo a change. They become thickened and hypertrophied to such an extent, and so altered from what they once were, that they scarcely look Hke the same parts. Now expose the contents of the abdomen by a crucial incision, and take a general survey of the viscera before they are disturbed from their relative position. What is seen . ^'^^^^ hypochondrium the liver is seen project- on opening mg more or less below the cartilages of the ribs, and men"? Â°' ^^^^^us of the gaU-bladder below the edge of the liver, near the end of the ninth costal cartilage. Such IS generally the case in the dead body. But remember that in a state of health, the edge of the liver ought not to project much, if at all, below the false ribs : it does so, however, in children, and in women; m children, by reason of the large size of the liver - in women, by reason of the use of stays. In the left hypochondrium IS seen more or less of the stomach. Across the umbilical re-ion IS a portion of the large intestine called the transverse colon; from this there descends a broad fold of peritoneum, called the great omentum, looking like a curtain of fat over the convolutions of the small intestines; but the breadth of this fold varies in different instances ; sometimes it is contracted and crumpled. The lower part of the belly and part of the pelvis is occupied by Ihe small intestines. The urinary bladder is not apparent^ unless dTs! tended sufficiently to rise out of the pelvis.

DISSECTION OF THE FUONT OP THE ITOREARM. 225 Triangle at '^^^ pronator teres on the ulnar side, and the supi- the bend of nator longus on the radial, form two sides of a tri- contents. ^^S^^^^^' space at the bend of the elbow, of which you must carefully make out the contents; namely: — 1. the brachial artery (with its companion veins), dividing into the radial and ulnar; 2. The tendon of the biceps on its outer side; 3. The median nerve close to its inner side*; 4. The radial recurrent artery; 5. The anterior ulnar recurrent ai-tery; 6. The common interosseous branch of the ubiar artery; 7. The musculo- spiral nerve, deep in the groove between the brachialis anticus and the supinator radii longus, where it divides into the "radial," which accompanies the radial artery, and the posterior interosseous, which perforates the supinator brevis, and supplies the muscles on the back of the forearm. , „ The muscles of the forearm are arranged in two Muscles of . ,. „ o the forearm, g^o^ps = One gToup, consistmg of pronators and flexors, is attached to the internal condyle; the other, consist- ing of supinators and extensors, is attached to the external.

It arises from the anterior siu-face of the internal condyle, and from the septum between it and the flexor carpi radiaUs. It has also a small tendinous origin, from the coronoid process of the ulna. From these two origins, which are separated by the median nerve, the muscle pro- ceeds obliquely downwards, and is inserted by a flat tendon into a rough surface on the outer and back part of the middle of the radius. In amputating the forearm, it is very desirable to save the msertion of this muscle, that the stump may have a pronator.

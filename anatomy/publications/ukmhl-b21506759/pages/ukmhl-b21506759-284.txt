LIGAMENTS OF THE CLAVICLE. 270 The anterior- sterno-clavicular ligament (fig. 50), consists of a broad band of ligamentous fibres, which pass obliquely downwards and inwards over the front of the joint, from the end of the clavicle to the anterior surface of the sternum. Kg. 50. DIAGEAM or THE STEHNO-CLAVICUIAE LIGAMENTS. 1. Interclavicular ligament. 2. Anterior sterno-clavicular ligament. 3. Costo-clavicular ligament. 4. Interarticular fibro-caxtilage. A similar band, called the posterior sterno-clavicular ligament, extends over the back of the joint, from the back of the clavicle to the back of the sternum. The clavicles are connected by the inter-clavicular ligament. It extends transversely above the notch of the sternum, and has a broad attachment to the upper border of each clavicle. Between the clavicles it is more or less attached to the sternum, so that it forms a curve with the concavity upwards. The three ligaments just described are so closely connected, that, collectively, they form a complete fibrous capsule of great strength for the joint. , , ., , A ligament, called the costo-clavicular or rhomboid, connects the clavicle to the cartilage of the first rib. It ascends from the cartilage of the rib to a rough surface beneath the sternal end ot the clavicle. Its use is to limit the elevation of the clavicle. There is such constant movement between the clavicle and the cartilage

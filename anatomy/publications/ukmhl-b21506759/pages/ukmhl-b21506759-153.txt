139 DISSECTION OF THE LARYNX. by the constrictors of the pharynx, the food passes into the oeso- phagus. The food passes with different degrees of rapidity through the different parts of its course ; but most rapidly through the pharynx. The necessity of this is obvious, when we reflect that the air-tube must be closed while the food passes over it, and that the closure produces a temporary interruption to respiration. The progress of the food thi-ough the oesophagus is slow and gradual. DISSECTION OF THE LAEYNX. Before you commence the dissection of the larynx, make your- self familiar with the cartilages which compose it, and the ligaments which connect them. In other words, examine the frame-work of the larynx as seen in a dry preparation. Os-hyoides '^^^^ ^^^^^ ^^'^^ its resemblance to the Greek letter Upsilon, is situated between the larynx and the tongue, and serves for the attachment of the muscles of the tongue. It may be felt immediately below, and one inch and a half behind the symphysis of the jaw. Anatomists divide it into a body, two greater and two lesser cornua. The body is the thick central portion. Its anterior surface is convex, and marked by the attach- ment of muscles; its posterior concave surface corresponds to the epiglottis. The greatei^ cornua (right and left) project back- wards for about an inch and a. half, with a slight inclination upwards, and terminate in blunt ends tipped with cartilage. In young subjects they are connected to the body of the bone by fibro- cartilage; this in process of years becomes ossified. The lesser' cornua are connected, one on each side, to the point of junction between the body and the greater cornua, by means of a little joint lined by synovial membrane, which admits of free motion. They are not larger than a barley-corn, and the stylo-hyoid ligaments are attached to them.

DISSECTION OF THE UPPER AKM. 213 P 3 on the inner side is the ulnar vein; in the centre is the median, which divides into two branches; the external of which uniting with the radial to form the cephalic vein, is called the median cephalic; the internal, uniting with the ulnar to form the basilic, is named the median basilic. Near its bifurcation, the median vein communicates by a branch (mediana profunda) with the deep veins which accompany the arteries of the forearm. Trace the cephalic vein up the arm. It runs along the outer border of the biceps to the groove between the pectoralis major and the deltoid, where it terminates in the axillary. The basilic vein ascends along the inner side of the arm with the internal cutaneous nerve. Near the upper third of the arm, it per- forates the fascia, and empties itself either into the internal vena comes of the brachial artery or into the axillary vein. Eektion of nerves P^^^^^P^^ branches of the nerves pass beneath and veins at the the veins; but many small filaments cross in front which are exposed to injury in venesection. EeLation of median Since the median basilic vein is larger than the SSalSi;. f ^di-\««Pl^-lic, and, on account of the strong lascia beneath, more easily compressible, it is usually chosen for venesection: its position, therefore, in reference to the brachial artery, becomes very important. The vein is only separated from the artery by the fascia derived from the tendon of the biceps. This fascia is in some subjects remarkably thin, or even absent. It sometimes happens that the artery lies above the fascia, m absolute contact with the vein. In choosing, therefore this vein for venesection, there is a risk of wounding the toy' hence the practical rule, to bleed either from the median cephalic' f or from the median basilic above the situation where it crosses the brachial artery. af ^Tl V ^ "'^^y^^' ^neighbourhood • of the basihc vem, we find one or two small absorbent glands ' Others may lie higher up along the inner side of the arm.

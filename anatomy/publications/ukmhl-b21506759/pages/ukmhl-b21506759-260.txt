246 MUSCLES OF THE BACK CONNECTED WITH THE ARM. of the back to which they belong. Most of them are accompanied by small arteries. As might be expected, the external branches are the larger, especially in the loins, where some of them descend over the crest of the ilitim, and terminate in the skin of the buttock. Of these cutaneous nerves we need notice only the followmg : The posterior branch of the second cervical nerve is called the great occipital. It perforates the complexus, and ramifies upoii the scalp, with the branches of the occipital artery. The cutaneous branch of the third cervical nerve also supplies . the back of the scalp. The cutaneous branch of the second dorsal nerve is the largest of all the dorsi}.l cutaneous nerves. It may be traced outwards towards the spine of the scapula. The posterior branch of the second lumbar nerve perforates the fascia lumborum near the posterior superior spine of the ilium, and runs over the crest of the ilium to supply the skin of the buttock. Clean the trapezius and latissimus dorsi by dissectmg m the course of their fibres. i. ^ ^ -4. Taken alone this muscle is triangular, but with its Trapezius. ^^^^^^ presents a trapezoid form. It arises from the inner fourth, more or less, of the superior curved line of the occiput; from the ligamentum nuchse * and from the spmes of the seventh cervical, and all the dorsal vertebrae.^ The fibres con- verge towards the shoulder. The upper are ^nserted fleshy into the external third of the clavicle; the middle, into the mner border of the acromion and spine of the scapula ; the lower termi- nate in a thin tendon, which plays over the triangular surface at the back of the scapula, and is inserted into the beginning of the spine. The insertion of the trapezius exactly corresponds to the . The " ligamentum nuchee " is, in man, only a rudiment of the gi-eut el-tic Ugam^^^^^ which supports the weight of the head in quadx-upeds.

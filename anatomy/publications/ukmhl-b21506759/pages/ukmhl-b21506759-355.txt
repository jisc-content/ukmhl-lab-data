MALE PERINEUM. 341 z 3 is about equidistant from the anus and the bulb of the urethra, and serves for the fixation of muscular fibres from all quarters of the perineum. Thus you observe that the muscles of the perineum describe on each side a triangle, of which the sides are formed by the accele- rator urin^ and the crus penis respectively, and the base by the transversus perinei. Across this triangle run up from base to apex the superficial perineal vessels and nerves. Let us examine these before the muscles. Superficial The superficial perineal artery proceeds from the perineal internal pudic as it runs up the inner side of the tuber vessels and i"or>V,i"," t-l^ , , , nerves. ^l^ough we cannot see the main trunk, we can easily feel it by pressing the finger against the bone. I he artery comes into view a little above the level of the anus, and then passes up the perineal triangle, distributing branches to all the muscles, and is finally lost on the scrotum. The only named branch is a muscular one, called the transversalis perinei (p 342) This IS given off near the base of the triangle, and runs with the transversus perinei muscle towards the central point of the peri- neum It IS necessarily divided in the first incision in lithotomy and deserves attention, because it is sometimes of considerable S1Z6« d^l^^.^'^'^''^'°'^P'''^'^ veins, which are frequently dila ed and tortuous, especially in diseased conditions of the scrotum. of thelT" r'""''^ '^'"^ ^"'^^'^"^ P^^di^' course of theix corresponding arteries, and give off similar branches.

169 SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. of the fifth cerebral nerve. Proceeding from the Gasserian ganglion (fig. 37), it leaves the skull through the foramen rotun- dum, passes horizontally forwards across the spheno-maxillary fossa, enters the infra-orbital canal with the corresponding artery, and finally emerges upon the face through the infra-orbital foramen. The branches given off are — Pig. 37. Trunk of the fifth nerve . Gasserian gan- glion . . . Facial n. Chorda tyra- pani . , . Submaxillary ganglion Frontal, lacliry- mal, and nasal nn.

The orbital branch already described. ^ b. Branches to the spheno-palatine ganglion (Meckel's) situated in the spheno-maxillary fossa. c. One or two palatine nerves.—These descend throuo-h the spheno-palatine ganglion to the hard and soft palate. d. Posterior dental branches, two or three. They descend along the back part of the superior maxillary bone, Ll divide into smaller branches which pass through holes in the bone in company wath mmute arteries, and then run up the fangs of the molar teeth to supply the p.dp. They also supply the gums, and the hnmg membrane of the antrum.

By dividing the rectus transversely near the umbilicus, and raising it from its position, we have a complete view of the manner in which the sheath is formed; we observe, too, that this is very indistinct behind the lower fourth of the muscle. Eamifying in the substance of the muscle is a large artery, called the " epigastric," a branch of the external iliac ; also the continuation of the internal mammary, which descends from the subclavian. Nerves of the These nerves are the continuations of the six lower abdominal intercostal nerves, and of the first lunibar. Thev have the same general course and distribution. We trace them running forwards between the internal oblique and trans- versalis towards the rectus. They furnish branches to the abdo- minal muscles, and each gives off its lateral and anterior cutaneous branches described p. 286. Action of the consequence of their stratified arrangement, and m^Xs°^^ different direction of their fibres, the abdominal mus- cles answer many important purposes:—1. They are the principal muscles concerned in forcible expiration ; 2. By compress- ing the viscera in conjunction with the diaphragm, they are the chief agents in the expulsion of the f^ces and urine, also in vomit- ing, sneezing, laughing, coughing; 3. They act, each in its own way, as movers of the trunk: e. g. the right external obHque, co- operatmg with the left internal oblique, can draw the trunk towards the left side, and vice versa. The recti raise the body from the horizontal position, as any one may ascertain by laying the hand on the abdomen while rising from the ground. EXAMINATION OF THE PARTS CONCERNED IN INGUINAL HERNIA.

SPINAL CORD. 514 of septum between the two halves. Some of these septal fibres issuing from the anterior fissure wind round the sides of the medulla, and constitute what are termed the arciform fibres of the Fig. 125.

DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD. The proper mode of taking out the spinal cord is to saw through the arches of the vertebra. When these are removed, the spmal cord, covered by its membranes, is exposed. The first thing we notice is, that the cord does not occupy the whole area of the spmal canal. The dura mater does not adhere to the vertebrae, and is

DISSECTION OF THE TESTIS. 552 Testis '^^^ testicle is a gland of an oval shape, witli flattened sides, suspended obliquely, so tbat the upper end points forwards and outwards, the loAver end in the reverse direction. The left is generally a little the lower of the two, to obviate collision with its fellow. The ordinary weight of the gland is about six drachms; s Pig. 134. 1.

Epididymis. but few organs present greater variations in size and Weight, even in men of the same age: generally speaking, the left is the larger. Along the posterior part of the gland is placed a long narrow body, termed the " epididymis: " this is not a part of the testicle, but an appendage to it, formed by the convo- lutions of its long excretory duct. Its upper larger end is called the "globus major," and is connected to the testicle by the efferent ducts; the lower end, "globus minor," is only connected to the testicle by .fibrous tissue.

DISSECTION OF THE NOSE. 179 • Such a fold is sometimes so prominent that it might be mistaken during life for a polypus. The membrane varies in thickness and vascularity in different parts of the nasal cavities. Upon the lower half of the septum and the lower turbinated bones it is much thicker than elsewhere, in consequence of a minute plexus of arteries and veins in the submucous tissue. The veins are espe- cially numerous. Their sudden turgescence produces the temporary obsti-uction so common in an ordinary cold. In the sinuses, the mucous membrane is thinner, less vascular, and closely applied upon the periosteum. The great vascularity of the Schneiderian membrane is obviously mtended to elevate the temperature of the inspired air, and to poiu- out a copious secretion which answers the double pui-pose of partially saturating the air with vapour, and preventing the membrane from becoming too dry. Every one is aware that breathmg is performed more comfortably through the nose than through the mouth. Near the nostrils the mucous membrane is furnished with papillae and a scaly epithelium, like the skin. In the sinuses and all the lower regions of the nose, the epitheHum is columnar, and provided with ciha; but in the upper part of the nose, where the sense of smell resides, we no longer find ciUated epithelium, but a soft pulpy stratum of nucleated cells.* Blood-yes- arteries of the nose are, the ethmoidal and nasal interim of ""^^^ ^^'^ Ophthalmic, and the nasal branch of the the'nose° i^iternal maxillary, which enters the nose through the spheno-palatine foramen. The external nose is supplied by the arteria lateralis nasi. The veins of the nose correspond to the arteries. They commu- mcate with the veins within the cranium through foramina in the vem and the cavernous sinus. These communications explain the relief afforded by hemorrhage from the nose in cases of cexebi'l congestion. ^^-xeuidi * See Bo^vmun and Todd, Physiolog. Anatom, cap. xvi.

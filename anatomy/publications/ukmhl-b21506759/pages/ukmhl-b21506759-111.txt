PERICARDIUM. 97 He will find that he can, in a slight degree, alter the place and the extent of the impulse of the heart; and the reason is obvious. Inspiration and expiration also alter the position of the heart. In inspiration the heart descends with the tendinous centre of the diaphragm about half an inch. Perieaxdium. pericardium is the membranous bag which en- closes the heart and the large vessels at its base. It is attached below to the tendinous centre of the diaphragm; above, it is lost on the gi-eat vessels of the heart, and is connected with the cervical fascia. On each side it is covered by the plem-a. In front of it is the anterior mediastinum; behind it, the pos- terior. ^ Of all the objects in the posterior mediastinum, that which is nearest to the pericardium is the oesophagus. It is worth remembering that the oesophagus is in close contact with the back of the pericardium for nearly two inches; this fact accounts for what one sometimes observes in cases of pericarditis where there is much effusion; I mean pain and difficulty in swallowing. The pericardium is what is called a "fihro serous " membrane. Its fibrous layer, which constitutes the chief strength of it, is external. This layer, as just now stated, is attached below to the central tendon of the diaphragm. Above it forms eight sheaths for the vessels at the base of the heart; namely, one for'the vena cava superior, four for the pulmonary veins, two for the pul- monary arteries, and one for the aorta. The serous layer forms a shut sac. It lines the fibrous layer, and is reflected over the great vessels and the heart. The best way to see where the serous layer is reflected over the vessels, is to distend the pericardium with air. Thus you will find that this layer is reflected over the aorta as high as the origin of the arteria innominata. It is reflected over the vena cava superior, after the entrance of the vena azygos.* will rr.^ T^? ^^^^'^t^ons of the serous layer of the poricardiuffl

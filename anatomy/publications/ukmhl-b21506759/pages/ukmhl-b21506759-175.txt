DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. 161 the third, the fourth, the first division of the fifth, and the sixth, all of which pass through the sphenoidal fissure. The third supplies all the muscles with motor power, except the superior oblique, which is supplied by the fourth, and the external rectus which is supplied by the sixth. The ophthalmic division of the . fifth divides into a frontal, lachrymal, and nasal branch. The orbit contains, also, a considerable quantity of soft fat which forms a bed for the eye and prevents it from being pulled too far back by Its muscles. Upon the quantity of this fat depends, in some measure, the difference in the prominence of the eyes. Its absorp- tion m disease or old age occasions the sinking of the eyes. The eye is separated fi-om the fat by a fold of the orbital fascia, which, like a " tumca vaginalis," enables the globe to roll with the greatest rapidity and precision. Lastly, the orbit contains the lachrymal gland. ■ .1, ^^l^l '■^"""'^'^ periosteum, and the fascia of the orbit the following objects are seen.

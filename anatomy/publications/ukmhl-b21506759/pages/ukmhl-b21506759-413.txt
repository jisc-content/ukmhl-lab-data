Some say they commence by blind extremities; others by simple channels between the hepatic cells. Be this as it may, their radicles are surrounded by mi- nute cells, which are in fact the es- sential organs which secrete the bile. The interior of each lobule, that is, the space left between the several vessels, is filled by the " hepatic cells." These are nucleated, and have a mean diameter of about -^th of an inch. In some cases they contain fat glo- bules, and when these accumulate in large quantities, they constitute what is called a Â«fatty liver" The office of the cells is to separate the bile from the blood, in some way which we do not understand: when filled with bile they burst, and cUscharge themselves into the bile ducts. Such, in outline, is the minute anatomy of the liver. Eio-htly understood, we can have no difficulty in determining, in a section ot the organ, whether the portal or the hepatic venous system be congested.* The present views entertained concerning the functions of the liver may be thus briefly expressed.-l. It purifies the blood by excreting carbon and hydrogen, which, being subsequently re- absorbed, combine with oxygen, and thus help to keep up the heat ot the body. 2. It forms sugar which passes into the hepatic vems and being consumed in the process of respiration, helps to maintain ammal heat. 3. The bile assists in converting the chyme into chyle and reducing it into a state fit to be absorbed by the lacteals. 4. The bile acts as a slight natural aperient.

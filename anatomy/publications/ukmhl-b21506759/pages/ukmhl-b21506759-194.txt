IgQ MUSCLES OF THE BACK. The olfactory filaments, proceeding from each olfactory Olfactory anglion, in number about twenty on either side, pass through the foramina in the cribriform plate of the eth- moid bone. In its passage each filament is invested mth a coat derived from the dura mater; so that these filaments, although soft and easily torn within the skull, are, outside it, as firm as any other nerves. To make them more conspicuous, the bones should be steeped in dilute nitric acid. We divide them into an ^u7^er, a middle, and an outer set. The inner traverse the grooves on the upper part of the septum, and terminate in minute filaments be- tween the periosteum and the mucous membrane. They cannot Z traced bLv the upper half of the septum The ^ the roof of the nose. The outer pass through grooves m the upper and middle turbinated bones, and are lost m the mucous mem- brane on the convex surfaces of these bones.* The olfactory .re nerves of special sense. The common sen- sibmty of the mUus membrane of th e nose is supphed by branches f om the fifth pair of nerves; namely, the nasal branch of the ■ oph'h Imic (p. 160), and the nasal branch of the spheno-palatme .Con (p 169). That the sense of smell is mdependent of Sfclmon sens bility of the nose is proved by expenment and by pat'Sogy. For instance, any disease affecting the olfactory nLve evenle inflammation in a common cold, impan. the sense 7 men, whereas the common sensation of the pari, contmues equaUy acute, and becomes even more so, as one may readrly ascertain by introducing a foreign body into the nostril.

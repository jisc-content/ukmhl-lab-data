THE ABDOMEN. 284 THE DISSECTION OE THE ABDOMEN. ArHtrary ^® divide the abdomen into arbitrary regions, that division into the situation of the viscera contained in it may be more regions. easily described. For all practical purposes, the ancient division, handed down from the Greek authors, is sufficiently con- venient. An imaginary horizontal line is drawn across the abdomen on a level with the cartilage of the ninth rib; another on a level with the anterior spine of the ilium. That part of the cavity above the upper line is called the epigastric region ; that below the lower one, the hypogastric; while the space included between the liaes is termed the mesogastric or umbilical. These again are subdi- vided thus : — the sides of the epigastric region, beneath the costal cartilages, are termed respectively the right and left hypochondria, and the depression in front just below the en- siform cartilage, is called the scrobi- culus cordis, or the pit of the stomach. The sides of the umbilical region are named the ilia or flanks, and the back part, the loins. The sides of the hypo- gastric region are familiarly known as the groins, while the middle of it is called the pubes. An incision should be made from the sternum to the pubes, another from the anterior spine of the ilium to the umbilicus, and a third from the umbilicus obliquely outwards, over the cartilages of the ninth and tenth ribs, towards the axilla.

544 DISSECTION OV THE EAR, internal parts of the ear. For this purpose one end of the chain is attached to the membrana tympani, the other to the fenestra ovalis. At the back part of it is an opening for the passage of air into the mastoid cells. Lastly, a nerve, called the chorda tympani (a branch of the portio dura) runs across it. The membrana tympani completely closes the bottom Membrana ^ meatus auditorius. It is nearly circular, and its tympani. 4.1, + •+ • circumference is set in a bony groove, so tnat it is stretched somewhat like the parchment of a drum on the outer wall of the tympanum. Its plane is not vertical, but slants from above downwards, forming, with the lower part of the meatus, an angle of 45°: nor is it quite flat, but slightly conical, the apex being directed inwards towards the tympanum, and firmly united to the handle of the little bone called the " malleus." The struc- ture of the membrane is essentially fibrous; some of the fibres radiate from the centre, others are circular. Its inner surface is lined by mucous membrane; its outer surface is covered by an extremely thin layer of the true skin. This sufficiently accounts for the great sensibility of the membrane, and its vascularity when inflamed. For a complete account of the Eustachian tube see Enstachian jg-j,^ y^r^ ^ged only say here that it proceeds from the anterior part of the tympanum downwards and forwards to the pharynx.

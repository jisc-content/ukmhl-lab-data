The inner surface of the sclerotica is coated by a thm layer of areolar tissue impregnated with dark pigment cells. It is some- times called " lamina fusca." To examine the cornea, it should be removed with the sclerotic Hyaloid membrane Retina (dotted line) . Choroid coat (black line) Sclerotic coat . . . DIAGBAM OP A TBRTICAL SECTION OF THE EYE. 1.

This is best done under water, by making a circular cut with scissors about a quarter of an inch from the margin of the cornea. With a little care, it is easy to take off the outer covering of the eye without injuring the dark choroid coat underneath it, or the ciliary ligament, or the iris. In the loose watery cellular tissue between the sclerotic and the choroid we observe the ciliary nerves coming forwards towards the iris: their white colour makes them very conspicuous on the dark ground.

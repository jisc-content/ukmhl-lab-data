If you cannot find the posterior circumflex artery in its normal situa- tion, look for it (as a branch of the brachial) below the tendon of the teres major. Fig. 43.

Space for musculo-spiral n., and supe- rior profunda a. The posterior circumflex artery is accompanied by the Circumflex circumflex nerve which suppUes the deltoid. This large nerve comes from the posterior part of the brachial plexus, in common with the musculo-spiral, and after sending a bran h to the teres minor, terminates in the under -rface of the ddtdd. The nerve supplies, also, the skin covering the deltoid by bran hes, which turn round the posterior border of the muscle.

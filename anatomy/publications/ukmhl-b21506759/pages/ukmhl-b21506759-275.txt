DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE FOREARM. 261 a part of the lower end of the radius, which is not covered either by muscle or tendon. Tliis subcutaneous portion of the bone is immediately above the prominent tubercle in the middle of its lower extremity, and, since it can be easily felt through the skin, it pre- sents a convenient place for examination in doubtful cases of fractm'e. Extensor This muscle is partly covered by the supinator radii auSon'Jor. ^^^^^^^ of tlie ridge leading to the external condyle of the humerus, descends along the outer side of the forearm, and terminates about the middle, in a flat tendon, which passes beneath the extensor ossis metacarpi and primi internodii pollicis, traverses a groove on the outer and back part of the radius, lined by a synovial membrane, and is inserted into the carpal end of the metacarpal bone of the mdex finger. Previously to its insertion, the tendon is crossed by the extensor secundi internodii pollicis. Extensor This muscle arises from the external condyle. The carpi nidiaHs muscular fibres terminate near the middle of the fore- arm, upon the under surface of a flat tendon, which descends, covered by that of the extensor carpi radialis longior, beneath the first two extensors of the thumb. The tendon traverses a groove on the back of the radius, on the same plane with that of the long radial extensor, but lined by a separate synovial membrane and IS ^nserted into the carpal end of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. A bursa is generally found between the tendon and the bone. Extensor This muscle arises from the common tendon attached tSZ7s. ^? '^^^ fro^ the septa between it and _ the contiguous muscles, and from its strong fascial covering. About the middle of the forearm the muscle divides into three or four fleshy slips, terminating in as many flat tendons which, pass beneath the posterior annular ligament, throuah a !ZT r f f 1'^' ^^^^^ ^y^^^'-^l --brane. On the back of the hand they become broader and flatter, and diverge from each other towards the metacarpal joints of the fingers, where they become thicker and narrower, and give off on etch side a S3

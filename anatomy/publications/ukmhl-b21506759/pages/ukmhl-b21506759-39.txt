SUBMAXILLARY KEGION. 25 done, and underneatli it you will observe that tlie tendon of the digastricus makes two sides of a triangle, of which the base is formed by the hypoglossal nerve crossing the hyo-glossiis m. Within this little triangle, cut through the fibres of the hyoglossus, and under them is the lingual artery. The first time you perform this opera- tion on the dead subject, you will probably miss the artery and cut (through the middle constrictor) into the pharynx. Pursuing the dissection, reflect the anterior belly of the digas- tricus from its insertion into the jaw: reflect the mylo-hyoideus from the mesial line and the os-hyoides, and turn it over the body of the jaw. Thus we get at the parts which lie under the mylor hyoideus. To obtain a full view of them, however, it is necessary to saw through the symphysis of the jaw, so as to be able to separate the two halves of it, and draw the tongue out of the mouth. This done, we have to' make out the following objects, represented in fig. 5., p. 26.— 1. Genio-hyoideiis. 6. Sublingual gland. 2. Hyo-glossus. - 7. Hypoglossal nerve. 3. Stylo-glossus. 8. Gustatory nerve. 4. Genio-hyo-glossus. 9. Submaxillaiy ganglion. 6. Submaxillary duct. 10. Lingual aitery. The genio-hyoideus arises from the symphysis of the hyoideus. j'^"^' inserted into the front of the body of the os- hyoides. This round muscle is situated in the mesial line, and parallel to its fellow. Its nerve comes from the hypoglossal, and its blood from the lingual artery. Its action is to draw the os-hyoides for- wards and upwards. The hyo-glossus arises from the body and great cornu Hyo-glos- q£ ^i^g os-hyoides, and is inserted into the posterior two- thirds of the side of the tongue. This is a square and flat muscle; its fibres ascend nearly per- pendicularly from origin to insertion. Its nerve comes from the hypoglossal and its blood from the lingual artery. Its action (with that of its fellow) is to depress the tongue. Observe the several

3i0 rERITONEUM, Fig. 60. liver, forming its lateral ligaments; they separate to enclose the liver, meet again on its under surface, and pass on, under the name of gastro-hepatic omentum, to the smaller cm-ve of the sto- mach. Separating, they embrace the stomach, and meeting again at its greater curve, pass down over the small intestines to form the great omentum. At the lower margin, of the great omentum they are reflected upwards (so that the omentum consists of four layers) to the spine near the pancreas, and ,here the layers diverge from each other. The upper layer ascends in front of the pancreas to the diaphragm; the lower layer proceeds over the arch of the colon and then back to the spine, thus forming the transverse meso-colon.* From thence it is reflected over the small intestines, forming the me- sentery. From the root of the mesentery it descends into the pelvis, and invests a part of the rectum (and the uterus in the female). From the rectum it is reflected on to the posterior part of the bladder, and from thence to the wall of the abdomen, along which we trace it up to the dia- phragm. Such would be the course of the peritoneum as seen by a longi- DIAGEAM OF THE COUfiSE OF THE PEBITONEUM. (The aiTOWS show where the bladder can be tapped.) * This particular arrangement is demonstrable only in early life, grows the great omentum becomes adherent to the arch of the colon. As the child

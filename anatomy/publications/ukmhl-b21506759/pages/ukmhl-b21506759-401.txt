CONTENTS OF FEMALE PELVIS. 387 Uterus. -^^^ uterus is the receptacle which receives the ovum, retains it for nine months so as to bring it to maturity' and then expels it by virtue of its muscular walls. Enough has been already said at p. 383 of its situation and peritoneal connec- tions. We have now to notice that its axis slants forwards, so that upon the whole, the axis of the vagina and uterus describes a curve pretty nearly parallel to the axis of the pelvis. The uterus then IS so placed that it is ready to rise out of the pelvis into the ab- domen after the embryo has attained a certain size. The wisdom of this provision becomes manifest in cases where, from some acci:. dental cause, the natural direction of the uterus has been altered, so that, mstead of rising freely out of the pelvis, it becomes what IS called retroverted; that is, the large end is tilted backwards against he sacmm, while the apex presses forwards against the neck of the bladder. It need hardly be said that such a mal- position more or less obstructs the passage of both urine and faeces. Eespec ing the size and shape of the uterus in the unimpreg- nated state a better idea is conveyed by a single glance than by any description. Anatomists generally liken it to what a Bear would beif it were a little flattened ; in other words, itis triangu a Zll ir'r - -bout fhree \ ?S • at the upper pait; but there is variety in this respect, arising from age, the effe of pregnancies, and other causes. ^ ' ^""^^"^^^ For convenience of description, we divide the organ into the fim dus the body, and the cervix.

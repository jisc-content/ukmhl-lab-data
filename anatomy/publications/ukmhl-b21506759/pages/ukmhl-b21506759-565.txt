DISSECTION OF THE TESTIS. 551 ducts from the several lobes, from fifteen to twenty in number, converge towards the nipple, and, just before they reach it, become dilated into small sacs or reservoirs two or three Imes wide; after this they run up to the apex of the nipple, and termmate m separate orifices. . The arteries of the gland are derived from the long thoracic and internal mammary: the nerves come from the cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves. DISSECTION OF THE SCROTUM AND TESTIS. The scrotiim is composed of six tunics: â€” 1, The Srsc^oto 2, The tunica dartos; 3, A layer of cellular tissue; 4, The spermatic fascia derived from the ex- ternal abdominal ring; 5, The cremaster, or suspensory muscle; 6, The infundibuliform fascia derived from tbe internal ring. I do not mean to say that each of these coverings can be demon- strated under ordinary circumstances, because they are so blended together; but they can be shown in the case of old and large hernia when in a state of hypertrophy. The dartos is a thin layer consisting of muscular fibres Dartos. non-striped kind, like those of the bladder and intestines. Its use is to corrugate the loose and extensible skin of the scrotum, and in a measure to support and brace the testicle. Layer of Beneath the dartos is a large quantity of loose cellular ceUiilar tissue, remarkable for the total absence of fat. Together tissue. ^.^j^ ^j^g dartos, it forms a vertical partition between the testicles, termed " septum scroti" It is not a complete partition, since air or fluid will pass from one side to the other. The great abimdance and looseness of this tissue explains the enormous swelling of the scrotum in cases of anasarca, and in cases where the urine is effused into it in consequence of the urethra having given way. The cremaster muscle and infundibuliform fascia have been described (pp. 294, 298). M M 4

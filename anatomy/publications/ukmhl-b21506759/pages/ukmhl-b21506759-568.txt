These tie-beams (trabeeuli testis), as well as the mediastinum from which they proceed, are readily seen on making a transverse section through the gland (fig. 135). Kespecting the so-called Tunica vas- , . ° ^, . culosa. tunica vasculosa, nothmg more need be said than that it consists of a multitude of fine blood- vessels, formed by the ramifications of the spermatic artery, and held together by delicate cellular tissue. It lines the inner svirface of the tunica albuginea, and gives off vessels which run with the fibrous cords, into the interior of the gland. "When the testicle is cut into, its interior looks soft and pulpy, and of a reddish- grey colour. It consists of an innume- rable multitude of minute convoluted tubes (tubuli seminiferi). For conve- nience of package, they are arranged in lobules, between four and five hundred* in number, of various sizes, and contained in the compartments formed by the fibrous cords proceeding from the mediastinum testis. Only a few of these lobules are shown in diagi-am 135. Though disposed in lobules, still they communicate with each other, and thus form one vast network of tubes. The secretion from them is carried off by some forty or fifty straight vessels (vasa recta), which penetrate the mediastinum testis, and there form a plexus of seminal tubes, termed the " rete testis." This lies along the back of the gland. From the upper part of the rete the secretion is carried away to the large end of the epididymis by fifteen or twenty tubes, termed, « vasa efferentia." These, after formmga T-astnum- * This estimate is according to Ki-ause, Miiller's Archiv. fiir Anat. 1837. TEANSVEBSB SECTION. THEODGH THE TESTICLE. (Diagrammatic.) 1. Spermatic artery. 2.

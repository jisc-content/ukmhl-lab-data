Its form is pyramidal with the thickest part above; from thence it gradually tapers into the spinal cord. The anterior surface of the medulla oblongata presents a deep median fissure continuous with that of the cord (fig. 124). Below the pons Varolii this fissure terminates in a cul-de-sac, named the "foramen ccecum:" it is occupied by a Anterior aspect. Fig. 124. p. V. Pons Varolii. P. Anterior pyramid O. Olive. K.

On each side of the fissure there stand out in relief three longitudinal columns. The middle ones are called the " anterior 'pyramids.'" External to these are the " olives:' Still more external, and towards the posterior part of the medulla, are the " restiform tracts." The anterior pyramids, so called from their shape, are nan-ow below, but gi-adually increase in breadth as they ascend towards

SIDE VIEAV OF THE PELVIC VISCERA. 353 formed by the anterior ligaments of the bladder, its sides by the lateral ligaments * of the prostate, and its lower part by a hori- zontal layer of fascia interposed between the prostate and the rectum.f The use of this capsule is to fasten down the neck of the bladder and the prostate, and to maintain them in their proper position with regard to the pubic arch. But for this, the prostate would rise with the distending bladder, elongate the urethra, and thereby materially obstruct the free passage of the urine.f Genijeai '^^^ P^^^^*^ ^^^^^^^ so surrounded by veins and POSITION OP loose cellular tissue, that he who dissects them for the ™a m ^i^l ^eet with considerable difficulty in dis- THE luiE. covering their definite boundaries. The rectum runs at the back of the pelvis. The bladder lies in front of the rectum, immediately behind the symphysis pubis. At the neck of the bladder is the prostate gland through which the urethra passes. In the celluW tissue, between the bladder and the rectum, there is, on each side, a convoluted tube called the "vesicula seminalis"; and on the inner side of each vesicula is the seminal duct or vas deferens. Before we describe these several parts in detail, it is necessary to say a few words about the lar^e tortuous veins by which they are surrounded.

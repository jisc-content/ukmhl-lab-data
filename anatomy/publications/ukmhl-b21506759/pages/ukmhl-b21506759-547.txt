The arteries ramify on the inner surface of the choroid: they perforate the sclerotica near the optic nerve, and then divide and subdivide into a very minute network, termed after the Dutch anatomist Euysch, " tunica Ruyschiaoia." Posteriorly there is a circular aperture in the choroid for the passage of the optic nerve. In front the choroid is united to the ciliary ligament: it appears to stop short here; but this is not the M M 3

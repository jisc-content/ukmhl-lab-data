In speaking or singing, the glottis assumes what is called the vocalizing position—that is, the opening be- comes narrower and its edges nearly parallel.

The four pairs are—the crico-thyroidei, the crico-aryte- noidei postici, the crico-arytenoidei laterales, and the thyro-aryte- noidei. The single one is the arytenoideus.

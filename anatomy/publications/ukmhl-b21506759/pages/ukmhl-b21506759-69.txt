STRUCTURE OF THE EYELIDS. 55 junction of the eyelids. When the caruncle is diminished in size by disease, the puncta lacrymalia become displaced, and the tears are apt to run down the cheek. The conjimctival coat of the eyelid will be described with the anatomy of the eye. We merely observe at present, that it is more vascular than the conjunctival coat of the eye, and that it presents a number of minute papillae, which, when enlarged and aggregated by inflammation, give rise to the disease called "granular lids." Such, in outhne,^ is the structure of the eyelids. Their use is best described by Socrates, who, in answer to the question whether animals were made by chance or design, replies: — " Think you not that it looks like the work of prescience, because the sight is delicate, to have guai-ded it with eyelids, which open when we want to see, but shut when we go to sleep; to have fenced these lids with eyelashes, which, like a sieve, strain the dusty wind, and hinder it from hurting the eyes; and over the eyes to have placed eyebrows, as eaves, to carry off the sweat of the brow from distm'b- ing the sight ?

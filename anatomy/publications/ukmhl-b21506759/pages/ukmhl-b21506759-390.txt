3V6 ANATOMY OF Tllic PENIS. Anteriorly, each terminates in a rounded end which is received into a corresponding depression in the glans, which fits on to them like a cap. If a longitudinal section be made through the corpus caver- nosum, we observe that its interior is composed of a delicate reticular structure, surrounded by a thick fibrous coat. This coat 1.

Moreover, this coat forms a longitudinal partition, dividing the corpus cavernosum into two lateral halves. The partition, however, is only complete near the root of the perns; along the rest of the organ there are a number of gaps m it, so that it has somewhat the appearance of a comb ; for this reason it has been called the « septum pectiniforme:' Through this par- tition the blood vessels on one side communicate freely with those on the other: therefore both sides of the penis become erect simul- taneously. * And now let us examine the construction of the erectile, spongy- looking tissue inside. The interior of the cylinder is occupied by a number of deUcate elastic thread-like septa, which intersect each other in all directions, so as to form a multitude of minute cells. These communicate most freely with each other, as one may readily ascertain by blowing air into the penis. They are not of equal • size throughout the penis, for they are much smaller, and their

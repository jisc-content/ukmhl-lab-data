216 DISSECTION or THE UPPER AKM. This thin muscle is situated at the upper part of the ^'"''\^?-r arm, and runs parallel to the inner border of the short brachials. ^^^^ ^.^^^^^ ^^^.^^^ ^^^^^ ^^^^^ ^^^^ point of the coracoid process, in common with the short head of the biceps, and from a fibrous septum which lies between them- The muscle terminates in a flat tendon, which is mserted mto the inner side of the middle of the humerus, between the brachiahs anticus and the inner head of the triceps. Its action is to draw the humerus forwards and inwards, e. g. in bringing the gun up to the shoulder. , , 4. 1 Concerning the coraco-brachialis remember, 1. that the external cutaneous nerve runs through it; 2. that its inner fleshy border is the guide to the axillary artery in the last part of its course; 3. that the brachial artery lies upon its flat tendon of insertion, and can here be effectually compressed by the finger or the tourmquet^ The coraco-brachialis and biceps are covered at their upper part by the deltoid and pectoralis major. The head of the humerus rolls beneath the coraco-brachialis and short origm of the biceps ; and a large 6ursa is interposed between these muscles and the tendon of the subscapularis, which covers the head of the bone This muscle is situated close to the lower half oi the BracldaHs j^^^ierus, and is partially concealed by the biceps. Between the two muscles you will find the external cutaneous nerve, which supplies them both. It arises from the humerus by a fleshy digitation ob either side the tendon of the deltoid, from the front sm-face 0f 1- W below this point, and from the intermuscular -P^^ J^.^ f becoming thicker and broader as it descends, covers the fion of the caWe of the elbow-joint, and terminates in a tendon which is jrL/in a pointed manner into the coronoid process of the ulna.

28 SUBMAXILLARY REGION. The ducts of the sublingual gland (ducts of Eivinus*) vary in number from seven to twelve. They terminate by minute open- in6;s behind the orifice of the submaxillary duct, along a ridge upon the floor of the mouth. The ducts of some of the lobes terminate in the submaxillary duct. The duct of the submaxillary gland may now be traced across the hyo-glossus, and under the gustatory nerve to the floor of the mouth. This nerve is a branch of the inferior maxillary, or ner've ^"'^ third division of the fifth pair. It descends between the ramus of the jaw and the internal pterygoid muscle, and comes forwards along the upper part of the hyo-glossus, crossing at an 'acute angle over the duct of the submaxillary gland. Having reached the under part of the tongue, the nerve divides into filaments which supply the papillae on its anterior three- fourths. Look at the lower border of the gustatory nerve Submaxillary j^gfoj-g it crosses the Submaxillary duct, and you will ganguon. j :> j find a small ganglion, about the size of a pin's head. Like the other ganglia in connnection with the branches of the fifth pair, it receives nerve-filaments of three difi'erent kinds, viz. motor, sensitive, and sympathetic. Its motor root is the chorda tympani, which, though apparently a branch of the gustatory, is in point of fact derived from the facial nerve (a nerve of motion). Its sensitive roots proceed from the gustatory; and its connection with the sympathetic system of nerves is established by a branch which comes from the " nervi molles " round the facial artery. Thus provided with nerves from these sources, the gang- lion supplies the submaxillary and sublingual glands and their ducts. The lingual artery is generally the second branch Lmgual ar- external carotid. Curving slightly upwards from its origin, the artery soon rtms forwards beneath the hyo-glossus muscle, parallel to the ps-hyoides. At the anterior * Aug. Quirin. Eivinus, de Dyspepsia. Lips. 1678.

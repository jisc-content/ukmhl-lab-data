Three other dilatations (the sinuses of Valsalva), one corresponding to each of the valves at the commencement of the aorta, will be exammed * hereafter. _ r ^.^ ^ These relations vary according to the size ot the Heart, StlSrof the obliquity of the ribs, and the general development theaorta°to o{*the chest.

From the upper part of the arch arise three great arteries for the head, neck, and upper limbs; namely, the brachio-cephahc or innominate artery, the left carotid, and the left subclavian.

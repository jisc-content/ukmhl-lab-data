242 DISSECTION OF THE PALM OF THE HAND. These four slender muscles, one for each finger, are Xumbrlcalcs. ^^^^^^-^^^ ^o the deep flexor tendons in the palm. All of them arise from the radial side of the deep tendon of their corre- sponding finger: the third and fourth often arise from the adjacent sides of two tendons. Each terminates in a broad thin tendon which passes over the radial side of the first joint of the finger, and is inserted into the extensor tendon on the back of the finger. Their action is to bend the first joint of the fingers. Being inserted near the centre of motion, they can move the fingers with ^ great rapidity. As they produce the quick motions of the musician's fingers, they are called by anatomists " fidicinales." uscles of strength of the muscles of the ball of the the ball of thumb (unde nomen pollicis),,is one of the distinguishing the thimb. ^.]^aracters of the human hand. This strength is neces- sary in order to oppose that of all the fingers. In addition to its strength, the thumb enjoys perfect mobility. It has no less than eight muscles to work it: —namely, an abductor, an opponens, two flexors, three extensors, and an adductor. Take first the muscles of the ball. This is the most superficial of the muscles of the ball. Abductor arises from the os scaphoides and annular ligament; and is inserted by a flat tendon into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. Its action is to draw the thumb away^ from the fingers. Eeflect it from its insertion to expose the foUowmg— This muscle arises from the os trapezium and the Flexor ossis ^^^^^^^ ligament, and is inserted into the whole length of poSr the metacarpal bone of the thumb. The action of this opponens. ^^^^^.f^^ ^^^g^le is to oppose the thumb to all the fingers. Eeflect it from its insertion to expose the following — This muscle has two origins; one from the annular Flexor brevis ligament and os trapezium, the other from the os trapezoides, os magnum, and the upper end of the wist joint. It communicates always with the synovial sheath of the long flexor of . r humb, in most cases with that of the flexors of the little finger, and but rardy with that ;f the index, middle, and ring fingers. On tins accoxmt^inflammat.on of^e theca of the thxm.b or little finger is more liable to be attended with serious conse- quences than either of the others.

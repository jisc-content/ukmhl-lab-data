468 SOLE OF THE FOOT. Fig. 103. the metatarsal bones, and inosculates with the anterior tibial in the first interosseous space. In the first part of its course, it lies between the flexor brevis digitorum and the flexor accessorius; in the second it lies very deep beneath the flexor tendons, and the ad- ductor pollicis, close to the metatarsal bones. Deeply seated as it appears to be, a part of its curve near the fifth metatarsal bone lies immediately beneath the fascia. Here it might be more easily tied than in any other part of its course. Its chief branches are the four digital ar- teries, which arise in the arched part of its course. Theyf supply both sides of the fifth, fourth, third, and the outer side of the second toe ; the great toe, and the inside of the se- cond, being supplied by the dorsalis hallucis. Concerning the distribution of the digital ar- teries, refer to the account given of these arteries in the hand; they are in all respects similar (p. 236). Besides the digital arteries, the arch gives off small branches, which ascend between the metatarsal bones and inosculate with the dorsal interosseous arteries. The posterior tibial nerve divides, like the artery, Plantae -^^(^ external and internal plantar. The internal plantar is generally the larger, and supplies nerves to three toes and a half, like the median nerve in the palm. It also supplies the muscles on the inner side of the sole, the flexor brevis digitorum and the two inner lumbricales. The external plantar supplies nerves to the fifth toe and the outer side of the fourth, like the ulnar in the palm. Besides these, it furnishes nerves to the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti, the two outer lumbri- cales, the flexor accessorius, and a considerable branch which ac- companies the plantar arch for the supply of the adductor pollicis the transversalis pedis, and all the interossei. 1.

453 DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE THIGH. The incision should be continued down the back of the thigh, the ham, and half way down the calf. The skin should be reflected on either side. Cutaneous '^^^ hack of the thigh is supplied by the nerves and lesser ischiatic nerve, which runs down beneath the fascia, as low as the upper third of the calf, distributing branches on either side. There are no subcutaneous veins of any size at the back of the thigh; for here they would be liable to pressure. But near the ham we find a vein, called the " external saphena." It ascends up the back of the calf, and joins the popliteal vein. Eespecting this, there is nothing to be remarked more £a!^^^ ^^^^ fibres run chiefly in a transverse direction, that it becomes stronger as it passes over the popliteal space, and that here it is connected with the tendons on either side. Eemove it, in order to examine the powerful muscles which bend the leg, called the "hamstrings." • . There are three of these, and all arise by strong mSes. ^ tendons from the tuber ischii. One, the biceps, is inserted into the head of the fibula; while the other two, namely the semitendinosus and semimembranosus, are in- serted into the tibia. The divergence of these muscles towards their respective insertions occasions the well-known space termed the "ham," which is occupied by soft fat, and the popliteal vessels and nerves. Biceps. "^^^^ muscle, as implied by its name, has two origins, a long and a short. The long one takes place, by means of a strong tendon, from the back part of the tuber ischii; the short one, by fleshy fibres, from the Unea aspera of the femur. This, which we can easily see by dissecting on the outside of the thigh, begins at the linea aspera, just below the insertion of the glutaeus maximus, and continues nearly down to the external con-

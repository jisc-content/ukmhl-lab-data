DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. 162 upper eyelid. Its branches within the orbit are — 1, filaments to the lachrymal gland; 2, a malar, which traverses a canal in the malar bone, and supplies the skin of the cheek; 3, one or two nerves which pass down to communicate with the superior maxil- lary division of the fifth. This nerve enters the orbit above the other nerves ne^s'°' which pass through the sphenoidal fissure. It runs patheticus. (ji^ectly to the orbital surface of the superior obHque, to which it is exclusively distributed. This gland is situated within the external angular Lachrymal process of the frontal bone. It is about the size and ^^''''^ shape of an almond. Its upper surface is convex, in adaptation to the roof of the orbit; its lower is concave, in adaptation to the eyeball. The anterior part of the gland bes sometimes detached from the rest, close to the back part of the upper eyelid, and is covered by the conjunctiva. The whole Xd is kept in place by a capsule* formed by the fascia of the orbit. In structure it resembles the salivary glands. It consists of an aggregation of small lobes composed of smaller lobules, connected by areolar tissue. The excretory ducts, seven to ten in number, run parallel, and perforate the conjunctiva about a quarter of an inch above the edge of the tarsal cartilage (fig. 35). They are not easily discovered in the hu- man eye, but in that of the horse or bullock they are large enough to admit a smaU probe. The secretion of the gland keeps the surface of the cornea constantly moist and polished. But if dust, or any foreign substance, irritate the eye, the tears flow in abundance, and wash it off. * This capsule, heuig a little Stronger on the under surface of the gaud, is described and figured by Soemmerring as a distinct ligament; " Icones Oeuli Humani, tab. vu.

366 STRUCTURE OP THE BLADDER AND PROSTATE. filaments of the sympathetic do not stop at the prostate, but pass on beneath the pubic arch into the corpus cavernosum penis. Thus the erectile tissue of the intromittent organ is brought di- rectly within the influence of the sympathetic system. STRUCTURE OP THE BLADDER, PROSTATE, URETHRA, AND PENIS. . The parts are presumed to have been collectively taken out from the pelvis, and the partial peritoneal covering of the bladder to have been removed. The bladder is composed of a partial peritoneal coat, a omt" muscular and a mucous ; these are connected by an inter- Uadder. ^^gdiate layer of cellular tissue, out of which some anato- mists make a third coat, and call it the cellular. The muscular is the outside coat. It consists of bundles ot muscular fibres crossing each other in various directions Then colour and development depend upon whether the individual ha. suffered from irritation of the bladder, or any obstruction to the flow of the ui-ine. The general direction of the fibres is as follows: -An outer layer arises from the circumference of the prostate, and from thence its fibres spread out longitudinally over the bladder. Under this is a layer of circular fibres, more especially near the neck. Towards the sides of the bladder the two sets f fibres have a less definite arrangement, and form a kind of net- work: these, therefore, are the weakest parts of the bladder, and more liable to the formation of pouches.* r .

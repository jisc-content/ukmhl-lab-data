SPINAL CORD. 521 vertebral, intercostal, and lumbar arteries : 2, the posterior spinal arteries, wbicb proceed also from the vertebral, intercostal, and lumbar ai-teries, and ramify very irregularly on the back of the cord. It is curious that, on the posterior part of the bodies of the vertebra} the spinal arteries of opposite sides form by their mutual communications a perfect arterial " ladder " down the entire length of the spinal column.* We noticed a similar arrangement of the venous " sinuses " of the spine, p. 515. ^ ^ The anterior columns consist exclusively of motor Functions oi r i the colvmms fibres which originate from the grey matter ot the bram of the cord. ^^^^ ^j^g gp-^^^ gQrd, and carry the commands of the will and the power of reflex movement to the muscles. The posterior columns consist exclusively of sensitive fibres, which carry sensations, not, as was formerly believed, direct to the brain, but to the grey matter of the cord, through which alone, according to the recent experiments of Brown Sequardf, they are transmitted to the brain. The same experimentalist has also proved another unexpected fact;—that sensations do not run up on the same side but on the opposite. They cross in the cord; for instance if the posterior column on the right side were injured, the left leg and not the right would be deprived of feeling. These are among the most complicate parts of the centralnervous system. They contain white and OBLONGATA AND gj-ej mattor $, intermixed.

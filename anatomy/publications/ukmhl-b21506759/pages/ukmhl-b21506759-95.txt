SYMPATHETIC NERVE IN THE NECK. 81 is connected with all the spinal nerves. Its upper or cephalic ex- ti-emity penetrates into the cranium through the carotid canal, sur- rounds the internal carotid artery, communicates with the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cranial nerves, and is said to join its fellow of the opposite side upon the anterior communicating artery.* Its sacral extremity joins its fellow by means of a little " ganglion impar," situated in the mesial line, upon the last sacral vertebra. The sympathetic system of nerves presides over the functions of those organs which are withdrawn from our control. Thus it regidates the circulation of the blood, respiration, digestion, and secretion; all of which processes go on without our being conscious of them. Cervical gan- Cervical portion of the sympathetic are three gKa of sym- ganglia, named from their position, superior, middle pattetie. and inferior. The superior cervical ganglion, the largest of the three, is situated near the base of the skull, upon the rectus capitis anticus major behind the internal carotid artery. It is of a reddish-grey colour Hke other ganglia, of an elongated oval shape, varying in length from one to two inches. It may facilitate the description of its several branches if we divide them into — 1st, those which are presumed to connect it with other nerves; and 2ndly, those which originate from it. It is then connected by branches as follows : a. With each of the four upper spinal nerves. 6. With the hypoglossal, pneumogastric, and glosso-pharyno-eal nerves. ° c. With the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cerebral nerves (in the cavernous sinus). d. With the several ganglia of the sympathetic system about the head and neck; namely, the ophthalmic, spheno-palatine, otic and siibmaxillary. ' The branches which it distributes are — e. Nerves to the heart.-One or more descend behind the » Here, it is said, is situated the Httle gangHon of Eibes. I have never seen it Gt

359 SIDE VIEW OF THE PEJ.VIC VISCERA. Vesicul These are situated, one on either side, between the senSes. ladder and the rectum (fig. 68, p. 336). Strictly speaking each is a tube, but so convoluted that it looks inore like a little sacculated bladder. When rolled up, the tube is not more than two and a half inches long, but when unravelled it is more than twice that length, and about the size of a small writing quill. Several blind tubes, or csecal prolongations, proceed from the main one, after the manner of a stag's horn. The vesiculte seminales do not run parallel, but they diverge from each other posteriorly like the branches of the letter V, and each lies immediately on the outer side of the vas deferens into which it leads. The function of the vesicul^ seminales is to serve as reservoirs for the semen. If one of them be opened a brownish-coloured fluid escapes trom It. This is presumed to be in some way accessory to the lunction of generation.* Prostate P^ostate gland is situated at the neck of the gland. bladder, and surrounds the first part of the urethra (p. 336). In the healthy adult it is about the size and shape of a chestnut. Its apex is directed forwards. It is sur- rounded by a plexus of veins (p. 353), and is maintained in its position by the pelvic fascia (p. 351). Its upper surface is about three-quarters of an inch below the symphysis pubis. The apex of the prostate is about one and a half inches from the anus : the base IS about two and a half. So much for the situation of the prostate. Now for its rela^ t^ns Above It we have the anterior ligaments of the bladder with the dorsal vem of the penis between them; below, and contact with it, is the rectum; on each side of it is the levator , m front of It we have the membranous part of the urethra (sur- rounded by its compressor muscle), and the triangular ligament • behind are the neck of the bladder and the vesfcula. setral s' with the ejaculatory ducts. . ^tju^maies course it may be seen, througli the peritoneum, crossimr-1 tlm „vf i -r 2, the rem^s of the umbilical arte^; 3, the oU^Z'J:^!!^:^:^'^ ""f^ * The yesiculse seminales are but imperfectly deyelonerl Z T J ' ^^'^'^^^r. .

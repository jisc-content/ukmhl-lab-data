ELBOW-JOINT. 275 mentous collar, called the annular ligament, within whicli it freely rolls. Intei^ial lateral ligament — This is triangular. Its apex is attached to the internal condyle of the humerus : from this point the fibres radiate, and are inserted into the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna. A transverse band of ligamentous fibres extends from the ole- cranon to the coronoid process, across a notch observable on the inner side of the sigmoid cavity: through this notch vessels pass into the joint. External lateral ligament. —This is attached to the external condyle of the humerus ; the fibres spread out as they descend, and are interwoven with the annular ligament, surrounding the head of the radius.

LIGAMENTS OF THE ELBOW. _ The orhcular or annular ligament of the radius (fio- 51) IS attached to the anterior and the posterior border of the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna. With this cavity, it forms a compi; collar, which encircles the head and part of the neck of the radius T 55

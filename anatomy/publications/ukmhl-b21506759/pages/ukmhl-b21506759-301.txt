287 ABDOMINAL MUSCLES. a. The lateral cutaneous nerves come out between the digita- tions of the external oblique muscle, in company with small arteries, and divide into anterior and posterior branches. Observe, however, that the lateral branch of the twelfth dorsal nerve is larger than the others, and that it passes over the crest of the ilium to the skin of the buttock. The corresponding branch of the fii-st lumbar nerve has a similar distribution. h. The anterior cutaneous nerves come with little arteries through the sheath of the rectus muscle. They are not only smaller than the lateral nerves, but their number and place of exit is less regular. That which comes through the external abdominal ring, (ilio-inguinal) as well as another which comes through the wall of the abdomen just above it, (ilio-hypogastric) is derived from the first lumbar nerve. These, however, are but repetitions of the others, and supply the skin of the groin and scrotum in the male, and the labium pudendi in the female,* Muscles of -^^^^ examine the abdominal muscles.

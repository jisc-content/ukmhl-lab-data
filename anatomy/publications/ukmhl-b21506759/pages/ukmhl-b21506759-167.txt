DISSECTION OF THE SCALP. 153 hard to give a description; one cannot be surprised at this, con- sidering the various and rapid motions of the organ. If we trace the genio-hyo-glossi of opposite sides into the tongue, we find that some of their fibres ascend directly to the surface; others cross each other in the middle line, intersect the longitudinal fibres, and finally terminate upon the sides of the tongue. Lastly, the fibres of the stylo-glossus may be traced along the side of the tongue to the apex. In the mesial line near the base of the tongue is found a vertical plane of fibrous tissue, connected behind to the body of the hyoid bone, and lost in front between the muscles. This so-caHed "nudeiLsfihrosus linguce" is a feeble representative of the lingual bone m some of the lower animals. The nerves supplying the tongue should be followed into its substance. The hypoglossal nerve supplies all the muscles with motor power. The gustatory or lingual branch of the fifth pair is distributed to the mucous membrane about the apex and sides of the tongue, and endows it with most acute sensibility. Upon this nerve depends the sensation of all ordinary impressions, such as that of hardness, softness, heat, cold, and the like. The glosso- pharyngeal nerve suppHes the mucous membrane at the back and sides of the tongue. It is especiaUy a nerve of taste. DISSECTION OF THE SCALP. An incision should be made from the nose along the mesial line to the occiput; another at right angles to the first from one side of the head to the other.

476 LIGAMENTS OF THE KNEE. Crucial. this bone.* The use of it is to allow the free play of the bone over the lower part of the femur. The fold extends higher above the inner than the outer condyle : this accounts for the form of the swelling produced by effusion into the joint. Folds of Below the patella a slender band of the synovial synovial membrane proceeds backwards to the space between the mem lane.

Immediately outside the synovial membrane there is always more or less fat: this is especially accumulated under the Uga- mentum patellse. Its use is obviously to fill up vacuities, and to mould itself to the several movements of the joint. The crucial ligaments, so named because they cross like the letter X, extend from the mesial side of each con- dyle to the head of the tibia. The anterior, a, b, passes from the outer coudyle forwards to the fossa in front of the spine of the tibia. The posterior, c, d, is best seen from behind: it goes from the inner condyle backwards to the fossa behind the spine of the tibia. , Between the condyles and the Inter-articular or semilunar articular surfaces of the tibia there cartHages. incomplete rings of fibro- cartilage, shaped like the letter C. They an- swer many purposes. They deepen the articular surfaces of the tibia; their mobility and elasticity enable them to adapt themselves to the con- dyles in the several movements of the joint; they distribute pressure over a greater surface, upon the principle that a porter places a knot Fig. 107. a b.

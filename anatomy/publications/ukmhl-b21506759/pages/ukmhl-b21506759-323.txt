PERITOKEUM. 309 X 3 and crumpled. Now and then it is found riddled with holes. This last state of parts is attended with some risk, for it may- happen that a knuckle of intestine becomes strangulated in one of the holes; and of this, death is the almost certain result. Gastro "^^^^ ^^^'^ connects the stomach to the liver. Its hepatic or right border is free; and between its layers are the lesser omen- yessels and nerves going to, and the duct coming from, the liver. The duct lies to the right, the hepatic artery to the left, and the vena portse behind and between them. If the finger be introduced beneath this border, it passes through what is called the "foramen of Winslow " * into the lesser cavity of the peritoneum (p. 316). This foramen is situated behind the right edge of wSw ^^^^^'^ omentum. Very often it is blocked up by adhesions. But if you can get your finger in, you will find that the foramen is bounded above, by the liver; below, by the commencement of the duodenum; in front, by the free border of the lesser omentum; behind, by the vena cava inferior. Gastro- ^^^^ ^^^^ proceeds from the great end of the stomach splenic to the spleen, and is continuous below with the great omentum. It contains between its layers the "vasa brevia," branches from the splenic artery to the great end of the stomach. Course of '^^''^ trace the peritoneum, as a continuous the peri- membrane. To say the truth, this is not a very easy matter, — in fact, it has always been considered a sort of anatomical puzzle. Since the peritoneum is a perfect sac, it matters not where we begin, for after all we must come back to the point from which we started. Supposing, then, a longitudinal section were made through, the viscera in the middle Hue of the body, one might trace the peritoneum thus — beginning at the diaphragm, and taking, for brevity's sake, two layers at a time (fig. 60):- From the diaphragm two layers of peritoneum proceed to the * Fatal strangulation of a portion of intestine has been known to take place in this foramen.

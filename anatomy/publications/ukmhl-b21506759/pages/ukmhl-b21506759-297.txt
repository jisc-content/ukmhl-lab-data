283 JOINTS OF THE FINGEES. The glenoid ligaments have a surgical importance for the follow- ing reason: â€” In dislocation of the fingers, the facility of reduction mainly depends upon the extent to which the glenoid ligament is injured. If it be much torn there is but little difficulty: if entire the reduction is extremely tedious and sometimes impracticable. These joints are secured on their dorsal aspect by the passage of the extensor tendon, and the expansion proceeding from it on either side. Their synovial membranes are loose, especially beneath the extensor tendons. Second and '^^^ corresponding articular surfaces of the phalanges LAST JOINT of the finger and thumb are so shaped as to form a ^G^s. binge-joint, and, therefore, incapable of lateral move- ment. The ligaments connecting them are similar in every respect to those between the metacarpal bones and the first phalanges. The glenoid Hgament of the last joint of the thumb generally contains a sesamoid bone.

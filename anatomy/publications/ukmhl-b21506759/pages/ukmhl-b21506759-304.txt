The front of the sheath comprises the aponeurosis of the ex- ternal oblique, and half the thickness of that of the internal oblique*; while the back of the . sheath comprises the aponeurosis of the trans- versalis, and the other half of the internal oblique (fig. 55).

This is the "linea alba:" it is but a continuation of the sternum deprived of its earthy matter, in adaptation to the functions of this part of the body. A little below the middle of it is situated what was in the foetus the opening of the passage of the umbilical vessels. After birth, the vessels being no longer required, the opening gradually closes, and becomes plugged by their fibrous remains. _ Since the linea alba is the thinnest paxt of the abdomen, and is free from blood-vessels, it is chosen as a safe line for tapping m dropsy, and for puncturing the bladder in retention of urme.

It arises from the upper part of the pubes in front of the rectus, and terminates in the Hnea alba about midway between the pubes and the umbilicus. It is said to be of use in tightening the hnea alba, * The line where the internal obHque splits-namely, along the ont*r border of the rectus is called the linea semilmaris.

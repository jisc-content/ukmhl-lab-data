483 1 I 2 THE DISSECTION OF THE BEAIN. The most convenient manner of removing the brain is to cut through the scalp, from one ear to the other, so that the anterior part of the scalp may be detached from the skull and pulled down over the face; the posterior, over the back of the head. The skull- cap should then be taken off about half an inch above the supra- orbital ridges. It is better to saw only through the outer table of the skull, and to break through the inner with a chisel. In this way, the dura mater and the brain are less likely to be injured. Three mem- Previous to the examination of the brain itself you branes of should study the structure and uses of the three mem- the bram. 'bpanes by which it is surrounded, â€” namely, a tough fibrous membrane termed the " dura mater " ; a serous membrane termed the "arachnoid"; and a very vascular membrane termed the " pia mater." This is the first membrane exposed after the re- moval of the skull-cap. It is so called from the notion that it gave rise to all the other membranes in the body. Its re- markably tough and fibrous structure adapts it exceedingly well to the four purposes which it serves : 1, it forms the internal perios- teum of the skull; 2, it forms, for the support of the lobes of the brain, three partitions, namely the falx cerebri, the falx cerebelli, the tentorium cerebelli: 3, it forms the sinuses or venous canals which return the blood from the brain : 4, it forms sheaths for the nerves as they leave the skull. These arteries ramify between the dura mater and ^erksf'^^ Their course may be traced l)y the grooves which they make in the bones. The most important is the " drteria meningea media," a branch of the internal maxillary

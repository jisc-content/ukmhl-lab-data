42 BKANCHES OF THE SUBCLAVIAN. Under sucli circumstances one cannot be surprised that even distinguished anatomists have committed mistakes. Sir Astley Cooper* failed in one instance. Dupuytren perforated the artery with the point of the needle, and included one of the nerves in the ligature : fatal haemorrhage was the result.f I '^as present at an operation in which the large nerve (a branch of the brachial plexus) which runs parallel with and on a plane anterior to the artery was mistaken for it and tied; the surgeon being deceived by the pulsation communicated to the nerve. The branches of the subclavian extend so far, that in fhe subda-^ the present dissection we can trace them only for a short •vian artery, distance. They are four in number : — 1. The vertebral. 2. The thyroid axis, which gives off inferior thyroid, supra- scapular, posterior-scapular, and cervicalis ascendens. 3. The internal mammary. 4. The superior intercostal, which gives off the deep cervical. The rule is, that these branches arise from the subclavian in the first part of its course. The most frequent variety is, that the posterior scapular (transversalis colli) arises from the subclavian m the third part of its course.$ This, the first and largest branch, arises fi-om the upper Vertebral part of the subclavian. For a short distance it lies in the arteiy. j^^erval between the scalenus anticus and the longus colli Here it enters the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, and ascends through the foramina m the transverse processes of the succeeding vertebra. In the interval between the axis and the atlas, recollect that the artery makes a sigmoid curve, in order that it may not be stretched in the rotation * London Medical Eeview, vol. ii. p. 300. t Edinburgh Med. and Surg.

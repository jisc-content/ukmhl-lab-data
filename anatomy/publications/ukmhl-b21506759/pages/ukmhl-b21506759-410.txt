ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. 396 Lobes. This comparison to the letter H serves to remind u.s of certain other parts of the liver, to which particular names have been given. In the upper square of the letter is a tongue-like lobe called " lobulus Spigelii,'" this is connected to the right lobe by a ridge or tail, called " lobulus caudatus." Again, the area of the lower square is called the " lobulus quadratus." Lastly, Fig. 85. 1. Longitudinal fis- sure. 2. Continuation of the longitudi- nal fissure (for the ductus ve- nosus). 3.

DIAGHAM OF THE TJNDEB SUBrACE OF THE LIVEB. the right lobe presents a shallow depression, adapted to the right ^^Thf liver has a thin fibro-cellular coat or capsule, which is best seen on those parts of it not covered by peritoneum. So far it is lite other glandular organs. But the capside does not send down partitions to form a framework for the interior of the organ. At any rate, nothing of the kind is observed with the naked eye when a portion of the capsule is stripped from the surface. Aether there be a cellular framework or not between the lobules, it is cer- tain that it must be exceedingly delicate: this is the reason why the Kver is so liable to be lacerated by external violence, or by the action of the abdominal muscles. , i. i The liver is composed of the ramifications of the portal S^of vein and hepatic artery which carry the blood to it, and secrete the bile; of the ramifications of the excretory liver.

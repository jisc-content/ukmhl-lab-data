48 DISSECTION OF THE FACE. Much practice is required to make a good dissection of the face. The muscles of expression are numerous and complicated ; they are interwoven with the subcutaneous tissue and closely united to the skin; their fibres are often pale and indistinct. The face is amply supplied with motor and sensitive nerves, of which the ramifications extend far and wide. Therefore you must not be discouraged, if in a first attempt you fail to make a satisfactory display of the parts we propose to examine. Make the cheeks tense by filling the mouth with horse-hair and stitch the lips together. Make an incision down the mesial line of the face, and another from the condyle of the jaw to the angle of the mouth. r +1,^ Eecollect that the nerve which supplies all the muscles of the face is the " ^portio dura," or facial division of the seventh cerebral nerve It emerges from the stylo-mastoid foramen, and divides into branches, which pass through the parotid gland, forming a plexus termed the « pes anserinus." The sensitive nerves of the face are supphed by the three di- visions of the fifth cerebral nerve : namely, the supra-orbital branch, the infra-orbital, and the mental; each being named after the oramen in the bone through which it emerges No other nerve takes any share in conferring sensation upon he face excep^^he atuiculo-parotidean branch of the cervical V^f^\(V-^\ ^^^f^ Tpplies L skin covering the parotid gland and paxt of the cheeky The skin covering the cartilages of the nose is supphed by a smill nerv: ca led le naso-lobular.

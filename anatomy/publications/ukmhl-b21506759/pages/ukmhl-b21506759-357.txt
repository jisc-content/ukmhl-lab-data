343 MALE PERINEUM. These muscles are moulded, one upon each crus of the penrs!*""^^ penis. Each 'muscle arises from the inner surface of the tuber ischii: the fibres ascend, completely covering the crus, and terminate on a strong aponeurosis, which is gradually- lost on the corpus cavernosum penis. The action of these muscles is to compress the root of the penis, and so to contribute in some way to the erection of the organ. Fig. 71. Corpus cavernosum Corpus spongiosum Upper fibres . . .

These muscles are always of insignificant size, and perinei. sometimes absent. They arise one on each side from the tuber ischii, and proceed towards the central point of the perineum, where they are blended with the fibres of the accelerator uriuEe. We cut through this muscle with its artery in lithotomy. The next stage of the dissection consists in reflecting and re- moving the accelerator urin^ from the bulb of the lu-ethra and the erector penis with the crus penis from the rami of the pubes and ischium. Eemove also the transversus permei. In short remove everything which obstructs the view of the trianaular ligament. ^ 55 4

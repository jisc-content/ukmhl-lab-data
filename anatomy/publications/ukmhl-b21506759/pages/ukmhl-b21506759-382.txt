368 STRUCTURE OIT THE BLADDER AND PROSTATE. surface, to examine its interior. In a recently contracted bladder, the mucous membrane is disposed in irregular folds; these, how- ever, disappear when the bladder is distended. Under ordinary circumstances the membrane is perfectly pale, but when inflamed it becomes of a bright red colour. If a piece of the membrane, especially when selected from near the neck of the bladder, be placed under the field of a microscope, its surface is seen to be studded with follicles. These follicles secrete the thick ropy mucus in inflammation of the bladder. The orifice of the urethra is situated at the lower and anterior part of the bladder, not at the most dependent part which forms the well behind the orifice, in which urine is so apt to accumulate in old persons. Though it appears small and contracted m the fresh bladder, yet if the little finger be introduced into it, we shaU find that it will gradually dilate to a very considerable size. Imme- diately behind the orifice we observe in some bladders a slight elevation, called the « uvula." It is nothing more than a portion of the mucous membrane raised up by an accumulation of thejub- inucous tissue, and is rarely of sufficient size to interfere with the passage of the urine. This is quite a difi-erent thing from enlarge- ment of the third or middle lobe of the prostate. ^ , . The oHfices of the ureters are about an inch and a half behmd the urethra, and about two inches apart. See how obUquely these tubes perforate the coats of the bladder, slanting towards each other, and standing out in relief under the ^;^cous membrane Moreover, a little ridge proceeds from the orifice of each ureter down to the neck of the bladder, looking Hke a cent— the ureter itself. If the mucous membrane be removed from ^hese ridges, we find that they are produced by muscular fibres. .

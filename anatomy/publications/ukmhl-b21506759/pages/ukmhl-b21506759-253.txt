Below the meta- carpal joint the two tendons for each finger enter the sheath (theca), which confines them in their course along the phalanges. It is formed by a strong fibrous membrane, which is attached to the ridges on the phalanges, and converts the groove in front of these bones into a complete canal, exactly large enough to contain the tendons. The density of the sheath necessarily varies in particular situations, otherwise there would be an obstacle to the easy flexion of the fingers. To ascertain this, cut open one of the sheaths along its entire length; you will then see that it is much stronger between the joints than over the joints themselves; thi-ough these sheaths, inflammation commencing in the integu- ments of the finger may readily extend jto the synovial membrane of the tendon. In cases of whitlow, when matter forms in the theca, the incision should be made deep enough to lay open this fibro-osseous canal, without which the incision will be of no use. It is obvious that the incision should be made down the centre of the finger, to avoid the digital nerves and arteries. If this opening be not timely made, the flexor tendons are likely to slough, and the finger becomes stiff.* fully examining the tntnk of a nerre, or one of its smaUer branches, in the subcutaneous tissue at the root of a finger.

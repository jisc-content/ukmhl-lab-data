230 DISSECTION OF THE EKONT OF THE FOREABM. separately. The anterior passes upwards in front of the brachialis Inticus, and inosculates with the inferior profunda and anastomo- tica magna. The posterior ascends beneath the flexor suhlimis digitorum, to the space between the internal condyle and the ole- cranon, where it inosculates with the same arteries as the anterior (p. 218). The common interosseous artery arises from the ulnar, about an inch and a half below the division of the brachial; and soon divides into the anterior and posterior interosseous, which we shall examine presently. A branch {arteria comes nervi mediani) almost always accom- panies the median nerve. It lies in close contact with the nerve and sometimes i^i its very centre: though usually of small size, it may be as large as the ulnar artery it.elf; and in such a case it passes under the annular ligament with the nerve, to jom the palmar arch. This is interesting, because it helps to explain the recurrence of haemorrhage from a wound in the palm, even after the radial and ulnar arteries have been tied. _ The anterior and posterior carpal branches commumcate with corresponding branches from the radial, and supply the synovial membrane and bones of the carpus. -, , i , This nerve runs behind the internal condyle between Ulnar nerve. ^^.^.^g flg^o^ carpi ulnaris.

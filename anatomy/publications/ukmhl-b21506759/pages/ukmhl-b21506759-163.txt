DISSECTION OF THE TONGUE. 149 The larynx of the adult male is in all proportions about one third larger than that of the adult female. The alee of the thyroid cartilage form a more acute angle in the male; hence the greater projection of the " pomum Adami," and the greater length of the vocal cords, in the male. The average length of the vocal cords is in tie I ^'^^^ • • ' Klines. /Female . , 6 „ The average length of the glottis is in the . 5^^^^ ... 12 lines. < Female . . 10 „ The size of the larynx does not necessarily follow the proportions of the general stature ; it may be as large in a little person as in a tall one: this corresponds with what we know of the voice. Crico-thy- This perfect little joint is provided with a capsule and latio^^'"'" membrane. There are, besides, two strong ligaments. Both proceed from the cornu of the thyroid cartilage; the one upwards and backwards, the other downwards and forwards to the cricoid. Eemember that the only kind of motion permitted is vertical: and that this motion regulates the tension of the vocal cords. DISSECTION OP THE TONGUE. The tongue is a complex muscular organ, subservient to taste speech, suction, mastication, and deglutition. It is connected by Its muscles (genio-hyo-glossus, hyo-glossus, and stylo-glossus) to the symphysis of the jaw, to the os-hyoides, and to the styloid process of the temporal bone. To the soft palate it is connected by the anterior palatine arch (p. 133): and to the epiglottis by iolds of mucous membrane; in the middle fold is enclosed a layer of elastic tissue, caUed the « glosso-epiglottidean'' ligament. This pulls up the epiglottis when the tongue is put out of the mouth • hence the rule of never attempting to pass a tube into the cSopha-

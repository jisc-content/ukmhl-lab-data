228 DISSECTION OF THE FKONT OE THE FOREARM. lastly, upon the pronator quadratus. It is accompanied by two veins, wliich communicate at frequent intervals, and join the vena3 comites of the brachial artery at the bend of the elbow. In the middle third of its course the artery is accompanied by the radial nerve, (a branch of the musculo-spiral) which lies to its outer side. Below this point, the nerve leaves the artery, and passes under the tendon of the supinator longus to the back of the hand. Thus, in the situation where the pulse is felt, the radial nerve no longer accompanies the artery; nevertheless, the vessel is not mthout a nerve, for it is accompanied by a branch of the external cutaneous, which runs superficial to it. ^ „ . The radial artery sends off in" the forearm the followmg lor'xnclics * —* ' The radial remrrent is given off just below the elbow; it passes outwards to supply the long and short supinator and the two radial extensors. One of its ramifications runs up with the musculo- spiral nerve, and sometimes forms a delicate inosculation with the superior profunda (p. 218). ■,. n r, + The arteria superficialis voloi arises from the radial, about halt an inch, or more, above the lower end of the radius; it runs superficially over the anterior annular Hgament of the carpus above or perhaps through the origin of the muscles of the ball of the thumb, into the palm of the hand, where i inosculates with the superficial branch of the ulnar, and completes the superficial palmar arch* (p. 235). _ nf The anterior and posterior carpal arteries are small bianches o the radial, which run beneath the tendons, and .^^PP^^ ^^^j^f membrane and bones of the carpus, anastomosing mth the inter- osseous arteries and carpal branches of the ulnar.

156 EXIT OF CRANIAL NERVES. looseness accounts for the extensive effusions of blood which one sees after injuries on the head: 2. It admits of large flaps of the scalp being detached from the skull-cap; but these flaps do not mortify because they carry their blood-vessels with them: 3. In phlegmonous erysipelas of the scalp, it becomes infiltrated with pus and sloughs ; hence the necessity of making incisions : for the scalp wiU not lose its vitality and Hberate the sloughs like the skm of other parts under similar conditions, and why? because its vessels run above the diseased tissue, and therefore its supply of blood is not cut off. , -, . j ^i. The absorbent vessels of the scalp run backwards towards the occiput where they enter the absorbent glands in that situation. Here, therefore, one finds glandular enlargements when the scalp . is diseased. The brain should now be removed. This organ, with its mem- branes, will be described in a subsequent part of this work At pre- sent we propose to examine the nerves as they pass out of the base of the skuU, and then to dissect the cavernous smus and the orbit. The cranial nerves proceed in pairs through the S:r'' foramina at the base of the skuU; they are named- nerves. £j.gt^ second, third, fourth pair, &c. &c., according to their order of succession from before backwards. The first pair are the olfactory nerves. These camiot be seen, because the olfactory lobes aa-e removed with the braan and torn fiom the delicate filaments which pass through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. The second {optic mwe) passes ttoough the foramen opticum (motor ocu«) passes through the dura mater elose behind the anterior clinoid process. TlVfourth i^athetims), a small nerve, passes through the dura mater a little behind the posterior clinoid process. The fim (trigemmal nerve) passes through an aperture m the dura mater beneath the tentorium cerebelli, just above the point of the petrous portion of the temporal bone.

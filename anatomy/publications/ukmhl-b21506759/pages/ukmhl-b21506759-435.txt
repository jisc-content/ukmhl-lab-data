PARTS CONCERNED IN FEMORAL HERNIA. 421 phenous openirigj as shown in fig. 94. By this proceeding, you see the fascia transversalis coming down over the femoral vessels, and forming the front part of their sheath. The hind part of the sheath, remember, is formed by the pubic portion of the fascia lata, which runs up behind the vessels to join the fascia iliaca. If asked how low the sheath descends, I should say that, about the lower horn of the saphenous opening, it is gradually lost upon the proper investment of the femoral vessels. Fig. 94. 1,1.

Examine for yourselves the texture and the degree of resistance of the sheath by introducing the finger into it from within the abdomen. Try to make an artificial hernia. You will find the sheath offers considerable resistance. If violence be used, the sheath will either give way, like an elastic membrane, or the finger will force a passage through one of the small openings which exist in the sheath for the transmission of the femoral absorbents. Practically, the sheath is important for many reasons A femoral hernia descends inside it. 2. It forms, therefore^ one of E E 3

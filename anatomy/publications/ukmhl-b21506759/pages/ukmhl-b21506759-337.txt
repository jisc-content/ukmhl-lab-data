Lastly, there pass through the crus, on each side, the sympathetic, the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves. Function of ^he diaphragm is the great muscle concerned in in- phragm 'P^'''''^^^^' ^^^^ therefore, truly say, with Haller, that it is " musculus post cor nobilissimus." During in- spiration, the muscular sides of the diaphragm contract and become less arched (as shown by the dotted line in fig. 66); the floor of the chest sinks in conse- Fig. 66. quence, and more room is made for the expansion of the lungs. During expira- tion the diaphragm relaxes and is forced up to its former position by the pressure of the abdominal muscles on the viscera. This alternate falling and rising of the dia- phragm constitutes the me- chanical part of the breath- ing. But the diaphragm conduces to the performance of many other functions. Acting in concert with the abdominal muscles, it assists in the expulsion of the fteces and the urine, also in parturition and in vomiting: for in all these operations, we first take in a deep breath, that the dia- phragm may be in a state of contraction, and so form a resisting surface against which the viscera may be compressed by the ab"- dominal muscles Moreover, by its rapid or spasmodic contrac- tions it IS one of the chief agents concerned in laughing, sneezin^, coughing, hiccough. * The nerves of the diaphragm are the phrenic (p. 91), and the five T 2 DIAPHBAGM PBOM ITS XJPPEB STJEFACE.

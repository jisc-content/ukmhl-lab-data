POSITION 01? ABDOMINAL VISCERA. 303 projects beneath the cartilage of the ninth rib. This is important in a practical point of view : it sometimes happens that the gall- bladder, in consequence of some obstruction to its duct, becomes unusually distended, and, imder such circumstances, occasions a swelling below the margin of the ribs, which might be mistaken for an hepatic abscess.* The close proximity of the gall-bladder to the duodenum and the transverse colon explains the occasional evacuation of gall-stones by ulceration into the intestinal canal.f Stomach. ^^^^^ °f stomach is situated under the shelter of the left hypochondrium, and, when distended, occupies nearly the whole of it; but the narrow or pyloric end extends obUquely across the epigastrium into the right hypochon- drium, where it is overlapped by the liver. The position of the great end of the stomach explains the peculiar sonorousness which percussion frequently elicits over the left hypochondrium, and even for some distance up the side of the chest; so that, when the sto- mach IS large and flatulent, it is often very difficult to ascertain how much of the sound belongs to the stomach ; how much to the chest. The pressure of the flatulent stomach upon the heart ac- count also for the irregular action of this organ observable in cases 01 indigestion. Spleen. "^^^ '^P^^en is situated deep in the left hypochondrium between the stomach and the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs. Its outer surface is free and convex, to correspond with the diaphragm and the ribs; its inner surface, where its great vessels enter it, is concave and connected to the great end of the stomach by a peritoneal fold called the "gasiro-splenic omentum." Gene- rally too, the spleen is connected by a small peritoneal fold to the diaphragm. J Pancreas. '^^^^ the salivary gland of the abdomen.

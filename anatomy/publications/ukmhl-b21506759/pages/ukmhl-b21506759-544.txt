DISSECTION OF THE EYE. 530 and very dark in coloui-. The third coat called the " retina," con- sists of the expansion of the optic nerve for the reception of the impression of light. The great bulk of the interior is filled with a transparent humour called the " vitreous." Imbedded in the front of this, and just behind the pupil, is the crystalline lens for the purpose of concentrating the rays of light. In front of the lens is placed a moveable curtain, called the "iris" in order to regulate the quantity of light which shall be admitted through the pupil. The space in which the iris is suspended is filled with a fluid termed the " aqueous " humour.

The thickest part of the sclerotic coat is at the back of the globe (fig. 131): here it is perforated by the optic nerve a little on the nasal side of the axis of vision.f Aroimd the optic nerve it is perforated by the ciliary arteries, veins, and nerves, for the supply of the cho- roid coat and the iris.

Similar plates are found in some of the reptiles, and particularly in the fossil icthyosauri and plesiosauri. t The optic nerve does not pass through a single large hole in the sclerotic, but through a net-work of fibrous tissue. It is also very much constricted just at its entrance.

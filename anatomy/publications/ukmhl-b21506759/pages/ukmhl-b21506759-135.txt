121 STRUCTURE OF THE LUNGS. the left ventricle at its thickest part—i. e. the middle—is about half an inch. In the female the average is less. PeciTHarities ^^^^^ ^^^^^ ^^^^^ ^om that of the adult of foetal in the following points: — !. The Eustachian valve is well developed in order to guide the current of blood from the vena cava inferior into the foramen ovale. 2. The foramen ovale is widely open. 3. The right and left pulmonary arteries are very much contracted, so as to admit very little blood to the lungs. 4. The ductus arteriosus (from the pulmonary artery to the aorta,) is widely open. 5. The right and left ventricles are of equal thickness because they have equal work to do. Circulation ^he umbilical vein, fig. 23 bringing pure blood from the ^ the fSt'us'^ placenta, enters at the umbilicus, and goes to the imder surface of the liver, where it divides into many branches, which join the hepatic circulation. One of these branches, termed the "dtictus venosus," goes straight into the inferior vena cava. From the inferior vena cava the blood enters the right auricle, and this stream (directed by the Eustachian valve) flows through the foramen ovale into the left auricle. From the left auricle it runs into the left ventricle, and thence through the aorta, into the great vessels of the head and the upper limbs, which are in this way supplied by almost piu-e blood. From the head and the upper limbs, the blood returns (impm-e) through the superior vena cava into the right auricle, and flows into the right ventricle. From the right ventricle it passes throuah the pulmonary artery, and the "ductus arteriosus;' into the third part of the arch of the aorta; only a very small quantity of it o-oes to the lungs. From the aorta the blood is conveyed through the umbilical arteries to the placenta, where it is purified. STRUCTUEE OF THE LUNGS. _ The lungs^ are very vascular, spongy organs, in which the blood IS purified by exposure to atmospheric air. Their situation and

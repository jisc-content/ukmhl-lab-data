164 DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. Fig. 36. INSERTION OF THE RECTI MUSCLES "WITH ANTERIOR CILIARY ARTERIES. The recti muscles enable us to direct the eye towards different points: hence the names given to them by Albinus â€” attollens, depressor, adductor, and abductor oculi. It is obvious that, by the single action of one, or the com- bined action of two, the eye can be turned towards any direction. Follow the recti to the eye, in order to see the beautiful shining tendons by which they are in- serted. Notice also the " anterior ciliary arteries " which run to the eye along the tendons. The con- gestion of these little vessels oc- casions the red zone roimd the cornea in iritis. We have already mentioned that the tendons are invested by a fascia, which passes from one to the other, forming a loose tunic over the back of the eye. It is this fascia which resists the passage of the hook in the operation for the cure of squinting. Even after the com- plete division of the tendon, the eye may still be held m its faulty position, if this tissue, instead of possessing its proper soft- ness and pliancy, happen to have become contracted and un- yielding. Under such circumstances it is necessary to divide it freely with the scissors. By removing the conjunctival coat of the eye, the tendons of the recti are soon exposed. The breadth and the precise situation of their insertion deserves attention in reference to the operation for strabismus. The breadth of their insertion is about three eio-hths of an inch, but the line of this insertion is not at all points equidistant from the cornea. The centre of the insertion is nearer to the cornea by about one line than either end. Taking the internal rectus, which, by the way, we have most frequently occasion to divide in strabismus, we find that the centre of its tendon is, upon an average, three lines only from the cornea, the lower part nearly five lines, and the upper four. It is, therefore.

24 , ,• Ucp of the triangle mentioned an effaces backward, wkh a lower edge behind, forming the roof of a concrescent external auditory meatus common to both embryos. Within the concrescent tympanum into which the meatus led, there was observed an ossicle somewhat X shined the lower and longer limbs of which were nmnubna of a*conjunct malleus ; but unfortunately the ossicle has not been preserved. «c6 The viscera of the same monstrosity exhibit various peculiarities which are more or less peculiar to this particular snecimen The two embryos deviate in various particulars from the perfect symmetry exhibited superficially and throughout the muscular and osseous systems. The pharynx is symmetrical and has coming off from it two quite similar larynges, and from each larynx trachea and lungs come off, the two sets nearly symmetrical, but those of the left embryo a little larger than those of the right embryo A well developed tongue projects forwards between the larynges and is conjunct in formation, belonging equa ly to each of the two embryos. But, from its base there passes backwards, to be attached somewhat more broadly behind, another muscular mass cylindrically surrounded by mucous membrane and obviously an imperfect conjunct tongue dorsally correspondent with the better developed tongue belonging to the jaws of the conjunct face. The oesophagus is symmetrical and extends down to a symmetrical stomach with a right and a left sinus magnus equally developed, similar to that which is seen in specimen 735 (Monstrous Kitten), but having two spleens connected with it, one opposite each sinus magnus. The stomach is continuous with the well developed intestine of the right embryo ; while on turning to the left embryo, we trace upwards from the pehis a oojp'h csecum and vermiform appendix, as in the right embryo, hut find the small intestine much less elongated, and ending abruptly above in a blind extremity, obviously torn, during development, away from the part of the canal common to both embryos, very likely at the opening of the hepatic duct. There is one principal liver which lay in the part of the abdomen common to the two embryos, its dorsum occupying the whole breadth, and pierced in the middle by the umbilical vein. This vein communicated by a direct passage with the inferior vena cava of the left embryo, and thus the blood had been led into the right auricle of the well-developed heart of the left embryo, whence it had passed apparently by the usual foetal route to the upper and lower parts of the body successively. 1 he heart of the right embryo is not half the size of the heart ot the left embryo, but the aorta in its abdominal part is as large as

Human embryo, early part of third month ; over 1^ inch long. Put up to show the condition of the skeleton. Clavicle ossified throughout, save quite at the extremities. Vertebral column shows no commencement of ossification. Shafts of ribs ossifying forward from their angles for more than half their length. Sternum, no ossification. One centre of ossification proceeding backward from neck of scapula. Shafts of humerus, radius and ulna, each an elongated ossification. Ossification just commencing in last phalanx of forefinger and middle finger, and on left side in that of the fourth and of the fifth digit. Ilium shows very slight ossification; femur a shorter ossification than the humerus • leg bones with ossifications about as long as those of the bones of forearm; no ossification of feet. Occipital bone shows a sym- metrical ossification corresponding with the two lower which have been figured in the expanded part of the occipital; frontal shows ossific network along whole supraorbital ridge and ascending therefrom ; parietal shows network at lower and forepart. Neither frontal nor parietal appears to have the ossification starting from the eminence. Each half of mandible ossified throughout its length. Malar distinct, also zygomatic process. In the upper jaw it is impossible to make out separation of the palatal, superior maxillary and intermaxillary; but three ascending processes can be seen on each side, probably corresponding with these three bones.

FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. 7io they aro termed by Kobelt the bnlbi vcstibuli; and he considers them analogous to the bulb of the corpus spongiosum in the male. Immediately in front of these bodies is a smaller venous plexus, continuous with the bulbi vestibuli behind, and the glans clitoridis in front: it is called by Kobelt the pars intermedia, and is considered by him as analogous to that part of the body of the corpus spongiosum which immediately succeeds the bulb. 381.â€”Section of Female Felvis, showing Position of Viscera. Bladder. The bladder is situated at the anterior part of the pelvis. It is in relation in front, with the os pubis; behind, with the uterus, some convolutions of the small intestine being interposed ; its base lies in contact with the reck of the uterus, and with the anterior wall of the vagina. The bladder is said to be larger in the female than in the male, and is very broad in its transverse diameter. Urethra. The urethra is a narrow membranous canal, about an inch and a half in length, extending from the neck of the bladder to the meatus urinarius. It is placed, beneath the symphysis pubis, imbedded in the anterior wall of the vagina; and its direction is obliquely downwards and forwards, its course being slightly curved, the concavity directed forwards and upwards. Its diameter, when un- dilated, about a quarter of an inch. The urethra perforates the triangular ligament, precisely as in the male, and is surrounded by the muscular fibres of the Compressor urethrae. Structure. The urethra consists of three coats : muscular, erectile, and mucous. The muscular coat is continuous with that of the bladder; it extends the whole length, of the tube, and consists of a thick stratum of circular fibres.

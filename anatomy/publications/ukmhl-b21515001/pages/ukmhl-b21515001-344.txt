MUSCLES AND FASCIAE. 2 IO The Rectus superior, the thinnest and narrowest of the four Recti, arises from the upper margin of the optic foramen, beneath the Levator Palpebrse and Superior oblique, and from the fibrous sheath of the optic nerve; and is inserted, by a ten- !4y.—Muscles of the Right Orbit. dinous expansion, into the sclerotic coat, about three or four lines from the margin of the cornea. Relations. By its tipper surface, with the Levator Palpebrae. By its under surface, with the optic nerve, the ophthalmic artery, the nasal nerve, and the branch of tire third nerve, which supplies it; and, in front, with the tendon of the Superior oblique, and the globe of the eye. The Inferior and Internal Recti arise by a common tendon (the ligament of Zinn), which is attached round the circumference of the optic foramen, except at i JLftty j /ld~. 150.—The relative position and attachment of the Muscles of the Left Eyeball. its upper and outer part.

Each muscle passes forward in the position implied by its name, to be inserted, by a tendinous ex- pansion (the tunica albuijiuea), intq_ the sclerotic coat, about three or four lines from tiie margin of the cornea. Between the two hehds of the External rectus is a narrow interval, through which pass the third, nasal branch of the fifth, and sixth nerves, and the ophthalmic vein. Although nearly all these muscles present a common origin, and are inserted in a similar manner in the sclerotic coat, there arc certain differences to be observed in them, as regards their length and breadth.] The Internal Rectus is the broadest; the External,.the longest; and the Superior, the thinnest and narrowest. The Superior Oblique is a fusiform muscle, placed at the upper and inner side of the orbit, internal to the Levator palpebral. It arises about a line abovejtho inner margin of the optic foramen, and, passing forwards to the inner angle of the orbit, terminates in a rounded tend on, which plays in a ring or pulley, formed by fibro-cartilaginous tissue attached to a depression beneath the internal angular process of the frontal bone, the contiguous surfaces of the tendon and ring beinr

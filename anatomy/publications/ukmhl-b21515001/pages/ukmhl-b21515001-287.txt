OF THE ATLAS WITH THE AXIS. z53 Circumduction is very limited, and is produced merely by a succession of tlio preceding movements. Rotation is produced by tlie twisting of tlie intervertebral substances ; this, although only slight between any two vertebrae, produces a great extent of move- ment, when it takes place in the whole length of the spine, the front of the column being turned to one or the other side. This movement takes place only to a slight extent in the neck, but is more free in the lower part of the dorsal and lumbar regions. It is thus seen, that the cervical region enjoys the greatest extent of each variety of movement, flexion and extension especially being very free. In the dorsal region, especially at its upper part, the movements are most limited ; flexion, extension, and lateral motion taking place only to a slight extent. II. Articulation of the Atlas with the Axis. The articulation of the anterior arch of the atlas with the odontoid process forms a lateral ginglymoid joint, whilst that between the articulating processes of the two bones forms a double arthrodia. The ligaments which connect these bones are, the Two Anterior Atlo-Axoid. Transverse. Posterior Atlo-Axoid. Two Capsular. Of the Tivo Anterior Atlo-Axoid Ligaments (fig. 117), the more superficial is a rounded cord, situated in the middle line ; it is attached, above, to the tubercle on 117-â€”Occipito-Atloid and Atlo-Axoid Ligaments. Front View. the anterior arch of the atlas ; below, to the base of the odontoid process and body of the axis, fhe deeper ligament is a membranous layer, attached, above, to the lower border of the anterior arch of the atlas ; below, to the base of the odontoid process, and body of the axis. These ligaments are in relation, in front, with the Recti antici majores. The Posterior Atlo-Axoid Ligament (fig. 118) is abroad and thin membranous layer, attached, above, to the lower border of the posterior arch of the atlas ;

i6S ARTICULATIONS. of the pubic arch. Above, it is blended with the interarticular fibro-cartilage; ft era ly, with the rami of the pubes. Its fibres are of a yellowish colour, closely connected, and have an arched direction. Ihe Interarticular Fibru-Gartilage consists of two oval-shaped plates, one covering the surface of each symphysis pubis. They vary in thickness in iffeient subjects, and project somewhat beyond the level of the bones, espe- cially behind. The outer surface of each plate is firmly connected to the bone y a series of nipple-like processes, which accurately fit within corresponding cepicssions on the osseous surface. Their opposed surfaces are connected in the greater part of their extent, by an intermediate elastic fibrous tissue; and by t en ciicumference to the various ligaments surrounding the joint. An interspace is e t between the plates at the upper and back part of the articulation, where e bious tissue is deficient, and the surface of the fibro-cartilage is lined by epithelium. This space is found at all periods of life, both in the male and female; but it is larger in the latter, especially during pregnancy, and after parturition. It is most frequently limited to the upper and back part of the joint; 129.â€”Vertical Section of the Symphysis Pubis.

This structure may be easily demonstrated, by making a vertical section of the symphysis pubis near its posterior surface. The Obturator Ligament is more properly regarded as analogous to the mus- cular fasciae, with which it will therefore be described. ARTICULATIONS OP THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The articulations of the Upper Extremity may be arranged in the follow- ing groups I. Sterno-clavicular articulation. II. Scapulo-clavicular articula- tion. III. Ligaments of the Scapula. IV. Shoulder-joint. V. Elbow-joint. VI. Radio-ulnar articulations. VII. Wrist-joint. VIII. Articulations of the Carpal bones. IX. Carpo-metacarpal articulations. X. Metacarpo-phalangeal articulations. XI. Articulations of the Phalanges. I. Sterno-Clavicular Articulation. (Pig. 130.) The Sterno-Clavicular is an arthrodial joint. The parts entering into its fpTrpn.tion are the sternal end of the clavicle, the upper and lateral part of the first piece of the sternum, and the cartilage of the first rib. The articular surface

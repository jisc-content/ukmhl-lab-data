cix THE PLACENTA. The Placenta is the organ by which the connection between the foetus and mother is maintained, and through wrhich blood reaches the foetus and is returned to the uterus. It therefore subserves the purposes both of circulation and respiration. It is formed of two parts, as already shown— viz. the maternal portion which is developed out of the decidua vera Fig. XLIX.—Sectional plan of the gravid uterus, from Wagner, in the third and fourth month, a, Plug of mucus in neck of uterus, b, Fallopian tube, c, The decidua vera ; c2, the decidua vera passing into the right Fallopian tube: the cavity of the uterus is almost completely occupied by the ovum; ee, points of the reflection of the decidua re- flexa (in nature the united deciduas do not stop here, but pass over the whole uterine surface of the placenta); g, supposed allantois; h, umbilical vesicle; i, amnion; k, chorion, covered with the decidua reflexa; cl, cavity of the decidua;decidua serotina, or placental decidua. (serotina), and the foetal placenta formed by the villous chorion. Its shape in the human subject is that of a disc, one side of which adheres to the uterine walls, while the other is covered by the amnion. The villi of the chorion (or foetal placenta) gradually enlarge, forming large projections— 4 cotyledons ’—which each contain the ramifications of vessels communi- cating with the umbilical arteries and veins of the foetus. These vascular tufts are covered with epithelium, and project into corresponding depres- sions in the mucous membrane of the uterine walls. The maternal portion of the placenta consists of a large number of cells formed by an enlarge- ment of the vessels of the uterine wall, and conveying the uterine blood into close proximity to the villi of the foetal placenta, which dip into these cells. The interchange of fluids, necessary for the growth of the foetus, and for the depuration of the blood, tahes place through the walls of these

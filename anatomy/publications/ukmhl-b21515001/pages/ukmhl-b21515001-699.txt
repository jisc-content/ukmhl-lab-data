565 THE TONGUE. membrane, which form the glosso-epiglottic ligaments, and with the soft palate and pharynx by means of the anterior and posterior pillars of the fauces. Its apex or tip, thin and narrow, is directed forwards against the inner surface of the lower incisor teeth. The under surface of the tongue is connected with the lower jaw by the Genio-hyo-glossi muscles ; from its sides, the mucous membrane is reflected to the inner surface of the gums ; and, in front, a distinct fold of that membrane, the frcenum linguce, is formed beneath its-under surlace. The tip of the tongue, part of its under surface, its sides, and dorsum, are free. The dorsum of the tongue is convex, marked along the middle line by a raphe, which divides it into two symmetrical halves ; and this raphe terminates behind, about half an inch from the base of the organ, a little in front of a deep mucous follicle, the foramen ccecum. The anterior two-thirds of this surface are rough, and covered with papilla); the posterior third is more smooth, and covered by the projecting orifices of numerous muciparous glands. The mucous membrane invests the entire extent of the free surface of the tongue On the under surface of the organ it is thin and smooth, and may be traced on either side of the frsenum, through the ducts of the submaxillary glands; and between the sides of the tongue and the lower jaw, through the ducts of the sub- lingual glands. As it passes over the borders of the organ, it gradually assumes its papillary character. The mucous membrane of the tongue consists of structures analogous to those of the skin, namely, a cibtis or corivm, supporting numerous papillce, and covered, as well as the papillae,, with epithelium. The cutis is tough, but thinner and less dense than in most parts of the skin, and is composed of similar tissue. It contains the ramifications of the numerous vessels and nerves from which the papillae are supplied, and affords insertion to all the intrinsic muscular fibres of the organ. The papillae of the' tongue are thickly distributed over the whole of its upper surface, giving to it its characteristic roughness. They are more prominent than those of the skin, standing out from the. surface like the villi of the intestine. The principal varieties are- the papillae rjmwrv (cir cum vallate©), papilla mediae (fungi formes), and papillae minimae (conicce or filiform.es). The papillce maximee (circumvallatee) are of large size, and vary from eight to ten in number. They are situated at the back part of the dorsum of the tongue, near its base, forming a row on each side, which, running backwards and inwards, meet in the middle line, like the two lines of the letter V inverted. Each papilla consists of a central flattened projection of mucous membrane, circular in form, from to of an inch wide, attached to the bottom of a cup-shaped depression of the mucous membrane ; the exposed part being covered with numerous small papilla). The cup-shaped depression forms a kind of fossa round the papilla, having a circular margin of about the same elevation, covered with smaller papillae. The fissure corresponding to the papilla, which is situated at the junction of the two lines of the circumvallate papillae, is so large and deep, that the namq foramen ccecum has been applied to it. In the smaller papillce, the fissure exists only on one side. The papillce mediae (fungiformes), more numerous than the preceding, are scattered irregularly and sparingly over the dorsum of the tongue ; but are found chiefly at its sides and arpex. They are easily recognised, among tbe other papillae, by their large size, rounoU^flk eminences, and deep red colour. They are narrow at their attachment to the 'nongue, but broad and rounded at their free extremities, and covered with secondary papillae. Their epithelial investment is very thin. The papillce minima?- (conicce—filiformcs) cover the anterior two-thirds- of the dorsum oi the tongue. They are very minute, more or loss conical or filiform in shape, and arranged in lines corresponding in direction with the two rows of the papillce eircumvallato); excepting at the apex of the organ, where their direction

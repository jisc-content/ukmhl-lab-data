Detach the External oblique by dividing it across, just in front of its attach- tnent to the ribs, as far as its posterior border, and separating it below from the crest of ilium as far as the spine ; then separate the muscle carefully from the Internal oblique, which lies beneath, and turn it towards the opposite side. The Internal or Ascending Oblique Muscle (fig. 164), thinner and smaller than tlie preceding, beneath which it lies, is of an irregularly quadrilateral form, and situated at the side and ftme part of the abdomen. It arises, by fleshy fibres, from the outer half of Poupart’s ligament, being attached to the groove on its upper surface ; from the anterior two-thirds of the middle lip of the crest of the ilium, and from the lumbar fascia. From this origin, the fibres diverge: those from Poupart’s ligament, few in number and paler in colour than tlio rest, arch 248 MUSCLES AND FASCIJE. surface, with tho Internal oblique, the lower part of tho eight inferior ribs, and Intercostal muscles, the cremaster, tho spermatic cord in the male, and round ligamont in the female.

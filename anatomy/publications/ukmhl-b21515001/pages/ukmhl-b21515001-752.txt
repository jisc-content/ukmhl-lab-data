618 ORGANS OF DIGESTION. I upon the in ernal surface of the pariotos of those cavities, forming the parietal layer. The free surfaco of tho peritoneum is smooth, moist, and covered by a thin squamous epithelium ; its attached surface is rough, being connected to the viscera and inner surface of the parietes by means of areolar tissue, called the subperitoneal areolar tissue. The parietal portion is loosely connected with the fascia lining tho abdomen and pelvis ; but more closely to the under surfaco of the Diaphragm, and in the middle line of the abdomen. In order to trace the reflections of this membrane (fig. 332), the abdomen having been opened, the liver should be raised and supported in that position, and the stomach should be depressed, when a thin membranous layer is seen passing 332-â€”The Reflections of the Peritoneum, as seen in a vertical Section of the Abdomen. from the transverse fisstlre of the liver to the upper border of the stomach : this is the lesser or gastro-liepatic omentum. It consists of two delicate layers of peri- toneum, an anterior and a posterior, between which are continued the hepatic vessels and nerves. Of these two layers, the anterior should first be traced, and then the posterior, The anterior layer descends to the lesser curvature of the stomach, and covers its anterior surface as far as the great curvature; it descends for some distance in front of the small intestines, and, returning Upon itself to the transverse colon, forms the external layer of the great omentum ; it then covers the under surface of the transverse colon, and, passing to the back part of the abdominal Cavity, forms the inferior layer of the transverse meso-colon. It then descends in front of the duodenum, the aorta, and vena cava, as far as the superior mesenteric artery, along which it passes to invest the small intestines, and, returning to the vertebral

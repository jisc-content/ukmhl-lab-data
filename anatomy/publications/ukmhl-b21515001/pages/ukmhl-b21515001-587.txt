453 DEEP CERVICAL GLANDS. root of the neck, in the triangular interval between the clavicle, the Sterno- mastoid, and the Trapezius, where they are continuous with the axillary glands. A few small glands are also found on the front and sides of the larynx. The deep cervical glands (fig. 249) are numerous and of large size ; they form an uninterrupted chain along the sheath of the carotid artery and internal jugular vein, lying by the side of the pharynx, oesophagus, and trachea, and extending from the base of the skull to the thorax, where they communicate with the lymphatic glands in that cavity. 249.â€”The Deep Lymphatics and Glands of the Neck and Thorax. The superficial and deep cervical lymphatics are a continuation of those already described on the cranium and face. After traversing the glands in those regions, they pass through the chain of glands which lie along the sheath of the carotid vessels, being joined by the lymphatics from the pharynx, oesophagus, larynx, trachea, and thyroid gland. At the lower part of the neck, after receiving some lymphatics from the thorax, they unite into a single trunk, which terminates on the left side, in the thoracic duct; on the right side, in the right lymphatic duct. Lymphatics op tiie Upper Extremity. The I/ympliatic Glands of the upper extremity (fig. 250) may bo subdivided into two sets, superficial and deep.

It is certainly the most instructive and the most teaching work on its subject in the English language. The plan of the work is thoroughly clinical; it aims principally at the inculcation of rules and means for the recognition of the affections of which it treats; and a careful study of it must conduce to engender in the student the habit of accuracy in diagnosis. . . . We assure the student that Dr. Murchison’s book is not only the best guide to the recognition and rational treatment of hepatic diseases, but that to the dili- gent reader it will prove an excellent instructor in diagnostic means and method in general.”—Si.

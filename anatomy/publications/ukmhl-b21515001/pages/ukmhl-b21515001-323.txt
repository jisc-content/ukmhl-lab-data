Ligamenta a,1 aria. Tnh Anterior Ligament, or Ligamentum Patellce (fig. 139) is that portion of the common tendon of the extensor muscles of the thigh which is continued from the patella to the tubercle of the tibia, supplying the place of an anterior ligament. 139.—Right Knee-Joint. Anterior View. 140.—Right Knee-Joint. Posterior View. It is a strong, flat ligamentous band, about three inches in length, attached, above, to the apex of the patella and the rough depression on its posterior surface ; below, to the lower part of the tuberosity of the tibia ; its superficial fibres being continuous across the front of the patella with"those of the tendon of the Quadificeps extensor. Two synovial bursae are connected with this ligament and the patella ; one is inter- posed between the patella and the skin covering its anterior surface; the other of small size, between the ligamentum patellae and the upper part of the tuberosit}r of the tibia. The posterior surface of this ligament is separated above from the knee-joint by a large mass of adipose tissue 5 its lateral margins are continuous with the aponeuroses derived from the Yasti muscles. The Posterior Ligament, Ligamentum Posticum Winslowii (fig. 140), is a broad, flat, fibrous band, which covers over the whole of the back part of the joint. It consists of two lateral portions, formed chiefly of vertical fibres, which arise above from the condyles of the femur, and are connected below_ with the back part head of the tibia, being closely united with the tendons of the Gastrocnemius,

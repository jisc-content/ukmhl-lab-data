392 ARTERIES. under the name of the superior hcemorrhoidal artery. It lies at first in close rela- tion with the loft side of the aorta, and then passes in front of the left common iliac artery. Its branches are the Colica sinistra. Superior hromorrhoidal. Sigmoid. 226.â€”The Inferior Mesenteric and its Branches. The colica sinistra passes behind the peritoneum, in front of the left kidney, to reach the descending colon, and divides into two branches: an ascending branch, which inosculates with the colica media ; and a descending branch, which anastomoses with the sigmoid artery. From the arches formed by these inoscu- lations, branches are distributed to the descending colon. The sigmoid artery runs obliquely downwards across the Psoas muscle to the sigmoid flexure of the colon, and divides into branches which supply that part of the intestine ; anastomosing above, with the colica sinistra; and below, with the superior hsemorrhoidal artery. This vessel is sometimes replaced by three or four small branches. The superior hcemorrhoidal artery, the continuation of the inferior mesenteric, descends into the pelvis between the layers of the meso-rectum, crossing, in its course, the ureter, and left common iliac vessels. Opposite the middle of the sacrum, it divides into two branches, which descend one on each side of the rectum, where they divide into several small branches, which are distributed between the mucous and muscular coats of that tube, nearly as far as its lower end ; anasto-

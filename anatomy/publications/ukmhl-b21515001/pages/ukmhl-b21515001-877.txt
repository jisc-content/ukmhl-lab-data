THE PROSTATE GLAND. 743 f lphincter muscles ; lastly, the anterior fibres, the longest, descend upon the side f the prostate gland to unite beneath it with the muscle of the opposite side, lending with the fibres of the external sphincter and Transversus perinaii muscles, t the tendinous centre of the perineum. The anterior portion is occasionally separated from the rest of the muscle by s ellular tissue. From this circumstance, as well as from its peculiar relation with . ae prostate gland, descending by its side, and surrounding it as in a sling, it has ^.een described by Santorini and others as a distinct muscle, under the name of the levator prostates. In the female, the anterior fibres of the Levator ani descend | pon the sides of the vagina. Relations. By its upper or pelvic surface with the recto-vesical fascia, which pparates it from the viscera of the pelvis and from the peritoneum. By its outer n perinceal surface, it forms the inner boundary of the ischio-rectal fossa, and 11 covered by a quantity of fat, and by a thin layer of fascia continued from the ; bturator fascia. Its posterior border is continuous with the Coccygeus muscle. :s anterior border is separated from the muscle of the opposite side by a triangular pace, through which the urethra, and in the female the vagina, passes from the .el vis. Actions. This muscle supports the lower end of the rectum and vagina, and also ! le bladder during the efforts of expulsion. The Coccygeus is situated behind and parallel with the preceding. It is a viangular plane of muscular and tendinous fibres, arising, by its apex, from the : Dine of the ischium and lesser sacro-sciatic ligament, and inserted, by its base? nto the margin of the coccyx and into the side of the lower piece of the sacrum, his muscle is continuous with the posterior border of the Levator ani, and closes i the back part of the outlet of the pelvis. Relations. By its inner or pelvic surface, with the rectum. By its external urface, with the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament. By its posterior border, with the ’yriformis. Action. The Coccygei muscles raise and support the coccyx, after it has been >>ressed backwards during defsecation or parturition. Position of the Viscera at the Outlet of the Pelvis. Divide the central tendinous point of the •erinseum, separate the rectum from its connections by dividing the fibres of the Levator ni, which descend upon the sides of the prostate gland, and draw the gut backwards towards !he coccyx, when the under surface of the prostate gland, the neck and base of the bladder, :he vesiculse seminales, and vasa deferentia will be exposed. The Prostate Gland is placed immediately in front of the neck of the bladder, ground the prostatic portion of the urethra, its base being turned backwards, and ts under surface towards the rectum. It is retained in its position by the Levator Drostatae and by the pubo-prostatic ligaments, and is invested by a dense fibrous covering, continued from the posterior layer of the deep perinaaal fascia. The ongest diameters of this gland are in the antero-posterior direction, and trans- versely at its base ; and hence the greatest extent of incision that can be made in t without dividing its substance completely across, is obliquely outwards and oackwards. This is the direction in which the incision is made through it in ihe operation of lithotomy, the extent of which should seldom exceed an inch in length. The relations of the prostate to the rectum should be noticed : by means of the finger introduced into the gut, the surgeon detects enlargement or other disease of this organ ; he is enabled also, by the same means, to direct the point of a catheter when its introduction is attended with much difficulty, either from injury or disease of the membranous or prostatic portions of the urethra. Behind the prostate is the posterior surface of the neck and base of the bladder; a small triangular portion of this organ is seen, bounded, in front by the prostate gland ; behind, by the recto-vesical fold of the peritoneum ; on either side, by the vesiculse seminales and vasa deferentia ; and separated from direct contact with the rectum by the recto-vesical fascia. The relation of this portion of tho bladder to tho rectum is of extreme interest to the surgeon. In casos of rctontion of urino

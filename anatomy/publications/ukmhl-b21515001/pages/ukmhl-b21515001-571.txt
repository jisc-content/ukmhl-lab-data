The internal mammary veins, two in number to each artery, follow the course of that vessel, and receive branches corres- ponding with those derived from it. The two veins unite into a single trunk, which terminates in the innominate vein. The inferior thyroid veins, two, frequently three or four in number, arise in the venous plexus, on the thyroid body, communicat- ing with the middle and superior thyroid veins. The left one descends in front of the trachea, behind the Stern o-thyroid muscles, communicating with its fellow by transverse branches, and terminates in the left vena innomi- nata. The right one, which is placed a little to the right of the median line, opens into the right vena innominata, just at its junction with the superior cava. These veins receive tracheal and inferior laryn- geal branches, and are provided with valves at their termination in the innominate veins. The Superior Intercostal Veins return the blood from the upper intercostal spaces. The right superior inter- costal, much smaller than the left, closely corresponds with the superior inter- costal artery, receiving the blood from the first, or first and second intercostal ..

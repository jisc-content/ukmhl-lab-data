THE SKELETON. i3° divided by a vertical ridgo into two lateral halves : the ridge is well marked at its commence- ment at the oblique line, but becomes gradually indistinct be- low : the inner and broader half gives attachment to the Flexor longus digitorum, the outer and narrower to part of the Tibialis posticus. The remaining part of the bone is covered by the Tibialis posticus, Flexor longus digito- rum, and Flexor longus pollicis muscles. Immediately below the oblique line is the medullary foramen, which is directed ob- liquely downwards. The Loiver Extremity, much smaller than the upper, presents five surfaces; it is prolonged downwards, on its inner side, into a strong process, the internal malleolus. The inferior surface of the bone is quadrilateral, and smooth, for articulation with the astragalus. This surface is narrow internally, where it be- comes continuous with the ar- ticular surface of the inner malleolus, broader externally, and traversed from before back- wards by a slight elevation, se- parating two lateral depressions. The anterior surface of the lower extremity is smooth and rounded above, and covered by the tendons of the Extensor muscles of the toes; its lower margin presents a rough trans- verse depression, for the attach- ment of the anterior ligament of the ankle-joint: the posterior surface presents a superficial groove directed obliquely down- wards and inwards, continuous with a similar groove on the posterior extremity of the astra- galus, and serving for the joassage of the tendon of the Flexor longus pollicis: the external surface presents a triangular rough depression for the attach- ment of the inferior interosseous ligament connecting it with the fibula; the lower part of this depression is smooth in some bones, covered with cartilage in i io.—Bones of the Bight Leg.

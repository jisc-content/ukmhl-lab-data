In this situation, the radial nerve lies in close relation with the outer side of the artery, and should, as well as the veins, be carefully avoided. In the lower third, the artery is easily secured by dividing the integument and Mittltal Ji&otwent. Wrist.

Th© branches of the radial artery may be divided into three groups, corresponding with the three regions in which the vessel is situated. f Radial recurrent. In the J Muscular.

Llnterosseous. The radial recurrent is given off immediately below the elbow. It ascends between the branches of the musculo- spiral nerve, lying on the Supinator brevis, and then between the Supinator longus and Bracbialis anticus, sup- plying these muscles and the elbow-joint, and anastomosing with the terminal branches of the superior profunda. The muscular branches are distributed to the muscles on the radial side of the forearm. The superficialis voice arises from the radial artery, just where this vessel is about to wind round the wrist. Run- ning forwards, it passes be- tween the muscles of the thumb, which it supplies, and sometimes anastomoses with the termination of the ulnar artery, completing the super- ficial palmar arch. This ves- sel varies considerably in size, usually it is very small, and terminates in the muscles of the thumb ; sometimes it is as large as the continuation of the radial. 219.—The Surgical Anatomy of tho Radial and Ulnar Arteries iSujx. rficiali s branch tf VIn

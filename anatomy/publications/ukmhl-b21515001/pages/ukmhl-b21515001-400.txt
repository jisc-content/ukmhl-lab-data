Posterior Scapular Region. (Fig. 171.) Supraspinatus. Teres Minor. Infraspinatus. Teres Major. Dissection. To expose these muscles, ond to examine their mode of insertion into the humerus, detach the Deltoid and Trapezius from their attachment to the spine of the scapula and acromion process. Remove the clavicle by dividing the ligaments connecting it with the coracoid process, and separate it at its articulation with its scapula: divide the acromion grocess near its root with a saw. The fragments being removed, the tendons of the posterior capular muscles will he fully exposed, and can he examined. A block should he placed beneath the shoulder-joint, so as to make the muscles tense. The supraspinous aponeurosis is a thick and dense membranous layer, which completes the osseo-fibrous case in which the Supraspinatus muscle is contained; affording attachment, by its inner surface, to some of the fibres of the muscle. It 171.—Muscles on the Dorsum of the Scapula and the Triceps. is thick internally, but thinner externally under the coraco>-acromial ligament. When this fascia is removed, the Supraspinatus muscle is exposed^. The Qu'praspi/uatus muscle occupies the whole of the supraspinal**© fossa, arising from its internal two-thirds, and from the strong fascia whicti covers its surface. The muscular fibres converge to a tendon, which passes across ihe capsular liga- ment of the shoulder-joint, to which it is intimately adherent, and is inserted into the highest of the three facets onthe great tuberosity of tlio humerus.

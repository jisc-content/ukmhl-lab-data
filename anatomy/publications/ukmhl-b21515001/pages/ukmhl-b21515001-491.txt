SUBCLAVIAN. 357 ho vessel to the inner border of the Scalenus anticus. On the loft side it ascends erpendicularly, to gain the inner border of that muscle. The second part passes utwards behind the Scalenus anticus ; and the third part passes from the outer nargin of that muscle, beneath the clavicle, to the lower border of the first rib, vhere it becomes the axillary artery. The first portions of these two vessels differ .0 much in their course, and in their relation with neighbouring parts, that they vill be described separately. The second and third parts are precisely alike on Doth sides. First Part of the Eight Subclavian Artery. (Figs. 205, 207.) The right subclavian artery arises from the arteria innominata, opposite the right 5terno-elavicular articulation, passes upwards and outwards across the root of the neck, and terminates at the inner margin of the Scalenus anticus muscle. In this part of its course it ascends a little above the clavicle, the. extent to' which it does so varying in different cases. It is covered, in front, by the integument, superficial fascia, Platysma, deep fascia, the clavicular origin of the Sterno-mastoid, the Sterno- hyoid, and Sterno-tliyroid muscles, and another layer of the deep fascia. It is crossed by the internal jugular and vertebral veins, and by the pneumogastric, the cardiac branches of the sympathetic, and phrenic nerves. Beneath, the artery is invested by the pleura, and behind, it is separated by a cellular interval from the [ Longus colli, the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, and the sympathetic ; the recurrent laryngeal nerve winding around the lower and back part of the vessel. The subclavian vein lies below the subclavian artery, imme- diately behind the clavicle. Plan of Relations of First Portion of Right Subclavian Artery. In front. Clavicular origin of Sterno-mastoid. Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thvroid. Internal jugular and vertebral veins. Pneumogastric, cardiac and phrenic nerves. Beneath. Pleura. Behind. Recurrent laryngeal nerve. Sympathetic. Longus colli. Transverse process of seventh cervical vertebra. Right Subclavian Artery. First portion. First Part of the Left Subclavian Artery. (Fig. 205.) The left subclavian artery arises from the end of the transverse portion of the brch of the aorta, opposite the second dorsal vertebra, and ascends to the inner margin of the first rib, behind the insertion of the Scalenus anticus muscle. This vessel is, therefore, longer than the right, situated more deeply in the cavity of the chest, and directed almost vertically upwards, instead of arching outwards like the vessel of the opposite side. It is in relation, in front, with the pleura, the left lung, the pneumogastric, phrenic, and cardiac nerves, which lio parallel with it, the left carotid artery, left internal jugular and innominate veins, and is covered by the Sterno-thyroid, Sterno- hyoid, and Sterno-mastoid muscles; behind, it is in relation with the oesophagus, thoracic duct, inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, Longus colli, and verte- )ra column. To its inner side arc the oesophagus, trachea and thoracic duct; to its outer side, the pleura.

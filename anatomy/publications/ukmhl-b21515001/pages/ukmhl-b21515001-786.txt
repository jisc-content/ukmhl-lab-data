THE THORAX. 652 ventricle forms the greater portion of the anterior surface of the heart, and the left ventricle more of its posterior surface. Each of these cavities should now be separately examined. The Right Auriclh is a little larger than the left, its walls somewhat thinner, measuring about one line; and its cavity is capable of containing about two ounces. It consists of two parts, a principal cavity, or sinus, and an appendix auriculas. The sinus is the large quadrangular cavity, placed between the two vena) cavas: its walls are extremely thin : it is connected below with the right ventricle, and internally with the left auricle, being free in the rest of its extent. 35^-—The Right Auricle and Ventricle laid open, the Anterior Walls of both being removed.

It projects from the sinus forwards and to the left side, overlapping the root of the pulmonary artery. To examine the interior of the auricle, a transverse incision should be made along its ventricular margin, from its right border to the appendix; and from the middle of this, a second incision should be carried upwards, along the inner side of the two venra cavse.

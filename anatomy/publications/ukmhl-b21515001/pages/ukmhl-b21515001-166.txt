The apex of the petrous portion, rough and uneven, is received into the angular interval betweon the spinous process of the sphenoid and the basilar process of the occipital; it presents the anterior or internal orifice of the carotid canal, and forms the posterior and external boundary of the foramen laccrum medium. iho anterior surface of the petrous portion (fig. 31) forms the posterior boundary of the middle fossa of the skull. This surface is continuous with the squamous poi tion, to which it is united by a suture, the temporal suture, the remains of which are distinct even at a lato period of life : it presents six points for examina- tion : 1. an eminence near the centre, which indicates the situation of the superior vertical semicircular canal: 2. on the outer side of this eminence a depression, in- 32.â€”Petrous Portion.

THE SKELETON. 88 ang u. I lie ridge serves for the attachment of a strong aponeurosis, which sepa- i ates .tjjn Infraspinatus from the two Teres muscles. The surface of bone between this i^ji^and the axillary border is narrow in the upper two-thirds of its extent, and traversed near its centre by a groove for the passage of the dorsalis scapula) vossels ; it affords attachment to the Teres minor. Its lower third presents a broader, somewhat triangular surface, which gives origin to the Teres major, and 85.â€”Left Scapula.

The broad and narrow portions of bone above alluded to are separated by an oblique line, which runs from the axillary border, downwards and backwards : to it is attached the aponeurosis separating the two Teres muscles from each other. The Spine is a prominent plate of bone, which crosses obliquely the inner four-fifths of the dorsum of the scapula at its upper part, and separates the

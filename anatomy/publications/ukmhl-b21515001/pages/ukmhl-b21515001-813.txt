THE LUNGS. 679 to the convex surface of the pericardium, and behind, a deep fissure (the liilum pulmonis) which gives attachment to the root of the lung. The posterior border is rounded and broad, and is received in the deep concavity- on either side of the spinal column. It is much longer than the anterior border, and projects below between the ribs and the Diaphragm. 371.—Front View of the Heart and Lungs. The anterior border is thin and sharp, and overlaps the front of the peri- ardium. The anterior border of the right lung corresponds to the median line of the ternum, and is in contact with its fellow, the pleurae being interposed, as low as :ie fourth costal cartilage; below this, the contiguous borders are separated by an ■regularly shaped interval, formed at the expense of the anterior border of tho :ft lung, and in which the pericardium is exposed. Each lung is divided into two lobes, an upper and lower, by a long and deep •ssure, which extends from the upper part of the posterior border of tho organ, lout three inches from its apex, downwards and forwards to the lower part of •3 anterior border. This fissure penetrates nearly to the root. In the right lung ic upper lobe is partially divided by a second and shorter fissure, which extends om the middle of the preceding, forwards and upwards, to the anterior margin the organ, marking off a small triangular portion, the middle lobe. The right lung is the largest; it is broader than the left, owing to the inclina- on of the heart to the left side ; it is also shorter by an inch, in consequence of to Diaphragm rising higher on tho light side to accommodate the liver. The ght lung has three lobes.

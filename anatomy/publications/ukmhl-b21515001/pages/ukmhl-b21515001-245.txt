To the second phalanges, the Flexor sublimis digitorum, Extensor communis digitorum; and, in addition, the Extensor indicis to the index finger, the Extensor minimi digiti to the little finger. To the third phalanges, the Flexor profundus digitorum and Extensor communis digitorum. Development of the Bones of the Hand. The Carpal bones are each developed by a single centre. At birth, they are all cartilaginous. Ossification proceeds in the following order (fig. 96) : in the os magnum and unciform an ossific point appears during the first year, the former preceding the latter; in the cuneiform, at the third year ; in the trapezium and semilunar, at the fifth year, the former preceding the latter; in the scaphoid, at the sixth year ; in the trapezoid, during the eighth year ; and in the pisiform, about the twelfth year. 96.â€”Plan of the Development of the Hand. The Metacarpal bones are each developed by two centres : one for the shaft, and one for the digital extremity, for the four inner metacarpal bones ; one for the shaft, and one for the base, for the metacarpal bone of the thumb, which in this respect resembles the phalanges. Ossification commences in the centre of the shaft about the sixth week, and gradually proceeds to either end of the bone ; about the third year the digital extremities of the four inner metacarpal bones, and

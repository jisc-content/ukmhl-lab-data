THE SKELETON. 54 tlio anteri^j^iferior aiigleyof the lachrymal bone, and by its margins, with tlie groove on the hack of the nasal process of the superior maxillary, and thus assists in forming the lachrymal canal. At the junction of the two middle fourths of the bone, but encroaching on its posterior fourth, a broad thin plate, the ethmoidal process, ascends to join the unciform 53-- prooess of the ethmoid: from the lower border of this process a thin lamina of bone curves downwards and outwards, hooking over the lower edge of the orifice of the antrum, which it narrows below: it is called the maxillary process, and fixes the bone firmly on to the outer wall of the nasal fossa. The inferior border is free, thick and cellular in structure, more especially in the middle of the bone. Both extremities are more is held so that its outer concave the holder), and its superior border, from which the lachrymal and ethmoidal processes project, upwards, the lachrymal process will be directed to the side to which the bone belongs.

The Vomer is a single bone, situated vertically at the back part of the nasal fossae, forming part of the septum of the nose. It is thin, somewhat like a ploughshare in form ; but it varies in different individuals, being frequently bent to one or the other side ; it presents for examination two surfaces and four borders. The lateral surfaces are smooth, marked by small furrows for the lodgment of blood-vessels, and by a groove on each side, sometimes a canal, the naso-palatine, which runs obliquely downwards and forwards to the intermaxillaiy suture between the two ante- rior palatine canals; it trans- mits the naso-palatine nerve. The superior border, the thickest, presents a deep groove, bounded on each side by a horizontal projecting ala of bone : the groove receives the rostrum of the sphenoid, whilst the ala? are overlapped and retained by laminae (the vaginal porcesses) which project from the under surface of the body of the sphenoid at the base of the pterygoid processes. At the front of the groove a fissui’e is left for the transmission of blood-vessels to the substance of the bone. The inferior border, the longest, is broad and uneven 55.—Vomer.

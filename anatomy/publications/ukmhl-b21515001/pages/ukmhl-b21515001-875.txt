74i DEEP PERINEAL FASCIA. Tho superficial and transverse perinseal arteries aro described at p. 402 ; and the superficial perinceal and inferior pudendal nerves at pp. 547, 549. The muscles of the perineeum in the female are, the Sphincter vaginae. Compressor urethrae. Erector clitoridis. Sphincter am. Transversus perinaai. Levator ani. Coccygeus. The Sphincter Vagince surrounds the orifice of the vagina, and is analogous to the Accelerator urinaa in the male. It is attached, posteriorly, to the central tendon of the perineeum, where it blends with the Sphincter ani. Its fibi’es pass forward on each side of the vagina, to be inserted into the corpora cavernosa and body of the clitoris. The Erector Clitoridis resembles the Erector penis in the male, but is smaller than it. The Transversus Perince is inserted into the side of the Sphincter vagince, and the Levator ani into the side of the vagina. The other muscles are precisely similar to those in tho male. The Accelerator urinec. and Erector penis muscles should now be removed, when the deep perinaeal fascia will be exposed, stretching across tho front part of the outlet of the pelvis. The urethra is seen perforating its centre, just behind the bulb; and on either side is the crus penis, connecting the corpus cavernosum with the ramus of the ischium and pubes. 395.—Deep Perinceal Fascia.

It is triangular in shape, about an inch and a half in depth, attached above, by its apex, to the under surface of the symphysis pubis and subpubic ligament; and, on oach side, to the rami of the ischium and pubes, beneath the crura penis.

OF THE BACK. 243 brm a small muscle, which is inserted, by separate tendons, into the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebras, the number varying from four to eight. It is ntimately united with the Semispinalis dorsi, which lies beneath it. The Spinalis Colli is a small muscle, connecting together the spinous processes >f the cervical vertebrae, and analogous to the Spinalis dorsi in the dorsal region, t varies considerably in its size, and in its extent of attachment to the vertebras, lot only in different bodies, but on the two sides of the same body. It usually irises by fleshy or tendinous slips, varying from two to four in number, from the spinous processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebras, and occasionally from the irst and second dorsal, and is inserted into the spinous process of the axis, and iccasionally into the spinous process of the two vertebras below it. This muscle vas found absent in five cases out of twenty-four. The Complexus is a broad thick muscle, situated at the upper and back part sf the neck, beneath the Splenius, and internal to the Transversalis colli and ■ frachelo-mastoid. It arises, by a series of tendons, about seven in number, from lie tips of the transverse processes of the- upper three dorsal and seventh cervical, ind from the articular processes of the three cervical above this. The tendons . miting form a broad muscle, which passes obliquely upwards and inwards, and is : nserted into the innermost depression between the two curved lines of the occi- pital bone. This muscle, about its middle, is traversed by a transverse tendinous : ntersection. The Biventer Cervicis is a small fasciculus, situated on the inner side of the ^receding, and in the majority of cases blended with it; it has received its name rom having a tendon intervening between two fleshy bellies. It is sometimes lescribed as a separate muscle, arising, by from two to four tendinous slips, from ;he transverse processes of as many of the upper dorsal vertebrae, and inserted, on the inner side of the Complexus, into the superior curved line of the occipital oone. Relations. The muscles of the fourth layer are bound down to the vertebrae . ind ribs in the dorsal and lumbar regions by the lumbar fascia and vertebral 1 aponeurosis. The inner part covers the muscles of the fifth layer. In the neck they are in relation, by their superficial surface, with the Trapezius and Splenius ; by their deep surface, with the Semispinalis dorsi and colli and the Recti and 1 Obliqui. The Biventer cervicis is separated from its fellow of the opposite side by the ligamentum nuchae, and the Complexus from the Semispinalis colli by the profunda cervicis artery, the princeps cervicis artery, and by branches of the posterior cervical plexus of nerves. Nerves. The Erector spinm and its subdivisions in the dorsal region are supplied by the external posterior branches of the lumbar and dorsal nerves ; the Cervicalis ascendens, Transversalis colli, Trachelo-mastoid, and Spinalis cervicis, by the external posterior branches of the cervical nerves; the Complexus by the internal posterior branches of the cervical nerves, the suboccipital and great occipital.

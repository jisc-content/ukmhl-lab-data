THIRD VENTRICLE. 487 internal and external geniculate bodies. Its anterior extremity, which is narrow, forms the posterior boundary ol the foramen of Monro. The third ventricle is the narrow oblong fissure placed between the thalami optici, and extending to the baso of the brain. It is bounded, above, by the under ■ surface of the velum interposition, from which are suspended the clioioid plexuses of the third ventricle ; and, laterally, by two whito tracts, one on either side, the peduncles of the pineal gland. Its floor, somewhat oblique in its direction, is formed, from before backwards, by the parts which close the interpeduncular space, 266.—The Third and Fourth Ventricles. viz., the lamina cinerea, the tuber cincrcum and infundibulum, the corpora albi- cantia and the locus perforatus posticus; its sides, by the optic thalami; it is bounded, in front, by the anterior crura of the fornix, and part of the anterior commissure; behind, by the posterior commissure, and the iter a tertio ad quantum ventriculum. The cavity of the third ventricle is crossed by three commissures, named, from their position, anterior} middle, and posterior. The anterior commissure is a rounded cord of white fibres, placed in front of the anterior crura of the fornix. It perforates tlio corpus striatum on either side, and spreads out into the substance of the hemispheres, over the roof of the descending horn of each lateral ventricle. The middle or soft commissure consists almost entirely of grey matter. It connects together the thalami optici, and is continuous with the grey matter lining the anterior part of the third ventricle! It is frequently broken in examining the brain, and might then be supposed to have been wanting.

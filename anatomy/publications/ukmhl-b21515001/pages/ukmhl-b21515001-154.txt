20 THE SKELETON. The Occipital Bone. I lie Occipital ]Jone (fig. 22) is situated at the back part and base of the cranium, is trapezoid in form, curved upon itself, and presents for examination two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. 1 he External Surface is convex. Midway between the summit of the bone and the posterior margin of the foramen magnum is a prominent tubercle, the external occipital protuberance, for the attachment of the Ligament urn nuchas; and descend- ing from it as far as tho foramen, a vertical ridge, the external occipital crest. This tubercle and crest vary in prominence in different skulls. Passing outwards from the occipital protuberance on each side are two semi-circular ridges, tho superior curved lines ; and running parallel with these from the middle of the crest, are the two inferior curved lines. The surface of the bone above the superior curved lines is smooth on each side, and, in the recent state, is covered by the Occipito-frontalis muscle, whilst the ridges, as well as the surface of the bone 22.â€”Occipital Bone. Outer Surface. between them, serve for the attachment of numerous muscles. The superior curved line gives attachment internally - to the Trapezius, externally to the Occipito-frontalis and Sterno-cleido-mastoid, to the extent shown in fig. 22; the depressions between the curved lines to the Complexus interaally, the Splenius capitis and Obliquus capitis superior externally. The inferior curved line, and the depressions below it, afford insertion to the Rectus capitis posticus, major and minor. The foramen magnum is a large oval aperture, its long diameter extending from before backwards. It transmits the spinal cord and its membranes, the spinal accessory nerves, and the vertebral arteries. Its back part is wide for the trans- mission of the cord, and the corresponding margin rough for the attachment of the dura mater enclosing the cord ; the fore part is narrower, being encroached

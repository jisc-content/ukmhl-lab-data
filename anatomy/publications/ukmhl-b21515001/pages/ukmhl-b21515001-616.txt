NERVOUS SYSTEM. 482 number of fibres derived from tlie anterior and posterior lobes which explains the great thickness of the two extremities of this commissure. An incision should now be made through the corpus callosum, on either side of the raphe, when two large irregular-shaped cavities will he exposed, which extend through a great part ol the length ol each hemisphere. These are the lateral ventricles. The lateral ventricles are serous cavities, formed by the upper part of the general ventricular space in the interior of the brain. They are lined by a thin diaphanous lining membrane, covered with ciliated epithelium, and moistened by a serous 264.â€”The Lateral Ventricles of the Brain. fluid, which is sometimes, even in health, secreted in considerable quantitjf. These cavities are two in number, one in each hemisphere, and they are separated from each other by a vertical septum, the septum lucidum. Each lateral ventricle consists of a central cavity, or body, and three smaller cavities or cornua, which extend from it in different directions. The anterior cornu curves forwards and outwards, into the substance of the anterior lobe. The posterior cornu, called the digital cavity, curves backwards into the posterior lobe. The middle cornu descends into the middle lobe. The central cavity, or body of the lateral ventricle, is triangular in form. It is bounded, above, by the under surface of the corpus callosum, which forms the roof of the cavity. Internally, it is a vertical partition, the septum lucidum, which separates it from the opposite ventricle,, and connects the under surface of the corpus callosum with the fornix. Its floor is formed by the following parts, enumerated in their order of position, from before backwards : the corpus striatum,

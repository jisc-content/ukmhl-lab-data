In structure, they resemble the other salivary glands. Tho Ciieeks form the sides of the face, and are continuous in front with the lips. They are composed, externally, of integument; internally, of mucous mem- brane, and between the two, of a muscular stratum, besides a large quantity of fat, areolar tissue, vessels, nerves, and buccal glands. Tho mucous membrane lining the cheek, is reflected above and below upon the gums, and is continuous behind with the lining membrane of the soft palate. Opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw is a papilla, the summit of 319.â€”Sectional View of the Nose, Mouth, Pharynx, etc. which presents the aperture of the duct of the parotid gland. The principal muscle of the cheek is the Buccinator ; but numerous other muscles enter into its formation; viz., the Zygomatici, Masseter, and Blatysma myoides. The buccal glands are placed between the mucous membrane and Buccinator muscle : they are similar in structure to the labial glands, but smaller. Two or three, of larger size than the rest, are placed between the Masseter aud Buccinator muscles ; their ducts open into the mouth, opposite the last molar tooth. They are called m-olcw' glands. The Gums are composed of a dense fibrous tissue, closely connected to the periosteum of the alveolar processes, and surrounding the necks of the teeth. They arc covered by smooth and vascular mucous membrane, which is remarkable for its

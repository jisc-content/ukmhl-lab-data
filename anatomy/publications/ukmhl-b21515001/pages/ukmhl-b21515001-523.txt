SPLENIC. 389 one of which ramifies on its free surface, the other between it and the substance The Splenic Artery, in the adult, is the largest of the three branches of the cceliac axis and is remarkable for the extreme tortuosity of its course. It passes horizontally to the left side behind the upper border of the pancreas, accompanied by tho splenic vein, which lies below it; and on arriving near the spleen, divides 224, The Cceliac Axis and its Branches, the Stomach having been raised, and the Transverse Meso-colon removed. into branches, some of which enter the hilum of that organ to be distributed to its ■ structure, whilst others are distributed to the great end of the stomach. The branches of this vessel are :— Pancreatic® parv®. Gastric (Vasa brevia). Pancreatica magna. Gastro-epiploica sinistra. The pancreatic are numerous small branches derived from the splenic as it runs behind the upper border of the pancreas, supplying its middle and left parts. One of these, larger than the rest, is given off from the splenic near the left extremity of tho pancreas ; it runs from left to right near the posterior surface of the gland, following the course of the pancreatic duct, and is called tho pavcreatica magna. These vessels anastomose with the pancreatic branches of the pancreatico-duodenal arteries. The gastric (yasa brevia') consist of from five to seven small branches, which arise either from the termination of tho splenic artery, or from its terminal

OPHTHALMIC. 353 oblique muscle to the inner angle of the eye, where it divides into two terminal brandies, the frontal, and nasal. Branches. The branches of this vessel may be divided into an orbital group, which are distributed to the orbit and surrounding parts; and an ocular group, which supply tho muscles and globe of the eye. 2i â€™phe Ophthalmic Artery and its Branches, the Hoof ot the Orbit having been removed. Orbital Group. Lachrymal. Supraorbital. Posterior ethmoidal. Anterior ethmoidal. Palpebral. Frontal. Nasal. Ocular Group. Muscular. Anterior ciliary. Short ciliary. Long ciliary. Arteria centralis retinas. The lachrymal is the first, and one of the largest branches, derived from the ophthalmic, arising close to the optic foramen : not unfrcquently it is given off from the artery before it enters the orbit. It accompanies the lachrymal nfervo along the upper border of the External rectus muscle, and iff distributed to' the lachrymal gland. Its terminal branches, escaping from the gland, are distributed to the upper eyelid and conjunctiva, anastomosing with the palpebral arteries. Tho lachrymal artery gives off one or two malar branches ; one of which passes through a foramen in the malar bone, to reach tho temporal fossa, and anastoUioses with the deep temporal arteries. The other appears on tho check, and anasto- moses with the transverse facial. A branch is also sent backwards, through the sphenoidal fissure, to tho dura mater, which anastomoses with a branch 6f tho middle meningeal artery. A A

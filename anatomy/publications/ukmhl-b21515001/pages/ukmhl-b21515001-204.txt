THE SKELETON. 70 the opening of the anterior nares, which is heart-shaped, with the narrow end upwards, and presents laterally the thin sharp margins serving for the attachment of the lateral cartilages of the nose, and in the middle line below, a prominent process, the anterior nasal spine, bounded by two deep notches. Below this is the intermaxillary suture, and on each side of it the incisive fossa. Beneath this fossa is the alveolar process of the upper and lower jaw, containing the incisor teeth, and at the lower part of the median line, the symphysis of the chin, the mental eminence, and the incisive fossa of the lower jaw. On each side, proceeding from above downwards, is the supraorbital ridge, terminating externally in the external angular process at its junction with the malar, and internally in the internal angular process ; towards the inner third of 65.â€”Anterior Region of the Skull. this ridge is the supraorbital notch or foramen, for the passage of the supra- orbital vessels and nerve, and at its inner side a slight depression for the attach- ment of the pulley of the Superior oblique muscle. Beneath the supraorbital ridge is the opening of the orbit, bounded externally by the orbital ridge of the malar bone; below, by the orbital ridge formed by the.malar, superior maxillary, and lachrymal bones; internally, by the nasal process of the superior maxillary, and the internal angular process of the frontal bone. On the outer side of the orbit, is the quadrilateral anterior surface of the malar bone, perforated by one or two small malar foramina. Below the inferior margin of the orbit, is the infra- orbital foramen, the termination of the infraorbital canal, and beneath this, the canine fossa, which gives attachment to the Levator anguli oris ; bounded below

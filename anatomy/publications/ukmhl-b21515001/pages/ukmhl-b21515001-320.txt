186 ARTICULATIONS. I. Hip-Joint. (Fig. 138.) This articulation is an enarthrodial, or ball-and-socket joint, formed by the reception of the head of the femur into the cup-shaped cavity of the acetabulum. The articulating surfaces arc covered with cartilage, that on tho head of the femur Actions. Tho movements which occur in these joints are flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction ; the lateral movements are very limited. XI. Articulations of the Phalanges. These aro ginglymus joints, connected by the following ligaments : — Anterior. Two Lateral. The arrangement of these ligaments is similar to those in the metacarpo-pha- langeal articulations ; the extensor tendon supplies the place of a posterior ligament. Actions. The only movements permitted in the phalangeal joints are flexion and extension; these movements are more extensive between the first and second phalanges than between the second and third. The movement of flexion is very considerable, but the extension is limited by the anterior and lateral ligaments. ARTICULATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The articulations of the Lower Extremity comprise the following groups :—I. The hip-joint. II. The knee-joint. III. The articulations between the tibia and fibula. IY. The ankle-joint. Y. The articulations of the tarsus. VI. The tarso-metatarsal articulations. VII. The metatarso-phalangeal articulations. VIII. The articulations of the phalanges. 13S.—Left Ilip-Joint laid open.

ARTERIES. oo- +1.fn, t0 ftPP^ a ligature to this vessel, the patient is to be placed upon his back wUu the shoulders raised, and the head bent a little backwards, so as to dX out Te J trom behind the sternum into the neck.

Iiom this point, a second incision is carried about the same length alone- il, upper border of the clavicle. The skin is then dissected back, and the Platysma divided on a director: the sternal end of the Sterno-mastoid is now brought infi/view and a director being passed beneath it and close to its under surface, so as to avoid any small vessels, the muscle is to be divided transversely throughout the greater part of its attach inent. By. pressing aside any loose cellular tissue or vessels that may now appear the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles will be exposed, and must be divided, XiXtor being previously passed beneath them. The inferior thyroid veins now come into view and must be caiefully drawn either upwards or downwards, by means of a blunt hook. On no account should these vessels be divided, as it would add much to the difficulty of the opera- ion, and endanger its ultimate success. After tearing through a strong fibro-ceJlular .annua, the right, carotid is brought into view, and being traced downwards, the arteria innominata is arrived at. Ihe left vena innominata should now be depressed, the right % ena innominata, ^e internal jugular vein, and pneumogastric nerve drawn to the rmht side • and a curved aneurism needle may then be passed around the vessel, close to its surface, and m a direction from below upwards and inwards; care being taken to avoid the right pleural sac, the trachea, and cardiac nerves. The ligature should be applied to the artery as high as possible, in order to allow room between it and the aorta for the formation of a coagulum Ihe importance of avoiding the thyroid plexus of veins during the primary steps of the oper£ tion, and the pleural sac whilst including the vessel in the ligature, should be most carefully borne m mind, since secondary hamiorrhage or pleurisy have been the cause of death in all the cases hitherto operated on. Common Carotid Arteries. The common carotid arteries, although occupying a nearly similar position in the neck, differ in position, and, consequently, in their relations at their origin. The right carotid arises from the arteria innominata, behind the right sterno- clavicular articulation ; the left from the highest part of the arch of the aorta. The left carotid is, consequently, longer and placed more deeply in the thorax. It will, therefore, be more convenient to describe first the course and relations of that portion of the left carotid which intervenes between the arch of the aorta and the left sterno-clavicular articulations (see fig. 205). The left carotid within the thorax ascends obliquely outwards from the arch of the aorta to the root of the neck. In front, it is separated from the first piece of the sternum by the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, the left innominate vein, and the remains of the thymus gland; behind, it lies on the trachea,-oeso- phagus, and thoracic duct. Internally, it is in relation with the arteria innomi- nata ; externally, with the left pneumogastric nerve, and left subclavian artery. Plan of the Relations of the Left Common Carotid.

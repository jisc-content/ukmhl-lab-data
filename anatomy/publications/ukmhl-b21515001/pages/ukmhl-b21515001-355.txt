SUPERFICIAL CERVICAL REGION. 221 This muscle divides the quadrilateral space at the side of the neck into two triangles, an anterior and a posterior. The boundaries of the anterior triangle are in front the median line of the neck ; above, the lower border of the body of the iaw5 and an imaginary line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process â€¢ behind, the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid muscle. The boundaries of the posterior triangle are, in front, the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid ; below, the upper border of the clavicle; behind, the anterior margin of tlio Trapezius.* i Muscles of the Neck, and Boundaries of the Tiiangles. The anterior edge of the muscle forms a very prominent ridge beneath the skin, which it is important to notice, as it forms a guide to the surgeon in making the necessary incisions for ligature of the common carotid artery, and for cesoph agotomy. Relations. By its superficial surface, with the integument and Platysma, from which it is separated by the external jugular vein, the superficial branches of the cervical plexus, and the anterior layer of the deep cervical fascia. By its deep surface, it rests on the sterno-clavicular articulation, the deep layer of the cervical fascia, the Sterno-liyoid, Sterno-thyroid, Omo-hyoid, the posterior belly of the Digastric, Levator anguli scapulas, the Splenius and Scaleni muscles. Below, it is in relation with the lower part of the common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, pneumogastric, descendens noni and oommunicans noni nerves, and with the deep lymphatic glands; with the spinal accessory nerve, which pierces its upper third, the cervical plexus, the occipital artery, and a part of the parotid gland. Nerves. The Platysma myoides is supplied by the facial and superficial cervical Hie anatomy of these triangles will he more exactly described with that of the vessels of the neck.

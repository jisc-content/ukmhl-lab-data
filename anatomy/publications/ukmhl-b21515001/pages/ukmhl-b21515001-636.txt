502 CRANIAL NERVES. Tho Tympanic branch arises from the nerve opposite the pyramid ; it is a small filament, which supplies tho Stapedius and Laxator tympani muscles. Tho Chorda tympani is given off from the facial as it passes vertically down- wards at the back of tho tympanum, about a quarter of an inch before its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen. It ascends from below upwards in a distinct canal, parallel with the aquoeductus Fallopii, and enters tho cavity of the tym- panum through an opening between the base of the pyramid and the attachment of the membrana tympani, and becomes invosted with mucous membrane. It 275-â€”The Nerves of the Scalp, Face, and Side of the Neck. passes forwards through the cavity of the tympanum, between the handle of the malleus and vertical ramus of the incus, to its anterior inferior angle, and emerges from that cavity through a foramen (the canal of Huguier) at the inner side of the Glaserian fissure. It then descends between, the two Pterygoid muscles, and meets the gustatory nerve at an acute angle, after communicating with which, it accompanies it to the submaxillary gland ; it then joins the submaxillary ganglion, and terminates in the Lingualis muscle. The Posterior auricular nerve ai'ises close to the stylo-mastoid foramen, and passes upwards in front of the mastoid process, Avhere it is joined by a filament from the auricular branch of the pneumogastric, and communicates with the deep branch of the auricularis magnus; as it descends between the meatus and mastoid

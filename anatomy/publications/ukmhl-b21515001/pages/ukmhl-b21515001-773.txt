STRUCTURE OF LIVER. 639 They are small gi'anulai* bodies, about the size of a millet-seed, measuring from one-twentieth to one-tenth of an inch in diameter. If divided longitudinally, they have a foliated, and, if transversely, a polygonal, outline. The bases of tlio lobules are clustered round the smallest branches (sublobular) of the hepatic veins, to which each if connected by means of a small branch, which issues from the centre of the lobule (intra- 346. lobular). The remaining part of the sur- face of each lobule is imperfectly isolated from the surrounding lobules, by a thin stratum of areolar tissue, and by the smaller vessels and ducts. If one of the hepatic veins be laid open, the bases of the lobules may be seen through the thin wall of the vein, on which they rest, arranged in the form of a tesselated pavement, the centre of each polygonal space presenting a mi- nute aperture, the mouth of a sublobular vein. Each lobule is composed of a mass of cells ; of a plexus of biliary ducts; of a venous plexus, formed by branches of the portal vein ; of a branch of an he- patic vein (intralobular) ; of minute arteries; and, probably, of nerves and lymphatics. The hepatic cells form the chief mass of the substance of a lobule, and lie in the interspaces of the capillary plexus, being probably contained in a tubular network, which forms the origin of the biliary ducts. The smallest branches of the vena portee pass between the lobules, around which they form a plexus, the intei’lobular. Branches from this plexus enter the lobules, and form a network in their circumference. The radicles of the portal vein communicate with those of the hepatic vein, which occupy the centre of the lobule ; and the latter converge to form the intralobular vein, which issues from the base of the lobule, and joins the hepatic vein. The portal vein carries the blood to the liver, from which the bile is secreted ; the hepatic vein carries the superfluous blood from the liver, and the bile-duct carries the bile secreted by the hepatic cells. The hepatic cells are of a moro or less spheroidal form; but may be rounded, flattened, or many-sided, from mutual compression. They vary in size from the "vonju to the 3^ 0^0 0 ef an inch m dia- meter, and contain a distinct nucleus in the interior, or sometimes two. In the nucleus is a highly refracting nucleolus, with granules. The cell-contents aro viscid, and contain yellow particles, the colouring matter of the bile, and oil-globules. The cells adhere together by the H. Longitudinal section of an hepatic vein. a.

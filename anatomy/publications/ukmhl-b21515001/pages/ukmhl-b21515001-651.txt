5i7 SPINAL ACCESSORY. the Digastric. It arises from the trunk of the nerve below the petrous ganglion, and joins the facial just after its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen. The tympanic branch (Jacobson’s nerve) arises from tho petrous ganglion and enters a small bony canal at the base of the petrous portion of tho temporal bone; the lower opening of which is situated on the bony ridge which separates the carotid canal from the jugular fossa. Jacobson’s nerve ascends to the tym- panum, enters that cavity by an aperture in its floor close to the inner wall, and divides into three branches, which are contained in grooves upon the surface of the promontory. Its branches of distribution are, one to the fenestra rotunda, one to the fenestra ovalis, and one to the lining membrane of the Eustachian tube and tympanum. Its branches of communication are three, and occupy separate grooves on the surface of the promontory. One of these arches forwards and downwards to the cai’otid canal to join the carotid plexus. A second runs vertically upwards to join the greater superficial petrosal nerve, as it lies in the hiatus Fallopii. The third branch, the lesser petrosal, runs upwards and forwards towards the anterior surface of the petrous bone, and passes through a small aperture in the sphenoid and tem- poral bones, to the exterior of the skull, where it joins the otic ganglion. This nerve, in its course through the temporal bone, passes by the ganglionic enlarge- ment of the facial, and has a connecting filament with it. The branches of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve are the carotid, pharyngeal, mus- cular, tonsillar, and lingual. The carotid branches descend along the trunk of the internal carotid artery as\ p. far as its point of bifurcation, communicating with the pharyngeal branch of the ]' N V pneumogastric, and with branches of the sympathetic. The pharyngeal branches are three or four filaments which unite opposite the Middle constrictor of the pharynx with the pharyngeal branches of the pneumo- gastric, superior laryngeal, and sympathetic nerves, to form the pharyngeal plexus branches from which perforate the muscular coat of the pharynx to supply the mucous membrane. * .J The muscular branches are distributed to the Stylo-pharyngeus.^f* The tonsillar branches supply the tonsil, forming a plexus (circularis tonsillaris), around this oody, from which branches are distributed to the soft palate and fauces, where they anastomose with the palatine nerves. The lingual branches are two in number; one supplies the mucous membrane covering the surface of the base of the tongue, the other perforates its substance, and supplies the mucous membrane and papillas of the side of the organ. The Spinal Accessory Nerve consists of two parts : one, the accessory part to the vagus, and the other the spinal portion. The accessory part, the smallerofthe two, arises by four- or five delicate filaments from the lateral tract of the«sw be 1 ow the roots of the vagus ; these filaments may be traced to a nucleus of grey matter at the back of the medulla, below the origin of the vagus. It joins, in the jugular foramen, with the upper ganglion of the vagus by one or two filaments, and is continued into the vagus below the second ganglion. It gives branches to tho pharyngeal and superior laryngeal branches of the vagus. The spinal portieni, firm in texture, arises by several filaments from the lateral tract of the cord, as low down as the sixth cervical nerve; the fibres pierce the tract, and are connected with the anterior horn of the grey matter of the cord. Ibis portion of the nerve ascends between the ligamentum dentieulatum and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, enters tho skull through the foramen magnum, and it is then directed outwards to tho jugular foramen, through which it passes, lyino *n fhe same sheath as the pneumogastric, separated from it by a fold of the arachnoid, and is here connected with tho accessory portion. At its exit from the jugular foramen, it passes backwards behind the internal jugular vein, and descends obliquely behind the Digastric and Stylo-hyoid muscles to tho upper part of the

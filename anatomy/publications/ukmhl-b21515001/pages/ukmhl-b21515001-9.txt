PREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION. TN THIS EDITION the old description of the Cochlea, which had been allowed to remain uncorrected by an oversight, has been modified so as to embrace the essential points of recent discoveries in the structure of the internal ear. For the figures illustrating this description the Editor is indebted to his friend, Mr. C. Stewart, Curator of the Museum of St. Thomasâ€™s Hospital, as well as for one to replace an erroneous diagram of the minute structure of the large intestine. The account of the actions of some of the larger joints has also been made somewhat fuller ; a few new figures have been added, and the errors of the press have been still further corrected. Iu other respects this Edition is a reprint of the former. 31 Claudes Street: July 1872.

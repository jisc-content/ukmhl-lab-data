722 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF INGUINAL HERNIA. direction is curved towards the thigh, whore it is continuous with the fascia lata. Its outer half is rounded, oblique in its direction, and continuous with the iliac fascia. Its inner half gradually widens at its attachment to the pubes, is more horizontal in dii’ection, and lies beneath tho spermatic cord. Gimbernat's ligament is that portion of the aponeurosis of tho External oblique which is inserted into the pectineal line; it is thin, membranous in structure, triangular in shape, the base directed outwards, and passes upwards and backwards beneath the spermatic cord, from the spine of the os pubis to the pectineal line, to the extent of about half an inch. The triangular ligament is a band of tendinous fibres, of a triangular shape, which is continued from Poupart’s ligament at its attachment to the pectineal line upwards and inwards, behind the inner pillar of the external ring to the linea alba. The Internal oblique Muscle has been described (p. 248). The part which is now exposed is partly muscular and partly tendinous in structure. Those fibres which arise from the outer part of Poupart’s ligament are thin, pale in colour, curve downwards, and terminate in an aponeurosis, which passes in front of the Rectus and Pyramidalis muscles, to be inserted into the crest of the os pubis and 386.—Inguinal Hernia, showing the Internal Oblique, Cremaster, and Spermatic Canal. pectineal lino, to the extent of half an inch, in common with that of the Trans- versalis muscle, forming by their junction tho conjoined tendon. This tendon is placed immediately behind Gimbernat’s ligament and the external abdominal ring, and serves to strengthen what would otherwise bo a very weak point in the abdominal wall. When a direct inguinal hernia passes through the external ring, the conjoined tendon usually forms one of its coverings. Tho Cremaster is a slender muscular fasciculus, which arises from the middle of

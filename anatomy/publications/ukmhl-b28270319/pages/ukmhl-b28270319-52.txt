10 fully accordant they are with the position that the enamel is provided with an animal basisâ€”a view my microscopic investigations had already corro- borated by various appearances.* Having thus uniformly found appearances de- noting cells or compartments in all these states and stages, I became doubly eager to investigate the structure of the pulp, with a view to discover the nature of the process by which this cellular struc- ture is produced, and the source from which it is derived. I might now enter upon a description of the organization of the pulp, and its relation to the process in question ; but as this is a subject of purely anatomical detail, I consider that it falls more particularly under the cognizance of the me- dical section of the association. Suffice it here to state, that the pulp is cellular throughout its en- tire structure, as may be seen from the series of diagrams placed before you, marked Structure of the Pulp, and Developement of Ivory, Nos. 1 to 16, (and contained in Plates C. 6, C. 7, C. 8, &, C. 9.)t I at first experienced great difficulty in sub- mitting: to minute examination the surface of the pulp; that is to say, that portion of it where its transition into ivory takes place; but I at length * To this table considerable additions have since been made, which are not yet completed; and I therefore, in justice to its eminent author, withhold it, until I am enabled to publish it in a perfect state. To avoid repetition, I beg to refer to the next Memoir, p. 27, for a description of these diagrams.

34 arise in it, and at last nerves also. On the surface the globules are more regularly arranged, and more longitudinally extended, and turned in an external direction under right or slightly acute angles. â€œ These longitudinally drawn out globules are plainly cylindrical cells. They contain very evidently in recent (fresh) teeth the characteristic cellular nucleus with its nucleus-corpuscles, and are very similar to the prisms of the enamel membrane. The interior of the pulp consists of round cells, also with a nucleus, and between these cells run vessels and nerves. If we draw the pulp of a young tooth out of its cavity, and then examine the dental sub- stance, whether deprived or not of its calcareous salts by muriatic acid, we shall find on its internal surface, at any rate inferiorly, where the already formed dental substance is still thin and soft,a layer of the cylindrical cells of the pulp. These have about the same thickness as the solid fibres of the dental substance, and also the same course; and inasmuch as they, on the one hand, plainly belong to the pulp, on account of their conformity with the cylindrical cells adhering to the remaining surface of the pulp, and, on the other hand, as they cohere more firmly with the dental substance than with the pulp, and remain attached to the former, I presume that here a transition takes place, and that the cylindric cells of the pulp are only the fibres of the tooth in their first stage, and change into the latter by filling with organic

45 In the interior of this alveolar epithelium, where it corresponds to the molar teeth, small vesicles may be frequently observed, varying in size from one quarter to one-eighth of a line in diameter. They appear to the naked eye to be transparent; under the microscope their parietes are found to consist of attenuated scales, and their cavity to contain a fluid abounding in minute granules and cells.* The internal surface of the epithelium covering the alveolar arch frequently presents con- cavities or indentations which are from a line and a half to three or four lines in circumference : they correspond to projections from the mucous mem- brane formed by a larger species of vesicle. The latter is deeply implanted in the vascular mucous membrane. The parietes of these vesicles are composed of a very delicate membrane ; they con- tain a transparent fluid which coagulates on the application of heat, or acid, or on immersion in spirit, and in this fluid float numerous globules and scales similar to those of the epithelium gene- rally. The internal or attached surface of the alveolar epithelium also presents numerous fringed processes measuring from one line to one and a half lines in length, and half a line in breadth, which sink into the substance of the subjacent mucous membrane. Under the microscope these * The vesicles here alluded to are most probably those which Serres describes as glands for the secretion of tartar: they are very numerous even after the extrusion of the incisor teeth of the calf, and are seen with great facility internally.

14 Â» lowing subjects : 1st. on the Covering of the Enamel : 2ndly, I will communicate my own views on the Structure of Teeth ; and 3rdly, I will treat succinctly of the Structure of the Pulp, and its rela- tion to the developement of the ivory. The researches of Retzius and Purkinje, so faith- fully detailed to you last year, have established that there enters into the composition of the simple and compound teeth of man and mammalia generally, not only ivory and enamel, but a third substance, the crusta petrosa, which had been noticed pre- viously on the free surface of the compound teeth of graminivorous animals. The crusta petrosa, as existing on simple teeth, was described to you, after Retzius, Purkinje, and Frankel, as a layer extertial to the ivory of the fang, but as not present on these simple teeth as a covering to the enamel. I should here mention, however, that Purkinje and Frankel state, that they had once noticed it coating partially the enamel on the tooth of an old man. My researches, however, have led me to the convic- tion, that the enamel itself possesses in all instances a distinct envelope or coating. On the incisor of the calf and several other simple teeth, I have also distinctly traced in this layer of crusta petrosa, superimposed on the enamel, the corpuscles of Purkinje, analogous to those found in bone. I possess preparations of teeth of the human subject, and simple teeth of the herbivora and carnivora, showing this structure in a clear and unequivocal form. The details of its discovery and of its anato-

41 nute bodies which constitute the epithelium. An interesting subject of investigation, and one which I believe has not been entered upon by those who have hitherto treated of this department of anato- mical science, is the manner in which the compo- nent parts of the epithelium are connected. The cells on the surface of the mucous membrane are separated from each other by considerable spaces, which are occupied by a gelatinous substance, in- terspersed with minute granular bodies. But the scales forming superficial layers of the epithelium are separated by very minute linear spaces, but are still connected together by a translucent, gelatinous substance. This latter displays considerable elasticity, as is easily rendered evident by an attempt to lacerate the epithelium in a moist state, if the latter be ex- amined at the same time by the aid of a mag- nifying power. Each time that the laceration is attempted, the membrane yields, and the scales separate to a certain extent; but regain their ori- ginal position, on the cessation of the effort to draw them apart. In some instances a fibrous structure is evident in the gelatinous substance between the scales, See Diagram, No. 3. (PI. C. 10.) The scales towards the free surface are distinctly observed to overlap. The gelatinous substance above alluded to, presents distinct granular bodies, which give to the epithelium, en masse, a rather dense aspect, the individual scales being sometimes covered by these granules; the latter can, however.

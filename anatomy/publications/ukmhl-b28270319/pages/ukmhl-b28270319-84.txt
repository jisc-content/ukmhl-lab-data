42 be separated from the scales by compression; by which means, indeed, the granules themselves may be made entirely to disappear. In certain parts of the epithelium of the calf, distinct fibres are observed, which pass over the surface of the scales, and con- nect them together, thus forming a very delicate net-work. This appearance is most evident upon compression of the thick epithelium on the anterior part of the alveolar arch of the upper jaw. In these cases, where the small scales, or small clusters of scales, are being continually thrown off, as on the surface of the body, and of the mucous membranes of man and animals generally, the scales composing the external layer will be found to overlap each other, and thus the gradual pres- sure of scales below, which are increasing in size, is the cause of the throwing off of these cuticular lamellae. After these have been detached, their place is occupied by newly-formed scales. But there is another form in which the external layer of cuticle is removed, viz. in a continuous layer. The cuticle of the frog is composed of minute scales, the borders of which do not overlap, but are held in direct apposition, so as to form one lamina, which has a beautiful continuous tesselated appear- ance. This layer, of which I here display consi- derable portions covering the whole body, is thrown off entire by frogs and efts; and I am disposed to believe that it is this covering which, according to naturalists, is swallowed by the animal after having been thrown offâ€˜. As soon as this layer is

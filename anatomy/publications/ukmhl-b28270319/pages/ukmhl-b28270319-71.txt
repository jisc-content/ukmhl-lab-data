29 It appears to me that the framework of the reti- culation, or cells of the pulp, constitutes the fibres of the tooth, which, while in this state, are spirally coiled, and fit into one another. At all events, the diameter of these fibres of the reticulations is pre- cisely that of the fibres of the ivory; the points or projections rising from the framework correspond to the centres of the cells, and may be traced to belong to their structure. [The fibres composed of granules of animal matter, and which I describe as the framework of the reticulations, become, upon the deposition of ossific matter within the cellules of those reticulations, the fibres of the ivory. The only change which they appear to undergo during the process of transition, is, that they are then drawn out from the coiled-up state in which they exist between the collapsed cells of the reticulations into the more longitudinal but still spiral form in which they are found in the ivory. This will be fully understood by an examination of the dia- gram [PI. C. 9.] No. 15.] The fibres of the ivory are frequently very spirally curved, like those of the pulp, and as we should conclude they must be from the manner of their evolution, as seen in diagram. Ivory, No. 8.* Pulp No. 15, [PI. C. 9], shows the appearances presented by a portion of a recent tooth, which has been submitted to the action of acid. Part of the pulp is visible in con- * This I cannot give in the present publication ; it is of no essential importance.

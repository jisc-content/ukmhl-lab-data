16 terrupted or baccated appearance, as if they were made up of different compartments. The size and relative positions of these portions or divisions of a fibre differ in various series of animals. In the human subject, for instance, each compartment of the fibre is of an oval shape, and its long, small extremity is in apposition to the one next adjoin- ing. The long axis of the oval corresponds with the course of the fibre. In some species of the monkey tribe the fibre appears to be composed of two rows of compartments parallel to each other, and a trace of the same appearance is evident even in some of the principal ramifications of the fibres. In the orang utan the fibre is composed of rhom- boidal divisions, and in the baboon they are oval like those of the human subject, and the surfaces of the long axis are in apposition. Some of the ap- pearances are seen in the diagrams [PI. C. 5,] marked ivory fibres, Nos. 3 to 6, where the ap- pearances of the fibres of the orang utan, loris, mandril, and cynocephalus, are shown. When teeth are submitted to the action of acid, for a period long enough to allow the earthy matter to be all taken up, I find that the animal residue consists of solid fibres, and if the decom- position be allowed to continue, these fibres present a peculiar baccated appearance. The drawings marked. Ivory deprived of Earth, [PI. C. 6,] Nos. 1 to 4, show these appearances. [No. I shows the appearance of the ivory when the earthy matter has been almost entirely re-

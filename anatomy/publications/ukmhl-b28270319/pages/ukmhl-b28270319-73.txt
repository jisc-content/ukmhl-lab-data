31 theories, though I still venture to think that, were not my limits confined, I could easily show how what I hold to be fallacies and incongruities have arisen. As, for instance, from want of practice in the manipulation of materials, the precise nature of which has not been attended to : want of familiarity with microscopic appearances; ocular deception; the want of a well-defined magnifying power, and imperfect light in the microscope used, have been doubtless, also, causes of many of the conflicting conclusions to which almost all inquiries in this region of anatomy have arrived. I think that the view I have taken of the subject more satisfactorily explains than any other, facts of daily experience. The laminated arrangement of the osseous cells explains the concentric fracture of the tusks of the mammoth, and of other teeth, when left to decom- pose spontaneously. The cells being in imbricated apposition, and held together by earthy salts, being moreover arranged in layers conformably with the periphery of the pulp, must be regarded as concen- trically laminated. The existence of this structure explains the phenomena daily noticed by ivory- cutters, and also Mr. Hunterâ€™s experiments of feeding animals with madder, the result of which is incompatible with any other theory of the struc- ture of dental bone. No view hitherto taken of the structure of dental bone has afforded a satisfactory explanation of the ordinary morbid appearances of the tooth, but many of these I think may be explained, if we

6 before you, are brought forward merely with a view to establish the general principle, that the organiza- tion of the dental bone is cellular, and they have been selected more from convenience at the mo- ment, and as demonstrating the variety of cellular conformation existing in the teeth throughout the wide range of the animal kingdom, than with any intention of establishing at once a complete and systematic view of the subject. I have also made researches into the structure and composition of the fibres of different teeth, and have generally found that these present an in- terrupted or baccated appearance, as if they were made up of different compartments,â€”an obvious concomitant of the cellular structure of the inter- fibrous material. The size and relative position of these portions or divisions of a fibre differ in va- rious series of animals. In the human subject, for instance, each compartment of the fibre is of an oval shape, and its long small extremity is in ap- position to the one next adjoining. The long axis of the oval corresponds with the course of the fibre. In some species of the monkey tribe the fibre ap- pears to be composed of two rows of compartments parallel to each other. In the orang utan the fi I ire is composed of rhoraboidal divisions, and in the baboon they are oval like those of the human subject, and the surfaces of the long axes are in apposition. In fact, each class of animals seems to have a distinct characteristic appearance, but all are similar in respect to the general baccated

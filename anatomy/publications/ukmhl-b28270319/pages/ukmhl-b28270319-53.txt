11 succeeded in obtaining a clear view of it, and found it to present the beautifully interestingreticulated cel- lular appearance which is represented in the series of drawings marked Pulp, Nos. 6 to 16, [PI. C. 7, 8, and 9,] where the oells of the pulp in a state of tran- sition are coloured blue, and those ossified are co- loured yellow. Having ascertained that this reticular conforma- tion was constant in all the pulps which I examined, I proceeded to study it with confidence, and soon found that it was essentially concerned in the pro- cess of the developement of the ivory, and in the production of the fibres of the latter, as well as of the interfibrous substance. Of this part of ray subject I intend to treat more at length before the medical section, but some idea of the different stages of the formation of dental bone may be gained from an examination of the series of diagrams above alluded to, showing the transition of the cells of this reticular surface into the cells of the ivory. Conceiving that there existed a great analogy in the productions of the capsule and the pulp, I searched for the appearances displayed by the in- ternal or productive surface of that membrane, and found them analogous to the external or productive surface of the pulp, as shown in the drawing, [PI. C. 11,] No. 6. The membranous investment which I lately dis- covered as investing the enamel of the teeth of man and other simple teeth, displays a similar arrange- ment.

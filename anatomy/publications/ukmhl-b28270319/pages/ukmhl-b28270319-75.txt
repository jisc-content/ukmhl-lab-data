33 however, that he is ignorant of the process of tran- sition, and he regards the dental pulp as a simple cartilage. In fact, he starts with a ready-made hypothesis, and founds his opinion rather on the observations of others, and on the inferences he draws from them, than on his own actual re- searches : with respect to what he himself gives as his own, it accords for the most part with the details I have just communicated. The following is the account contained in his work on the structure and function of the pulp. “ According to Purkinje and Raschkow, the pulp consists at first of nearly uniform globules, without vessels and nerves; afterwards, vessels emphatic statement of September 1839, ‘that so far from being the ossified pulp, it (the dental substance) was altogether a dis- tinct formation.’ Now of this passage, which he gives as quoted from the Literary Gazette, p. 598, only the four last words will be found, on reference to that journal,” (and to the ori- ginal paragraph itself in the paper above,) “ to be correctly copied: all the first part of the passage is the composition of Mr. Owen. Mr. Nasmyth, by this perversion of his report, is made to say that the dental substance is altogether a distinct forma- tion : whereas he never mentions the dental substance at all, and his real meaning evidently is, as we have shown above that the cells of the ivory have undergone a distinct formative process in their transition from the cells of the pulp. Such unfair and unworthy tactics must inevitably defeat the purpose for which they were adopted. Mr. Owen's unscrupulous vio- lence, far from concealing, as he seems to calculate it may do, the weakness of his arguments, will only still further damage his cause, in the eyes of every dispassionate reader.”—Medical Gazette for July 3, 1840. 1)

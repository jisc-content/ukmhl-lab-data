ing, in the particular diagram alluded to, that there were several leaf-like processes, which T could not help com- paring, in my own mind, with some of the fan-like coral- lines, which were coloured partly blue and partly yellow : you observed that the artist had in all the diagrams pre- served the same colour for similar structures; thus, in all, the yellow represented the ivory, and the blue the pulp. Upon being struck with the exact resemblance be- tween the yellow and blue portions of this drawing, we were informed that in the lighter parts (yellowish) the pulp cells were in a transition stage of change into ivory ; and in those more deeply tinted yellow, that change had been completed; and that the original curiously-arranged pulp cells had been converted into bone. There were several other diagrams more or less demonstrative of this fact, but I well remember to have considered, at that time, that this particular diagram distinctly demonstrated the facts you then tried to impress upon us, because of its representing in one view the successive changes from original pulp cells into the complete ivory of the tooth. My memory does not serve me as to whether the drawing was made from the human or some animal’s tooth, but I satisfied myself of the correctness of the artist as to the arrangement of the cells and the reticulations, by an ex- amination of a preparation which was placed under the microscope in another part of the room, which I examined immediately after Sir Astley Cooper, who expressed him- self satisfied of the fidelity of your artist.

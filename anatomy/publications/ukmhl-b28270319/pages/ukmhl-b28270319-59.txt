17 moved by acid, but where the cells still retain their positic^, general appearance, and connexion with each other. Diagram No. 2, represents a more advanced stage of decomposition, where there seem to be attached to each fibre minute lateral filaments, which I presume to be the remaining portions of the emptied cells. Diagrams No. 3, and No. 4, depict the appear- ances presented when decomposition has so far advanced as to have rendered the fibre interrupted or baccated. No. 3, represents the fibre of a human tooth, and No. 4, that of the elephant in this state. It maybe useful to compare these cells in No. 1, after they have been deprived of their earthy con- tents, with their state previous to the reception of the earthy matter as delineated in pulp No. 6, A. &c. [PI. C. 7 and 8.] In the reticulations they are collapsed, lying one above another, but after having- been deprived of earth, they will be observed to be rigid, and to retain the erect distended form which they acquired by the deposition within them of ossific matter.*] * To indicate the true theory of the formation of ivory, nothing more is required than the display of these appearances. No “ ex- creted” or “ exuded” substance can possibly present an animal tissue arranged in regular connected cells. It is quite evident that these cells, whilst receiving a supply of earthy matter during the process of transition, must remain in connection with, and in- deed continue to form part of, the pulp. It would be absurd to suppose that a regularly cellular structure can be “ excreted C

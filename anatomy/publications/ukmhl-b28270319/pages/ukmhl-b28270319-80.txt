38 less, to state concisely all the results of my investi- gations. Leeuwenhoek, who did so much towards the ad- vancement of structural anatomy, was the first to give an accurate account of the structure of the epithelium. His researches on this subject are con- tained in letters to the Royal Society in the years 1674, 1684-85, which will be found in the third and fourth volumes of his collected works. He there states, that the human epidermis and epithe- lium are composed of scales, and of these he has left very accurate descriptions and delineations. He spoke of the scales of the epithelium as existing upon the mucous membrane of the mouth. The researches of subsequent observers tend to prove that these scales or cells exist in various forms upon the surface of all mucous and serous membranes, upon the inner membrane of the vascular system, &c. With respect to the existence of these scales on almost all these membranes, I agree wdth the autho- rities whom I have just quoted; and having pre- mised thus much, I shall now proceed to treat, firstly, of the structure of the epithelium generally ; and, secondly, of the epithelium as existing in the cavity of the mouth. Structure of the Epithelium generally. â€” The epithelium is a layer of substance destitute of vessels, which covers the vascular surface of mu- cous membranes. Though destitute of vessels, it cannot, however, be considered as inorganic, as I shall presently show. If the surface of a mucous

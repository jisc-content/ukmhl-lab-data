28 from the surface of the pulp beneath. The portions coloured blue are cells of the pulp as yet unossified, and the parts coloured yellow are either entire lay- ers of ossified pulp-cells, or fragments of ivory which have remained adherent to the pulp, or extravasated fluid, containing probably osseous matter, (See [PL C. 8.] Nos. 11 and 12.) The whole appear- ances denote the existence of a peculiar system of cells external to the peripheral ramifications of the blood-vessels, the functions of which are highly interesting, and the study of which will ultimately lead, I think, to the unveiling of many vital pro- cesses connected with the growth of animal tissues, which are at present shrouded in obscurity, besides that which is rendered so clearly evident in the diagrams, marked [PI. C. 7] Pulp No. 6, B. ; [PI. C. 8] Pulp, Ossification, or Pevelopement of ivory. Nos. 9, 10, 16, 11, 12 ; [PL C. 9,] Pulp, Ossifica- tion or Pevelopement of Ivory, Nos. 13 and 14, and which is plainly neither more nor less than a pro- cess of ossification ;â€”a view of it totally opposed to that which has been taken by previous inquirers into the formation of ivory.*] * To enter into a full description of the details of these drawings was impossible on an occasion like the meeting at Birmingham, and I was therefore compelled to trust in some measure to the ocular demonstration they afford for conveying to the audience an impression of the nature of the interesting process by which ivory is formed. Aware of the limited extent of time which could be granted me for the exposition of this complicated and comparatively uninvestigated subject, I, as far was possible, made it speak for itself in the drawings above mentioned.

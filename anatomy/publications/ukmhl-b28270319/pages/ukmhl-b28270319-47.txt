5 tions, the results of whicli I am about to detail, will find it necessary to make use of a magnifying power of one tenth of an inch focal distance, and of the most perfect kind, with an achromatic con- denser of the light. The instrument with which I have conducted my researches, and upon the accuracy of which I place the greatest reliance, is that of Mr. Powell.* In the section of the tooth of the rhinoceros • to which I have just alluded, will be observed an appearance of cells or compartments. This I at first imagined might arise from fractures of the material, but on examining other sections of fossil teeth, examples of which are now ex- hibited, and at the same time seeking whether this cellular appearance could be observed in recent teeth, 1 was enabled to demonstrate that in every case this peculiar appearance was that of real struc- ture. The examples of this appearance in the ivory, both of fossil and recent teeth, which 1 now place * All the anatomical observations detailed in these memoirs were frequently repeated, were verified by the eyes of others, and the preparations were faithfully copied by my talented artist. It may require some practice, and a certain degree of proficiency in manipulation, to produce and examine such pre- parations of the pulp and ivory in the human subject; and some persons may perhaps be found, who, having been unsuccessful in making them, at once deny that it is possible for others to be more expert or fortunate ; but the fallacy of this will soon be evident to all persons of tact and perseverance who devote themselves to the subject.

8 contrary to the course of these fibres, as well as by the mode adopted by ivory cutters of making sections corresponding to the vertical, and not to the transverse diameter of the tooth. Many other facts might be here adduced, as well as phenomena accompanying the decay of these organs, were this necessary or relevant to the business of this section. All systems of dental structure which have hitherto been propounded have failed, I think, to explain facts of daily occurrence, but they may be accounted for, I venture to assert, by the cellular organiza- tion of the interfibrous substance which has been improperly termed structureless, and by the pecu- liar baccated arrangement of the fibres. According to the views of Retzius, Purkinje, and the recent investigators of the structure of the teeth by the aid of the rniscroscope, the enamel consists of fibres running in a direction from the centre to the circumference of the tooth. Both Retzius and Purkinje have given delineations of the course of these fibres. On making a section of the enamel, in a direction parallel to the transverse diameter of the tooth, the appearance as described by these writers is observed, and they are said to be seen to terminate in an hexagonal form beneath the investing crusta petrosa. If, however, a different section of the enamel of the human tooth be made; for instance, one near the surface, parallel to the vertical direction or long axis of the tooth, an appearance presents itself which has induced me to take a different view of the nature of the struc-

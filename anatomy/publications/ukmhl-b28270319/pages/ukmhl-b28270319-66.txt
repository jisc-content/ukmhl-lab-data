24 detached cells, with central points. Generally, these cells form a regular and complete coating, studded Mu'th points, which are placed at intervals, corresponding in extent to those between the fibres. [PI. C. 8j, Pulp, Nos. 10, 16, 12, and [PL C. 9] Nos. 13 and 14, show the appearances of these ossi- fied cells. These points are rendered visible from the greater opacity of the intermediate material, and will be seen to reflect or absorb the light, according to the difference in the focal distance. A comparison between the superincumbent perfect ivory, and the formativ^e surface of the pulp beneath, is always easy, because portions of the former, at an early stage at any rate, remain adherent to the latter, and fi-agments of the dental bone are found strewn over it, more especially in human teeth, as seen in the drawings alluded to above.* * It is almost unnecessary to state that it is impossible to obtain a clear view of tbe surface of the pulp after the process of the formation of ivory has commenced, without breaking away, or forcibly separating in some manner, tbe superin- cumbent crust of ivory from tbe pulp beneath ; and in this dis- ruption the ivory is always somewhat shattered, and the surface of the pulp is found with separate cells and cellular fragments of all shapes, and in every stage of transition, strewn over it. In the diagrams marked Pulp No. 10, Pulp No. 16, Pulp No. 11, and Pulp No. 12 and No. 13, are seen fragments of this kind, coloured yellow. In No. 14, on the other hand, which is of a very young tooth, the pulp is shown at the period of the formation of the first layers of ivory; no disruption, conse- quently, was necessary in order to exhibit it, and hence the pulp is seen with its two superior layers in successive stages of transition into ivory. The fragments above alluded to can

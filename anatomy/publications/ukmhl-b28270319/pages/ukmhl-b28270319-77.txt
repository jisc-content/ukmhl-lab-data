These are of a very pale colour, and are intimately connected with the dental substance, so that they are easily over- looked ; but when the attention is once directed to them, it is impossible not to recognize them : the spaces between them are very narrow. Against the theory that the dental substance is the ossified portion of the pulp, the facility with which the one is separated from the other has been adduced ; and I allow the force of this objection. Nevertheless .it is at any rate weakened by the circumstance that a portion of the pulp actually remains attached to the dental substance, and by the fact that in half ossified ribs, for instance, the cartilage can be easily separated from the ossified portion, and it must be remembered that in the tooth the separa- tion must be easy in proportion to the difference between the consistence of the pulp and of the dental bone.”* * I consider it a duty to acknowledge with gratitude the obligation I am under to the editor of the Literary Gazette for the extended report of my communications which he inserted in his excellent journal. When I placed in that gentleman’s hands a rough draft of my papers to assist him in draw- ing up his report of them, I did not expect that he would have given me the benefit of so extensive a report as that which made its appearance. 1 was not able, however, to see a proof of it, or I should certainly have endeavoured to explain more fully the allusions to the diagrams, and to introduce a few D 2

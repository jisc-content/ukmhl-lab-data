18 The general appearance of the fibres thus treated is exactly similar to that of the fibres of cellular tissue generally, and the diameter of each corresponds exactly to the diameter of the calibre of the tube, which, according to Retzius, is pervious, although at the same time he says that it is always more or less filled with earthy matter. In fact, the tubes have been said to be principally visible by means of their contents, the reason of which appears to me obviously to be, that these contents are the only part of them which actually exist. In order to separate the animal matter from the osseous substance of the tooth, I submitted thin slices of many different kinds of dental bone to the action of a solution of caustic potash, for a period sufficient to dissolve and remove the organic tissue; but the brittle nature of the residue, the difficulty of washing it without breaking down its structure, and the great opacity of the sections which had been thus treated, deprived this experiment of any striking results illustrative of the internal orga- nization of teeth : but the appearances presented in its progress were all such as to favour the con- clusion that the structure of the ivory is essentially cellular. but it would be still more ludicrous to maintain, that after such cells have been excreted, that is to say, after all connexion between them and the pulp has ceased, they still possess the power or means of deriving from the blood the materials requi- site for their transition into ivory, and of carrying on that process in their isolated state.

44 from the circumstance, that under certain modifi- cations it presents various vital phenomena, among which may be mentioned the ciliary motions. I now proceed to describe my researches on the structure and developement of that portion of the epithelium which lines the cavity of the mouth. In the foetal subject, previous to the extrusion of the teeth, it forms on the alveolar arch a dense, projecting layer, distinguishable from the sur- rounding membrane by its whiteness, and by the existence on its surface of ridges and sulci, having a waving course and a variable direction. The alveolar epithelium is thicker in proportion to the youth of the subject examined. It is most promi- nent where it corresponds with the molar teeth : its internal surface is concave, receiving the pro- jecting mucous membrane. This portion presents various objects for investigation. Firstly, as regards its composition :—It is made up of a mass of scales, lying one on the surface of the other. This disposition shows that the terms “ dental cartilage,'’ or the “ cartilage of the gum,” which have hitherto been applied to this structure, give an erroneous idea of its true nature, for car- tilage always presents the corpuscle discovered and described by Purkinje. As in other portions of the epithelium, the external scales here are the larger, and this holds good generally, until we come to the surface of the vascular mucous mem- brane, which presents simple cells with their cor- puscles.

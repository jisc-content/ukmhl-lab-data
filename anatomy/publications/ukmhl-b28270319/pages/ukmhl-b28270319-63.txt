21 Much diversity of opinion has always' existed respecting the connexion of the pulp with the ivory of the tooth; and as to whether the ivory be simply a product of the pulp, or a transformation of its substance. Although this is by far the most interesting point in dental physiology, and involves the grand question of the manner in which tlie tooth is formed, as well as that of its arrangement and conformation, it is notwithstanding less under- stood, has been less studied, and is consequently more obscure, than any other part of the subject. The vague style in which authors discuss, or rather dismiss this topic, shows how little has been really done to elucidate it. I must confess that I devoted myself to its examination for a long time before I was fortunate enough to obtain any light where- with to guide my steps to the discovery of its true bearings, nor am I yet certain to what extent this . knowledge of the structure of the transition surface of the pulp will be found to facilitate our compre- hension of the whole complicated process by which the ivory is developed.* * Although, from an examination of the diagrams, Pulp No. 6 A. and No. 6 B., PI. C. 7, of all the diagrams in PI. C. 8, and of the first three in PI. C. 9, it is distinctly demonstrated that the interfibrous substance of the ivory is formed by the depo- sition of osseous matter in the cells of the reticular surface of the pulp, I cannot boast of being able fully to unveil that inter- esting process. The cells for the reception of the earthy matter are displayed, butâ€”how is this matter arranged in those cells ? How is it, in the first place, derived from the blood and ntroduced into them ? What are the causes of the character- istic varieties of the interfibrous cellular substance in different

32 regard the latter as cellular. Still 1 do not con- ceive that I have in any way exhausted the subject; far from it; I am quite alive to the imperfect nature of my researches, and am prepared for cor- rection on many points, when more extended and varied investigations shall have been under- taken. I find that Schwann, in a recent work, teaches that all the primary tissues of the animal frame are cellular, and has given to the world some remark- ably interesting details on this subject. He says that he has remarked the characteristic “ cellular nuclei,” or elementary cells, on the enamel-mem- brane, that they are continued in minute fibres, and that these are similar to the epithelium cylin- ders in mucous membranes. He notices what he calls cylindrical cells on the surface of the pulp, and he supposes that these cylindrical cells of the pulp are the fibres of the tooth in their first stage, which does not at all coincide with my observa- tions. He regards the dental substance simply as the ossified pulp, whilst my observations lead me to conclude that the cells of the ivory are alto- ther a distinct formation.* He acknowledges, * To show the unwarrantable means which have been had recourse to in order to misrepresent my views of the formation of ivory, I beg to quote from an article in the Medical Gazette the following passage, exposing the manner in which the above statement has been tampered with and misrepresented : “ At p. 507, of the last week’s number of this journal, he (Mr. Owen) manufactures what he is pleased to call Mr. Nasmyth’s

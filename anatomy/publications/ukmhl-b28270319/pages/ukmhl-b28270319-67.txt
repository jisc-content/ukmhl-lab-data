25 The cellular conformation of these fragments is always evident, and in size and appearance they never be too minute for the purposes of study. Indeed, there is no more satisfactory and interesting method of examining all hard organized bodies, than by pounding them in a mortar: fragments thus produced present themselves under an infinite variety of aspects, and display, in the most various and com- plete manner, the structure of these tissues. Such particles will never be too small for observation in the focus of the instruments of the present day. With respect to the pre- paration of anatomical specimens like the above-mentioned, where the formative surface of the pulp is shown by the re- moval of the ivory, I may observe that considerable patience and perseverance, and an abundant supply of subjects of in- vestigation, are indispensable before they can be properly made; and that even great proficiency and experience will not always insure success, which necessarily depends, to a certain extent, on fortuitous circumstances, such as the nature and state of the subject, the direction and degree of the fracture, &c. It some- times happens that out of a great number of fresh-drawn teeth, not one available preparation of this kind can be made. The pulp and the ivory being in positive union, the separation at the proper point seldom occurs. When, however, the industry of the inquirer is at length rewarded by a successful preparation, he will be gratified by a view of phenomena of the highest ge- neral physiological interest, the importance and full bearings of which could only be glanced at in the present memoir. It has been asserted that no preparations can be made from mammalia showing the transition of the pulp into ivory. Such a statement can only have originated in inexperience or in ill success, arising from causes hinted at above; but the number of such preparations of the most satisfactory kind which are in my possession, and which I am always glad to exhibit to any person who may feel a wish to see them, precludes the necessity for my wasting any of my own or my readerâ€™s time, by refuting such an inconsiderate and groundless assertion.

23 these the same reticular disposition, though with characteristic variations, as seen in diagrams marked “ Capsule” and “ Enamel Investment.” [One of these is seen at PL C. 11, No. 6.] These leaves of reticulation are surrounded by a well-defined scolloped border, from which occasion- ally processes are observed to project at regular intervals, (as may be seen at [PI. C. 7] Pulp, No. 6 B.) Having thus demonstrated the cellular texture of the pulp, throughout its entire extent, I next pro- ceeded to inquire how its transition into ivory is effected. The researches which I have made on this point are as yet imperfect, and I approach the subject with diffidence, knowing the deceptive re- sults to which novel experiments are liable; and well aware of the necessity of long study and de- liberation, before judgment be positively given on a point hitherto undecided. How does the fibre of the tooth originate ? and how is the interfibrous substance, which must form the main bulk of the tooth, deposited ? I will state how far my own observations allow me to answer these difficult cpiestions. If I cannot at once satisfy the querist entirely on this subject, which has been seldom even approached, much less frankly entered upon, I may at least hope, by a few facts which I think my investigations have placed beyond doubt, to pave the way for a satisfactory explanation of the formation of dental bone. On the surface of the pulp are found innumerable

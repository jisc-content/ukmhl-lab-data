12 Thus, there is a remarkable uniformity in the structure of the formative tissues of the tooth, and of the dental substance itself; for not only is the jn- terfibrous material cellular, but the surface of the pulp, which is the organ for the production of the ivory, and the internal or productive surface of the capsule, also uniformly present a reticulated or cel- lular appearance. My researches have, I venture to hope, also established a new and beautiful instance of the har- mony of the laws of nature in demonstrating the fact of the uniformity of the products of the capsule ; for not only is the enamel uniformly provided with an external covering, but there is also a membran- ous investment of the crusta petrosa itself. I think, also, that we must be compelled to allow the uni- form presence of a fourth tooth-bone substance, the existence of which is more constant in all animals, either normally or anormally, than any of the other three hitherto recognized textures. But as all these subjects belong properly to the province of the me- dical section of the Association, I think it unneces- sary to allude to them more fully here.

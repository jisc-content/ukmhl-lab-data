2 scales, and teeth of animals being the only parts which are found in a fossil state, it is evidently of paramount importance that the general character and internal structure of these should be clearly understood. Their external forms have already been well established, and the combined labours of eminent naturalists have left little to be desired in this department of science;—but natural revolu- tions, slowly but surely taking place, during the long- march of time, whose steps the geologist is sum- moned to trace back to a period incalculably re- mote, have occasionally so mutilated these other- wise permanent remains of animals, that they retain none of the characteristic peculiarities of the species to which they belong. Here micrography comes to our aid ; and its able application to odontology by Retzius and others, so ably described to you last year by Professor Owen, has opened a new field of inquiry, which already promises the most brilliant results. Presuming that any additional researches in this direction cannot but be of interest to the members of this section of the Association, I hasten to lay before you a succinct account of my recent researches on the microscopic structure of the teeth. In endeavouring to form a classification of the animal kingdom, having for its basis the peculiar disposition and arrangement of the internal orga- nization of the teeth, I was led to the discovery of a structure, which has hitherto not been noticed. Purkinje and Frankel state that “ the proper dental substance consists of a uniform structureless sub-

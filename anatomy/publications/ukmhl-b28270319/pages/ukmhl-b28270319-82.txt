40 in immediate apposition to, the mucous membrane, are seen numerous nuclei, which more externally are surrounded by a cell; and on approaching still nearer to the surface, we find this cell, from having increased considerably in size, and become com- pressed, assuming the appearance of a scale, which retains the nucleus, and its corpuscle of primitive size. The various stages of the developement of the epithelium may be satisfactorily traced, by re- moving, after a short maceration, the layer of epi- thelium from the under surface of the tongue of a young calf, and placing it upon a piece of glass, when, if the external surface of the object be brought into focal distance, large scales only with their central nuclei are observable ; but if the ob- ject be approximated to the glass so as to bring the internal part of it into the proper focal distance, numerous small scales are brought into view; and if the object be still more approximated to the lens, so as to bring its internal surface into the proper focal distance, numerous rounded cells become ap- parent. In the foetus, the defined and well-formed scales of the epidermis are not unfrequently distinctly seen externally ; the rete Malpighii consists of newly-formed cells, and between the two may be observed other cells in a state of progressive deve- lopement. On the surface of the vascular mucous membrane minute cells are found with a nucleus in their interior, round which the cells grow; and this, in short, is the process of developement of the mi-

30 nexion with the ivory, and the spiral fibres are seen as they are evolved on the surface of the former. It appears to me, on microscopic examination, that this convoluted fibre is made up of single successive granules, which are developed one after the other from the body of the pulp, until the fibre is com- plete. I have, moreover, already shown that the fibre of decomposed teeth is resolved into separate granules or compartments, as is seen in the dia- grams marked “ Ivory deprived of Earth,” [PI. C. 6], Nos. 1 to 4. The manner in which the osseous matter is de- posited in the cells of the interfibrous substance, I have not been able to discover. It would appear, however, that these cells are subdivided into minute cellules, for they present the appearance of being filled with granules in certain progressive stages of developement, as is shown in diagrams [at PL C. 8], Pulp Nos. 9, 10, 11, 12, [and C. 9], No. 13. In whatever aspect we view the formative organs of the tooth, and the dental tissues themselves, and whether we examine the latter during the process of their developement, or after their formation has been completed, we are everywhere met by appearances which denote a cellular or reticular arrangement. I must allow that these views of the formation and structure of the teeth are both bold and novel, but I do not claim for them infallibility; I simply submit them to the Association as the results of actual observation. I fully recognize and respect the authorities ranged in support of very different

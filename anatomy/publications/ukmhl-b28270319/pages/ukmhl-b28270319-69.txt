27 together with the former, laid on a glass, compressed a little, and then examined with the high powers of the microscope. The different layers of cells will be seen, and the transition into ivory may be observed, (as shown in [PL C. 9] Pulp No. 14, where the different gradations of ossification are marked by the shade of colour.) [The diagram marked Pulp, No. 6 A. [at plate C. 7] represents the general arrangement of the reticular leaflets of the surface of the pulp. In No. 6 B. is seen a beautifully-organized single leaflet of this reticular surface, in the pre-existing cells of which the earthy matter is in course of depo- sition, and the process of ossification is seen to be gradually extending from its centre towards its cir- cumference. No. 8 [plate C. 8] shows the blood-ves- sels coursing beneath the reticular formative sur- face. This dravv'ing is an exact copy of the pre- paration, in which, as is seen, the blood-vessels have been ruptured in two places, in separating the ivory from the pulp, owing to the close con- nexion between the reticular surface and the ivory already formed. Pulp No. 9, with the title, Ossi- fication, or Developement of Ivory, and the following drawings, [see Plates C. 8 and 9,] are a selection from the interesting preparations which I have made for the purpose of elucidating the process of the formation of ivory. They display under vari- ous aspects the different appearances, some con- stant, the others incidental, which present them- selves on the removal of the superincumbent ivory

46 fringes are found to be composed of elongated scales connected together, forming masses which divide and subdivide until they attain such an ex- treme tenuity that the most minute terminations consist but of two scales in marginal apposition. If the epithelium be carefully separated from the surface of the mucous membrane corresponding to the unextruded molar teeth, and placed in water or in diluted spirit of wine for some little time, its internal or attached surface presents these fringes much enlarged and forming a mass more considerable in size than the dense epithelium itself. The epithelium covering the mucous membrane of the palate presents transverse rugae, correspond- ing to those of the mucous membrane. If these palatal rugae of the epithelium of the calf be care- fully examined from the internal surface with a magnifying power of one inch focal distance, each will be found to consist, or to be composed of, numerous depressions or cul de sacs which receive prolongations or pointed processes of the subjacent mucous membrane. They are of extreme tenuity, and, when viewed by the aid of high magnifying powers, are observed to consist of distinct scales. . A question of much interest, and one to which I have paid considerable attention, is whether recent investigators are warranted in considering mucus and epithelium as identical; I am disposed to think that they are formations quite inde-

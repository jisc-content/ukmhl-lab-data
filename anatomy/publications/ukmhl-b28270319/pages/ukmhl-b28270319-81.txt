r 39 membrane (for instance, the conjunctiva or the buccal) of a living animal be slightly rubbed, it will be found, on microscopic examination, that numerous small particles have been detached from it. At the first glance they present precisely the ap- pearance of scales, for they are flat bodies with a thick portion or nucleus in their centre, and with very thin and transparent margins. It was Leeu- wenhoek who first gave to these bodies the name of scales. They are found not unfrequently with a curved margin and without a central spot or nucleus, and their surface often presents numer- ous transparent points, with very fine lines. The nucleus of the scale generally contains a small body whicli has been termed the nucleus-corpus- cle. But by this simple method of observa- tion we do not obtain an insight into their true structure. If we remove the secretion from the surface of an irritated mucous membrane, we shall find another class of bodies which differ from these first mentioned, in being smaller and more globular. They have a nucleus of the same size as those of the so-called scales, and also a nucleus-corpuscle, but the surrounding structure is in the form of a cell, and is much smaller. Here and there may also be observed a nucleus with its accompanying cor- puscle, lying in substance which presents no ap- pearance of a cell. The structures here described may also be seen on a careful examination of a section of the epithelium and mucous mem- brane of a young subject. On the surface of, and

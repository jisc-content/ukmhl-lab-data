15 mical description may be found, by those who feel anxious to inquire further into the subject, in a paper of mine in the forthcoming volume of the Transactions of the Med, and Chir. Society, accom- panied by drawings. * At present, in order not to make inordinate demands on your limited time, I hasten to the next branch of my subject. In a paper which I have had the honour of submitting to the notice of the geological section of the Association, I have treated of the structure of the substance which in the dental ivory occupies the space between the fibres. I have proved, by a careful examination both of fossil and recent teeth, that the interfibrous sub- stance is not structureless, but that it presents a character so remarkably well defined as to furnish a most important and interesting accession to the odontographic basis for a classification of the ani- mal kingdom. I have selected specimens of these appearances, (seen in the diagrams, marked Recent and Fossil Ivory, two of which I have given at [PI. C. 5,] Nos. 8 and 10,) not with any reference to the individual peculiarity of their arrangement, but merely be- cause the drawings of them are in a more con- venient and advanced state. I have also made researches into the structure and composition of the fibres of different teeth, I have generally found that these present an in- * Here were exhibited and described the drawings contained in PI. C. 11 and 12 of the appended series.

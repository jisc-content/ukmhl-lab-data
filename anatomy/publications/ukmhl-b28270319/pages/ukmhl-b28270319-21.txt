F.G.S. “ During the author’s microscopic researches in the “ structure of the teeth, he was led to the discovery of the “ organized nature of the interjibrous substance of the “ proper dental substance, which Purkinje, Frdnkel, “ Retzms, Muller, and others, have regarded as structure- “ less, and which he is disposed to believe is so cha- “ racteristic in different animals as to be capable of “ affording valuable aid in the classification of the animal “ kingdom. This structure he first observed in a section ‘‘ of a fossil tooth of a rhinoceros, by the aid of a mag- “ nifying power of one-tenth of an inch focal distance, “ with an acromatic condenser of the light. The section “ presented the appearance of cells or compartments, their form varying in different animals. The structure also “ of the fibres presented an interrupted or baccated ap- “ pearance, the divisions differing in size and relative “ position in various series of animals. The laminated “ concentric structure of the tusk of the mammoth, the strength of ivory, when cut parallel to the axis of the “ tusk, and its weakness if cut at right angles, are urged “ in corroboration of this peculiar structure. The struc- “ ture of the enamel, as seen in a section parallel to the “ axis of a tooth, exhibits compartments of a semicircular “ fonn, the convexity of the semicircle directed upwards “ towards the free external part of the tooth. From recent “ analysis by Dr. Thomson, the proportion of animal

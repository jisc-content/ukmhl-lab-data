9 ture of the enamel. The appearance to which I now allude is represented at [Plate C. 9,] figure marked Structure of the enamel, No. 1. It will there be found that the section of the enamel pre- sents compartments or divisions, but of a different character from those I have already spoken of as existing in the interfibrous substance of the ivory. Each compartment of the enamel is of a semicircu- lar form, and the convexity of the semicircle or arch looks upwards towards the free external por- tion of the tooth. The vertical section, [Plate C. 9,] enamel No. 2, gives the appearance of these cells as seen in that direction. In the sections both of enamel and ivory,,there will be always observed near the margins isolated cells, which admit of their form and appearance being carefully studied. All the analyses hitherto made of the chemical composition of the enamel lead to the conclusion that the structure contains only a very small por- tion of animal matter. But when I detected the cells or compartments just mentioned, I could not but infer that each of these had for its basis and support a frame-work of animal tissue ; and I im- mediately requested my friend Dr. Thomson of Glasgow to favour me with a complete analysis of the teeth, and their different component structures, in their various states of health and disease. The results of this analysis, so far as it has been pro- ceeded with, are highly interesting; I present them to you in a tabidar form, and you will observe how

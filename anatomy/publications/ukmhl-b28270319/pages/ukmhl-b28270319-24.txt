*** The subjoined extracts from the correspondence of Pro- fessor Phillips, the Editorial Secretary of the British Association for the Encouragement of Science, contain the instructions in strict conformity with which I drew up a report of the following commu- nications for insertion in the Transactions of the Association. The passages to which I wish more particularly to call attention, I have placed in Italics. On the 10th of Febuary, 1840, I received from the Editorial Secretary the following note • “ Professor Phillips begs to inform Mr. Nasmyth, that the ar- rangements for printing the volume of the British Association re- quire the very earliest possible transmission of abstracts of Memoirs read, to Professor Phillips. There can only be an abstract of Mr. Nasmyth’s paper, not requiring plates, but Mr. N. is at full liberty to publish elsewhere, and at any time, the whole paper illustrated as he pleases. Professor Phillips encloses the MS. as read in the Geo- logical Section, for Mr. Nasmyth’s guidance in making his abstract. “ There will be, of course, only one abstract, though the subject of the paper was treated in two sections.” In a subsequent letter, dated Launceston, Cornwall, April 4, 1840, written after I had transmitted to him my own report, he in- formed me, that this report “ is to appear in the Proceedings of the Medical Section. On looking carefully over it,” he continues, “ there seem to be a few parts capable of abbreviation ; and as our rule of publication requires very close condensation of the communications to the sections, I return you the MS. with pencil-marks, proposing to you the omission of these few passages, to save space. They do not affect the substance of the Memoir.

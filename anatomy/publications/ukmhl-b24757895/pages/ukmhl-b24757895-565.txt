It then crosses the tendo-Achillis to the middle of the posterior aspect of the leg, where it has already been seen. TheVmoiiS Arch on the dorsum of the foot receives digital branches from the toes, gives origin to the two saphenous veins, and at its concavity which is towards the ankle is joined by several small veins ovel- the in- step Fis. 408.—Veins on dousum of bight foot. Cutaneous Nerves.—These come mainly from the internal and external popliteal nerves. Some branches from the internal saphenous ramify on the sides of the leg. The internal saphenous may be traced along the inner side of the leg as far as the phalangeal joint, giving twigs backwards and forwards. On the outer side of the leg in its upper half are cutaneous branches of the external popliteal which pierce the deep fascia on the front of the leg.

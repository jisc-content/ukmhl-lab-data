350 HUMAN MORFHOLOGY. Ilio-pubic Band or Ligament, is the strong lower border of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of the abdominal wall, and extends from the anterior superior iliac spine to the spine and crest of pubes and ilio- pectineal line. When the fascia lata is uncut, it is arched downwards. Its outer half is oblique, and the inner half is horizontal and widens at the pubes. The structm-es passing from the pelvis into the thigh nearly fill the space between this ligament and the innominata bone. The outer half is occupied by the external cutaneous nerve, the iliacus, the anterior crural, and the psoas ; the inner half by the femoral vessels in their sheath, and by a small triangular space inside the sheath on the inner side of the femoral vein. This space contains some fatty cellular tissue and some- times a small lymphatic gland, and is the femoral canal along which a Fig. 247.—Deeper dissection of the right inguino-femoral region.

The student will note that the aponem'osis of the external oblique at its lower part forms Poupart's ligament and the ligament of Colles which is continuous with Cooper's ligament, also Grimbernat's ligament, which will now be described. Dissection.—To study the femoral sheath and canal, and Grimbernat's ligament, the student must arrange with the dissector of the abdomen, who by this time will have got out inguinal hernia, &c. The peritoneum must be pushed away, after dividing tlie cord or round ligament, from the external iliac vessels to observe the septum femorale and the relations of the vessels, to the internal ring. Poupart's ligament should then be di- vided carefully an inch outside the sheath, and on reflecting it, the femoral

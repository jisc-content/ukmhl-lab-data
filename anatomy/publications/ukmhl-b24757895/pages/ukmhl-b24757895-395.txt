359 DISSECTIOX OF THE LOWER LIMB. freely cut. There was a good one-eighth of an inch between the vessel and the free edge of Gimbernat's ligament. In two cases I have seen the vessel obliquely cross the ring, from without downwards and inwards, but there was space enough above it to divide Grimbernat's ligament without risk to the vessel. The Septum Femorale, or Crurale, is that portion of the sub-peritoneal cellulo-fatty tissue which is thickest and most fibrous at the lower part of the abdomen, and passes over the upper opening of the femoral sheath; internal to the vein it covers over the internal abdominal ring, and may have a lymphatic gland either on its abdominal or femoral sur- face. Clocquet named the part of it which covers the internal ring the Tuber Isohii Fig, 260.—Int. abdominal and pemobal apeetukes seen fuom within. Tlie Uio-psoas, obturator intemus, and levator aiii cut.

Its upper surface is slightly concave, and its lower or femoral surface is convex. It is perforated by several lymphatic vessels which connect the deep in- guinal glands with those around the external iliac artery. The septum femorale is separated by some loose areolar tissue from the peritoneum, and in some cases it contains much fat which, if protruded in front of the sac of a femoral hernia, may by an inexperienced operator be mistaken for omentum. I have seen this layer much thickened, condensed, and hardened from the pressure of a truss.

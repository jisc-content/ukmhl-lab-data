DISSECTION OF THE UrPER LIMB. 120 .shoulder. Its loxver border is contiguous with the teres miijor, long heiid of triceps, and latissimus dorsi, a biu'sa sometimes intervening; also with the subscapular artery and its dorsal branch, and near its upper border are the supra-scapular vessels and nerve. xictions.—It is an internal rotator of the humerus, and will draw the bone down if the arm has been raised. If the humerus be fixed, it can draw the scapula towards it, and with the other scapular muscles will support the joint. It tends to prevent laxation of the humeral head forwards. Nerves.—The upper and middle subscapular. Varieties.—A small extra muscle sometimes passes from the sm-face Fig. 59.—Showing thk attachments of the scapulo-humehal muscles, of the subscapularis into or near the inner bicipital ridge. Gruber has named this the Subscapulo-capsularis. Other fasciculi have been observed passing either from the inferior part of the external border of the scapula to the lesser tuberosity, or from its tendon to the skin covering the axilla. An accessory subscaptdar muscle is sometimes found passing from the upper part of the axillary border in front of the long head of the triceps and of the capsule to be inserted into the humerus between the subscapularis and teres major. Dissection.—Separate the subscapuliiris from the bone and note its tendinous se[)ta, three or four of Avhich ivre attiiched to the scapular ridges, and others pass inwards fi-oin its tendon. Observe the bursa near the coracoid process, and sometimes a second between it and the latissimus K

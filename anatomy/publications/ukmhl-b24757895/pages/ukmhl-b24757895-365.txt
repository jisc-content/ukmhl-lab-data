329 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. The internal saphena vein is beneath it, and its under surface has a mem- branous aspect. In the middle of the sj)ace the two layers are easily- separated, because of the vessels and glands, but at the inner and outer borders the dissection is not so readily made. Neai- Poupart's ligament this layer, with the contained fat, becomes thinner and more fibrous. From the under sm-face of the skin, fibrous filaments pass to Poupart's ligament, and cause the crease of the groin. Now clear away the fatty tissue from the superficial vessels and nerves, and lymphatic glands, with- out destroying the deep layer of the superficial fascia beneath them. This latter is most marked on the inner side of the mid-vertical line of the thigh. The large vein called the internal sa'phena is near the middle of Fig. 229.—Diagram op incisions for dissecting the front op the lower limb. the space, and of the superficial branches of the femoral artery, two run inwards, and two out, accompanied by their veins. On the inside of the saphena vein, near the pubes, is the ilio-inguinal nerve, and the cmral branch of the genito-crural is on its outer side, and the external cutaneous nerve perforates the deep fascia near the anterior iliac spine. Some lymphatic vessels may be seen passing between the inguinal and femoral glands. Superficial Vessels.—These are branches of the common femoral artery. The two running inwards are the superior and inferior pudic, and those running outwards are the superficial circumflex, and the superficial

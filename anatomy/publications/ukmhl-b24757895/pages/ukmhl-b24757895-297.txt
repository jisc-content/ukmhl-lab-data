DISSECTION OF THE UTTER LIMB. 261 metacarpal bone of the middle finger, :ind the fibres pass ouf and converge to be inserted with the inner tendon of the flexor brevis jjollicis into the ulnar side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, and into the inner sesamoid bone. Relations.—Sujperjicially, with the flexor brevis pollicis, and the tendons of the flexor profundus, and lumbricales; deeply, with the first dorsal interosseous and the second and third metacarpal bones, and corre- sponding palmar interosseous muscles, from which it is separated by a strong aponeurosis. Its ttpper border is in relation with the deep head of the flexor brevis. Action.—It approximates the thumb to the fingers, and applies it to the radial border of the hand. Tendonsl M.'flexop Fig. 177.—Deep muscles and tendons op right hand. The tendons of the flexor sublimis and flex. long. poll, are cut. Nerve.—The ulnar. Varieties.—It may vary in its extent of origin in inverse proportion to that of the flexor brevis ])ollicis. Muscles of the Little Finger.—The palmaris brevis having already been removed, the three short muscles of this region will now have to be cleaned and defined. The Abductor Minimi Digiti is the most internal, and arises by tfndinous fibres from the i)i!siform bone and from an expansion of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and is inserted by a flat tendon into the ulnar side of the base of the first ])halanx of the little finger, sending an offset to the extensor tendon on the back of the phalanx.

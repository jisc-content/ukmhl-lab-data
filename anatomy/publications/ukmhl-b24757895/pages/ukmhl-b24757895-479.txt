DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 413 THE BACK OF THE THIGH. Dissection.—Make an incision down the middle of the back of the thigh from the gluteal region to the popliteal space, and reflect the skin to the sides. Some cutaneous vessels and nerves from the small sciatic in the middle line, and posterior branches from the external and internal cuta-. neous, on the outer and inner sides, must be sought in the fat between the layers of the superficial fascia. Trace these back to where they pierce the deep fascia, which should be carefully removed so as to avoid injury to the Fig. 325.—Diagram of ikcisions. The numbers show the direction oE the incisions. small sciatic nerve and artery; clean the hamstring muscles and the perforating branches of the profunda, also the branches of the great sciatic nerve to these muscles. The Small Sciatic Nerve,—Between the gluteus maximus and the popliteal space, this nerve lies close beneath the deep fascia, and at the lower part of the ham becomes cutaneous, and for a short distance accom- panies the external saphenous vein. It gives off some cutaneous iilaments which pierce the fascia of the back of the thigh, and a larger branch is given off near the })opliteal space. Muscles,—There are three muscles at the back of the thigh which pass

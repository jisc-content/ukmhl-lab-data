328 HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. outer and inner portions of the lower third of the thigh, corresponding to the external and internal intermuscular septa, which separate the muscles on the front from those on the back of the thigh. Dissection.—Make an incision about four inches long, and only through the skin, from the pubes along the inner side of the thigh ; from the upper end of this make one along Poupart's ligament, and from its lower end add another transversely outwards over the thigh. This piece of skin is to be reflected outwards, and then the student may commence the study of- the following parts which are comprised in this dissection; viz. the skin, super- ficial fascia, deep fascia or fascia lata, superficial and deep vessels, muscles and nerves, lymphatic vessels and glands, and the hip-joint. The skin is fine and smooth on the inner side, and covered with hairs. On the outer side it is coarser. It is very adherent at Poupart's ligament.

The Superficial Fascia is a part of the general covei'ing of the body, and is continuous with that of the abdomen above, and scrotum or labium and perineum, and with that on the spermatic cord and round ligament. It varies, with regard to the amount of fat deposited in it, in different subjects, and at the groin is divisible into two layers, a superficial and deep, between which are some cutaneous vessels and lymphatic glands. Dissection.—'Reject the superficial layer by similar incisions to those on the skin, with the exception of the lower incision, which must be two inches higher up. Then commence dissecting it from below upwards.

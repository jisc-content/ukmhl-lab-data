DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 485 iri of a dense pearly white colour. Its fibres run for the most part longi- tudinally, and its thickness varies in ditt'erent parts of the foot. There are two main intermusculai- septa which divide it into a central and two lateral parts. The Geatral Portion is much the thickest, being narrow behind where it is attached to the inner tubercle of the os calcis, behind the origin of the flexor brevis digitorum. It becomes thinner and wider in front, and ojjposite the heads of the metatarsal bones it divides into five processes for each of the toes, after having given off bands to the interdigital webs. C)pposite the metatarso-phalangcal articulation each of these processes divides into two slips which cover the joints of the flexor tendons of the toes and are attached to the sides of the metatarsal bones, and into the transverse metatarsal ligament. A series of ai'ches is thus formed Fig. 361.â€”Diagram of synovial bheaths of right sole through which the short and long flexor tendons pass to the toes. In the spaces between the five processes, the digital vessels and nerves and the tendons of the lumbricales become superficial. At the spot where the processes and slips are given off, will be found numerous transverse fibres binding them together, increasing their strength and connecting them with the skin. The central portion of the fascia is continuous with the lateral pieces, and at their point of junction sends upwards two vertical strong intermuscular septa which are broader in front, and which se^jarate the middle plantar muscles from the external and internal groups. These vertical septa give off thin transverse intermuscular septa which separate the various layers of plantar muscles. The lateral jnecea of the plantar fascia cover the sides of the foot, and

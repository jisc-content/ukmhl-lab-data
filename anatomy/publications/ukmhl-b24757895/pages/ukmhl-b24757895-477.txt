The Popliteal Vein is formed by the union of the anterior and posterior tibial veins, and has much the same course and relations as the artery and internal popliteal nerve. It receives branches corresponding to those of the artery. It is superficial to the artery between the heads of the gastroc- nemius, and at the lower border of the popliteus muscle is internal to the vessel, but gradually passes to the outer side where it becomes the femoral T'l'mur Gastroc. ext. head^ Flantaris.

The short saphenous empties itself into it about the middle of the space after perforating the deep fascia. Varieties.—This vein is often double along the lower part of the artery, but less frequently so at its upper portion. Directions.—The dissector should now examine the origin and inser- tion of muscles and tendons and the various bursse in this region, and observe if they communicate with the knee joint.

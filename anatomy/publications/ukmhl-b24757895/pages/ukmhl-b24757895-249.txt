niSSJECTION OF THE UPPUlt LIMB. 213 interosseous nerve may be more fully traced. I'he dorsal interossei muscles should then be cleaned and studied, and the posterior perforating arteries dissected out between their heads of origin, and the anterior perforating defined near tlieir insertions. There cU-e six separate'partitions between the posterior annular ligament and the posterior aspect of the lower ends of the radius and ulna. They are from within outwards. 1. A groove for the tendons of the extensor ossis and primi internodii, on the outer side of the styloid process of the radius. 2. Another for the tendons of the extensors carpi radialis longior and brevior, behind the styloid process. 3. A deeper, narrower, oblique groove for the extensor secundi. 4. A groove for the extensors communis and indicis. 5. One for the extensor minimi digiti, which is between the I?nrl. art. Fig. 132,â€”Eight dorsal interossei and radial artery. The metacarpal artery represents the posterior or dorsal arterial arch. radius and ulna. 6. For the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris on the back of the ulna. The Dorsal Interossei muscles are four and are larger than the palmar. They are ptinniform muscles and arise by two heads from the adjacent sides of the fifth metacarpal bones, but more extensively from that side of the metacarpal bone which corresponds to the side of their insertion, which is into the bases of the fir.st phalanges, and into the expansion of t,he common extensor tendon. Between the heads of origin of each muscle is a small triangular interval, through which a posterior perforating branch from the deep palmar arch passes to anastomose with the dorsal interossei arteries. The First Dorsal Interosseous or Abductor Indicis is larger than the rest. It is flat and triangular, and arises by two heads, separated by a

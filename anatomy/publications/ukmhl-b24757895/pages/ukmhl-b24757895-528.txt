HUMAN MOlirilOLOGY. 492 tubercle of the os calcis and be inserted into the process of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone beneath the outer margin of the plantar fascia. Dissection.—The second layer of muscles and plantar vessels and nerves may be exposed by two methods, viz. either by dividing the super- ficial muscles close to their origins and reflecting them, noticing a branch, of nerve and artery to them; or by passing a small thin saw carefully imderneath their origins, and sawing off a thin piece of the os calcis. This second method has tlie advantage of preserving the attachment of the superficial muscles which can be replaced afterwards if necessary. The internal plantar'vessels and nerve must be cleaned from their origin to their termination, and the external plantar vessels and nerve, the ten- dons of the flexor longus digitorum with the flexor accessorius on its outer side, the lumbricales between its tendons, and the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis on its inner side and beneath it (in this position), must be cleaned. The Plantar Vessels are the teiminal branches of the posterior tibial artery, and in this part of the dissection will be found superficial to the tendons lying between the first and second muscular layers.

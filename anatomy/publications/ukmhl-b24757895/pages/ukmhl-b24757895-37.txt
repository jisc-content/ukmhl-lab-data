Some knowledge of the antecedents of the science one is about to study is of advantage to the student, and the following brief account is introduced as likely to prove useful and interesting.^ A vast deal of research has been employed in tracing the origin of anatomy to India and Egypt, chiefly because these countries were the cradles of civilisation. But in India the doctrine of metempsychosis pre- cluded the dissection of animals. The process of embalming of bodies among the Egyptians chiefly consisted in the removal of the viscera and the introduction of resinous substances. The embalmers, moreover, were ignorant men of the lowest clasSj and so execrated by the people that Diodorus Siculus says, ' they had frequently to perform their function to the danger of their life.' The fragmentary knowledge thus obtained can- not be dignified by the name of Science. The Greeks had similar prejudices as regards the dead, so that their physicians and philosophers were chiefly confined to the study of the bodies of the lower animals, in order to obtain an approximate knowledge of the structure of the human body. And thiis from its very beginning was the progress of anatomy obstructed and interrupted, nor is anatomy even now completely emancipated. The history of anatomy, excluding what may be called its mythological epoch, is generally divided into three periods: from Hippocrates to Galen; from Gfilen to Vesalius ; from Vesalius to the present time. FIRST PERIOD. HirPOCRATES, 4GG B.C., TO GALEN, 130 A.D. There can be no doulit that Hippocrates possessed good general notions of the skeleton and of the general structure! of the huiiiivn body, but the profovmd knowledge of anatomy, strictly so called, attributed to ' the ' Only tho moat important epochs anrl namos have been given, as space will not admit of a fullor account, vvhicli, nioicovcr, is not actually necessary to the stuilent.

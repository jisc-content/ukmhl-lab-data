141 DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. by (he teres minor, hdow by the teres major, and outside by the long head of the triceps, the dorstdis scaprd;e artery 2:)asses. Action.—The limb being pendent it acts as an internal rotator, and draws the arm backwards. The arm being raised the muscle adducts and depresses it. This and the two preceding muscles will, if the humerus be tixed, draw the scapula towards it, the teres major causing the lower angle of the scapula to move forwards, rotating the scapula on the rib on an antero-posterior axis. Nerve.—It is supplied by the middle and long subscapular nerves. Varieties.—This muscle sometimes has fasciculi of connection with the latissimus dorsi, coming from some part of the scajDula, and occasion- ally a slip from it has been seen descending on the deep fascia of the upper arm externally. For postr. cirf.v. A and cirfx. and N to teres niin. Fig. 70.—Scapulo-humeual muscujs. Posteeiob view. Dissection.—ligaments connecting the clavicle and scapula must be examined before proceeding to the examination of the supra-spinatus muscle, and to expose them the remaining fibres of the trapezius and deltoid muscles and the areolar tissue must be removed. ScapuLo-Clavicular Ligament and Articulation.—This joint is formed by the outer end of the clavicle and the upper edge of the acromion pro- cess of the scapula. The clavicle is joined to the scapula by tliis articula- tion, and by the strong coraco-clavicular ligament. The scapulo-acromial Jnuit possesses a superior and inferior acromio-clavicular ligament and an inter-a,rticula,r fihro-cartilage. The Superior Acvomio-Ukivicular Ligament is a square broad band covering the upper pcirt of the joint, being attached to the clavicle at the iipixn- p:irt of its outer end, and to the upper part of the acromion. Its Wnes arc parallel and interlaced with the aponeurosis of the deltoid and

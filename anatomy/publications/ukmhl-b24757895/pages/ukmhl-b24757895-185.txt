J 49 ascends on the outer side of the biceps, and at the upper third of the arm is between the pectoralis major and the deltoid, accompanied by the descending branch of the acromial thoracic aitery and the upper external cutiuieous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve, and ends just below the clavicle, between it and the coracoid process, in the axillary vein after piercing the costo-eoracoid membrane.

There is usually a venide uniting this vein with the basilic or with the vein which joins the basilic just below the middle of the arm. Varieties.—This vein often ends with the external jugular above or below the clavicle. The jugulo-cephalic is (when present) the branch of communication between this and the subclavian veins. The Veins of the Upper Arm are Superficial and Deep.—The most important of the former veins of the arm are those which have been described. Many others which are innominate will be observed by a careful dissector, and will be seen to form free anastomoses between them-

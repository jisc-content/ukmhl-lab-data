239 DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. Relations.—Superficially, with the flexor sublimis, flexor carpi radialis, supinator longus and radial vessels; deeply, with the radius, interosseous nienibrane and pronator quadratus. Its idnar border is in relation with the flexor profundus digitorum, the anterior interosseous vessels and nerve intervening. Actions.—It at first bends the distal phalanx, then the proximal, and can afterwards flex the wrist, drawing it somewhat inwards in consequence of its oblique direction.

Vdrietles.—In two-fifths of the subjects dissected by Macalister, he found a second or accessory tendon for the thumb. This may arise from the inner condyle, the coronoid process or from the flexor sublimis. The flexor longus pollicis may be connected by a slip with the sublime or deep flexor or the pronator teres. A tendon of insertion into the index finger has also been noticed. The Pronator Quadratus is a flat quadrilateral muscle, passing trans- versely across the front of the lower part of the radius and ulna. It arises from the obli([Ue line on the lower fourth of the anterior aiuface of the

DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. 205 sometimes joins the extensors on the dorsum of the little finger. This slip has been named the nlnaris guinti. The Anconeus is a small triangidar muscle behind and below the elbow joint, and seems to be a continuation of the outer portion of the triceps. It arises by a separate tendon from the back of the outer condyle of the humerus and on the ulnar side of the common extensor tendon; the fibres then diverge, the upper ones passing transversly and the lower obliquely, to he inserted into the outer side of the'olecranon and upper third of the posterior surface of the shaft to the ulna. Relations.—Superficially, is a strong fibrous expansion from the Fie. 126.—DiAOKAM OF THE SYNOVtAL SHEATHS OF THE EXTENSOR TENDONS OF THE LEFT HAND AND THE MARKINGS ON THE DOESUM OP THE FIN&EKS. triceps ; and, deeply, are the elbow joint, the orbicular ligament, the recur- rent interosseous vessels, the ulna, and a small part of the supinator brevis. Action.—Its transverse fibres assist the triceps in extending the elbow, but its oblique ones may i)ossibly help in flexing the elbow. Nerve.—Posterior interosseus. Dissection.—Divide the extensors communis, minimi digiti, and carpi nlnaris just below their origins, and reflect them, and observe the branches of the posterior interosseous artery and nerve going to these muscles.

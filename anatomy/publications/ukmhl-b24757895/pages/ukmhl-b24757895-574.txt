Nerve.-—The anterior tibial, and at its upper part by the recurrent branches of the external popliteal. The Extensor Proprius Pollicis, or Extensor Halhicis, is at its origin situated deeply between the tibialis anticus and the extensor longus digi- torum. It arises from the middle three-fifths of the anterior narrow portion of the inner surface of the fibula, internal to the origin of the Ma Fig. 41G.—Muscles of frokt of right leg and anterior tibial and dorsalis PEDIS arteries.

It also arises from the contiguous part of the interosseous ligament to a similar extent. Its fibres pass obliquely down and in to a tendon occupying the anterior and inner border of the muscle. This tendon becomes superficial at the ankle and passes through a distinct sheath in the lower part of the anpular ligament. It crosses the anterior tibial vessels near the bend of the ankle, and passing over the inner part of the tarsus is inserted into the base of the terminal phalanx of the great

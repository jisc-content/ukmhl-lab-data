HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 510 Action.—They approximate the three outer toes to the second toe. The Dorsal Interossei are four in number, and are placed between the metatarsal bones, arising by two heads in a bipenniform manner from the lateral surfaces of the metatarsal bones between which they are placed. Their tendons are, like the plantar interossei, inserted into the sides and dorsum of the first phalanges in the following way. The inner two dorsal interossei are attached to the second toe, one on each side ; the next is inserted to the outer side of the third toe; and the other to the outer side of the fourth. Relations.—The plantar muscles are crossed by the external plantar artery and nerve, and their digital branches, and lie beneath the transver- salis pedis and the metatarsal ligament. The angular interval at the, posterior extremity of the double origin of each of the dorsal interossei (except the first through which the communicating branch of the dorsalis Axis of font Fig. ;-588.—Dorsal interossei of right foot. pedis joins the external plantar) is pierced by the posterior perforating arteries from the plantar arch which join the interosseous branches of the metatarsal. Actions.—The dorsal interossei are abductors from the mid-line of the second toe. The two dorsal interossei connected with the second toe will move it to the inner or outer side of that line. Dissection.—Trace the tendon of the tibialis posticus to its insertion, and dissect out its various processes backwards to the os calcis, forwards to the middle and external cuneiform, and outwards to the cuboid and bases of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. This is the largest of these processes. Lay open the fibrous sheath of the peroneus longus, and trace it to its insertion. The student will note that tendinous bands of the tibialis posticus are connected with all the tarsal bones except the astra- galus, and with all the metatarsal bones except the first and fifth. Where

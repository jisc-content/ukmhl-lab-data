HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 526 internal popliteal. The internal saphenous not infrequently sends branches through the capsule to its synovial lining. Filaments from the branch of the vastus externus and of the external popliteal enter the joint with the superior external articular artery in front, as also do twigs from the internal saphenous. Behind, both popliteals supply the joint, and one twig accompanies the azygos articular artery. Inside, a branch from the internal popliteal accompanies the inferior internal articular, and outside a branch from the anterior tibial runs with the anterior tibial recurrent artery.

Extension by the quadriceps and tensor fasciae latse. Internal rotation by the sartorius, semitendinosus, gracilis, popliteus, and slightly by the tensor fasciae latae. External rotation by the biceps. The bursce in the neighbourhood of the joint are, in front, the pre- patellar and one superficial to, and another beneath, the ligamentum

Its base, or inferior margin, is towards the rectum, and is connected in the mid-line to the central perinseal point; while laterally it is free, and slopes obliquely towards the tubera ischii. It is continuous around the posterior border of the transversus peringei with the deep layer of the superficial fascia, and also with the thin fascia covering the levator ani.

HUMAN MORrilOLOGY. 416 be a guide to its depth. When these are reached the muscles should be thrown downwards; all vessels and nerves entering it being divided. Clean away the fat and connective tissue between the pelvis and the tro- chanter, and the latter and tuber ischii, being careful of the vessels and nerves. Seek the bursas over the great trochanter, the tuber ischii, and between the insertion of the gluteus maximus and the origin of the vastus externus, then throw towards the middle line the origin of the great gluteus and trace the sacral nerves to the surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament. On tracing these offsets to their origin they will be found to come from the loop of the outer posterior branches of the first three sacral nerves on the great sacro-sciatic ligament. The looped arrangement will be seen on removing a fibrous layer which covers them. They should be Fig. 302.—Muscles of the eight gluteal region. traced inward beneath the multifidus spinae to the posterior sacral foramina. The Gluteus Medius is situated mainly in front of the maximus; is broad, thick, and triangular, and passes from the outer surface of the ilium to the femur. Its base arises from between the crest and superior curved line of the ilium, and from the gluteal aponeurosis covering its anterior part. The fibres converge to a strong flattened tendon which forms its apex, and which is inserted into the oblique line at the outer surface of the great trochanter, extending from the tip behind to the root in front. A small bursa is found between it and the great trochanter. Relations.—Above, at its posterior third is the gluteus maximus. Be- hind are the cutaneous vessels and nerves before mentioned. The tensor fasciee femoris and deep fascia are superficial to it in front. Its anieinor

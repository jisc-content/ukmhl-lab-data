226 HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. extensor tendons. When there are vasa aberrantia from the brachial or axillaiy arteries they commonly end in the radial or one of its branches. Other peculiarities of the radial have been given in describing the anoma- lies of the axillary and brachial arteries. Peculiarities of the Branches.—The radial recurrent may be very large, or represented by several small branches. If the radial itself be given off from the brachial, its recurrent branch has been seen passing beneath the biceps tendon, and in other cases of the origin of the radial high up, the recurrent vessel comes from the brachial trunk, or from the ulna; and more rarely from the interosseous. Fiy. 1-10.—Deep muscles of fokeaem. Eight side. The Sxijperjicial Volar is often very small, and ends in the thumb muscles without joining the palmar arch or any of the digital arches. In eases where it is enlarged it gives one or two digital branches and may or may not anastomose with the superficial arch. It may arise from the radial an inch and a half higher than usual. The radial very frequently gives off a communicating branch to the superficial arch near the lower border of the abductor pollicis. The, Carpal and Interosseous or uMetacarpal branches of the radial

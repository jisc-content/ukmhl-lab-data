HUMAN MORPJIOLOar. "124 Nerves.—The intercostal nerves supply these muscles. Dissection.—Cut through and remove the cartilages of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th ribs, also the intervening structures; preserve the in- tercostal vessels and nerves; clean away some loose fatty tissue, and the outer surface of the triangularis sterni will be seen. The Triangularis Sterni is a thin stratum of muscular and tendinous fibres within the thorax posterior to the costal cartilages. It arises from the posterior surfaces of the ensiform cartilage, from the side of the lower part of the sternum, as high as the third costal cartilage, and from the car- tilages of one or two of the lower true ribs. Its fibres diverge out and up, the upper being nearly vertical, the middle oblique, and the lower hori- lil Lower border of rib with its groove for the inter- costal vessels nnd nerve below tliem Section of tlioracio parietes and ribs Section of extcrnnl iutercostals f w\ Section of internal iutercostals Fig. 56.—Vertical section through the ribs of the right side, about midway, to show the relatioits of the intercostal muscles. zontal. They are inserted by separate fleshy slips into the true ribs from the sixth to the second inclusive, on the lower border and inner surface of each, at the junction of the bone with the cartilage, and into the intercostal aponeurosis. Its lower horizontal fibres are in the same plane with the transversalis abdominis, of which this muscle is an upward continuation. Relations.—Behind with the pleura, in front it is covered by the costal cartilages, internal costal muscles, internal mammary vessels, and the ends by the intercostal vessels and nerves. Action.—It assists in depressing the anterior ends of most of the ti'ue ribs, and thus diminishes the thoracic capacity. It acts as an expiratory muscle. Nerves.—Upper intercostal nerves.

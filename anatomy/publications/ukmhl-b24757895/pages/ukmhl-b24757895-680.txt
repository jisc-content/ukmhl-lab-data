HUMAN MORFJIOLOGY. 644 Action. Its radial fibres shortening concentrically raise the skin around the anus into radiating ridges. j^erve.—The inferior hfemorrhoidal. The Sphincter Externus is placed immediately beneath the skin and corrugator, and is an orbicular muscle whose fibres are elliptically ar- ranged around the anus, and like other sphincters it consists of two planes of muscular fibres. It extends half an inch on each side of the anus, and arises by a fibrous band—the ano-coccygeal raphe—from the back of the coccyx near its tip, and by some fleshy fibres on either side from the sub- cutaneous tissue. After siurounding the anus, it passes foi-wards and blends with the superficial transverse and bulbo-cavemosus muscles, and Fig. i66.—Superficial dissection op the male peein^um. The subject being placed on its face. is inserted into the central point of the perinseum, or ano-bulbar raphe, and by fleshy slips into the superficial fascia. Its deeper fibres form a loop which pass uninterruptedly in front of the rectum. The ano-bulbar raphe is beneath the point of meeting of the super- ficial transverse muscles. Action.—It is usually in a state of involuntary contraction, but this may be voluntarily increased. It closes the anal apertm-e and puckers up the surrounding skin, and like all the perinaeal muscles is contracted dur- ing coition. Relations.—Superficial to it are the skin and corrugator, beneath it is the lower part of the levator ani, its inner border is contiguous to the internal sphincter, and its oioter extends partly over the ischio-rectal fossa.

The muscles must be carefully separated, and a slender portion of the posterior interosseous nerve, which is beneath the extensor secundi internodii, about the middle of the forearm, must not be injvu-ed. Deep Muscular Layer.—There ai-e five small muscles in this layer; three are special extensors of the thumb, and one of the forefinger, and there is one supinator of the forearm, the supinator brevis, which smrounds the upper part of the radius; and below this are the three thumb muscles in the following order from above downwai'ds: fii'st, the extensor ossis Fig. •1-27.—KiGHT foreakm muscles. Outek aspect. metacarpi pollicis; then the extensor primi internodii; and then the secundi internodii. The extensor indicis is on the back of the ulna. The Extensor Ossis Metacarpi Pollicis {Abductor Longus Pollicis) is the largest, highest, and most external of the thumb extensors. It is immediately below the supinator brevis, vnth which it is sometimes blended. It arises from an elongated depression on the radial side of the posterior surface of the shaft of the ulna, below the origin of the supinator brevis and the insertion of the anconeus, from the back of the interosseous liga-

J)IS^Â£CTIOX OF THE UPPjEli LIMB. 180 o\\ tho outer and inner sides, are two lateral depressions corresponding to the radial and ulnar arteries, the outer corresponding to the radial, the inner to the ulnar artery. The inner groove can be seen along the lower inilf of the forearm, and the outer one tends toAvards the middle of the limb near the elbow. On the back of the forearm and hand, the subcu- taneous veins are larger and more numerous than on the anterior aspect, and beneath them, under the deep fascia, are the extensor muscles and tendons, and the space between the radius and ulna can be more plainly felt on this aspect in the lower half of the forearm. On the outer side of the palm of the hand is a large projection, formed bv the muscles of the thumb, called the thenar eminence, and on the inner side is the hypo-ihenar eminence, formed by the muscles of the little finger, and between the two is a groove, narrow near the wrist, which forms the hollow of the palm, beneath which is the middle portion of the palmar fascia. Two oblique and two transverse lines are seen in the palm which are usually of the shape of the italic letter M 5 the one nearer the finger tips corresponds to the front of the metaearpo'-])halangeal artic'ida,- tion of the index and little fingers, but is about a quarter of an inch ])ostcrior to that of the two inner digits. There are also two lines on the skin on the anterior aspect of -the lower end of tlie forearm, the lower hoing just above the inner and outer muscular jirominences of the hand, and corresponds with the anterior aspect of the first row of carpal bones;

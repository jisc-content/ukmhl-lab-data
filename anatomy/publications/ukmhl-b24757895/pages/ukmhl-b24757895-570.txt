The deep fascia of the front of the leg completely covers the soft parts in this region. At its upper and fore part it is strong and thick, and is continuous with the fascia lata above, and receives expansions from the hamstring tendons. It is attached to the outer margins of the tibia and fibula blending with their periosteum, and below it is continuous with the anterior annular ligament. From its deep surface it gives origin to the muscles in front of the leg, and also furnishes intermuscular septa. On Fig. 413.—Veins and nekves op dobsum on left foot. the outer side of the leg it gives off two strong intermuscular septa which include the peronei and separate them from the muscles on the anterior and posterior tibial regions, and a broad transverse septum—the deep fascia of the front of the leg—is continuous with its intermuscular septa, and separates the superficial muscles of the posterior tibio-fibular regions from the deep. Below the end of the fibula it is continuous with and helps to form the external annular ligament, and above and below the ankle joint it is re-

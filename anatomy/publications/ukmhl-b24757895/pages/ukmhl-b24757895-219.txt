DISSHCTION OF THE UVPER LIMB. 183 part which coniiniuueates with tlie synovial process or bursa under the infra-,si)inatus, and a third, which has been before mentioned, for tlie long head of the bicejis. The Goraco-Humeral or Accesson^ Ligament of the capsule is a thick band of fibres extending obliquely over th(! upper and anterior part of the capsule. It arises from the root of the coracoid process, and passes obliquely down and out to the margins of the bicipital grooves and to the tuberosities, bh;nding with the tendon of the supra-spinatus, and partly with that of the subscapularis. A few fibres of this accessory process project into the joint, and ai-e inserted to the inner and upper part of the bicipital Fig. lOU.—Left shoulder joint. Posterior view. Scapular spine partly removed. groove. These have been called the gleno-humeral ligament, and are said to correspond with the ligamentum teres of the hip-joint. Relations.—In front and internally, is the subscapularis; behind, are the infra-spinatus and teres minor; above, the supra-spinatus; and below, the long head of the triceps. The long head of the biceps is first antero- extemal to the joint, and then within its capsule. The bony arch above is formed by the acromion and outer end of the clavicle, and the coraco- acroinial ligament is above it. The deltoid caps all these structures, being separated from them by a large multilocular bursa. Dissection.—Divide the ca))Hule near its scapular attacliiuent, being carefid to stop within a ([uarter of an inch in front and behind tlie long

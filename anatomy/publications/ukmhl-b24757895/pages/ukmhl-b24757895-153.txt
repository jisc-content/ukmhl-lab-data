117 DISSECTION OF THE JJPVER LIMB. The Internal Cord gives off the internal anterior thoracic, internal cutaneous, lesser internal cutaneous, or Wrisberg's nerve, internal root of median and ulnar. The Posterior Cord gives oS three subscapular (short, middle, and long), the circumflex and the musculo-spiral. The student will note that the branches of the external cord are all named external^ and those of the internal, with the exception of the ulnar, all bear the j^refix internal. This will assist him to remember the branches of the outer and inner cords and also of the posterior cord, which are indirectly known by not having the prefixes external or internal attached to them. FiQ. 50.—Branches op right postekior cord, outer and inner cords cut ; ALSO THE AXILLARY ARTERY AND ITS BRANCHES. This cord, after giving off the aubsonpular and clrcninflex nerves, is continued as the musculo-spinvl. The outer and inner cords are cut. Varieties,—The trunk formed by the fifth and sixth nerves often unites with the seventh at the outer border of the scalenus anticus, and thus only two instead of three trunks are found. Sometimes the branches which form the posterior cord are given off as low as the clavicle, but usually they arise at a higher level than do the two other ccrds. The fifth alone, or the sixth with it, often pierces the upper part of the anterior scalenus, and the former sometimes passes quite in front of this muscle. Directions.—Each of these nerves must be traced to its origin, but the continuations of most of them cannot now be dissected.

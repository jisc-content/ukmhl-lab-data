mSSJ^CTIOJV OF Tim lower limb. 617 its outer and back part the capsule is pierced by the tendon of the popliteiis. The Tendon of Origin of the Poxditeus Muscle may now be traced out. It will be found to arise from the anterior part of- an oblong depres- sion on the external surface of the outer condyle. It then crosses the external fibro-cartilage and the back of the superior tibio-fibular joint. If the knee joint be now bent the tendon will be seen to occupy the groove on the condyle, but if it be extended the tendon will slip out of the groove. The Tmdon of the Adductor Magnus must be traced to its insertion Supra-pat. s; Pro-] Bursa te Bursa in fr< Fig. 396.—Anteko-posteriob vbbtical section of eight knee.

Directions.—Before laying open the joint to study the synovial mem- brane and interarticular ligaments, the student should introduce the blow-pipe, and inflate the joint with air, or inject water, to see any pro- cesses of the synovial membrane which may project between the ligaments, and more especially through the posterior ligament. The pouches of the synovial membrane above and at the sides of the patella and over the back of the condyles will become distended, the ligamentum patella3 will be stretched, and the patella itself floated up. This condition of paits exists in efTusion of serum or pus into the joint in synovitis. Dissection.—Place a block in the popliteal space so as to raise and flex the knee, lay open the joint by an incision across it above the patella. This cut should extend to the back of the condyles.

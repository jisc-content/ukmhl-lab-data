633 DISSECTION OF THE PEEINiEUM. The owner of the abdomen must begin his part by dissecting this region, which is usually allotted with it. The perinseum is generally dis- sected on the first day, and begun early, so as not to interfere with the progress of the other dissectors, and also because if the parts be not examined soon they lose their distinctness. Its dissection must be com- pleted on the first day or two. Directions.—Place the body on its back, introduce a metal catheter into the bladder, and tie it in with a loop of string, which should pass from the penis to the handle of the staff or catheter. Draw the buttocks quite to the edge of the table, and if necessary, raise the pelvis by a small hollow block placed beneath the buttocks ; bend the thighs on the trunk and the legs on the thighs, and abduct the latter so as to put the perinseum on the stretch. To keep the parts in this position, put the apparatus shown in the figure between the thighs, and fasten it on. By Fig. 469.—Diagram op incisions fob dissecting the perineum. The instrument for keeping the legs npart is in position. it the knees can be approximated or separated to suit the convenience of the dissector. Should this simple, convenient, and useful apparatus not be in the dissecting room, the limbs may be seciued in the necessary position thus. After having bent the limbs as directed, pass a stout long cord twice round one knee, then under the table and around the other, and before fastening it off to the opposite knee, place a light block of wood between them. Another method of fixing the limbs in the required position is by having upright spokes fitted to the sides of the dissecting table, to or over and round which the knees are fastened by a rope. These methods are superior to that of tying the hands and feet together as is usually done— after the manner adopted before the operation of lithotomy—because they

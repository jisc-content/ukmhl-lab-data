292 HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. f ' by reciprocal reception.' It is capable of the four angular movements : flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction, also of circumduction and A opposition. ; In flexion the metacarpal bone is brought towards the palm, and in j extension movements in the opposite direction take place. Flexion is produced by the flexor brevis, abductor et opponens polUcis, and extension by the extensores primi et secundi pollicis. In abduction and adduction the metacarpal is approximated to, or removed from, the forefinger ; the former is produced by the extensor ossis metacarpi, and the latter by the adductor pollicis. In opposition the ball of the thumb is tm-ned towards the tip of each finger by motions partly circumduetory; and in holding a pen or picking Fig. 216.—Synovial cavities of the left caepus.

Circumduction is a combination of these movements, and is produced by the short and long muscles acting ujDon the metacarpal bone and phalanges of the thumb. Articulations of the Metacarpals with the Second Carpal Row.—These joints are arthrodial, and are connected mainly by two dorsal ligaments to each digit, except to the little finger; by one palmar to each, except the third metacarpal; and by interosseous ligaments. The Dorsal Ligaments are the strongest and most distinct. The

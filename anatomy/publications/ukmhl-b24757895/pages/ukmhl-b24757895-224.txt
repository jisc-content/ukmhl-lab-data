The cuneiform may be felt about an inch below the styloid process of the ulna, at the back of the wrist, and the pisiform is about the same distance below the ulnar head on the front of the inner side of the wrist. This little bone is movable, having a separate joint, with the cuneiform, and the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris is inserted into it. The bases of the metacarpal bones of the fingers can be felt on the dorsum of the hand, and the articulation between the meta^ carpal bone of the thumb and the trapezium can be made out aliout an process Fir. 110.—The relation ov the kioht akm-bones to the surface.

The unciform process of the uncifoi-m can be felt in the palm on making deep pressure about half an inch below and to the outer side of the pisiform. The heads of the meta- carpal bones can be plainly felt, and are well seen on the posterior aspect during flexion of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. They form tlie ]-»roniin- ences of the knuckles.

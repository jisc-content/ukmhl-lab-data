PREFACE. When, some years ago, I was requested to undertake a work tlie first volume of whicli is now before the profession, I acceded, in the belief that a larger practical book on anatomy, which should be copiously illustrated and which should also mclude the impor- tant subject of Anatomical Technics, would be acceptable as a handbook to the student ambitious to obtain the higher desTees, and as a work of reference to the physician, practitioner, and operating surgeon. If any apology or further reason be required for producmg another anatomical work, it must be found in the fact that there is no precisely similar work on practical anatomy in any language. Almost the whole of the work has been written for some years, but several causes have interfered with its earlier publication, the chief of which have been the necessity for repeated condensa- tion and the exigencies of private and increased hospital practice ; but, notwithstanding that I have altered the original comprehen- sive character of the work, and have excised many interestmg notes on what we at present call anomalies, and moreover (this being to me the most disagreeable part) have considerably re- duced the sections on the practical applications of my subject, yet the complete work will extend to three volumes of between six and seven hundred pages each. I have also, in order to save space, deleted most of the paragraplis on unusual or fancy dis- sections, although these are undoubtedly serviceable to the student

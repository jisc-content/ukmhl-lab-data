HUMAN MORFIIOLOGY. 106 Relations of the Second Part.—It is covered in front by the pectovalis major and minor; behind it is separated by a cellular space from the sub- scapularis and posterior nerve cord; on the inner side is the axillary vein. The brachial plexus surrounds this part of the vessel and separates it from the vein and neighbouring vessels, the outer cord being external, the inner internal, and the middle behind the vessel. Eelations of Second Paet of Axillary Artekt. Infrwit.—Skin and fascia, and pectoi-alis major and minor. Outside.—Outer cord. Behind.—Subscapularis and posterior cord of the brachial plexus, 1. AxiUaxy artery. 2. Inner cord. 3. Internal cutaneous. 4. Ulnar. 6 and 9. Outer and inner lieads of median nerve. 6. Outer cord. 7. External cutaueous. 8. The median. S Fig. 40.—Eelations op left axillary artidry to nerves (diagrammatic). Relations of the Third Part.—Beyond the pectoralis minor it is in relation in front and above with the lower part of the pectoralis major, but below this only with the skin and fascia and internal cutaneous nerve. Behind it are the lower part of the subscapularis and the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major, and the median and musculo-spiral nerves. On its outer side are the coraco-brachialis and median and musculo-spiral nerves, and at its inner side are the axillary vein, uhiai- and internal cutaneous nerves. Eelations op Third Part op Axillary Arteby, In front,—Skin and fascia and pectoralis major and internal cutaneous nerve. ■ Outside. — Ooraco-brachialia and median and musculo-spiral nerves. Behind.—Subscapularis, tendons of latissimus dorsi and teres major, musculo- spiral and circumflex nerves. Axillary Artery Inside.—Inner cord, axillary vein, internal anterior thoracic uwve. Inside.—Axillary vein, and ulnar and internal cutaneous nerves.

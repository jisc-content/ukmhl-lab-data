DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 347 "Igameiit and does not jjass into the scrotum ov labium, while complete inguinal hernia does. Much confusion is caused to the student by the indiscriminate use of the terms crural and femoral in the description of this hernia. Crural comes from cms, which signifies the leg, and is not applicable to this region, which is the femorat. We shall, therefore, only- call them the femoral canal and rings, and femoral sheath, septum, and arches. The Saphenous Opening results in consequence of the iliac portion of the fascia lata being on a plane anterior to the pubic portion. The former being attached to Poupart's ligament is in front of the femoral vessels and Sup. fmcia Sap. epig. a, mill lyinpb, Sup. cirf.— Int. pillar of ring^ Sup. lymph. Sup. fascia Ext. obliq.

The ilio-inguinal and hypogastric nerves are shown ; also the internal outaneons of thigh. their containing sheath, and the latter behind, being attached to the ilio- pectineal line and continuous with the pelvic fascia, so that that part of the deep layer of the superficial fascia which covers the opening and is called the cribriform fascia, slants from without inwards in consequence of the outer margin of the opening being on a higher level than the inner. The Saphenous Opening, or Superficial or External Femoral Ring or aper- ture, is the lower and larger aperture of the femoral canal, and is an oval aper- f ure at the upper and inner part of the thigh, and is directed obliquely down and outwards. It is about an inch and a half long and about half an inch wide. Its outer margin or edge is sickle-shaped, and therefore called the falciform process of the opening, or superior c.ornu, and extends from

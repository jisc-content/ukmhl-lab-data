C60 HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. The muscular branches of the perinaeal nerve will be seen as the dis- section proceeds. Dissection.—Remove the cellulo-fattj tissue and vessels and nerves from one side, say the left; also the thin layer of fascia which is above the muscles. The muscles superficial to the triangular ligament will then be exposed. There are three ; the one in the middle being the ejaculator urinae, that on the outer side is the erector penis, and a small muscle at the back part of the space, running nearly transversely inwards, is the transversus perinsei. These three muscles enclose the triangular space Fig. 481.—Superficial dissection op male perineum. The fascia removed on LEFT side. a. Skin. B. Eupf. fascia. C. Deep layer of snpf. fascia. D. Deep fascia. in which the superficial perinaeal muscles and nerves will be found, and beneath the transversalis the muscular branch of the perinaeal nerve should be defined. The Erector Penis, or Ischio-cavernosus, embraces the unattached part of the crus penis, and is naiTower at each end than in the middle. It arises by tendinous and fleshy fibres from the inner part of the tuber ischii, behind the attachment of the crus penis to it, and also from the pubic arch on either side of the crus. The fibres pass forwards to a ten-

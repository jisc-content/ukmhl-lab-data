HUMAN MOItPIIOLOGY. 14 MICBOSCOPIC ANATOMY. Marcellus Malpighi, born near Bologna in 1628 (died, 1694), Professor of Medicine at Bologna, and afterwards at Pisa, is justly regarded as the founder of Microscopic Anatomy ; for he was the first who in his researches greatly availed himself of the aid of the microscope. He first clearly described the structm'e of the tongue and of the skin, demonstrating that it is everywhere beset with delicate papillae, the chief organs of touch. He also discovered the rete mucosum {j'ete Malpighii), while his name is also associated with the Malpighian bodies in the spleen and kidneys. Malpighi was also the first who examined the circulation with the micro- scope. Among his chief works may be mentioned, ' De Cerebro;' 'De Lingua;' ' De Externo Tactus Organo ;' ' Marcelli Malpighi Opera Omnia,' London, 1686. Anton van Leuwenhoefif (born at Delft, 1638 ; died, 1723), and Johann Swammerdam (born at Amsterdam, 1637 ; died, 1680), acquired great repu- tation by their researches in natural history by means of the microscope. The latter introduced a new method of injecting the vesselsâ€”an art which was carried to great perfection by Frederick Euysch (born at the Hague, 1638; died in 1731). By this contrivance the arrangement of minute vessels became visible to the naked eye. There was scarcely any part of the human body Euysch did not inject, and he thus discovered many particulars relating to the minute structure of the lungs, the brain and its membranes, &c. By great labour Ruysch collected an anatomical museum, the first of the kind, which he sold in 1698 to Peter the Great for 30,000 florins. A considerable j^ortion of this museum became useless in conse- quence, it is said, of the sailors having drunk the spirits in which the specimens had been preserved (' Ruysch F. Opera Omnia Anatomico- Medico Chirurgica,' Amst. 1737, 5 vols. 4to.). Heinrich Meibom (Meibomius) (born at Helmstaet in 1590 ; died 1655) rediscovered the palpebral glands which bear his name (' De Vasis Palpe- brarum Novis Epistola,' Helmstaedt, 1666). Johann Conrad Brunner (born near Schaffhausen, in 1653 ; died in 1727) discovered the glands named after him (' De Glandulis Duodeni,' Heidelberg, 1687). Johannes Conrad Peyer (born at Schaffhausen, 1653; died, 1712) discovered and described the solitary and agminated glands which bear his name (' Exercitatio Anatomico-Medica de Glandulis Intestinorum,' Schaffhusii, 1677). Joseph-Guichard Duverney (1648-1730) and Raymond de Vieussens (1641-1715) are worthy representatives of French anatomy of this period. The former especially distinguished himself by his excellent treatise on the organ of hearing ('Traite de I'Organe de I'Ouie,' Paris, 1683), and the latter by the publication of his great work,' Neurologia Universalis,' Lyons, 1685. About this period, William Cowper (1666-1709) published his ' Myotomia Reforraata,'London, 1694. Cowper distinguished himself also by his minute account of the urethral glands, which, although already known, especially to jNIery, still bear Cowper's name. Edward Tyson (1649- 1708) deserves special mention as one of the first English physicians to whom comparative anatomy is much indebted (' The Anatomy of a Pigmy Compared with that of a Monkey, an Ape, and a Man,' London, 1699).

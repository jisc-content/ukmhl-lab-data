mSSSCTIOX OF THE UPrER LIMB. 277 The line of motion is nearly in a vertical plane, whose direction is slightly outwards, and owing to the oblique direction of the lower articular portion of the humerus, the hand falls inside the arm in complete flexion. Directions.—The student must first follow the reflexions of the syno- vial membrane, and then study the articular surfaces. The Synovial Membrane lines the inner surfaces of the ligaments, and passes from one bone to the other. It extends upwards on the humerus, and lines the coronoid and olecranon fossae, being vascular and loose in these positions. Below, it is prolonged between the lesser sigmoid cavity. Fig. 199. A. Front view of n, transverse vertical section through left elbow. B. A'ertical antero-postcrior sectioii through the trochlear and greater gignioid cavity. C. A similar section through the radius and capitellum. the inner surface of the orbicular ligament, and the circumference of the head and neck of the radius. It is, therefore, extensive. Direction.—Before dividing the posterior ligament and separating the bones, the dissector should seek the vessels and nerves to the joint and be familiar with its relations. The Arteries to the Joint come from the superior and inferior profundtc, anastomotic magna, recurrent radial, anterior and posterior ulnar recurrent and posterior interosseous recun-ent, and form a vascular circle around the articulation.

HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 474 of the interosseous membrdne. Its fibres run obliquely down and back, and end around a tendon which occupies the lower half of the posterior surface of the muscle. The tendon passes through a separate groove on the pos- terior surface of the tibia, external to the tendons of the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digitorum, being near the tendo-AchilUs. It then enters another groove on the posterior surface of the astragalus, and finally runs along a third groove beneath the lesser process of the os calcis, nearest its base, into the sole of the foot; it then passes between the two heads of and Fig. 351.â€”Left tibia and fibula. Posterior view. To show relations of tendons. the flexor brevis pollicis, and is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the great toe on its plantar aspect. In the sole it crosses above the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, being connected to it by a strong tendinous slip. The astragaloid and calcanean grooves for this tendon are converted into distinct canals by tendinous fibres. These canals are lined by synovial membrane. Relations.Su'perficially it is separated from the soleus by the deep fascia, and from the tendo-Achillis by the deep fascia and some vascular

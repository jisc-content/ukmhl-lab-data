HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 136 internally, the teres minor above and latissimus tlorsi and teres major beloW, to their origins from the axillary artery and posterior cord of the brachial plexus. In this space, a branch from the circumflex nerve to the teres minor muscle will be found near the scapular border surrounded by strong fibrous tissue. This branch has a gaiiglifurm enlargement on it. There are two circumfiex arteries, branches of the last part of the axillary trunk. They are anterior and posterior. The Anterior Circumfiex is a small vessel which passes transversely out beneath the coraco-brachialis and biceps, and in the bicipital groove divides into an ascending branch, which supplies the shoulder joint and Omoliyoid Lat. dorsi FiGk 65.â€”POSTERIOK BRANCHES OF BRACHIAL PLEXUS. RIGHT SIDE. the head of the humerus, and its continuation passes beneath the deltoid to supply it and anastomose with the posterior circumflex and acromial thoracic arteries. The Posterior Circumflex is a large vessel, and is given off opposite the lower border of the subscapularis. It passes backwards with the cir- cumflex veins and nerve through the quadrangular space, the boundai'ies of which have just been given. It winds round the neck of the humerus to supply the deltoid and shoulder joint, anastomosing with the anterior circumflex, supra-scapular and acromial thoracic arteries. It also supplies part of the teres miaor and the long head of the triceps, and gives cuta- neous twigs to the skin of the back of the shoulder. The Circumflex Nerve accompanies the posterior circumflex artery, and arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus usually in common with the musculo-spiral. It is behind the axillary artery and in front of

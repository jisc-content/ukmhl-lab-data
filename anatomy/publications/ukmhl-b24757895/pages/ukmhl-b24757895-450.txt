HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 414 muscle resembles the deltoid of the arm in formiug a prominence protect- ing the joint also in its coarse texture. There are usually three synovial bursse beneath it; one of large size and generally multilocular separates it from the great trochanter; another exists between its tendon and the origin of the vastus externus; and a third, which is inconstant, is situated over the tuber ischii. Relation.—Its superficial relations are unimportant and have already been given. Its deep relations will be seen on reflecting the muscle and after a little cleaning. They are from above downwards.

The muscles are the posterior third of the gluteus medius; the pyriformis, gemelli, obturator internus, quadratus femoris, the origins of the biceps, semi-tendinosas, semi-membranosus, and adduc- tor magnus. The vessels are the gluteal artery and vein above the pyriformis, and below it the sciatic and internal pudic vessels and nerves, and nerve to the obturator internus muscle. The superior gluteal nerve accompanies the gluteal artery above the pyriformis. The upper border is connected with the gluteus medius ; its lower border is free, is longer and thicker than the upper, and beneath it the sciatic vessels and nerves and the origins of the hamstring muscles issue.

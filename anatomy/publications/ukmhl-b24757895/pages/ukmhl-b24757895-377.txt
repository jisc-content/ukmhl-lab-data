DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. feriioral vein about lui inch and a half below the ilio-pubic ligament. This vein is joined in the foot by the internal plantar, and in the leg by the posterior tibial veins, by branches which perforate the tibial head of the soleus. It also comnaunicates with the anterior tibial veins, receives some articular branches at the inner side of the knee, and in the thigh, one or more branches pass between it and the femoral vein. The cuta- neous veins of the thigh empty themselves into it near the saphenous opening by two or three large trunks formed by the veins from the outer, Fig. 237.—Right internal saphena vein and its tributaries. inner, and posterior surfaces. Near its termination it receives the super- ficial epigastric, superficial circumflex ihac, and superior external pudic. Its valves vary from two to six, and there are more in the thigh than in the leg. The external saphenous vein will be dissected with the leg. Dissection.—The fascia lata must now be cleaned, especially at the npper part. On removing the deep layer of the superficial fascia the Saphenous opening of the fascia lata will be seen. Its outer semilunar edge is to be separated from the superficial fascia, and from the anterior

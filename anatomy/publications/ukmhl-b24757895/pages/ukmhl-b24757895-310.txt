It passes, from the end and back part of the inner condyle to the inner border of the olecranon. The anterior piece passes downwards and forwards and the posterior down and back, A few middle fibres join a transverse ligamentous band which crosses the notch between the ole- cranon and the coronoid process. It is in relation, intervially, with the ulnar nerve, posterior ulnar recurrent artery, the triceps and flexor caqji ulnaris ; and externally, with the synovial membrane. Small articular vessels and nerves enter the joint hy openings beneath the transverse band. Dissection.—To expose the articular surfaces, the anterior and lateral ligaments must be divided near their upper attachments and the bones Medullary caiinl of humerus ....-<^\V Triceps Humenis compact tissue Bracli. aut. cut Ext. car)), ulu.

Movements.—As already stated, this articulation is a simple hinge joint, and permits only of flexion and extension. The formation of the humeral trochlear surface with its eminences and depressions, which are arcuately fitted to the opposing surfaces of the sigmoid cavity of the ulna, prevents any great amount of lateral motion. In Flexion the radius and ulna move towards the humerus and leave the posterior part of the humeral articular surface uncovered. It is checked,

HISTORICAL SKETCH. 15 Samuel Collins, the contemporary of Tyson, published about the same time an important work bearing the title ' Systenia Anatomicum of the Body of Man, Birds, Beasts, Fishes,' &c., London, 1685. Antonio-Marca FaisaZm (1660-1723), the pupil of Malpighi, J. D. Santonni (1681-1737), and J. B. 3Io7-gar/ni (1682-1771), were at that period the representatives of anatomy in Italy. The treatise of Valsalva on the human ear (' De Aiu-e Humani Tractatus,' &c., Bologna, 1704) was the most complete which had heretofore appeared on tliat subject. San- torini's anatomical observations (' Observationes Anatomicse,' Venet. 1724) on the muscles of the face (risorius Santorini), on the brain, the organs of generation (circular fibres of Santorini), are all distinguished by their precision and novelty. Morgagni (1682; died, 1771), although better known and more appreciated as a pathological anatomist from his great work,' Pe Sedibus et Causis Morborum' (Naples, 1761), and his ' Adversaria Anatomica' (Padua, 1741), proved a copious spring from which succeeding anatomists abundantly helped themselves. Bernard Siegfried Albinus (1697-1770) greatly distinguished himself by the publication of his magnificent works, 'De Ossibus Corporis Humani,' Lugd. Batav. 1726, and especially by his ' Historia Musculorum Hominis,' Lugd. Batav. 1734. In this latter work he properly classified the muscles and a^iplied to them names most of which have been adopted by anato- mists. In association with Albinus must be mentioned his great pupil and successor, Albert Haller of Bern (1708-1777). Although the reputation of Haller chiefly rests upon his great work on physiology (' Elementa Phy- siologica Corporis Humani,' Lausanne, 1757), he, nevertheless, contributed largely to the progress of anatomy by the publication of various anatomical dissertations, among which may be mentioned ' Opera Minora Emendata, Aucta et Eenovata Anatomica,' &c., 3 vols., Lausanne, 1762-1768. Johann Friedrich Meckel (1713-1774), a favourite pupil of Haller, among other works, published a masterly description of the facial nerves, ' Tractatus de Quinto Pare Nervorum Cerebri,' Groett. 1748. Johann Gott- fried Zinn (1727-1759) piiblished an important treatise on the eye, ' Descriptio Anatomica Ocidi Humani,' &c., Groettingen, 1755. A second and much improved edition of this work was published by Wrisberg in 1780. Heinrich Aug. Wrisberg (1739-1808), Haller's successor at Groettingen, published a number of anatomical treatises, among which may be men- tioned ' Observat. Anatomico-Neurologicarum de Nervis,' &c., Groett. 1800 (Wrisberg's ganglionâ€”nerve of Wrisberg). Peter Camper (1722-1789), now chiefly known by his 'facial angle,' published a large number of treatises on com])arative anatomy. His work, ' Demonstrationum Anatomico-Pathologicarum,' La Hay, 1760-62, is full of interesting remarks on the anatomy of the arm and the pelvis and their incidental diseases. WiUv.un Hiinier (1718-1783) was the author of numeroas essays in the 'Pliilo.^ophical Transactions.' ILis i)rincipal work, on which he was engaged for many years, is his' Anatomical Description of the Gravid Uterus,' illustrated with thirty-four ])lates, Birmingliam, 1774. John Hnvter (1728-1793), the younger brother of William IJunter, equally distinguished as anatomist and [jhysician, contributed largely to the ' Transactions of the Koyal Society.' His museum at the College of Surgeons, illustrative of human and comparative structure, sufficiently establishes his rank as an

It ends in a long tendon which passes behind the outer malleolus, beneath the external annular ligament, in a groove which is common to it and the peroneus brevis. It then passes obliquely forwards across the outer side of the os calcis, below the peroneus brevis, and in a separate fibrous sheath. Then it runs in a slight groove on the outer side of the cuboid, and finally in a deep groove on the under surface of that bone, which groove is converted into a canal by the long calcaneo-cuboid ligament, and is inserted into the internal cuneiform and Branches saph.

This portion' of the muscle has been seen in the dissection of the sole. Relations.—In the leg it is immediately beneath the fascia and rests on the peroneus brevis. Its tendon rests on the middle piece of the external lateral ligament of the ankle with that of the peroneus brevis, one synovial membrane being common to both tendons. In front of it is the origin of the extensor longus digitorum, and tlie soleus is attached to the fibula behind it. Action.-r-lt extends the foot upon the leg and raises its outer border.

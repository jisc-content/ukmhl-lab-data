HUMAN MOIiPHOLOGY. 220 to the radius ; and still more external, lying upon the supinator brevis, and partly concealed by the supinator longus, is the musculo-spiral nerve. The radial recurrent artery'is near the 'musculo-spiral on the out er side and the anterior ulnar recm-rent is internal to the median nerve. The lymphatic glands lie on the sides of the brachial artery, and one just below its bifurcation between the radial and ulnar. Muscles on the Front of the Forearm.—These are divided into a superficial and deep layer. There are five in the superficial layer wliich ai'ise from the inner humeral condyle mostly by a common tendon. They Fig. 137.—Superficial muscles of the front of the left foeeakji. are the superficial flexors and pronators, and from within outwards are the pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor carpi ulnaris; and deeper and bigger than any of these is the flexor sublimis digitorum. These are the superficial muscles of the anterior brachial region. The Pronator Radii Teres is the most external of the group, and arises by two heads. The larger and more superficial comes from the upper part of the inner condyle, from the common tendon, intermuscular septum, and deep fascia. The second head is a thin fasciculus, deeply placed,

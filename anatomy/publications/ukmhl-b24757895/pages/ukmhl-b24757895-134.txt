The glands vai-y in number and size, but there are usually ten or twelve with small blood-vessels from the branches of the axillary vessels to them. The glands at the side of the blood-vessels receive the lymphatics of the arm, but the lymphatics of the posterior surface of the back, from the forepart of the thorax and the outer portion of the mamma, empty them- selves into the glands along the hinder boundary of the axilla. Most of the efferent ducts from these gLands join to form a trunk which empties itself into the lymphatic duct of the same size at the root of the neck, but some may separately empty into the subclavian vein.

Surgical Anatomy.â€”The dissector should attentively study the rela- tions of the important vessels and nerves in this space, because there is frequent need of surgical interference in this region. The third part of the axillary artery may have to be secured, or the nerves may have to be cut down upon and stretched. Tumours may have to be extirpated in this region, and the lymphatic glands are frequently removed when they are enlai'ged either during or after the operation of extirpation of the breast for cancer or sarcoma. The tliird part of the axillary artery may have to be compressed by the fingers (digital compression), or by a tourniquet, in amputation through the arm high up, and by knowing the position and relations of the vessels, the best and easiest mode in which i<- may be com-

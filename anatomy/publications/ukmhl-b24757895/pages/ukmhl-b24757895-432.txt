HUMAN MORrilOLOGY. 396 Varieties.—It is frequently divided into two or three parts, and it may be incorporated with the inagnus. Relations.—Anteriorly, are the pectineus, adductor longus, anterior branches of the obturator vessels and nerve, and the profunda vessels; posteriorly, with the adductor inagnus, posterior branches of the obturator vessels and nerve, and a branch of the internal circumflex artery.

Anterior view. 16,17, 18,19. Branches of obturator to add. long., brcv., and gracilis : the latter divides and anastomoses with int. saph. and tlie deep branch of int. cut. 21. Lumbo-sacral joining first sacral. passes between it and the obturator externus. Its inner and lower borders with the gracilis and adductor magnus. It is pierced neai- its insertion by the middle perforating branch of the profunda artery. Action.—It adducts the femur, and flexes the hip, and acting from below, will draw the pelvis forwards and assist the upper iibres of the inag- nus and the longus in rotating the pelvis to its own side.

In front they become narrow and approach each other, and are inserted on the corpora cavernosa of the clitoris, a fas- ciculus passing over these and enclosing the venae dorsalis. Action.—This resembles that of other orbicular muscles, and diminishes the vaginal orifice. Its action is, however, in most subjects feeble. But in certain diseased conditions there is great spasm of this muscle, to which the term vaginismus is applied. It also assists in fixing the central perinseal point.

The subpubic fascia or triangular ligament is not so strong as in the male, and is perforated by the urethra. It is pai-tly interrupted behind by the vaginal aperture. Dissection.—'Remove the superficial layer of this fascia, as in themale, to expose the deep muscles and pubic vessels and nerves and their branches. The description given in the dissection of the male perinteum will serve for these structures, with the following exceptions :

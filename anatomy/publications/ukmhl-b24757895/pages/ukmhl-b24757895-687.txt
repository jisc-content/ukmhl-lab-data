DISSECTION OF THE VERINMUM. 651 Veins.—These are the vena3 comites of the arteries, and empty them- selves into the internal pndic vein, which ends in the internal iliac vein. Nerves.—Corresponding and similarly named branches to those of the artery issue from the pudic or internal pudic nerve, which, like the artery, supplies nearly all the structures in these regions. A filament from the fom'th sacral, and some cutaneous branches of the small sciatic, are also found in this fossa. On the back of the coccyx is the fifth sacral, and at its sides and near its tip are the coccygeal nerves. The Pudic or internal pudic nerve comes from the third and foxirth ext.

It then passes forward, and ends as the dorsal nerve of the penis. The Inferior hcemorrhoidal nerve arises from the pudic at the back of the pelvis, or may issue directly from the sacral plexus. In the latter case it passes through the small sacro-sciatic foramen. It crosses the fossa and supplies the external sphincter and skin around it. Some cutaneous fila- ments pass forwards and anastomose at the thigh mai-gin with the inferior pudendal of the small sciatic and with the posterior supplemental perinaeal offsets of the pudic.

It has a pair of valves opposite the lower border of the subscapularis, and valves where the subscapular and cephalic vein debouch into it. It is continued upwards into the subclavian vein. It anastomoses with the superficial veins of the neck and thorax and abdomen, and also with the femoral vein.

Varieties.—It is rare to find an anomaly in.the trunk of the vein, but one or two veins corres]ionding to the branches of the artery may enter into the subscapular, basilic, or circumflex veins, instead of into it. I once saw two large axillary veins which united to form the subclavian, and I

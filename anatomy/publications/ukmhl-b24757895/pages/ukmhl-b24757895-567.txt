DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. The student must first study the origin and distribution of the cutaneous nerves, and then the attaeliments of the deep fascia. The Internal Saphenoati nerve is a continuation of the nerve which has already been dissected in the thigh, and accompanies the vein of the same name along the inner side of the leg, passing behind the inner border of the tibia, and at the lower tliird of the leg divides into two branches ; one passes on along the inner tibial margin ending at the inner ankle, the other passes in front of the ankle with the vein and supplies the skin along the inner side of the foot as far as the metatarso-phalangeal joint. Some twigs from this branch pierce the deep fascia to sujiply some of the tarsal joints. The External Saphenous nerve, from the internal popliteal, will be seen behind the outer malleolus in company with the vein, and passes Fig. 410.â€”Cutaneous nerves of outer side of Riem leg. along the outer side of the foot and little toe which it supplies. It gives ofiFsets on the dorsum and to the sole, the latter being the larger. Some- times it supplies both sides of the little toe and the outer part of the next. The Cutaneous Branches of the External Popliteal are two or three in number, and are found on the outer side of the leg as far as its middle or lower third. . The Musculo-culaneous nerve pierces the deep fascia on the front and outer side of the leg at its lower third. It is usually accompanied by a cutaneous artery, and divides shortly after having perforated the fascia into an inner and outer branch. The internal branch passes in front of the ankle and along the dorsum of the foot to supply the inner side of the M M 2

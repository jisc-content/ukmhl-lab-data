DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. 299 The student will note that there are five synovial membranes about the wrist: 1, The viembrana sacciformis which lines the upper surface of the fibro-cartilage, the sigmoid cavity of the radius, and the head of the ulna ; 2 lines the lower end of the radius and fibro-cartilage and the upper surfaces of the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform; 3, is the largest and covers the contiguous surfaces of the two rows of carpal bones, sending two processes up and three downwards between the bones, the latter lining the carpal ends of the four inner metacarpal and sending down three pouches between their bases; 4, is for the trapezio-metacarpal joint; and 5, for the cuueo-pisiform articulation. Occasionally an interosseous ligament shuts Fio. 225.—The bones op the female hand. (Marshall.) off the joint of the unciform with the metacarpals, forming a sixth synovial cavity ; and rarely the intercarpal synovial membrane communicates with the radio-carpal one through deficiency of one of the interosseous ligaments. Directions.—With a fine saw, the dissector should now make various longitudinal and transverse sections through the bones and joints, so as more completely to understand them and to become familiar with the thickness and extent of the articular cartilages and arrangement of the periosteum, which he should, in parts, separate from the bone and observe the vessels entering the latter. He will thus become acquainted with the structure and mechanism of the bones and joints, and learn at what pai-ts ^hey are strong or weak.

647 DISSECTION OF THE PERINJEUM. anterior border of the ischio-coccygeus. The muscles of opposite sides are separated in front by a triangidar interval in which is the triangular liga- ment, and through this pass the urethra in the male, and vagina in the female. Nerves.—From the internal pudic and third and fourth sacral nerves, which latter pierce or pass between it and the ischio-coccygeus; it has also some twigs from the anterior superficial perinteal nerve. The Ischio-coccygeus.—Some anatomists say that this is only the posterior part of the levator ani, but as it is often pretty distinct, I shall describe it as a separate muscle. It arises from the posterior part of the Fig. 468 —Muscles of the pelvic diaphragm, seen from below. ■ The sciatic vessels and nerves arc shown cut, coming out in front of the pjTiformis. tendinous arch or white line of the pelvic fascia, and is inserted into the side of the coccyx and into the ano-coccygeal raphe. Action.—It assists the posterior part of the levator ani. Nerve.—The same as that of the levator ani. The Coccygeus, levator, or spino-coccygeus, is situated between the posterior border of the levator ani and the small sciatic ligament. Its under surface may be seen by removing a portion of the gluteus maximus of one side, so as to expose the great sacro-sciatic ligament. This may be divided at its middle and reflected. Some of the fibres of the gluteus

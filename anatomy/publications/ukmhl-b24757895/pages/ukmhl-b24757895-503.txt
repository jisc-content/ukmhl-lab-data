The outer head arises from the upper and outer part of the external condyle, above the attachment of the popliteus. This muscle is tendinous along the middle. Each tendon expands into an aponeurosis which covers the posterior surface of that part of the muscle pertaining to it. The aponeurosis covering the inner head is longer and thicker than Fig. 317.—Superficial dissection of outer side of left knee. that investing the outer. Muscular fibres arise from the anterior surface of these expansions. The fibres in the mid-line, corresponding to the portions of muscle arising from the bifurcations of the linea aspera, unite along a median, thin aponeurosis, below. The remaining fibres converge to the posterior aspect of an aponeiuosis which extends on the front of the muscle, and this, gradually protracting, joins with the tendon of the soleus, forming the tendo-Achillis, which will be presently dissected.

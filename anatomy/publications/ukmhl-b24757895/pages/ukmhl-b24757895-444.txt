The upper arc is formed by the iliac crest, the lower by the in- ferior border of the gluteus maximus covered by the skin and fat. The condition of this region with regard to the amount of fat, and with refer- ence to its firmness or flaccidity, varies with the general state of health. Sex also alters the shape of the part. In the male, the buttock is rounder and firmer; in the female, it is larger and more dependent. Eacial pecu- liarity must also be named.

This latter when enlarged or inflamed (which is not uncommonly the case in people who ride much) has been called consequently 'The Eider's Bursa.' The bursa which is found over the great trochanter enlarges frequently in tailors through being exposed to pressui-e by their sitting on

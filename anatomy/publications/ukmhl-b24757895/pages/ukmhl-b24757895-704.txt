668 HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. Each gland is of about the size of a pea, and consists of lobules held together by connective tissue. The lobules aie made up of small vesicles which are lined by squamous epithelium. The duct of each gland is nearly an inch in length, and is minute. It obliquely perforates the corpus spongiosum, and opens into the m'ethra about half an inch in front of the triangular ligament. In its wall are unstriped muscular fibres, and Fig. 488.—Diagram of vertical transverse section through the PBRiK-iEAL FASCIA AND BULB. its mucous lining is covered by columnar epithelium. In old men they are much decreased in size. Directions.—The anterior. pai'ts of the pudic vessels and nerves and their branches must be now traced out. The nerve accompanies the artery, but is more deeply placed. The Pudic, or Internal Pudic Artery, is the smaller of the two terminal branches of the anterior division of the internal ihac, and is destined for the supply of the perinieum and external genital organs. It is smaller in the female. Its posterior portion in the perinteum has already been dis- sected. Its anterior part, after piercing the posterior layer of the deep perinseal fascia runs forwards between the layers of that fascia along the

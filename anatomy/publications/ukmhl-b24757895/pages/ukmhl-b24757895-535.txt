nHSSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. m K K 2 Actions.—The action of this muscle has been given in the dissection of the back of the leg, and it will be further alluded to when speaking of the flexor accessorius. The Lumbricales are four small muscles accessory to the tendons of the long flexor. Excepting the most internal, each arises from two tendons. The innermost arises from the inner side of the innermost tendon, viz. that for the second toe. They terminate in tendons which pass on the inner side of each of the four outer toes, and are inserted into the inner or tibial side of the bases of the metatarsal phalanges of the four outer toes, sending an expansion to the long extensor. The outer muscles are smaller than the inner. Fig. 375.—Muscles of right foot, middle layer. Actions.—They assist the flexors ih bending the metatarso-phalangeal jomts of the four lesser toes, but the tendons from which they arise must be fixed before they contract. Nerves.—The two inner are supplied by the internal plantar, and the two outer by the external. T.he Plexor Accessorius arises by two heads which are separated by the long plantar ligament; the inner or larger head is muscular, and is fixed to the inner concave surface of the os calcis and to the calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. The outer head is flat and tendinous, and arises from the under

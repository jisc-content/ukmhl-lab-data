Inside there is either a separate one under the tendon of the semimembranosus or an expansion from the inner gastrocnemius bursa. This is in contact with the posterior ligament, and often communicates with the joint. Another bursa exists Recti! 5 Suberureua Femur Supra-patellar pouch Patella Bursa patellie Infra-patell. fat Lig. pateUiB Bursa behind lig. pateUffi Tibia Tib'. aiit». Tent], of .semitcnd. Semimemb.

Inner part of section which is slightly external to mid-line. The vessels are shown passing under the fibrous arch of the soleus. between the tendon of the semimembranosus and the head of the tibia, and frequently one between the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus. It is of great practical importance to remember which of these bursas are most commonly in communication with the joint, as eflfusions into them are not of infrequent occurrence. Two sesamoid bones, or fibro-cartilages, may be found (and occasionally three) in relation with the joint; one is in the outer head of the gastrocnemius, and the other in the tendon of the popliteus. A third sometimes exists in the inner head of the gastrocnemius. They very riirely ossify.

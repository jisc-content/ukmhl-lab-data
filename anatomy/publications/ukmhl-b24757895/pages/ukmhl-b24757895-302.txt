HUMAN MOIirilOLOGY. 266 abductor poliicis and first dorsal interosseous, to the base of the first phalanx, where it divides into the two collateral branches of the thumb. These run aldng the sides of its palmar aspect, and form an arch on the under-surface of the last phalanx, from which branches supply the skin and cellular tissue of the thumb and anastomose with the dorsales poUicis. The Radialis Indicis arises close to the preceding, passing over the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and between it and the adductor poliicis, and beneath the flexor brevis, to the radial side of the index finger as far as its end, where it joins the digital branch of the superficial palmar arch. 1.

The anastomoses on the digits and between tlie carpals of radial and ulnar, and the recurrents of the deep arch, are depicted. The fij-st dorsal and three palmar interossei, the abductor and flexor brevis miu. dig. are shown. It is usually connected tit the free or anterior border of the adductor poliicis with the superficial palmar arch and with the princeps poliicis. Recurrent Branches go from the convexity of the arehj and anastomose with the anterior carpals of the radial and ulnar arteries, and supply the carpal bones and joints. The Perforating Arteries are three; they pass between the heads of the three inner dorsal interossei, and anastomose with the dorsal inter- osseous arteries. The Palmar Interosseous are usually three, but there may be four. They lie in the three inner metacarpal spaces running forwards on the corresponding interossei muscles, which they supply, as well as the two or

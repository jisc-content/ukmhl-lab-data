Relation of Parts.—The dissector must now make himself conversant with the limits and contents of the space. The Popliteal Space is bounded above the joint on the inner side by the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, semi-tendinosus, semi-membranous, and deeply by the tendon of the abductor magnus. Internally below the joint by the inner head of the gastrocnemius ; externally above the joint by the biceps and outer head of the gastrocnemius and plantaris; externally be- loiv the joint by the outer head of the gastrocnemius. This space occupies the loiver-third oi the femur on its posterior aspect between the bifurca- FiG. 313.—Dissection of left popliteal space. Altered from Godlee. tion of the linea aspera, and extends as far as the upper-fifth of the pos- terior aspect of the tibia. It is covered in by the skin, superficial fascia and fat,- and deep fascia. The floor is formed by the posterior-third of the femur, just mentioned, the ligamentuin posticum Winslowii, and upper part of the popliteal muscle covered by its fascia or aponeurosis. While cleaning the space the student will find in the mid-line the large internal popliteal nerve, and on the outer side, in near connection with the biceps tendon, will be found the external popliteal or peroneal nerve. Branches from both these nerves, especially from the inner, may be traced from above downwards. They will be found to accompany the

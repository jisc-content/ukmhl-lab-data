HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 64 to fix the arterial wall on the ridge of the tube; and the third is only tightened after the injection is completed, and serves to prevent the exit of the material which has been injected into the arteries. The cannula being in place, the body should be put into a hot bath of a temperature of 33°, for from four to six hours, according to the time of year, and longer for a big corpse than for a small one. Six hours at least will be needed in the winter. From two to three hours is enough for a child. The cannula should be closed with a cork before the subject is placed in a bath; and the injection can be made under water, if it be desired to exclude the air and to distend the deeper vessels.^ Fig. 14.—injection syringe (reduced in size). 1. Cannula. 2 aud 3. Stopcock tubes. To their left is a haudle. It is not necessary in warm weather to make use of a bath, as the body can be sufficiently injected for coarse anatomical pm-poses without this preliminary step. There is a little intermediate apparatus, fitted with a stopcock, one end of which fits mto the broad end of the cannula, and the other receives he nozzle of the syringe. The cannula and the stopcock tube should be kept warm dming injection in cold weather, by placing a flannel wrung out ot hot water _ai-ound them, or by allowing hot water to drop on to the tube during the injection process, so as to prevent the coagulation of the solidihabie materials m the injection mass. The injection mass having been prepared, and the syringe wanned, the stopcock should be placed parallel with the length of the syringe, and

Injection of Veins.—These may also be complete or partial, and the bodies of old people are the most favomuble, as in them the venous system is well developed. To succeed in the injection of the veins, it is almost indispensable to perform a previous hydrotomy, otherwise there will always remain some blood in the veins, and the injection will not succeed. To inject the entire venous system one must proceed in an opposite manner to that adopted for the arteries ; for, if a big venous trunk be injected, the liquid will not reach the small veins because of the numerous valves which obstruct the flow of the latter. The steps for preparing the injection, and tying in the cannula, &c., are the same as those just described, but it is necessary to have two Fig. 16.—Faeabeuf's injecting apparatl's in posmoN as used in the Paris Faculty of MediciniS. cannulce for each foot and hand, in order to inject the venous system satis- factorily. The cannulce must be of small caliber, and should be introduced into the veins on the inner and outer side of the dorsum of the hand, as well as into the cephalic vein of the thumb; and, on the dorsum of the foot, into the veins forming the venous arch, or into the external and internal saphena veins. By these means the whole venous system, with the exception of the portal vein, can be injected. The steps of the injection and the ingredients of the injection mass have already been given, but the colouring matter for the veins is usually a blue one. As the vein walls are very thin, one must be careful not to pass the cannula between the outer and middle tunics, and the correct position of the instrument will be recognised by passing a fine wire along it.

Glvceriue 100 parts (Carbolic acid . . . . . . • 15-17 „ Alcohol 11 )> Chromic acid in from 2 to 5 per cent, solution, and bichromate of potash in 5 to 7 per cent, solution, are good conservative injections; as also is Miiller's fluid, which consists of: 12. Bichromate of potash 2-2|^ grammes Sulphate of soda ...... 1 „ Aq. destill 100 „ The following are very good preservative injections, and number 14 may be injected as a hot mixture without j)reviously warming the body. When this is desired to be done the mixture must be quite hot and fluid, and the injection should be done rapidly. After injection the body should be left for twenty-four hours at the ordinary temperature, and then th^ usual mixture of wax, tallow, oil, and turpentine, coloured with cinna- bar or some other colouring matter, should be injected. About 15 pounds of the mixtm-e will be sufficient for a body. 13. Alcohol of 96 per cent q.s. Corrosive sublimate to satm-atiou 14.

If more arsenic be added the longer will the body be preserved. Goadby's liquid, which is a good preservative, consists of : 16.

Farrant's fluid is composed of: White arsenic . , . .0-11 gramme Dissolved in 35 grammes of boiling distilled water. When cool the solution is mixed with an equal weight of glycerine, and also with an equal weight of the best gum arabic. Another good conservative fluid is composed of: 17.

Salicylic acid, the sulpho-carbolates, thymol, nitrate of amyl, chlorozone, camphor, tannin, pyrogallic acid, iron alum, saturated solution of common salt, and sulphur make excellent additions to, or substitutes for, the

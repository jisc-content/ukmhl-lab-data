HUMAN MORniOL 0 G Y. 40 and hand with the fingers. These will be described in a subsequent part of the work, but it may here be mentioned that the forearm is longer in men, that the hand equals in length a fourth of the whole length of the upper limb, and also is said to equal the distance between the ends of the upper incisors and the vertex of the skull, also the distance from the occipital protuberance to the root of the nose, the distance from the inter- clavicular notch to the acromion, and is the third of the length of the spine, the sacrum not being included. It appears thus to be a true unit for the measm-e of the human body. It is irregularly quadrangular and its form varies in individuals, but maybe redaced to two fundamental types: 1, the masculine, in which the transverse diameters preponderate ; and 2, the feminine type, in which all the measurements are smaller. lower Extremity.—Its length is about one-iifth greater than that of the upper, and it is proportionately smaller in women. It is divisible into the hip, thigh, knee, leg, ankle, and foot with the toes, the surface mark- ings of which will be given in the dissection of these regions. Proportionate Weight of the Body-parts.— A great number of circum- stances modify the development of the human body, such as hereditary influences, climate, food, hygienic surroundings, exercise, regimen, &c., and the result of these various influences is patent to the observant eye at any hour of the day. Several attempts have been made to reduce these variations into definite laws, and for the numerous observations which have from time to time been made to ascertain the average stature, weight, and capacity in European countries, the student, should he be interested in anthropology, or in medico-legal subjects, must refer to the works of Quetelet, Tenon, Eiecke, Krause, Hoffmann, Liebig and Eischoft', and Eoberts on Anthropometry; but it may be of use to the student to give, in this connection, Krause's recent table. The measurements are expressed in fractions of a metre, the average height of man being es- timated at 1'67 metre. !Maii Woiimii III. in. l-7;37 1-629 0-875 0-848 0-U92 0-G51 Height of the body From the vertex to the end of the coccj-x. jj „ „ uuibiliciis Head.

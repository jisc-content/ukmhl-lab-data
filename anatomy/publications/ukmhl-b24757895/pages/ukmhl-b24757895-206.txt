iro HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. Not infrequently it joins the median or may Le a branch of it. Sonaetimes it does not pierce the coraco-brachiahs. Dissection.—Cut through the biceps tendon near the elbow, and reflect the muscle upwards. Clean the surface of the brachialis anticus, and define its lateral attachments. The Brachialis Anticus is a broad muscle compressed from before back, and is narrower at its extremities than in the middle. It arises from the anterior and lower half of the outer and inner surfaces of the humeral shaft, and embraces by two j^rocessesthe insertion of the deltoid. Its origin extends to within an inch of the lower articular surface of the humerus, Fig. 95.—Muscles of front of arm and scapula. and it also arises from both intermuscular septa, but more extensively fi'om the inner. Its fibres converge to a thick tendon, which is inserted into a rough impression on the anterior surface of the coronoid process of the ulna, in an interval between two fleshy origins of the flexor profun- dus digitarum. Relations.—In front with the biceps, the brachial vessels, musculo- cutaneous, and median nerves, and above the deep fascia with the cephalic and basilic veins, and the veins and nerves in front of the bend of the

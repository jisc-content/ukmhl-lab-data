The Internal Plantar Artery ia small, and runs along the inner border of the foot with the internal plantar nerve. It passes from above the ab- ductor pollicis to between it and the flexor brevis digitorum, supplying both, to the third interosseous space. At the base of the first metatarsal bone it is very small and passes along the inner side of the great toe, anastomosing with its digital branch, and also with the third digital artery from the external plantiu*. ■ Branches.—It gives muscular offsets to the two muscles just mentioned, and also to the two inner lumbricales. Offsets pass to the Tend. Fig. 308.—Right plantar nervks and arteries.

It also fumishes/our digital Jmmches accompanying those of the internal plantar nerve. The first digital passes to the inner side of the foot and great toe. The second to the first interosseous space, the third to the second s})ace, and the fourth, which is the termination of the artery, to the third space. At the roots of the toes the three outer ones join the deeper digital arteries from the external plantar. The External Plantar Artery, tlio larger, passes obliquely forwards and outwards to the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, and then turns oblicpiely

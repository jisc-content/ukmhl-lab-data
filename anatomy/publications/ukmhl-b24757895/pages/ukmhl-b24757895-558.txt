HUMAN MORniOLOGY. 522 in front of the tibial spine, opposite the anterior crucial ligament, which it touches, and close to the inner margin of the outer articular surface; and its posterior end is fixed between and behind the two osseous points of the tibial spine. It is less closely joined to the capsule than the interaal, as its anterior part is neai'er the centre of the joint, and the tendon of the popliteus separates it behind from the capsular ligament. This fibro- cartilage has some accessory bands. The one given off from its anterior border is the trcmsverse lirjament. Its posterior extremity divides into Fig. 402.—Vertical antero-pobterior section of the knee joint to show the action of the crucial ligaments. A, Anterior crucial in extension. A.Infle>dou. B.

The third fasciculus is inserted into the back of the anterior crucial ligament. Use.—These structures deepen the hollows on the upper surface ,of the tibia for the reception of the femoral, condyles, and fill the interval be- tween the bones and the joint circumference. They act also as buffers in moderating pressure and in diminishing shocks. They move forwards and backwards with the tibia in extension and flexion, lu the former motion

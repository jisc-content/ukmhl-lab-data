The concavity of this arch is tm-ned inwards. It will be seen that this artery crosses the foot twice, first from within outwards and then in the opposite direction. Relations.â€”In the first half of its course, viz. from the inner side of the OS calcis to the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, it is comparatively superficial, being placed at fii'st between the calcaneum and the abductor pollicis, and then between the flexor brevis digitorum and flexor acces- Abd.liaU, lilt, plantar nerve.

In the rest of its extent it is deeply placed, lying upon the inter- osseous muscles opposite the bases of the metatarsal bones, covered by the adductor pollicis, the flexor tendons of the toes, and the lumbricales. In this part the arch is convex forwards. Only the superficial part of the artery is now seen. It is accompanied by vense comites and the external plantar nerve, which is first on its outer side and crosses above it to reach

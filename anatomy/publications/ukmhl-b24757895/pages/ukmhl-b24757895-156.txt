Dissection.—Draw the arm away from the trunk so as to separate the scapula from the thorax, cut through the brachial plexus opposite the third rib, and clean the serratus magnus muscle. . The Serratus Magniis is a broad and irregularly quadrilateral muscle, passing from the upper part and side of the thorax to the scapula. It arises by nine pointed fleshy digitations from the outer surfaces and upper borders of the eight upper ribs (the second rib having two), about two Fig. 53.—Diagram to show the origin of the serratus magnus. inches from their cartilages; also from the aponeurosis over the upper intercostals. The fibres approximate to be inserted into the whole length of the inner margin of the posterior border of the scapula. In consequence of the difference in their direction and extent of attachment, the fibres of this muscle have been described as consisting of three parts—a superior, middle, and inferior. The upper portion, which is slightly separated from the middle, is narrow and thick, and arises by ttoo digitations from the first and second ribs, and an aponeurotic arch between them. It

UISSECTION OF THE PEltlNJEUM. 643 The outer wall is immovable, hut the inner one changes with the con- traction or relaxation of the levator ani, and shortens and becomes ten&e when this muscle contracts, or elongates and approaches the skin when it is in a state of rest. Directions.—Having mastered the shape, size, boundaries, and actions of the boundaries of this space, the student must proceed to study the contmts of the opposite fossa. These are the vessels and nerves to the lower part of the rectum and to the anus; they are all branches of the internal pudic artery and nerve. A branch of the fourth sacral nerve, and Fig. 465.—Dissection showing the boundakies of the eight ischio-rectal fossa and the sepaeation between it and the pelvis, The right osinnomlnatnm is sawn yertically through the acetabulum. one from the inferior or long pudendal from the small sciatic nerve, will also be seen. Before doing this it will be well to learn the attachments of the muscles bounding the space. Three of these muscles are con- nected with the lower end of the rectum, viz. the external sphincter, levator ani, and internal sphincter. The corrugator cutis ani is a slender subcutaneous muscle, and comes first into view. Muscles.—The corrugator cutis ani surrounds the anus, is very thin and subcutaneous, and composed of involuntary radiating fibres; it passes from the rectal submucous tissue to the skin external to the sphincter, T T 2

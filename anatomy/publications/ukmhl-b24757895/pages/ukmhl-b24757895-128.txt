The posterior branches decrease from above downwards, and supply the skin over the latissimus dorsi and scapula. The lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal is larger than the others, and pierces the axillary fascia to supply the skin on the inner side of the arm, and is called the intercosto-humeral nerve. It is divided into two or more pieces as it crosses the axilla, and joins the nerve of "Wrisberg, and piercing the deep fascia supplies the skin of the upper half of the inner and back part of the arm joining the internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral.

On the right side the fascia is left. the nerve of Wrisberg especially, be large, this nerve is small. A second intercosto-humeral nerve is often given off from the third intercostal, and it supplies the skin of the axilla and inner part of the arm. Directions.—U the subject being dissected be a male the student must proceed to the examination of the axilla; but should it be a female, he should first examine the relations and connections of the mammary gland, then remove and dissect it. The Mammae are glands which secrete the milk, and are accessory to the reproductive system. A large class of animals (named mammalia) are distinguished by possessing these organs. They are envek-)ped in a

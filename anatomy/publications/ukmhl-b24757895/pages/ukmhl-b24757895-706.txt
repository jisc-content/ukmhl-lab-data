In the latter case it would be altogether below the base of the triangular ligament, would cross the front of the ischio-rectal fossa, and would be very liableto be wounded in the lateral operation for lithotomy. On the other hand, should it arise from an accessory pitdic artery, it would be placed more forward than usual, and is out of danger in the latter operation. Muscular Branches are given off to the constrictor urethrae, and levator and sphincter ani, as the vessel is about to pierce the posterior layer of the triangular ligament. The artery of the corpus cavernosum (profunda penis), is one of the terminal branches of the internal pudic, arising from that vessel Fig. 491.â€”Deep dissection op the male perineum and gluteal region. The digsection has heen carried deeper ou the right side of the subject. while it is placed between the crus penis and the pubic ramus. It pierces the crus obliquely, and runs forward in the corpus cavernosum by the side of the septum pectiniforme, supplying it and the erectile tissue of the bulb. The Dorsal Artery of the Penis is, in size and direction, the continu- ation of the pudic. It runs up between the crus and pubic symphysis and pierces the suspensory ligament of the penis, running forwards along the dorsum of the penis immediately beneath the skin, parallel with, but external to the dorsal vein. At the glans penis it divides into two branches which supply the glans and prepuce. It supplies the skin of the

509 DISSECTIOX OF THE LOWER LIMB. gliiling, which is possible in tliese joints. This arthi'odial motion is such, that when the ])Osterior part of the os calcis glides in and up beneath the astmgalus, oi* vice versa, the astragalus passes down and out above the os calcis, and the cuboid extremity of the os calcis also moves down and out. The head of the astragalus is supported in standing by the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digitorum tendons : and the posterior, external, and calcaneo-scaphoid ligaments are sti'ctched. Articulations of the Second Row.â€”The scaphoid, cuboid, and three cuneiform bones are connected by dorsal, plantar, and interosseous liga- ments. The dorsal ligaments are small bands of parallel fibres passing from Fig. 41!).- Ligaments ov tiiu dorsum and outeh side of left foot each bone to the one with which it articulates. Those between the os calcis and cuboid are less strong than the corresponding plantar ones. Those between the scaphoid and the three cuneiform ai'e three longitu- dinal bands near to each bone, the innermost being the widest and strongest, and extending around the inside of the joint into the sole of the foot. The jjlantar ligaments have a similar arrangement in the sole of the foot. The interosseous ligame^its are four, and consist of strong transverse fibres between the rough non-articuUir surfaces of the contiguous bones.

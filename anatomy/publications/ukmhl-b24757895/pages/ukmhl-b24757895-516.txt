Relations.—At first it lies on the tibialis posticus, but in the greater part of its course it is imbedded deeply in the flexor pollicis, in a groove between the fibula and the interosseous membrane. In the upper part of its course it is covered by the deep fascia and its companion nerve, and gastrocnemius; and below by the flexor longus pollicis. At its outer side is the fibula; on its inner side, at its upper part, the tibialis posticus. Branches.—These are muscular, nutrient, anterior peroneal, and com- municating. The Muscular branches supply the soleus, tibialis posticus, flexor pollicis, and peronei. The Nutrient pierces the tibialis posticus, and enters the foramen about the middle of the back of the fibula. The Anterior peroneal pierces the interosseous membrane about two inches above the external malleolus beneath the lower and outer border of Fig. 356.—Dissection of i>fNEE side of left foot. 6 is on tlie flex. long, dig., and the tendon of tib. post, is between It and tibia, c is on lower piece of ant. ann. lig. the tibialis posticus, or passes below that membrane to the front of the leg and passes beneath the peroneus tertius to the front and outer side of the tarsus, where it anastomoses with the external malleolar and tai'sal arteries. The Communicating branch is given ofiF just above the ankle, and joins a similar branch from the posterior tibial. A second arch, a little lower down, sometimes exists between these vessels. The Posterior tibial veins are formed on the inner and back part of the foot by the junction of the plantar. They accompany the artery and receive branches corresponding with those of the posterior tibial, and in their course receive the peroneal veins, being joined by the saphenous vein, and they finally unite with the anterior tibial at the lower edge of the popliteus muscle to form the jDopliteal vein. The valves in the deep veins of the leg are numerous.

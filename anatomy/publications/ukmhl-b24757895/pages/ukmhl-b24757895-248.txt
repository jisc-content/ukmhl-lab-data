HUMAN MOJtrilOLOGY. 212 the extensor secundi to the back of the carpus, where there is a reddish gangliform enlargement beneath the extensor communis, from which filaments are distributed to the ligaments and articulations of the caqjus. It supplies all the muscles of the deep layer and those of the superficial with the exception of the supinator longus, extensor carpi longior, anconeus and sub-anconeus, which are supplied directly from the musculo-spiral. The Radial Artery at the Back of the Wrist.â€”In this situation the artery, with its veins, winds below the radius and across the back of the' carpus to enter the palm at the first interosseous space and between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. It first lies rather deeply on the external lateral ligament of the wrist, being crossed by the extensors of the thumb, but afterwards it is more superficial and is crossed by the extensor secundi. Superficial to it in this situation are the skin, sub- cutaneous veins and some filaments of the radial and external cutaneous nerves. Its branches in this situation are small, but numerous. They are the posterior carpal, dorsal interosseous, dorsales pollicis, and dorsalis indicis. The Posterior or Dorsal Carpal Branch is given off from the radial beneath the thumb extensors, and crossing the carpus to the inner border of the hand, anastomoses with the posterior carpal of the ulna to form the posterior carpal arch. From this arch branches ascend to anastomose with the termination of the anterior interosseous artery and with the posterior interosseus. Others descend to the metacai-pal spaces, and run along the inner side of the dorsum of the hand and little finger. The vessels which lie between the metacarpal bones are three, and are properly named the dorsal interosseous arteries. Those for the third and fourth intei'osseous spaces run down on the coi'responding interossei muscles and divide at the cleft of the fingers into two collateral digital vessels, which run along the contiguous sides of the dorsum of the digits. At the cai-pal ends of the interosseous spaces they anastomose with the perforating arteries from the deep palmar arch, and near the heads of the metacarpal bones they join the digital branches of the superficial palmar arch. The Fii'st Dorsal Interosseous or Metacarpal branch arises beneath the thumb extensors, sometimes with the posterior carpal artery, and runs on the second dorsal interosseous muscle, anastomosing behind with its corresponding ^perforating branch from the deep palmar arch, and in front with the digital branch of the superficial arch, and su^Dplies the adjoining sides of the index and middle fingers on their dorsum. The Dorsales Pollicis are two small vessels, which arise separately, or by a common trunk, near the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb and extend along the sides of the dorsal aspect of the thumb, supplying it and anastomosing with its palmar digitals. The Dorsalis Indicis is a small branch along the radial side of the dorsum of the index finger. It gives some twigs to the abductor indicis and anastomoses with the palmar digitals. Directions.^The posterior interosseous nerve should be dissected out of the supinator brevis, and the attachments of this muscle reflected, so as more thoroughly to understand them and its relations. The different compartments beneatii the posterior annular ligament should be opened, and the tendons with th^ir synovial sheaths examined; and when this has been done, the offset from the gangliform enlargement of the posterior

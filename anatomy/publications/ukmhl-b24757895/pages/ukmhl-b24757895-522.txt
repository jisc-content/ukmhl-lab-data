The outer portion is thicker than the inner, and thicker behmd than in front, extending from the os calcis to the outer side of the base of the fifth metatarsal {calcaneo-metatarsal ligor- ment). It is continuous with the middle portion of the plantar fascia, and externally with the fascia of the dorsum of the foot. The inner portion is very thin over the abductor pollicis, is fixed behind to the Fig. 362.—Superficial dissection op right foot. 6 6. Collateral digital arteries. The transverse processes joining the five divisions of the plantar fascia, and fixing down the tendons, are shown ; also the digital sLeaths of the tendons with their oblique and transverse processes. internal annular ligament, and is continuous with the middle portion of the plantar fascia, and internally with the dorsal fascia. Dissection.—Before removing the plantar fascia to expose the first layer of muscles, the student should examine the intermuscular septa. To do this, a longitudinal incision through the middle central piece should be made, and a transverse one near the heel. It must then be reflected from the subjacent flexor brevis digitorum until the septa on either side are reached. It will now be seen that the flexor brevis digitorum is en-

415 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. Actions.—Acting from above it extends the femur and also abducts and rotates it out. It is also a tensor of the fascia lata. Acting from below it fixes the pelvis upon the head of the femur maintaining the erect position. In standing on one leg it can turn the face to the opposite side by drawing the sacrum towards the femur. If the hip joint be bent, as in sitting, it can act as an extensor by moving back the pelvis, and is the chief muscle in raising the trunk from a stooping posture. Nerves.- It is supplied in its lower two-thirds by the inferior gluteal Fig. 301. -Muscles of the buttock and thigh. External aspect. branches of the small sciatic nerve. Its upper third being supplied directly from the sacral plexus. Varieties.—It may be partly or entirely bi-laminar. It may be con- nected with an extra muscle, the agitator caudm, which is attached to the lowest piece of the sacrum, and to the coccyx. It may only be attached to the last two sacral vertebrae, or may have a high fascial slip of origin from the lumbar aponeurosis. Dissection.—Cut through this muscle near its origin, being cnrefiil of the great sacro-sciatic ligament beneath it; note the origin of its lower fibres from this ligament. The vessels and fascia beneath the muscle will

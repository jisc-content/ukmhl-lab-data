607 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. the hand. They extend to the end of the phalanx, where, like the corre- sponding nerves, they end in a small arch which gives offsets to the sides and ball of the toe and to the bed of the nail. The vessel to the second toe joins a branch from the dorsalis pedis. They form loops beneath the flexor tendons neai' the fronts of the proximal and middle phalanges, and supply the phalangeal articulations. Origin of flex. brev. dig Alid. mill, dig., cut -.

The plantar interossei muscles are shown. The student will note from this description that, in the sole, the plantar arch supplies both sides of the three outer toes and the outer sides of the second ; the inner side of the second and both sides of the great toe being supplied by the communicating and hallucis branches of the dorsalis pedis. The external plantar artery is the larger, and supplies both sides of the three outer toes and the outer side of the second. The

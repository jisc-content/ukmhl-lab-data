The Median Basilic Vein is more horizontal than the preceding, and crosses to the inner side of the limb between the biceps and pronator radii teres over the brachial artery. The deep fascia of the arm and the bi- cipital fascia separate it from the brachial artery. It is larger than the median cephalic. Some cutaneous twigs of the internal cutaneous nerve are over it and larger branches of the same nerve behind it. Biceps Ext.

Bicipital fascia and intercrossing of its fibres with tlie deep fascia. This vein is generally selected to bleed from because it is usually larger, more superficial, and more readily compressed; but, as it crosses the brachial artery, it should be opened in a part which is away from that vessel. The Basilic Vein is of large size, and formed by the union of the anterior and posterior ulnar veins, and, commencing near the inner condyle, ascends with the brachial artery to end either in one of the venaa comites of the brachial or to be continuous with the axillary vein. The Cephalic Vein comes mainly from the outer or median cephalic branch of the median, the radi;d vein being frequently very small. It

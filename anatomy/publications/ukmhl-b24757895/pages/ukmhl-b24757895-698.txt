662 HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. serted over the dorsal vein can assist in maintaining erection, and the middle fibres are stated by Krause to assist in erection by compressing the erectile tissue of the bulb and keeping the corpus spongiosum distended. Relations.—Superficially, vfith. the deep layer of the superficial fascia; deeply, with the bulb and urethra for three inches in front of the triangular ligament; externally, with the superficial perinasal vessels and nerves and erector penis; posteriorly, with the transversus perinaei and transverse artery; and the artery of the bulb pierces it. Nerve.—The peringeal. Variety.—The deeper fibres investing the most prominent part of the bulb are separated by some thin areolar tissue from the superficial layer. Fig. 483.—SuPEKFiciAL dissection of perineum. The deep layer of the superficial fascia is reflected, and on the left its continuation with the triangular ligament is shown. They join the corresponding part of the muscle of the opposite side by a small tendon above the urethra. Kobelt has described them as a separate muscular stratum, and named the muscle compressor hemisphericws bulbi. Dissection.—Divide the ejaculator on one side longitudinally, and re- flect it from the penis so as to see its junction with its fellow above the urethra and above the corpora cavernosa. The Transversus, or Transversalis Perinsei, is a narrow, thin, inconstant muscular slip which crosses the perina^um obliquely along the base of the triangular ligament. It arises by a small tendon fr om the inner and fore- part of the ischial tuberosity, and passing forwards and inwards joins the

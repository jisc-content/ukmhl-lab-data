HUMAN MOIiFHOLOGY. 288 bone of the forearm. If the ulna be broken it cannot support the radius in its rotation, and if the radius be broken it cannot move in its entirety. In setting fractures of one or both bones the splints should be applied with the hand supinated, because then the bones are most separated, and lie side by side. After the splints have been applied the hand may be placed in a semi-prone position, and it and the forearm supported in a large sling. Joints of the Carpus.—These are, first, the articulations of the first carpal row; second, those of the second; and third, those of the two rows with each other. The pisiform does not enter into the carpal articulation, but has a separate one with the cuneiform. Dissection.—Remove all the tendons and cellular tissue from the Fig. 213.—PosTEnioB view op articulations about left weist. hand, clean the ligamentous bands, and define the bands passing from the pisiform to the unciform and fifth metacarpal bones; also prepare the ligaments connecting the second row of carpal bones with each other and with the metacarpals. Joints of the First Row.—These are arthrodia. The articular surfaces are coated with a thin layer of cartilage, and united by two dorsal, two palmar, and two interosseous ligaments. Of the three bones of the first row which enter into these joints, the middle one, the semilunar, is joined to the lateral bones ; namely, the scaphoid on the outer and the cuneiform on the inner side. The Palmar Ligaments are transverse, less strong than the dorsal, and placed deeply under the anterior annular ligament.

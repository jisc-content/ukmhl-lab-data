DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 571 forming part of its articular cavity. Its under surface rests ori the tibialis posticus tendon, and its upper is lined by the synovial membrane from the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation. The articulation between the os calcis and the cuboid has fom- ligaments, two dorsal and two plantar. The former are the superior calcaneo-cuboid and the internal calcaneo-cuboid or interosseous; the plantar are the long and short calcaneo-cuboid. The superior calcaneo-ciLhoid ligament is a narrow^ thin fasciculus Int. oalc.-astrag._[S-- lut. calc.-scapli. Scapli.-cuboid Cuneo-scaplioid lutcr-ciineifm. larso-iuctatarE. Lat'.Ugts..

On the dorsal aspect of the joint it may be situated at the outer border of the foot, and it is occasionally divided into two. The internal calcaoieo-cuboid, or interosseous ligament, is a strong, short, thick band, passing from the os calcis, in the groove between it and the astragalus, and closely blended at its origin with the superior calcaneo- scaphoid ligament to the cuboid. It is inserted into the inner side of the cuboid, and forms one of the main ligamentous bands between the first

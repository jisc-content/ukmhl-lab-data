262 HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. Relations.—SitperficiaUi/, with the inner piece of the pahnar fascia, and the palmaris brevis; deeply^ with the flexor ossis metacarpi; outside, with the ilexor brevis minimi digiti. Action.—It removes the middle finger from the rest, and can then flex the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. Nerve.—The ulnar. Varieties.—It is sometimes partly divided into two or three slips, and is occasionally imited with the flexor brevis. The Flexor Brevis Minimi Digiti is on the same plane as the preceding muscle, but at its radial side, and is separated at its origin from the abductor muscle by a small interval through which the deep branch of the ulnar nerve and artery pass into the palm. It arises from the tip of the 1. Ant. aim. lig. 2. Insei'tiuii of puliu. loug. 3. Abd. poll. 4. 0pp. poU. 5,5. Flex. brev. poU. 6. Add. poll. 7. Abd. indicia. 8. Abd. mm. dig. 9. Oppns. miu. dig. 10.

Relations.—Superficially, with the inner piece of the palmar fascia of the palmaris brevis ; deeply, with the opponens, and between it and the abductor are the deep branches of the ulnar artery and nerve. Action.—It flexes the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. Nerve.—The ulnar. Varieties.—It is sometimes absent, and then the abductor is large. The Opponens, or Adductor Minimi Digiti, is placed beneath the others, and is triangular, and resembles the opponens pollicis in being attached to the shaft of the metacarpal bone. It arises from the unciform process

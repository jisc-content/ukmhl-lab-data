611 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. the teuclon passes beneath tlie astragahis it contains a fibro-cartilage or sesamoid bone, and a process from it passes back to the margin of the groove in the os calcis for the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. The tendon of the peroneus longus will be found in a fibro-osseous canal of the cuboid lined by a separate synovial membrane, and will be observed to pass inwards to the groove on the under surface to be inserted on the outer surface of the internal cuneiform bone and base of the metatarsal of the great toe, and sometimes it sends a slip into the basp of the second metatarsal. As the tendon of the peroneus longus passes underneath the cuboid it becomes thickened, and contains a fibro-cartilage or a sesamoid bone. The sheath of the pei'oneus longus is crossed at its outer portion ..•Cuboid .Tendon of peron. brevia Tendon of peron. longua Fig. 389.—To show insertions of peroneus longus and brevis.

Internally, this sheath consists only of areolar tissue, and it is lined by a separate synovial membrane. Another method of dissecting the foot.—If the student be dissecting the foot for the second time I can recommend the following plan, which preserves the relations of the parts and is therefore very useful for making museum preparations. After reflecting the skin and subcutaneous fatty tissue, the three partitions, middle, outer, and inner of the sole, should be separately opened in the mid-line of each space, and their contents made out. Then a thin layer of the os calcis, having attached to it the flexor

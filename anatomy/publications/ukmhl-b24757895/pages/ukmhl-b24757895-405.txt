DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 3G9 side of the femoral shaft, and is beneath the sai-torius, being separated from the bone by a considerable extent, in consequence of the artery run- ning a straight course, and of the projection of the neck and shaft of the femur outwards. It occupies about two-thirds of the thigh, and is super- ficial in Scarpa's triangle, but deeply placed beyond it. Relations.—Only the superficial portion of the artery is now being dissected. The deep part will be studied in the next section; but for Gimbernat's lig Pectiiiens Pftrt femoralsheath Spermatic cord Int. saphen vein Add.long. Ext. cut", nerve Poilpart's lig. Ext. cirflx. a.

In front of it, from above downwards, are the skin and superficial fascia, fascia lata, the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve and some branches of the anterior crural, the sartorius, the long saphenous nerve and vein, and the aponeurotic covering of Hunters canal.

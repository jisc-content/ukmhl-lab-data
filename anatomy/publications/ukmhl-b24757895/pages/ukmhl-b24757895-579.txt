DISSECTION OF THE LOfVER LIMB. 543 clincd back it will be drawn forwards by this and the other muscles on the trout of the leg. Net've.—The anterior tibial. The Peroneus Tertius is seldom separate from the extensor longus digitorum, below which it is placed. It might be described as the fifth tendon of the extensor longus. It arises from the lower fourth of the narrow portion of the internal surface of the fibula on its outer side, from the lower part of the interosseous membrane, and from the intermuscular septum between it and the peroneus brevis. Its tendon passes through the same compartment of the annular ligament as that of the extensor longus, and is inserted into the dorsal smface of the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe on its inner side. Tendons Fig. 42.3.—Tendons and muscles on dorsum of right foot. Relations.—On the outer side is the long extensor, with which it is joined at its origin, and with which it passes through the same compart- ment of the annular ligament. Varieties.—It may be absent or it may be as large as the long extensor. Occasionally it is inserted on the fom-th metatarsal bone, or it may send a slip to the extensor tendon for the fifth or fourth toe, or to the fourth dorsal interosseous muscle. Action.—It flexes the ankle, and helps to draw forwards the tibia when the leg is advanced in walking, Nerve.—The anterior tibial. Synovial sheaths of the tendons.—There are usually three of these for the extensor tendons; one for the tibialis anticus, one for the extensor proprius hallucis, and another for the extensor communis digitorum and

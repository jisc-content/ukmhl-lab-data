HUMAN MORFHOLOGY. 446 these muscles assist in foiming that severe contraction of the body called opisthotonos, in which only the heels and the occiput touch the bed. This muscle, with the other hamstrings, will raise the trunk from the stooping position. Nerve.—The great sciatic. The Semimembranosus muscle takes its name from the membranous expansion on the anterior and posterior aspects of its tcpfjer tendon. It is placed at the back and inner side of the thigh, is tendinous at both ends, and ariseshja thick tendon from the outer and upper facet on the back of Vast. int. ..Sartorius Int.snpli. vein drawn forwards Int.sapli. nerve Fig. 327.—Tendons, etc., on inner side of left knee. All oponing lias been made at the posterior part of tlie sartorius to show tlie internal saphenn nerve and tendon o£ gracilis. The bursa (C) is common to the inner head of the gastrocnemius and semi-menibraiiosus. the tuber ischii, above and external to the origins of the biceps and semi- tendinosus. It passes down, and is thick and fleshy where it bounds the popliteal space. Its lower tendon goes to be inserted in three pieces, the middle and strongest piece is inserted into the inner and back part of the internal tibial tuberosity, beneath the internal lateral ligament; this portion of the insertion sends an expansion over the popliteus muscle. The internal process of insertion is horizontal and passes beneath the intercal lateral ligament, being inserted into a groove along the inner side of the internal tuberosity. The posterior process of insertion passes back,

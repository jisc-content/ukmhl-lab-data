HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 296 In Flexion the phalanx glides forwards under the head of the meta- carpal bone, which is left exposed, and forms the knuckle. The extensor 111.

In Extension the phalanges move back and form an angle with the Fig. 221 Antero-posteeior vertical section through radius, semilunar, mag- num, METACARPAL, AND PHALANGES OP MIDDLE FINGER, SHOWING SHAPE OP JOINT SURFACES AND THE SYNOVIAL CAVITIES. 1.

The lateral ligament on that side of the joint which is convex will be tightened, and the opposite one will become relaxed. These movements are freest in the thumb, and the little finger enjoys more ab- than adduction.

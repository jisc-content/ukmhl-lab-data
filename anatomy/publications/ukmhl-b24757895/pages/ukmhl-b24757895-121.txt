CHAPTER IV. DISSEC TION OF THE UPPER LIMB. PART I. THE THORACIC WALL AND AXILLA. Directions.—The body being on its back, raise the thorax to a suitable height by a block, and j)lace the arm on a board at a right angle to the trunk, the hand being supinated. The chest, wall, and axilla must be dissected and learned in from two to three days, so as not to interfere with the dissectors of the thorax; and when the body is turned, the student must dissect the supei-ficial muscles of the back, which in most dissecting- rooms belong to the possessor of the arm. Fig. 24—Showing the position of the subject and the incisions for dissecting the front of the body. Surface Markings—Beiore removing the skin, the student must make himself quite familiar with the bony projections, muscular promi- nences, and depressions between them, which serve as landmarks, and are used as guides to the position of parts beneath the skin and subcutaneous tissues. He should also, by moving the various joints with the one hand and feeling over them with the thumb and fingers of the other, appreciate any alterations in the relation of parts produced by the various move- ments. Bony Prominences.—On the front and upper part of the chest the line of the clavicle can be made out in all persons. When the arm rests quietly by the side, the clavicle is slightly inclined downwards, but when the body lies on the back, the shoulder falls back and the clavicle rises a little, the weight of the arm being removed. Near the acromial end of the clavicle, on its anterior aspect, there is in many elderly persons a spinelike bony projection. This is normal, but may be mistaken for an exostosis. Note the forward curvature of the inner half or more of the

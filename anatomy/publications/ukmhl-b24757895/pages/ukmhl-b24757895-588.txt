552 HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. The Anterior Tibial Nerve (anterior interosseous) passes obliquely forwards under the extensor longus digitorum to the front of the inter- osseous membrane, and reaches the outer side of the tibial artery about the middle of the leg; it then crosses the anterior tibial vessels once or more and at the ankle joint is external to them. It there divides into an external and internal branch. Its branches are, muscular to the tibialis anticus, extensor longus digitorum, peroneus tertius, and extensor proprius pollicis, and the two terminal branches just mentioned. Tig. 431.—Arteries on dorsum op right foot. The External or Tarsal Branch passes out across the tarsus beneath the extensor brevis, and becoming ganglionic, like the posterior interosseous at the wrist, supplies the extensor brevis and the joints of the tarsus and metatarsus. The Internal Branch is the continuation of the nerve, and accompanies the dorsahs pedis artery, and at the fore part of the first interosseous space divides into two branches that supply the contiguous sides of the «

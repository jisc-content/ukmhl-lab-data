The saphenous vein, called so because it is evident on the surface of the fascia, joins the femoral vein through the lower part of this opening. The cribriform fascia is very adherent to the saphena vein and is somewhat funnel-shaped if the vein be pulled downwards. In studying this fascia the student must first thoroughly understand how it forms the saphenous opening, and then observe its various processes and septa. Pinch up with the forceps the sheaths of the muscles formed by it, and divide and sepa- rate each in the com-se of its fibres, displacing the muscles as little as possible. The Deep Fascia or Femoral Aponeurosis (more correctly apomyosis) is generally a strong, blueish-white, glistening membrane, whose fibres Fig. 238,â€”Superficial disbection ok inside of right knek, slightly altered PROM Godlee. interlace in various directions. It continuously surrounds the muscles and vessels, &c., of the thigh, and sends from its under sm'face, septa between the muscles, and also two strong processes which are attached to the outer and inner lips of the linea aspera, and which separate the muscles in front from those on the posterior and inner aspect of the thigh, giving partial origin to them. The position of these septa is visible on the surface of the fascia by white lines. This membrane, which from its extent is called the fascia lata, is thin in very fat subjects. There is another and less strong septum which isolates the inner and posterior groups of muscles. The fascia lata is much stronger on the outer and upper side of the

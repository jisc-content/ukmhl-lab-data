HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 224 The Muscular branches supply the muscles on the radial side of the forearm. The Swperficialis Voice is given off usually just where the radial is about to wind round the wrist. It is variable in size, in its place of origin, and in most instances ends in the muscles of the thumb, but in others it is larger, and passes between the thumb muscles, supplying them, and auas- Bioip. fascia Ead recui'.

It may be as large as the continuation of the radial. The Anterior Carpal is small and is given off near the lower border of the pronator quadratus, and runs inwards in front of the radius. It joins the anterior carpal from the ulnar, and forms an arch in front of and above the radio-carpal articulation, from which branches descend and supply the wrist joint.

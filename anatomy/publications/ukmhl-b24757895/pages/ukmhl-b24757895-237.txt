Opposite the iirst interphalangeal articulation this aponeurotic tendon divides into three slips, a middle and two lateral. The central is much thinner than the others, and is inserted into the base of the second phalanx ; the two lateral fiisciculi, passing on, unite by their contiguous margins, and are inserted into the base of the dorsum of the last phalanx. On the index and little fingers the tendons before dividing are joined on their inner sides by the special extensors for those digits. On the back of the hand the ring-finger tendon gives off two processes, one on each side, called the a. Post. ann. lig. 1. Ext. 0S3. met. poll. 1'. Insertion of oss. met. poll. 2.

These pass obliquely down to the tendons of the middle and little fingers. In consequence of this condition, the tendon of the ring- finger is held down as it were, and cannot be extended unless they also are extended. The tendon of this muscle for the index finger is only united to that for the middle finger by loose semi-transparent transverse bands of fibres, and is free in its action.

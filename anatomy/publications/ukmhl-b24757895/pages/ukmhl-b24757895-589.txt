653 DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. great and second toes, cominunicating with the internal branch of the niusc-ulo-cutaneous nerve. The Musculo-cutaneous Nerve runs between the peronei and extensor longus digitoruin to the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the leg, where it pierces the deep fascia on its front and outer side, and divides into two branches, internal and external, which are distributed to the dorsum of the foot and toes. Before piercing the fascia it supplies the peroneus longus and brevis, and then gives off some cutaneous filaments to the lower and outer part of the leg. The Internal Branch of the musculo-cutaneous crosses the ankle joint, passes along the inner side of the dorsum of the foot, and supplies the Fig. 432.â€”Arteries of the dorsum op left foot, inner side of the great toe and the adjacent sides of the second and third ; it also supplies the skin of the inner side of the foot and inner ankle, and joins the internal saphenous nerve on the inner side of the foot, and the anterior tibinl between the first and second toes. The External Branch is the larger, and p.isses along on the outer side of the dorsum of the foot to the adjoining sides of the third, fourth, and fifth toes. It also innervates the skin of the outer side of the foot and outer ankle, and joins the short .siiplienous nerve. Thti distribution of these digital nerves of the musculo-cutan.eous is variable, commonly thc;y supply all the toes on the dorsal aspect excepting

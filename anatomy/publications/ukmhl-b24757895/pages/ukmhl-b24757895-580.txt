The first extends commonly from about two inches above the annular ligament to about half an inch below it; the second extends from about half an inch above the ligament to about two inches below it; and the third, which is the most extensive, extends from about the same' distance above the ligament obliquely down and in to near the roots of the toes. One or more of these sheaths sometimes become dis- tended with fluid and form what are termed ganglions. The Anterior Tibial Artery corresponds to a line drawn from the inner side of the head of the fibula to midway between the malleoli. It is given off from the popliteal at the lower border of the popliteus muscle, and passes forwards through the oval aperture at the upper part of the inter- osseous membrane between the two heads of the tibialis posticus, and Fig. 42i.—DiAWEAM or the synovial sheaths of the extensoes of bight foot. resting on the interosseous membrane, mns down to the front of the ankle joint where it becomes more superficial, and at the lower border of the anterior annular' ligament it is called the dorsalis pedis artery. Relations.—In its upper two-thirds it is deeply placed, but becomes superficial at the lower third. It rests on the interosseous membrane at its upper two-thirds, and is connected to it by fibrous arches passing over the vessel. In the lower third it rests upon the front of the tibia and the anterior ligament of the ankle joint. In its upper thii'd it is between the tibialis anticus and extensor longus digitorum; in the middle third between the tibialis anticus and extensor pollicis; and in the lower third the tendon of the extensor pollicis crosses it, and it lies between the inner- most tendon of the extensor longus digitorum and the tendon of the

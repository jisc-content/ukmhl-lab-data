In rupture of the membranous urethra, which is contained between the deep layer of the middle fascia and the deep fascia proper, the ui-ine generally takes a similar com'se to that which it assumes when it is con- tined between the two layers of the middle fascia, because the deep layer • Skin of abdomen ' /!

It may however infiltrate back into the pelvis, and cause death by pelvic cellulitis or peritonitis.

Around the urethra the fibres radiate. The deep perinceal fascia or apomyosis will be better understood further on, when its dissection is reached. It is partly continuous behind with the pelvic fascia, and in front with the deep layer of the middle fascia, forming a separate pouch, partition, or compartment, in which are found the m^embranous pxirt of the xtrethra, the deep transverse and constrictor muscles, Cowper^s gland, and parts of the pudie vessels and nerves and U u

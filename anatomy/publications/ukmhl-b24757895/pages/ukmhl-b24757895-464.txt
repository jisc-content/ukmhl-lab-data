The inner surface of the tuberosity is grooved for the reception of the tendon, and is covered with iibro-cartilage and lined by a large synovial bursa. A longish synovial sac is commonly found between the tendon and the hip capsule. It sometimes communicates with that between the tendon and the tuberosity of the ischium, the two then form- ing one sac. Relations.—The sciatic vessels and nerves xe?,i on ii^jposterior surface, Fig. 311.—Deep muscles of the kiuht buttock. and its anterior surface is in contact with the back of the capsular liga- ment. Actions.—It abducts and rotates out the femur. Acting from below it will erect the pelvis and balance it on the femur, and if standing on one leg it will take the pelvis to the opposite side. Nerve.—A special branch from the sacral plexus coming from the junction of the lumbo-sacral with the first sacral. The ftuadratus Femoris is, as its name expresses, a quadrilateral muscle. It is flat and short, and passes horizontally out from the ischium to the great trochanter between the inferior gemellus and the upper edge of the

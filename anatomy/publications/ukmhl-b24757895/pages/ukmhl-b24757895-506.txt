470 HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. Along its inner border is the tendon of the plantai'is, and along its outer are the external saphenous vein and nerve which are superficial to it. The fleshy part of the muscle has the plantaris, gastrocnemius, fasciae, and skin behind it, and in front of it are the flexor longus hallucis, flexor longus digitorum, tibialis posticus, and posterior tibial vessels and nerve, which latter are separated from it by the deep transverse aponeurosis. Action.—The soleus extends the ankle pointing the toes, and if the latter rests on the groxmd it can raise the heel. The tendon is sometimes ruptured in sudden powerful contractions of both muscles.

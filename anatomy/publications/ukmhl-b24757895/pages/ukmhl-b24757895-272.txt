236 HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. These branches have been described with the dissection of the back of the forearm, but it may be here mentioned that the internal branch communi- cates above the wrist with the branch from the external cutaneous nerve. Dissection.—To expose the deep layer of muscles, divide the pronator teres or draw it to the radial side of the forearm. The other flexors should be divided about their middle, being careful of the median nerve between the sublime and deep flexors. Clean the muscles and define the anterior interosseous vessels and nerve, and the carpal arteries. The deep hori- zontal process of fascia must be removed to expose these structures. Fig. 147.—Deepest layer of the fouearm muscles. Right side. Beejr) Muscles of the Aoitenor Brachial Region.—There are but three muscles in this layer. The flexor pi'ofundus digitorum, lying on the ulnar side ; the flexor longus pollicis, on the radial side; and the pronator quad- ratus is between the bones near their lower ends, and beneath the tendons of the others. The Flexor Profundus Digitorum or Perforans is a large thick muscle arising from the upper two-thirds of the anterior and inner surfaces of the shaft of the ulna enclosing the insertion of the brachialis anticus above, and below extending to near the pronator quadratus. It also takes origin

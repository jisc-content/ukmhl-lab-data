308 n UMAN MORPIIOL O G 1l \ deepest, is formed from without inwards by the iliacus, psoas, peetineus, and small portions of the adductors brevis and longus. Contents.—This triangle is bisected into two nearly equal parts by the femoral artery, which passes through the centre of the hollow from the base to beyond its apex, and gives off its' cutaneous and profunda branches. On the inner side of the artery and close to it, between the margins of the peetineus and psoas, is the femoral vein which receives the deep femoral and internal saphenous veins. The large anterior crural nerve is placed about half an inch external to the artery, and is at first deeply seated be- tween the psoas and iliacus, but subsequently is more superficial, and divides into its anterior and posterior branches. The artery and vein are enclosed in a strong fibrous sheath (the femoral sheath), and are still further protected by the fascia lata, and are separated from each other by thin Fig. 268.—Dissection to show the upper part op the pemoral artery AND vein. The middle cutaneous of the anterior crural is seen on the artery. 7 is the long saphcua vein. fibrous partitions. Deep lymphatic vessels accompany the femoral vessels. They are joined by the superficial lymphatics and pass into the glands sm- rounding the external iliac artery. The Femoral Artery is the continuation of the external iliac, and extends from the lower border of Poupart's ligament to the mai'gin of the adductor opening, whence it is continued on into the popliteal space under the name of the popliteal artery. A line drawn from a little internal to the middle of Poupart's ligament to the inner side of the inner femoral condyle, will indicate the com-se of the vessel. It passes down the forepart and inner side of the thigh, and at the upper part of the thigh is slightly internal to the head of the femur, and is comparatively superficial, being uncovered by muscles, but in the lower part of its com-se it is on the inner

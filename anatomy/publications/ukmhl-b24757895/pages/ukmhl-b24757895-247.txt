211 DISSHCTIOX OF THE UPPER LIMB. Gniber have named a short set of fibres between the upper part of the melius and the annular ligament the tensor ligamenti orbicularis anterior. The Posterior Interosseous Artery is a branch of the common interos- seous from the ulna, and passes backwards through the space between the upper border of the interosseous membrane and the oblique ligament, iind passing between the extensor brevis and extensor ossis metacarpi, descends between the superficial and deep muscular layers (giving branches to them) to the lower third of the forearm, where it is more superficial, and lies along the outer side of the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris ; it then passes to the back of the wrist, where it anastomoses with the anterior interosseous and posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar arteries. Fie. 131.â€”Branches of left radial. Posterior view. The ooUaterftl digitals are shown between the fingers. Near its origin it gives off an interosseous recurrent branch. This is usually a large vessel and ascends on or through the supinator brevis, but beneath the anconeus and between the olecranon and external condyle, and anastomoses, after supplying these muscles and the elbow joint, with the posterior articular branch of the superior profunda, the anastomotica magna, recurrent radial and posterior ulnar recurrent. The Posterior Interosseous Nerve is the larger of the terminal branches of the musculo-spiral, is given off in front of the external condyle, and passes through the supinator brevis to the back of the forearm, and emerging from its lower border passes between the supei-ficial and deep luu.scles to the middle of the forearm, where it is much diminished iu size. It then descends on the back of the interosseous membrane beneath p 2

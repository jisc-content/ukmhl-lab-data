DISSECTION OF THE UPrEli LIMB. 297 Rotation is permitted to a slight extent in consequence of the laxity of the Ugaments. Circumduction is freest in the thumb, index, and little fingers, and it aids the thumb and fingers in the movement of opposition. The first phalanx of the thumb is flexed by the abductor and flexor brevis poUicis and by the flexor longus and adductor poUicis ; extended by the extensors primi and secundi internodii; abducted by the extensor ossis raetacarpi pollicis ; and adducted by the adductor pollicis. The first phalanges of the fingers are flexed by the flexors sublimis and profundus, the interossei and lumbricales; extended by the extensor com- munis ; adducted by the palmar interossei; and abducted by the dorsal interossei. Inter-phalangeal Articulations.—These are ginglymoid joints, and are united by an anterior and two lateral ligaments which are similar to those Fig. 223.—Transverse vertical section op eight hand to show the synovial cavities. of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints, the extensor tendon acting as a pos- terior ligament. The Anterior Ligament is not so strong, but has a similar attachment to that of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. The lateral ligaments are tri- angular, and each is fixed by its apex to the anterior part and side of the first and second phalanges. The ligaments of the joints of the second with the last phalanx are much less strongly marked than the others. A simple S3rnovial sac lines each joint cavity. Movements.—The inter-phalangeal joint can be flexed and extended. In Flexion the distal phalanx moves under the proximal, and the movement is limited by the extensor tendon, the posterior parts of the lateral ligaments, and by the meeting of the bones. This movement is most extensive in the first phalangeal joint. In Extension the distal phalanx moves backwards into a straight

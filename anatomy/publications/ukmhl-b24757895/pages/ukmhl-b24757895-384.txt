It passes in front of the femoral vessels and is adherent to the anterior layer of the femoral sheath, and to the deep layer of the superficial fascia. The concavity of this process is directed down and in. It was described by Allen Burns as the falciform ligament or ■process, and is called by some Burns' ligament. The outer and upper part of the saphenous opening is in front of the inner part of the femoral sheath and canal. The Inner Margin of the opening has a thin sharp border, bixt is less defined than the outer, being stretched over the subjacent pectineus mus- lut. saph. T. aii3 lyuiphat.

The student should pass his finger into the opening and observe that the margins become relaxed in flexion and rotation inwards, and vice versa. The former position is to be given to the limb in employing the taxis, which is the manipulation employed in attempting to return a hernia into its natural cavity. A hernia does not come out through the lower part of the opening because it is occupied by the saphena vein around which the cribriform fascia is very adherent, but it projects at the upper part of the opening just below the falciform process.

DISSECTIOA'- OF THE LOWER LIMB. 383 vastus externus. Many of the lowest outer and inner lateral fibres are attached directly to the sides of the patella and to the fascia lata at the sides of the knee. The deep set of fibres which may be called the crioreus, takes origin from about the middle two-thirds of the anterior aspect only of the femoral shaft. Its lower part reaches to within two or three inches of the articu- lar surface, and its origin is separated by a slight interval from that of the superficial fibres. The fibres of this set pass obliquely down and for- wards and are inserted into the posterior aspect of the tendon of the superficial fibres. There is a longitudinal band on the lateral surfaces of Fig. 278.—Muscles of the left thigh. Internal view. the femur on each side of the origin of this portion of the muscle, which is free from muscular attachment. This band varies in breadth in different subjects, and is broader on the inner aspect of the femur. It will thus be noted that the internal vastus arises from nearly the whole of the anterior, external, and internal surfaces of the femoral shaft, from the anterior inter-trochanteric line to within the lower fourth of the bone, and that its different fibres converge to a broad aponeurosis which is on the anterior surface of the middle portion of the muscle, and which covers the deep surface of its inner division (the vastus internus).

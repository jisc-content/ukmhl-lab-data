HUMAN MORPIIOL 0 G Y. 102 of the pectoralis minor to the clavicle, and expose the costo-coracoid mem- brane. The ceplialic vein, the anterior thoracic nerves, and the acromial thoracic ai-tery Avhich pierce this membrane will now be seen. The tendon of insertion and any of its expansions should now be examined, and the two ends for a moment replaced to study its relations. Relations.—In relation with its anterior surface, are the skin, super- ficial fascia, and fat, lower part of the platysma, and the mamma. Its posterior surface has the following relations (parts covered by the pecto- ralis major) : near the thorax are the sternal ribs and'costal cartilages, the pectoralis minor, serratus magnus, and intercostals, and near the axilla it is Fig, 37—Showing the deeper muscles bounding the axilla. in relation with the axillary vessels and nerves. Between the pectoralis minor and clavicle it conceals the subclavius muscle, the axillary vessels in their sheath, the branches piercing the sheath, and the anterior thoracic nerves. Below the pectoralis minor its folded lower border forms the anterior margin of the axilla, and near the humerus it rests on the biceps and coraco-brachialis muscles. Its upper border is parallel with the anterior border of the deltoid, separated by a slight interval which widens •towards the clavicle in which run up the cephalic vein, and the humeral branch of the acromio-thoracic artery runs down.

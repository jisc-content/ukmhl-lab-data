The Transverse Ligament of the inferior tibio-fibular joint is said by some to take the place of the posterior ligament. The anatomists who 1 External malleolus. 2.

The internal lateral or deltoid ligament has two layers, superficial and deep. The superficial Idyer is a triangular strong flat membrane, which is attached above to the apex and anterior and posterior borders of the internal malleolus. The anterior fibres pass forwards to be attached Fig. 444.—Ligaments about the ankle. Left foot, posterior view. to the scaphoid, joining the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. The middle fibres descend vertically to be fixed to the sustentaculum tali of the OS calcis ; and the posterior pass back and out, to be attached to the hinder part of the astragalus. The deeper layer is made up of strong, short, thick fibres, which pass from the groove on the under surface of the apex and from the apex of the malleolus to below the articular surface

HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 116 'posterior branches of all three trunks join to form the middle or 'posterior cord. These cords are external to the first part of the axillary artery, and lie aside each other in the anterior part of the plexus, but lower down they are arranged thus: the outer cord is external to the artery, the inner internal, and the middle behind, and they are then continued into the principal nerves of the limb. Another arrangement commonly met with is, that instead of three there are only two primav'y trunks which lie on the outer side of the artery; the one nearer the vessel is formed by the eighth cervical and part of the first dorsal; and the other by the fasciculus from the fourth, and Fig. 49.—Diagram of left brachial plexus, bepeesenting the second DESCKIPTION OP THE TEXT. SeEN FROM THE FRONT. The ptocnic from tlie fourtli and fitth is not shown. the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves; the third or posterior cord being formed a little lower down by the union of two branches, one from each of the two primary trunks. The relation of the three cords to the vessels is usually the same in both arrangements. Branches.—This plexus gives off bi'anches above and below the clavicle. It is only with the latter that we have now to deal. The External Cord gives off" the external anterior thoracic, the external, or musculo-cutaneous, and the external root of the median.

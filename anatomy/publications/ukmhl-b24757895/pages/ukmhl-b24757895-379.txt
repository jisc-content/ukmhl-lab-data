The deep part of the fascia lata is attached to the body and ramus of the pubes, to the ramus and tuberosity of the ischium, and to the ilio-pecti- neal line, in front of the insertion of the aponeurosis of the external oblique. It covers the pectineus, having over this muscle a thickening of transverse fibres passing from the spine of the pubes to the ilio-pectineal Fig. 239.â€”Right ext. saphena vein and its tributaries. 1.

Most of these fibres come from the lower end of the ligament of Golles, which is formed by the most internal fibres of the internal or superior pillar of the external abdominal ring. These fibres are part of the aponemrosis of the external oblique muscles and decussate behind the linea alba with those of the opposite side, to become continuous with the ligament of Cooper. This layer then joins the pelvic fascia through the fascia iliaca, and splits at the inner border of the psoas, in- vesting the lower portion of it and the iliacus, and is attached to the front of the capsular ligament of the hip. At the outer side, the gluteus maxi- mus is inserted into it by a fibrous expansion, and the fascia here encloses

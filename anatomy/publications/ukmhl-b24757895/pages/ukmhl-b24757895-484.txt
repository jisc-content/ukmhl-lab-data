It flexes and rotates the tibia in assisting the popliteus. With the knee straight it may extend the hip as in walking backwards ; and will limit flexion of the hip. It will assist the other hamstrings in supporting the pelvis and the femur. J^erve.—The great sciatic. Fig. 329.—Left gluteal, femokal, and popliteal arteries and their branches. Varieties.—It may arise higher up, i.e. chiefly from the back of the great sciatic ligament. It may be double or even absent. The Great Sciatic Nerve, below the pelvis, lies on the adductor magnus, and divides about the middle of the thigh into the two popliteal nerves. ►Sometimes, as has previously been said, it bifurcates much higher up. It is crossed by the long-head of the biceps and runs along the outer border of the semi-membranosus. At the upper part of the thigh it gives large

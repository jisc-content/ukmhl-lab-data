HUMAN MORFIIOLOGY. 400 first, arises opposite the middle of the adductor brevis, pierces the tendons of the adductors brevis and magnus, and divides into ascending and de- scending branches, which ramify in the hamstring muscles, the ascending twigs anastomosing with the superior perforating, and the descending with the inferior perforating arteries. It gives off the nutrient artery of the femur, which in the substance of the bone runs up towards the hip. The Thh'd or Inferior Perforating artery is given off below the adductor brevis, and pierces the adductor magnus below the insertion of the adductor longus, to divide into branches which supply the flexor muscles of the leg, anastomosing with the descending branches of the middle per- forating, and with the termination of the profunda or fourth perforating artery. Fig. 289.- Deep muscles on inneb side op the thigh. The adductor longus is removed. The Fourth Perforating vessel or Terminal Branch of the Profunda passes back close to the linea aspera, piercing the adductor magnus near the opening for the femoral artery. It supplies the short head of the biceps, and the other hamstrings, and inosculates with the third perforating and upper inner articular branch of the iDopliteal. There are three or four muscular or anastomotic branches which pierce the adductor magnus at some distance from the linea aspera, and anastomose among themselves and with the perforating arteries, in the hamstring muscles.

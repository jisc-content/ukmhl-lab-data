]61 UISSECTION OF THE VTPEIt LIMB. Behind, the long and inner heads of the triceps separate it above from the inner side of the humerus, the superior profunda artery and nmsculo-spiral nerve intervening; and below it is separated from the front of the bone by the insertion of the coraco-brachialis and by the braeliialis anticus. Inside it is in relation with the internal cutaneous and ulnar nerves, in its upper half, and in its lower half with the median. Outside is the Bi-acb. Auast. mag Sup. prof. Tiif. prof. The basilic vein is cut. The niedian nerve is over tlie artery, and tlie ulnar to its inner side, and part of tlie luusoulo- spiral near the vein. The bicipital fascia is over the vessel, just above its bifiu-cation into radial and ulnar. The biceps is external to the artery, aud the coraco-brachialis between it and the artery above, and just above both is the pectoraUs major, above which is the deltoid. Internal to the vein is the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, tielow which is that of the teres major, and behind t!ie superior pro- funda aud musculo-spii'al nei-ve is the long head of the triceps. At the ejbow-beiid the supinator lougus is outside the artery, the bicipital fascia above, aud the pronator teres inside it. Right brachial aeteuy and branches. commencement of the median nerve, and the coraco-brachiaKs and biceps muscles, which slightly overlap it. Two venae comites accompany it and are closely applied to the arteiy, being connected here and there by short transverse branches. Relations of the Bhackiai, Artery.

HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 503 third, and fourth metatarsal bones, and is inserted with the outer head of the flexor brevis poUicis into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe. Relations.—Beneath its outer border the external plantar vessels and nerves pass inwards, the flexor brevis poUicis being on its inner side. Actions.-—-It adducts the great toe to the middle line of the foot, and assists in flexing the metatarso-phalangeal joint. If the big toe be fixed, it will render tense the sheath of the peroneus longus. Nerve.—The external plantar. Varieties.—A muscle occurring in apes, the opponens hallucis, is frequently found. It generally is a slip from the adductor hallucis, and is inserted into some part of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The Flexor Brevis Minimi Digiti must not be mistaken for one of the outer interossei which it resembles. It lies on the metatarsal bone of the Mid-line of fi)ot F-fisanioiil bones Fig. 378.—Diageam of musci^es of left foot. little toe, and arises from the base of the metatarsal bone of that toe and from the sheath of the peroneus longus ; passing forwards, it blends with the inferior ligament of the metatarso-phalangeal joint, and is inserted into the base of the proximal phalanx of the little toe on its outer side, and by some fleshy fibres into the anterior part of its metatarsal bone. Relations.—Superficial to it are the abductor minimi digiti and plantar fascia; beneath it is the fifth metatarsal bone. Actions.—It flexes the metatarso-phalangeal joint, and draws inwai'ds and downwards the anterior part of the fifth metatarsal bone. Nerve.—The external plantar. Varieties.—A small muscle which appears to be a slip of the flexor brevis of the little toe (the opponens minimi digiti) is always united to it,

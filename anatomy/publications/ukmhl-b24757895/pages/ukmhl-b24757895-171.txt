Macalisier has described a prolongation of its tendon on the radial border of the fore- ai-m to the tendon of the supinator longus. This appeai-s to repeat the tensor'pliccG alaris of the bird.

Notice the large sacculated bursa between the acromion i:)rocess, the muscle, and the shoulder joint. Clean the circumflex vessels and nerves, remove the remains of the bm'sa, and examine the insertion of the muscle, noting how the main tendon separates from below upwards for some dis- Fig. G4.—Posteeiok view of right soapulak and circumflex arteries. tance over the under smface of the muscle. One or two of the larger tendinous intersections should be sought, to observe the penniform arrangement of the fibres which arise from them, and to define some wedged-shaped bundles of muscular fibres between the penniform bundles. These arise directly from the acromion, and are inserted into the tips of thf? lower tendinous septa, and others which spring from the ends of the upper tendinous septa are inserted into the humerus, between the lower septa. The parts enumerated as being beneath the deltoid in giving its relations should now be defined ; and this being done, the posterior circum- flex vessels and circumflex nerve should be followed through a quadrangular space between the humerus externally, and the long head of the triceps

DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 371 scrotum or labium, and anastomoses with branches of the superficial peri- neal artery. It may arise in common with the superior external pudic and it usually pierces the fascialata near the jjudic ramus. The Deep Femoral, or Profunda Femoris, nearly equals the superficial femoral in size, and arises from the outer and back jmrt of the common femoral, usually from one to two inches below Poupai-t's ligament. It is at first on the outer side of the superficial femoral, and then jDasses to the inner side of the femur behind the femoral arter}- and vein, and ends at the lower third of the thigh in a small branch which pierces the adductor Fig. 270.—Right femoral and profunda arteries and articular of popliteal. The antr. cniral iiervc, sartorius, and rectus are cut away. magnus, and after supplying the hamstring muscles, anastomoses with the inferior perforating and upper articular branches of the pojiliteal. It is the principal nutrient vessel of the thigh, and will be dissected presently. Varieties of the Femoral Artery and its Branches.—Pour or five cases in which the superficial femoral divided into two vessels and subsequently became reunited near the adductor opening to form a single popliteal artery are recorded. Much interest is attached to this anomaly from the fact that it was met with by Sir Charles Bell during the course of an operation for ligature of the femoral for popliteal aneurism.

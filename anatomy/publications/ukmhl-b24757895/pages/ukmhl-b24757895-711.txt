DISSECTION OF THE PEIilNAiUM. 676 superficial layer passes forwards through the labia majora (which are analo- gous to the two halves of the scrotum) to the groins, the raons veneris and around the anus. The deep layer, which is more membranous, is attached laterally to the rami of pubes and ischium, so that if bloody, serous, or purulent effusions be extravasated beneath it they may pass up on to the abdomen, back around the anus, but not into the thighs ; and if fluid be effused between the superficial and deep layers it may pass into all the siuTounding regions. In the deep layer there is a serous cavity occupied by the round ligament, this is surrounded by a thickish layer of cellulo- fatty tissue which is continuous with that which lines the inguinal canal. Broca has named this cavity the dartoic sac, as it is surrounded by white elastic fibres very like those of the male dartos. Fascia trausl*.

Dissections.—Eemove the superficial fascia and labia majora, and define the sphincter muscle surrounding the vaginal orifice. In this dissection the transversus perinaiii and erector clitoridis, which are arranged like those in the male but are smaller, will be exposed. The Sphincter vaginse corresponds to the ejaculator urina3 in the male. It sun-ounds the vaginal orifice, and is an elliptical orbicular muscle attached posteriorly to the central point of the perinasum where it blends with the sphincter ani and transverse perina^i muscles. Its fibres expand to surround the orifice of the vagina and vestibule, embracing on the outer X X a

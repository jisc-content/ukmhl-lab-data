DISSEC'/'IOX OF THE LOWER LIMB. 353 side of tlie artery, Imt before meeting on the inner side of the vein, a small trianguUir interval is left which forms the femoral canal. There is a thin septum or partition between the ai-tery and vein, and one between the vein and canal. The canal is internal, the aitery external, and the vein in the middle. The falciform process and the cribriform fascia are connected with, the inner part of the sheath in front, and the j^ubic portion and Cooper's ligament behind. Its outer border, which is straight, is pierced by the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve, and its oblique border by the saphena vein and superficial vessels and lymphatics. The dee'p femoral arch, when present, crosses the front of the sheath at its upper part. Fie. 251.â€”Deep dissection Oh- the kight iNGtiiNo-PEMOEAL regioit. Tlie relative positions of the vessels and nerves above and below Poupart's ligt. are depicted) also the transversalis abdominis. Some cutaneous filaments from the anterior crural nerve have already been described as piercing the sheath in fi'ont and behind. The Femoral Canal is the triangular interval inside the sheath to the inner side of the vein. It is consequently bounded in front by the fascia transversalis, and behind by the fascia iliaca. It is about half an inch long and extends from the base of Gimbernat's ligament to the upper part of the saphenous opening. It is larger above than below, where it is closed. It contains cellular tissue, some lymphatic vessels, and sometimes a gland. In front of it are Poupart's ligament, the deep femoral arch, and the uj^per part of the falciform process ; behind it is the peetineus, covered by the A A

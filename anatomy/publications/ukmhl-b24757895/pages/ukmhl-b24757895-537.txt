DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 501 ing to the big and little toes; three of them act upon the great toe and one on the little. Between the abductor pollicis, which is the middle muscle, and the flexor brevis minimi digiti on the inner side, will be found the interossei muscles of the next layer. It will be noted that three of these muscles run longitudinally, and one, the transversus pedis, passes across the foot at the roots of the toes. The Flexor Brevis Pollicis, or Hallucis, is pointed and tendinous behind, ansing from the inner border and under part of the cuboid bone and from the contiguous part of the external cuneiform ; also from the part of the tibialis posticus tendon which is attached to that bone. It bifurcates in front and allows of the passage of the long flexor between its heads of insertion, which are attached to the outer and inner sides of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe, a sesamoid bone being found in each Fig. 377.—The third musculab layer op the eight foot. tendon at its insertion. The inner head blends with the abductor pollicis, and the outer with the adductor. Relations.—Above it are the abductor pollicis, the tendon of the long flexor of the toe, and the inner piece of the plantar fascia ; beneath it are the tendon of the peroneus longus and metatarsal bone of the great toe ; outside is the abductor pollicis; and inside the adductor. Actions.—It flexes the metatarso-phalangeal joint of the big toe. Nerve.—The internal plantar, and occasionally a branch from the external plantar. The Adductor Hallucis Pollicis is external to the preceding muscle, and IS a large thickish fleshy mass, occupying the space between the four outer metatarsal bones, and crossing the foot obliquely. It arises from the sheath of the peroneus longus and from the tarsal ends of the second,

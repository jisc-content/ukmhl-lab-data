DISSECTION OF THE UrPER LIMB. 115 have seen it on two or three occMsions, iind once while operating in the axilla, rather behind than internal to the artery. The Brachial Plexus.—This large plexus, which furnishes the nerves of the \ipper limb, is formed by the jimction of the anterior trunks of the four lower cervical and greater part of the first dorsal nerves, receiving a fasciculus from the fourth cervical. It extends from the lower part of the neck to the axilla, and opposite the coracoid process it divides into large nerves for the arm and forearm. The part below the clavicle must now be dissected, and it will be seen that its relations are similar to those of the artery. The disposition of the nerves forming this plexus is liable to variation. Fro. 48.—Dissection of eight beachial plexus. The most frequent arrangement is the following:—The fasciculus, from the 4th, 5th, and eth cervical, unite at the outer border of the scalenus inedius and form an u^per or oxiter trunk; the Vtli cervical remains single and forms the middle or 'posterior trunk; and the 8th cervical and part of the 1st dorsal join between the scalenes to form a lotuer or %nner trunk. Just external to the scalenus medius each priviary trunk divides to form an anterior and posterior branch. The anterior branches of the outer and middle trunks join to form the upper or outer cord. The anterior 'jranc/i of the lower trunk itself forms the loiver or inner cord, nud. the I 2

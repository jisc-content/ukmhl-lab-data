DISSECTION OF THE LOWER LIMB. 851 sheath and the deep femoral arch will be exposed. Cut across the sheath about half an inch below Poupart's ligament, and hold up the upper part and observe the septa. Then pass the little finger up into the femoral canal and study its boundaries and relations, and note that the cellular sheath proper to the vessels is distinct from the femoral sheath. The peri-perito- neal cellullo-fatty tissue extends over and across the upper opening of the femoral sheath and canal, and therefore covers the internal femoral ring. The genito-crural nerve will be seen on the external iliac artery. Gimbernat's Ligament is a part of the insertion of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. It is three quarters of an inch long, and Fig. 248.â€”Dissection of thk kight kkmoral hegion, to show the fobmation op the saphenous opening. TliG iiitl. oblifino and sheath of rectus are ahowu. triangular, with its base, which is concave, thin and sharp, directed out- wards, and is continuous with the pubic and iliac parts of the fescia lata, and with Cooper's liga,ment. Its apex is at the pubic spine, its anterior margin is attached to Poupart's ligament, and its posterior to the ileo- pectineal line. In the erect position it is nearly horizontal, and it is larger in the male. The Femoral Sheath is a funnel-shaped, loose membranous tube around the artery and vein. The expanded end of the funnel is above, and the narrow end becomes continuous an inch below Poujmrt's ligament, with the cellular sheath proper to the vessels. Its anterior layer is formed by

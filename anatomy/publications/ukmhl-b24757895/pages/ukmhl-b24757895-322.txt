HUMAN MORPHOLOGY. 28G head of the radius is received into the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna. In the lower joint, the head of the ulna is received into the sigmoid cavity of the radius. This mechanism only permits of rotation of the radius round the upper and lower ends of the ulna, and the radius is prevented being displaced by the orbicular ligament above, and the fibro-cartilage below. A third articulation, the humero-radial, is also engaged in the rotatory movements of the radius. In Pronation, which is forward rotation, the upper end of the radius passes from without inwards, within the annular ligament, and without changing its position to the upper end of the ulna; but the lower end moves over the ulna, from the outer to the inner side, and its shaft Fig. 211.â€”Bones op left arm to show pronation and supination. obliquely crosses that of the ulna, describing half a circle, and carries with it the fibro-cartilage, which is movable at its insertion. The absence of ligamentous attachments to the upper end of the radius facilitates the movements at the upper articulation. The cup of the radius rotates for- wards in pronation, and backwards in supination, on the capitellum, while its raised border glides on the oblique surface which is between the con- dyle and the outer border of the trochlear surface. In Supination the sigmoid cavity of the radius glides backwards on the articular surface of the ulna, and the upper end of the bone rotates within the orbicular ligament from within outwards.

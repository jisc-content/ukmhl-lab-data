445 DISSECTIOA^ OF THE LOTFER LIMB. curves round the back of tlio^ inner condyle and inner Uibei'osily of the tibia, and is inserted into the upper part of the inner surface of the tibial shaft near to its anterior border just below the gracilis, to which it is imited, sending an expansion to the deep fascia of the leg. Its tendon lies beneath the expansion of the sartorius, and a tendinous intersection is usually placed about the middle of the muscle on its posterior aspect. There is often a bursa between the insertion of the muscle and the tibia. Relations.—Posteriorly, at its upjper part, is the gluteus maximus; and at its lower part, the skin and fascisB. Its anterior surface rests on the semimembranosus, adductor magnus, and inner edge of the gastroc- nemius. External to it, at its lower part, are the popliteal vessels, internal popliteal nerve, and superior articular vessels; and lower down it is in contact with the internal lateral ligament. Its outer border is also in contact with the biceps as far as the popliteal space. Action.—It is a. flexor of the knee, and afterwards can rotate the tibia inwards. If the knee be straight and the hip bent, it can depress the femur and extend the hip joint. It aids the other hamstrings in keeping the pelvis erect on the femvir, and in feats of strength will assist them to draw the trunk directly backwards, as when the body is made to form an arch with its concavity backwards.
